            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN I considered the numerous Quantity of Books, (and who knows how many fruitless ones) which this learned Age hath heaped upon one another, and thereby the great Remissness among Professors in reading, especially Books of this Nature; I was nevertheless for a long
<pb facs="unknown:039964_0004_1015C7DEE3FDBAD8"/>
Time very loath, yea unwilling (as my Friends very well know) to have these Traslations published: Yet the incessant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of some, and the obliging Importunity of others have so far prevailed upon me, that I have been induced to commit them to the Press; not expecting they will meet with a general Reception, or be worthily esteemed of, no, sorrowful Experience, and God's Word teacheth, (<note n="*" place="bottom">

O! how unwillingly do the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity of Professors hear that distinguishing manner of Preaching, and how strange seemeth it to them? As if a Servant of Christ should not any more make a Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the (<note n="‖" place="bottom">

               <hi>Precious and the Vile.</hi> Thereforefore it may be no great Wonder (but just Cause of Grief) if this Book
<pb facs="unknown:039964_0005_1015C7A807324CE8"/>
should not be acceptable to all its Readers; the more because it never was the Author's Design to please Men, in rocking those fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in sleep (<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Amos</hi> vi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>.</note>) <hi>who are at Ease in Zion,</hi> by Means of a general or undistinguishing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Preaching.</p>
            <p>As for the Reason why some may take it to be too distinguishing, is perhaps, because they have lived long, or yet live under an undistinguishing Ministry, or because they are not willing to be discovered to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in having a Knowledge of the State of their Souls, and with the Prodigal, <hi>come to themselves, Luk.</hi> xv 17. in order to go to Christ, and be saved in God's appointed Time and Way. But what Reason soever any one may have, it must nevertheless be granted, that the safest Method which any Ministers can take (who desire to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to their Lord, and profitable to the immortal Souls committed to their Charge) is to follow the Practice of the Prophets and Apostles, whose Method was <hi>not to use sordid Speeches and enticing Words,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii 4. or to detain their Auditors with a Relation of
<pb facs="unknown:039964_0006_1015C7E2131C3E10"/>
such and such like People being in the World, or in the Church; no, but thire Method was to speak some to the Purpose, and that it might be known what Sort of People they had in View; as, <hi>Thou art the Man,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xii 17. <hi>Thou hast neither Part nor Lot in this Matter, &amp;c. Act.</hi> viii 21. <hi>Thou Child of the Devil, Act.</hi> xiii 10. <hi>Ye foolish Galatians, Gal.</hi> iii 1. <hi>Ye Generation of Vipers, Matt.</hi> iii 7. And such like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions. This was also the wholsom Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the faithful Ministers in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, as in their Writings sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears, they not being daunted in the least to drive Peaple into Dispair, as our present <hi>Time-Servers</hi> (as <hi>Rurtherford</hi> calls them) imagine they ought, that's guarded against as if it was the only Way to be lost, whereas Thousands are Lost through Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness, when not one is lost through Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair: And it is nevertheless certain, that it is neither God's Word, nor sharp Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that brings People to Dispair, but their Sins.</p>
            <p>And perhaps it will be distasted by others because it is written in too mean a Stile, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing without any Embelishments of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rudition,
<pb facs="unknown:039964_0007_1015C7AA390CFEE8"/>
not being adorned with Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Expressions: But know, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor (as the Learned who know him testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy) may nevertheless be numbered among the Rabbies in <hi>Israel;</hi> and that he is never at a Loss to utter himself in all manner of suitable Expressions, both in a Rhetorical and Theological Way, when Occasion so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. But he has always thought it more proper and as his Duty, to express himself in such a plain manner, as he might be best understood by his Auditors, even by those of the meanest Capacity.</p>
            <p>And although his manner of Preaching is not to stuff up his Sermons with eloquent Expressions, such as are of Men's Composing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet his fluency of Preaching is well known and his exceeding Talent, of drawing on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Matter out of another, thereby discovering the State and Condition of his Auditors to themselves (as Experience can plainly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and) as by the following Discourses may sufficiently appear: But in this as in a great many more Translations, the Grace and Fluency of the Stile of the Original is much lost in the Translation, which the Translator is Sorry to say, in this is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
<pb facs="unknown:039964_0008_1015C7E39E77BE60"/>
by his Want of Letters and Practice in such Cases, this being the first Time that he ever took in Hand to translate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet he hath, as far as his Capacity would allow, kept to the Substance of the Matter.</p>
            <p>But not to be tedious, and as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, although it is not Expected, that this Treatise will be generally accepted, yet it may be desired by many, if it was only with <hi>Herod, to hear what this Troubler of Israel would say,</hi> yet it may be and is Earnestly prayed for, that instead thereof they may therein find Sweetness for their Souls and bring them to Salvation in an Effectual manner.</p>
            <p>But if any of it's Readers should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

I doubt not but that those will through the Lord's Blessing find sweet and sure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and rest for their wearied Souls. And whereas this Book is but small, plain and also Clear, therefore I think it needless to give a large Description of the Subject Matter treated on.</p>

them, for it seems as if nothing else was required than a Form of Godliness, and therewith they are contented, although the Power thereof is denied, if not scoffed at and opposed in those who endeavour to practice it.</p>
            <p>But not to exceed the Limnits of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, I shall draw to a Conclusion: Desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee, discreet Reader<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Accept of this small Treatise as a Fruit of the Author's real Love to the saving of thy Soul especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally those of, and near his own Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to whom this Book is especially De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated; and you need not Question but that the Reverend Author hath often been great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned for you; his Heart, without Doubt, hath often been seized with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion in seeing, and hearing of your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable and deplorable Conditions, especially for your great Want of a pure evangelical Ministry, seeing your Wanderings <hi>like lost Sheep having no Shepherd,</hi> and lying open for all manner of Errors; the which, as you may realy blieve, often caused him to bend his Knees to God to have Mercy on you in that respect. And who knows but you will not reap the Fruits thereof, nay,

how has the Lord favoured you since with many, yea, pure means of Grace so <hi>that the Lord is even now found of them who sought him not.

            <p>P<hi>Recious Things are Difficult to be obtained,</hi> was once a Proverb of the Antients. The Truth of this is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident in Things natural, even as Diamonds and white Pearl are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to obtain: But this is also evident in Things Moral, even as Wisdom and Virtue are
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:039964_0014_1015C7EBC8001880"/>
the most excellent upon Earth; for the more a Man possesseth thereof, the more acceptable he is in the Eyes of God, of Angels, and of Men; therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> sets such a Value upon it, <hi>Prov.</hi> iii 13,—19. But with what Difficulty are Things Spiritual obtained? For certainly there is Nothing more beautiful, Nothing more dear, Nothing more amiable, than those Spiritual Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Things which are with God in Christ. But how difficult is it to obtain them, since they must be fought for, and <hi>Violence used for the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> in order <hi>to take it with Violence, Mat.</hi> xi.</p>
            <p>This is likewise seen in that <hi>Merchant,</hi> who went <hi>and sold all that he had, to purchase that Pearl which was in the Field, Mat.</hi> xiii 44, 45. This <hi>Paul</hi> also sheweth, <hi>Know ye not, that they which run in a Race, run all, but one receiveth the Prize? So run that ye may obtain.</hi> And what was the Prize they were to run for? The incorruptible Crown of Glory which was han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged up at the End of the Race, and that is the Salvation which God giveth to his Childeren af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Life. And this is compared to a Crown, because God giveth them there the Victory over all their Enemies, and delivereth them from all Conflicts and painful Labour: But as long as they continue here upon Earth, it is unto them <hi>A Va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ey of Tears, a Way of much Tribulation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is clearly seen, if we do but cast an Eye on the Divine Words of the Text, wherein
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:039964_0015_1015C7B3A1B7ED70"/>
the Apostle sheweth, <hi>That the Righteous are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> altho' <hi>scarcely,</hi> that is, through many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, with much Difficulty. In the foregoing Verses the Apostel had shown the sorrowful and wretched End that will certainly befall the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, that are disobedient to the Gospel: But to show the Difference, he says in the Words o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Text, that the Righteous shall not have such an End, but that they shall be <hi>saved,</hi> although <hi>scarcely:</hi> But as concerning the ungodly Sinner he shall be lost.

This the Lord Jesus shews, <hi>Luk.</hi> xiii 24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the straight Gate.</hi> There he speaks of a <hi>Gate</hi> which is <hi>straight,</hi> through which we cannot go except we <hi>strive,</hi> and wherethrough we must break with Violence. Let us also take Notice of that remarkable Place, <hi>Matt.</hi> vii 13, 14. The Way of Life to Heaven is very narrow, because Man's whole Life must be regulated according
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:039964_0022_1015C7F46D8BF150"/>
to Gods Law, and the Law requires a strict and precise Godliness. So then, let us see how the <hi>Righteous are scarcely saved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. With Trouble and much Difficulty are the Righteous saved: For shall they be saved they they must be born again, <hi>Joh.</hi> iii 3. God cannot save them unless he first Spiritually enlivens them, <hi>who by Nature are dead in Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes and Sins, Eph.</hi> ii. Verily there is such Power required in transforming and regenerating of Sinners, as there was required in creating the whole World: Yea, much greater! For in the Creation there was nothing that was against God; but now all that is in a Sinner is <hi>in Enmity against God, Rom.</hi> viii 7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Shall he be saved he must believe; now that is only a Work of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> vi 29. And what belongs not thereto when a Man shall be brought to God, who conceits so much of himself and behaves himself in all his Words and Actions as if he was God himself! What belongs not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, to abase and humble haughty and arrogant Man, and cause him like a poor Beggar to creep as a Worm, and so to beg God for Mercy. <hi>Judas</hi> rather chose the Halter than to believe. O! what belongs not thereto, for one who depends upon his own Righteousness, and thereon is at Ease, to throw him off from his false Grounds, and to strip him naked, and drive him out of himself, as one helpless, desperate and lost, in order to lay hold on Jesus, and so through him to make Peace

with God, to be only saved through the perfect Righteousness of Jesus. It is hard to desire Christ, and to desire nothing else but Christ. It is Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to follow Christ all the Day, and never to be at Rest until he is found; and therefore, if we shall believe, certainly <hi>the Arm of the Lord must be revealed, Jes.</hi> liii Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> also saith, <hi>Eph.</hi> i 19, 20. <hi>That the Work of Faith is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Greatness of God's Power, according to the Working of his mighty Power which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the Dead.</hi> And therefore it is <hi>Scarcely.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. Shall he be saved, he must be converted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Luk.</hi> xiii. 3. And what belongs not thereto? For he must turn from Sin to Virtue from Satan to God, from himself and all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to Christ? and what is it not a Work for one who is in Darkness, yea even Darkness it self who cannot find the Way of Life who is unable and unwilling to return, who is so blind through Self love that he calleth his evil Heart good that hath such a salse Hope, from which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not nor will not depart, who is so captivated <hi>in the Snare of the Devil, taken Captive by him at his Will,</hi> 2 Tim. ii 26. who is a Child of Wrath, who is an Enemy of God. O! what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons not thereto to stay such an ungodly, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Sinner iu that his Way in order to awaken him. O! what belongs not there unto for such an one who hath forgoten and dispised God and has caused God to be his Enemy, who can

expect nothing else but Gods Wrath to Eternity, to bring such an one again to God, that he might see and enjoy his Favor and Love. Will he not think, <hi>How shall I again become recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with God, whereas I am an Enemy, a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of God, when I shall appear before his Holy Presence will be not then forthwith reject me and cast me into Hell?

            <p n="4">4. Shall he be saved, he must be sanctified for <hi>without Holiness no man shall see the Lord, Heb.</hi> xii 14.

            <p n="7">7 He is <hi>scarcely saved,</hi> because he must love God above all, and his Neighbour as himself, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxii 37. 40. he must <hi>bless them that curse him, do good to them that hate him, Matt.</hi> v 44. But what a difficult Thing is that, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to love his Enemies. And therefore he is <hi>scarcely saved.</hi>

            <p>An Ungodly (or <hi>Godless</hi>) then by virtue of the original Word which we find here, is such an one who neither honours nor serves God, as it's usual to call a Man <hi>Uncharitable</hi> who has no Charity, <hi>Remediless</hi> who knows no Remedy, <hi>Graceless</hi> one who has no Grace, and one who is poor and has no Money, <hi>Monyless.</hi>

            <p>REMARKABLE and not less certain are the Words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremiah, Jer.</hi> xvii 9. <hi>The Heart is deceitful above all Things, and desperately wicked, who can know it?</hi> By the Heart must be understood the Soul of Man, that Reasonable Being, endued

with Understanding, Judgment, Conscience, Will and Desires: Now this Heart of Man after the Fall, as long as it is not renewed by the Spirit of Regeneration, is</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deceitful:</hi> The Original Word that stands here is the same whence the Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> derived his Name from, because he in his Birth had hold of his Brother's Heel; but it likewise signifies <hi>Subtilty, Craft, Fraud, Snares, Jos.</hi> viii 13. <hi>Gen.</hi> xxvii 36. So that <hi>Deceitful</hi> here signifies <hi>Frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent, Reservation, inclining to deceive.</hi> Thus the Heart is constituted above all, <hi>yea, deadly,</hi> tending to Death, <hi>whereunto Death is fastned, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, evil above Measure:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So deceitful and corrupted are the Hearts of Men, the which they make manifest when they deceive themselves and others, in concealing and hiding of their subtile Wickedness. When <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

If they cannot wholly conceal the Evil of their Sins, then they lessen them; hence proceeds all Hypocrisy, by which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as if they were something: But that which doth manifest the Deceitfulness of the Heart more naked, is Self-Deceit, through which People think, that they are not so bad as indeed they are, and think they be in a good State, and hope to be saved, whenas they are indeed yet miserable Oblects of Damnation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:039964_0075_1015C87719B350B0"/>
So it was with the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> they <hi>thought themselves rich and increased with Goods, and to have need of nothing;</hi> and notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were <hi>poor, miserable naked, and blind, Rev.</hi> iii 17. <hi>If a Man</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself, Gal.</hi> vi 3. A Deceit really which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common, and likewise very dangerous: For in this Case, a Man, through Deceit of his Heart, is <hi>as a Man who is Hungry and thirsty, and in his Sleep dreameth that he eateth and drinketh, but when he awakes finds himself deceived, and still feels his Hunger and Thirst, Is.</hi> xxix 8. Thus also will the deceitful Heart, who thought it had been in the Favour of God, after Death and in the Day of Judgment be sensible of it's Deceitfulness, that its Imaginations have only been as a Dream, when he with an imaginary Heaven shall open his Eies in Hell. That a Man perswadeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be a Believer, without any Grounds, makes him the more wretched; it is deplorable, that this Deceit which is so dangerous, is likewise so common.</p>
            <p>From hence saith <hi>Solomon</hi> in the Words of our Text, <hi>There is a Way that seemeth right unto a Man, but the End thereof are Ways of Death.</hi> Words which cantain in themselves a (faithful and) true-hearted Warning, that every one that dreads for Self-Deceit, to be not deceived in his Expectation and become ashamed at the coming of the Lord Jesus, may well press upon his Heart.</p>

               <hi>Two principle Things we have here to take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The Proposal, <hi>There is a Way that seemeth right to a Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The definitive Sentence, <hi>But the End there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are the Ways of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Proposal</hi> we are more nearly to consider of what is spoken, to wit, <hi>A Way,</hi> and then the Imagination which a Man hath of it, namely, <hi>That it seemeth right unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Way</hi> is a manner of doing, or of living, which a Man useth, wherein he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to himself to attain some certain End; for a Traveller useth a Way as the Means to attain his proposed End; and thus we find mention made several times in the Holy Scriptures of <hi>Two Ways</hi> a <hi>broad</hi> and a <hi>narrow Way,</hi> and two sorts of Travellers, with their final Ends, we find, <hi>Ps.</hi> i 6. The <hi>the Lord knoweth the Way of the Righteous</hi> (their Actions and manner of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) <hi>but the Way of the Ungodly shall perish,</hi> that is their Life and Actions.</p>
            <p>Now there is a Way, a manner of living that <hi>seemeth right unto a Man,</hi> and notwithstanding hath a miserable End. <hi>Solomon</hi> here hath his Eye upon those People who deceive themselves, expressed with that Word <hi>a Man.</hi> And he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands by such a Man, such as he here, and in other Places calls <hi>Fools,</hi> as in <hi>Prov.</hi> xii 15. Which are not enlightned, not having the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:039964_0077_1015C878A3E4A8E0"/>
which is from above, without the Fear of God, therefore natural People whom he also call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Ungodly;</hi> in a Word, unconverted People, which is evident, because he ascribes unto them a miserable End. These have a Way, a Manner of living, wherein they propose to themselves a wrong End; on the one side aiming at earthly Happiness, Riches, Honour and Delight; <hi>This is their inward Thoughts, that their Houses shall continue forever, Ps.</hi> xlix 11. Who <hi>make a God of their Belly, who mind earthly things, Phil.</hi> iii 19. They are <hi>more Lovers of Pleasures, than Lovers of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii 4. In a Word they are Men of this World <hi>who have their Portion in this Life, Ps.</hi> xvii 14. And on the other side, they likewise aim at Heaven and everlasting Happiness, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they can keep the Earth no longer, then they would fain have Heaven, only to be delivered from Hell. And thus their <hi>Way which seemeth right unto them,</hi> is</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A Way of Sin,</hi> or a living in Sin, so that they give their Lusts the full Sway, and follow their corrupt evil Nature, know nothing of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying the Flesh, live in Envy, Strife, Hatred, Drunkenness, Revenge, Lying and Backbiting, (although one more than another) in one Word, such a Life wherein they willfully retain some Sins; thus <hi>David</hi> describes the Way of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, <hi>That he deviseth Mischief upon his Bed, he setteth himself in a Way that is not good, he abhorreth not Evil, Ps.</hi> xxxvi 2—5. That it
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:039964_0078_1015C83D1E5E42F0"/>
is such a Way, is manifest from the event, the which is <hi>Death, now the Wages of Sin is Death, Rom.</hi> vi 23.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Way is also <hi>A Way of Civility and Morality,</hi> thus out of Fear of Hell, Damage or Shame, or of natural Conviction of Conscience, they take heed of notorious gross Sins, and they are very diligent in practising the external and lesser Parts of the Law, and live so that no Body hath any thing to say against them. This can be seen in the rich young Man, <hi>Matt.</hi> xix 19, 20. <hi>All this he had kept,</hi> according to the outward Sense, but they give little heed to the internal Frame of their Hearts, not knowing the Spiritual Sense of the Law, which condemns the least Lust, the which they don't know.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It's likewise <hi>a Way of External Godliness,</hi> in the excercising and performing of some Duties which they observe, wherein they seek God daily, and have a Delight in the Knowledge of his Ways, as it is said of the self-deceiving <hi>Jews, Is.</hi> lviii 2. So that at the last Day many shall arise, and say, <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not eat and drunk in thy Presence, and in thy Name have cast out Devils, and in thy Name done many wonderful Works, Mat.</hi> vii 22, 23. <hi>Luk.</hi> xiii 26, 27.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yea even this is a W<hi>ay of outward Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Conversion,</hi> by which they are Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times convicted moved and troubled, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess their Sins and weep for them, as <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiv and 25. and with <hi>Agripa</hi> to be almost

            <p n="5">5. It is a <hi>Way of Self-Righteousness,</hi> that they do all this to rest thereon, setting their Salvation secure, and justifying their Conscience, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to satisfy God, supposing Heaven will in no wise escape them, having done so much Good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That's it which the Lord saith, <hi>Thou didst <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

that all these things are no sufficient Ground to have Right to Salvaiion, for the Lord Jesus shews that the temporary Beliver <hi>can likewise receive the word with joy,</hi> Luk. viii. <hi>Felix trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled when Paul preached to him of Judgment,</hi> Acts. xxiv. <hi>Agrippa, hearing Paul preach was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most perswaded,</hi> Acts. xxvi. <hi>Saul wept for his Sins and confessed them,</hi> 1 Sam. xvi. 15. and 14. 17. to be troubled, moved and touched and thereupon to become concerned and at a loss about his Salvation that is presently no saving Work of God's Favour, but often comes through a disturbed Conscience and goes over again like a Sea Sickness, whereas all these Things have place in such who are no less than upon the right Way, but a meer unconverted Man; thus it follows of its self that all these Things are no Sufficient Ground that your State is good and and well pleasing to God, and from whence Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation will follow.</p>

When they look on themselves, the Sense of Spiritual Want and inability causes them to see themselves void of all Boasting, seeking their Refuge in the Fullness of <hi>JESUS:</hi> But also the Lords People are <hi>meek,</hi> by Virtue of that low and humble Frame of their Hearts, which is a Fruit of God's Spirit in the Believers, <hi>For the Fruit of the Spirit is Gentleness, Gal.</hi> v 22. which they shew in a friendly Conversation with their Neighbours, without Wrath and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,

and in a pliable and yielding Readiness to the Lord's Commandments, and in a patient enduring of Reproaches, of Injuries, Adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Oppressions: This is the Reason why the Word <hi>Poor</hi> is also translated <hi>Meek,</hi> for that which in <hi>Zac.</hi> ix 9. rendered <hi>Poor,</hi> is in <hi>Matt.</hi> xxi 5. declared <hi>Meek,</hi> an Evidence that these two Tempers agree in one.</p>
               <p>The Believers are poor because they are Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed and miserable, are subject to many Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Adversities, sometime with Spiritual, which straiten them in the inward Frame of their Souls, and make them very Fainthearted, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with bodily, which outwardly press them, especially Persecution and Bitterness of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: This is the Reason that of Christ's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is thus spoken, <hi>Zeph.</hi> iii 12. <hi>I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted People, and they shall trust in the Name of the LORD.</hi> This is spoken of the <hi>Jews</hi> that should believe in Christ. <hi>Zach.</hi> xi 11. <hi>And it was broken in that Day: And so the Poor of the Flock that waited upon me knew that it was the Word of the LORD.</hi> The Oppression and Poverty of Believers are put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Rev.</hi> ii 9. this is their Lot, <hi>Joh.</hi> xvi 33. This was seen in the first Times of Christendom. How have not the Believers been poor and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable by reason of the many Persecution? All these Things are found in those that are truly Poor.</p>

Poverty in general is <hi>a Want of such Things which a Man hath need of for Sustenance, by which he can subsist;</hi> so that the Poor in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral are such which have Want of Means to live, as necessary Food, Meat, Drink and Cloathing, by which the Body is defended against the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies of the Times, as Cold, Heat, Rain and Wind, So that they become necessitated with Anguish, Oppression and Trouble to seek their Sustenance before the Door of another. This is a miserable Condition; this <hi>David</hi> wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to his Enemies who rewarded him Evil for Good, <hi>that their Children be continually Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds, and beg, and seek their Bread out of their desolate Places, Ps,</hi> cix. 10.</p>
               <p>Poverty is twofold Carporal and Spiritual; the Corporal is here not excluded, for often both go together. The Believers ore often Poor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the World, their Lot is not always to have much of temperal things, because there is reserved for them other and better Riches; so that Poverty and Need is often their Portion. Riches are often Hinderances to follow <hi>JESUS,</hi> not onely because the Heart is generally too much set thereon, and cleaveth fast thereunto, but also that it is so loath when required with <hi>Moses</hi> to esteem the Disgrace of Christ above the Treasures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when many are called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto with the Rich young Man, <hi>to count those Things but dross and Dung for the Excellency of Christ,</hi> then they <hi>go away sorrowful,</hi> Matt. xix 22.

This was the Reason that Christ spoke that hard Word, <hi>Matt.</hi> xix 23, 34. It was likewise seen that the most part were poor that did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But because here is not chiefly spoken of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Poverty, we will enlarge no more upon it but treat of a Spiritual Poverty, as in Truth all Believers are Poor in Spirit that they might become fit Objects of God's Grace and Favour, and thus the Saviour discribes them, <hi>Matt.</hi> v 3. These Poor thenare such who are not onely made bare of all Spiritual Goods, for thus are all People by Nature: It is true, <hi>GOD hath created Man good and upright after his image,</hi> so that he was rich in God, in Knowledge, in Love and in Glory, overflowing with Spiritual Goods, but it did not last long that man continued in that State, he sinned and thus was bereaved of that Image of God, that precious Pearl, those dear Treasures, the Spiritual Raiment was taken from him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of those inestimable Riches: From hence we are all poor and made naked of those Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Goods, and are without Hope of eternal Life <hi>for all have sinned and come short of the Glory of God,</hi> Rom. iii 23. <hi>having the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing darkned, being alienated from the Life of God,</hi> Ep. iv 18. through Sin man is reduced to an Abyss of Want, in a terrible Condition and deep Poverty: And although all men are poor, they are notwithstanding not all <hi>poor in Spirit,</hi> for the most are like drunken People who suppose themselves <hi>Rich and encreased with Goods, and to have Need of nothing,</hi> Rev. iii 17. But these Poor are those who have Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:039964_0113_1015C8E29396E868"/>
of their Spiritual Want, who see and feel this in themselves, they are such,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Who have a quickning and convincing Sight of their Spiritual Want, Sin and deserved Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment and Inability, being sensible of their forlorn and damnable Condition in themselves, and of their Inability, to help themselves so that they can say with David, <hi>Ps.</hi> li. 3. <hi>For I acknowledge my Transgressions, and my Sin is ever before me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Who under this sense get a low, humble Frame, low and humble in their Mind, Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Conversation, having mean Thoughts of themselves, as the truly Poor always have, who do not look on themselves as if they were Something, but are made bare of all, find no Good in themselves, as that <hi>Publican, Luk.</hi> x.</p>
               <p n="3">3 They through all this are also driven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out themselves, become poor Beggars at the Throne of Grace, full of Desire to be filled out of the Fullness of <hi>JESUS,</hi> even as that poor one by the Way side, <hi>Lord Jesus have Mercy on me.</hi> And if they are poor in Body, they with Patience willingly bear it, and esteem it more highly than the Treasures of this World, they are contented with their own, and the Rest they wait for from God <hi>that Father of Lights, from whom cometh every good and perfect Gift from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, James</hi> i 17.</p>
               <p>Though they be rich in Earthly Goods, which may go together with Spiritual Poverty, they do

not set their Hope upon transitory Riches, they do not forget their Charity and Liberality.</p>
               <p>These are the Reasons why the People of JESUS, the Favourites of God, are called <hi>Poor.</hi> These are the Poor whereof Christ's Message was to <hi>John the Baptist, The Poor have the Gospel preached unto them, Matt.</hi> xi 5. And those whom he places as Objects of his Fvangelical Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>He hath sent me to preach the Gospel to the Poor, Luk.</hi> iv 18.</p>
               <p>Those who are thus <hi>poor and naked</hi> must needs be concerned about it, and have a sensible Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof: Therefore the Prophet likewise addeth, <hi>and of a contrite Spirit.</hi>

               <p>The original Word which is translated <hi>contrite,</hi> denotes, to beat, pound, bruise; from hence it's often translated <hi>Destruction,</hi> Ps. lxxxx. 3. to break and grind to Powder, according to, <hi>Js.</hi> xix 10. From whence it appears that it must be improperly understood: For the Soul being Spiritual, cannot properly be broken or bruised: This Word then is borrowed from hard Matter, the which with Strength must be broken

               <p>On the contrary, those who are <hi>poor and of a contrite Spirit, and tremble at God's Word</hi> may approach to the Lord's Table, such (1) who find themselves quite lost, feel their Sins as a Burden, and thereover have Sorrow, Shame and Dislike, and therefore desire to have an Interest in Christ, through him to obtain Forgiveness and also Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, to live holy and blameless. (2) Who from experience of their Misery and Defect take their Refuge to Jesus, seek out after him, long, cry, and give themselves over to him, accept of him to be justified in his Blood, and to be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his Spirit. (3) They that find in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a Hatred and Aversion to Sin, a grieving when they sin, and a constant rising and running to the Blood of Jesus for Reconciliation, have a Desire and love to live acceptably to the Lord, according to his Commands; such I say, that do in Truth experience this in them, and no other may come to the Lord's Supper.

And this Command went so far, that when the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> suffered but one Person that was unclean among them, to have Communion with them, although they were clean themselves, yea, although they did not know that such an unclean Person was among them, yet in the first Place all Israel were punished, as we see in the Example of <hi>Achan.

If the <hi>reformed Church</hi> learneth that none that are Unconverted may approach, but that the Ungodly must be kept off; what is then the Reason that this Sacrament is so lightly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to those who do but desire it, and have the Name of Members, although they are often <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I have administred the Holy Supper twice (now four times) and insisted upon this Truth, that no Unconverted may approach, and that the Ungodly must be debarr'd according to our Doctrine: But what murmurings has there not been about it?

Indeed thou must needs accuse thy self, and if thy Conscience was not past feeling, but did you once see and know what you have done, you would needs be terrified and fear the Wrath of God.

               <p>Well beloved Hearers, those of you who have so often been at the Lord's Supper, do you know that no one that is unconverted may approach Have you then deligently examined your selves if you were Regenerated? Have had an under standing Knowledge of these Things which were thereto required when you approached so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and well satisfied? Or did you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:039964_0154_1015C91A03E4AC70"/>
so blindfold to the same, not onely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Wedding Carment, but not so much as being troubled concerning it, not trying your selves whether you were of those who are invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Say you, <hi>I did not know that there was so much required thereto.</hi> But this you ought to have known, you ought at least to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood your Catechism. Is it so dangerous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the blessed Supper unworthily, for we sin dreadfully and incurr a terrible Judgment on our selves; how then is it possible that Satan can thus blind Men, so that they esteem this so light, and so little fear God's Judgments and so lightly snatch at a Food which instead of eternal Life might seal unto them eternal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? How is it possible to be so inconsiderate and prophane in such a great Matter?</p>
               <p>Hearers be no longer ignorant concerning this Truth, lay this to Heart: For if there be any Thing in the World, wherein we ought to act cautiously, it is here; let us then be cautious herein. <hi>He that loveth Danger is worthy to come into it,</hi> but no Danger greater than here. Here with one Morsel and with one Sup we can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane <hi>God's Covenant, and bring his Wrath over the whole Congregation,</hi> and make our selves guilty of temporal and eternal Punishment. Therefore call to mind this Truth and remember it, and know that although you may be civil and outwardly religious, and yet not born again, bare of spiritual Life, that you have no Right to
