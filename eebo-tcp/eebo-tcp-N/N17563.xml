            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>NEHEMIAH v. 19.</bibl>
               <q>Think upon me, my God, for good—according to all that I have done for this people.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words are the pious ejaculation of one of the firſt patriots whoſe life adorns the page of hiſtory. They are the overflowings of a heart deeply impreſſed with a ſenſe of his duty to God, and looking only to the Almighty for a reward for ſervices done to a people, who were become dear by the ties of blood, and the bands of religion. They are the devout addreſs of no leſs a perſonage than the truly illuſtrious Nehemiah, a favourite in the court of the king of Perſia, and cupbearer, an office of honour and profit among the eaſtern nations.</p>
            <p>A SHORT review of his hiſtory and virtues, will lead us to improve the text as the foundation of a diſcourſe, in which we may preſent the true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot only in the true chriſtian—portray his virtues as a pattern for all—and make thoſe obſervations which are proper upon the occaſion of our aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling together and worſhipping God on this day; and commending our country, our rulers, and ourſelves, to his guidance, and holy protection.</p>
            <p>NEHEMIAH ſhines diſtinguiſhed, for his anxious ſolicitude for his countrymen—for his liberality—
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:022747_0004_0FBA0F4BA0BD31F0"/>
diſintereſtedneſs—courage—uniformity of deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—and ſocial virtues; but, above all, for his piety.</p>
            <p>THE firſt of theſe immediately fired his ſoul to ſerve his friends and kindred, as ſoon as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the deſolate ſtate of Jeruſalem; and he could not ſuppreſs his anxiety, even in the royal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. The king, vigilant for the felicity of ſo noble and faithful an attendant, aſks the cauſe of his dejection. The anſwer is full and ſufficient—<hi>Why ſhould not my countenance be ſad, when the city, the place of my fathers' ſepulchres, lieth waſte, and the gates thereof are conſumed with fire?</hi> How unlike moſt of the world was this man! being in place and proſperity themſelves, they forget their beſt friends and deareſt relatives; they chooſe rather to riſe upon the ruin of all theſe, than to loſe the enjoyments of a gay court—the friendſhip of a chief magiſtrate—a ſplendid offi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>—lucrative poſt—and great wealth. Eſpecially are they greedy to preſerve theſe, where they have not the merit requiſite to gain them, as rewards for virtuous and noble actions.</p>
            <p>THE liberality of Nehemiah appeared upon all occaſions, particularly when he ſupported the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a governour, at a great expenſe, from his own privy purſe; refuſing to accept any reward from the nation—or even the ſum which had been paid to thoſe who had gone before him in that ſtation: nay, he proceeded farther—and, vigilant
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:022747_0005_0FBA0F4D4FDEAEE0"/>
over thoſe around him, reſtrained his attendants from committing any plunder or ſpoil, or doing any injury to the people.</p>
            <p>HIS courage was diſplayed, when he oppoſed and confronted Sanballat and Tobiah, who were exceedingly grieved when they heard that there was come a man to ſeek the welfare of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael; and when he ſtrengthened the people, by exhorting them to unite their hands in building the walls, that they might no longer be a reproach, and arming them and his ſervants:—So alſo he ſhowed a fearleſs temper, when he gave a reſolute anſwer to thoſe who would wiſh to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, that he meant to rebel, and ſet himſelf up for the ſovereign of the country—<hi>The God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will proſper us, therefore; we his ſervants will ariſe and build: but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jeruſalem.</hi> Hearing their ſcoffings—knowing their malice and ſecret plots, he ſet a watch—armed the labourers—and, like an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced general, gave out his military orders. But a worſe taſk, if poſſible, ſoon devolved upon him, and tried his valour; for amidſt all his cares and exertions, there aroſe a murmuring among his <hi>own</hi> people, and they and their wives cried to him againſt their brethren the Jews, who took the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of their diſtreſſes, and ſtrove to make themſelves fortunes by involving them in debt, for even the neceſſaries of life, and then gaining a mortgage on their property, to bring their ſons
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022747_0006_0FBA0F4EF2D66F50"/>
and their daughters into bondage—puſhing their oppreſſion to that extremity, as to put it totally out of their power to redeem themſelves, becauſe their lands and their vineyards were in the hands of other men: they had been transferred, ſo as to remove all poſſibility of extricating themſelves from their embarraſſments; leaving them noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but poverty, deſpair, and ſlavery, for the future portion of their lives. Nehemiah, ſtung to the ſoul at hearing of all theſe evils, ſoon reſolved what to do:—His honeſt heart, emboldened by a conſciouſneſs of having framed no laws that would ſcreen ſuch unbecoming conduct, and knowing that he had ſet a diametrically oppoſite example, encouraged him without delay to rebuke the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious oppreſſors, and oblige them to bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a covenant, to reſtore their unjuſt gains; and leſt they ſhould attempt to evade or protract this reformation, he called the prieſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> and in their preſence took an oath for the fulfilment, and ſhook his lap, and ſaid, <hi>So God ſhake out every man from his houſe, and from his labour, that performeth not this promiſe, even thus be he ſhaken out and emptied:</hi> and all the congregation reſponded, <hi>Amen,</hi> and praiſed the Lord—and the people did according to this promiſe. But, that demon Avarice could not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to be thus foiled; and theſe nobles of Judah entered into a ſecret correſpondence with Sanballat, his enemy, and aided his artful machinations againſt Nehemiah—they ſpread lies and falſe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and hired prophecies, wiſhing to terrify
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022747_0007_0FBA0F5154051388"/>
him by diſcovering his deſigns; nay, they had the effrontery to extol the good deeds of his enemies in his preſence; and in return, like genuine ſyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, they carried his anſwers to their miſchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous employers. But he paſſed firm and undaunted through all theſe—his big ſoul could not be ſhaken—his honeſt purpoſes could not be perverted:—And who, my brethren, has not ſeen ſuch conduct, and ſuch oppoſition ariſe, againſt almoſt every man, from the days of Nehemiah unto this hour, who has attempted to ſtem the torrent of vice, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion, and oppreſſion, and lead others to the performance of thoſe things which are right?</p>
            <p>HIS induſtry is ſeen, when he reconnoitres the walls and ruins, with a few faithful men, by night—in his appearing in perſon, exciting them to their work—in watching their enemies' motions—in putting them into a poſture of defence: <hi>We made our prayer to God,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and I ſet the people with their ſwords, their ſpears, and their bows; and I ſaid unto them, Be not afraid of them—remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your ſons and your daughters, your wives and your houſes.</hi> This induſtry alſo appeared in his attention to the reformation he made in the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned uſurious practices, and to a reeſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of religion. To find falſe and treacherous brethren among the Jews themſelves—to contend with men who were enliſted into the intereſt of foreigners—who were bribed into the ſervice of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022747_0008_0FBA0F55C52BF980"/>
idolatrous neighbours, and wiſhed to behold their city and country invaded, in order to give all poſſible interruption to Nehemiah and the people—was employment enough for one man to guard againſt: but he muſt be induſtrious indeed, who could repel the aſſaults of apoſtate prieſts and falſe prophets, with their frightful, enthuſiaſtick pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions—with their feigned reports of meditated deſtruction from the hands of conſpirators and aſſaſſins—with their attempts, by artful advice, to lead him to act the coward, to flee for ſhelter to the temple, or put himſelf there into a place of ſafety—and kindly, though treacherouſly, offering him their company. How excellent was the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of this firm faithful ruler, <hi>Should ſuch a man as I flee,</hi> (a man in publick ſtation) <hi>who is there that, being as I am, would go into the temple to ſave his life? I will not go in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HIS uniform deportment ſhone in all theſe caſes; no ſhiftings; no waverings from his purpoſes; no falſe pretences or deceitful excuſes, as popular paſſion, clamour, or frenzy—as ambition, avarice, or ſpleen, might lead. His eye was fixed upon the darling object of his heart; he abode twelve years by the work before he returned to Perſia; and coming to Judea again, he proceeded in the reformation he had begun, and returning a ſecond time, he probably devoted the remainder of his life to the ſervice of God and his people: all fair means were taken to recover the city from its ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022747_0009_0FBA0F56D5CE8118"/>
and he had the unſpeakable happineſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it filled with inhabitants—adorned—fortified—again diſtinguiſhed among the neighbouring nations—and reſtored in a good degree to its former ſplendour.</p>
            <p>HIS ſocial virtues appeared, in that benevolent love to his countrymen, which led him, without pecuniary reward or emolument, to begin and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his own perſon at the head of this noble work; in his reſpectful and grateful attention to the king his maſter; in his hoſpitality to thoſe whom he entertained daily at his table; in his ſympathy for the ſuffering women and children; and in his regard to the morals of the nation, by his attention to the reeſtabliſhment of their religion: nay, all theſe virtues, and every one of his noble acts, are in reality to be extolled, and can only entitle him to the applauſe of God, from his real, unfeigned, and ſingular piety—a piety, which ever led him, as in our text, to appeal to God in ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery emergency, and having accompliſhed all, to cry, <hi>Think upon me, my God, for good, and ſpare me according to the greatneſs of thy mercy.</hi> Moſt men would have been intoxicated with the ſucceſs, the applauſe, the honour, and affection, which he met with; and been puffed up, with the acclamations, and proofs of gratitude, which the world exhibited to him: but as what he did was for the ſervice of God and religion, he preferred the approbation of Heaven before that of men. Humbled under
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022747_0010_0FBA0F5899D622C0"/>
the love, power, and mercy of God, to ſinful man, he prays the great Creator and Preſerver of all, to accept his good intentions, and forgive his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. With the aſſiſtance of Ezra he cauſed the law of God to be read and publickly explained to the people, and directed them religiouſly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all its rites and precepts, and ordained a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn faſt to aſk the bleſſing of God. How pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were the ſenſations of this great man's ſoul, when he beheld, in conſequence of his exertions, ſynagogues built through the land, and publick worſhip attended every Sabbath day! From thence the nation ever afterwards maintained the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of religion, and were preſerved from idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atry.</p>

where ſimilar worth and virtues are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies that rouſe the voice of gratitude and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and lay honours and profit at their feet, and court and importune their acceptance—hung o'er with no empty titles, and dazzling by no borrowed luſtre—curſed by no injured innocent—dreaded by no defenceleſs citizen: ſuch will live, will riſe and proſper, wherever merit is a jewel, and virtue a pearl of great price; while its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, pride, inſolence, craft, duplicity, and inſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious ſmiles—while they would deceive and betray our credulity, that they may graſp us in their arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paw, and cruſh us with their devouring jaws—may make our lives, honour, and proſperity, their ſport and paſtime—are ſpurned from our preſence, and baniſhed forever from our confidence.</p>
            <p>NEHEMIAH is that noble character, in whom we ſee the likeneſs of the beloved Preſident of theſe States. Heaven has, in love, pointed them both to us, as patterns by which to regulate our actions, each in his ſphere, whether in ſtations that are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred or civil.

PERMIT me to congratulate every claſs of my hearers, and every individual in theſe States, that a Waſhington has obeyed their ſummons, by an united ſuffrage, and honoured us by his cares and ſervices. And while I do this, let me alſo ſtrive to perſuade my countrymen, when they contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate his character, to imitate the conduct of thoſe faithful followers of Nehemiah, who ſo ſtedfaſtly abode by the good work he was ſtriving to effect; and with warm, honeſt hearts, and cheerful voices, to echo their anſwer to his addreſs, by crying, <hi>Let us riſe up and build—perfect the temple of religion, and the edifice of liberty, which we have for a long time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared we wiſh to ſee properly founded, and their ſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures riſe into a fair and beautiful building, united by the ſtrongeſt ties of mutual affection and mutual intereſt: let us not, at this ſtage of our affairs, and in days of peace, continue inactive, or forget the work before us; but ſtrive to make civilization a bleſſing—to preſerve our national honour, by mitigating, as far as poſſible, the late diſtreſſes occaſioned by a long war—by reforming all diſſoluteneſs or laxneſs of morals, and propagating of our holy religion; yielding to none in our exertions on theſe heads—proving that we are thoſe patriots and chriſtians which we have profeſſed and ought to be.</hi> This is a work to which every man may contribute a ſhare—this is the errand for which we aſſemble in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, benevolent, and ſocial combinations—in our ſtate and national legiſlatures.

and call our civil rulers, of every kind, from their homes and retirements, unleſs we alſo combine in carrying into execution their juſt laws. And we ought to guard our actions, that in no particular we forfeit our honour as Americans—our rights as men—and, above all, our privileges as chriſtians It is a degeneracy of morals, which language can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſufficiently deſcribe, for us to be ſluggiſh, thoughtleſs, or ſelfiſh, who live in this age. It will be baſe indeed for us to forget our duty to God and man, by not ſtriving to fix the rights and liberties of men on this continent, upon the firm foundations of law and good morals. It would, pardon my repeating ſo painful a thought—it would be vile ingratitude in us, to the illuſtrious chief magiſtate of the Unitedſtates, ſhould we call him to publick ſtation—hail him welcome to the chair—lift up our voices of joy and gratitude for ſo auſpicious an event as his acceptance—ſalute and addreſs him from every quarter—and thus to neglect, in the ſmalleſt degree, to help forward his diſintereſted, induſtrious labours in our cauſe, and we ſhall become monuments of ingratitude, and objects of abhorrence to all eternity. We are to guard his honour, and our own, by ever ſelecting our wiſeſt and beſt men to be his fellow-helpers, in the organization of government. Piety, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, virtue, abilities, diſintereſtedneſs, firmneſs, are to be the requiſites to form his councils, and preſerve our freedom. If ſelfiſhneſs, if vices, if

And if pride, with its undermining art, with its inſolent followers ſtationed at every corner, and ſummoned at every ſound of his trumpet, may exert all its art to ſerve itſelf, to ſilence the voice of injured worth, and the ſuitor for juſtice, and thoſe who wiſh to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our national innocence and purity, we are going down in a broad road to deſtruction. We can all cry with Nehemiah, to an allſeeing God, and appeal to his mercy for time and eternity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have ſtrove to do our duty; and can honeſtly ſay, Think upon me, my God, for good, according as I have ſerved my generation, by thy will—and done good to my people: then muſt we flouriſh and continue to proſper.</p>
            <p>UNDER the fulleſt impreſſion of the importance of all theſe great truths and duties, I am author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed to obſerve, that in no perſon can we find ſo important a pattern to regulate our lives, to give our characters the finiſhing ſtrokes, and become as perfect as is poſſible for mortals to be, as in the great Author and Founder of our religion, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, our great Mediator and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate in heaven:—Nehemiah, and all the renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, that ancient or modern times ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, ſink as the ſtars before the bright luminary that rules the day, when the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſes with healing under his wings, to thoſe who fear God and keep his commandments. The great
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022747_0016_0FBA0F699BB333A8"/>
eternal Word, the Son of God, who came down from Heaven to ſave and reform a world lying in ſin, has diſplayed unto us a glorious pattern of pureſt benevolence—he hath opened a fountain, from which alone we can draw the pureſt draughts of that heavenly excellence. The ſight of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending calamities called forth his tears for his countrymen, tho he was to have no ſhare in them himſelf. His goſpel teaches us to love all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. His religion inculcates private friendſhip, and publick ſpirit—confining both within their due bounds—expanding our love, not to an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual or a nation, but to all mankind. We all ſprang from one common anceſtor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to teach us, that as we are all of one blood and one family, ſo we ought to live in peace and love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that ſeas and mountains are not to be viewed as limits to our affection for others. We are all partakers of one common nature, and the mutual benevolence this idea begets, inculcates alſo that we love our neighbour who is our image. In this love, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, the various ties which gratitude and blood join to the bands of ſociety; and we are to love our ſuperiours, inferiours, and equals, ſo as to preſerve a regard to the honour and felicity of others alſo. On this ground, we roſe above the narrow dirty ſhell of ſelfiſhneſs, and are led to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend our prayers and endeavours for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſalvation of all; and to watch againſt all unlawful incurſions upon others from art, pride, inſolence, and arbitrary power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:022747_0017_0FBA0F6B4F1582E0"/>
WE have one common country and kindred to provide for; and a little diſtance of place, or long abſence, are not to ſteel our hearts againſt ſeeking their advantage; and in no better way can we do them a benefit, than by eſtabliſhing order, protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing innocence, promoting virtuous exertions, and ſparing the diſtreſſed. If we permit immoralities to paſs unhurt, and bad examples to poiſon the hearts of others, nothing can compenſate for our folly. True religion makes the real patriot, and the fear of God forms the honeſt man, and if we confide only upon pretences to patriotiſm and honour, without perſonal virtue, experience clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proves, we ſhall be foiled in our wiſhes, and robbed of our rights, whenever ambition, luſt, pride, revenge, or private profit, lead another way. The piety of Moſes, Nehemiah, and others, preſerved their countrymen, when all other things were of no avail. The prayer of the righteous man availeth much. It is the extending and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of religion, in theſe ſtates, that is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged on all hands to be the only ſafeguard, and bulwark to our liberties. A ſimilarity of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, language, and laws, have ever availed much to ſpread peace and proſperity: and unleſs the firſt binds our hearts in love, and reſtrains our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly paſſions, we ſhall ever be expoſed to confuſion and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>umult. The preſervation of a religious, pure heart, is not leſs important; but becomes much more ſo, in a country where all religions are moſt juſtly tolerated, and ought and are promiſed to be
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:022747_0018_0FBA0F6CF6BAFC80"/>
protected; and all are to enjoy every advantage, which law can afford to preſerve, and whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors are each determined to defend and maintain their own privileges. Upon this head, the conduct of our civil rulers in every part of this continent, for many years, has been founded upon the pureſt juſtice, and moſt perfect policy, in not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting and guarding all from ſpoil and incurſions, but ſtriving to remove all cauſe of heartburnings, and jealouſies, by preferring one before another, either by an open or implied partiality; and while it is the duty, it is happy that it is the intereſt, of every one to preſerve it. Whilſt "the path of true piety is left without any political direction," and we profeſs to wiſh it to continue ſo, let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of infidelity and Laodicean indifference; and ſhow our gratitude to God and our country, and prove our love to religion and its profeſſors, by each living up to the rules and profeſſions of his own order; and the emulation be, who ſhall beſt know, defend, and practiſe the truth; reproving backſliders, falſe profeſſors, gainſayers, and other countries, for what we ſuppoſe to be defects in them, <hi>by our more pure doctrine, and more perfect life and converſation.</hi> If we do not prove that we are better men, better chriſtians, and more genuine patriots, than foreign profeſſors are, in vain have we exulted, and in vain wiſh to ſee them free alſo: if on the contrary, we abuſe our liberty to licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs, and an occaſion for ſin and uſeleſs inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, we have but promoted miſery to our ſpecies,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022747_0019_0FBA0F6F47B6FDA8"/>
and our zeal for others will be ſuſpected to ariſe from ſome evil paſſion within—or to ſpeak more plainly, if we wiſh to ſee teſt acts repealed abroad, and eccleſiaſtical power curtailed, let thoſe to whom our benevolent words and exertions are extended, ſee us living more ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, than they—religion more extenſively propagated by our exertions—and better ſupported and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended among ourſelves, than with them. Until we do this, they will retort the advice of the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as not inapplicable to us, <hi>Study to be quiet, and mind your own buſineſs:</hi> or ſay, <hi>Thou hypocrite, firſt remove the beam out of thine own eye, and then ſhalt thou ſee clearly to take the mote out of thy brother's eye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the deſire of encouraging the generous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of protecting all denominations of profeſſors, I attribute the honour done me in calling me to lead the devotions of this day—and to preach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this aſſembly. So ſingular a proof of chriſtian charity and polite attention, in beginning a more equal practice in Newengland, according to the opinion and wiſh of ſo large a part of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, demands my higheſt gratitude. It would, however, be arrogance in me, to aſſume this hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our as done to myſelf alone. I am happy to know, and proud to receive it, as a tribute of affection, and good will, to the communion of which I am a member. I declare, their united ſentiments—their principles—their words &amp; actions—demand, that I thank the honourable the Preſident and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature of this ſtate, for this mark of love, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022747_0020_0FBA0F73A20B60B8"/>
ſpecimen of generoſity: the firſt of its kind that has eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aſtern ſtates. And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while our communion are thus noticed, let me aſk the ſame tenderneſs and attention to our chriſtian brethren of every name. Good, pious, ſincere, learned men, are to be found in all communions. In every nation, he that feareth God and worketh righteouſneſs, is accepted of him. If God thus extends his care to all, let us not be inattentive to his will, nor appear to limit his mercies or our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours by any unneceſſary partialities; or debar them an equal opportunity to inculcate the great duties we owe each other. Morality and virtue are to be encouraged: and it is the glory and intereſt of theſe ſtates to cheriſh them in every perſon, and every ſhape. Our conduct ought to baniſh every idea of ſuperiority; leaving all, while they are good and peaceable ſubjects, to poſſeſs their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and privileges, without injury or diſtreſs, and to ſupport and propagate true religion, as is moſt agreeable to their conſciences.</p>
            <p>To help us in our exertions in ſpreading the bleſſings of religion, learning, and liberty, in this ſtate, we are happy to have a flouriſhing univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—endowed by publick aid, and by the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent contributions of <hi>all parties</hi>—by various grants and donations both at home and abroad, and by the aſſiſtance annually given in the ſums expended ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by ſtudents from <hi>all</hi> religious denominations. This, under the guidance of governours and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:022747_0021_0FBA0F74CC5374E0"/>
choſen impartially from all, will tend to preſerve equal liberty in our country—encourage private generoſity—and fairly, juſtly, and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, open the publick purſe; and the kind of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and foſtering care of every real patriot. And our academies, and inferiour ſchools, being placed upon the ſame proper and liberal foundation, will derive advantages to themſelves, and diffuſe exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive benefits to the community, which will ever be liable to be loſt by a contrary practice; and ſhould we ever be ſo unhappy as to give juſt cauſe of jealouſy and complaint upon this ſubject, which the firſt writers and advocates for the rights of men, both in our country and in Europe, have ſo often and ſo boldly taught and inculcated, with all poſſible zeal and eloquence; we muſt ſully our honour as a nation, our reputation as a ſtate, and our characters as chriſtians. Our youth are ever to be educated with the moſt generous ſentiments, and ought not, by the early prejudice of education, to be drawn to gain habits of thinking which may check the benevolent love and deſire to ſerve eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man—whether his colour, or his creed, accords with that of his own or not. Theſe youth, in due time, will take the reins in matters both ſacred and civil; and by a wrong bias may be deprived of advantages to themſelves, and prevented doing good to their common country, from influence in early life, that they may lament when too late; and blame the inattention of the influential, who did not ſee to it, that they had more enlarged ideas,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:022747_0022_0FBA0F767AD2A7A0"/>
and more generous ſentiments; and in conſequence behold themſelves deprived of thoſe pleaſing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, and perhaps thoſe honours and profits, that generally fall to the ſhare of the moſt liberally and univerſally inſtructed and informed. Should our colleges and ſchools in America become the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of religious party, very many of our citizens muſt be ſubjected to great inconveniences, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience real injuries and infringements upon their liberties. A conduct like this would be perverting the principles of the American revolution; it would be laying the charge of innocent blood upon the land, by any method whatever to oblige the ſons and deſcendants of thoſe who fought, bled and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the late war, to either remain in ignorance, or be driven to ſo painful an alternative as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an education where any thing inconſiſtent with equal liberty can affect them—where neglects, unfair advantages, the influence of inſtructors, may warp them from their own, their parents and guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians principles.</p>
            <p>ANY and every ſuperiority in matters of religion or education, leaves our patriots and their families and right to depend too much upon the precarious foundation of having them preſerved and defended by thoſe who fled from the very dangers in which their predeceſſors may have loſt their lives—or to which their cowardice, or ſelfiſhneſs, might have cauſed them to turn their backs: and making our heroes and ſtateſmen but tools to effect party pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and abſurdly fix ſhackles upon themſelves
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:022747_0023_0FBA0F7C0CFB22A8"/>
and their poſterity. Here a thouſand thoughts crowd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mind, and draw forth the wiſh, to ſee the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our youth more generally under the publick care than at preſent, that we may not tremble for any of them, leſt they loſe thoſe benefits in life, which their fathers pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with their deaths. Perſecution conſiſts in depriving us of any right or honeſt enjoyment in life becauſe of our religious tenets; and is found in the licentious tongue—in the aſſault upon the perſonal character—and in all the ſhapes in which men tyrannize over each other's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. It may be found as diſtreſſing to our felicity, and dangerous to our rights, in other things, as in the inquiſition of Spain and Portugal: and while we ſtrive to gain emancipation for ſlaves, we are to beware how we perſecute freemen. When at the cloſing ſcene of life—when all things appear real—a long ſeries of actions are to be reviewed; and amongſt others, we ſhall examine how we have performed our duty to our neighbours, and particularly our general duties to ſociety: how exquiſite muſt be the ſenſation of the real chriſtian and patriot, who has contributed to do good—to reform the manners—and preſerve men in a juſt regard to each other's felicity! He can call upon God, <hi>Think upon me, for good, according to all that I have done for this people:</hi> ſealing his will—his lips—and his life—with this ſentiment; as Nehemiah does his book.</p>
            <p>THIS day we ſee you, our civil fathers, collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon that all-important buſineſs, the attendance upon the civil and religious concerns of this people, in a thouſand forms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may God proſper your conſultations, for the promotion of his glory, and the good of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual in this ſtate. To be called <hi>fathers,</hi> is the moſt honourable epithet we can beſtow upon the benefactors of our ſpecies—and to be <hi>political fathers,</hi> is the endearing term which we truſt our rulers in theſe ſtates will ever conſider as the higheſt expreſſion of love and veneration, that can be paid to them by us, her citizens.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:022747_0024_0FBA0F7DCDC5CD78"/>
IN Nehemiah, I have depicted the leading traits in ſo important a character: he was a father indeed to the nation of the Jews—and was ever father more gratified by the ſucceſs of his labours and cares?—May ſimilar enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and honours be the ſhare of the beloved Preſident of this ſtate—of each of the members of this legiſlature—of every officer in this government—and of every one, who, in his ſphere as a perſon in ſacred, civil, or private life, is ſtriving to make our country proſperous.</p>
            <p>NEHEMIAH did not accompliſh his errand without pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly following God's own inſtituted mode, and calling in the aſſiſtance of Ezra, a miniſter and prophet of the Lord, and that of the prieſts:—and it is happy for us in this country, that a ſimilar aid is to be had from the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters of religion, and the teachers of virtue and morality, among chriſtians of every name. Their office, their pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, zeal, learning, and example, will gladly be afforded upon all occaſions, to enforce our duties to God and man, and eſpecially the neceſſity of obedience to the civil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate. With ſuch united ſtrength, the power of the people expreſſed by the acts of their repreſentatives, and the influence of religion diſplayed in the lives and doctrines of ſpiritual guides, we may look forward to happy times on earth, and for rewards and joys in Heaven. May we all, in our ſtations, remember and practiſe upon the precepts and examples of the great Founder of our religion, and Author of our ſalvation; and never forget to imitate Abraham, Moſes, Nehemiah, and the renowned of ancient and modern times, who have ſhone as fathers and benefactors in their day unto our race. But may we every day do ſomething for the good of others, and by our piety to God, obtain his applauſe at laſt, and ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, with patriarchs, proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, and apoſtles, in the kingdom of Heaven, enjoying the fulleſt draughts of love and benevolence, from God the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the God and Father of the ſpirits of all fleſh—hearing no voice, thro the boundleſs realms of being, but the voice of love; under whoſe meek but powerful influences, may all the kingdoms of the earth become the kingdoms of the Lord, and his Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now to the holy triune God, be aſcribed all honour, glory, might, majeſty, and dominion, forever and ever.</p>
