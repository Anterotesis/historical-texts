         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE former Volumes of our Hiſtory were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed under great diſadvantages. The firſt of them came out in the height of our war, when all the power of Britain was exerted to compel America to give up her moſt eſſential rights; while one ſect here were as earneſt to compel all others to ſubmit to their power in religious matters. How difficult then was it for a very imperfect man to give a juſt view of theſe affairs! And the many miſtakes of the printers rendered the work ſtill more obſcure. And though the Second Volume was better compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and more correctly printed, yet the laſt part of it was hurried through the preſs, ſo as to prevent its being finiſhed as I intended. Yet I know not of any public diſpute about the truth of facts in the Hiſtory. Many have privately diſcovered their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of the publication of them, becauſe their own ſchemes of power and gain were expoſed thereby.</p>
            <p>For the capital ſcheme of policy, for two centuries paſt, both in Europe and America, hath been to maintain a balance of power among the nations, and among religious ſects, ſo as to compel all to ſubmit to government. And a man of great knowledge in Pennſylvania, when he read my Firſt Volume, in 1779, ſaid in a letter to me "I think it needs not a ſpirit of prophecy to predict, that America is to be ſtained with the blood of the ſaints. I am afraid there is a foundation laid for it already. I wiſh it may not be with particular deſign. Formerly there was a proper balance of power between Epiſcopalians and Diſſenters, taken in England and America together; but now that balance is loſt. Formerly there was a
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:030011_0003_0FE3BCAE8B9F5398"/>check on the licentiouſneſs of power in America, by an appeal to the crown; but where ſhall the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Americans appeal now? Not to Congreſs, not to the united force of America: they diſclaim any ſuch right: they will be judges of no ſuch matters. They can then only appeal to their oppreſſors and accuſers." And he had the following reaſons for his fears: The American war began between Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians and Congregationaliſts, and the Preſbyterians joined with the latter, and they were the uppermoſt party in Pennſylvania through the war. And when the Warren Aſſociation ſent an agent to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, while the firſt Congreſs was ſetting there, in 1774, the members of it from the Maſſachuſetts plainly manifeſted that they would ſooner yield to the power of Britain, than they would give up their power of ſupporting Congregational miniſters by tax and compulſion. And Boſton, where the war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, was the only place in America where they had hanged men for religion. And an eminent man in Virginia ſays, "Several acts of the Virginia Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, of 1659, 1662 and 1693, had made it penal in parents to refuſe to have their children baptized; had prohibited the unlawful aſſembling of Quakers; had made it penal for any maſter of a veſſel to bring a Quaker into the State; had ordered thoſe already here, and ſuch as ſhould come thereafter, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned till they ſhould abjure the country; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a milder puniſhment for the firſt and ſecond return, but death for their third.—If no capital exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions took place here, as did in New-England, it was not owing to the moderation of the church, or ſpirit of the legiſlature, as may be inferred from the law itſelf; but to hiſtorical circumſtances which have not been handed down to us."<note n="*" place="bottom">Jefferſon's Notes on Virginia, p. 167.</note> Though the following things may alter his mind.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:030011_0004_0FE3BD00F3F3CE00"/>
1. The light of revelation hath ever enlarged the capacities of men beyond any other means in the world, ſo that wars among ſuch have been the moſt deſtructive of any upon earth. Half a million of men were ſlain in one day, in a battle between Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah and Iſrael. 2 Chron. xiii. 17. And we have no record of ſuch a ſlaughter in any other day ſince Adam fell. And the Quakers were ſo fierce againſt the teachers and rulers of the Maſſachuſetts, that they did not ſee how they could poſſibly keep up their religious government, without hanging ſome of them. Our firſt volume, p. 322—331. But the government of Virginia was in no ſuch danger from them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The firſt of thoſe laws in Virginia was made but juſt before Charles the Second came to the throne, who put a ſtop to thoſe bloody executions here; and no man has been hanged ſince for relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, in England or America.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Quakers hold that their children are born in their church, which, by a ſecret policy, has been upheld as one great body in Europe and America; and they held ſo much with Britain in the late war, that two of them were hanged, and others were ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed, by the government of Pennſylvania, as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to their country. But as the Baptiſts hold all religion to be perſonal, between God and individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and that all church power is in each particular church, it is impoſſible for them ever to form any great body, that can be dangerous to any civil gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. The Baptiſts and Quakers have therefore been unjuſtly ranked together, when their principles are oppoſite to each other. And when the church of Chriſt ſhall come to be governed wholly by his laws, independent of all the inventions of men, all ſectarian diſtinctions will ceaſe, and wars will come to an end. Though Europe and America are now ſo far from this, that ſectarian diſtinctions are often
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:030011_0005_0FE3BB10422C1B48"/>begun with capitals, while thoſe important names, Chriſtian and Chriſtianity, are begun with ſmall letters.</p>
            <p>And as I have met with ſome high claims of ſectarian power in 1783, that I had not ſeen when our Second Volume was publiſhed, I begin this in that year; and through the whole have compared actions and events with the word of God, according to the beſt light I could gain from every quarter. For as the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts have now determined not to reviſe their conſtitution of government, and they, with three other States, are conſtantly oppreſſing the Baptiſts, while they are uſing all their arts to entice all into the uſe of force to ſupport religious miniſters, there appears to be great need of holding up light againſt theſe evils.</p>
            <p>The liſt of Baptiſt churches in our ſouthern States, and of ſome in New-England, I have taken from Mr. John Aſplund's Regiſter, for 1794; but the moſt of them in New-England are taken from later accounts. As he was at Boſton when my liſt was printed, he prevailed with my friends there to inſert ſome names that I did not intend to have mentioned.</p>
            <p>This Volume was written with an expectation of cloſing it with 1795, but as it was not finiſhed till June, 1796, ſome things are added in this year. All the dates are ſet in old ſtyle, until the new took place, in 1752.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. WHEN peace was reſtored to America, ſhe entered upon ſuch a new ſtate of political exiſtence as no people were ever in before. All the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments among men that ever were before formed, were forced upon the people by a few powerful lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or elſe were given by immediate inſpiration from God. But the people in this land have framed their own governments, and elected their own rulers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inſpiration from Heaven, or violence from men. Though in doing theſe things, they have gone through great changes, which have diſcovered many
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030011_0009_0FE3BCB768C13270"/>of the corruptions of men, and of the infinite perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God. And a plain record thereof in New-England, eſpecially as to religious affairs, may be very ſerviceable to mankind. Inſtructive and uſeful hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> military, civil and political concerns, have been already publiſhed; but the ſtate of our churches ſince the war, hath been but ſlightly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Therefore an account of the ſtate of religion, and of the government of our churches, is here at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted. And as Connecticut hath ever elected her own rulers, and made her own laws, they have fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no new conſtitution of government ſince the rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution, but only altered their laws as they thought proper.</p>
               <p n="2">II. And to prepare the way for a new ſyſtem of laws, the preſident of their univerſity ſaid to their legiſlature, "Dominion is founded in property; and reſides where that is, whether in the hands of the few or many." And he held that the power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious miniſters is derived by an external ſucceſſion from the apoſtles, through the churches of Rome and England; and ſaid of New-England, "The induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the miniſters of the firſt churches was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by lay brethren, and this was called ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ſhould be conſidered what in reality it was, only induction or inſtalment of thoſe who were veſted with official power. Theſe were all ordained before by the biſhops in England." And he encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged them to go on in ſupporting ſuch miniſters by force, by ſaying, "God be thanked, the ſenatorial <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of this happieſt of all the United States, ſtill emboſoms ſo many Phinehaſes and Zerubbabels, ſo many religious patriots, the friends of Jeſus and his holy religion: And that the Meſſiah's cauſe is here accompanied with <hi>civil government</hi> and the <hi>prieſthood;</hi> alluſively the <hi>two olive trees upon the right of the candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick</hi> (the churches) <hi>and upon the left; the two golden branches, which through the two golden pipes,</hi> Moſes and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030011_0010_0FE3BD0E5E1562B0"/>Aaron, <hi>empty the golden oil out of themſelves,</hi> and diffuſe their ſalutary influence of order and happineſs through the community. Zech. iv. 11. As to nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal Chriſtianity, I have no doubt but that it will be uphold for ages in theſe States. Through the liberty enjoyed here, all religious ſects will grow up into large and reſpectable bodies. But the Congregation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Preſbyterian denomination, however hitherto deſpiſed, will, by the bleſſing of Heaven, continue to hold the greateſt figure in America, and, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the fruitleſs labours and exertions to proſelyte us to other communions, become more numerous than the whole collective body of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low proteſtants in Europe. The whole proſelytiſm of New-England in particular for ſixty or ſeventy years paſt, has not exceeded eight or ten thouſand, while our augment in that term, by <hi>natural increaſe,</hi> has been half a million."<note n="*" place="bottom">Election Sermon at Hartford, May 8, 1783.

               <p n="3">III. Theſe things were publiſhed by the higheſt authority in Connecticut, juſt after the news of peace arrived, and many were pleaſed therewith. But we would now deſire to aſk a few queſtions. And firſt, as it is eaſier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than it is for any who <hi>truſt in riches</hi> to enter into the kingdom of God, how can dominion be founded in property? Mark x. 24, 25. Yea, as all our American governments are founded in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and not in riches, how dangerous is the above teaching? And as our rulers have ſolemnly ſworn to renounce all foreign juriſdiction over us, how can they compel any to ſupport teachers who hold their power of office by ſucceſſion from Europe? And as perſons who are <hi>born again,</hi> are the only <hi>holy prieſthood</hi> that God hath under heaven, how can the prieſthood be conveyed by an external laying on of hands? 1 Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter i. 23. ii. 5, 9. And as the <hi>golden oil</hi> is the <hi>Spirit</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:030011_0011_0FE3BCBE55D33FF0"/>and <hi>grace</hi> of God, how can it be diffuſed through a community by the laws of men enforced by the ſword? Zech. iv. 6—12. For our Lord warns us to beware of the <hi>leaven of hypocriſy,</hi> which is cauſed by <hi>covetouſneſs;</hi> to avoid which he refuſed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in dividing of eſtates. Luke xii. 1—15. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could Peter give any countenance to the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Jews by <hi>nature,</hi> and ſinners of the Gentiles, without <hi>diſſimulation;</hi> and <hi>a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</hi> Gal. ii. 12—15. v. 9. The covenant of circumciſion made <hi>natural birth</hi> the firſt door into the church of Iſrael; and how can <hi>natural increaſe</hi> make any better churches now, than it did of the ſeed of Abraham, who were a <hi>generation of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> and had no right to baptiſm without perſonal repentance? Mat. iii. 6—10. And God ſays, If any man have not the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> he is none of his. Rom. viii. 9. How then can any man be a miniſter of Chriſt without his Spirit, let him be ordained by whom he may? God was the only law-giver to the church of Iſrael; and Phine has and Zerubbabel were no more than executors of the laws of God in that church. And he never allowed any to uſe force in the collection of the ſupport of his miniſters therein; but every man was to bring in the tithes and offerings which he required of them, as they would deſire his bleſſing, and to eſcape his awful curſe. Mal. iii. 7—12. Even ſo hath the Lord ordained, that they who preach the goſpel ſhould live of the goſpel. 1 Cor. ix. 14. And how great is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the goſpel of Chriſt, and the laws of men enforced by the ſword? Each man in Iſrael was to bring in all the offerings which God required, ſo as to be able to ſay to him, <hi>I have not tranſgreſſed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them.</hi> And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Moſes ſaid, Thou haſt avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his ſtatutes, and his commandments, and his
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030011_0012_0FE3BD1405E1EBA0"/>judgments, and to hearken unto his voice. And the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people as he hath promiſed thee, and that thou ſhouldeſt keep all <hi>his commandments:</hi> and to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in praiſe, and in name, and in honour, and that thou mayeſt be an holy people unto the Lord thy God, as he hath ſpoken. Deut. xxvi. 13, 17—19.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. A willing obedience to all the revealed will of God, and about his houſe and worſhip in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, was the way in which he made them high above all other nations, eſpecially in the days of David and Solomon; and they were no otherwiſe a holy people, than as they obeyed all his commandments, and as the viſible preſence of God was among them, in his tabernacle and temple. Yet the above preſident of the ſecond univerſity in America, took the laſt of theſe verſes for his text, and applied that promiſe of God to Iſrael, which they could only enjoy in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his laws, unto the people of America, and eſpecially to thoſe of the Congregational and Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian denomination, who ſupport their miniſters by the laws of men, enforced by the ſword. Yea, and the rulers who make and enforce thoſe laws, received their power from the people, who can take it away again at the next election, while ſaid miniſters hold their power by ſucceſſion from Europe, and that no men can ordain miniſters but miniſters who hold to ſuch a power; and when they have ordained them over a particular ſociety, that ſociety muſt be forced to ſupport them, until miniſters will releaſe them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. But if the people have given never ſo much for the ſettlement of a miniſter, he can leave them when he pleaſeth, if other miniſters will approve of it, and the people can have no recompenſe. Thus <hi>partiality</hi> is eſtabliſhed by law; and the root of it is the yoke which miniſters have laid upon children in
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030011_0013_0FE3BCC3609C82C0"/>their infancy. And to thoſe who looſe themſelves from that yoke, a noted miniſter in Connecticut ſaid,</p>
               <p n="5">V. "When you re-baptize thoſe in adult years, which we have baptized in their infancy, you and they jointly renounce that Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, whom we adore and worſhip, as the only living and true God, and on whom we depend for all our ſalvation."<note n="*" place="bottom">An addreſs to his anabaptiſt brethren. By Joſeph Huntington, D. D. 1783, p. 23.</note> And what greater evil can any men be accuſed of in this world? For they who ſecretly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed any away from the ſervice of the true God, were to die without mercy. Deut. xiii. 6—11. But they who were ſprinkled in infancy anſwered no conſcience towards God at all, neither did it produce any change in them, as all experience who have any right to baptiſm. For all who have a right to that ordinance, are firſt made dead to ſin, and alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Therefore we are <hi>buried</hi> with him by baptiſm into death; that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life. Rom. vi. 2—11. For as many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt. Gal. iii. 27. And this is done by the obedience of faith, and in no other way; and in vain do any accuſe ſuch of renouncing the only living and true God. But having ſuch teaching from their miniſters, a new law-book was publiſhed in Connecticut, in 1784, wherein, by one law, they gave all the ſocieties that were before conſtituted, all their meeting-houſes and miniſterial lands, with power to ſupport their min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters by tax and compulſion. And then they made another law, which ſays,</p>

               <p n="7">VII. The wiſdom of this world is here remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly diſcovered. And a miniſter who was born in Connecticut, has lately ſaid of their religion, "The beſt in the world, perhaps, for a republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As to the mode of exerciſing church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſcipline, it might not improperly be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a republican religion."<note n="*" place="bottom">Morſe's Geography, third edition, 1791, p. 109.</note> Yet it may be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to review the way by which it was introduced, and by which it grew up to its preſent height. Our fathers who planted Plymouth colony, held that the church of Chriſt was to be governed by his laws, <hi>independent</hi> of all the laws of men; and they never would ſupport religious miniſters by force ſo long as governor Bradford lived, which was thirty-ſeven years after they came to Plymouth. But, the next year after they came into the uſe of force for that purpoſe, two Quakers were hanged at Boſton. The <hi>congregational</hi> name was invented by the Maſſachuſetts, who held that the church ought to govern the world, and to force all to ſubmit to their power. And when that power was in great danger, partly by the increaſe of the Baptiſts among them, one of their greateſt miniſters ſaid, "It is made by learned and judicious writers, one of the undoubted rights of ſovereignty to determine what religion ſhall be publickly profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and exerciſed within their dominions. Why elſe do we in New-England that profeſs the doctrine of Calvin, yet practiſe the diſcipline of them called Independent, or Congregational churches, but becauſe the authority of the country is perſuaded that it is moſt agreeable to the mind of God?"<note n="†" place="bottom">Hubbard's Election Sermon at Boſton, May 3, 1676, p. 35.</note> But their charter was taken away eight years after, and in 1692 their ſecond charter took place, which gave the world a power above the church about religious
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030011_0017_0FE3BCC9A5725590"/>miniſters; though this was ſo odious in the eyes of many fathers in Boſton, that they procured a ſpecial act, the next winter, to exempt Boſton from the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el yoke that hath been laid upon the country ever ſince.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. The Preſbyterian and Congregational miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in England had formed a connexion together a little before, and the like was tried for in the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts ſoon after; but the writings of Mr. John Wiſe prevented it. But in the cloſe of 1707, a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter who came from the Maſſachuſetts, was elected governor of Connecticut, and he prevailed to carry that ſcheme. And it was done by bringing a bill into their legiſlature, who met May 13, 1708, which ſaid, "This aſſembly, from their own obſervation, and from the complaint of others, being ſenſible of the defects of the diſcipline of the churches of this government, ariſing from the want of a more explicit aſſerting the rules given for that end in the holy ſcriptures, from which would ariſe a firm eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment amongſt ourſelves, a good and regular iſſue in caſes ſubject to eccleſiaſtical diſcipline, glory to Chriſt our <hi>head,</hi> and edification to his members, hath ſeen fit to ordain and require, and it is by the author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the ſame ordained and required, that the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters of the churches in the ſeveral counties of this government, ſhall meet together at their reſpective county towns, with ſuch meſſengers as the churches to which they belong ſhall ſee cauſe to ſend with them, on the laſt Monday in June next, there to conſider and agree upon thoſe methods and rules for the management of eccleſiaſtical diſcipline which by them ſhall be judged agreeable and conformable to the word of God; and ſhall at the ſame meeting appoint two or more of their number to be their del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egates, who ſhall all meet together at Saybrook at the next commencement to be held there, where they ſhall compare the reſults of the miniſters of the ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030011_0018_0FE3BD2150F38210"/>counties, and out of, and from them draw a form of eccleſiaſtical diſcipline." Their college was then at Saybrook, which was afterwards removed to New-Haven. The miniſters met according to appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and drew up their ſcheme of diſcipline, which the legiſlature, who met October 14, 1708, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by law. It allows each church to elect her own officers, and to diſcipline her members; but if any perſon thinks that he is unjuſtly cenſured, he may appeal from the ſentence of the church to a conſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in each county, whoſe ſentence is to be final and deciſive, if the majority of the miniſters preſent are in the vote, and not without. Neither can any man obtain a meeting of the conſociation to hear his caſe, unleſs an aſſociation of miniſters adviſe them to meet. At the ſame time the miniſters in each county meet in aſſociation when they pleaſe, without any act of their churches, and claim the whole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of licenſing candidates for the miniſtry, and of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing churches whom to call to preach to them. And the miniſters in each county chooſe delegates out of their number, to meet once a year in a general aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation from each county in their government, to conſult about their affairs, and to complain to their legiſlature againſt any ſociety or perſon as they think proper.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. And when the Lord poured out his Spirit in a moſt glorious manner in 1741, under the miniſtry of travelling preachers, they complained of it to their legiſlature in October, who ordered a ſpecial conſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to meet upon it in November, and they declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be very <hi>diſorderly</hi> for any miniſter to preach in a pariſh where another was ſettled without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And in May, 1742, an act was paſſed by their legiſlature, to exclude all their ſettled miniſters from any benefit of their laws for his ſupport, who ſhould preach in any other pariſh without the conſent of the pariſh miniſter. And if any man who was not a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030011_0019_0FE3BB2EF851A5F8"/>miniſter, ſhould preach or exhort in matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in any pariſh againſt the conſent of the pariſh miniſter, he ſhould be impriſoned until he would give a bond of one hundred pounds not to do ſo any more; and if any miniſter from other colonies ſhould come and preach without ſuch conſent, he was to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by authority out of Connecticut government. And becauſe one of their ſettled miniſters preached two ſermons in a Baptiſt church, againſt the conſent of a Preſbyterian miniſter in the town, other miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters perſecuted him for five years, until they declared him to be depoſed from his office, and excluded from the communion of their churches, and ſaid they did it, "In the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word of God, and the powers inveſted in this conſociation, by the eccleſiaſtical conſtitution of this government." Our ſecond volume, p. 35, 36, 136—141, 181. Thus they held that the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was the head of the government of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, and that his laws and theirs were blended together; and is not this a part of myſtery Babylon? And they now ſay, "All perſons ſhall be taxed for the ſupport of the miniſtry and other charges of the ſociety wherein they dwell, who do not attend and help ſupport any other worſhip." And is not this a <hi>mark</hi> of the beaſt? for he is of a ſcarlet colour, and is very changeable. He was, and is not, and yet is. Rev. xiii. 17. xvii. 3, 5, 8. Blood hath ever fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the ſupport of worſhip by the ſword of the magiſtrate. But where the children of God and the children of the devil dwell in the field of the world, and appear to be ſuch by their fruits, our Lord ſays, Let both grow together until the harveſt. Mat. xiii. 30, 38. But in the church we are commanded to turn away from all men who have <hi>a form</hi> of godlineſs, but deny the power thereof, while we are required to hold faſt <hi>the form</hi> of ſound words, in faith and love which is in Chriſt Jeſus. And this he explains by
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030011_0020_0FE3BD270398DA48"/>ſaying, All ſcripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs; that the <hi>man of God</hi> may be <hi>perfect,</hi> throughly furniſhed unto all good works. 2 Tim. i. 13. iii. 5, 16, 17. The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reaſon why he allows the <hi>men of the world</hi> to make laws, and to enforce them with the ſword, is becauſe they will not obey the laws of God, nor refrain from injuring their neighbours, without ſuch forcible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints. And it is readily granted, that piety, religion and morality, are eſſentially neceſſary for the good order of civil ſociety, and ſo are the ſhowers and ſhines of heaven. But what a figure would any body of men make, if they ſhould enact laws to determine when the ſun ſhould ſhine, and how often the ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould fall! For the Lord God is a <hi>ſun</hi> and ſhield: the Lord will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. Pſalm lxxxiv. 11. For it is time to ſeek the Lord, till he come and <hi>rain</hi> righteouſneſs upon us. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea x. 12. Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of <hi>lights,</hi> with whom is no variableneſs, neither ſhadow of turning. Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth.—Pure religion and undefiled, before God and the Father, is this, To viſit the fatherleſs and widows in their affliction, and to keep himſelf <hi>unſpotted</hi> from the world. James i. 17—27. The beaſt is as <hi>ſpotted</hi> as a leopard, as cruel as a bear, and as terrible as a lion. Rev. xiii. 2. And how can any man keep himſelf unſpotted from the world, if he forceth the world to ſupport his worſhip?</p>
               <p n="10">X. As Congregational and Preſbyterian miniſters have done this, and hold to a ſucceſſive power to do it, which came through the church of Rome, a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter who was born in Connecticut, obtained the title of <hi>biſhop of Connecticut,</hi> in a more direct line than our miniſters have done. For he was ordained biſhop
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030011_0021_0FE3BCCEAA398E18"/>of Connecticut, by three biſhops in Scotland, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 14, 1784, who derived their ſucceſſion from three biſhops in England, who refuſed to ſwear alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to king William, after he had driven the popiſh king James from the throne. So that his line came directly from the church of Rome, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the government in Great-Britain for an hundred years paſt. And this biſhop holds that his authority came from Chriſt, as much as any can, and ſays, "A church in which Chriſt has no authority, cannot be his church: It may be the Pope's church, or Luther's church, or Calvin's church, or Weſley's church—but Chriſt's church it cannot be, unleſs it be founded on his authority and governed by his commiſſion. The apoſtles being divinely inſpired, and acting under the immediate direction of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, in all things neceſſary to the eſtabliſhment of the church according to the will of Chriſt, none of their ſucceſſors could have authority to <hi>change</hi> the government they had eſtabliſhed, unleſs they could plead the authority of Chriſt for the change, with as much certainty as the firſt apoſtles could for the original eſtabliſhment, and could give the ſame proof of divine inſpiration as thoſe apoſtles had given."<note n="*" place="bottom">Biſhop Seabury's Ordination Sermon at Portſmouth, New-Hamp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p n="11">XI. This is a moſt important truth; and where can we find that the apoſtles called any miniſters <hi>prieſts,</hi> in diſtinction from other brethren of the church? Until ſuch a word can be found in their writings, we may boldly reject all pretences to the Chriſtian prieſthood, in all men who give no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their being born again of the Spirit of God. And as ſoon as this man aſſumed the character of biſhop of Connecticut, it cauſed great concern in the church of Eng land; and a gentleman of great note therein, wrote a letter to a Baptiſt miniſter in New-England, to inform him that thoſe biſhops in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030011_0022_0FE3BD2C26331550"/>had not good authority to conſecrate others, and alſo that the people of Connecticut ought to elect their biſhop, before he could lawfully act as ſuch; and he deſired that ſome proper men might be ſent over to be ordained by biſhops in England. This letter was ſhown to many Epiſcopalians, and one of them in New-York took a copy of it, to lay before a convention of their miniſters, who were to meet at Philadelphia in September. But this affair lay ſo heavy upon the mind of the ſaid gentleman in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, that he wrote to Dr. Franklin upon it, October 29, 1785, and informed him that thoſe biſhops in Scotland had admitted "prayers for the dead, and extreme unction among them."<note n="*" place="bottom">

Though he has but about thirty ſocieties in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, and four in the State of Rhode-Iſland.

But as our rulers have ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſworn to renounce all foreign juriſdiction over America, how can they have a right to give public money to any who hold a commiſſion from Europe?

               <p n="12">XII. And as little of it appears among a new ſect which is now formed in America. For Mr. John Weſley, who was ordained a preſbyter of the church of England, with a ſolemn oath to obey and teach her articles of faith, and forms of worſhip; and yet he publiſhed a ſermon in 1739, againſt ſeveral of thoſe articles, and he preached againſt them in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030011_0023_0FE3BCD612FA42D8"/>Scotland and Ireland, for above forty years, and then he and his followers, ſeeing how the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can war ended, reduced their thirty-nine articles to twenty-four, with new forms of worſhip and order, and publiſhed them in London in 1784, and called them, <hi>The Sunday Service in North-America.</hi> Three orders of ordained officers are preſcribed therein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides preachers who are not ordained. And when they ordained the loweſt of the three, they ſay, "Will you reverently obey them to whom the charge and government over you is committed, following with a glad mind and will their godly admonitions! Anſwer, I will endeavour ſo to do, the Lord being my helper."<note n="*" place="bottom">Sunday Service, p. 283.</note> And many of his followers met a Baltimore in Maryland, December 27, 1784, and drew up a pamphlet, entitled, "A Form of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline for the Miniſters, Preachers, and Members of the Methodiſt Epiſcopal Church in America." They allow no man to be a preacher in their church, but ſuch as profeſs a belief that perfection is attainable in this life. They date the beginning of their ſocieties in America, from the labours of ſome preachers who came over from Ireland about the year 1764; and they ſay, "What may we reaſonably believe to be God's deſign in raiſing up the preachers called Meth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odiſts? Anſwer, To reform the continent, and ſpread ſcripture holineſs over theſe lands. As a proof here of, we have ſeen in the courſe of fifteen years a great work of God, from New-York through the Jerſeys, Pennſylvania, Maryland. Virginia, North and South-Carolina, even to Georgia." And they ſay, "We are thoroughly convinced, that the church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, to which we have been united, is deficient in ſeveral of the moſt important parts of Chriſtian diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; and that (a few miniſters and members ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) it has loſt the life and power of religion. We are not ignorant of the ſpirit and deſigns it has
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030011_0024_0FE3BD311D1AE998"/>ever diſcovered in Europe, of riſing to pre-eminence and worldly dignities by virtue of a national eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment, and by the moſt ſervile devotion to the will of temporal governors: and we fear, the ſame ſpirit will lead the ſame church in theſe United States (though altered in name) to ſimilar deſigns and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, if the number and ſtrength of its members will ever afford a probability of ſucceſs; and partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularly to obtain a national eſtabliſhment, which we cordially abhor as the bane of truth and holineſs, the greateſt impediment in the world to the progreſs of vital Chriſtianity.

And as the moſt excellent mode of church government, according to our matureſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is that of <hi>a moderate epiſcopacy;</hi> and as we are perſuaded, that <hi>the uninterrupted ſucceſſion of biſhops from the apoſtles,</hi> can be proved neither from ſcripture nor antiquity; we therefore have conſtituted our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into an <hi>epiſcopal church,</hi> under the direction of biſhops, elders, deacons, and preachers, according to the forms of ordination annexed to our prayer book, and the regulations laid down in this form of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline."<note n="*" place="bottom">Methodiſt Form of Diſcipline, printed at New-York, 1787, p. 1—6, 13, 30.</note> Thus they undertook to be law-givers for all North-America, and to form a church therein that never had any exiſtence until the year 1784. And their teachers have taken great pains to draw off peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from all other religious communities in our land, by confounding works and grace together. Mr. Weſley held that Chriſt died equally for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but that men are ſaved by their own faith and obedience, which yet they may fall from and periſh forever. And he ſays, "Unconditional election cannot appear, without the cloven foot of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

And is it not blaſphemy, for any to ſay, that God cannot elect, ſanctify and ſave a part of mankind, without putting unbelief, blindneſs and corruption into all the reſt? Yet Weſley and his followers inſiſt upon this with daring boldneſs.

And he denied that there was any word in the bible, that we could know by it that it meant without end, without other conſiderations than the word itſelf. And he ſays, "In what point of light ſoever we take a view of ſin, it is certainly, in its nature, a <hi>finite evil.</hi>—And the conſideration of hell as a <hi>purging fire,</hi> is that only which can make the matter ſit eaſy upon one's mind."<note n="*" place="bottom">Chauncy on Salvation for all Men, p. 319, 324. Dr. Jonathan Edwards publiſhed a full anſwer to him in 1790.</note> But if the holy ſcriptures have no word in them to diſtinguiſh certainly between a limited time, and endleſs contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance, it is the moſt imperfect book upon earth. And the fire of God's wrath in a future ſtate, is ſo far from being a purging fire, that he ſays, Behold, the day cometh that ſhall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, ſhall be ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and the day that cometh ſhall burn them up, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, that it ſhall leave them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name ſhall the Sun of righteouſneſs ariſe with heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his wings; and ye ſhall go forth, and grow up as calves of the ſtall. And ye ſhall tread down the wicked; for they ſhall be aſhes under the ſoles of your feet, in the day that I ſhall do this, ſaith the Lord of hoſts. Mal. iv. 1—3. Again he ſays, The hand of the Lord ſhall be known toward his ſervants, and his indignation toward his enemies. For, behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. For by fire and by his ſword will the Lord plead with all fleſh: and the ſlain of the Lord ſhall be many. And afterwards great numbers ſhall be converted, from all nations; and God ſays, As the new heavens, and the new

Iſaiah lxvi. 14—22. And if we compare theſe prophecies with the four laſt chapters in the Revelation, have we not reaſon to conclude, that the awful deſtructions among the nations, which God is now making by fire and ſword, are to uſher in the latter day glory? Yea, are not theſe the burnings which ſhall introduce the new heavens and new earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs? 2 Pet. iii. 12, 13. For the ſcoffers, walking after their own luſts, were never ſo open and daring againſt all religion before, in any age or country, as they are now in Europe and America. But the unlearned and unſtable, wreſt the ſcriptures unto their own deſtruction. 2 Pet. iii. 3, 4, 16. And one way in which this is done, is by putting earthly univerſities in the place of the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit of God, calling them <hi>rivers,</hi> the ſtreams whereof ſhall make glad the city of God. For he ſays, Bleſſed is the man that walketh not in the counſel of the ungodly, nor ſtandeth in the way of ſinners, nor ſitteth in the ſeat of the ſcornful; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night. And he ſhall be like a tree planted by the <hi>rivers</hi> of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his ſeaſon; and his leaf alſo ſhall not wither, and whatſoever he doth ſhall proſper. Pſalm i. 1—3 xvi. 4. And Jeſus ſaid, If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the ſcripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow <hi>rivers</hi> of living water. John vii. 37, 38. But how often have men put human learning in the place of ſaving faith in the Son of God!</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. The firſt univerſity in America is in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, where an early example of oppreſſion appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the war. A Baptiſt church was conſtituted in that town in 1781, and they had a paſtor ordained in 1783; yet they were all taxed for the ſupport of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030011_0028_0FE3BD3B51932158"/>Congregational miniſters, and three men were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned therefor in 1784. Therefore they ſued the aſſeſſors who taxed them, and their caſe was carried through their inferior and ſuperior courts in 1785, and was turned againſt the Baptiſts, which coſt them more than an hundred dollars. The conſtitution of our government reſtrained our rulers from making any certificate law, as they did in Connecticut, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſſenters from the ruling party might be exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from taxes to their worſhip; and if any perſons might draw off from them without acknowledging that they had power to bind and looſe in ſuch affairs, the uſe of force to ſupport religious miniſters would come to an end. Therefore a great lawyer informed thoſe oppreſſed people, that if they would give in certificates to the ruling ſect, that they belonged to ſaid Baptiſt ſociety, and would have their money go to the miniſter thereof, he might ſue the money out of the hands of thoſe who took it. This advice he founded upon the words in our conſtitution which ſay, "All monies paid by the ſubject to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of public worſhip, and of the public teachers aforeſaid, ſhall, if <hi>he</hi> require it, be uniformly applied to the ſupport of the public teacher or teachers of his own religious ſect or denomination, provided there be any on whoſe inſtructions he attends; oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwiſe it may be paid towards the ſupport of the teacher or teachers of the pariſh or precinct in which ſaid monies are raiſed." This article was drawn by another great lawyer; and men of that profeſſion are <hi>intereſted</hi> in ſupporting religious teachers by force as really as any men in the world; for a great part of their gains come by controverſies about religion; and when teachers and lawyers are in confederacy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they will make words to mean any thing which they pleaſe. And in the above article, they conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the word <hi>he</hi> to mean the teacher who was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the money, and not the man who paid it. And,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030011_0029_0FE3BCDE5636D038"/>rather than to ſuffer continually, thoſe Baptiſts in Cambridge complied with the advice of the lawyers, and their miniſter ſued the money out of the hands of their oppreſſors, from time to time, until they leſt off collecting ſuch money; and the like was done in various parts of the country. Our conſtitution ſays, "All men are born free and equal, and have certain natural, eſſential, and unalienable rights." And the right to receive and ſupport faithful teachers, and to refuſe to ſupport thoſe who are unfaithful, is one of the moſt eſſential rights of conſcience that can be named; yet this right is daily violated by all men who ſupport their teachers by tax and compulſion. Again, the Maſſachuſetts conſtitution ſays, "No ſubordination of any one ſect or denomination to another, ſhall ever be eſtabliſhed by law." Yet the Congregational denomination have conſtantly viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this article alſo. Though to hide it, they made a law in March, 1786, which confounded miniſterial and civil taxes together, and empowered every man in each town who pays two thirds more in one tax than a poll tax, to vote in ſuch affairs. And the act ſays, "The freeholders, and other inhabitants of each reſpective town, qualified as aforeſaid, at the annual meeting, for the choice of town officers, or at any other town meeting regularly warned, may grant and vote ſuch ſums of money as they ſhall judge neceſſary, for the ſettlement, maintenance and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the miniſtry, ſchools, the poor, and other nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary charges ariſing within the ſame town; to be aſſeſſed upon the polls and property within the ſame, as by law provided."</p>
               <p n="15">XV. Here is not the leaſt regard paid to the church of Chriſt; but fornicators, drunkards, rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and extortioners, have equal votes with the beſt men in the land, to determine who ſhall be guide for their ſouls, and how they ſhall be ſupported. And God ſays of antichriſtian teachers, They are of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030011_0030_0FE3BD3FE432B170"/>the world, therefore ſpeak they of the world, and the world heareth them. 1 John iv. 5. But how terrible were the effects of ſuch things? For the love of the world had induced many to run into debt, and it made others now fierce for calling in their debts, and collectors to get their taxes, which cauſed much buſineſs in courts, and a great increaſe of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers; therefore a man in Boſton began to publiſh eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays in their papers againſt lawyers, the ſame month in which the above law was made, which eſſays were collected into a pamphlet in July. And the people felt themſelves ſo much diſtreſſed, that, in Auguſt and September, they aroſe in arms againſt their courts, in the counties of Hampſhire, Berkſhire, Worceſter, Middleſex, and Briſtol. Hereupon the town of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton wrote to all the towns in the Maſſachuſetts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting them to bring in accounts of their grievances, and promiſing to uſe their influence in their favour. And the legiſlature was called together, and heard many complaints, and they publiſhed an addreſs to the people, November 14, 1786, in which they ſaid, "We feel in common with our neighbours the ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of money; but is not this ſcarcity owing to our own folly? At the cloſe of the war, there was no complaint of it: ſince that time, our fields have yielded their increaſe, and Heaven has ſhowered its bleſſings on us, in uncommon abundance. But are we not conſtrained to allow, that immenſe ſums have been expended for what is of no value, for the gew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaws imported from Europe, and the more pernicious produce of the Weſt-Indies; and the dread of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per currency impedes the circulation of what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains?— the difficulty in paying debts increaſed, As a diſregard to <hi>honeſty, juſtice</hi> and good <hi>faith,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See Matt. xxiii. 23.</note> in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and private tranſactions, became more manifeſt. Some perſons have artfully affected to make a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the government and the people, as
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030011_0031_0FE3BB2244213488"/>though their intereſts were different and even oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite; but we preſume, the good ſenſe of our conſtit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents will diſcern the deceit and falſity of theſe inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations. Within a few months the authority dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to us will ceaſe, and all citizens will be equally candidates in a future election." But all their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning could not quiet thoſe people; therefore an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was ſent up and ſubdued them by force. Though in the next election, the governor and above half the legiſlature were left out of office, and fourteen men, who had been condemned to be hanged for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, were all pardoned. And how came religious miniſters to have a higher power over the people, to force away money from them, than our governors or legiſlators have? Yea, higher than the kings of Great-Britain? For the miniſters who were formerly ſupported in the name of thoſe kings, and ſince in the name of this State, ſtill hold a power above them all. And are they not miniſters of the great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth? And the voice from heaven ſays, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. Rev. xvii. 18. xviii. 4.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">I. AS long as the <hi>fear</hi> of foreign dangers prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our Congreſs was wonderfully obeyed; but as that fear abated, the <hi>love</hi> of the honours, riches and pleaſures of this world weakened their authority, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they could not govern this great country. For while ſome States made laws to regulate trade, and to guard againſt foreign encroachments, other States took advantage to enrich themſelves. Theſe things were very diſtreſſing in theſe northern parts, while the people to the ſouthward were not benefited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. For Virginia had long received their religious teachers from Europe, as well as many civil mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; and Baptiſt miniſters had often been impriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned for preaching the goſpel without licenſe from Epiſcopalians, until the war put a ſtop to it. And after the war they tried hard to revive that power again. But the Baptiſts and others prevailed, in the beginning of 1786, to have a law made, which ſays, "That no man ſhall be compelled to frequent or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any religious worſhip, place or miniſtry whatſoev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor ſhall be enforced, reſtrained, moleſted, or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030011_0033_0FE3BB5C459E5AC0"/>in his body or goods, nor ſhall otherwiſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men ſhall be free to profeſs, and by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to maintain, their opinions in matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and that the ſame ſhall in no wife diminiſh, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities."<note n="*" place="bottom">Jefferſon's Notes on Virginia, p. 243.</note> Yet their houſes for worſhip, and their large tracts of miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial lands, were ſtill held by Epiſcopalians; and the frequent addreſſes of the Baptiſts to their legiſlature, for to have thoſe lands ſold for public uſes, or that they and their houſes for worſhip might be free for all ſuch miniſters as the people choſe, were diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. So hard is it for men to give up any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantage which they have obtained under the maſk of religion. The beaſt had feet like a bear. Rev. xiii. 2. And no bear ever graſped harder to hold his prey, than men now do to hold the power and gain which religious pretences have given them. Yet by a motion from Virginia, the Congreſs recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it to all theſe States, to elect delegates to meet at Philadelphia, in order to form a better plan of government than they then enjoyed. Accordingly twelve States met there by delegation, and laboured upon it for about four months, until they finiſhed a new conſtitution of government on September 17, 1787, and ſent it out to all theſe States, and ſome of them adopted it ſoon, while others did not receive it in two years. And if men find it to be ſo hard a matter to agree about the affairs of time, why ſhould they pretend to force all to unite in the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of eternity? If they differ ſo much about per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing things which are viſible, how can they unite in the ſervice of the inviſible Jehovah, who is beloved by his children, and is hated by the world? For ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery one that doth evil, <hi>hateth the light;</hi> and Jeſus ſays, <hi>I am the light of the world; but they hated me without a cauſe.</hi> John iii. 20. viii. 12. xv. 25. And
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030011_0034_0FE3BD4A9DA7E758"/>though this hatred hath been covered, in every age, under the name of religion or government, yet the feaſt of the goſpel, in the church of Chriſt, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the face of the covering caſt over all people, and the vail that is ſpread over all nations. Iſa. xxv. 6, 7. The Chriſtian nations have laid <hi>bands</hi> upon chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, before they could chooſe for themſelves, and have forced them to ſupport the national worſhip all their days. But God ſays to his people, Looſe thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the <hi>bands</hi> of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion. For thus ſaith the Lord, Ye have ſold yourſelves for nought, and ye ſhall be redeemed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>money.</hi>—Thy God reigneth. This is the <hi>goſpel of peace.</hi> Iſa. lii. 2, 3, 7. Rom. x. 15. And as ſurely as he reigneth above, no men below can have any right to make laws to bind any in religious affairs. But how hardly are men brought to give up this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over the conſciences of others! For on January 9, 1788, a convention of delegates from all parts of the Maſſachuſetts met at Boſton, and debated long upon the new conſtitution of government which was formed in Philadelphia, until they, with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, adopted it on February 6, by a majority of 187 votes, againſt 168.</p>
               <p n="2">II. One of the greateſt objections that was made againſt it, was, that no religious teſt was required therein, of any of the officers of government. But after much had been ſaid upon it, a Congregational miniſter aroſe and ſaid, "The great object of religion being God ſupreme, and the ſeat of religion in man being the heart or conſcience, that is, the reaſon God has given us, employed on our moral actions, in their moſt important conſequences, as related to the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of God, hence I infer, that God alone is the God of the conſcience, and conſequently, attempts to erect human tribunals for the conſciences of men, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious encroachments upon the prerogatives of God." But as this did not ſilence their objections on that
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030011_0035_0FE3BCE37451EBC0"/>head, a Baptiſt miniſter aroſe five days after, and ſaid, "Nothing is more evident, both in reaſon, and in the holy ſcriptures, than that religion is ever a matter between God and individuals; and therefore no man or men can impoſe any religious teſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out invading the eſſential prerogatives of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Miniſters firſt aſſumed this power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Chriſtian name; and then Conſtantine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the practice, when he adopted the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſtianity as an engine of State policy. And let the hiſtory of all nations be ſearched, from that day to this, and it will appear that the impoſing of religious teſts hath been the greateſt engine of tyranny in the world.—The covenant of circumciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion gave the ſeed of Abraham a right to deſtroy the inhabitants of Canaan, and to take their houſes, vineyards, and all their eſtates as their own; and alſo to buy and hold others as ſervants. And as Chriſtian privileges are much greater than thoſe of the Hebrews were, many have imagined that they had a right to ſeize upon the lands of the heathen, and to deſtroy or enſlave them as far as they could extend their power. And from thence the myſtery of iniquity carried many into the practice of making <hi>merchandiſe of ſlaves and ſouls of men.</hi>" But this was not ſuffered to be printed in the ſame paper in Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in which the ſpeech of the Congregational min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter was printed. Though the wiſdom which is from above, is without <hi>partiality,</hi> and without <hi>hypocriſy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. But men often carry theſe evils farther under the name of religion and government, than they can do in any other way. For if any are diſhoneſt in their private dealings, and refuſe to perform their prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſes, others can avoid having any further trading with them; but promiſes and oaths are frequently violated in public affairs, when the moſt upright can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring the guilty to juſtice, nor eſcape from being injured by ſuch men. A notable inſtance hereof
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030011_0036_0FE3BD4F8DFB3D28"/>now appeared in the State of Rhode-Iſland. A num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men therein artfully repreſented to the people, that if a large bank of paper money was made, they might eaſily pay off their public and private debts; and they were accordingly elected into their legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in 1786, and made ſuch a bank. Some relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious teachers were active in this ſcheme, by which the widow and the fatherleſs, with many others, were amazingly defrauded and oppreſſed. And in March, 1787, the men who were guilty of theſe evils, paſſed an act to cut off every man in the State from voting in their next election of rulers, until they had taken a new oath againſt bribery. By ſuch means they were elected again into office, and they would never allow a convention to be called in that State, to conſider of the new conſtitution of government for theſe United States, until the year 1790;<note n="*" place="bottom">It was adopted there, May 29, 1790.</note> ſince which thoſe <hi>deceitful men</hi> have been left out of office, and as great harmony is reſtored there as in other places. But in all parts of America the public promiſes of government are ſtill violated, beyond what men in private ſtations can poſſibly do to each other, and yet continue in power and credit. And no men have ſuffered more in theſe times, than relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious miniſters who have conſcientiouſly refuſed the uſe of force for their ſupport. And as our Lord ſays, My kingdom is not of this world, how can his miniſters have a right to force the world to ſupport them? How can they exhort rulers and people to venture their eternal all upon the truth of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, if themſelves refuſe to truſt it for their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral living? Can any wonder that careleſsneſs and infidelity prevail under ſuch conduct? But as long as rulers can force away money from the people, for the ſupport of religious teachers, it bribes them to exert all their influence in their favour; and this bribes rulers to continue in that practice; and God
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030011_0037_0FE3BB61A60546C0"/>ſays, A gift doth blind the eyes of the wiſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the words of the righteous. Deut. xvi. 19. From whence we may learn the cauſe, why ſo many wiſe and righteous men are enſnared in theſe ways. At the ſame time, if men can ſave their money by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the uſe of force to ſupport religious miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, many will uſe their liberty for an occaſion to the fleſh, and as a cloak of maliciouſneſs, which ſerves to prejudice others againſt the liberty of the goſpel.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The churches who formed the Warren Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, preſented many addreſſes to our rulers, and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the world, againſt oppreſſion, and for relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious liberty, from their firſt formation in 1767, to the cloſe of the war in 1783; and as long as the <hi>fear</hi> of ſuffering from others was powerful, it moved them to unite againſt their oppreſſors; but as that fear abated, the <hi>love</hi> of ſelf and of earthly things, has in ſome inſtances prevailed againſt ſolemn promiſes and obligations. So our Lord ſays, Woe unto the world becauſe of offences; for it muſt needs be that offences come, but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh. And he requires us to give each brother two opportunities to ſpeak for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, before the offence is told to the church, whoſe ſentence is to decide the caſe. Matt. xviii. 7—18. But where teachers are ſupported by force, all are accounted offenders who refuſe to have fellowſhip with that way. And many offences will ariſe among churches who have no ſuch exerciſe of power, which require more diſcretion and patience in dealing with offenders according to the laws of Chriſt, than moſt Chriſtians have attained unto. And when they have crouded matters into the church, without a due regard to his laws, they want a higher power to appeal to, than a particular church of Chriſt. To call in advice, where the accuſer and accuſed may be heard face to face, and ſuitable counſel be given for the church to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030011_0038_0FE3BD526C5FE4D0"/>act upon, is a practice which is warranted by ſcripture and reaſon; but a power in councils above particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar churches, has no foundation in ſcripture, and is an endleſs ſource of confuſion among Chriſtians. Of this we have had much experience. When the Warren Aſſociation met at Middleborough, Sept. 7, 1784, a miniſter who had cenſured ſome of his brethren, and refuſed to let them call in advice from other churches, came with a complaint againſt ſome who had gone to hear them without his conſent; but he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved therefor. Yet when the Aſſociation met at Wrentham, Sept. 13, 1785, he came with ſome que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which pointed to the ſame thing. And a man who had been excluded from another church, then came with an earneſt requeſt that the Aſſociation would interpoſe their influence in his favour; and becauſe they refuſed to do it, he publiſhed a bitter complaint in a Boſton news-paper. When they met at Newton, Sept. 12, 1786, a complaint of a diviſion in another church cauſed a conſiderable labour, and then a vote to leave them out of the Aſſociation, which is the fartheſt that they have a right to go in ſuch caſes. Their meeting at Chelmsford, Sept. 11, 1787, was not interrupted with ſuch things. Yet when they met at Sturbridge, Sept. 9, 1788, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was brought againſt the majority of another church, who had withdrawn from their miniſter and a part of their brethren, and the majority were left out of the Aſſociation, and the miniſter with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority were recommended as the church. But as this was going too far, ſo the effects have been very unhappy ever ſince. And when the Aſſociation met again at Sturbridge, Sept. 8, 1789, another miniſter made hard attempts to croud a complaint againſt a church into it; but it was kept out, though with difficulty, and he has been ſince diſowned by all our churches. And all experience hath ſhown, that a particular church of Chriſt is the higheſt judicature

And he ſays, Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them. Matt. xvii. 20. In all earthly governments, the laws are executed in the name of the ſupreme authority of it, which cannot ſee but a little of what is done in their name. But the Son of God is preſent in every church, as well as through the world, by his univerſal knowledge and power; and if any of his churches leave their firſt love, and will not repent, he removes the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick out of his place.

                  </gap>o the excellent Waſhington, upon his being choſen Preſident of theſe United States, dated Auguſt 8, 1789, in which they ſaid; "When the conſtitution firſt made its appearance in Virginia, we, as a ſociety, had unuſual ſtruggles of mind, fearing that the liberty of conſcience (dearer to us than property or life) was not ſufficiently ſecured. Perhaps our jealouſies were heightened, on account of the uſage we received in Virginia, under the regal government, when mobs, bonds, fines and priſons, were our frequent repaſt." Preſident Waſhington returned them an anſwer, wherein he ſaid, "If I could have entertained the ſlighteſt apprehenſion that the conſtitution framed in the convention where I had the honour to preſide, might poſſibly endanger the religious rights of any eccleſiaſtical ſociety, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly I would never have placed my ſignature to it." And he ſaid to thoſe Baptiſts, "While I recollect with ſatisfaction, that the religious ſociety of which you are members, have been, throughout America, uniformly and almoſt unanimouſly the firm friends of civil liberty, and the perſevering promoters of our glorious revolution, I cannot heſitate to believe, that
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030011_0040_0FE3BD584643F930"/>they will be the faithful ſupporters of a free, yet ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient general government."<note n="*" place="bottom">Leland's Virginia Chronicle, p. 47, 48.</note> And the next month the Congreſs propoſed a number of amendments to our federal conſtitution, one of which ſays, "Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſhall make no law, eſtabliſhing articles of faith, or a mode of worſhip, or prohibiting the free exerciſe of religion, or abridging the freedom of ſpeech, or of the preſs, or the right of the people peaceably to aſſemble, and to petition to the government for a redreſs of grievances." This was dated Sept. 23, 1789; but the Maſſachuſetts legiſlature were ſo far from adopting of it, that we cannot find any record of any debates upon it. When this State was ſince ſued, before the federal court at Philadelphia, our legiſlature was called together upon it, who inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our members in Congreſs to uſe all their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to procure an amendment of the conſtitution in that reſpect, and it was effected, and the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was readily adopted by the Maſſachuſetts legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature; but the amendment about liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is kept out of ſight. But in vain do they think to hide their iniquity from the eternal God, who is no reſpecter of perſons, but will reward every man according to his works. And the above teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in favour of the Baptiſts in general, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by experience, and by the nature of things. For where no perſon can be made a member of the church, without his own conſent, and each one can withdraw from it when he will, all cruel oppreſſion is excluded. And ſuch churches are not accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any over whom they have no power. Yet all the Baptiſts in Europe and America, have often been reproached with the <hi>madneſs</hi> of Munſter, in 1533, where they tried to ſupport their religion with the <hi>ſword.</hi> Though the parliament of England revolted from the Pope the ſame year, and ſet up their king as the head of the church. And all men who love
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030011_0041_0FE3BCEEABC9D2D8"/>the wages of unrighteouſneſs, are guilty of <hi>madneſs.</hi> 2. Peter ii. 15, 16. But they who are guilty of it, are commonly falſe accuſers of all who ſoberly refuſe to have fellowſhip with them therein. And the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is fulfilled, which ſays, I beheld another beaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he ſpake as a dragon, and he exerciſeth all the power of the firſt beaſt before him, and cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the earth, and them which dwell therein, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the firſt beaſt, whoſe deadly wound was healed. Rev. xiii. 11, 12. The two horns are, undoubtedly, the officers of church and ſtate, uniting their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſchemes of power and gain, under the name of religion and government. The ſword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, gave the firſt beaſt a deadly wound, when the pure doctrine of ſalvation by grace was proclaimed in the reformation. But that doctrine, and the government of the church of Chriſt by his holy laws, are as much oppoſed now by Proteſtants, as ever they were by the church of Rome. And how little do the people of New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland now act according to the high opinion that others have entertained of them? For an excellent author in South-Carolina, ſpeaking of the beginning of the war in 1775, ſays, "It was a fortunate cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance for the colonies that the royal army was poſted in New-England. The people of that north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern country have their paſſions more under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of reaſon and intereſt than in the ſouthern latitudes, where a warmer ſun excites a greater degree of iraſcibility. One raſh offenſive action, againſt the royal forces at that early period, though ſucceſsful, might have done great miſchief to the cauſe of America. It would have loſt them Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean friends, and weakened the diſpoſition of the other colonies to aſſiſt them.

And he alſo ſays, "It was one of the peculiarities of theſe new forms of government, that all religious eſtabliſhments were aboliſhed."<note n="*" place="bottom">Ramſay's Hiſtory of the American Revolution, vol.

               <p n="6">VI. For in January, 1790, a book was publiſhed in Boſton, entitled, "The Baptiſm of Jeſus Chriſt <hi>not</hi> to be imitated by Chriſtians." It was written by two miniſters in the county of Worceſter. Their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is, that John was a prieſt in the church of Iſrael, and that when he baptized Jeſus, he initiated him into the office of the prieſthood, to make atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſin, which none can do but the Son of God. And they ſay, "It will not be denied by any, that the words waſhing and baptiſm are of like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. —The baptiſm of Chriſt then muſt be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the fulfilment of the law of prieſtly conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." Yet as Aaron and his ſons were to waſh their hands and feet, theſe men ſay, "Is it not almoſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Chriſt was not plunged all over in water?"<note n="†" place="bottom">Eſſay of Fiſh and Crane, p. 8.20</note> Anſwer, Moſes was to bring Aaron and his ſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the door of the tabernacle, and to <hi>waſh</hi> them with water. This was done once by Moſes, at their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration. But Aaron and his ſons were to waſh their own hands and feet, from time to time. Exod. xxix. 4. xxx. 19, 21. Lev. viii. 6. In the firſt caſe there is no mention of hands and feet. Moſes waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them all over. But if waſhing their hands and feet was baptiſm, then Aaron and his ſons were <hi>ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts.</hi> Yea, and they baptized themſelves too, which is oppoſite to all ideas of goſpel baptiſm. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had John any right by the law of Moſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030011_0043_0FE3BCF200755710"/>Jeſus as a prieſt in the Hebrew church. For it is evident that our Lord ſprang out of Judah, of which tribe Moſes ſpake nothing concerning prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. And it is yet far more evident; for that after the ſimilitude of Melchizedek there ariſeth another prieſt, who is made, not after the law of a <hi>carnal</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, but after the power of an <hi>endleſs life.</hi> Yea, he is of an <hi>order</hi> above Abraham; and the prieſthood of Aaron is <hi>diſannulled.</hi> Heb. vii. 5—19. And his children ſay joyfully to him, Thou art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to take the book, and to open the ſeals thereof; for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy <hi>blood,</hi> out of every kindred, and tongue, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and nation; and haſt made us unto our God <hi>kings</hi> and <hi>prieſts,</hi> and we ſhall reign on the earth. Rev. v. 9, 10. So Peter ſays to all who are born again, Ye are a choſen generation, a <hi>royal prieſthood,</hi> an holy nation, a peculiar people. 1 Pet. ii. 9. By the death of Chriſt he diſannulled all claims to power by nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural birth, and united the great offices of prieſts and kings in his church, in thoſe who are born of the Spirit. Jeſus is the only law-giver for his church, and his children are the only executors thereof in his name. And God ſays, Beware leſt any man ſpoil you through philoſophy and vain <hi>deceit,</hi> after the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Chriſt. For in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily; and ye are <hi>complete</hi> in him, who is the HEAD of all principality and power. In whom alſo ye are circumciſed with the circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh, by the circumciſion of Chriſt; <hi>buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him in baptiſm,</hi> wherein alſo ye are riſen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raiſed him from the dead. Col. ii. 8—12. Yet philoſophy and vain deceit hath prevailed ſo long, that it is now denied that Chriſtians ſhould imitate the baptiſm of Chriſt, becauſe the ceremonial law was
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030011_0044_0FE3BD6175947610"/>not aboliſhed until his death. But the ſame men hold infant baptiſm from the covenant of circumciſion, which was the foundation of the national church of Iſrael. Yea, Mr. Fiſh, one of the authors of this book, publiſhed one before, in 1772, which he called <hi>Japheth dwelling in the tents of Shem,</hi> from Gen. ix. 27; in which he went back ten generations before Abraham, for a warrant for infant baptiſm. And their eſſay now, to prove that the baptiſm of Chriſt is not to be imitated by Chriſtians, hath been ſo pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the world, that it hath paſſed three editions.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. And the folly of men in other reſpects is daily expoſed. For the law in Connecticut, called, "An act for ſecuring the rights of conſcience in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion, to Chriſtians of every denomination in this State," proved to be ſo ineffectual to their purpoſe, that they made an addition thereto in May, 1791. By this addition no certificate could be <hi>legal,</hi> until it was approbated by two juſtices of the peace, or only by one if there was no more in the town where the diſſenter lived. Thus the civil authority in the uppermoſt religious party in their State, were to judge the conſciences of all men who diſſented from their worſhip. And when they had done it, the act ſays, "Which certificate, upon being lodged with the clerk of the eccleſiaſtical ſociety in which ſuch diſſenter dwells, ſhall thereafter, ſo long as he ſhall attend the public worſhip of the church or congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to which he has joined himſelf, and ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to pay ſuch his proportion, towards the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the public worſhip and miniſtry thereof, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt him from all civil obligation to the ſociety from which he diſſents, excepting taxes granted before the time ſuch certificate is lodged with the clerk of ſaid ſociety as aforeſaid." And this is a plain imitation of the Britiſh parliament, who reſolved in 1775, that they would not tax any colony in America, who ſhould raiſe as much money among themſelves for
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030011_0045_0FE3BCF7B2F9BE60"/>the ſupport of government, as the parliament judged that they ought to, as long as they did ſo, and no longer. But as God hath delivered us from that tyranny, how can any ſubmit to a like tyranny over the conſciences of men? For a freehold rated at fifty ſhillings, or forty pounds in the common liſt, gives every inhabitant in Connecticut the power of voting for their legiſlature, and of being elected into it. And all the privilege that their churches have, in the choice and ſupport of their miniſters, is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants may vote with the reſt of the congregation in theſe affairs, if they have not ſo much eſtate as is required of voters for rulers, and are twenty-one years of age. But a great part of their miniſters and churches readily receive perſons into their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, without any evidence of their being born again. And for one party of ſuch men to aſſume the power of judging the conſciences of all who diſſented from their worſhip, alarmed many in all parts of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, and they drew up a remonſtrance and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, in which they ſaid, "We cannot find that Jeſus Chriſt or his apoſtles ever gave orders to civil rulers to eſtabliſh the Chriſtian religion at large, much leſs one diſtinguiſhed denomination, who profeſs it, and uſe the civil law to ſupport its doctrines, forms or preachers; or that the ſubjects of Chriſt's kingdom (which is not of this world) ſhould acknowledge any ruler but Chriſt alone, in religious concerns. And we long to ſee religion left entirely in the hands of Chriſt, to be governed alone by his laws; that the grand controverſy may be decided, whether religion is ſuch an adjective that it cannot ſtand of itſelf, or ſo important that it will ſupport itſelf upon its own merits, and all who truſt in it." This produced a repeal of ſaid law, in October, 1791; though they then made another, to allow every man to give in his own certificate, if he diſſented from the ruling ſect.</p>

VIII. The uppermoſt party among Chriſtians have ever had the command of all colleges, to educate religious teachers, as well as other men of ſuperior learning, until very lately. Even in 1780, no min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters but <hi>Congregational</hi> miniſters were allowed to be overſeers of the univerſity at Cambridge, by the Maſſachuſetts conſtitution of government. And great ſums have been given to that univerſity by the government, from time to time, ever ſince it began in 1638. But as Providence and Rhode-Iſland colony was planted by men who were baniſhed from the Maſſachuſetts, becauſe they conſcientiouſly diſſented from the uſe of force in religious affairs, and that colony ſuffered amazingly from neighbour colonies for more than an hundred years, the people therein have grown up with great prejudices againſt colleges, and againſt obeying the laws of Chriſt for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his miniſters. But as a miniſter died this year, who hath done much towards removing thoſe prejudices, I ſhall give a conciſe account of the affair. Mr. Iſaac Eaton, who was paſtor of the Baptiſt church at Hopewell in New-Jerſey, from 1748 to 1772, ſet up a ſchool for the education of youth for the miniſtry, as well as for other callings, in 1756, and kept it for eleven years. One of his ſcholars was Mr. James Manning, who went from his ſchool to the college at Princeton, where he took his firſt degree in September, 1762. And as the Philadelphia Aſſociation were for erecting a college in Rhode-Iſland government, they fixed their eyes upon him as a proper leader in the affair. He therefore called in at Newport, on his voyage to Halifax, in July, 1763, and propoſed the matter to a number of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt gentlemen, who readily concurred therewith; and as they had a high opinion of a learned Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational miniſter among them, they deſired him to make a draught of a charter for a college in that gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, It was propoſed to take in ſome mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030011_0047_0FE3BCFBE79E6CF0"/>of the ſeveral denominations among them, but that the Baptiſts ſhould always be the majority of the corporation. He drew a charter which appeared to be upon this plan, and it was introduced into their legiſlature; but a Baptiſt gentleman diſcerned that there was a door left open for the Congregational denomination to become the majority hereafter. Therefore the charter was not then paſſed into a law; and when their legiſlature met again, the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was not to be found. When this was heard of at Philadelphia, two gentlemen were ſent from thence, who aſſiſted in drawing a new charter, which was eſtabliſhed by the legiſlature of Rhode-Iſland in February, 1764; and Mr. Manning removed to Warren in the ſummer following, to preach to a Baptiſt church newly formed there, and to begin the ſchool.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. In September, 1765, he was choſen preſident of the college, and diligently attended to the duties thereof, until ſeven young gentlemen took their firſt degree there, September 7, 1769. One of them was afterwards a member of Congreſs, and then a general in the American army, and laſtly a judge of the courts in our weſtern territory, where he died. Three of them are now uſeful Baptiſt miniſters. In February, 1770, the corporation concluded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the college to Providence, where a large brick houſe was erected for the purpoſe, entirely by perſonal generoſity; and education was well carried on there, until the Britiſh troops came to Newport in December, 1776, and our army came to Providence to oppoſe them, and uſed the college edifice as a barrack. After theſe obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were removed, preſident Manning engaged again in the work of education for a little while, and then ſaid edifice was ſeized, by the order of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of war, for a French hoſpital, on Lord's day, June 25, 1780, while Dr. Manning was gone to
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030011_0048_0FE3BD6A611515F0"/>preach in town, and they held it till May 27, 1782. And although no government upon earth ever gave any thing towards that building, yet no recompenſe has ever been obtained for the great damages which were done to it by government.<note n="*" place="bottom">Though there is ſome hope of it ſoon from Congreſs.</note> However, preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Manning, being encouraged by the friends of the college, heartily engaged again in his public work, and learning flouriſhed under his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Baptiſt church in Providence enjoyed many bleſſings under his miniſtry, until he was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly called out of our world, July 29, 1791, in the 53d year of his age. He was ſo well eſteemed in the government, that he was elected a delegate to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the ſpring of 1786, which office he accepted for ſix months, in hopes of obtaining a grant from thence to indemnify the college at Providence. But though he was highly eſteemed in that honourable body, yet it was then out of their power to do juſtice in this caſe, as well as many others. Neither could preſident Manning obtain the whole of his ſalary for many years, which was to be paid out of the intereſt of money that was collected elſewhere, and was lent to Rhode-Iſland government. His perſeverance, therefore, in the midſt of ſo many difficulties, and his riſing above them all in faithfulneſs and kindneſs, will endear his memory to the lateſt poſterity. And theſe things demonſtrate to all men, that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of believers' baptiſm, and of equal liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, are more friendly to true learning and knowledge, than any party ſchemes of religion ever were, or ever can be. For all loving of ſelf above God and our neighbours, though covered with a maſk of religion or government, can never make the ſubjects of it willing to have their real character ſeen.</p>
               <p n="10">X. And how is this love of ſelf now expoſed in our country? For the firſt Congreſs upon our new conſtitution met in March, 1789, and made laws
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:030011_0049_0FE3BD6FF2E08170"/>to regulate the trade of America, which revived public credit, and the merchandiſe of this country was carried round the world. Alſo the creditors of government were encouraged to bring in their notes to the loan offices that were appointed in each State, where the intereſt of ſaid notes was caſt up to the cloſe of 1791; after which new notes were given out, of three denominations. The firſt were to carry the intereſt which was formerly promiſed, the ſecond but half ſo much, and the third were to pay no intereſt at all for ten years. But who would truſt any ſingle man in the world, if he ſhould act in this manner? Surely no man upon earth could obtain credit and eſteem in ſuch a way. And our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who requires the goſpel miniſtry to be committed to <hi>faithful men,</hi> ſays, If we be dead with him, we ſhall alſo live with him; if we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reign with him: if we deny him, he alſo will deny us: if we believe not, yet he <hi>abideth faithful; he cannot deny himſelf.</hi> 2 Tim. ii. 2—13. This is the only line of ſucceſſion for his miniſters. But deceitful men in every ſtation imagine that the ſecurity of a whole government is ſo much ſtronger than the promiſes of individuals, that they ſay, Caſt in thy lot among us, let us all have one purſe.—Their feet run to evil, and make haſte to ſhed <hi>blood.</hi> This God ſays of <hi>all the world.</hi> Prov. i. 14, 16. Rom. iii. 15, 19. How vain then are all the arguments which are advanced againſt the univerſal depravity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? Yea, or againſt the power of God in chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart, who ſays, Turn ye at my reproof; behold I will pour out my <hi>Spirit</hi> unto you, and will make known my <hi>words</hi> unto you? But all men who <hi>hate knowledge,</hi> and will not chooſe the <hi>fear</hi> of the Lord in this life, will cry in vain for mercy, when deſtruction cometh as a whirlwind. Prov. i. 23—29.

                  </gap>nding ſyſtems eſtabliſhed by govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as ſupporting religious teachers by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030011_0050_0FE3BDDA2F8C0328"/>have been productive of oppreſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice; and Jehovah ſays, Hear ye that are far off what I have done; and ye that are near, acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge my might. The ſinners in Zion are afraid, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs hath ſurpriſed the hypocrites: who among us ſhall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings? He that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth righteouſly, and ſpeaketh uprightly, he that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſeth the gain of oppreſſions, that ſhaketh his hands from holding of <hi>bribes,</hi> that ſtoppeth his ears from hearing of <hi>blood,</hi> and ſhutteth his eyes from ſeeing evil. Iſaiah xxxiii. 13—15. This is the only way of ſafety and happineſs. But how oppoſite hereto were the following actions?</p>
               <p n="11">XI. A Baptiſt church was formed in Barnſtable in June, 1771, and when they had given in certificates to the ruling ſect, they were generally exempted from taxes to their miniſters for ten years. But a freſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival of religion came on among them in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of 1781, and increaſed their church and ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, until they built a convenient meeting-houſe, and then ordained a paſtor, December 4, 1788. He had preached to them for four years before he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, yet in that time, with three years after, above an hundred and fifty dollars were extorted from that ſociety, for the Congregational miniſters of the firſt pariſhes in Barnſtable and Yarmouth. In January, 1790, a collector in Barnſtable took away a good horſe from one of the committee of that Baptiſt ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, for a miniſterial tax of leſs than two dollars; and though he offered to return a ſmall part of the value of the horſe, yet the Baptiſt gentleman refuſed to receive it, and ſo to have fellowſhip with their works of darkneſs. But thoſe cruel oppreſſions were purſued, until the committee of the Warren Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion met at Boſton, January 24, 1791, and wrote to the officers of thoſe two pariſhes in ſuch a manner, that they have generally refrained from taxing the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030011_0051_0FE3BD74D2782E10"/>Baptiſts to Congregational miniſters ſince, though they have not returned the money which they had before unjuſtly taken from them. The weſt pariſh in Barnſtable, and many others through the country, have not made diſtreſs upon the Baptiſts for the ſupport of pariſh miniſters, as theſe have done. And our ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers give Baptiſt miniſters the ſame power to marry people, and to be exempted from civil taxes, that they do to other miniſters. But they have not yet gone ſo far as a king of Perſia did, who gave liberally for the houſe of God out of his own treaſures, and exempted the miniſters of the ſanctuary from civil taxes, without impoſing any miniſterial tax upon the people. Ezra vii. 11—24. And we have no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that God ever allowed any rulers in Iſrael to uſe any ſecular force for the ſupport of his prieſts in their church; but when two prieſts ſent their ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants to the people with this language, Thou ſhalt give it now; and if not, I will take it by <hi>force,</hi> they were both ſlain in one day, and their father's neck was broke. For God had ſaid, Them that honour me, I will honour, and they that deſpiſe me ſhall be lightly eſteemed. 1 Sam. ii. 16, 30. iv. 11, 18. And how far are teachers from honouring our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, if they refuſe to be content with all the good things that his laws and influence will give them!</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Impriſonments and ſpoiling of goods, for the ſupport of Congregational miniſters in Rehoboth, for thirty years, had brought that ſect to be the minor part of the inhabitants of the town; therefore they obtained liberty to ſell their miniſterial lands, and an act of our legiſlature in 1762, to incorporate the committee who ſhould be annually elected in each pariſh, to manage that fund of money, and what ſhould be added to it by ſubſcription, ſo that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt thereof might ſupport their miniſters. And it was ſuppoſed that as long as this act continued in force, they had no right to tax all the inhabitants to
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030011_0052_0FE3BDDECEEC4830"/>them, as they had before done. And this appeared the more neceſſary, becauſe Mr. Samuel Peck was ordained the paſtor of a Congregational church in Rehoboth, October 8, 1751, who refuſed to have any fellowſhip with thoſe who uſed tax and compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in that affair; and he miniſtered to them until he died, November 26, 1788, Aet. 82. But the ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our public credit, and other means, brought their fund of money in the firſt pariſh in Rehoboth down to leſs than ſix hundred pounds; and as Mr. John Ellis was inſtalled their miniſter in March, 1785, with a promiſe of a ſalary of an hundred pounds a year, they ventured to tax all the inhabitants to pay it, though he was not elected by a third part of them. And as they paid but little more than the ſalary of one year in five, he ſued the pariſh for the reſt, and recovered judgment againſt them in March, 1791. But they appealed to the ſuperior court in October following; and they called a pariſh meeting in Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, and offered the uſe of their meeting-houſe, and of their fund of money to Mr. Ellis's party, as long as he continued their miniſter, if they would pay off that debt, and ſupport him, without taxing any who did not chooſe him; and adjourned for three weeks. But as this offer was not accepted at their next meeting, fifty voters againſt fourteen voted to ſhut him out of their meeting-houſe, and choſe a ſpecial committee to get Baptiſt miniſters to preach therein. And as they had not got any Baptiſt min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter to preach in it the firſt Lord's day after he was ſhut out, he came and demanded it to be opened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore two juſtices of the peace; and becauſe it was not opened, they publiſhed an account of it in the Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence news-papers, and called the men <hi>inſurgents</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">A name given to thoſe who reſiſted our courts in 1786.</note> who ſhut him out. The next Lord's day, while a Baptiſt miniſter was in the pulpit, he came and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted the public worſhip of God; but he was
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030011_0053_0FE3BD7855948940"/>brought before a juſtice of peace therefor, and bound to his good behaviour till the next March court, and Baptiſt miniſters preached in ſaid houſe all that time. In March he, with difficulty, obtained a releaſe from thoſe bonds, though he could not recover his former place of worſhip. Therefore his party applied to our legiſlature in June, 1792, and obtained a repeal of the act of 1762, which inveſted their pariſh commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee with power to manage their fund of money, and an act to incorporate his party as the Congregational ſociety in the firſt precinct in Rehoboth. But as they did not obtain the meeting-houſe nor fund of money thereby, they called a ſpecial court for that purpoſe, Auguſt 30, 1792; yet judgment was th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Afterwards Ellis's party called another ſpecial court, who gave them poſſeſſion of ſaid houſe.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. Now can any man believe, that ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings as theſe have any tendency to promote piety, religion or morality? Yea, are they not as contrary thereto as darkneſs is to light? And theſe are the natural effects of ſupporting religious miniſters by force. Neither would that little party at Rehoboth have been able to go ſo far as they have done, if rulers and miniſters in general had not viewed it as their own cauſe. For if one congregation can ſhut their miniſter out of their meeting-houſe when they think proper, another may alſo, and ſupporting wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by force will be excluded from our land. And though many have reflected on the Baptiſts, becauſe that ſociety in Rehoboth called them in to aſſiſt in their worſhip, and to exclude oppreſſors; yet the firſt pariſhes in Rocheſter and Wrentham have ſhut their miniſters alſo out of their meeting-houſes, without
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030011_0054_0FE3BDE3ABC96960"/>any concern with the Baptiſts therein. And it daily appears, that the ruling party in our land, as well as through the world, are trying to graſp the honours and profits of religion to themſelves, while they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the <hi>power of godlineſs.</hi> And the doctrines of grace, and the order of the firſt churches in New-England, are trampled upon through the country. Of this we have a notable inſtance in the town of Taunton, the capital of Briſtol county. As a number of lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men in that town diſliked the preaching of their miniſter, they informed the pariſh that they had no right to vote him any ſalary, becauſe they were the minor part of the inhabitants of the town; and, after ſeveral meetings, a council was called, and he was diſmiſſed, near the cloſe of 1790. After which they obtained an incorporation as the Congregational ſociety in Taunton, with power to ſettle and ſupport miniſters by tax and compulſion; only if any man therein deſired to withdraw from them, he might go to their clerk at the end of the year, and get his name out of the liſt, and be free from them for the future. But any number of men can form a ſtronger ſociety than this, without putting our government to ſuch vaſt coſts as have been laid upon us in ſuch affairs. And it ſoon appeared, that ſaid ſociety and the firſt Congregational church in Taunton could not agree in calling another miniſter; therefore another church was formed, in open <hi>ſeparation</hi> from the firſt church in Taunton, and they called a miniſter who was ſo diſagreeable to the firſt church, that they went and built another meeting-houſe, and called another min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter to preach to them. But the new party ſent for two miniſters out of Boſton, and obtained ten more from various parts of the country, to give a ſanction to their proceedings. And in a Boſton paper of May 25. 1792, it was ſaid, "Wedneſday, the 16th inſtant, the Rev. John Foſter was inſtalled to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral care of the firſt Congregational church and ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030011_0055_0FE3BD7DAEFE4600"/>in Taunton." And the ſame was declared in a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence paper; though the church in which he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled was conſtituted that year, and the ſociety the year before. And was not this <hi>lying</hi> in religious affairs? And in the winter following a church was formed in Pomfret in Connecticut, and a miniſter was ordained therein, in open ſeparation from the firſt church in that town.</p>

And the author ſays, "It is the will of God that many be admitted into the church who are not in <hi>heart</hi> friends to him. And if the greater part be of this character, can we imagine that the true intereſts of Chriſt's kingdom are in any danger, while Chriſt has his <hi>enemies</hi> as much in his power as any, and can uſe them as his inſtruments, or reſtrain them, or make them his willing people, or cut them off, whenever he pleaſes?"<note n="†" place="bottom">Hemmenway's Diſcourſe concerning the church, p. 50.</note> It is readily granted that Chriſt has all the world under his power, but his revealed will requires a profeſſion of ſaving faith of all who are received into his church; and they who imagine that he allows his <hi>enemies</hi> to come into it, implicitly put him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath all rational men.

Now the principles of repentance from dead works, of faith in the Son of God, of reſurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment, were never known by men but by pure revelation from God; and the ſame is true of regeneration, and of juſtification by our ſins being laid upon Chriſt our ſacrifice.

But the holding to an external laying on of hands upon officers, as a foundation point in miniſterial authority, hath made them lords over God's heritage, in every age, and in every country where the Chriſtian name hath been known. And holding to the laying on of hands upon every member, after baptiſm, hath cauſed great diviſions among the Baptiſts, which ſhould put all upon examination of this point. Laying on of hands upon officers in ordination, is no more than a ſolemn ſwearing of them to be faithful in their work, and civil rulers are alſo inducted into their offices by an oath, after the people have given them their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which they can take away again at appointed times. And this was the original plan of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational churches in New-England; only none were allowed to give miniſters their power, but thoſe who were judged to be real Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. The firſt church in Dorcheſter, with Mr. Wareham their miniſter, removed up to Windſor, and began the colony of Connecticut, in 1635, in which year Mr. Richard Mather came over to Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter. And on April 11, 1636, a meeting was held there for the purpoſe of gathering a new church; but it was not then done, becauſe the rulers and miniſters preſent were not ſatisfied with the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the moſt of the perſons who were to be of the church. "Moſt of them had burdened their comfort of ſalvation upon unſound grounds, viz. Some upon dreams and raviſhes of ſpirit by fits; others upon the reformation of their lives; others upon duties and performances, &amp;c. wherein they diſcovered three ſpecial errors. 1. That they had not come to hate ſin becauſe it was filthy, but only left it becauſe it was hurtful. 2. That by reaſon of
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:030011_0059_0FE3BD87C502B700"/>this they had never truly cloſed with Chriſt (or rather Chriſt with them) but had made uſe of him only to help the imperfection of their ſanctification and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and not made him their ſanctification, wiſdom, &amp;c. 3. They expected to believe by ſome power of their own, and not only and wholly from Chriſt." And in 1639, their legiſlature puniſhed a miniſter and ſome people at Weymouth ſeverely, for attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to gather a church there, in which "all baptized ones might communicate without any farther trial of them."<note n="*" place="bottom">Winthrop's Journal, p. 98, 171.</note> This account was given by governor Winthrop, one of the greateſt and beſt men then in New-England. And as no men had a vote in the choice of miniſters but communicants in their church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, ſo they held the power of ordination to be in each church. Mr. Cotton ſaid, "The power of the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſterial calling is derived chiefly from Chriſt, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing his ſervants with gifts fit for the calling; and nextly from the church (or congregation) who, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving ſuch whom the Lord hath gifted, do elect and call them forth to come and help them." Again he ſays, "Though it be our manner (and as we believe according to the word) that every church chooſeth and calleth their own miniſters, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth them by the preſbytery of the ſame church; yet if the preſbytery of other churches commend a miniſter to a vacant church, and upon the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the church, if the preſbyters of thoſe churches do ordain him, with the conſent of the church, we do not profeſs that this is no calling of Chriſt, or that theſe are no miniſters of Chriſt."<note n="†" place="bottom">Anſwer to Williams, part ſecond, 1647, p. 82, 131.</note> And the next year they ſaid in the Cambridge platform, "In ſuch churches where there are elders, impoſition of hands in ordination is to be performed by thoſe elders. In ſuch churches where there are no elders, impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands may be performed by ſome of the

They alſo ſay, "In caſe an elder offend incorrigibly, the matter ſo requiring, as the church had power to call him to office, ſo they have power according to order (the council of other churches, where it may be had, directing thereto) to remove him from his office."<note n="*" place="bottom">Platform, chapters ix, x.</note> Now it is a known rule in grammar, that though a parentheſis is uſeful in its place, yet the ſenſe is complete without it. But in our day, moſt of thoſe who are called Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational miniſters, deny the church's power to ordain or diſmiſs them, unleſs a mutual council di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thereto. Thus they have gone off from the firſt principles of Congregational churches, while they hold the name for worldly ends. But Mr. William Hubbard, in his manuſcript hiſtory, written in 1680, ſays, "There is no juriſdiction, to which as ſuch particular churches are or ought to be ſubject (be it placed in claſſes or ſynod) by way of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative cenſure, nor any church power, extrinſical to the ſaid churches, which they ought to have depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon any other ſort of men for the exerciſe of." And Mr. Jonathan Mitchel of Cambridge had before ſaid, "The over enlarging of full commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or admiſſion of perſons thereto, upon ſlight qualifications, without inſiſting upon the practical and ſpiritual part of religion, will not only loſe the power of godlineſs, but in a little time bring in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs, and ruin the churches, theſe two ways. 1.

But if he is entirely miſtaken, and God hath diſannulled the national covenant which he made with Abraham, it is very hurtful for any to hold the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. It is therefore of great importance for all to have right ideas of this ſubject. And the following conſiderations are offered for that end.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Firſt, Abraham had no right to circumciſe any ſtranger, until he had bought him as a <hi>ſervant</hi> for <hi>money.</hi> Gen. xvii. 12, 13. But God ſays to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Ye are bought with a <hi>price,</hi> be not ye the <hi>ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants</hi> of men. 1 Cor. vii. 23. And he ſays to his min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters, Feed the church of God, which he hath <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed</hi> with his own <hi>blood.</hi> Acts xx. 28. He alſo ſays, Ye have ſold yourſelves for nought, and ye ſhall be redeemed without <hi>money.</hi> And this is the <hi>goſpel of peace.</hi> Iſaiah lii. 3, 7. Rom. x. 15. Thus do the apoſtles explain the prophets. Secondly, The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael had no right to receive ſtrangers into the church by houſeholds, until <hi>the day</hi> in which they
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030011_0064_0FE3BDFB9DF58288"/>came out of Egypt, when the paſſover was inſtituted. And then God ſaid, Every man's ſervant that is bought for money, when thou haſt circumciſed him, then ſhall he eat thereof. Exod. xii. 44—48. Circumciſion and the paſſover were as binding upon ſervants as children; and both ordinances pointed to the <hi>blood</hi> of Chriſt, which he was to ſhed for his people. And, in reference to that, God ſaid, Behold, the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a <hi>new covenant</hi> with the houſe of Iſrael, and with the houſe of Judah; <hi>not according</hi> to the covenant that I made with their fathers in <hi>the day</hi> that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt. Jer. xxxi. 31, 32. And an inſpired apoſtle ſays, In that he ſaith, A <hi>new</hi> covenant, he hath made the firſt <hi>old.</hi> Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh away. He taketh away the <hi>firſt,</hi> that he may eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the <hi>ſecond.</hi> Heb. viii. 7—13. x. 9. And can old and new, firſt and ſecond, mean but one cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? Surely no. Thirdly, <hi>Circumciſion</hi> is the name which God gave to his covenant with Abraham. Acts vii. 8. And though Jews and Mahometans are ſtill zealous for it, yet all Chriſtians allow that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion is repealed. But after the apoſtolic age, men took away the name which God gave to that covenant, and added the name <hi>grace</hi> to it; and they held that <hi>dominion is founded in grace.</hi> And from thence the nations have made <hi>merchandiſe</hi> of all the vanities of time, and of <hi>ſlaves and ſouls of men.</hi> But the <hi>plagues</hi> of Babylon will come upon all men who <hi>add</hi> to the word of God, and take away from the <hi>words</hi> of his book, if they refuſe to come out of that practice. Rev. xviii. 4—13. xxii. 18, 19. And there is not a word in all the bible for bringing any child to baptiſm without his own profeſſion of faith in Chriſt, nor for forcing any man to ſupport any religious miniſter; and all national churches are built upon theſe two ſuperſtitions. Fourthly, Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030011_0065_0FE3BD907B4A8B08"/>was the ſhedding of <hi>human blood;</hi> and when Abraham received it, it was a <hi>ſeal</hi> of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the faith which he before had in Chriſt, in whom believers are <hi>juſtified by his blood.</hi> Rom. iv. 11, 23. v. 9. Gal. iii. 16. Gen. xv. 6. xvii. 24. It was a <hi>ſeal</hi> to him; but neither circumciſion nor baptiſm are ever called ſeals to any other perſon in all the bible. But God ſays to true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Chriſt, In whom alſo after that ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, ye were <hi>ſealed</hi> with that Holy Spirit of prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe. And he alſo ſays, Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are <hi>ſealed</hi> unto the day of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Eph. i. 13. iv. 30. After believing in Chriſt, the Holy Spirit ſeals the merits of his death, and the promiſes of his grace to the ſoul. And all believers from the beginning, looked through the <hi>bloody</hi> ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances which God appointed, to the <hi>blood</hi> of Chriſt for juſtification. And after the beaſt aroſe out of the bottomleſs pit, God ſaid, All that dwell upon the earth ſhall worſhip him, whoſe names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb <hi>ſlain</hi> from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world. Rev. xiii. 8. <hi>Force and cruelty</hi> is the general character of the beaſt; but Jeſus, who is the root and offspring of <hi>David,</hi> will cauſe all <hi>evil beaſts</hi> to ceaſe out of the land. Ezek. xxxiv. 4—25. Rev. xxii. 16. Fifthly, The believing Jews were ſuffered to go on in circumciſion for a number of years after the death of Chriſt, and then God ſaid to them, If ye be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.—Whoſoever of you are juſtified by the <hi>law,</hi> ye are fallen from <hi>grace.</hi> Gal. v. 2—4. So far was the covenant of circumciſion from being the covenant of grace. That bloody ſign not only pointed to the death of Chriſt, but alſo to the death of all true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in him. Therefore Paul ſays, I through the law am <hi>dead</hi> to the law, that I might live unto God. I am <hi>crucified</hi> with Chriſt, nevertheleſs I live; yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me: and the life which I
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030011_0066_0FE3BE002CE679F0"/>now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.— The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: againſt ſuch there is no law. And they that are Chriſt's, have <hi>crucified</hi> the fleſh, with the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and luſts. Gal. ii. 19, 20. v. 22—24. Adam and Chriſt are the only two public heads of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as to the great affairs of the ſoul and eternity. For as by one man's diſobedience, many were <hi>made ſinners;</hi> ſo by the obedience of one, ſhall many be <hi>made righteous.</hi> Rom. v. 19. For parents to bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, is of infinite importance; but we can find no warrant for any to bring them to baptiſm without a perſonal profeſſion of faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Let us now inquire what was the error of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam? When God took the nation of Iſrael to be his church, he was an <hi>huſband</hi> unto them. Jer. xxxi. 32. And Moſes ſaid unto him, If thy preſence go not with us, carry us not up hence. For wherein ſhall it be known here, that I and thy people have found grace in thy ſight? is it not in that thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt with us? So ſhall we be <hi>ſeparated,</hi> I and thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth. Exod. xxxiii. 15, 16. But Balaam, for an earthly <hi>reward,</hi> taught Balak how to deſtroy that <hi>ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aration.</hi> And it was done by the Midianites, among whom Balaam dwelt, who enticed Iſrael into adultery and idolatry; and thoſe Midianites were of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity of Abraham. Numb. xxv. 6. xxxi. 8, 16. Gen. xxv. 4. And how many children of believers are now guilty of this iniquity? For covetouſneſs is <hi>idolatry.</hi> Col. iii. 5. And many make a <hi>god</hi> of their belly. Phil. iii. 19. And idolatry is alſo <hi>adultery</hi> in the ſight of God, who ſaid of the church of Iſrael, Their mother hath played the <hi>harlot;</hi> ſhe that conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them hath done ſhamefully; for ſhe ſaid, I will go
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030011_0067_0FE3BD95AFC8BA20"/>after my <hi>lovers,</hi> that gave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e my bread and my wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink. Hoſea ii. 5. All lawful things, but they were ſought in an unlawful way. So one apoſtle ſays of many teachers and profeſſors, An heart they have exerciſed with <hi>covetous</hi> practices, curſed children; who have forſaken the right way, and are gone aſtray, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way of Balaam the ſon of Boſor, who <hi>loved the wages of unrighteouſneſs;</hi> but was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb aſs, ſpeaking with man's voice, forbad the <hi>madneſs</hi> of the prophet. 2 Peter ii. 14, 15, 16. Another ſays, Woe unto them; for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for <hi>reward,</hi> and periſhed in the gainſaying of Core. Jude 11. And Chriſt ſays by a third, I have a few things againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to caſt a ſtumbling-block before the children of Iſrael, to eat things ſacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication. Rev. ii. 14. Now, ſince covetouſneſs and luxury are idolatry in the ſight of God, and idolatry is alſo adultery, how many are there in the world who entice Chriſtians into theſe evils, in order to graſp the honours and profits of religion to themſelves! Yea, and who go out from the ways of God to gratify their <hi>love of the world!</hi> 1 John ii. 15, 19. Theſe be they who <hi>ſeparate</hi> themſelves, <hi>ſenſual,</hi> having not the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Jude 19. Myſtery Babylon is the <hi>mother of harlots,</hi> and abominations of the earth. Rev. xvii. 5. And it is generally held that theſe things were ſpoken againſt heathen idolatry, and againſt the abominations of the church of Rome. But have miniſters in our land come out of thoſe abominations? For we have before proved that Dr. Stiles and Dr. Lathrop hold to a ſucceſſive power of office through the church of Rome, and Dr. Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins does the ſame, notwithſtanding his great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from many about the doctrines of grace, and
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030011_0068_0FE3BE052B8B79E8"/>the power of godlineſs. For he ſays, "A viſible church may be very corrupt, and yet be a viſible church of Chriſt, and the public adminiſtrations and acts of the officers of it, authentic and valid. And who can prove, that the Pope, and his adherents, were viſibly antichriſt, and that the church of Rome was viſibly not the church of Chriſt, but a falſe church, and was really and properly renounced and excommunicated, by the true church of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of the reformation from popery?"<note n="*" place="bottom">Hopkins's Syſtem, Vol. II. p. 273.</note> Thus he allows that the church of Rome was a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble church of Chriſt, until the Proteſtants renounced her power, and ſet up national churches, who have now carried blood and ſlavery round the world, in galleys and gallant ſhips, as far as the Papiſts ever did. So God ſays of the ſecond beaſt, He cauſeth all, both ſmall and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a <hi>mark</hi> in their right hand, or in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads; and that no man might buy or ſell ſave he that had the mark, or the name of the beaſt, or the number of his name. Here is wiſdom. Let him that hath underſtanding count the number of the beaſt, for it is the number of a <hi>man;</hi> and his number is 666. Rev. xiii. 16—18. God gave his people <hi>reſt,</hi> on the ſeventh day, in the ſeventh month, and the ſeventh year. But the inventions of <hi>men</hi> give no <hi>reſt,</hi> in hundreds, in tens, nor in units. The wicked are like the troubled ſea, when it cannot <hi>reſt.</hi> Iſaiah lvii. 20. Raging waves of the ſea, foaming out their own ſhame. Jude 13. They have no <hi>reſt</hi> day nor night, who worſhip the beaſt and his image, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever receiveth the mark of his name. Rev. xiv. 11. But our Lord ſays, Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you <hi>reſt.</hi> Matt. xi. 28. For we which have believed do enter into <hi>reſt.</hi> Heb. iv. 3. And how clearly do theſe things diſcover the difference between all the believers in
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030011_0069_0FE3BD9A8F271AC8"/>Chriſt, and all other men in the world! For their rock is not as our <hi>Rock,</hi> even our enemies themſelves being judges. For they who think to purchaſe the <hi>gift</hi> of God with <hi>money,</hi> are in the <hi>gall of bitterneſs,</hi> and in the <hi>bond of iniquity.</hi> Deut. xxxii. 31—33. Acts viii. 20—23. All the governments of this world are ſupported by force and money, but the church of Chriſt is purchaſed with his own blood, and is governed by his word and Spirit; and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him, and obeying the revealed will of God by the aſſiſtance of his Spirit, is the only way of min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſterial ſucceſſion that he has appointed. Yea,</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Our author ſays, "The church is not a worldly ſociety; and is not ruled or regulated by civil laws, or the rulers of political, worldly ſocieties: ſuch rulers have no more authority in the church than any other members of it. The viſible church is called in ſcripture, The kingdom of heaven; the kingdom of God, and of Chriſt, who ſays, My king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not of this world."<note n="*" place="bottom">Hopkins, Vol. II. p. 262.</note> How then can any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional churches be churches of Chriſt? For he ſays, Whoſoever ſhall not receive the kingdom of God as a <hi>little child,</hi> he ſhall not enter therein. Mark x. 15. Except ye be converted, and become as this <hi>little child,</hi> ye ſhall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Matt. xviii. 3. And the Father ſays to the Redeemer, This is my <hi>covenant</hi> with them, ſaith the Lord, My <hi>Spirit</hi> that is upon thee, and my <hi>words</hi> which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed's ſeed, ſaith the Lord, from henceforth and forever. Iſa. lix. 20, 21. Which prophecy is applied to future times, when there ſhall be <hi>life from the dead.</hi> Rom. xi. 15—27. But our author applies it to each believing head of a family.<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 336, 337.</note> And in the ſame place he recites part of another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, which might rectify his miſtake in this. Even
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030011_0070_0FE3BE0A2AB85338"/>the place where God ſays, I will pour water upon him that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry ground; I will pour my <hi>Spirit</hi> upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thine offspring: and they ſhall ſpring up as among the graſs, as willows by the water-courſes. One ſhall ſay, I am the Lord's; and another ſhall call himſelf by the name of Jacob; and another ſhall ſubſcribe with his hand unto the Lord, and ſurname himſelf by the name of Iſrael. Iſaiah xliv. 3—5. So when God poured out his Spirit, after the aſcenſion of Chriſt, They who gladly received his word, were baptized. And again he ſays, <hi>Believers</hi> were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both <hi>men</hi> and <hi>women.</hi> Acts ii. 41. v. 14. Circumciſion was only for the <hi>males,</hi> but <hi>females</hi> are equally the ſubjects of baptiſm, which proves and eſſential change of the cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enant. And our Lord gave the goſpel commiſſion to the <hi>eleven,</hi> who were all born again; and he ſaid to them, Go teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: teaching them to obſerve all things, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. Matt. xxviii. 16—20. This promiſe is only to his children, in the way of obedience to all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. And as the covenant of circumciſion gave Iſrael a right to buy the heathen for ſervants, and circumciſion was only for the males, the goſpel ſays to believers, Ye are all the <hi>children of God</hi> by faith in Chriſt Jeſus. For as many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus. And if ye be Chriſt's, then are ye Abraham's ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe. Gal. iii. 26—29. Abraham was an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent type of Chriſt, and none are his ſpiritual ſeed but believers in Chriſt. How great then is the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:030011_0071_0FE3BD9F5C3E1E28"/>of all who put themſelves in the place of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham! Our author was ſo far from believing that the Baptiſts ſinned againſt the light of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, as Balaam did, that he ſays, "There is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, that moſt, if not all, who believe in the baptiſm of children, and practiſe it, are more guilty and offenſive to Chriſt, in their treatment of this inſtitution, than the Antipedobaptiſts are."<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 398.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. And another miniſter of his ſentiments has given further light in this matter, in an anſwer to Dr. Hemmenway. He obſerves that the covenant of grace is always the ſame, under every diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, and that a peculiar deſign of God's promiſe to Abraham was, "To keep up the viſible church, and maintain a conſtant ſucceſſion of pious men, in his family, until the appearance of the promiſed Meſſiah."<note n="†" place="bottom">Emmons againſt Hemmenway, 1793, p. 27.</note> This is undoubtedly true, and a moſt important truth; for God ſaid of Abraham, I know him, that he will command his children and his houſehold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do juſtice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath ſpoken of him. Gen. xviii. 19. <hi>He will, and they ſhall,</hi> was the language of God's covenant with Abraham; but <hi>I will, and they ſhall,</hi> is the language of the <hi>new covenant,</hi> ſince the death of Chriſt. Heb. viii. 10. x. 9. It was the <hi>will</hi> of God that the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble church ſhould continue in the line of Abraham's poſterity, until Chriſt came and died for his people, and then the Holy Spirit was given, and believing Jews and Gentiles were united in his church. And they never were called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> until believing Gentiles were received into the church without cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion. Acts xi. 26. Yet, as our author ſays, "Dr. Hemmenway has followed other writers in arguing from the former diſpenſations of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:030011_0072_0FE3BE0E561B87D8"/>of grace to the preſent, and endeavoured to prove what the peculiar duties of believers are under the preſent diſpenſation of the covenant of grace, from what they were under its former diſpenſations. But this mode of reaſoning is by no means conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. It was the duty of believers under former diſpenſations of the covenant of grace to offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; but can we hence infer, that it is their duty now? It was the duty of believers under former diſpenſations of the covenant of grace, to circumciſe their children and attend the paſſover; but does it hence follow, that thoſe duties are ſtill binding? or can we juſtly conclude, that it is the duty of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers now to circumciſe their children, or even to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them, becauſe it <hi>was once</hi> their duty to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe them? The truth is, we muſt learn the peculiar duties of believers under the preſent diſpenſation of the convenant of grace, from the diſpenſation itſelf, which enjoins all the peculiar duties which belong to it.—The Chriſtian diſpenſation, which is allowed to be the freeſt from types and figures, plainly ſpeaks for itſelf. And we ought to look into the clear diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the goſpel, in order to diſcover the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar duties of believers at this day."<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 43, 44.</note> Yea, and how happy ſhould we ſoon be, if the goſpel light was followed by all, without trying to draw the vail of the law over it? As long as the death of Chriſt was a future event, the bloody ordinances of the law, and circumciſion in particular, were given to many who did not know him; but ſince his death he ſays, All ſhall know me, from the leaſt to the greateſt. Heb. viii. 11. And in baptiſm and the holy ſupper, all the lawful ſubjects thereof openly manifeſt their faith in the death of Chriſt as a paſt event, and their engagement to love and live to him all their days. And if it were fully allowed that God hath diſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled the covenant of circumciſion which he made
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:030011_0073_0FE3BDA48C9BD820"/>with Abraham, as well as the reſt of the law of typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ceremonies, and hath built his church upon a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter covenant, eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes, the effects would be very glorious, and ſilence many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies. But the holding that the children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are born in the covenant of grace, or that baptiſm can bring them into it, without their own knowledge or choice, is ſuch a <hi>confounding</hi> of grace and works together as holds multitudes in blindneſs and bondage. And this appears in the following inſtance.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Mr. Joſeph Snow, of Providence, met with a happy change, in the glorious revival of religion in 1741; and he was ſoon called to preach the goſpel, and a Congregational church was formed under his miniſtry, and he was ordained their paſtor, Feb. 12, 1747. A meeting-houſe was built for them, which was afterwards enlarged, and they became a numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and honourable ſociety,<note n="*" place="bottom">His excellency Nicholas Cooke, a member of that church, was choſen governor of the State of Rhode-Iſland in 1775, and was continued in that office to 1779. He died September 14, 1782. He was a Baptiſt himſelf though in communion with a Congregational church.</note> and collected a fund of money for the ſupport of their miniſters. And as Mr. Snow was advanced in years, and a young min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter arrived there from Ireland in the ſpring of 1791, he was called to aſſiſt him in preaching for two years. But in that time he drew off the majority of the church and congregation from the doctrine of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign grace, to the way of confounding works and grace together. And as Mr. Snow tried to get him diſmiſſed from them, a majority of the church drew up a number of accuſations againſt Mr. Snow, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſilence him from preaching. But he and his brethren called a council, who fully cleared him from thoſe accuſations. And as ſaid teacher was of the Methodiſt denomination, he could not have a legal right to the property of that Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſociety; therefore he changed his name to
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:030011_0074_0FE3BE1336C220A0"/>that of Congregational; and a majority of the church ſent to four churches in the Maſſachuſetts, and to two in the State of Rhode-Iſland, for aſſiſtance in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining ſaid miniſter in their church. Upon which Mr. Snow, and many of his brethren, ſent for anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er council, to meet at the ſame time; and they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed Mr. Snow, and thoſe who held with him, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in their former faith and conduct, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their hand of fellowſhip from all their brethren who had gone off from the ſame, and refuſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. And this advice was taken, and Mr. Snow and thoſe who held with him warned the other council not to ordain the young miniſter in their meeting-houſe. Yet in the face of all this, they went into ſaid houſe, on October 17, 1793, and ordained him as a <hi>colleague paſtor</hi> in that church. A number of that part of the church who were ſo reſolute for the young miniſter, were Baptiſts, who had communed with others who were only ſprinkled in infancy. But as they could then diſpenſe with one plain law of Chriſt, ſo they now could with another, in the manner above deſcribed. And in the ſummer of 1794; Mr. Snow and his brethren were entirely ſhut out of their meeting-houſe, becauſe they would not join with a miniſter whom they viewed as one who <hi>perverted the goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. i. 7.<note n="*" place="bottom">In 1795, a new meeting-houſe was built for Mr. Snow, by the help of generous perſons of various denominations.</note> At the ſame time, the miniſters in the Maſſachuſetts were for holding faſt their power to the laſt extremity.</p>

The firſt pariſh in Rocheſter ſettled a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter in 1768, with a promiſe of two hundred pounds ſettlement, and eighty pounds a year ſalary, as long as his paſtoral relation to them continued. But his looſe principles carried him into ſuch, evils, that a mutual council was called there in September, 1791, who judged him to be guilty of groſs immoralities; and another council was called by the church in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030011_0075_0FE3BDA8370B6E40"/>following, who adviſed them to diſmiſs him, which they did, and the pariſh ſhut him out of their meeting-houſe. Yet he held worſhip with a minor part of the people elſewhere, for two years and an half, and then ſued the whole pariſh for his ſalary all that time. But as he was caſt at the inferior court, he appealed to the ſupreme judicial court, who met at Plymouth, May 20, 1794; and after the hearing of a whole day, the judges gave their opinion in his favour, but the jury turned the caſe againſt him. The judges allowed ſeveral Rocheſter men to be witneſſes for ſaid miniſter, but refuſed to admit any man from that town as a witneſs againſt him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſaid they were intereſted perſons. So in two former caſes, when the Baptiſts ſued for their rights, noted men of their denomination were not admitted as witneſſes of plain facts. Our ſecond volume, p. 241, 262. But God ſays, With what judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ye judge, ye ſhall be judged; and with what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again. Matt. vii. 2. And how is he fulfilling his word! For taxes to ſupport religious miniſters, is taxing men where they are not repreſented, as no man can anſwer for another to God in ſuch caſes. Yet America has been full of this wickedneſs; and all the blood that was ſhed in the American war turned upon this point. And how full is our land now of complaints againſt our chief rulers, becauſe their property has been tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en away by the Britiſh powers, and they muſt ſue for it again in Britiſh courts? Though thoſe powers are no more intereſted againſt America, than every hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling teacher is, againſt all who refuſe to ſupport him. For they bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare war againſt him. Micah iii. 5. And how much is this cry now heard in Europe and America? And one of the principles of Congregational churches is,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030011_0076_0FE3BE184A1DD030"/>that no church act can be conſummated without the conſent of both elders and brethren.<note n="*" place="bottom">Cambridge Platform, chap. x. ſect. 11.</note> Which is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miniſters ſuch a power over the church, as our ſupreme judges have not over the jury. And ſaid miniſter in Rocheſter was ſettled in the name of the king of Great-Britain, and he hath been ſupported lately by the <hi>carcaſs</hi> of that authority. But God ſays, Let them put away their <hi>whoredom,</hi> and the <hi>carcaſſes</hi> of their kings far from me, and I will dwell in the midſt of them forever.—This is the law of the houſe; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of the mountain, the whole limit thereof round about ſhall be <hi>moſt holy:</hi> behold, this is the law of the houſe. Ezek. xliii. 9, 12. But falſe men ſay, Stand by thyſelf, come not near to me, for I am <hi>holier</hi> than thou. Iſaiah lxv. 5. Teachers claim a holy power of office, above the church of God; and in every nation, the ruling ſect imagine themſelves to be holier than thoſe who have not the power of the magiſtrate to ſupport their worſhip. Though God ſays to his children, This ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean perſon, nor <hi>covetous</hi> man who is an <hi>idolater,</hi> hath any inheritance in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, and of God. Let no man deceive you with vain words; for becauſe of theſe things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. Be not ye therefore partakers with them. Eph. v. 5—7. But how can any church avoid par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking with whoremongers, unclean perſons, and cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etous men who are idolaters, if they have any fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with worſhip and miniſters that are ſupported by force?

                  </gap>ere very careful to keep the church from interfering with civil government. For when a man deſired Jeſus to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe his influence in dividing of an inheritance, he
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:030011_0077_0FE3BDADA7455C28"/>ſaid unto him, Man, who made me a judge, or a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vider over you? And he plainly holds forth, that the <hi>leaven of hypocriſy</hi> is promoted by confounding the government of church and ſtate together. Luke xii, 1, 14, 15. And in order to purge the <hi>old leaven</hi> from the church, Paul ſays, I have written unto you, not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or <hi>covetous,</hi> or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with ſuch an one, no not to eat. For what have I to do to judge them alſo that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within? But them that are without, God judgeth. Therefore put away from among your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that wicked perſon. 1 Cor. v. 7—13. Cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etouſneſs is here put before idolatry, for it is the <hi>root of all evil.</hi> I Tim. vi. 10. And it is eaſier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. But blind guides ſtrain at a gnat, and ſwallow a camel. Matt. xix. 24. xxiii. 24. And who can tell how many blind guides there are in our day? And the confounding the conſtitutions of the Hebrew and the Chriſtian churches together, is the way in which they yoke Chriſtians with the world. But God ſays to his church, Be ye not unequally <hi>yoked</hi> together with <hi>unbelievers;</hi> for what fellowſhip hath righteouſneſs with unrighteouſneſs? and what communion hath light with darkneſs? and what concord hath Chriſt with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? and what agreement hath the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God with idols? For ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath ſaid, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye <hi>ſeparate,</hi> ſaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye ſhall be my
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030011_0078_0FE3BE1D2C7656E8"/>ſons and daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty. 2 Cor. vi. 14—18. And this call is not of a local, but of a ſpiritual nature. It is not from civil commerce with unbelievers, but from being <hi>yoked</hi> with them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the church, which is the temple of the living God, and is to be governed wholly by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will, under the influence of his Spirit. But where worldly force is uſed to ſupport religious min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters, it will be conſcientiouſly oppoſed by the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and villains will hide behind ſuch oppoſition, and ſo the government both of church and ſtate are injured. Whereas if all were protected impartially, they who act from heavenly motives would ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the hands of civil rulers, and hold up light to draw others out of evil ways, and to guard againſt all iniquity. And it will yet be ſaid, Look upon Zion the city of our ſolemnities: thine eyes ſhall ſee Jeruſalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that ſhall not be taken down; not one of the ſtakes thereof ſhall ever be removed, neither ſhall any of the cords thereof be broken. But there the glorious Lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers and ſtreams, wherein ſhall go no galley with oars, neither ſhall gallant ſhips paſs thereby. For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our law-giver the Lord is our king; he will ſave us. Iſaiah xxxiii. 20—22. Now if we conſider, that galleys and gallant ſhips are the greateſt engines of war and ſlavery in all the world, and that they are upheld by national churches, how loud is the call from Heaven to come out and be ſeparate from all ſuch churches!</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Indeed Dr. Lathrop, in order to keep up the power of miniſters which he pleads for, ſays, "A Chriſtian church is compared to a houſehold, and to a city, in reſpect of the order and government, the peace and unity, that ought to be preſerved in it. But if every man might aſſume the office of a teacher at pleaſure, where would be the order and unity?
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030011_0079_0FE3BDB296885B38"/>There would be the ſame confuſion and diſtraction, as in a State where every one claimed a right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the powers of magiſtracy."<note n="*" place="bottom">Diſcourſes on Matthew vii. 15, 16. p. 10, 11.</note> But in all the States of New-England, the people can leave their governors, and all their legiſlators out of office every year, if they pleaſe, while all the miniſters, who are ſupported by tax and compulſion, deny the people any ſuch liberty concerning themſelves. When the people have elected their rulers, ſome men are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to give them an oath, to be faithful in their offices; and when the church of Chriſt hath choſen her miniſters, ſhe hath a right to call other miniſters to ordain them, and to give them a ſolemn charge to be faithful to God and to his people. But ever ſince miniſters have claimed a power of office above all other men in the world, the government of the churches, the cities of God, has lain waſte, to the grief of all pious people. Though the time is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when our Lord will give ſuch comfort and ſtrength to them who <hi>mourn in Zion,</hi> that he ſays, They ſhall build the old waſtes, they ſhall raiſe up the former deſolations, they ſhall repair the waſte <hi>cities,</hi> the deſolations of many generations. Iſaiah lxi. 1—4. This our Lord applies to the bleſſings of his Spirit under the goſpel. Luke iv. 18, 19. Every church of Chriſt is a holy city, which has a right to cenſure and exclude all members and officers who break his laws, and refuſe to manifeſt repentance therefor. And when they ſhall come to exerciſe this power faithfully, <hi>independent</hi> of all the powers of the world, ſuch peace will be enjoyed as never hath yet been upon earth. And the power of one ſect in our land, to compel all others to bow to them in religious affairs, is daily conſuming, by the light and power of the goſpel. One evidence of this lately appeared in Medfield. A Baptiſt church was conſtituted there in 1776; and they built them a convenient houſe
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030011_0080_0FE3BB05E18976E8"/>for worſhip, and another for the miniſtry, and they have maintained regular worſhip among them ever ſince. Yet all the Baptiſts in Medfield were lately taxed to the Congregational miniſter of that town; and one of their committee was ſeized for that tax, and was impriſoned at Boſton, July 2, 1794. But it cauſed ſuch an alarm in Boſton, and the news from thence which reached to Medfield the next Saturday, cauſed ſuch an alarm there, that two men were ſent twenty miles on the Lord's day, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed the priſoner, without his paying the tax, or any coſts about it. And very few now in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try will dare to make diſtreſs upon any for miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial taxes.</p>
               <p n="10">X. And if the marks of falſe teachers, which the above author has publiſhed, were rightly applied, the church of Chriſt would ſoon have ſuch deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from their power as ſhe hath not yet enjoyed. For he ſays, "Another mark of falſe teachers is an implacable malignity againſt the ſtanding, regular miniſters of the goſpel." And again he ſays, "This ſort of teachers are guided by no <hi>line,</hi> and confined to no <hi>meaſure;</hi> but run from place to place, enter into other men's labours, and build on other men's <hi>foundation.</hi>"<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 29, 31.</note> Very true; and the word of Chriſt is daily fulfilled, who ſaid to falſe teachers among the Jews, Ye compaſs ſea and land to make one proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourſelves. Matthew xxiii. 15. And we may ſee at this day, that the Jews have a fixed regard for the law of Moſes, and for the land of Canaan; but proſelytes to revealed religion, who are not born again, have no fixed rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, nor any country that can ſet any bounds to their love of riches, honours or pleaſures. Some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful men in the church of Corinth, accuſed Paul of going beyond his authority in what he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030011_0081_0FE3BDB796675A00"/>to that church. Therefore he ſaid, The weap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our warfare are <hi>not carnal,</hi> but mighty through God to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, caſting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth itſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt; and having in a readineſs to revenge all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.—For we ſtretch not ourſelves beyond our <hi>meaſure,</hi> as though we reached not unto you; for we are come as far as to you alſo, in preaching the goſpel of Chriſt: not boaſting of things without our <hi>meaſure,</hi> that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increaſed, that we ſhall be enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by you according to our rule abundantly, to preach the goſpel in the region beyond you, and not to boaſt in another man's <hi>line,</hi> of things made ready to our hand. But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. For not he that commendeth himſelf is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth. 2 Cor. x. 4, 5, 14—18. The line and meaſure which he ſpake of was drawn by God himſelf, and not by any worldly powers. So the ſame apoſtle ſaid to another church, I will not dare to ſpeak of any of thoſe things, which Chriſt hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word or deed, through mighty ſigns and wonders, by the <hi>power of the Spirit of God;</hi> ſo that from Jeruſalem and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the goſpel of Chriſt. Yea, ſo have I ſtrived to preach the goſpel, not where Chriſt was named, leſt I ſhould build upon another man's <hi>foundation.</hi> Rom. xv. 18—20. And can any man believe that the words, meaſure, line, and foundation, as Paul uſed them, can juſtify the uſe of <hi>carnal</hi> weapons in forcing all people within lines which men have drawn, to ſupport teachers who ſtand upon worldly eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? For other <hi>foundation</hi> can no man lay than
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:030011_0082_0FE3BE25E31FF180"/>that which is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt. Now if any man build upon this foundation, gold, ſilver, precious ſtones, wood, hay, ſtubble: every man's work ſhall be made manifeſt. For the day ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it, becauſe it ſhall be revealed by fire; and the fire ſhall try every man's work, of what ſort it is, 1 Cor. iii. 11—13.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. And the fiery trials of the preſent day may afford much clearer light than our fathers enjoyed. For they baniſhed Mr. Roger Williams, becauſe he teſtified againſt any uſe of the ſword in religious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and againſt their receiving the grant of Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican lands from the kings of England. One of his reaſons againſt ſuch things, was what our Lord ſays of the tares of the field, which Williams held to be the world, and not the church.<note n="*" place="bottom">Williams on the Bloody Tenet, 1644. p. 44.</note> But Mr. Cotton ſaid, "It is not the will of Chriſt, that antichriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity ſhould be tolerated in the world, until the end of the world. For God will put it into the hearts of faithful princes (as they have given their kingdoms to the beaſt, ſo) in fulneſs of time to hate the whore, and to leave her deſolate and naked, and to burn her fleſh with fire. Rev. xvii. 16, 17."<note n="†" place="bottom">Cotton on the Bloody Tenet Waſhed, 1647. p. 42, 43.</note> Williams had before ſaid, "This hating and deſolating and making naked and burning, ſhall not ariſe by way of an <hi>ordinance</hi> warranted by the inſtitution of Chriſt Jeſus; but by way of <hi>providence,</hi> when (as it uſeth to be with <hi>whores</hi> and their <hi>lovers</hi>) the church of Rome and her great lovers ſhall fall out; and, by the righteous vengeance of God upon her, drunk with the blood of the ſaints, theſe <hi>mighty fornicators</hi> ſhall turn their love into hatred, which ſhall make her a poor naked whore, torn and conſumed."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Williams, p. 246.</note> But Cotton made no reply to this; and how have the nations of Europe now fallen out, and have taken the riches of the national churches, to ſupport war
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:030011_0083_0FE3BDBADB83B380"/>and vengeance againſt their cruel oppreſſors! And is not this eating her fleſh, and burning her with fire? But the fathers of that day were ſo much afraid of the tyranny of European powers, that Cotton ſaid, "The Lord keep us from being bewitched with the whore's cup, leſt while we ſeem to deteſt and reject her with open face of profeſſion, we do not bring her in by a back door of toleration."<note n="*" place="bottom">Bloody Tenet Waſhed, p. 192.</note> And Dr. Increaſe Mather quoted this paſſage thirty years afterwards, and then ſaid, "I believe that antichriſt hath not at this day a more probable way to advance his kingdom of darkneſs, than by a tol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For Mr. John Thayer, who was born in Boſton, went to Rome, and joined to their church in May, 1783, from whence he returned through Maryland, and arrived at Boſton in January, 1790; and he hath preached up the infallibility of the church of Rome, prayers for the dead, and other opinions of theirs, with very little ſucceſs.

               <p n="12">XII. Dr. Increaſe Mather ſaid to the churches of New-England, "If we eſpouſe ſuch principles as theſe, namely, That churches are not to inquire into

                  </gap>ven ſo was it with old churches, in which the doings of men were blended with the perfect righteouſneſs of Chriſt for juſtification, and the inventions of men with his laws for their government. For by the year 1744, all the miniſters in New-England who were ſupported by the laws of men, were afraid to preach in any pariſh where another miniſter was ſettled againſt his conſent; which was making miniſters <hi>lords</hi> over God's heritage, to gratify their love of <hi>filthy lucre.</hi> 1 Peter v. 2, 3. And ſeparations from ſuch miniſters and churches took place from that time, until many embraced believers' baptiſm, in and after 1749. And a great change hath alſo taken place in many old Baptiſt churches. And now loud com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:030011_0085_0FE3BB64150DBD70"/>are made againſt the Baptiſts, becauſe they dare not commune in the ordinance of the ſupper, with thoſe who were only ſprinkled in their infancy. But how unreaſonable are theſe complaints! For our apoſtle ſays, We, brethren, as Iſaac was, are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of promiſe. But as then, he that was born af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh perſecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even ſo it is now. Nevertheleſs, what ſaith the ſcripture? Caſt out the bond woman and her ſon; for the ſon of the bond woman ſhall not be heir with the ſon of the free woman. So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bond woman, but of the free. Stand faſt, therefore, in the liberty where with Chriſt hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. Gal. iv. 28—31. v. 1. And how can we obey this law of Chriſt, if we commune with any in the holy ſupper who were only ſprinkled in their infancy? And a late inſtance may help to ſhew the evil of ſuch covenants. A man in one of the Congregational churches was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he was not born again, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained from coming to the ordinance of the ſupper. And after he obtained relief in his own mind, he viewed ſuch evils in the church, and his wife alſo, that they thought they could not in conſcience come to communion therein, and refrained from it. The church ſent a committee to labour with them, and they requeſted a diſmiſſion from the church; but inſtead of it, a cenſure was ſent to them, which ſaid, "With grief of heart we inform you, that we are greatly ſtumbled at your conduct, in breaking a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn and ſacred covenant with us, in which you bound yourſelves, in the preſence of the great God, to walk in communion with us. By thus breaking communion with us, you are guilty of the worſt kind of perjury. By refuſing to attend communion, or even public worſhip with us, you have unchriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized the whole church, and have really excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:030011_0086_0FE3BB2A6E48FFC0"/>us." And after trying to prove this from ſcripture, and reciting the law of Chriſt about the power of binding and looſing, they ſay, "We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly have met in the name of Jeſus, and in his name we bind you under the cenſure of its firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition." This was dated November 28, 1794. The miniſter who ſent them this cenſure has been a noted advocate for ſupporting their way by law in our country. But how great muſt be the bondage of any people, who muſt come to communion in a ſociety where church and world are bound together, or be accuſed of the worſt kind of perjury? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the ſaid man and his wife renounced thoſe ways, and were baptized this year, and joined to a Baptiſt church. And how great is the privilege which we enjoy, to anſwer a good conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, in the midſt of all the confuſions of the world!</p>

And the victory over them was accounted ſo great a favour, that a day of thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefor was kept through all theſe United States, February 19, 1795.

Jer. xxiii. 6, 30—32. The precepts and promiſes of God are ever connected together; and no man hath any more right to any promiſe which Chriſt hath made to his miniſters, who doth not love and obey him with all his heart, than thieves and robbers have to the property of honeſt men. John x. 1—9. And how much ſtealing of his words is there in our land?

But a zealous advocate for it lately ſaid, "It is difficult to ſay what is the preſent eccleſiaſtical conſtitution of the Congregational churches." And as to their faith, he ſays, "The body of them are Calviniſts; a reſpectable proportion are what may be denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Hopkinſian Calviniſts; beſide theſe, ſome are Arminians, ſome Arians, a few Socinians, and a number who have adopted Dr. Chauncy's ſcheme of the final ſalvation of all men."<note n="*" place="bottom">Morſe's Geography, 1793, firſt part. p. 252, 253.</note> This account is doubtleſs true in general, though it is queſtionable whether there are not more Arminians in the churches who are ſupported by law in this country, than there are of Calviniſts. And vaſt pains have been taken, both in Europe and America, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the people, that all the wars and tyranny that have ever taken place under the Chriſtian name, have proceeded from the doctrines of Calviniſm. For it is well known that Auguſtine, and other fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the church in the third and fourth century, held to the ſame doctrines which Calvin embraced
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:030011_0088_0FE3BE2F35CA9970"/>in the time of the reformation from popery. But God ſays, Woe be to the ſhepherds of Iſrael, that feed themſelves: ſhould not the ſhepherds feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed, but ye feed not the flock. The diſeaſed have ye not ſtrengthened, neither have ye healed that which was ſick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye ſought that which was loſt; but with <hi>force</hi> and with <hi>cruelty</hi> have ye ruled them.—And as for you, O my flock, thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he-goats. Seemeth it a ſmall thing unto you, to have eaten up the good paſture, but ye muſt tread down with your feet the reſidue of your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye muſt foul the reſidue with your feet? Ezek. xxxiv. 2—18. This is an exact deſcription of the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of falſe teachers and profeſſors, in every age and country, where revelation hath been known. The love of ſelf, and of earthly power and gain, with ignorance of the infinite perfections of God, and a going about to eſtabliſh a righteouſneſs of their own, hath cauſed all the oppreſſions and cruel perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions that ever were upon earth. And men have trampled upon the precious doctrines of the goſpel, and have defiled the deep waters of revelation, as wantonly and as cruelly as wanton cattle ever did, againſt the weak or the diſeaſed. But if men in general were willing to be taught of God, and to obey the pure voice of his holy word, ſuch peace and happineſs would ſoon be enjoyed, as they will not now believe to be poſſible in this world.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Arians and Socinians, both deny that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is God by nature, and the latter hold him to be no more than man. But there is no ſuch faith as theirs in heaven, nor in hell, nor in heathen dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:030011_0089_0FE3BDC52ED201F8"/>For all the angels of heaven worſhip Jeſus as the Son of God. Heb. i. 6. Luke ii. 9—14. And the devils ſaid, What have we to do with thee, Jeſus thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time? Matt. viii. 29. And the great philoſophers at Athens, the greateſt ſeat of learning in the heathen world, got no further than to erect an altar <hi>to the unknown God,</hi> in the midſt of many idols. Acts xvii. 23. So that all men who profeſs to worſhip but One God, and yet deny that Jeſus Chriſt is truly God, have corrupted their minds more than the devils ever could do, and have carried phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and vain deceit beyond what the old hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens ever did. And God ſays, Theſe ſpeak evil of thoſe things which they know not; but what they know naturally, as brute beaſts, in thoſe things they corrupt themſelves. Jude 10. It is impoſſible to harden brute beaſts againſt fear of danger, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that many men harden themſelves againſt the fear of God's wrath in a future world. The cauſe why earthly governments have no right to admit ſureties in capital caſes, is becauſe the children of men cannot juſtly lay crimes upon any innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor raiſe a dead one to life, nor change the heart of a criminal. But it is as certain as any truth in the bible, that the Son of God freely gave himſelf to die for our ſins, and that he aroſe again for our juſtification, and that he gives the Holy Spirit to change the heart of the chief of ſinners, and to guide them in the way of holineſs to eternal happineſs. And it is not more certain from the word of God, that the righteous will have everlaſting life, than it is that all men who die in their ſins will have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting miſery in hell. And all men who hold the contrary, deſtroy the influence of promiſes and oaths, more than they do in the church of Rome, where they hold that ſome men will have their ſins purged away after death, by the help of the prayers of the
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:030011_0090_0FE3BE3251DAF028"/>living. Therefore the Congregational churches in New-England, have more pernicious errors held up among them, than there are in the church of Rome. And the apoſtle John ſays, Beloved, believe not ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſpirit, but try the ſpirits whether they be of God; becauſe many falſe prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every ſpirit that confeſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is of God. And every ſpirit that confeſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is not of God: and this is that ſpirit of antichriſt, whereof ye have heard that it ſhould come, and even now already is it in the world. Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them; becauſe greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. They are of the world, therefore ſpeak they of the world, and the world heareth them. 1 John iv. 1—5. And worldly property is the only qualification for voters in our governments, for rulers and miniſters; and yet each pariſh in Connecticut, is called an eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical ſociety in the laws by which they ſupport their miniſters. That is, they are worldly churches. And though the Maſſachuſetts do not call each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh a church, yet they put the whole power of taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for religious teachers into the hands of the world, without the leaſt regard to the church of Chriſt in that reſpect. In another law, which was made in 1786, the deacons of each church are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to receive donations for religious purpoſes, which they are to manage according to the deſign of the donors, for the good of the church. And this opens a door for leading a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty. But the compelling of any man to ſupport any religious teacher whom he doth not chooſe, is a denial of the authority of Chriſt. For he ſays, As ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye alſo to them likewiſe.—For every tree is known by his own fruit; for of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble-buſh gather they grapes. A
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:030011_0091_0FE3BDCA12E839A8"/>good man out of the good treaſure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treaſure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil; for of the abundance of the heart his mouth ſpeaketh. And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I ſay? Luke vi. 31, 44—46. How do all men practically deny Jeſus Chriſt to be Lord, who refuſe to believe and obey him? For unto the pure all things are pure; but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving, is noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pure; but even their mind and conſcience is defiled. They profeſs that they know God, but in woks they deny him, being abominable, and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, and unto every good work reprobate. Titus i. 15, 16. And all men allow that actions ſpeak louder than words, and alſo that injuries from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed friends, are more grievous than from open en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies. How full then is the world of the iniquity of denying that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh? And this is according to the prophecy which ſays, There are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, turning the grace of our God into laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civiouſneſs, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Jude 4. All men who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge themſelves in ſin becauſe God is infinitely gracious, are more or leſs guilty of theſe evils. And though the national church of Iſrael was conſtituted by God himſelf, yet all orders among them became ſo corrupt that he ſaid, The beſt of them is as a bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the moſt upright is ſharper than a thorn-hedge. Micah vii. 4. And if it was ſo with a church which God formed, how much more deſtructive are churches that are formed by the laws of men, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by the ſword? How do all men practically deny Jeſus Chriſt to be Lord, who refuſe to obey his laws for the government of his church? But how have the churches increaſed in our land, who hold him to be their only lawgiver?</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. WHAT ſhall we think of the prophecy in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this volume? For it ſays, "Through the liberty enjoyed here, all religious ſects will grow up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to large and reſpectable bodies. But the Congregation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Preſbyterian denomination, however hitherto deſpiſed, will, by the bleſſing of Heaven, continue to hold the greateſt figure in America; and, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the fruitleſs labours and exertions to proſelyte us to other communions, become more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous than the whole collective body of our fellow Proteſtants in Europe. The whole proſelytiſm of New-England in particular, for ſixty or ſeventy years paſt, has not exceeded eight or ten thouſand, while our augment in that term, by natural increaſe, has been half a million." In the firſt place there was a great miſtake, in ſuppoſing that religious liberty would favour the growth of religious ſects. For cruel oppreſſion was the cauſe of the increaſe of ſects in England, as it was of the flight of our fathers into America. And the hanging of four Quakers in Boſton, greatly promoted their ſect in this country;
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:030011_0107_0FE3BEBC8C2F04C0"/>and the light and liberty which has been enjoyed in latter years has been far from increaſing their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. The ſect which John Rogers began at New-London in 1677, owed its increaſe to the ſeverity of Connecticut government againſt them; and ſince that has ceaſed, their ſociety has nearly diſſolved. And although the Sandemanians made a great noiſe in New-England, from 1764 to 1775, yet, having no oppreſſion to complain of, they have hardly a name now left among us. The followers of Jemima Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon, alſo, who made their appearance October, 1776, and continued for ſome years after, are now all gone from among us. And though the Shakers were a large body when the above prophecy was publiſhed, yet we ſeldom hear of them now, unleſs it be by way of obſerving that the power which then actuated them is gone; and their attention is much fixed upon worldly ſchemes of gain. Epiſcopalians received vaſt ſums of money from England to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their miniſters, from 1701 to 1775, and thoſe who turned to them were exempted from taxes to Congregational miniſters; and as oppreſſion was greater in Connecticut, than in other governments in New-England, they increaſed the moſt there; but ſince the independence of America, they do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in moſt parts of the country; and in the whole of the old colony of Plymouth they have but one miniſter, and he hath but a few hearers. And if the Congregational and Preſbyterian miniſters in the Maſſachuſetts, Connecticut, New-Hampſhire and Vermont, had not the ſword of the magiſtrate to ſupport them, no one can tell how ſmall their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber would ſoon be.</p>
               <p n="2">II. And as the above prophecy refers to all Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica, we are called to look into our ſouthern States. After our independence was eſtabliſhed, the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians in thoſe parts entered upon meaſures to unite all their ſocieties under one head; to promote which,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:030011_0108_0FE3BF088CB15420"/>a book was publiſhed in North-Carolina in 1788, wherein the author ſays, "I have often thought, that the popular Congregational government of the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, joined to the Preſbyterial judicatures, as a final reſort, would form the moſt perfect model of church government that the ſtate of things on earth will admit of." But this model hath been tried in Connecticut, with the ſword of the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate to help it, ever ſince 1708, and how far is it now from perfection? In the ſame page, the author ſays of the Baptiſts in thoſe parts, "Conſidering that they have no written ſtandard of orthodoxy, and that their preachers are men without a liberal education, I have often ſat with wonder and pleaſure to hear them ſo ſound in doctrine as they really are. In church government, the Baptiſts have adopted the independent plan; the inconveniency of which they often experience, as it provides no final and deciſive judge of controverſy, nor tribunal to pronounce on hereſy or falſe doctrine. But the diſtinguiſhing characteriſtic of the Baptiſt profeſſion is their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding infant, and practiſing only adult baptiſm, and making it their great term of communion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all other Chriſtians from the Lord's table among them, and not ſuffering their members to communicate with other churches. How they can acknowledge any other people to be a church of Chriſt, and yet continue this bar of ſeparation, is not to be accounted for."<note n="*" place="bottom">Pattillo's Sermons, p. 48, 49.</note> But if the holy ſcriptures are not a perfect ſtandard of orthodoxy, and if each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular church of Chriſt hath not power from him to receive all members and officers who are deſcribed therein, and alſo to exclude all officers and members who break his laws and refuſe to manifeſt repentance therefor, we know not where to go for any rule of faith and conduct; nor for power to govern us in religious affairs. And as to his laſt difficulty, it may
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:030011_0109_0FE3BEC1A47BA150"/>be obſerved, that circumciſion was as neceſſary in a member of the church of Iſrael, as baptiſm can be in the church of Chriſt: yet Moſes, that eminent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, did not circumciſe his children while he was in Midian; but when he was going to lead Iſrael out of their bondage in Egypt, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to have them circumciſed, even at the peril of his own life. Exod. iv. 24, 25. And the nation of Iſrael were the church of God in the wilderneſs, and yet they did not circumciſe their children for forty years; though they were not ſuffered to neglect it in the promiſed land. Joſhua v. 2—5. And the church of Chriſt hath been in Egyptian bondage, and in a great and terrible wilderneſs, ever ſince the beaſt aroſe out of the bottomleſs pit. Rev. xi. 2, 8. xii. 14. xiii. 5. The cauſe why many Chriſtians were for continuing circumciſion, after it was out of date, was the fear of perſecution for the croſs of Chriſt. But Paul ſaid, God forbid that I ſhould glory, ſave in the croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. For in Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a new creature. Gal. vi. 12—15. But infant baptiſm binds the church and world together, inſtead of crucifying any one to the world, and the world to him. Yet our author ſays of the Baptiſts, "They made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in Germany ſoon after the reformation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. But the preſent race of Baptiſts are happily very unlike the furious and blood-thirſty bigots who wore the name at that time."<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 47.</note> As if Chriſt and his diſciples had not been Baptiſts near fifteen hundred years before the reformation in Germany. And has any man ever been able to produce a mention of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptiſm before the third century? And in the next century, Conſtantine brought the ſword into the church to puniſh heretics, and to ſupport reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:030011_0110_0FE3BF0D307267A0"/>miniſters; and blood and ſlavery, deceit and cruelty, have followed thoſe ſuperſtitions ever ſince, though many good men have been enſnared in thoſe ways. In the year 1789 many Preſbyterians met at Philadelphia, and formed a tribunal which they called, "The General Aſſembly of the Preſbyterian Church, in the United States of America." And they opened a correſpondence with the General Aſſociation in Connecticut; and a delegate from thence to the Preſbyterian aſſembly at Philadelphia in May, 1793, ſaid in a letter to England the fall after, "There are nearly as many miniſters of our order in Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, as there are Preſbyterians in all the States to the ſouthward of Connecticut."<note n="*" place="bottom">Rippon's Regiſter, Vol. II, p. 131.</note> That is, in ten States, in which are nearly three million of people, they have but about two hundred Preſbyterian miniſters. How far then is the Congregational and Preſbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an denomination in America from riſing above all other Proteſtants, both here and in Europe?</p>
               <p n="3">III. And if we ſearch the ſcriptures, we ſhall find, that a being born again by the power of the Spirit of God, and a receiving ſpecial gifts from him for the miniſtry, is the only way that he hath revealed, for any to come into the church, and into the work of preaching the goſpel as they ought, let their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be what it may. Hence the firſt apoſtle ſays, As every man hath received the gift, even ſo min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter the ſame one to another, as good ſtewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the oracles of God; if any man min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth; that God in all things may be glorified through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.—The elders which are among you I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, who am alſo an elder, and a witneſs of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt, and alſo a partaker of the glory that ſhall be revealed; feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the overſight thereof, not by
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:030011_0111_0FE3BEC68E050CE0"/>conſtraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being enſamples to the flock. And when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, ye ſhall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. Likewiſe, ye younger, ſubmit yourſelves unto the elder; yea, all of you be ſubject one to another, and be clothed with humility; for God reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. I. Pet. iv. 10, 11. v. 1—5. Lordſhip is of the Gentiles, and they tread the holy city under foot forty and two months, or for a time, and times, and half a time, while the church is in the wilderneſs. Mark x. 42. Rev. xi. 2. xii. 14. Men trample upon the holy government, which Chriſt hath appointed in his church, as long as the power of the beaſt continues. And they ſay, Who is like unto the beaſt? who is able to make war with him?—They that dwell on the earth ſhall wonder (whoſe names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world) when they behold the beaſt that was, and is not, and yet is. Rev. xiii. 4. xvii. 8. Deceit and cruelty, under a maſk of religion and government, have changed into all ſhapes that can be conceived of; and who hath been like the preſent ſcheme? or who is able to war with the governing powers? are the great reaſons for complying with the eſtabliſhed worſhip, or at leaſt for not boldly appearing to renounce all the laws and inventions of men in the worſhip of God, and in the government of his church.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The Congregational miniſters in the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts meet in aſſociations when they pleaſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any act of their churches; and they act many things in private, and claim the whole power of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſing candidates for the miniſtry; and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut they alſo adviſe to the calling a conſociation in each county, when they think proper, to revoke acts of particular churches, or to cenſure ſuch miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:030011_0112_0FE3BF11C590F510"/>or churches as they judge to be guilty. They likewiſe chooſe delegates in each county, to meet once a year in a general aſſociation of miniſters by themſelves, from all parts of that State. But the Baptiſts had ſuffered ſo much from theſe meaſures, that they could not be perſuaded to meet in aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for many years, though upon quite a different plan. Yet in September, 1766, a number of elders and brethren agreed to ſend an invitation to their churches, to appoint a meeting the next year, to confer upon theſe things. And on September 8, 1767, ten churches met by delegation at Warren, with three miniſters from the Philadelphia Aſſociation, and a letter from thence on the ſubject. Moſt of thoſe who met thought they were not prepared to proceed then, but four churches were ready, and them formed an aſſociation, and named it from the town where they met; namely, the churches of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, Haverhill, Bellingham, and the ſecond in Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleborough. And as the annual commencement at our college is on the firſt Wedneſday in September, and ſome who come to it from a diſtance would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to attend the aſſociation alſo, it was appointed to be on the Tueſday after the commencement. They accordingly met at Warren, September 13, 1768, when four churches joined to this Aſſociation, as four more did at Warren, September 12, 1769. Their next meeting was at Bellingham, September 11, 1770, and they met again at Sutton, September 10, 1771, when they had increaſed to twenty churches, and 837 members; and they then began to print minutes of their proceedings, which they have done ever ſince. And the churches in the foregoing liſt who are now in the Warren Aſſociation, are the two in Boſton, thoſe in Bellingham, Haverhill, Warren, Middleborough, Charlton, Royalſtone, Wrentham, South-Brimfield, the firſt in Attleborough, Wilbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Woodſtock, and Freetown, thoſe in Chelmsford,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:030011_0113_0FE3BEC9C767F348"/>Harwich, Barnſtable, New-Salem, Leiceſter, Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, Harvard, Newton, Salem in New-Hampſhire, Cambridge, Northbridge, Providence, Glouceſter, Sturbridge, Aſhburnham, Templeton, Rowley, Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Bridgwater, Randolph, Marſhfield, Carver, Hollis, Hardwick, and Belcherton; extending over all the old colonies of Plymouth and the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setts, excepting what is weſt of Connecticut river, and into three adjoining States. This Aſſociation have begun to collect a fund for the purpoſe of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting pious young men in obtaining human learning, with a view to the goſpel miniſtry. Thirteen men were choſen by this Aſſociation, and were incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the legiſlature of the Maſſachuſetts in Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary, 1794, to manage a fund for this purpoſe. This Aſſociation are to fill up vacancies, when any happen, as long as the Aſſociation continues; and if it ſhould ever be diſſolved, the corporation are then to elect their own members, in perpetual ſucceſſion. They are inveſted with all neceſſary powers for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving eſtates, real or perſonal, until the income thereof ſhall amount to a thouſand pounds; and to uſe and improve the income of the fund for the aſſiſtance of ſuch young perſons in their education for the Baptiſt miniſtry, as the majority of the truſtees ſhall determine to be ſubjects thereof. A ſmall fund for this purpoſe is already collected, and all their generous friends are ſolicited to increaſe it, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſuch a uſeful inſtitution.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The benefits of the Warren Aſſociation ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo evident, that others were formed in many parts of the country. The Stonington Aſſociation began in 1772, which now includes three Baptiſt churches in Stonington, the firſt in Groton, New-London, and Saybrook, thoſe in Colcheſter, Montville, Chatham, Eaſt-Haddam, ſecond and third in Aſhford, the ſecond in Woodſtock, thoſe of Hampton, Plainfield, Exeter, Weſt-Greenwich, and two in Richmond, in the
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:030011_0114_0FE3BF17368970E8"/>States of Connecticut and Rhode-Iſland. Their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual meeting is on the third Tueſday of October. The New-Hampſhire Aſſociation began in 1776, and now includes the Baptiſt churches of Brentwood, Northwood, Gilmantown, Saliſbury, Madbury and Berwick, Sanford, Wells, Coxhall, one in Shapleigh, and Waterborough, Corniſh, and Fryeburgh, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acroſs the eaſt part of New-Hampſhire, and over the country of York in the Maſſachuſetts. Their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual meeting is on the ſecond Wedneſday in June. The Shaftſbury Aſſociation began in 1781, in which are now three churches in Shaftſbury, two in Cheſhire, thoſe of Pownal, Pittsfield, Cheſterfield, Hancock, Bullockſgrant, Stockbridge, Waſhington, firſt in Sandisfield and Great-Barrington, with Williamſton, in Vermont and the Maſſachuſetts, and twenty-five churches in the State of New-York. Their yearly meeting is on the firſt Wedneſday in June. The Woodſtock Aſſociation began in 1783, in which are now the churches of Woodſtock, Canaan, Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, Windſor, Hartford, Royalton, Sharon, That<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Norwich, Cambridge, Alburgh, Cheſter, Rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham, Weſtminſter, Wardſburgh, Weſtmoreland, Marlow, Maſon, Temple, Dublin, Newport, Alſtead, Corniſh, Wendal, Plainfield, Sutton, New-London, Hopkinton, and Grafton, in New-Hampſhire and Vermont, and one in Canada. Another connexion of churches was formed in thoſe parts in 1795, called, The Richmond Convention, of whom I have not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a particular account. The annual meeting of the Woodſtock Aſſociation is on the laſt Wedneſday of September. The Bowdoinham Aſſociation began in 1787, and it now contains the Baptiſt churches of Bowdoinham, Harpſwell, Bowdoin, Hebron, Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, Paris, Thomaſton, Vaſſalborough, Ballſton, Sidney, Readfield, Sterling, Muſcongus, Cuſhing, Lewiſton, Nobleborough, Greene and New-Sandwich, in the counties of Cumberland and Lincoln, in the
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:030011_0115_0FE3BECF41517E70"/>diſtrict of Maine. Their annual meeting is on the third Wedneſday in Auguſt. The Vermont Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion began alſo in 1787, and it contains the churches of Clarendon, Mancheſter, Middletown, Hubbard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Ira, Wallingford, Orwell, Pittsford, Brandon, Powlet, Shoreham and Georgia, in Vermont, with three in the State of New-York. Their annual meeting is on the firſt Wedneſday of October. The Meredith Aſſociation began in 1789, and it includes the churches of Meredith, Sandwich, Holderneſs, Rumney, Landaff and Bradford, Dartmouth, Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, Cockermouth, Sandburnton, Corinth and Verſhire, and Danville, in New-Hampſhire and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont. Their annual meeting is on the ſecond Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday in September. The Danbury Aſſociation began in 1790, and it includes the churches of Danbury, Suffield, Weſtfield, Canaan, Wallingford, Farming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Roxbury, Warren, Watertown, New-Hartfond, New-Milford, Sharon, one in Sandisfield, Colebrook, Eaſt-Hartford, Newtown, Litchfield, Stratfield, and three in the State of New-York. It extends from the ſouth borders of the Maſſachuſetts weſt of the great river acroſs Connecticut to the ſea. The churches of Ridgefield, Stamford and Greenwich, belong to Warwick Aſſociation in the State of New-York. The annual meeting of the Danbury Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is on the third Wedneſday of September. The Leyden Aſſociation began in 1793, in which are the churches of Leyden, Bernardſton, Richmond, Lev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erett, two in Guilford, Colerain, Putney, Somerſet, Dummerſton, Halifax, Buckland and Aſhfield, on the north ſide of the Maſſachuſetts, and on the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Vermont and New-Hampſhire. Their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual meeting is on the ſecond Wedneſday of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. As I failed of obtaining the laſt minutes of the Vermont, Meredith, and Leyden Aſſociations, their numbers ſtand as they were in 1794, the others as they were in 1795. If any miſtakes are
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:030011_0116_0FE3BF1BC9CBE388"/>diſcovered, and any man will point them out, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would account it a favour, and take the beſt way he can to correct them.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Theſe aſſociations refuſe to hear and judge of any perſonal controverſy in any church, or to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with the affairs of any church which hath not joined with them. When any church would join to any aſſociation, they ſend a letter and meſſengers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, informing when their church was conſtituted, the faith and order of it, and their number of members. If ſatisfaction is obtained, they are received by a vote of the aſſociation, and the moderator gives the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers the right hand of fellowſhip. And each church ſends a letter and meſſengers, or a letter at leaſt, to the aſſociation every year, to give an account of the ſtate of the church, and how many have been added, diſmiſſed, died, or have been excluded in the year paſt. If theſe things are neglected for a number of years, or if the church departs from her former faith or order, ſhe is left out of the aſſociation. By theſe means, mutual acquaintance and communion has been begotten and promoted; the weak and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed have been relieved; errors in doctrine and practice have been expoſed and guarded againſt; falſe teachers have been expoſed, and warnings againſt them have been publiſhed; deſtitute flocks have been occaſionally ſupplied; many have been animated and encouraged in preaching the goſpel through the land, and in our new plantations in the wilderneſs. And it is hoped that theſe duties will yet be more attended to, and that greater bleſſings will hereafter be granted. For our Lord ſaid to his diſciples, I have yet many things to ſay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit, when he the Spirit of truth is come he ſhall guide you into all truth. He had juſt before ſaid, The time cometh, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever killeth you, will think that he doeth God ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. John xvi. 2, 12, 13. And what is there that is
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:030011_0117_0FE3BED3CF050050"/>harder to bear than to hear of being killed for Chriſt's fake? Reviling and lying on the one hand, and worldly enticements and flatteries on the other, are much harder to ſtand boldly againſt than open vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, torture and death. For the earth helped the woman, when ſhe was enduring bloody perſecution, and the people forced her perſecutors to deſiſt from their cruel meaſures. But it is very hard to make the people believe, that we are ſuffering for the cauſe of Chriſt, when we refuſe to call in the power of the magiſtrate to ſupport religious miniſters, or to puniſh any who injure us on religious accounts. Yet God ſays, Avenge not yourſelves, but rather give place unto wrath, for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, ſaith the Lord. Rom. xii. 19. Deceit and cruelty hath ever prevailed more in the world, under the maſk of religion and government, than they poſſibly could in any other way. Therefore our Lord requires his miniſters to depart out of every city or houſe where they refuſe to receive his goſpel, and he ſays, Freely ye have received, freely give. Mat. x. 8, 15. But this command hath ever been violated, where teachers have been ſupported by the ſword of the magiſtrate. And the combination of teachers and rulers, in ſchemes of power and gain, under the name of Chriſtianity, hath filled the world with blood and ſlavery. And I believe that this combination is the beaſt and the falſe prophet, who will be caſt into the burning lake. Rev. xix. 11—21. For where miniſters are ſupported by the ſword, deceitful men are armed againſt the children of God. And where that power is renounced, many will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the miniſters of Chriſt to go a warfare at their own charges, becauſe he ſays, Freely ye have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, freely give. As if freedom belonged only to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters, while the people are ſlaves to their luſts. For God ſays, To whom ye yield yourſelves ſervants to obey, his ſervants ye are to whom ye obey; whether
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:030011_0118_0FE3BF212C35BBD8"/>of ſin unto death, or of obedience unto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Rom. vi. 16.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. But our aſſociations appeared to be ſo help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to guard againſt theſe evils, and to promote real religion, that the churches who held to mixed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion began a yearly meeting in 1785, under the name of, The Groton Conference. And it now includes the Baptiſt churches of Dartmouth, New-Bedford, two in Rehoboth, two in North-Kingſton, one in South-Kingſton, New-Shoreham, two in Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly, and one in each of the towns of Groton, Ston<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, Lyme, Saybrook, Sutton, Preſton and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, extending over part of three States. The church in Dighton, ſecond in Attleborough, and ſome others, have given up communion in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the ſupper with any who were only ſprinkled in infancy, and the reſt of thoſe churches appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to do the ſame, and to come into fellowſhip with our aſſociated churches. The old Baptiſt churches have revived their aſſociations, ſince the year 1774, though the ſecond churches in Swanſea and Newport do not attend them, nor the firſt in Cumberland. But the churches of Johnſton, Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, two in Rehoboth, two in Scituate, two in Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, two in Warwick, the firſt in the towns of Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Coventry, North-Kingſton, and Richmond, one in Eaſt-Greenwich, the ſecond in Cheſhire, and the third in Shaftſbury, are in that connexion. The Baptiſt churches who hold the ſeventh day of the week as the Sabbath, have alſo their annual meetings. Of theſe are the third church in Newport, the firſt in Hopkinton, the ſecond in New-London, and the church in Briſtol in Connecticut. There are a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber more of Baptiſt churches in various parts of our land who have not joined to any aſſociation, but they are coming into them from year to year, while many others are formed. I have alſo heard of a few Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt churches upon our eaſtern coaſts, who do not
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:030011_0119_0FE3BE52DD67D118"/>hold with other churches there about the doctrines of grace; but I have not obtained ſo diſtinct account of their affairs and connexions as may be ſerviceable to the public. The world is ſo full of controverſy, that all our powers ought to be engaged to promote truth and peace among all men. And for this end God ſays, Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor truſt in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate; laying up in ſtore for themſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life. For perverſe diſputings, profane and vain babblings, and oppoſitions of ſcience, falſely ſo called, all proceed from the love of money, which is the root of all evil. 1 Tim. vi. 5, 10, 17—20. The knowledge of the truth is ever the ſame, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry age, and every country; but the oppoſition of falſe notions of knowledge, hath filled the world with controverſy and confuſion. Further evidence of this will appear in the following hiſtory of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular churches, and of the oppreſſions which many have endured.</p>

               <p n="1">I. OUR fathers fled to America for religious puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and liberty, with a perſuaſion that each believer ſtands in the ſame relation to his children, as Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham did to his in the covenant of circumciſion. But ſoon after they came to Boſton, a difficulty aroſe about their children, who were grown up ſo as to have families, and yet were not true believers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo as to bring their children upon their own faith to baptiſm. The church in Dorcheſter wrote to the church in Boſton, to inquire whether a grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father might not bring ſuch infants? Mr. Cotton and his church concluded that he might, only with two cautions.
<list>
                     <item>"1. That the grandchild, baptized by right of the grandfather's covenant, be committed to the grandfather's education.</item>
                     <item>2. That the parents of the child, do not thereby take occaſion to neglect the due and ſeaſonable preparation of themſelves for entrance into covenant with God and his church."</item>
                  </list>
This was dated December 16, 1634, about four years after Boſton was planted. And on October 11, 1648, Mr. Cotton wrote to a friend in England, and
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:030011_0121_0FE3BED8C6685D98"/>ſaid, "Though they be not fit to make ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of viſible faith as to admit them to the Lord's table, yet they may make profeſſion full enough to receive them to baptiſm, or to the ſame ſtate Iſhmael ſtood in after circumciſion."<note n="*" place="bottom">Increaſe Mather on the firſt principles of New-England about baptiſm, 1675. p. 2, 3, 6.</note> But Iſhmael and Eſau were both excluded from the covenant of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion long before the paſſover was inſtituted, of which ſervants were obliged to partake, as well as all the children of Iſrael. And Mr. Henry Dunſtar, the firſt preſident of Cambridge college, ſaw their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in theſe things ſo clearly, that he boldly preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt infant baptiſm, and for believers' baptiſm, in the pulpit at Cambridge in 1653, the year after Meſſrs. Clarke, Holmes and Crandal were impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Boſton, only for worſhipping God by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without leave from the ruling powers in the Maſſachuſetts. But thoſe powers compelled Mr. Dunſtar to reſign his office in college; and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of their juriſdiction, and ſpent the reſt of his days, even five years, at Scituate in Plymouth colony.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In the year 1655, Thomas Gould, of Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, was ſo fully convinced that infants had no right to baptiſm, that he refuſed to bring his child thereto; but for this he was cenſured in the church and proſecuted in their courts, until ſome Baptiſts came to him out of England, and they formed a Baptiſt church there, May 28, 1665, and Gould became their paſtor. But the leaders of this church were fined and impriſoned, from time to time, until a ſentence of baniſhment was paſſed againſt Thomas Gould, William Turner, and John Farnum; and becauſe they would not baniſh themſelves, they were impriſoned at Boſton, in July, 1668, where they were confined about a year. But in the Indian war, ſeven years after, a company of thoſe Baptiſt were
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:030011_0122_0FE3BF2B0A7EEB90"/>ſent out againſt the enemy, and Turner was their captain, and ſacrificed his life for the government by whom he had been perſecuted. And in January, 1678, this church had increaſed ſo much, that they concluded to build them a meeting-houſe in Boſton, though with ſo much caution as not to let the ruling powers know what it was deſigned for, until they met in it, February 15, 1679. But in May follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a law was made, to forbid all perſons to erect or make uſe of any houſe for public worſhip, without licenſe from the ruling powers, upon penalty of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting the houſe and land, and all private ways lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it. And a ſynod was called in September, who gave it as their opinion, that ſuffering thoſe Baptiſts to meet for worſhip by themſelves, was a cauſe of the judgments of God upon the land; therefore their meeting-houſe was nailed up by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of court in March, 1680, and Dr. Increaſe Mather publiſhed a book againſt them the ſame month, in which he ſaid, "Antipedobaptiſm is a blaſted error."<note n="*" place="bottom">Divine Right of Infant Baptiſm, p. 20.</note> But he and his brethrein met with ſuch cruel oppreſſion ſoon after, as moved them to procure a ſpecial act, to exempt Boſton from any compulſive power for the ſupport of any religious miniſters. And he and his ſon Cotton Mather, with Mr. John Webb, went into the houſe which their party had nailed up, and aſſiſted in ordaining a Baptiſt miniſter, as a paſtor of that Baptiſt church. Mr. Gould was a paſtor of that church, from its beginning until his death about 1676; and he was ſuch an example of meekneſs, faith and patience as is ſeldom found. Mr. Iſaac Hull was called to the paſtoral office in that church in the time of their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and continued therein till 1689, and how much longer their records do not diſcover. Mr. John Ruſſell, who ſuffered impriſonment for the cauſe of conſcience, was ordained a paſtor of that church,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:030011_0123_0FE3BEDBE74BFF60"/>July 28, 1679, and he wrote a defence of their cauſe in 1680, which was printed in London, with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face by ſix noted miniſters there. But he was taken away by death, December 21, 1680, much lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his people; and his poſterity are numerous and reſpectable in theſe parts to this day. Their next miniſter was Mr. John Emblen, from England, who miniſtered to them from 1684, to 1699, or thereabouts. He appears to have been well eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them, as far as I could obtain any infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. After his death the church wrote again to England for a miniſter, but obtained only a reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful letter from thence. They wrote alſo to Mr. William Screven in South-Corolina, who had been of this church, but he could not leave his flock there. Therefore in 1708, they called Mr. Ellis Callender to be their miniſter, who had been a member of their church ever ſince 1669, and he continued in high eſteem among them until 1726.</p>
               <p n="3">III. His ſon, Mr. Eliſha Callender, was wrought upon by divine grace very early, and joined to that church on Auguſt 10, 1713; and he was educated in the univerſity at Cambridge, and was ordained a paſtor of that church, May 21, 1718, by the help of three Congregational miniſters in Boſton, before named. And this tranſaction, with his correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with friends in England, and other informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, moved Thomas Hollis, eſquire, of London, to become the greateſt benefactor to the univerſity at Cambridge of any one man in the world. Mr. Eliſha Callender was a very faithful and ſucceſsful miniſter of the goſpel, until he fell aſleep in Jeſus, March 31, 1738. Mr. Jeremy Condy was educated in the college at Cambridge, where he took his firſt degree in 1726; after which he went over to England, from whence he was called by this church, and was ordained their paſtor, February 14, 1739. But he had quite other ſentiments, concerning the nature and power of the
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:030011_0124_0FE3BE5BE4AE2EB8"/>goſpel, than thoſe of his predeceſſors; and he oppoſed the powerful work which came on in Boſton the year after he was ordained, and another church was formed in a way of ſeparation from him; and the firſt Baptiſt church in Boſton was in a declining condition, until they called and ſettled Mr. Samuel Stillman as their paſtor, January 9, 1765, when Mr. Condy reſigned his office, and lived a retired life, well eſteemed among his acquaintance, until he died, Auguſt 9, 1768, aged 59. A revival of religion began in that church in 1769, which cauſed the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of eighty members in three years, to a church which had not ſeventy members before. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational miniſters of Boſton were much alarmed at this increaſe of the Baptiſts, and publiſhed ſeveral things to guard againſt them, and to draw young people into their own communion. One of them had publiſhed a book againſt the work of God in 1743, when many were drawing off from uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted miniſters, and then he ſaid, "No man becomes a miniſter, or a communicant in our churches, until he hath been ſeverely examined about his <hi>regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as well as converſation." But he publiſhed another book in 1772, to guard againſt the Baptiſts, in which he ſaid, "The divinely appointed way, in which perſons become members of the viſible church of Chriſt, is utterly inconſiſtent with the ſuppoſition, that, in order to their being ſo, they muſt be the ſubjects of <hi>ſaving faith,</hi> or judged to be ſo." Our ſecond vol. p. 153, 269. Thus do men condemn themſelves. When the American war began in Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, this church was much ſcattered, and their paſtor removed to Philadelphia; and after his return and his brethren, earthly mindedneſs greatly prevailed, until the year 1785, when religion was again reviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which added fifty members more in three years. In 1790, a happy work of the Spirit of God was again granted in Boſton, and above ſeventy members
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:030011_0125_0FE3BEE122418418"/>were received into the firſt Baptiſt church there, in about two years, and their preſent number is 267, beſides all that have died, have been diſmiſſed, or excluded.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Another miniſter, who is a member of this church, is not to be forgotten. Mr. Peter Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropos Roots, A. M. was born at Symſbury in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, where his father was miniſter,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Benaiah Roots.</note> March 27, 1765. But as many of the people diſliked his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſearching preaching, he requeſted a diſmiſſion, which was granted, and he went and ſettled at Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in Vermont, where a happy work of grace was granted in 1783, when his ſon experienced a change of heart; and he was educated in Dartmouth col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, after which he was licenſed to preach in the Congregational way, in March, 1790. He had many ſcruples about infant baptiſm while he was at college, and they followed him afterwards, until he made them known to the moſt able miniſters of his own denomination, deſiring them to ſhew him a divine warrant for that practice, if they could, as he had no deſire to become a Baptiſt, if he could avoid it with a clear conſcience. But as they could not ſatisfy him, and he obtained full conviction, that a credible profeſſion of ſaving faith was a neceſſary qualification for baptiſm, he came to Boſton, and was baptized and joined to the firſt Baptiſt church there, June 3, 1792. And the church being ſatisfied with his qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifications for an itinerant miniſter, called others to aſſiſt in his ordination at Providence, September 4, 1792, the day before the commencement at the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity there; and in the winter following he travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and preached the goſpel through all the States as far as Georgia. And Mr. Roots has devoted himſelf to the work ever ſince, often preaching to deſtitute churches in various parts of our country, and he hath been received to preach in the pulpits
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:030011_0126_0FE3BF30806E5A00"/>of many Congregational miniſters, as well as in places where no ſteady worſhip had been maintained; and as inquiry was often made, why he embraced the Baptiſt principles, he publiſhed a book to give the reaſons thereof near the cloſe of 1794.</p>
               <p n="5">V. As the ſecond Baptiſt church in Boſton began in a way of ſeparation from the firſt, they gave them the following reaſons for it.
<floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <list>
                           <item>"1. We have for a conſiderable time been diſſatisfied with Mr. Condy's doctrine, being of opinion, from many diſcourſes which we have heard him deliver from the pulpit, and from converſation with him at ſeveral times, that he is what we call an Arminian, in that we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend he holds general redemption, is a free-willer, holds to falling from grace, and denies original ſin. We mean by his denying original ſin, that he ſoftens, moderates and explains away the guilt, malignity, corruption and depravity of human nature exactly as the high Arminian clergy forever do.</item>
                           <item>2. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that he denies the doctrines of election and predeſtination. If Mr. Condy does not deny theſe doctrines, we freely confeſs that we do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſcope or deſign of his ſermons, nor of his converſation when we have heard him diſcourſe on theſe points of our faith. He publickly owned at a church meeting, that he never had preached election, and believed he never ſhould; alleging as a reaſon for it, that if he ſhould preach up election, he ſhould offend the greater part of his church. This excuſe we look upon to be no ſufficient reaſon for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to inſtruct his people in this important doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, but it rather ought to have animated him, if he believed this doctrine himſelf, to ſet his church right in an article of ſuch importance. We hope we need not take up your time nor our own in prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it is the indiſpenſable duty of a faithful miniſter of Chriſt, to declare to his church the whole counſel of God, let who will be offended thereat;
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:030011_0127_0FE3BEE737CF1818"/>ſo that we conclude that Mr. Condy does not believe the doctrine of election himſelf.</item>
                           <item>3. We are enough diſſatisfied with his way of thinking on that great, that moſt ſolemn doctrine of regeneration. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we have heard him diſcourſe on the new-birth, his ſermons were ſo ill grounded, ſo intermixed with man's freewill agency, and ſo widely different from what our Lord taught and intended thereby, that we cannot avoid queſtioning whether he ever experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the ſaving operation of that moſt important doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine in his own ſoul.</item>
                           <item>4. We were ſufficiently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted at a declaration in one of his ſermons, That Chriſtians cannot know or diſtinguiſh the operation of the Spirit of God upon their ſouls, from the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of their own minds. This aſſertion we look upon to be of the moſt dangerous tendency; a ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the root and main evidence of the Chriſtian conſolation and hope.—We are now willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our former places with you, if we can find that your principles and practices are the ſame with thoſe on which, by the grace of God, our church was firſt founded. But if your articles of faith are in fact contrary to thoſe on which this church was firſt eſtabliſhed, you cannot, we think, juſtly blame us for ſeparating from you, and uniting with others who are like minded with ourſelves. The Lord give you underſtanding in all things, and may your hearts be directed into the love of God, and to be ready always to give an account of the hope that is in you, with meekneſs and fear. The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt be with you all.</item>

               <p n="6">VI. The two firſt of theſe men came formerly from England, the third from Wales, and the fourth was a ſchool maſter in Boſton. Mr. Ephraim Bound,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:030011_0128_0FE3BF3645451B18"/>ſon to James, met with a happy change in thoſe times, and was baptized by elder Moulton, of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, and he began to preach the goſpel in this new ſociety. And as they obtained no ſatisfaction from the old church, James Bound, John Procter, Ephraim Boſworth, John Dabney, Thomas Boucher, Ephraim Bound, and Thomas Lewis, formed a new church in Boſton, July 27, 1743, and elected Ephraim Bound as their paſtor. His human learning was not great, but his powers of mind, and his ſpiritual teaching, made him an excellent teacher and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the goſpel. But as moſt of the old Baptiſt miniſters and churches in our country were prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt the late revival of religion therein, theſe people found it difficult to obtain help in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their miniſter. Elder Wightman, of Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in Connecticut, was clear in that work, but he was advanced in years, and could not well travel ſo far as Boſton; therefore this church ſent ſome of their members to meet him in Warwick, where Mr. Bound was ordained, September 7, 1743, by the help of elder Wightman, and elder Greene, of Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter. And many ſubjects of the late work of grace in the land, joined to this church in Boſton, from Newton, Needham, Medfield, and other places. Deacon Ephraim Boſworth, of the town of Hull, having no children, gave this church a good eſtate, which they ſtill enjoy. Alſo in the month of Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary, 1749, this church received the following gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous donation from England; viz. From the Rev. John Gill, D. D. for the communion table, one large cup, four ſmaller ones, two diſhes and two plates, alſo one large rich damaſk table cloth. Alſo ſeven complete ſets of baptiſmal garments, namely, one for the miniſter, and three for men and three for wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; alſo books to the amount of about fifty dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. At the ſame time they received a further gift of forty eight volumes of the late Rev. Mr. Hill's
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:030011_0129_0FE3BE7CA06F8720"/>Sermons; (an Independent miniſter in London, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to Dr. Ridgley) Mr. Hill's ſermons were ſent by his father, the editor, to be given away at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the church. And after the great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake in 1755, Mr. Bound ſet up a weekly lecture, which was attended by many from all parts of the town; "and many owned him to be the inſtrument of their converſion, who yet joined to Pedobaptiſt churches; and he was greatly reſpected by people of various denominations, and eſpecially by his own ſociety. But in the midſt of his uſefulneſs, it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God to ſeize him with a paralytic diſorder, in the morning of December 17, 1762, from which he never recovered, though he revived ſo as to preach a few ſermons." Mr. Bound died, much lamented, though with great comfort in his own ſoul, June 18, 1765. This church had increaſed under his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to about 120 members; and as ſoon as he was taken ill, they not only obtained occaſional ſupplies from ſiſter churches, but alſo ſent for Mr. (now Dr.) Samuel Stillman, from New-Jerſey. He was born in Pennſylvania, and educated in South-Carolina, where he was ordained; but the climate not ſuiting his conſtitution, he came and preached for ſome time at Bordentown in the Jerſey, from whence he came to Boſton, and miniſtered a year to this church, and then, in September, 1764, he went to the firſt Baptiſt church in Boſton, in which he hath been a ſucceſsful miniſter to this day.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. The ſecond Baptiſt church in Boſton being again left deſtitute, ſought and obtained ſome help from ſiſter churches, and looked out for another paſtor, but could not obtain one in many years. Many of their old brethren were dead, and others were ſcattered into different parts of the land, ſo that they feared a diſſolution of their church. Such is the changing ſtate of things in this world, both as to our temporal and ſpiritual concerns; and happy are
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:030011_0130_0FE3BE6257C14898"/>they who humble themſelves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt them in due time. Mr. John Davis paid this church a viſit in the fall of 1769, and at their requeſt, he removed there from the State of Delaware in May, and was ordained their paſtor September 9, 1770. He was educated in the college at Philadelphia, and was a man of great powers of mind, which he exerted in a noble manner, in the cauſe of religious liberty, and for the welfare of our churches, until his health failed, which led him to aſk a diſmiſſion, which was granted, July 19, 1772, and he ſailed from Boſton in Auguſt, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near the Ohio, December 13, 1772, greatly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. Mr. Iſaac Skillman, who was born in New-Jerſey, and educated at Princeton college, was the third paſtor of this church, from September, 1773, to October, 1787, when he went back to New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, and is now the paſtor of the Baptiſt church at Salem in that State. Directly after his departure, this church called Mr. Thomas Gair to be their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who was born in Boſton, educated in the college at Providence, and ordained at Medfield, September 18, 1776, where he miniſtered to good purpoſe for ten years. But then, as ſome of their ableſt breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren were dead, and peculiar difficulties aroſe in the church, they diſmiſſed and recommended him; and his labours were much bleſſed in Boſton, until he was ſuddenly called away by death, April 27, 1790. And it is very remarkable that two paſtors of this church, Davis and Gair, each died in his 36th year, and were the only miniſters who had died out of the Warren Aſſociation ſince it was formed in 1767. In July after the deceaſe of the latter, the church ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a viſit from Mr. Thomas Baldwin, who was born at Norwich in Connecticut, December 23, 1753, and ordained at Canaan in New-Hampſhire, June 11, 1783, and preached with ſucceſs in thoſe parts until he was now called to Boſton, where he
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:030011_0131_0FE3BEEC7A941FD0"/>was inſtalled the paſtor of this church, November 11, 1790. They had but 42 members when Mr. Skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man came there in 1773, and when he left them they had increaſed to 66, and when Mr. Gair died they had 89, and now have 158.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Theſe churches in Boſton have equal liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with other denominations, and no man in that town has been compelled to ſupport any miniſter that he did not perſonally chooſe, ſince the year 1693; but this liberty is <hi>wickedly</hi> denied to the generality of our towns in the country, contrary to the promiſe of our delegates at Congreſs in 1774. Dr. Stillman preached the election ſermon at Boſton, May 26, 1779, when he clearly deſcribed the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween civil States, and the government of the church of Chriſt, ſhewing that they ought to be entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct. Yet in the conſtitution of our government, which was formed the winter following, church and ſtate are confounded together. He had publiſhed four ſermons in 1769, upon original ſin, the efficacy of divine grace in converſion, juſtification alone by faith in the perfect righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and the infinite importance of holy obedience to all the laws of Chriſt. This was in the beginning of a happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival of religion in Boſton. He hath alſo publiſhed ſeveral other ſermons and tracts ſince. Mr. Gair pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed an ordination ſermon, which he delivered at Cambridge in 1783; and alſo a circular letter in the minutes of the Warren Aſſociation. Mr. Baldwin publiſhed a diſcourſe in 1789, at the requeſt of the Woodſtock Aſſociation, to ſhew the reaſons why the Baptiſt churches refuſe to commune in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the ſupper with any who were only ſprinkled in infancy. Upwards of two years after, the Rev. Noah Worceſter, of Thornton, (N.H.) publiſhed an anſwer to him, wherein he ſet up godly ſincerity as the rule of communion, and not any external mode of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. To this Mr. Baldwin replied, in March, 1794,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:030011_0132_0FE3BF3B31F2D1C8"/>which was ſo much eſteemed, that it paſſed a ſecond edition in about two months. He proved plainly, that this controverſy all turns upon theſe two queſtions. 1. Who are the ſubjects of baptiſm according to the law of Chriſt? 2. What is the mode or manner of the baptiſm which he hath inſtituted? Mr. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter publiſhed another piece laſt winter, in which he refuſed to meet him upon this ground, ſaying, "The attempt would be to diſſolve the diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two denominations, rather than to open the way for a free communion between us, as two denominations. For I preſume, that, were we agreed upon theſe two queſtions, we ſhould not be two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations."<note n="*" place="bottom">Worceſter's Diſcuſſions, p. 8.</note> Very true; and why ſhould any be unwilling to have but one Lord, one faith, and one baptiſm? Yet this author hath now publiſhed above an hundred pages upon other things, while he refuſed to come to the point in hand.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Bellingham, in the county of Norfolk, was ſo abuſively treated by Congregational miniſters, that they have never ſettled one of them in that town in above forty years paſt. The Baptiſt church there, was conſtituted October 15, 1750; and Mr. Elna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than Wight was their firſt paſtor, who was ordained January 14, 1755, and was a faithful and uſeful min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter there, until he was taken away by death, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 6, 1761, aged 46. Mr. Noah Alden was born in Middleborough, May 31, 1725, converted there in 1741, and was ordained at Stafford in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, June 5, 1755. But he was diſmiſſed from thence, by the advice of a council, Auguſt 28, 1765, and he was inſtalled at Bellingham, November 12, 1766, and continues their paſtor to this day. Mr. Aaron Leland was raiſed up in this church, who is paſtor of the Baptiſt church at Cheſter, in Vermont. Peace hath generally been enjoyed in Bellingham, and they have been favoured with ſeveral revivals of
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:030011_0133_0FE3BE57377F5238"/>religion, though their church hath never been very large. And the like may be ſaid of the Baptiſt church in Wrentham, which was conſtituted in 1769. William Williams, A. M. was ordained their paſtor, July 3, 1776. He was born in Pennſylvania, and was educated in Rhode-Iſland college, being one of the firſt claſs therein, and he is now a fellow of that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration. He alſo keeps a Latin ſchool, in which many young gentlemen have been fitted for the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege. The Baptiſt church in Medfield was formed Auguſt 18, 1776, and Mr. Gair was ordained the paſtor the next month, as was before obſerved. In 1787 their church had increaſed to 81 members; but in 1789 they diſmiſſed 14 members to for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="10">X. The county of Plymouth, where our fathers began the ſettlement of New-England, calls for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> next attention. The principles and manners of the firſt planters of the country, are as much retained
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:030011_0134_0FE3BE66EDC1B308"/>here as in any part of the land. And this may be a cauſe why no perſon hath been hanged in the county of Plymouth for ſixty years paſt. The inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants are as much upon a level, and there are as few foreigners among them, as in any part of America. The people are generally ſupported by their own la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and not by the labour of others. And a powerful work of the Spirit of God in Middleborough, in and after 1741, prepared the way for the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the firſt Baptiſt church in the county, in this town. After the death of their miniſter in April, 1744, Judge Oliver, who came from Boſton, with a few more leading men in Middleborough, ſhut the next miniſter whom the church choſe, and two thirds of the people, out of their meeting-houſe, and from the uſe of their miniſterial lands. And when a new precinct was conſtituted in February, 1743, conſiſting part of Middleborough, and part of Bridgwater, the communicants therein were denied a diſmiſſion from the old churches for five years, leſt if a church were formed in this precinct, they ſhould call a miniſter whom the world did not like. The communicants therefore ſet up a meeting without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe from arbitrary miniſters, in December, 1747, and formed a church here, February 16, 1748, and ordained a paſtor therein the 13th of April follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But in the month between, their opponents held a pariſh meeting, and voted a large ſum of money, to finiſh their meeting-houſe, and to hire other ſort of preaching, and taxed the church and their miniſter, with the reſt of the inhabitants, to pay it. But after diſtreſs had been made upon ſeveral of them, it appeared in a trial at Plymouth court, that ſaid money was voted at an illegal meeting, and the caſe was turned againſt their collector. But they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to their ſuperior court, and in the mean time ſent an agent to Boſton, and obtained an act of the legiſlature to eſtabliſh ſaid meeting as legal, and the
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:030011_0135_0FE3BE81F17A13A0"/>ſuperior court gave judgment againſt the defendant upon this act, which was paſſed after the ſuit was commenced in the firſt executive court. And this ſhews that the temporal intereſt of no people can be ſecure, where one party of miniſters are ſupported by tax and compulſion.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. In Auguſt, 1749, a diſpute about baptiſm was brought into this church, which was managed with an unhappy temper by many, and cauſed great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties among the people. Nine members of this church, and one who was not a member, were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in September, and they ſet up a meeting from the church in October, becauſe their miniſter and church did not immediately become Baptiſts, ſo as to obtain an exemption from taxes to Congregational miniſters. They went the next year and joined to old Baptiſt churches, and obtained ſuch an exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe things, with the unhappy temper which many diſcovered, cauſed a great fear in others that there was ſome ſecret iniquity in the Baptiſt principles, as tradition had long ſaid there was. But they were led by degrees, to diſtinguiſh between the truth of God, and the corruptions of men who profeſs a zeal for it; and their miniſter was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in Auguſt, 1751, and others afterwards, who yet held communion with thoſe who were only ſprinkled in infancy, until they were convinced that this was a practical ſaying that they were baptized when they believed in their conſciences they were not. Therefore they formed a Baptiſt church here, January 16, 1756, and their former miniſter was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled their paſtor the 23d of June following, in which office he is ſtill continued. He was born at Norwich in Connecticut, January 9, 1724, convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in 1741, and began to preach in September, 1746. This was then the only Baptiſt church in an extent of country of above an hundred miles long, from Bellingham to the end of Cape-Cod, and near fifty
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:030011_0136_0FE3BE8809E19250"/>miles wide, between Boſton and Rehoboth. Their number was ſmall for many years, though they had ſome revivings from time to time, until ſuch a work came on in 1779, as increaſed their number in three years, from 59 to 138. And in forty years they have buried 34, diſmiſſed 61, and excluded 12, while 91 remain. Seven members of this church have been ordained to the work of the goſpel miniſtry, namely, James Mellen, Abner Lewis, Aſa Hunt, Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah Codding, Job Macomber, Samuel Nelſon, and David Leonard; the laſt of whom was ordained as an itinerant, December 17, 1794. He was born in Bridgwater, and educated at the college in Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, where he took his firſt degree in 1792. His brother Zenas Lockwood Leonard graduated at that college in 1794, and was ſoon approbated by this church to preach the goſpel, and has been accepted in that work in various parts of the country. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Smith Nelſon was a claſs-mate with him, and he was approbated as a goſpel preacher by this church laſt May. He is great-grandſon to the firſt Baptiſt in Middleborough, of whom we ſhall ſay more preſently. The paſtor of this church publiſhed a diſcourſe upon an internal call to preach the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, in 1754; and he has publiſhed the moſt ſince of any Baptiſt in America; but their value is left entirely to the judgment of the public.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. The ſecond Baptiſt church in Middleborough was formed in the following manner. Thomas Nelſon, who was born here in June, 1675, diſcovered ſuch evils in the ſecond miniſter of the town, as cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to examine the ſcriptures concerning their principles; and finding nothing therein for infant baptiſm, he went and joined to the firſt Baptiſt church in Swanſea. And in the year 1717 he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into the ſouth part of Middleborough, called Aſſawamſet, being the firſt Engliſh family who ſettled there. And Baptiſt miniſters frequently preached at
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:030011_0137_0FE3BEEFE3F78CD0"/>his houſe, until he got one to preach there ſteadily, in the ſpring of 1753. This was Mr. Ebenezer Hinds, who was born in Bridgwater, July 29, 1719, and began to preach in 1749. About four miles ſouth weſtward from this meeting, in a place called Beechwoods, Mr. James Mead was ordained the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of a ſeparate church, October 3, 1751, and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in that office until he died, October 2, 1756. The majority of that church became Baptiſts ſoon after, and joined with Mr. Hinds's hearers in forming a Baptiſt church, November 16, 1757, and he was ordained their paſtor, January 26, 1758.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Hinds was baptized by Mr. E. Moulton, and joined himſelf to the ſecond Baptiſt church in Boſton, March 3, 1751.</note> They purchaſed a houſe and farm for the miniſtry, and built a convenient meeting-houſe 42 miles from Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Mr. Nelſon died before this church was conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, aged eighty, but his widow lived to commune with them in the ordinance of the ſupper, after ſhe was an hundred years old. She died December 7, 1782, being an hundred and five years and ſeven months old; and ſhe had then living of her poſterity 337, as near as the account could be collected; for ſome of them were in Nova-Scotia. William, Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel and Ebenezer Nelſon, three of her grandſons, are now ordained Baptiſt miniſters. Mr. Hathway, a miniſter in Freetown, alſo ſprang from this church. Such a revival of religion was granted among them in 1773, as increaſed the church to 104 members the next year. But a number of them were diſmiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to form a church in Freetown ſoon after, and they never have been ſo large ſince. Mr. Hinds hath had two wives, and fifteen children, of whom he hath buried eight; and the great expenſes in his family, with different ſentiments about the ſupport of miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the government of the church, hath cauſed many contentions among them, which hath reduced the church to a much ſmaller number than they once had; yet he is ſtill continued in his office there.</p>

XIII. The third Baptiſt church in Middleborough ſprang chiefly from the firſt. The lands near the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Middleborough, Rocheſter, Wareham, and Carver, were but little cultivated until 1754; and Baptiſt miniſters were called to preach there from time to time afterwards, and perſons from thence joined to our church, until they obtained a diſmiſſion, and ten perſons were formed into a church there, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 4, 1761. Mr. Ebenezer Jones had preached to them for a while before, and he was ordained their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor the 28th of October following. And a revival of religion came on among them the next ſpring, which prevailed through the year, and ſpread its happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into many other ſocieties, the good fruits whereof are viſible to this day. Yet ſome evil beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in Mr. Jones's wife, which drew him into a ſnare, cauſed a great diviſion in the church and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in 1763, which terminated in his removal from them; and he travelled and preached in various parts of our land, until he died in the county of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany, in September, 1791. This church was in a furnace of affliction for ſeveral years; but in the ſpring of 1770, they obtained Mr. Aſa Hunt to preach to them, and he was ordained their paſtor, October 30, 1771. He was born in Braintree, in July, 1744, and preached in Raynham for a year before he went to them, when he joined to the firſt Baptiſt church in Middleborough. His preaching was very acceptable, and they gave him a good place for a ſettlement, beſide the uſe of the miniſterial lot; and they built a convenient meeting-houſe, above eleven miles from the firſt Baptiſt meeting in this town. And ſuch a work of the Spirit of God began among them in March, 1780, as cauſed the addition of 113 members to their church by September, 1782, when they had 194 in all. But in the time of great changes in our country about money and worldly property, Mr. Hunt entangled himſelf ſo much in
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:030011_0139_0FE3BEF593945048"/>the affairs of this life, as cauſed much unhappineſs, and he inſiſted upon a diſmiſſion from his church, which they granted, though with reluctance, in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, 1789. He had been a journey into Virgin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ia, where he preached to good purpoſe the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and he travelled into New-Jerſey and Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia after his diſmiſſion; but he never removed his family, until he was called to viſit his eldeſt ſon, who was ſick with the dyſentery in the college at Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, where the father was ſeized with the ſame diſtemper, and died there, September 20, 1791. His ſon recovered, while he was taken away, and his memory is precious to many, notwithſtanding his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections. The church was in low circumſtances for ſome time, and young people got to be ſo extrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agant in vanity, that they could hardly be kept civil in times of public worſhip. But the church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with Mr. Samuel Nelſon to remove there to preach to them, in May, 1793. And in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the next month, ſuch a divine influence was granted, that old Chriſtians became all alive in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſuch a concern for the ſoul and eternity appeared among old and young through all the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt time in the ſummer, that they had frequent and crouded meetings, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt diſturbance from vain perſons, which before were ſo troubleſome. Mr. Nelſon was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained their paſtor January 16, 1794; and above thirty were added to their church in about a year.

A few perſons in the weſt part of Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water had been members of the firſt Baptiſt church in Middleborough near thirty years, before a happy revival of religion began there in 1779, when their number increaſed ſo much that they were encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hold meetings among themſelves, from time to
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:030011_0140_0FE3BF4461103008"/>time, until ſixteen members were diſmiſſed, and a church was formed there, June 7, 1785. Mr. George Robinſon had preached to them for a year before, and he became their paſtor. He was born in Attleborough, in November, 1754, and was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Killingly in Connecticut, November 13, 1776, where he miniſtered for more than ſeven years. But ſuch difficulties then aroſe in their church, partly occaſioned by the public diſorders in our country, that they called a council, and, by their advice, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed and recommended him, and he removed to Bridgwater, where many bleſſings have been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under his miniſtry. Mr. Seth Howard was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized there, March 10, 1779, and was one of the firſt members of this church, and he continued in their communion, until he died in a joyful manner, October 11, 1794, aged near 92. Mr. Eleazar Snow, who was born in Bridgwater, July 25, 1701, alſo joined to the firſt Baptiſt church in Middlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, and was then one of the firſt members of this church, and is now the oldeſt man in Bridgwater.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. SNOW, full of divine conſolation, died Feb. 18, 1796.</note>

Some perſons of Marſhfield joined to the firſt Baptiſt church in Boſton, before elder Callender died in 1738, and others joined to their ſecond church in elder Bound's time; but their number was ſmall, until deacon Joſiah Eames invited Baptiſt miniſters to preach there in 1773, and a meeting was ſet up, in which Thomas Eames began to preach. But theſe men removed away, and the laſt of them is now paſtor of a church in Iſleſborough in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Hancock; and the Baptiſts in Marſhfield were in low circumſtances, until a revival was granted in 1786, and they built them a meeting-houſe the next year, and a church was formed among them, June 11, 1788. They received aſſiſtance from neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring miniſters, from time to time, until Mr. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Butterfield came to preach there ſteadily in the fall of 1791, and he was ordained their paſtor, May 16, 1792. His gifts were promiſing, and his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:030011_0141_0FE3BF6E4F07D6E0"/>increaſed for ſome time; but from imprudent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, he proceeded to the uſe of deceitful means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a temporal living. Therefore a mutual council was called, May 8, 1793, who adviſed the church to depoſe him from his office, which they did, and he confeſſed it to be juſt. He was then forgiven and reſtored as a brother, and recommended to another church, and he removed to Weſton, and lately into the diſtrict of Maine. They have experienced many trying things ſince at Marſhfield, but it is hoped that all will work for their ſpiritual good.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. The town of Carver was formerly the ſouth pariſh in Plymton, betwixt Middleborough and Plymouth. Their firſt meeting-houſe was built near the north end of the pariſh, becauſe moſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple lived there. But when the ſouth end was alſo planted and cultivated, the inhabitants claimed a right of having it removed into the centre; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this was denied them, they built another meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe towards the ſouth end, and obtained occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional preaching in it for ſome years. At length they got Baptiſt miniſters to preach there, and their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples prevailed, until a Baptiſt church was formed there, July 13, 1791, and Mr. John Tripp was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained their paſtor the 28th of September following. Moſt of the firſt members were diſmiſſed from the third Baptiſt church in Middleborough, as others have been ſince. And a happy revival of religion in both churches in 1793, cauſed a large increaſe of this church. Mr. Tripp preached an ordination ſermon at Barnſtable, April 29, 1795: which was printed ſoon after at Boſton.</p>
               <p>In January, 1793, a great revival of religion began in Plymouth, the firſt town that was planted in New-England; and it prevailed to a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree than any work of the Spirit of God hath done there ſince the year 1742. Their miniſter, the Rev. Dr. Robbins, was much engaged in it, and in the ſummer of 1794, he baptized one woman by immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which was a new thing in that town.</p>

               <p n="1">I. THE firſt Baptiſt church in the Maſſachuſetts is in Swanſea, which was originally in Plymouth colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the firſt in New-England. Mr. John Miles was a father of the Baptiſt churches in Wales, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in 1649; and he was paſtor of the Baptiſt church of Swanſea in that country, until he was ejected from thence by a cruel act of parliament, which turned above two thouſand teachers out of their places in 1662. He then came over to our country, and brought their book of records with him, which is in Swanſea to this day, containing many things concerning the firſt Baptiſt churches in Wales, that are no where elſe to be found, and which have been lately tranſcribed and ſent over to them. Nicholas Tanner, Obadiah Bowen, John Thomas, and others, alſo came over to this country; and one of Bowen's poſterity is now Chancellor of the univerſity at Providence. A Baptiſt church was formed in Rehoboth in 1663, and Mr. Miles was their paſtor; and four years after they obtained a grant of the town of Swanſea, from the legiſlature at Plymouth; and there have been none but Baptiſt churches in that town to this day. Mr. Miles often viſited and laboured with his brethren at Boſton, in the time of their ſufferings; and he continued the
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:030011_0143_0FE3BF4999B3C1F8"/>faithful paſtor of the church in Swanſea, until he fell aſleep there, in a good old age, February <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hull and Emblen of Boſton; and he was much eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed at home and abroad, until he died in 1717, and his poſterity are numerous to this day. Mr. Ephraim Wheaton, who lived within the bounds of Rehoboth, had been a colleague with him about thirteen years, and he was a faithful and ſucceſsful miniſter until he died, April 26, 1734, aged 75. He baptized and received fifty members into his church in five years after a revival began in 1718, of which he wrote an account to Mr. Hollis in London. Our ſecond vol. p. 79. Mr. Samuel Maxwell was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a colleague with him, April 18, 1733; but he was unſteady in his ſentiments, and in 1738, he embraced the opinion of keeping the ſeventh day of the week as the Sabbath, which cauſed his diſmiſſion from this church. April 15, 1739. Elder Benjamin Herrington, formerly of Narraganſet, was their near paſtor, and was inſtalled in this church, Auguſt 18, 1742, and he had a crouded audience for ſeveral years; but then he was accuſed of the ſin of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and he went off to Canterbury in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, where he preached to a few people, and lived in obſcurity to old age. In March, 1748, Mr. Jabez Wood, of Middleborough, was called to preach to this church, and he was ordained their paſtor, Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 5, 1751. He was grandſon to Mr. Thomas Nelſon; but as the old gentleman judged that Wood had made uſe of unjuſt and deceitful meaſures to obtain that place, where was a good farm for the miniſtry, he removed his memberſhip to the firſt Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt church in Rehoboth, and others went to other churches; and the firſt church in Swanſea was in a
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:030011_0144_0FE3BF5AD9AC4400"/>declining condition, until elder Wood aſked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a diſmiſſion in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But as the enemy had burnt their meeting-houſe, and houſe for the miniſtry at Warren, three miles off, in May, 1778, the two churches agreed for the preſent to meet at Swanſea, and elder Thompſon was received into this church, October 7, 1779, and has been their paſtor ever ſince. And ſuch a rain of righteouſneſs was granted there in 1780, as cauſed the addition of above ninety members to that church in two years, and they have had other revivals ſince.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond church in Swanſea was formed upon different principles from the firſt, and they held the laying on of hands upon every member as a term of communion, and did not ſing in their public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Men who removed from Providence, and from other places, ſet up worſhip by themſelves there about 1680, and continued it until they formed a church, and Mr. Thomas Barnes was ordained their paſtor in 1693; and he was well eſteemed in his place, until he died, June 8, 1706. Samſon Maſon was a ſoldier in Cromwell's army, and he came over to America upon the turn of times in England, and ſettled in Rehoboth, and his poſterity are now as nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous as, perhaps, thoſe of any man who came to our country in his day, and they have had the chief lead in this church. His ſons were Noah, Samſon, James, John, Samuel, Joſeph, Iſaac, Pelatiah and Benjamin. James and John went to Boſton, but ſix of the others lived in Rehoboth and Swanſea, until the youngeſt of the ſix was ſeventy years old. Iſaac Maſon was ordained a deacon in this church, at the ſame time that Barnes was ordained their paſtor, and he lived to January 25, 1742. His brother Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph was ordained their paſtor in July, 1709, and continued ſo till he died, May 19, 1748. Mr. John Peirce was ordained a colleague with him, October
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:030011_0145_0FE3BF4E79F478B8"/>19, 1715, and died September 8, 1750, being each of them near ninety, and their memory is precious to their poſterity. Mr. Pelatiah Maſon was born in March, 1669, and died in March, 1763, and three of his ſons have been paſtors of this church. Elder Job Maſon was born February 28, 1695, ordained May 22, 1738, and died July 17, 1775. His character as a judicious man, a good preacher, and an exemplary walker, was high among his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. Elder Ruſſel Maſon was born April 22, 1714, ordained November 2, 1752, and is now able to preach frequently, and to diſcharge other duties of his office to the acceptance of his brethren. Elder John Maſon was born in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1716, ordained March 26, 1788, and is well eſteemed in his office. In the mean time, as their church has greatly increaſed in latter years, and they had many who joined to it from diſtant places, and gifted men were raiſed up among them, they ordained many elders. Elder Benjamin Maſon was ordained September 15, 1784, elder Nathaniel Cole, December 12, 1787, and elder Philip Slade, October 15, 1788. Elder Cole is now ſettled in Connecticut, while the others remain in this church in Swanſea. It is alſo to be obſerved, that a church in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboth ſprang from this church in 1753, and a large part of another church ten years after to go to Nova-Scotia. When all North-America was ced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Great-Britain, Nathan Maſon and his wife, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Lewis and his wife, Oliver Maſon and his wife, with Experience Baker, of this church, and Benjamin Maſon and his wife, Charles Seamans and his wife, Gilbert Seamans and his wife, from other churches, were formed into a church, and Nathan Maſon was ordained their paſtor, April 21, 1763, and they went and ſettled at the head of the Bay of Fundy. But after ſome years they removed back to New-England, and moſt of them went and ſettled in Berkſhire in
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:030011_0146_0FE3BF6B1974F7C0"/>the Maſſachuſetts. It is alſo to be obſerved, that the powerful work of grace which was wrought in this country, under the miniſtry of men who held to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptiſm, and who had oppreſſed the Baptiſts, was attended with ſuch evil reports as prejudiced the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts againſt the work for many years. But ſome miniſters from New-Jerſey came and preached among the Baptiſts in theſe parts, in and after 1754, which ſerved to remove thoſe prejudices, in ſome meaſure. And in 1756, colonel Andrew Cole, of Swanſea, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited ſome of our new miniſters to preach at his houſe, and from time to time afterwards. And though theſe Baptiſt churches had received members by a general confeſſion of their faith, yet in a great revival which began in the fall of 1771, a particular relation of experiences of an inward change of heart was introduced, which produced powerful effects upon many. Several hundred perſons were added to the Baptiſt churches in Swanſea and Rehoboth within two years after. The work was ſtill greater in and after 1780, and ſinging in public worſhip was ſoon after introduced into the ſecond church in Swan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea. But as they ſtill held laying on of hands as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>m of communion, a number drew off, and formed another church, and ordained Mr. Michael Eddy as their paſtor, in Auguſt, 1785; though it is ſince diſſolved, and he removed to Newport in 1790, where he is ſtill uſeful.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Rehoboth is a large town, extending from Taunton and Dighton to Providence, about twelve miles; and in 1791, there were 4710 perſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and ten religious ſocieties, which is more than we have in any other town of their numbers in theſe parts. Cruel oppreſſion, on the one hand, and an abuſe of liberty, on the other, have been the cauſe of it. Many had joined with the Baptiſts in Swanſea, from time to time, until Mr. John Comer came and aſſiſted in forming a church in Rehoboth. Some
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:030011_0147_0FE3BF51DC6F57B8"/>account of him is in our ſecond volume, p. 66, 110—113, 121—124. He was an excellent preacher of the goſpel, and an eminent inſtrument of reviving doctrinal and practical religion in Newport, for ſix years before he removed to Rehoboth in Auguſt, 1731, and a Baptiſt church was formed there, Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary 20, 1732, and he became their paſtor, and it increaſed to 95 members in leſs than two years. And in that time he went and laboured in Sutton, Leiceſter, Middleborough, and other places. But he exerted his powers ſo much in this noble cauſe, that he fell into a conſumption, and died joyfully, May 23, 1734, before he was thirty years old. His ſon is now a member of the Baptiſt church in War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and he lent me his father's diary, and other writings, which have been very ſerviceable in our hiſtory. Nathaniel Millard was ordained the ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> miniſter of this church, June 24, 1736. But his principles and conduct were corrupt, and he w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> diſmiſſed in 1742, after which he went off with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other woman inſtead of his wife. And as Mr. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well had retracted his opinion concerning the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, this church called him to be their paſtor, in October, 1745. But in about three years, Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational miniſters, who had oppreſſed the Baptiſts, had invited him to preach for them, and he yielded ſo much to them that this church diſmiſſed him, and he publiſhed a complaint about it in 1749. He oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en preached in other places, and was eſteemed as a pious man, and lived to a great age, but never had the charge of any other church. In the mean time, a ſecond Baptiſt church was formed in the northeaſt part of Rehoboth, and Mr. Richard Round was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained their paſtor, July 13, 1743; and in nine years it increaſed to forty members. He was one of the ſeals of Mr. Comer's miniſtry, and preached the goſpel faithfully, until his health failed, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to the ſouth part of the town, for the benefit
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:030011_0148_0FE3BF660E4AEF80"/>of the ſea air. And about that time a diviſion took place in both churches, and a part of both joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at their firſt place of worſhip, and elder Round was their paſtor until he died, May 18, 1768, aged 62. His character as a miniſter of the goſpel, and as a pious man, was very good; but thoſe churches are ſince diſſolved.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Mr. John Hicks was born in Rehoboth, May 10, 1712, and became a member of the firſt Baptiſt church there, and then a preacher therein, until they gave him a call to be their paſtor; but he did not accept it, becauſe many of the church appeared to him to be unſound in principle, and to oppoſe the power of godlineſs. But after much labour, a new church was formed, and Mr. Hicks was ordained their paſtor, November 10, 1762; and in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious year 1780, they had 106 members. Mr. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel Round, brother to Richard, was a member of this church, and called to preach the goſpel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and on May 11, 1768, he was ordained as a miniſter of the goſpel, to go and labour in Nova-Scotia, with a people who went from theſe parts. He went accordingly, and was a ſucceſsful labourer there for ſeveral years, and then he removed back, and ſettled in the eaſt part of Attleborough, and preached occaſionally round the country, until he died at home, July 18, 1781, in the 64th year of his age. Another church was raiſed out of the other, in the following manner. A powerful work began among them in the fall of 1771, and elder Hicks baptized forty perſons, and then was taken ſick in the winter, and Mr. Wincheſter came and baptized twenty more; and ſuch power appeared to attend his miniſtry, that many were taken with the opinion, that baptiſm by immerſion ought not to be held as a term of communion in the church. A council was called upon it, in September, 1772, and they who were not convinced by them, formed another church,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:030011_0149_0FE3BF6044936AD0"/>and ordained Mr. Jacob Hicks as their paſtor, Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary 20, 1773. He is the eldeſt ſon of their old paſtor, and was born January 1, 1740 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Elder John Hicks is now ſo old and infirm as not to be able to preach, but he appears ſtill ſtedfaſt in the faith and hope of the goſpel. His ſon hath none i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For as they communed with thoſe who were only ſprinkled in infancy, becauſe they loved them as Chriſtians, and not becauſe they viewed them as baptized perſons according to the written word, they have found this to be an impediment in the way of enforcing the written word as a rule in other caſes. And to receive any member, to the grief of any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the church, they alſo find to be unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Another ſuch church was formed on the north borders of Rehoboth, after a happy revival of religion there October 2, 1777; and Mr. James Sheldon, of Providence, was ordained their paſtor, September 6, 1780. And he purchaſed a good fare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> for ſixteen hundred dollars; but after he had paid a thouſand of it, he was preſſed upon for the reſt, in the trying year 1786, in ſuch a manner as to compel him to ſell it again, with the loſs of about ſeven hundred dollars. And there was reaſon to conclude, that a hope of his removal from that people, and of breaking up of that meeting, cauſed the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional party to preſs harder in this caſe, than they otherwiſe would have done. But be that as it may, elder Sheldon removed his family back to where he had formerly lived, though he often came and miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:030011_0150_0FE3BFC76934B0D8"/>to this people for ſeveral years, and then he obtained a diſmiſſion, and removed into the State of New-York in 1792. This church have obtained occaſional ſupp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

He was born in Glouceſter, above Providence, October 14, 1765. In the eaſt part of Rehoboth, a Baptiſt church was formed, January 17, 1780, in which were a number of very reſpectable members; but as they never obtained a paſtor, they now often go to other meetings. Two Baptiſt churches have alſo been formed in Rehoboth, who refuſed to commune with any baptized perſons, but thoſe who had laying-on of hands and prayer after baptiſm. They likewiſe excluded ſinging in their public worſhip, as moſt of the old Baptiſts in New-England did, before our great reformation. In order to form the firſt of theſe churches, above thirty perſons were diſmiſſed from the ſecond church in Swanſea, and formed a church in Rehoboth, and ordained Mr. Daniel Martin as their paſtor, Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry 8, 1753; and Mr. Nathan Peirce was ſoon or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a colleague with him. Mr. Martin publiſhed a diſcourſe in 1770, againſt particular election, and efficacious grace in converſion. But an anſwer to him was publiſhed the next year, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing to many minds. Elder Martin died in an advanced age, November 17, 1781, and elder Peirce died in 1794. Elder Thomas Seamans had been a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league with him for a number of years, and he ſtill miniſters to that people, but their number is ſmall. Another church ſprang from them, in the northeaſt corner of Rehoboth, and was formed on April 4, and two elders were ordained therein April 20, 1789, viz. the elders Aaron Wheeler and Sylveſter Round. The doctrines of grace, and the power of godlineſs, have lately gained ground among them.</p>

V. Mr. Elhanan Wincheſter was born in Brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyne, near Boſton, September 19, 1751, and was very ſtudious from a child; and he obtained a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable meaſure of human learning, before he made a profeſſion of religion, was baptized, and began to preach with much zeal. And his preaching in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboth cauſed a ſeparation in Mr. Peck's church, and another church was formed, and he was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their paſtor, September 4, 177<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, before he was twenty years old. And though he was baptized himſelf, yet he was exceeding zealous for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of all Chriſtians together, let them be ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in infancy or baptized by immerſion; and as his preaching appeared to be very powerful and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, it cauſed a diviſion in elder Hicks's church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned. But ſoon after Mr. Wincheſter was ordained, a Baptiſt miniſter pointed out to him the inconſiſtency of his conduct in ſuch a manner, that, after eight months' conſideration, he declared to his church, that he could no more adminiſter the ordinance of the ſupper to any who were only ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in infancy, though he was ſtill willing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge all the duties of his office to them that he could do with a good conſcience. But upon this the majority of his church refuſed to let him preach another ſermon among them; and they ſoon after cenſured him for not fulfilling his firſt covenant with them. Yet they called their way large communion, and the Baptiſt way cloſe communion. This church ordained Mr. Jonathan Chaffee as their paſtor, in May, 1778, but their church has decreaſed until it is now nearly diſſolved. Mr. Wincheſter called a council of Baptiſt churches in December, 1772, who adviſed him to confeſs his imprudent conduct to that church, and then to offer himſelf as a member <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſome Baptiſt church. He did ſo, and was received into the church in Bellingham; after which he travelled and laboured abundantly, through all the
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:030011_0152_0FE3BFCCE16C1B48"/>country, as far as South-Carolina. But in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of 1781 he was rejected by the Baptiſt church in Philadelphia, becauſe the fathers of it diſcovered that he had fallen into the doctrine of univerſal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. He had preached there but a few months, but in that time he had admitted many members, by which means his party became the majority; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſued for the meeting-houſe, and the houſe for the miniſtry, with other property which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that church. Though after much coſt in courts, for ſeveral years, they were defeated, and the property ſecured to the original church. After this, he came and ſpent a year in New-England, without viſiting many of his old friends, and then returned to Philadelphia, from whence he ſailed for England, in July, 1787. In London he publiſhed a book, in which he ſaid, "I have, at the expenſe of character and popularity with <hi>the religious world,</hi> at the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of <hi>temporal intereſt</hi> and emolument, and refuſing no other ſacrifice, in what I apprehended to be the cauſe of God and truth, come forth as a writing witneſs on this ſubject; and a defender of the faith which once I deſtroyed."<note n="*" place="bottom">Preface to Wincheſter's Dialogues, 1788, p. 6, 7.</note> Though it is well known, that he concealed his opinion upon that ſubject as long as he could, and that he graſped at the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral property of ſaid church as long as he could hope for it. And what is the faith which he would now defend? Why he ſays, "<hi>Puniſhment,</hi> without having the reformation and ſubjection of rebels for its end, is unworthy of the Being we adore." Again he ſays, "Since <hi>goodneſs</hi> is the perfection of God, and <hi>evil</hi> the imperfection of the creature, there can be no doubt, that as good exiſted before evil, ſo it ſhall exiſt to all eternity, when evil ſhall be no more."<note n="†" place="bottom">Dialogues, p. 23, 32, 33.</note> But how can any man believe, that the puniſhment which God has inflicted upon the fallen angels, for
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:030011_0153_0FE3BF78EFD6D768"/>near ſix thouſand years, is deſigned for their final ſalvation? Yea, or that the deſtruction of unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the wilderneſs, or of the Sodomites by fire from heaven, was deſigned for their endleſs happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? How can any government or dominion be ſupported upon theſe principles? And as God was infinitely good, before he created angels or men, how do we know that he will not reduce them all back again to nothing? For he created all things good, and the ſerpent perſuaded our firſt mother, that death and ruin could not come from eating the forbidden fruit. And one apoſtle ſays to Chriſtians, I fear leſt by any means, as the ſerpent beguiled Eve through his ſubtilty, ſo your minds ſhould be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt. 2. Cor. xi. 3. And another ſays, I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord having ſaved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterwards deſtroyed them that believed not. And the angels which kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their own habitation, he hath reſerved in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting chains under darkneſs, unto the judgment of the great day. Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over to fornication, and going after ſtrange fleſh, are ſet forth for an example, ſuffering the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of eternal fire. Likewiſe alſo theſe filthy dreamers defile the fleſh, deſpiſe dominion, and ſpeak evil of dignities. Jude 5—8. Here our times are exactly deſcribed by God, who ſaw them perfectly ſeventeen hundred years ago. Yet Wincheſter has followed others in denying that the words everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eternal, when applied to future miſery, mean without end. And he ſays, "The foundation of <hi>endleſs</hi> miſery, came from the Pagan theology." Though in the ſame book he ſays, "The great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Heathens, that die without ever being favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the light of the goſpel, and certainly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:030011_0154_0FE3BFD28EE504D0"/>ever hearing of <hi>endleſs</hi> miſery, convinces me, more than any logical arguments, that God has many ways of inſtructing and reclaiming his creatures, in <hi>another</hi> ſtate, that we are at preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with."<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 30, 151, Boſton edition, 1795, p. 68, 158.</note> And he has publiſhed this glar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contradiction now in Boſton, ſeven years after he firſt publiſhed it in London. So God ſays, Their folly ſhall be manifeſt unto all men. 2 Tim. iii. 9. Mr. Wincheſter returned to America, and landed at Boſton in July, 1794, and is ſpreading his opinions in this country, which makes it needful to hold up light againſt them.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. And the ſame may be ſaid concerning miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial tyranny. An inſtance of it was before given, in the ſelling of their miniſterial lands in Rehoboth, and obtaining an act to incorporate the committees who ſhould be annually choſen in each pariſh, to manage their funds of money, ſo that the intereſt thereof might ſupport their miniſters. The Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational name was not in the original grant of thoſe lands, though the produce of them is now claimed under that name. And ſince the foregoing account was written, a <hi>Narrative</hi> has been publiſhed, "By James Ellis, A. M. attorney at law." He is a ſon of the miniſter before named; and his narrative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms what I had before written, if it is carefully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined. He ſays, "The inhabitants of the precinct, at a lawful meeting, called for that purpoſe, unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly concurred with the church in the choice of Mr. Ellis." This was on November 10, 1784, p. 11. But he did not accept of that call, and wanted more money. Therefore at another meeting, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 27, 1784, they offered him an hundred pounds a year, and then he accepted their call; though this ſum was voted by but little more than twenty men, and near three hundred men were tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay it. Our author ſays, "Every perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:030011_0155_0FE3BF7DD1BF1F10"/>the precinct was taxed, and the collector ordered to gather the monies, without favour or partiality, or the leaſt diſcrimination." P. 63. Yet ſome of them belonged to Mr. Snow's church, ſome to Mr. Peck's , and many to Baptiſt churches; and a large majority never had any concern with Mr. Ellis as their miniſter. Yet his ſon ſays of the party who choſe his father, "Though they begun a good work, yet being deſtitute of the grace of perſeverance, they failed in its final completion, and brought difficulties to themſelves and all concerned." P. 16. But can any man believe, that it was a good work, for the minority to eſſay to force the majority to ſupport a miniſter whom they never choſe; or that grace was ever given to enable any to perſevere in ſuch a way? As theſe people found that they could not do it, and called back the bills from the collectors in the ſpring of 1790, Mr. Ellis ſued the whole precinct for his ſalary in the fall after, but the action was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to March. And as the leaders of the precinct were not willing always to lie under this yoke, they called a meeting, February 7, 1791, when it was voted, "That the precinct do not agree that the Rev. John Ellis ſhall officiate as miniſter in ſaid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct at the expenſe of ſaid precinct." And his ſon ſays, "Thus they flattered themſelves they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their miniſter, and boaſted much of their novel and ſhort method of diſmiſſion." P. 23. Though the whole community of the Maſſachuſetts had diſmiſſed their governor near four years before, and all America have ſtill the right to leave their higheſt rulers out of office at appointed times. But God ſays of myſtery Babylon, The woman which thou ſaweſt, is the great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth. Rev. xvii. 5, 18. And how evident is it, that the miniſters who are ſupported by law in our country belong to that great city? For the moſt of them were very active in procuring
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:030011_0156_0FE3BFD76E1B2D48"/>the revolt of America from the government of Great-Britain, while they have never allowed the people here the ſame liberty concerning their relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious teachers, as they have concerning their gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and legiſlators. And how can our legiſlature give miniſters a power that they never had them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Can men be any longer blinded about theſe affairs? If Mr. Ellis would have given up his claim upon that precinct for the future, his paſt ſalary would have been paid, and all the trouble of ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him out of their meeting-houſe, and the expenſe of courts upon theſe matters, would have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. But in October, 1794, their fund of money, as well as a ſalary for ſeven years, was given to Ellis's party by our ſupreme judicial court, with vaſt coſts of courts againſt his opponents. His ſon ſays, "A very full and candid hearing (continuing for two days and a half) was given both by judges and jurors. All records, from the firſt ſettling of the town of Rehoboth, were brought into view, the facts fully ſtated, and the law candidly conſidered." P. 49. And he ſays, "Reſpecting the fund, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the records, that in the year of our Lord, 1640, the old colony of Plymouth granted to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Rehoboth certain lands for the purpoſe of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting public teachers of the goſpel." P. 55. Very true; and for ſeventeen years after, all the arts of miniſters, and of other colonies, could not bring Plym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>outh legiſlature to interfere with the law of Chriſt, who ſays, They which preach the goſpel, ſhould live of the goſpel. 1 Cor. ix. 14. But in 1658, gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor Bradford, and other fathers of the colony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, their children yielded to the other colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, in introducing the uſe of the ſword to ſupport religious miniſters. And four Quakers were hanged directly after at Boſton, whoſe <hi>blood</hi> hath brought a laſting reproach upon New-England. Though it hath been ignorance or wickedneſs, in all men who
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:030011_0157_0FE3BE8CE97528C0"/>have not exempted Plymouth colony from that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. And how could lands which were given to ſupport preachers of the goſpel, be taken away to ſupport men who will not truſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his influence for their temporal living? For though Abraham was an eminent ſervant of God, yet his children were a generation of vipers when Chriſt came in the fleſh. Mat. iii. 7. And God ſays of ſuch, They hatch cockatrice eggs, and weave the ſpider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is cruſhed breaketh out into a viper. Iſaiah lix. 5. And how is this word now verified in this and other countries? For juſtice can often be had in civil cauſes, while it is denied in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious affairs. In the year 1760, they ſold 674 acres of miniſterial land in Rehoboth for more than four thouſand dollars; but half of that money, which belonged to the firſt pariſh, with ſeven hundred pounds more for Ellis's ſalary, with great coſts of court, have been taken from the majority of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and given to a ſmall party therein. And becauſe two men placed themſelves upon the ſtarrs of the pulpit, to prevent Mr. Ellis from crouding into it, on the day when the firſt Baptiſt miniſter preached therein, his ſon ſays, "They were adjudged guilty of a breach of the peace, and ſentenced to pay coſts of proſecution, amounting to ninety-five pounds, fifteen ſhillings and eleven pence; a high price for a ſeat upon the ſtairs in a decayed meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe." P. 32. Yes; and if a Baptiſt juſtice of the peace had not bound Mr. Ellis to his good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour until the next March, we have no reaſon to think that Baptiſt miniſters could peaceably have preached in ſaid houſe all that time. And his ſon now ſays of them, "This conduct has unwillingly obliged many, even of the charitable, to fear that they were not men of piety, or common honeſty."
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:030011_0158_0FE3BFDAE96D6C48"/>P. 68. Which gives a plain view of what many call piety and charity in our days.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. But the people who invited Baptiſt miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to preach there, ſoon obſerved that they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another kind of doctrine, as well as in another manner, than their former miniſters did; and a viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible change was wrought in many thereby, and the Baptiſts who uſed to go to other meetings, gathered to this. Alſo ſince Mr. Peck's death, his church is diſſolved, and many of his ſociety have come here. A number of ſouls were hopefully converted, and old believers were quickened, and they ſent for min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters to baptize them at ſundry times, until theſe, with ſome who were members of Baptiſt churches before, having called in advice, formed a Baptiſt church there, November 27, 1794. And Mr. John Peirce Jones, of Providence, having preached to them through the winter, was ordained their paſtor, March 18, 1795. They have ſince built themſelves a convenient meeting-houſe, in ſight of that which was taken from them, at the diſtance of more than a quarter of a mile. Their worſhip therein is to be governed by the church, and harmony appears among them. And the majority of the inhabitants of the towns of Rehoboth, Taunton, and ſome other towns, are now exempted from the taxing power of the Congregational denomination. And it is hoped that this freedom will prevail through the country, ſo that all men who are willing to obey the laws of Chriſt may no longer be oppreſſed by any who do not love him above all the things of time.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. The Baptiſt church of Taunton was firſt gathered in Norton. Mr. William Carpenter was ordained the paſtor of a ſeparate church there, Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 7, 1748. He was born in Rehoboth in 1710, and his labours in this church were ſucceſsful, until he and the majority of the church became Baptiſts, and he was inſtalled in that order, April 1, 1761.
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:030011_0159_0FE3BF80E96FF4B8"/>Some of the members of that church, eſpecially they who lived in Eaſton, had run into the moſt deluſive notions that could be conceived of; even ſo as to forſake their lawful wives and huſbands, and to take others; and they got ſo far as to declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be perfect and immortal, or that the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was paſt already, as ſome did in the apoſtolic age. 2 Tim. ii. 18.<note n="*" place="bottom">Shadrach Ireland, hereafter mentioned, was connected with them.</note> But elder Carpenter, and a majority of the church, rejected thoſe abominations, and he continued faithful unto his death, which happened Auguſt 23, 1768. The moſt of his church then lived in the eaſt part of Norton, towards Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, where a Baptiſt meeting had been long kept. Mr. Jeremiah Baſſet lived there who was a member of elder Round's church in Rehoboth, and obtained lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty from thence to hold worſhip on the Lord's-days at his houſe, as early as 1744; and he improved his gifts there, and their ſociety increaſed, until they built a good meeting-houſe, upon the great road from Taunton to Boſton, in 1767, and in April, 1769, the Baptiſt church of Norton united with the ſociety in Taunton, and have held their worſhip in that houſe ever ſince. Their ſecond paſtor was William Nelſon, A. M. who was born in Middleborough, July 18, 1741, baptized in June, 1761, educated in Rhode-Iſland college, and ordained the paſtor of this church, November 12, 1772. And a great harveſt of ſouls was granted among that people in 1780, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed their church to near eighty members. But as Mr. Nelſon was not of a ſtrong conſtitution, a ſudden cold, after preaching at a funeral, ſeized his lungs in ſuch a manner, that he was not able to preach for ſome years; and he removed down to the ſea in Dartmouth in 1786, where he hath recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered his ſtrength ſo far as to be able to preach occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally. His brother Ebenezer Nelſon was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a colleague with him, November 10, 1790.</p>

IX. A ſeparate church was formed in Attle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, and Mr. Nathaniel Shepard was ordained their paſtor, January 20, 1748; and he was well eſteemed until his death, April 4, 1752. Afterwards the Baptiſt principles gradually prevailed among them, until they conſtituted a Baptiſt church there in 1769, and Mr. Job Seamans was ordained their paſtor, December 15, 1773. He was born in Swanſea, May 13, 1748, and went to Nova-Scotia with elder Nathan Maſon in 1763, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and began to preach there. But upon a viſit to his native place, he went and preached in Attle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, which was ſo agreeable to this church, that they prevailed with him to remove and become their paſtor; and a great bleſſing was granted on his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in the winter before the American war; and a greater in the glorious year 1780, which increaſed his church to 81 members. Mr. Seamans was alſo very ſucceſsful in labouring in many other places. But his people grew very ſlack about his ſupport, and the inſurrection in 1786 produced unhappy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in his ſociety, ſo that he aſked a diſmiſſion from them, which the church granted in November, 1787, though with reluctance; and he removed the next ſummer and ſettled at New-London in New-Hampſhire, where (in its place) we ſhall have a good account of him. This church in At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleborough ſought for other helps, and Mr. Abner Lewis removed there in 1789, and miniſtered to them until 1794, when he removed back to Freetown, and though they have had other preachers ſince, yet they have no ſettled paſtor. Their meeting-houſe is upon the great road to Providence, 32 miles from Boſton. Six miles ſouth of them is the ſecond Baptiſt church in Attleborough. A ſeparate church was formed there, and Mr. Elihu Daggett was ordained their paſtor, July 3, 1765. He was born in that town, Auguſt 6, 1710; and he was beloved by his people,
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:030011_0161_0FE3BE903394CDB0"/>until he was taken away by death, Auguſt 29, 1769. He was baptized, and ſo were a number of his church, which increaſed to 43 members; but a past of them were only ſprinkled in infancy. Mr. Eli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Freetown, which is on the eaſt ſide of the river, againſt Dighton and Swanſea, was ſo abuſively treated by a Preſbyterian miniſter above ſeventy years ago, that a number of the people turned to the Quakers, and many others diſregarded any religious worſhip for a long time after. But it pleaſed God to pour out his Spirit upon the eaſt part of the town
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:030011_0162_0FE3BFE56AC82218"/>in 1773, when many were hopefully converted, and joined to the ſecond Baptiſt church in Middlebor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough. The next year they obtained preaching among themſelves, and they built them a houſe for worſhip, and formed a church there, September 13, 1775, being regularly diſmiſſed from the church they had joined to in Middleborough, and Mr. Abner Lewis was ordained their paſtor, June 26, 1776. He was born in Middleborough, March 16, 1745, joined to the firſt Baptiſt church there in 1765, began to preach in 1770, and had preached in Freetown two years before he was ordained; and ſuch a bleſſing was granted among them afterwards as increaſed their church to 128 members in 1780. But the public difficulties in the country, with the unhappy temper of ſome of the members of the church, cauſed Mr. Lewis to aſk a diſmiſſion from them, which he obtained in Auguſt, 1784; and he hath travelled and laboured in various places ſince, and hath ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the church in Harwich for more than a year paſt. The behaviour of ſome in this church hath cauſed a number to aſk and receive diſmiſſions from it to other churches, while ſome have died, and others removed away, until they are become very ſmall. The weſt part of Freetown enjoyed but little of the bleſſings which were granted round them, until the glorious year 1780, when a happy revival took place there, and a Baptiſt church was formed in 1781, and Mr. David Seamans was inſtalled their paſtor, Auguſt 13, 1783. He was a good preacher, and an exemplary walker, until he was drowned, by falling out of a canoe in the night, June 7, 1786, as he was returning from viſiting one of the fick of his flock. After this mournful providence, they obtained occaſional ſupplies, from time to time, until Mr. Philip Hathway was inſtalled their paſtor, June 13, 1792. He had been ordained in Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, September 30, 1790. They have built a
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:030011_0163_0FE3BE6B73AF6A30"/>good houſe for public worſhip ſince he was ſettled, and things appear to be encouraging among them.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. New-Bedford was once the eaſt part of Dartmouth, and a Baptiſt church was formed there, October 7, 1774; and Mr. Zaccheus Tobey preache<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The firſt miniſter in Dartmouth was a Baptiſt, but the Quakers have been a great majority in the town for many years, until they cenſured and excluded one of their chief miniſters in 1778, for appearing openly in favour of the Americans, while at war with Great-Britain. This cauſed a diviſion in their ſociety, and gave their children liberty to go to hear the preaching of other miniſters, which was denied them before, notwithſtanding their great name for liberty of conſcience. Baptiſt miniſters from Rehoboth and Swanſea frequently preached in Tiverton and Dartmouth, and ſuch a bleſſing was granted upon their labours in 1780, that many went and joined to thoſe churches, until a Baptiſt church was formed in Dartmouth, June 2, 1781, and Mr. Daniel Hicks was inſtalled their paſtor, the 10th of October following. He is a ſon of elder John Hicks, of Rehoboth, where he was born November 30, 1755, and was ordained there July 12, 1780. Another revival was granted in Dartmouth in 1784, which added thirty members to this church by the cloſe of the next year. In 1787 a great bleſſing was given upon the north part of New-Bedford, and a meeting was ſet up there, and many were baptized among them, who choſe to join as a branch of Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth church. Mr. Tucker Tabor was raiſed up to preach there, who, with a number of his brethren, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards removed into the State of New-York, though others have continued this meeting ever ſince, A revival of religion in Dartmouth in 1788, cauſed the addition of about forty members to the original church. A cold and trying time followed for ſeveral
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:030011_0164_0FE3BE95C97785E0"/>years, but a freſh revival began in January, 1794, which ſpread in Dartmouth, Freetown, New-Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford and Rocheſter; and Mr. John Lawrance was ordained a colleague with elder Hicks, the 23d of October following. He was born in Freetown, Auguſt 30, 1761, and he preaches chiefly in the eaſt part of that town. A Baptiſt meeting-houſe was built in the weſt part of Rocheſter in 1793, and ſuch a bleſſing was now granted there, that about forty perſons were baptized, who alſo joined as a branch of Dartmouth church; and their addition in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The Baptiſt church in Raynham ſprang from the great revival of religion which began in theſe parts in 1779, and it was formed in the year 1780, and increaſed to above fifty members the next year.

               <p n="14">XIV. The firſt Baptiſt church in the county of Bernſtable is in Harwich. The miniſters of that county generally oppoſed the great work which was in our land, in and after 1741; but Mr. Eliſha Paine, who was born in Eaſtham, went and preached there, and alſo at Harwich, in 1744, with great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. A ſeparation from the oppoſing miniſters was the conſequence; and Mr. Joſhua Nickerſon was ordained the paſtor of a ſeparate church there, Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary 23, 1749. Some of them were fined for ſeparating, and diſtreſs was made upon many for miniſterial taxes; but this ſerved to increaſe their number, until another church was formed in the weſt part of the town, and Mr. Richard Chaſe was ordained their paſtor, December 11, 1751. Theſe churches held to free communion with all Chriſtians, whether they were ſprinkled in infancy, or baptized
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:030011_0165_0FE3BF865B330B10"/>by immerſion; but as Mr. Chaſe was thus baptized in 1753, believers' baptiſm prevailed among them ſo much, that many gave up mixed communion, and a Baptiſt church was formed there, and Mr. Chaſe was inſtalled their paſtor, September 29, 1757. And their principles prevailed ſo much, that Mr. Nickerſon left his people, and went and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled at Tamworth, in New-Hampſhire. Mr. Chaſe miniſtered to his church for twenty years, and then the luſt of intemperance had prevailed ſo upon him, that he was depoſed from his office, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of a council, in January, 1777, and he remained out of fellowſhip until he died in January, 1794, above eighty years old. And though his fall into ſin was very ſhocking to many, yet the faithfulneſs of the Baptiſts in depoſing of him raiſed the credit of their profeſſion; and a freſh revival of religion among them cauſed their principles to prevail, ſo that the ſouth pariſh in Harwich received a Baptiſt miniſter to preach in their meeting-houſe, and a Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt church was gathered there, and a miniſter or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in 1781. But they were not in fellowſhip with the other church, and their miniſter proved himſelf to be a deceitful man, and finally went away and left them and their church was diſſolved. And in November, 1792, a minor part of the inhabitants of that pariſh ſettled a Congregational miniſter there, and about two years after they taxed all the Baptiſts to him, and in January, 1795, they appeared fierce for collecting of it, though advice from a diſtance reſtrained them therefrom. A happy revival of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was again granted among the Baptiſts in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich in the ſpring of 1793, which might occaſion this freſh attempt of their adverſaries to hold them in bondage as Pharaoh did. And in December, 1795, they ſet out in a cruel manner to collect ſaid tax, and hauled a number to gaol, and ſeized the eſtates of others without mercy.</p>

XV. A few people in Barnſtable withdrew from their pariſh worſhip, and ſet up a meeting by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in 1748; but they were ſined therefor, and two women were ſet in the ſtocks for not paying it. Yet their cauſe prevailed, and a church was formed there, and Mr. Nathanael Ewer was ordained their paſtor, May 10, 1750, and he continued with them for more than ten years, and then went and ſettled at Newmarket, in New-Hampſhire; and the Baptiſt principles gained ground in Barnſtable, until they formed a church there, June 20, 1771; and it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed gradually for ten years, in which time the moſt of them were exempted from taxes to Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational miniſters, as they had given in certificates to that party. But as a powerful work began among them in 1781, and a miniſter was raiſed up to preach among them, and he was ordained their paſtor, December 4, 1788, the ruling party reſolved to try what they could do towards holding them in bondage, as we have before related. Mr. Enoch Eldridge, who is their paſtor, was born in Harwich, and he hath preached a part of his time to the Baptiſt church in Harwich, ever ſince he began in the work of the miniſtry, until 1794. A freſh revival of religion was granted in thoſe two churches in the beginning of 1793, and Mr. Shubael Lovel, a young phyſician, was converted in Barnſtable in March, and he began to preach there in January, 1794, and he was ordained as an itinerant miniſter, April 29, 1795. Baptiſt meetings have been held for ſome years in Sandwich, Wellfleet, and Province<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in that county, though Baptiſt churches have not yet been formed among them.</p>

               <p n="1">I. BEFORE the revival of religion which took place in 1764, there was no Baptiſt church in any part of our country northward of Boſton, except one that is ſince diſſolved. The miniſters on both ſides of Merrimack river were combined together againſt the former reformation in our land; and though a few people in Haverhill were ſubjects of that work, and ſet up a meeting in ſeparation from thoſe miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, yet it did not continue long. But a miniſter of the weſt pariſh in Haverhill offended his people ſo much, as to cauſe controverſies in councils, and in publications to the world, which were followed with a forcible ſhutting of him out of their meeting-houſe, and then a diſmiſſion from his office there. And the people ſaw ſo much partiality in other miniſters towards him, that they would not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by them in calling another miniſter; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had been deſtitute for ſome years, before Mr. Hezekiah Smith came and preached there in 1764, and then gathered a church in the heart of the town in May, 1765, as is related in our ſecond volume, p. 236, 240—242. Their church increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an hundred and fifty members before the war; and when that broke out, Mr. Smith engaged very
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:030011_0169_0FE3BF8BB0B74870"/>heartily in the cauſe of his country, and was a chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain in our army through the moſt diſtreſſing part of the war, only he was at home with his people in the winters. A freſh revival of religion began among them in 1778, which cauſed the addition of 54 mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in three years; ſince which many have been diſmiſſed to other churches, and others have been added to this. Mr. Edmund Pilſbury, paſtor of the church in Northwood, was a member of this church. Aſa Meſſer, A.

               <p n="4">IV. The Baptiſt church in Newton ſprang part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from members who formerly joined to the ſecond Baptiſt church in Boſton, and partly from the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate churches of Brooklyne and Newton. A ſeparate church was formed in Brooklyne, and Mr. Jonathan Hide was ordained their paſtor, January 17, 1751; and he miniſtered to them until a Baptiſt church was formed in Newton, and then he met with them in his old age. A ſeparate church was alſo formed in Newton, and Mr. Nathan Ward was ordained their paſtor, January 17, 1753. But different ſentiments
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:030011_0171_0FE3BF904600A6D0"/>about the ſupport of the miniſtry, and about the improvement of gifts in the church, cauſed them to call a council, in April, 1758, after which Mr. Ward was diſmiſſed, and he has been a miniſter in the town of Plymouth, in New-Hampſhire, for thirty years paſt. Some of the old brethren died, and others removed into diſtant parts of our country, and things were in a broken poſture in Newton for many years.

But a freſh revival was granted at Newton, and Mr. Joſeph Grafton was called to preach there, and he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained their paſtor, June 18, 1788.

Yet there were a few names in Cambridge who had not defiled their garments; and in the glorious year 1780 a number more were converted, and a new Baptiſt church was

And not long after their laſt caſes in court were decided in favour of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, their miniſter left them, in April, 1793, and removed to Danvers, as was before mentioned. Yet ſuch a revival was granted among them ſoon after, eſpecially in Woburn, as cauſed the addition of 37 members to this church in two years, and a new meeting-houſe was built in Woburn. Mr. John Peak laboured among them more than a year, and Mr. Lovel ſucceeded him laſt fall. And in 1795 the firſt pariſh in Cambridge procured an act of our legiſlature, to empower them to ſell ſome miniſterial lands in the town, and to ſecure all the monies ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thereby, for the ſupport of Congregational miniſters in that pariſh. A Baptiſt church was formed in Weſton, July 14, 1789, in which were 19 members the next year; but they have not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſince. A Baptiſt meeting hath been upheld for many years in Framingham, where no church is yet formed.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The Baptiſt church at Leiceſter, in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Worceſter, was conſtituted September 28, 1738,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:030011_0173_0FE3BF95864CCB00"/>under the charge of elder Thomas Green, who was ordained a year before, a colleague with elder March, of Sutton; but they now became two churches by mutual conſent. Elder Green went from Malden, and was an early planter at Leiceſter, and became a very uſeful phyſician, and acquired ſuch an eſtate, that he was the main ſupport of his ſociety in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals as well as ſpirituals all his days. He travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led much in the country as a phyſician, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed frequently, and baptized many, until he was caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away by death, Auguſt 20, 1773, aged 73. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin Foſter, D. D. who was educated at Yale col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, was ordained his ſucceſſor, October 23, 1776, and the church increaſed under his miniſtry, from 30 to 76 members, in five years. But as he in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to devote himſelf entirely to ſtudy, and to the miniſtry of the word, the people who had not him uſed to ſupport their miniſter, neglected him to much, that he requeſted a diſmiſſion from the church, which they at length granted, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly, in 1782, and he went and preached Danvers, his native place, above two years. And in January, 1785, he was called to the firſt church in Newport, where he laboured with ſucceſs for man than two years, and then went to New-York, and is now the paſtor of the firſt Baptiſt church in that city. Mr. Iſaac Beals was the next paſtor of the Baptiſt church in Leiceſter, where he was ordained, December 1, 1784, and they proſpered under his miniſtry for two years; but then an inſurrection took place in that part of the country, which great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly effected that church and ſociety; and after many endeavours to ſettle matters among them, without ſo good an effect as to unite them all again, he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed in 1789, and went and ſettled at Clarendon, in Vermont, where he is now a uſeful miniſter. Mr. Nathan Dana, from Newton, was ſoon after called to preach at Leiceſter; and he was ordained at
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:030011_0174_0FE3BE7377EE8AE0"/>Newton as an itinerant miniſter, November 20, 1793, and now miniſters to this people.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. A ſeparate church was formed at Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, and Mr. John Blunt was ordained their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, September 28, 1748; and they became nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, before the Baptiſt principles were embraced among them in June, 1749, and before the end of that year above ſixty members, including all the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the church, were baptized. Some account of their ſufferings was given in our ſecond volume, p. 191—194. But ſome ſeparate miniſters in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut made ſuch terrible repreſentations of its being a wicked thing for any to be re-baptized, that Mr. Blunt retracted his being dipped, and he left his people, and went into our army, where he was ſlain near lake George, September 8, 1755. And though the main body of the church perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their profeſſion, yet they paſſed through many trying ſcenes, and did not obtain a ſettled miniſter for many years. Mr. William Ewing preached there for ſome time, and was ordained there, Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 27, 1768, as an itinerant miniſter; and he went from thence to South-Brimfield, and ſince to other places, as was before obſerved. Mr. Jordan Dodge, from Canterbury, was called to preach at Sturbridge, and he was ordained their paſtor, Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 27, 1784, and they proſpered under his miniſtry for ſeveral years; but in the cloſe of 1788, ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties aroſe that he aſked and obtained a diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and went and ſettled in the State of New-York, where he was found to be a deceitful man, and was rejected by the Baptiſt churches in thoſe parts. However, the ſchool of afflictions which this church hath been in, with the ſpiritual teachings that have been granted to them, hath brought them to conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable fruitfulneſs in Chriſtian knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, in which it is hoped they will grow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe unto the end. A freſh revival was lately
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:030011_0175_0FE3BF9AA1717A48"/>granted among them under the preaching of brother Zenas L. Leonard, who is likely to become their paſtor.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. The Baptiſt church in Charlton was firſt formed in Spencer in 1762, and Mr. Nathanael Green was ordained their paſtor October 12, 1763. Their meeting was afterwards held in the weſt part of Leiceſter, until it was removed into Charlton in 1773, where it continues. And though it was a low time with them for ſeveral years, yet a glorious work began among them in 1779, which cauſed the addition of 109 members in three years. The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of divine grace in this land at that time when the war raged on every hand, and had greatly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the morals of the people, and public credit was fallen to the ground, was evidently a great cauſe of ſaving America from deſtruction. This work was then powerful in Virginia, as well as in other part of our land. Elder Green continued a faithful paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and an exemplary walker, until he fell aſleep in Jeſus, March 21, 1791, in the ſeventieth year of his age. And the church ſoon after called Mr. David Rathbun to preach to them, and he was ordained their paſtor, September 25, 1793. He was born in Stonington, May 29, 1763, and his father, uncle, and one of his brothers, are all now paſtors of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt churches.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. A Baptiſt church was conſtituted in Sutton, September 16, 1735, and Mr. Benjamin Marſh was ordained their paſtor, September 28, 1737, colleague with Mr. Green. Mr. Marſh was eſteemed as a godly man, of an exemplary life, though not of large gifts, until his death, January 4, 1775, aged 90. But the church was then ſmall, and it is ſince diſſolved. There had been a great revival of religion in the Congregational ſociety in Sutton, in the year 1741, and a ſeparate church was formed among them, and Mr. Ezekiel Cole was ordained their paſtor, January
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:030011_0176_0FE3BFFAF975D6C0"/>31, 1751. But they were broken and ſcattered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and a Baptiſt church was gathered there; April 27, 1765, and Mr. Jeremiah Barſtow was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled their paſtor, May 26, 1768. But a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſentiment about the doctrines of grace cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his diſmiſſion from them, by the advice of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, October 1, 1772; and he removed to Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in Connecticut, and never took the charge of any other church, though he preached occaſionally, until he died ſuddenly, by a fall from his horſe, June 4, 1795. Mr. Eliſha Ranſom preached to this church for ſome years, and was ordained there as an itinerant, November 11, 1778; but he went the next year to Woodſtock, in Vermont. This church in Sutton remained without a paſtor, until ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision aroſe therein that they were left out of the Warren Aſſociation in 1786. But the majority of them obtained a comfortable ſettlement again, and Mr. Ebenezer Lamſon removed there from Aſhford, and was their miniſter from 1788, until April, 1794, when they diſcovered that he had fallen into the opinion of univerſal ſalvation, and rejected him. The other part of this church embraced the opinion of mixed communion, and at length joined to the Croton Conference; but both churches were favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a happy revival of religion in 1792, and are now in comfortable circumſtances. Two of the breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of the firſt church in Sutton, Samuel Waters and Samuel King, have been called to improve their gifts in preaching the goſpel, though they are not ordained. Mr. William Batcheller, a member of the church in Northbridge, who lives in the eaſt part of Sutton, hath preached in thoſe parts for ſeveral years, until a freſh revival was granted there, a church was formed, and he was ordained their paſtor, Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 10, 1792. The Baptiſt church in Northbridge was conſtituted, Auguſt 31, 1780, and Mr. John
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:030011_0177_0FE3BF9EDD5137F0"/>Cooper was ordained therein, October 11, 1794, when there was a happy time among them.</p>
               <p n="10">X. A Baptiſt church was formed in Peterſham, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 1768, and Mr. Samuel Dennis preached to them for a number of years, before he was ordained their paſtor in October, 1778. He was ſo well eſteemed in the town, that he was choſen a member of our legiſlature in the time of the war: but worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs did not turn him aſide from faithfulneſs in the church, until he reſted from his labours in April 1783. His church perſevered in their profeſſion, though their meeting is removed into the bounds of Hardwick, where it is ſtill continued.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Royalſtone lies upon the north borders of our State, adjoining to Richmond, in New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. Mr. Whitman Jacobs had been paſtor of the Baptiſt church at Thompſon, in Connecticut, more than twenty years, before a part of them removed and ſettled in Royalſtone, formed a church there and he was inſtalled their paſtor, December 13, 1770. Their number was 29 the next year; and they had a revival in 1774, and another in 1779, and their church increaſed to 89. But ſuch contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies aroſe in their church about diſcipline, and about ſome political affairs, that their miniſter was diſmiſſed in 1786, and he is now at Guilford, in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont. In 1789 Mr. Moſes Kenny was ſettled as the paſtor of Royalſtone, and they had a large increaſe of members for ſeveral years after.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Harvard is a place where the goodneſs of God and the folly of man have been remarkably diſcovered. A powerful work of grace was wrought in that town, in the time of the great revival of religion through this land; but amazing delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions appeared there afterwards. For Shadrach Ireland, of Charleſtown, near Boſton, after acting as a teacher for ſome years, profeſſed to have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced ſuch a change, both in body and mind, that
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:030011_0178_0FE3BFFF8D15B758"/>he was become perfect and immortal, and a number more with him, in the ſpring of 1753. And he ſet himſelf up as the head of the church, and aſſumed God's prerogatives in ſuch a blaſphemous manner, that he was in danger of being puniſhed by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; upon which he abſconded, and his followers ſaid he was gone out of this wicked country. But he was concealed in Harvard, where a large houſe was built for him, in part of which another family lived, and ſcarcely any men knew that he was there but his followers, who reſorted to him for his bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from various and diſtant parts of the country, and brought him a plenty of proviſions. Ireland forbid them to marry, or to lodge with each other, if they were married, and he had left a wife and children in Charleſtown; yet he took an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other woman, and lodged with her in Harvard all his remaining days. And when he was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſeized with death, he ſaid, "I am going, but don't bury me; for the time is ſhort: God is coming to take the church." Therefore he was put into a large <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or, filled up with lime, and laid in the cellar, where it continued from September, 1778, to July, 1779, when the body ſcented ſo much that it was carried out in the night and buried in a corn-field. This account I have from under the hand of one of his followers, who has ſince been delivered from that deluſion. But in the ſpring of 1780, another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany appeared above Albany, with a woman at their head, with great ſigns and lying wonders, and ſuch uncommon motions of their bodies, that they were called <hi>Shakers.</hi> They removed from place to place, until they fixed their head-quarters at the houſe where Ireland died, in Auguſt, 1781; and they carried on at ſo high a rate there, that a motion was made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n our legiſlature to have them puniſhed by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which motion was negatived by the majority of a ſingle vote, as we were well informed. But the fear
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:030011_0179_0FE3BFA44D752508"/>of a mob cauſed the removal of their leaders from Harvard in 1782, and they came to Norton, and then to Rehoboth in the fall of that year. And they prevailed with many of their ſociety to ſell their eſtates, in order to build a ſhip to carry the church to the New-Jeruſalem, as they ſaid. And a large veſſel was built in Rehoboth; but it was ſent a voyage to the Weſt-Indies, from whence a rich <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p n="13">XIII. But a more happy ſcene now opens upon Harvard. A young phyſician was converted there June 18, 1775, the day after the bloody batt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> to preach the goſpel the next winter. He was born at Weſtford, November 13, 1752, and ſtudied phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic with Dr. Green, of Leiceſter, and then ſettled in Harvard. And having called elder Rich from Chel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Iſaiah Parker, Stephen Gates, Tarbel Willard, William Willard, Joſeph Stone, Joſiah Willard and eight women were baptized, and they were formed into a church, June 27, 1776, and Dr. Parker was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained their paſtor, June 10, 1778. But two years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were remarkably oppreſſed, in a time when it might have been leaſt expected. For the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Maſſachuſetts government was publiſhed March 2, 1780, when the compilers of it ſaid to the people, "Your delegates did not conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be veſted with power to ſet up one denom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination of Chriſtians above another; for religion muſt at all times be a matter between God and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals." This they ſaid becauſe Proteſtants were not ſet above Papiſts in our legiſlature; but in each town, one denomination has been ſet up above all the reſt
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:030011_0180_0FE3BB0A557AF660"/>to this day, which they then acknowledged they had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o right to do. And one member of the Baptiſt church in Harvard was impriſoned at Worceſter three months, another five, and one of their ſociety ſix months, between the publication of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and its taking place in October, for taxes to a Congregational miniſter, who was ſettled in the name of the king of Great-Britain. Theſe three men kept exact accounts of all their expenſes while in priſon, with all that was given them there; and their accounts were examined the next year by two judicious men, who have given it from under their hands, that they expended an hundred and three dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and a third, more than all that they received there. And no recompenſe hath ever been made therefor by their oppreſſors. And can any man who believes that God governs the world, think it ſtrange that the powers of Britain have been ſuffered to rob the Americans of their property, when robberies for religious miniſters under Britiſh commiſſions have been openly approved of in our country? May we not ſay with Jacob, O my ſoul, come not thou into their ſecret; unto their aſſembly, mine honour, be not thou united! This church in Harvard was ſoon after attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſpirit of deluſion, ſo that they ſaid in a letter to the Warren Aſſociation, September 8, 1783, "For twelve months we had but two perſons added, and ſeveral left us, and joined the Shakers. We excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated eight perſons in that time. A form of godlineſs appeared on one hand, and a falſe power on the other, and the church in ſuch a low ſtate, that we feared at times that our candleſtick would be removed out of its place. We ſaw the enemy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in like a flood, and that except the Spirit of the Lord ſhould lift up a ſtandard againſt him, we were a ruined people. Therefore we appointed a day of faſting and prayer, that God would pour out his Spirit among us, and work wonders under the name of
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:030011_0181_0FE3BFAAA3889E60"/>his holy child Jeſus; and we have reaſon to think that the Lord gave us a ſpirit of grace and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and, for his own name ſake, was pleaſed to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer us in mercy. The faſt was on September 4, 1782, when there was a remarkable diſplay of God's power and grace, in convincing ſinners of their loſt ſtate, the hardneſs of their hearts and blindneſs of their minds, with their pride of life and rejecting the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt; and then giving them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſin of the world; the free ſalvation of the goſpel, and cauſing them to rejoice therein; ſo that 49 perſons were baptized among us from September 22 to No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 24, and 58 perſons have been baptized among us ſince the work began; and we have often ſat under Chriſt's ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to our taſte. Our preſent number is 110." And they have enjoyed many bleſſings ſince.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. The Baptiſt church in Aſhburnham was conſtituted in February, 1779, and they have gone through ſcenes of proſperity and adverſity; have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured oppreſſion from others, and many trying things among themſelves. In 1787 ſuch a revival was granted among them, as increaſed their church in one year from 37 to 61 members. But they have never had an ordained paſtor, nor any great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſince. Several gifted brethren among them aſſiſt in carrying on their worſhip, and they get help at times from other churches.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. The Baptiſt church in Templeton was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Auguſt 21, 1782, and Mr. John Sollon was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained their paſtor, November 19, 1783. He was born in England in 1727, and lived a while at Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton after he came to America. He miniſtered to this church about two years, and then was diſmiſſed; and he hath preached ſince in various places, and is now living in Peterſham. This church hath had
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:030011_0182_0FE3C009ED556478"/>many miniſters to labour with them, and a happy revival of religion hath been granted there in two years paſt, though they have not obtained another ſettled paſtor. The Baptiſts are ſo much eſteemed in that town, that two members of their church have lately been repreſentatives in our legiſlature.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. A Baptiſt church was formed in Grafton in 1767, and they proſpered for ſome years, and had 39 members in 1780. Above three years after, Mr. Elkanah Ingalls, of Rehoboth, went and lived there, and was their miniſter for about four years; and then it was diſcovered that he, with the majority of the church, had fallen into the opinion of univerſal ſalvation, and they were left out of the Warren Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation in 1788, and he removed back to Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, and is become a common drunkard. But a minor part of the church continued in their former faith, and ſet up their meeting in Upton, and Mr. Simeon Snow was ordained in their community in June, 1791. They hold worſhip ſteadily there, though, their number being ſmall, they have joined as a branch to Bellingham church. A Baptiſt church was once formed in Douglaſs, and Adam streeter was ordained their paſtor, November 24, 1774; but he fell into the opinion of univerſal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and was depoſed from his office in 1781, and the church is ſince diſſolved, though a Baptiſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is often held there ſtill. Streeter preached up his new opinions in various parts of the country for ſeveral years, and is ſince dead. A Baptiſt church was formed in Dudley in 1775, and elder Obed Warren was raiſed up among them, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards removed into the State of New-York; but as many removed away, their church is ſmall, if it is not diſſolved. Baptiſt meetings have been held in Brookfield, Shrewſbury, and Holden, where churches are not yet formed.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THE firſt Baptiſt church in the county of Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire was formed in Brimfield, November 4, 1736, and Mr. Ebenezer Moulton was ordained their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, November 4, 1741. His father and a majority of the church oppoſed the work that was then going on in the land, while he and a minor part were alive in it; and they had much controverſy about it for ſeven years, and then about fifteen of them told their experiences to each others' ſatisfaction, and ſigned new articles and a covenant; and Mr. Moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton took them as his church, and would not allow any others to commune with them, without coming in at this door. The majority complained of this as unreaſonable, but acted nothing as a body againſt them. And many from other towns joined with them, in this new form, from time to time; and elder Moulton was often called to other places to preach and baptize in and after the year 1749. Yes, he was called above eighty miles that year, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized ten at Bridgwater, and three in Raynham. But as his people had been trained up with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices againſt hireling miniſters, they did very little for the ſupport of their own miniſter; therefore be took to merchandizing, when there were ſcarcely any merchants in that part of the country; and he ſeemed to proſper for a number of years, and
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:030011_0184_0FE3BE9EB9F17730"/>was a leader in building them a new meeting-houſe. But towards the cloſe of the war, which ended in 1763, money was plenty, and merchants were multiplied; and Mr. Moulton found himſelf involved in debt, and his creditors ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour him, and he fled to Nova-Scotia, where he preached in ſeveral places. Hereupon the church looked out for another miniſter, and at length ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Mr. James Mellen, who was ordained their paſtor, September 11, 1765. He was of Framing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, but had joined to the firſt Baptiſt church in Middleborough; and he was a faithful and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful paſtor, until he finiſhed his courſe in a joyful manner, Auguſt 5, 1769. After his death many of the old members, who had been excluded from the church for twenty years, came up and claimed a right therein; upon which they ſent to other elders and churches for advice, and when they had heard the caſe, their advice was for each of them to endeavour to ſatisfy the others about the reality of their religion, and ſo to covenant together anew. And this advice was taken and followed with good effects. After this they called Mr. Elijah Codding, another member of the firſt Baptiſt church in Middleborough, and he was ordained their paſtor, November 11, 1773. And though it was a low time with them at South-Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field for ſome years, yet ſuch a heavenly ſhower was granted in 1779, as increaſed their members from 23 to 236 in four years, and their miniſter ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains with them. And in thoſe times Mr. Moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton obtained letters of licenſe from his creditors to come home, and he was eſteemed among his old people, until he died there in 1783.</p>
               <p n="2">II. A Baptiſt church was formed in Weſt-Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, and Edward Upham, A. M. was ordained their paſtor, October 15, 1740. He was born at Malden, March 26, 1709, and educated in the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege at Cambridge, where he took his firſt degree in
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:030011_0185_0FE3BFB41F144898"/>1734. After the death of Mr. John Callender, he was prevailed with to remove to Newport, in 1749, and he miniſtered to the firſt church there, only viſiting his old people once or twice a year, until he removed back to them in April, 1771. Though in the mean time ſome of the wealthieſt Baptiſts had been drawn into the incorporation of a new pariſh there, and to ſettle a miniſter, who was to ſprinkle or dip people as they choſe, and all were to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune together. And when Mr. Upham came back, and ſet up worſhip at his uſual place, taxes to the government were laid upon him, and he could not obtain the liberty that all ſettled miniſters have, without ſueing for it in two or three courts. And many broils, and great bitterneſs of ſpirit hath been among them ever ſince. Mr. Upham has been ſo infirm that he has not been able to preach for ſome years paſt, and the people are in very broken cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The town of Aſhfield was planted in 1751, and a Baptiſt church was formed there, July 10, 1761, and Mr. Ebenezer Smith was ordained their paſtor the 20th of Auguſt following. An account of their ſufferings was given in our ſecond volume, p. 247—253. In 1770 they had 32 members, and they increaſed from time to time, until the glorious bleſſings of the year 1780 raiſed their number to 94. But the uncommon difficulties about money after the war, cauſed a contention between the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter and the majority of the church about his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, which produced an open diviſion in 1785. They called a council in December, 1786, who juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the miniſter, and condemned the majority of the church, and in September, 1788, he prevailed with the Warren Aſſociation to leave them out of their number. But a powerful work began among them at that time, and they increaſed to 113 mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in leſs than two years, having ordained his
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:030011_0186_0FE3C00F703FD650"/>brother as their paſtor. But as there have been ſome very unhappy actions in both parties, they have need of conſidering the warning which was given to the churches of Galatia, which is, If ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not conſumed one of another. Gal. v. 15.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. A Baptiſt church was formed at Montague, July 1, 1765. An account of their ſufferings is in our ſecond volume, p. 261—263. Mr. Simeon Coombs, from the third Baptiſt church in Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, removed there, and was ordained in that church, November 10, 1791. The majority of their ſociety then lived in Leverett, and they now bear that name. Mr. Coombs miniſtered to them about three years, and then was diſmiſſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to Wardſborough in Vermont.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The firſt Baptiſt church in Wilbraham was conſtituted in 1768, and Mr. Seth Clark was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained their paſtor, June 13, 1770. He was born in Northampton in April, 1723, and experienced a change of heart, in the glorious work there in 1735, under the miniſtry of Preſident Edwards. This church had 39 members in 1773, after which our national controverſies and a bloody war engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the minds of men in general, until it pleaſed God to pour out his Spirit in ſuch a manner in 1778 as increaſed this church to 161 members in four years, beſide thoſe who had died, been diſmiſſed or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. After peace was reſtored to our land, the minds of people were amazingly carried away with earthly vanities, and the love of many waxed cold about religion. Yet this church enjoyed many bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and they wrote to our Aſſociation in 1792, and ſaid, "Through the goodneſs of God, we are viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the down-pouring of his Spirit in a moſt marvellous manner, not only in almoſt all parts of this town, and in each denomination, but alſo in the and joining towns. Our preſent number is 235."
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:030011_0187_0FE3BFB908649EE0"/>They wrote again 1794, that they had diſmiſſed 34, who were formed into a ſecond Baptiſt church in Wilbraham, while 228 members remained in the firſt church. Theſe bleſſings will appear the more wonderful, if we conſider that the inſurrection in 1787 was in theſe parts.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The Baptiſt church in New-Salem was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in January, and Mr. Samuel Bigelow was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained their paſtor, May 21, 1772. He was born at Watertown in 1738, and new born in 1763. A gradual increaſe was granted to this church, until they had 38 members in 1785. But controverſies about diſcipline in the church were followed with a bloody conteſt in the State, which made rending work among this people. The army who marched up againſt the inſurgents in the winter of 1787, took their courſe through Wilbraham to Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, where a few were ſlain, from whence they went to Hadley, and then turned through New-Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem to Peterſham. Mr. Bigelow wrote to a friend on Auguſt 31, 1787, and ſaid, "Church travel and ordinances have ceaſed here, ever ſince the people aroſe in arms againſt government; though at preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent we are better united as to public worſhip. There is in general a good agreement between me and the body of the people about worſhip. I have ſaid but little about the family quarrel that has been in this Commonwealth the year paſt; but what I have ſaid has been to condemn both ſides. I think the political fathers have provoked their children to wrath, and by oppreſſion wiſe men have been mad, and the children have been unruly and rebellious." And it was a low time among them for three years. But he wrote to the ſame friend, February 12, 1790, and ſaid, "This part of Zion has ſcarce ever been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a few drops of the rain of righteouſneſs; but about ſix weeks ago, the Lord began to rain ſuch a ſhower as has not fallen in theſe parts before. It is chiefly
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:030011_0188_0FE3BEA446EECF90"/>on the youth, from ten to twenty years old. The people in general are bowed before it. A goodly number are hopefully gathered in, and ſome from almoſt every family. There is alſo ſome ſhaking among the dry bones in Shuteſbury." Mr. Bigelow had been diſmiſſed from his paſtoral rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this church before, by the advice of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and he preached in various places afterwards, until he gathered a church in Belcherton, and is at preſent their miniſter. They obtained ſeveral min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters to preach in New-Salem, until Mr. Joſiah Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutt was ordained their paſtor, October 30, 1794, and continues with them.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. When the late war began, the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional miniſter of Shuteſbury openly appeared to favour the Britiſh claims over America; therefore the people ſhut him out of their meeting-houſe, and he afterwards removed from the town. Yet after the war he ſued the town for his ſalary, and our courts compelled the town to pay it, which cauſed miniſterial tyranny to appear ſo odious, that no min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter of that order hath been received in the town ſince. Mr. William Ewing was called to preach there for ſeveral years, and in 1779 he was elected a delegate to the convention who formed the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts conſtitution of government, and he earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed the continuance of the Congregational eſtabliſhment therein, as other Baptiſt members alſo did, though the majority prevailed againſt them. A happy revival of religion was granted in Shuteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury in 1780, when a Baptiſt church was formed there, and Ewing miniſtered to the town until 1785, when he went to Rowley. Mr. Joſeph Smellage was called from South-Brimfield to preach at Shuteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury directly after, and he was ordained the paſtor of this church in October, 1786, and they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed many bleſſings ſince, and he is continued with them to this time.</p>

VIII. The Aſſociation minutes give the number of members in the churches of Leyden, Cheſterfield and Colerain; but a more full account of them, which I had an encouragement of, is not arrived. Mr. Adam Hamilton, who came from Britain, had lived ſome years in Weſtfield, before a revival of religion was granted there, and a Baptiſt church was formed in 1784, and he was ordained their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in November, 1785. He was much eſteemed as a preacher of the goſpel, and laboured much at home and abroad; and when the Danbury Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was formed, he had a chief lead therein for two or three years. But he then removed to New-York, and was miniſter to a church there in 1793; after which he came back to Weſtfield, but fell into ſome ſcandals, which cauſed him to ceaſe from preaching. Another Baptiſt church was formed in part of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field in 1785, which part is ſince incorporated by the name of Ruſſell, and Mr. Ebenezer Stow is their paſtor. The other churches in the county of Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, with the date of their conſtitution and then preſent ſtate are given in the foregoing liſt, from printed minutes, and the beſt information I could gain. I am favoured with a more particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome of the following churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>County of Berkſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">IX. The lands near the head of Houſack river, which runs into the Hudſon at Still water, were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by ſome men in Providence and Coventry in 1766, and a number of men removed there the next year. They firſt called the place New-Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but the place was afterward a part of the town of Adams, having Laneſborough on the ſouth of it, until part of ſeveral towns were incorporated by the name of Cheſhire in 1793. The firſt inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants ſoon ſet up public worſhip among them, and being joined by others from various parts of the
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:030011_0190_0FE3BE78B967A9D8"/>country, they formed a Baptiſt church there, Auguſt 29, 1769. Elder Peter Werden paid them a viſit in the fall after; and as many of them had been his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before, he at their earneſt requeſt removed there in March, 1770. He was born June 6, 1728, and ordained at Warwick, May 21, 1751, and, after many labours in thoſe parts, now removed to this place, and hath been much of a leader among the churches who form the Shaftſbury Aſſociation. An uncommon death in the beginning of 1772, with a ſermon at the funeral, was the means of beginning a revival of religion among this people; and in the fall after, the work came on more powerfully, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed through the winter. As the church gave a written account of this work, the moſt material part of it is here inſerted. They ſay, </p>
               <q>

                           <p>"The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God began to be more manifeſtly quickened, and more earneſtly engaged than they before had been. Love and unity daily increaſed, and concern of mind began to be powerful on the minds of the unregenerate; and not long after ſome began to give hopeful evidences that they had paſſed from death unto life. The firſt of our young converts that made a public declaration of what God had done for them, were received into the church and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized on November 15, 1773. Soon after this, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of ſoul, and awakenings on the conſciences of ſinners, became more general, ſo that it was manifeſt by their uncommon attention and ſolemnity in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic meetings, and their earneſt inquiries and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble complaints in their private converſation, that the Spirit of God was operating on many of them; and in the courſe of the enſuing winter and ſpring, we had reaſon to hope that near forty were ſavingly brought home to God, by a living union to Jeſus Chriſt. Our number of members has increaſed to about eighty. And although upon the moſt cloſe inquiry, there appears to be a great variety of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:030011_0191_0FE3BEA8DA81FAF0"/>in the ſubjects of the late work, yet in ſeveral things there appeared a general agreement. A clear conviction of ſin, of the univerſal depravity of human nature, the reaſonable requirements of God's holy law, his juſt declaration of vengeanes againſt ſin, and the total ſhutting up of all the ſources of their natural hope, which is ever ſeeking ſome legal qualification to prepare for God's mercy; and then a diſcovery of the all-ſufficient righteouſneſs of the Son of God, as mediator between God and man, a ſenſible union to God, love to holineſs, hatred of ſin, union to the children of God, and pity and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence to all mankind; in theſe and in other things of like nature, there appeared a very general agreement. The means of awakening people among us have been various, as, the preaching of the word, prayer, exhortation, religious converſation, occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of divine providence, and the like; but the public relations of experiences, of thoſe who have been wrought upon, have been as frequent a means as any. The moſt of the ſubjects of this work were in the vigour of youth, from fifteen to twenty-five years; though we have reaſon to think that ſome who were advanced in age, and ſome little children, have been made the happy partakers of the ſalvation of God. This church does not receive any as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but ſuch as give ſatisfying evidences that they are born of God, neither have they table-communion with any but thoſe who profeſs and practiſe believers baptiſm. They make no bar of communion, wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er perſons come under hands or not. They hold to a general right in the brethren to improve their gifts, and yet believe that the church ought to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe government therein, ſo that the church may be edified by the gifts of the brotherhood. We believe the entire depravity of human nature, and that the juſtification of a ſinner before God is alone in the
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:030011_0192_0FE3C0140439F860"/>righteouſneſs of Chriſt. This was publickly read and acknowledged by the church as a true relation.</p>

               <p>Another powerful work began among this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in 1779, which increaſed the church to 133 members in 1782. A great bleſſing was again granted in 1788, which cauſed the addition of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty members to this church in a year. A like fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour was given again in 1791, ſo that the next year they had 194 members. But many have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed to other churches, while ſome have died, and ſome have been excluded, ſo that their preſent num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is not ſo large.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Elder Nathan Maſon and his people, who went to Nova-Scotia in 1763, enjoyed many ſpiritual bleſſings there, and Mr. Job Seamans was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and began to preach among them; but not finding the lands in that country, nor the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of it, to anſwer their expectations, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved back, and ſettled in Laneſborough, a few miles from elder Werden, where a church was eſtabliſhed in 1771; and the work which came on in 1779 was powerful in both churches, and cauſed ſuch a friendſhip between them as gradually remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſeparation that had been handed down from their fathers, about laying on of hands upon every member. His church increaſed to 150 members in 1784, and enjoyed many bleſſings afterwards. But when elder Maſon joined with elder Leland in 1791, a few of the church parted from him, and retain their old conſtitution, as was before mentioned. Elder John Leland was born in the county of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, and was baptized and began to preach there in 1774. In the fall of 1776, he ſet off with his
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:030011_0193_0FE3BFC34F5625C0"/>wife, whom he had newly married, and removed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Virginia, and ſettled in the county of Orange; and he travelled and preached abundantly in thoſe parts, and in fourteen years he baptized 607 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and chiefly in the years 1780 and 1788, in which years religion was greatly revived in Virginia. He was very helpful in obtaining the law, in 1786, which aboliſhed all tax and compulſion in Virginia for the ſupport of any religious miniſters. He pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a pamphlet called the Virginia Chronicle, in which was the addreſs of the Baptiſts to Preſident Waſhington, and his anſwer, which we have referred to under 1789. He has alſo publiſhed ſeveral other things; and he returned with his family to New-England in 1791, and ſettled in Cheſhire, in that part which once was Laneſborough, and elder Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is in the church with him, which is now large.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Mr Valentine Rathbun was born at Stoning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in December, 1723, and after he, with many of his friends, removed to Pittsfield, they formed a Baptiſt church there in 1772, and he was ordained their paſtor, and they became a large church in 1780. But many of them had now become corrupt in their opinions, and imagined that great and new things were at hand, with a more glorious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation than had before been known. And in April that year a man came into the place, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them, that a company of Chriſtians appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above Albany, who had greater light and power than any had enjoyed before in latter ages; and many went up and joined to them, among whom were Mr. Rathbun of Pittsfield, and Mr. Samuel Johnſon, a Preſbyterian miniſter in New-Lebanon, weſt of Pittsfield, in the State of New-York; and moſt of the inhabitants of that town received them, as well as a large part of elder Rathbun's church. Though in about three months he left them, and publiſhed a diſcourſe againſt their abominations,
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:030011_0194_0FE3C01E88F215B8"/>dated December 5, 1780, which was ſo well receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it paſſed five editions in a year, and was read much in all parts of the country. His brother Daniel Rathbun continued with them about four years, and then he came out from them, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a more full account of their deluſions than any before had done. But though thoſe Shakers are now reduced to a ſmall number, and their power to deceive others ſeems to be gone, yet many who had joined with them have turned off to other deluſions, inſtead of coming into the way of truth. But a few names in Pittsfield are ſtedfaſt in their profeſſion.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. The place now called Hancock was firſt called Jericho, into which a number of Baptiſts mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in 1768, and following years, it being a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before, upon New-York line; and they met for worſhip with a number of brethren who lived over said line, until they choſe to be a ſociety by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, where Steventon church now is. Therefore in June, 1772, fifteen perſons in Hancock joined in covenant as a church of Chriſt, and elder Clarke Rogers became their miniſter, though I have not obtained the date of his ordination. He went from Weſt-Greenwich in the State of Rhode-Iſland, from which State a large number of people went, who planted that northern wilderneſs. In the fall and winter after this church was formed, a powerful work came on among them. They ſay, "There ſeemed to be a remarkable out-pouring of God's Spirit on the people, and the ſaints were much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in his cauſe, while the word, like arrows, pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the hearts of ſinners, who were crying out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilt of ſin; and when ſome obtained deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erance, they were expreſſing the joy of their hearts, viſiting their neighbours, warning them to flee from the wrath to come, and to lay hold on the hope of eternal life. Old and young were bowing to the ſceptre of king Jeſus, and with one united voice ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:030011_0195_0FE3C029673C4FC0"/>Bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, hoſanna in the higheſt. There were open conferences held once a fortnight, to hear the dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larations of any who deſired to join the church; and there was not a conference for many months, but that ſome were added to our number. Twenty were baptized in one day, and fifteen more in about a fortnight. Our number increaſed in one year from fifteen to one hundred and eleven, and other churches were gathered round us, and ſome were given up to them for conveniency, and ſome few were diſciplined and have gone off from us, ſo that our preſent number is ninety-ſix." This account was ſigned Auguſt 13, 1774, by Clark Rogers, elder, David Vaughn, Caleb Carr, William Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs, Jeſſe Southwick, and Ichabod Southwick. But in the moſt trying time of the war, when general Burgoyne ſent out part of his army towards Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington in 1777, and captain Douglaſs collected his company together, ready to march againſt them next morning, ſome of his men went off to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the night, and appeared with them in battle the next day, when ſuch a victory was gained as greatly revived the hearts of the Americans, and Burgoyne and his army were captivated ſoon after. This defection of ſome of the Baptiſts in Hancock cauſed a diviſion in the church, and another was formed and continued many years; but they are lately united again, and one young man who then went to the enemy, hath not only manifeſted repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but alſo ſuch miniſterial gifts, that he is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the paſtor of a large Baptiſt church near the place where Burgoyne was taken. How marvellous are the works of God!</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. A Baptiſt church was formed in Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington in November, 1777, and Mr. John Nichols is their paſtor, who was ordained in 1784. Another church was conſtituted in Sandisfield in Auguſt,
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:030011_0196_0FE3BEAE82E9C9E0"/>1779, and elder Joſhua Morſe became their paſtor. He was born in an uncultivated part of Rhode-Iſland colony, where he never went to any religious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing until he was ſixteen years old; but in hearing the clear preaching of the goſpel ſoon after, he not only became acquainted with experimental religion, but an exhorter of others to regard it, until he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced a public preacher, and he was ordained the paſtor of a church in New-London in Connecticut, May 17, 1750. It was in that part of the town which is now ſet off by the name of Montville. The Stonington Aſſociation met there in 1773, the year after they were firſt formed. Mr. Morſe was much eſteemed, as a clear preacher of the goſpel, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common ſolemnity, and with much ſucceſs. But in the time of the war, his people were much expoſed to the enemy, and many of them removed away, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til their miniſter, by the advice of a council, remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo and ſettled at Sandisfield, where his public miniſtrations, and private converſation, were edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and beneficial, and occaſionally elſewhere, until he died in a joyful manner, in June, 1795, in the ſeventieth year of his age. The other Baptiſt church in that town I have not received a hiſtory of, nor of Great-Barrington and Williamſton.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Bullockſgrant is a tract of land which was granted to ſome men from Rehoboth, which lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Cheſhire and Hawley, but is not yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated as a town. A number of people from Middleborough, Taunton, and Berkley, have alſo removed there, and a number of them joined to the firſt church in Cheſhire. But a powerful work came on among them, and a Baptiſt church was formed, and Mr. Nathan Haſkins was ordained their paſtor, January 28, 1789. He went from Berkley in the county of Briſtol, and many bleſſings have been granted under his miniſtry ſince. A Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt church was formed in Weſt-Stockbridge, Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:030011_0197_0FE3C018E242CC38"/>29, 1781, and Mr. Elnathan Wilcox was inſtalled as their paſtor; but they were afterwards broken and ſcattered. Yet a Baptiſt church was gathered in Stockbridge and Weſt-Stockbridge in 1790, and Samuel Whelpley, A. M. was ordained their paſtor. He was graduated by the college at Providence in 1790, and ſtill continues with that people. I have not obtained a particular hiſtory of the other Baptiſt churches in that county.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. But a particular account of the change which was wrought in one perſon, may give a more clear idea of the nature of the work that was going on in thoſe parts. A poor woman who was brought up in the wilderneſs, in ſuch a manner as not to have learned to read, gave the following relation of her experiences, in the time of the revival at Hancock in the fall and winter of 1772, 1773. She ſaid, "I lived in Little-Houſack, and I heard of a wonderful work of God in Jericho, how many were converted, which cauſed me to reflect on my paſt life, which terrified me much. One night I dreamed that the devil was come for me; I thought he came in a flaſh of fire, which ſtruck me down to hell, into great torment; then I lamented my condition, how I had neglected my ſalvation, and now my day was over. Thus I awoke in great ſurpriſe, and told my huſband, who told me not to regard it, for dreams were nothing. But my guilty conſcience terrified me ſo that I could have no reſt, day nor night: my ſins appeared very heinous, until I thought I could not live long under ſuch horror. I went one day to meeting at Jericho, and thought I would never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn till I had found ſome relief, for I could not live ſo; and I went and heard the number of fifteen tell the dealings of God with them; and they would tell my heart, only they had found deliverance, and I had not, which made me think there was no mercy for me: I was an undone creature, and my ſins ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:030011_0198_0FE3C024106AA300"/>more heinous than before. There was a lecture in the evening, and I went to hear it, and the miniſter preached very powerfully, and inſtead of yielding me any relief, it added to my torment. I I thought I had one more ſermon to account with God for, unleſs I obtained pardon through Jeſus Chriſt, which I thought was not for me, I had been ſuch a great ſinner. My load was ſo heavy that I thought I could not bear up under it. I called my ſiſter out of meeting, and told her that I felt ſo that it ſeemed as though I could not live. She gave me but little anſwer, and meeting being over, I went to a houſe to lodge, and the people were talking of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but I was no company for them. I felt like a loneſome monument of God's diſpleaſure. I got but a little ſleep that night. Next morning I ſet out to go home, and theſe words were uſhered into my mind, Turn, O ſinner, why will you die? But I thought I had done all that I could, and there was no mercy for me; then theſe thoughts came into my mind, You have not given up your heart to God; and I found my whole heart to be a ſink of ſin, and that I had been at enmity againſt a juſt and holy God all my life long, and that God was angry with the wicked every day; and I ſaw myſelf to be ſuch a creature that I wondered that he would ſuffer me to walk on his footſtool. I wondered that the earth did not open and ſwallow me up; as I paſſed along I was afraid that every tree would fall on me and daſh me to pieces, and I would run to get clear of one, and the fear of another would take me. Still theſe words would follow me, Turn, O ſinner, why will you die? At length I was brought to view the juſtice of God, and that I was a rebel juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and had been provoking God to anger all my life long, and was now about to receive the juſt reward of my deeds, and could only plead guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, on which conſideration I was brought to
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:030011_0199_0FE3C1FB0452E348"/>yield myſelf into his hands, with this repeated cry Mercy, Lord, mercy if poſſible; though I could ſee no way that God could be juſt and ſhew mercy to ſuch a wretch as I was. While I was, as it were, ſinking with theſe melancholy thoughts, thoſe words were uſhered into my mind in a remarkable manner, Ye believe in God, believe alſo in me. Theſe words gave me ſome glimpſe of hope. The heft of my burden ſeemed to be taken away, and I felt calm and peaceable, but could not tell what it might be. I thought that if I was converted I ſhould ſee Chriſt, and I would go out in the evening, and look on the firmament, expecting to ſee Chriſt; but then theſe words were uſhered into my mind, Peace to all the children of God, and peace to thy ſoul. Then I went in and got the Bible, for my huſband to try to learn me to read, and I could ſpell a little: and as I then to read I thought the Lord aſſiſted me in reading; and I ſaid, Huſband, it ſeems to me that the Lord aſſiſts me in reading, I never could read ſo before. I had no ſooner ſpoken than my ſoul was filled with divine love, yea, more than full. I thought there was enough for all the world to ſwim away unto the bliſsful ſhores of eternal day. My tongue broke out in raptures of praiſe, crying, Glory, glory to God in the higheſt! for he hath redeemed my ſoul from the horrible pit! I thought I wanted to tell all the world of the fulneſs there was in Chriſt."</p>

The ſame power had before granted the charter of the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, which extended three miles north of every part of Merrimack river, which they conſtrued ſo as to reach a line from the head of the river to Caſco Bay. And though New-Hampſhire was taken from them in 1680, yet they exerciſed a power beyond it afterwards. In 1681 a number of men came from Kittery to Boſton, and joined to the Baptiſt church there, one of whom was William Screven, to whom they gave an approbation to preach the goſpel, Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary 11, 1682. But he was perſecuted for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thoſe parts, by miniſters and rulers. Yet older Hull and others were ſent from Boſton, by the
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:030011_0201_0FE3C05916CE97B0"/>requeſt of thoſe people, to organize a church among them. Our firſt volume, p. 502—505. And a church was conſtituted in Kittery, September 25, 1682, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of William Screven, elder, Humphry Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, deacon, Robert Williams, John Morgandy, Richard Cutts, Timothy Davis, Leonard Drown, William Adams, Humphry Azell, George Litten, and a number of ſiſters. Elder Screven and others were repeatedly carried to courts, where ſentences were paſſed againſt them, of fines and impriſonment, until they removed from ſuch perſecutors; and Screven went to South-Carolina, and became the paſtor of the Baptiſt church in Charleſton, from whence he wrote to Mr. Ellis Callender, of Boſton, June 2, 1707. He wrote again to him, Auguſt 6, 1708, and ſaid, "I rejoice that you are inclined to, and employed in the bleſſed work of the Lord, for the ſupport of his cauſe and the comfort of his faints, left of that poor languiſhing church with you."

               <p n="2">II. There was a revival of religion in Berwick about the time that there was through a great part of the country, and after Mr. Hezekiah Smith was ſettled at Haverhill, he was ſent for to Berwick, in 1767, and baptized a conſiderable number; and he went again the next year and aſſiſted in forming a Baptiſt church there, June 28, 1768. Mr. Joſhua Emery was their teacher, though he was not ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and they gave in certificates of their ſociety ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to law, and yet were taxed to pariſh miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ſpoiling of goods or impriſonment was
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:030011_0202_0FE3C0A69FC34578"/>fiercely purſued for ſome years, for the collection of thoſe taxes, until ſome trials in courts put a ſtop thereto. Our ſecond volume, p. 263. A diviſion took place in this church and ſociety a few years after, and Mr. Emery preached to one part, and Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Hooper was ordained paſtor of the other, Auguſt 14, 1776, in which office he hath continued ever ſince. He was born at Berwick, February 28, 1747, but he reſides at Madbury, where is a branch of this church, and he preaches part of his time at each place. Sanford is above Berwick, where a Baptiſt church was formed, and Mr. Pelatiah Ting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, who went from Attleborough, was ordained there, October 22, 1772. But he afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to Waterborough, where he is paſtor of a church that is not in full fellowſhip with moſt of our Baptiſt churches; though another church was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that town in their fellowſhip, and Mr. Henry Smith was ordained their paſtor in 1794. A Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt church was formed at Wells, in 1780, and Mr. Nathaniel Lord, of Berwick, was ordained their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Dr. Moſes Hemmenway lives in that town, whoſe writings have been before mentioned. A Baptiſt church was formed in Coxhall, October 29, 1782, and Mr. Simon Lock was ordained their paſtor, December 18, 1783. Mr. Tozer Lord, an older brother to Nathaniel, was ordained in a church at Lebanon, above Berwick, in 1776; but that church is diſſolved, and he now is miniſter of a church in Shapleigh. Another church was formed in that town in 1785, and Mr. Nehemiah Davis is their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Mr. Zebadiah Richardſon was miniſter of the church at Sanford in 1788, who is now paſtor of a church in Fryburgh, on the weſt borders of the county of York. There was a powerful work in Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh in 1788, from whence above twenty perſons joined to Sanford church. A Baptiſt church was formed in Corniſh in 1792</p>

III. The firſt Baptiſt church in the county of Cumberland was formed at Goreham, by aſſiſtance from Haverhill, June 20, 1768. Mr. Smith, of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verhill, had been ſent for, and baptized ſome perſons there the fall before. An account of their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings is in our ſecond volume, p. 279. It is ſaid that a majority of them have ſince embraced the opinion of general redemption, and yet hold to the final perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the ſaints; and they are not in fellowſhip with moſt of our churches. A Baptiſt church was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in New-Glouceſter in May, 1782, and they tried various ways to get clear of oppreſſion from the Congregational party, and to ſupport their own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, until they applied to our legiſlature, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an incorporation of a Baptiſt ſociety, inveſted with all the powers and privileges of other pariſhes. But in about four years many of them found this to be ſuch a bondage, that they renounced the ſcheme, and formed a new Baptiſt church in October, 1794, and they joined to the Bowdoinham Aſſociation in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, 1795. A number of people in Harpſwell had experienced a happy change in former times, and a freſh revival began among them in 1783, which led on to the forming of a Baptiſt church there, January 20, 1785. Mr. James Potter had laboured with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs among them, and on October 6, 1785, he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained there as a travelling miniſter; and Mr. Samuel Woodward who was raiſed up among them, was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained their paſtor in October, 1792. In the mean time ſuch a rain of righteouſneſs was granted in thoſe parts, as cauſed the wilderneſs to become a fruitful field; and three churches were formed in one year. Thoſe of Hebron and Buckfield were formed in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, and that of Paris in November, 1791; and Mr. James Hooper, brother to William, was ordained at Paris, June 25, 1795. Mr. Samuel Flagg, who went from Boſton, is preaching at Hebron. Mr. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Cummings, who was educated in the college at Providence, where he took his firſt degree in 1776,
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:030011_0204_0FE3C03FF64B23B0"/>preached for ſome years in the Congregational way, until he was convinced that believers' baptiſm was the way that Chriſt inſtituted, and was baptized in March, 1783; and in the ſpring of 1787 he remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the county of Cumberland, and preached ſo much in the pariſh of Freeport, that they gave him a good farm, but he could not be ordained as a pariſh miniſter becauſe he could not ſprinkle infants. He hath travelled and preached in many of our new plantations, but a number of perſons were baptized in North-Yarmouth in the fall of 1795, who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to form a church there, and to call him to be their miniſter. He lately publiſhed a diſcourſe upon baptiſm. The late revival was powerful in Liver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and a Baptiſt church was formed there, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 7, 1793. Two brethren, Eliſha Williams and Otis Robinſon, are preachers among them, though not ordained. The firſt of them is a ſon of Dr. Williams, of Eaſt-Hartford, and was educated at Yale college; but the ſpiritual teaching which he hath received in that wilderneſs, he prefers above all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man learning. The other went from Attleborough. A Baptiſt church was formed at Sudbury Canada, Auguſt 30, 1795.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The great collection of the waters of the riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Kennebeck and Androſcoggin, with the rivers that fall into them, were called Sagadahock. A number of men came from England, and began a plantation there in 1607, thirteen years before our fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at Plymouth, but they went back again the next year. But the colony of Plymouth obtained a grant from England of a tract of land of fifteen miles wide on each ſide of Kennebeck river, where they carried on a trade with the Indians from 1630 to 1661, when they ſold the ſame to four men. Though in the mean time after the parliament of England had prevailed againſt the king who made thoſe grants of American lands, particular men obtained deeds of a
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:030011_0205_0FE3C062CDF7D228"/>great part of them from Indian Sachems, until an agent for the Maſſachuſetts bought the whole of Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges's grant of his heirs in 1676, and then thoſe lands were claimed by this government. And the charter of 1691 gave them all the lands from thence to Nova-Scotia, and this government have been often granting lands ſince to particular men unto this time. So that a great part of the ſame lands have been claimed by grants from the crown, by deeds from the Indians, and by grants from the legiſlature of the Maſſachuſetts. Unſpeakable troubles and coſts of courts have been cauſed by theſe oppoſite claims, and when theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies will all be ſettled no man can tell. A gentleman who was born in Berwick, but now lives in Boſton, and is attorney-general for this State, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a hiſtory of the diſtrict of Maine in 1795, which gives much light into theſe affairs. Yet he appears to be not ſo clear in religious matters. For he ſays, "There never was any thing like perſecution in the diſtrict of Maine, nor was there much paine taken, in the ſettlement of it, to eſtabliſh a regular ſupport for the clergy: the want of this was a great injury to the people, for experience fully advocates the point, that without a regular fixed mode of eſtabliſhing teachers of piety, religion and morality, a country can never be made virtuous and happy." And yet he afterwards ſays, "In the preſent ſtate of our gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernments in America, and in the enlightened age in which we live, religious opinions, however ſtrongly they may be expreſſed, or however forcibly they may be urged, can do us no hurt."<note n="*" place="bottom">Sullivan's Hiſtory, p. 79, 232.</note> But all ought to know, that reviling and lying as well as ſpoiling of goods and impriſonment, for matters of conſcience, are perſecution in the ſight of God. Matt. v. 10, 11. Heb. x. 32—34. And have there been nothing like theſe in the diſtrict of Maine? And if religious opinions can do no hurt in our governments, how can teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:030011_0206_0FE3C0ABA1E0B2F0"/>of piety, religion and morality do any good therein? For theſe virtues are plainly deſcribed in the word of God, who ſays, If any have children or nephews, let them learn firſt to ſhew piety at home, and to requite their parents. 1 Tim. v. 4. Pure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and undefiled, before God and the Father, is this, To viſit the fatherleſs and widows in their afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to keep himſelf unſpotted from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ld. James i. 27. Therefore all things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them; for this is the law and the prophets. Matt. vii. 12. This is God's deſcription of piety, religion and morality; but all men who ſupport religious worſhip by force, violate theſe rules, more or leſs. The nation of Iſrael was the only viſible church in the world which God empowered to uſe the ſword in religious affairs; all adulterers, idolaters and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers were to die without mercy. And when Chriſt by his death had aboliſhed all hereditary diſtinctions among mankind, and built his church of thoſe who were born again among all nations, the power of his goſpel daſhed the great Roman empire to pieces, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any help from the ſword of the magiſtrate. But myſtery Babylon was built, by confounding na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and grace, church and world together. And when the fathers of the Maſſachuſetts fled from her tyranny to America, they formed a government in imitation of the church of Iſrael, and they made a law to put all adulterers to death, the year after they firſt came to Boſton. And they had plain ſcripture for it, if the church of Chriſt is in the ſame covenant that God made with Abraham; for by that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant all adulterers were to be put to death, and all baſtards were excluded from the church. Levit. xx. 10. Deut. xxiii. But the circumciſion of the heart is eſſentially neceſſary, to give any perſon a right in the church of Chriſt. Therefore an inſpired apoſtle ſays, Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:030011_0207_0FE3C067B47BE9C0"/>of the conciſion. For we are the circumciſion, who worſhip God in the ſpirit, and rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh. Phil. iii. 3, 3. All men who truſt in any arm of fleſh, are curſed with blindneſs, ſo as not to ſee when good cometh; but they who truſt in the Lord, and make him their hope, are like trees planted by a river, whoſe leaf ſhall be green, and they ſhall not ceaſe from yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruit. Jer. xvii. 5—8. And all mankind are in one or the other of theſe two claſſes.</p>

Mr. James Potter was born there in 1734, and was awakened to ſome ſenſe of ſin when he was about ten years old; and convictions followed him, from time to time, until a clear deliverance was granted him, October 3, 1781. And he ſays, "Now I began to ſee the baſe views I formerly had of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and of the plan of ſalvation; for when I had a diſcovery of actual ſins, and of the danger I was expoſed to thereby, I would repent and reform, and think what a glorious Saviour Chriſt was, and that ſome time or other he would ſave me from hell, and take me to glory, with a deſire to be happy, but no deſire to be holy. But, glory be to God! he now gave me another view of ſalvation. Now I ſaw his law to be holy and loved it, though I and all my conduct were condemned by it. Now I ſaw that God's juſtice did not ſtrike againſt me as his creature but as a ſinner; and that Chriſt died not only to ſave from puniſhment, but from ſin itſelf. I ſaw that Chriſt's office was not only to make men happy, but alſo to make them holy, and the plan now looked beautiful to me, and I had no deſire to have the leaſt tittle of it altered, but all my cry was to be conformed to this glorious plan."

And in the ſpring Mr. Lock was ſent for from Coxhall, and a Baptiſt church was formed in Bowdoinham, May 24, and another at Thomaſton May 27, 1784. And Mr. Macomber was ordained the paſtor of the firſt of theſe churches, Auguſt 18, 1784, while Mr. Caſe was ſettled as the paſtor of the other, having been ordained before. Macomber was ſon to a Congregational deacon in Middleborough, but joined to the firſt Baptiſt church there in 1772, began to preach in 1774, and laboured in various parts of the country, until he ſettled where he now
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:030011_0209_0FE3BB18611F4368"/>is. Caſe was born in Rehoboth, February 25, 1761, met with a change in December, 1779, began to preach in July, 1780, and was an early member of the Baptiſt church of Dighton, where he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained September 10, 1783, and went directly into thoſe parts, where he is ſtill uſeful. As there was a great field for labour, and Mr. Eliſha Snow, of Thomaſton, was called into the work, their elders and brethren met at Harpſwell, June 11, 1788, and ordained him as an itinerant miniſter. On the 29th of the ſame month a Baptiſt church was formed in Vaſſalborough, and another at Bowdoin in the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And a Baptiſt church was formed at Ballſton, January 3, 1789. The churches of Bowdoinham, Thomaſton, and Harpſwell, began their Aſſociation in 1787, which had become ſix churches in Auguſt, 1790, and 317 members.</p>

Theſe new churches in a wilderneſs had the powers of the world againſt them, and alſo many under the Baptiſt name, who gathered ſome church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es who held to doctrines which they could not have followſhip with, while they had many difficulties among themſelves. Yet God was pleaſed to grant a freſh revival among them. The ſecond. Baptiſt church in Bowdoin was conſtituted, Auguſt 17, 1791, and Mr. William Stinſon was ordained their paſtor July 5, 1792. Another church was formed in Sidney, June 20, 1791, and Mr. Aſa Wilbur was ordained their paſtor, November 13, 1793. Mr. Lemuel Jackſon, a member of that church, was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained as a travelling miniſter the ſame day. The firſt of them was born in Bridgewater, the other in Middleborough in the county of Plymouth. Mr. Potter was very ſucceſsful in Lewiſton, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his public labours, and many joined to his church from thence, until they obtained a regular
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:030011_0210_0FE3C0B524A22898"/>diſmiſſion, and a church of 22 members was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Lewiſton, March 3, 1792. And on Auguſt 3, 1793, thirteen of their members were diſmiſſed, and formed a church in Greene. They alſo diſmiſſed fourteen more, who formed the third church in Bowdoin, February 13, 1794, at which time they had 59 members left. And they ſay, "It appears that elder James Potter, and elder William Stinſon, were the inſtruments that the Lord bleſſed in the awakening the greateſt part of theſe, who appear to have been brought out of nature's darkneſs into the glorious liberty of the goſpel." A Baptiſt church was formed at Readfield May 11, 1792, and elder Caſe removed and became their paſtor, leaving the church in Thomaſton under the care of elder Snow. And on July 27, 1792, a church was formed in Stirling, now called Fayette, and elder Eliphalet Smith became their paſtor. He was converted at Stratham in 1764, and was ordained the paſtor of a Congregational church in Deerfield in New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, in January 1770, though he and the majority of his church became Baptiſts in June following. Our ſecond vol. p. 267. But in ſome years after he removed into the county of Lincoln, and now became the paſtor of this church. A Baptiſt church was formed on Miſcongus Iſland, near Briſtol, in 1792, and Mr. Andrew Fuller, who went from Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleborough, was ordained therein, October 30, 1793. Another church was formed at Cuſhing in 1792, and Mr. Ephraim Hall was ordained their paſtor October 24, 1793. A Baptiſt church was formed at Nobleborough July 25, 1793, another at New-Sandwich January 9, 1794, and a third at Barretſtown in December following. As many of the Baptiſts have removed from Martha's Vineyard to Sandy-River, a high branch of the Kennebeck, they have called their town New-Vineyard, and they formed a Baptiſt church there Auguſt 8, 1795.

But as a ſon of Gideon by his concubine, ſlew ſeventy of his lawful children, ſo one error of our fathers has prevailed againſt all their good principles and conduct. And all men who are now contending for the faith which was once delivered to

We have alſo heard of ſome Baptiſts in Gouldſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, and Canaan, in this county, as well as of ſome in the county of Waſhington, but have not any ſuch accounts of them as may be of ſervice to the public.

               <p n="1">1 THE firſt civil government upon earth, ſince the riſe of antichriſt, which gave equal liberty of conſcience, was begun in Providence; and there was alſo the firſt Baptiſt church in America. Mr. Roger Williams was born in Wales, in 1599, was educated at Oxford univerſity, and was introduced into the miniſtry in the church of England for ſome years, before he came over to America, and landed at Boſton in February, 1631. When he came there, he could not agree with the ruling party, in their uſe of the ſword in religious affairs, nor in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the grant of American lands from the kings of England. This cauſed his going to Plymouth, where he preached above two years, and then he was called and ordained at Salem; but the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy aroſe ſo high between him and the teachers and rulers of the Maſſachuſetts, that they paſſed a ſentence of baniſhment againſt him in October,
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:030011_0215_0FE3C06CDF17FDD0"/>1635, and in January, 1636, they attempted to ſeize him and ſend him back to England, but he fled to Rehoboth, and from thence to Providence, where he obtained a grant of lands from the Narraganſet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.<note n="*" place="bottom">Winthrop's Journal, p. 91, 92.</note> And he ſays, "I was ſorely toſſed, for four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen weeks, in a bitter winter ſeaſon, not knowing what bread or bed did mean."<note n="†" place="bottom">Collections of the Hiſtorical Society at Boſton, Vol. I. p. 276.</note> Yet he was ſo far from ſeeking any revenge upon thoſe who baniſhed him, that, at the hazard of his life, he went into Narraganſet, and prevented the Indians there from joining with the Pequots, who were for driving all the Engliſh out of the country, when Boſton was not ſeven years old. And any man who will read the books referred to in the margin, may ſee that Williams was a chief inſtrument of ſaving all the Engliſh then in New-England from ruin; though miniſterial influence was ſo great in the Maſſachuſetts as to exclude him from liberty of coming into their government all his days. But the very year after Williams died in peace, the Maſſachuſetts charter was taken away, and the king of England claimed all their lands, and his governor and council made laws, and impoſed taxes upon them, without any houſe of rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentatives, and introduced the taxes upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, which finally brought on the late war. Mr. Williams, having obtained a deed of the lands in Providence, gave twelve men an equal right therein with himſelf, and he drew a covenant of ſuch a gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment in the town in civil affairs, as excluded them from governing in religious matters. And becauſe Joſhua Verin refuſed to allow liberty of conſcience to his wife, he was excluded from the privilege of voting in the town, until he granted that liberty. Upon this Verin removed to Barbadoes, and left his eſtate in Providence.<note n="‡" place="bottom">In Winthrop's Journal he is called Urdin, p. 167. But it is Veria in Providence Records.</note> As Williams and a number
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:030011_0216_0FE3C0C0A219DFA8"/>of his friends were convinced that profeſſing believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were the only goſpel ſubjects of baptiſm, they formed a Baptiſt church in Providence, in March, 1639, when one of them baptized him, and then he baptized the reſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">Winthrop, p. 176</note> But the unruly paſſions of ſome among them, with other things, cauſed ſuch ſcruples in Williams's mind, in about four months, that he refrained from adminiſtering or partaking of ſpecial ordinances in any church ever after, as long as he lived, though he would preach the goſpel, and join in ſocial worſhip with ſuch as agreed with him, all his days. The reaſons of this conduct may be ſeen in our firſt volume, p. 143, 144. He went to England in 1643, and publiſhed an account of the Indians, of their language, and of his labours to inſtruct them concerning Chriſtianity, which the Hiſtorical Society at Boſton have lately re-printed. He procured a charter for his colony the next year, and went to England again to defend it in 1651, where he ſtayed until 1654, when he returned, and was elected their chief ruler for near three years; and all his life after was ſpent in ſeeking the good of his country, till he died in the ſpring of 1683.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Mr. Thomas Olney, who had been a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Congregational church in Salem, but left them and came to Providence in 1638, was the next paſtor of this Baptiſt church, and was alſo uſeful in civil offices, until his death in 1682. But a diviſion aroſe in this church in 1652, about laying on of hands upon every member of the church after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. Ten years before, the Baptiſts in England had adopted the opinion, that every man who had a gift given him to preach the goſpel, had alſo a right to baptize, even before he was ordained in any church; which opinion was held by ſome men of note in Providence for eighty years after. Mr. William Wickinden was a chief leader in that part
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:030011_0217_0FE3C0710DDB1A98"/>of the church in Providence who held to the laying on of hands upon each member, which they ſuppoſed to be intended in the ſixth chapter of the Hebrews; and he was an eſteemed miniſter therein, until he died, February 23, 1669. Gregory Dexter was preſident of this colony in 1653, and he was very uſeful in government, and a father in this church, and lived to be 91 years old. Pardon Tillinghaſt was "a leading man among the Baptiſts in Providence," in 1672;<note n="*" place="bottom">Williams's Diſpute with the Quakers, p. 208.</note> and he was much eſteemed as a miniſter among them, until his death in 1718. He gave the lot upon which their firſt meeting-houſe was built. Chad Brown was an early member of this church, and he is ſaid to have been a teacher among them. And his ſon John Brown was a miniſter in this church, as well as a uſeful man in the State. And his ſon James Brown was a paſtor of this church for many years, and died October 28, 1732, aged 66. His ſon James had four ſons, three of whom have been at great expenſe towards the college in Providence, and towards the Baptiſt meeting-houſe there, as well as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His brother Ebenezer Jencks was ordained a paſtor of this church in 1719, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo until his death, Auguſt 14, 1726, Aet. 57. His ſon Daniel Jencks, and grandſon John Jencks, were both members of this church, and were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſeveral offices in the government, and alſo gave very liberally towards the college, and for the ſupport of the Baptiſt cauſe in Providence. Deacon Samuel Winſor was ordained a paſtor of this church
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:030011_0218_0FE3C0C59B7173A0"/>in 1733, and continued in that office until he died, November 17, 1758, aged 71. His ſon Samuel Winſor was ordained his ſucceſſor, and continued with this church until after preſident Manning came to Providence, and then, in 1771, he, with a number more of the church, went and formed another church in Johnſton, where he yet is miniſter. Mr. Thomas Burlingham was alſo ordained in this church in 1733; but he preached the latter part of his time in Cranſton, where he died, January 7, 1770, aged 82. After elder Winſor and his brethren had formed their church in Johnſton, this church in Providence ſent a committee to treat with them about their right in their old meeting-houſe, and they agreed to take two hundred dollars, which was given them accordingly. This ſummary hath been col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the beſt light that could be obtained, for no regular records have been found in this church before the year 1770.</p>
               <p n="3">III. James Manning, D. D. was born at Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth-Town in New-Jerſey, October 22, 1738; was early changed by grace, and joined to the Baptiſt church in the town where he was born. His educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his ſervice in the college, have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed before, but we ſhall ſpeak more of him as a miniſter of the goſpel. He was called to that work, and was ordained as an itinerant miniſter, by the church where he was baptized; and he removed to Warren in the ſummer of 1764, and a Baptiſt church was formed there the 15th of October following, and he became their paſtor. But when the college was removed to Providence, in the ſpring of 1770, he went with it, and was frequently invited to preach in the Baptiſt church there, until elder Winſor, and a part of the church, drew off in the ſummer of 1771, and formed another church in Johnſton, and then elder Manning was choſen to preach and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter ordinances to this church in Providence;
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:030011_0219_0FE3C076C031F510"/>and he continued ſo to do, until he reſigned that office in the ſpring of 1786, although he miniſtered to them occaſionally afterwards as long as he lived. And though his powers of mind and human accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments were very great, yet he uſed great plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpeech, and was as eaſily underſtood by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, as almoſt any preacher in the land. And few men ever prized the ſpecial influence of the Spirit of God in preaching, more than he did. He was at the Philadelphia Aſſociation in October, 1774, where he met with Mr. Daniel Friſtoe from Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, whom he heard afterwards, with ſuch clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, life and power, though not a man of liberal education, as fired his ſoul with freſh zeal and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in preaching ſalvation to periſhing ſouls; and Mr. Manning laboured with ſuch faithfulneſs and ſucceſs, after his return to Providence, that he baptized an hundred and ten perſons by September, 1775; and a large number more joined to Mr. Snow's church, even notwithſtanding the confuſions of war which then broke out in our land. And when gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor Cooke was choſen member of the college cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, and ſome ſcrupled whether he could prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly be denominated a Baptiſt, becauſe he was a member of a Congregational church, he informed them that he was ever a Baptiſt in principle, and was baptized by immerſion, and ſhould have joined to the Baptiſt church in Providence, if ſuch doctrine had been preached therein then as there was now. Preſident Manning made it his conſtant practice, to charge his ſcholars, when they left the college, not to imagine that they were qualified to preach the goſpel, until they were ſatisfied that they were taught of God. At the commencement in September, 1789, he ſaid, "Should the Chriſtian miniſtry, with any of you become an object, reflect on the abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of intruding into it while ſtrangers to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental religion. See that you yourſelves have been
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:030011_0220_0FE3C0CA87FD4DA8"/>taught of God, before you attempt to teach godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to others. To place in the profeſſional chairs of our univerſities the moſt illiterate of mankind, would be an abſurdity far leſs glaring, than to call an unconverted man to exerciſe the miniſterial func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is to expoſe our holy religion to the ſcoffs of infidels, and furniſh to their hands the moſt deadly weapons. I omit to inſiſt on the account ſuch muſt render in the great tremendous day!" And his conſtant behaviour was agreeable to his teaching; and he united dignity and condeſcenſion, authority and mildneſs, in ſuch a manner as to be ſcared and loved by the generality of his ſcholars. He married a daughter of John Sires, an alderman of Elizabeth-Town, and a uſeful member of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt church there; and ſhe met with a happy change, and joined to the Baptiſt church in Providence, in January, 1775, of which ſhe is ſtill an agreeable member, though ſhe has no children. Dr. Manning died in a ſit of the apoplexy, July 29, 1791, when be, undoubtedly, entered into eternal reſt.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The opinion of laying on of hands upon every member in the church, had long made a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration among the Baptiſt churches in this land; but ſoon after Dr. Manning came to Providence, he prevailed with this church to admit other Baptiſts to occaſional communion with them, though they would receive none as members until after his death. But on Auguſt 4, 1791, the church had a full meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and this point was diſtinctly conſidered, and a clear vote was gained to admit members who did not hold that doctrine. At the ſame meeting the church concluded to have another paſtor ordained therein, namely, Jonathan Maxcy, A. M. He was born in Attleborough, September 2, 1768, educated in the college at Providence, where he took his firſt degree in 1787, and was a tutor in the college, until he met with a change in October, 1789, and joined
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:030011_0221_0FE3C07CA2B54100"/>to this church, in which he began to preach in April, 1790, and was ordained their paſtor, Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 8, 1791. Mr. John Pitman, who was born in Boſton, and had been a miniſter ſome years at Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in New-Jerſey, removed to Providence, and he and his wife were now the firſt members who were received into this church, without holding to the laying on of hands upon every member. He hath frequently preached the goſpel in various places ever ſince, without taking the paſtoral charge of any particular church. Thomas Uſtick, A. M. took his firſt degree in the college at Providence in 1771, was ordained in this church as an itinerant miniſter, July 29, 1777, preached a while at Aſhford, from whence he removed to Grafton in May, 1779, and then to Philadelphia in June, 1782, where he has been paſtor of the Baptiſt church in that city ever ſince. A powerful work of grace came on in Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence in the beginning of 1790, which cauſed the addition of above fifty members to this church in about two years. September 6, 1792, Mr. Maxcy was choſen preſident of the college, pro tempore, and he has been continued in that office ever ſince. He reſigned his paſtoral office in this church two days after he was firſt elected preſident, and they immediately called Mr. Stephen Gano to be their miniſter for ſix months, and he hath been ſo ever ſince. He was ordained before in the State of New-York. Mr. John Gano, his father, was a miniſter in the city of New-York before the late war, but he is now in Kentucky; and he hath been the moſt exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive traveller to preach the goſpel, of any man now living in America. Forty-ſix members have been added to this church in Providence, ſince Mr. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Gano came there; and he drew the circular letter for the Warren Aſſociation in 1795.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The corporation of the college at Providence conſiſts of twelve fellows, and thirty-ſix truſtees.
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:030011_0222_0FE3C0D102D094C0"/>The fellows, as a learned faculty, have the power of conferring the degrees, but in other affairs the college is governed by the concurrence of both branches. The preſident is always to be a Baptiſt, and ſo are ſeven more of the fellows, while the other four may be choſen out of any of the other denominations. Twenty-two of the truſtees are alſo to be Baptiſts, five of them are to be Epiſcopalians, five Quakers, and four Congregationaliſts. The chancellor is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of the truſtees, and the ſecretary out of the fellows. No religious teſt is ever to be required of any of the corporation, nor of the ſcholars who are gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated therein; though great care is to be taken as to the morals of the college. Their firſt funds were collected by Mr. Morgan Edwards, in England and Ireland, and by Mr. Hezekiah Smith, in South-Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olina and Georgia; to which additions have been ſince made from various quarters, but all by perſonal generoſity. Theſe monies were chiefly lent to Rhode-Iſland government, though ſome have been put into a national bank; but the intereſt thereof, with the income from the ſtudents, who are near eighty, is ſcantly ſufficient to ſupport the officers of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.<note n="*" place="bottom">In 1795, they had given degrees to 380 ſcholars who were educated in this college.</note> The building and repairing of the college edifice, the preſident's houſe, with the purchaſe of the lands about them, and alſo the college library and apparatus, were all done by perſonal benefactions, and chiefly in the town of Providence. And ſo was the Baptiſt meeting-houſe, bell and clock, with the lot on which it ſtands, all which coſt about ſeven thouſand pounds. They firſt met in ſaid houſe, May 28, 1775. How falſe then are the pretences of many, that religion and learning would fail from among us if they were not upheld by the power of the magiſtrate! It is readily granted that there has been much religion and knowledge among thoſe
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:030011_0223_0FE3C081C2D29C48"/>who have gone on in that way; but the light and power of the goſpel is directly againſt all deceit or violence. And God ſays of his church, In this mountain ſhall the Lord of hoſts make unto all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a feaſt of fat things, a feaſt of wines on the lees; of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined. And he will deſtroy in this mountain the face of the covering caſt over all people, and the vail that is ſpread over all nations, Iſaiah xxv. 6, 7. A covering and appearance of religion hath been kept up by the power of the magiſtrate, which the feaſt of the goſpel, in the church of Chriſt, will deſtroy.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Ever ſince the reformation in Germany, many have caſt the reproach of all the evils which have appeared among the Baptiſts upon that denom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination in general; which is as unjuſt as it would be for others to charge all the evils that ever were it national churches, upon all men who hold to infant baptiſm. But abuſive treatment on either ſide is exceeding apt to beget prejudices in the mind againſt good principles and conduct, which are held by their oppoſites. And as Calviniſm was held by thoſe who baniſhed the firſt planters of Providence, and of Rhode-Iſland colony, and who greatly abuſed thoſe people all their days, many of their children have imagined that the true liberty of moral agents could not be ſecured upon that plan of doctrine. Though it is abundantly evident, that Mr. Williams, who procured the firſt charter, and Mr. Clarke, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the ſecond, for this colony of liberty, held to that plan of doctrine as firmly as any men in their day. And how can any man enjoy comfort and lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty in his ſoul, in the midſt of the confuſions of the world, without believing that men nor devils can never deceive their faithful God, nor defeat any of his deſigns? That he never makes uſe of any poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive influence to move men to ſin, or to hinder their
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:030011_0224_0FE3C0D5944B34A8"/>coming to Chriſt, I as firmly believe as I believe he is juſt and good; but the luſts of men are ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the wiles of the devil are ſo many, that no man can overcome them of himſelf, though the Spirit of God makes every true believer a conqueror over them all. But as a ſeparation among the Baptiſts in the laſt century, was followed with a departure from theſe ſentiments, and their churches have not been in fellowſhip with moſt of the Baptiſt churches lately gathered in this land, I ſhall ſay but little about them, more than to mention where they are, and who have been their miniſters. Mr. Samuel Fiſk was ordained the paſtor of a Baptiſt church in Scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and continued with them to old age; but I have not obtained the date of his ordination, nor of his death, though he was one of their Aſſociation in 1729. Our ſecond volume, p. 91. Elder Reuben Hopkins was their laſt miniſter, who died in Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, 1792. Elder Peter Place was in their church in Smithfield in 1731, where now is elder John Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Elder Edward Mitchel was in their church in Glouceſter for many years, and he died, October 22, 1795, aged 98. Elder William Bowen was a colleague with him, and now ſucceeds him. Elder Cooke was in their church in Cumberland, where now is elder Bollou. I ſuppoſe the reſt of the churches in their connexion in that county have had but one miniſter, and their names, with the number of their members, are given before, taken from Aſplund's Regiſter for 1794.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. A few people in Glouceſter met with a change about the time of the ſeparations in Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut, and Thomas Knowlton from thence was at the ſeparate ordination in Plainfield, September 11, 1746. A Baptiſt church was afterwards formed in Glouceſter, and he was their miniſter for a number of years. After his death, they had other preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, until Mr. Joſeph Winſor (brother to Samuel)
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:030011_0225_0FE3C0856D45B4D8"/>was ordained their paſtor, October 31, 1763; and they proſpered for a number of years under his min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry, and had ſeventy-nine members when they joined to the Warren Aſſociation in 1782, and had ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe afterwards. But as many have removed into other parts of the country, and their paſtor is ſo aged as not to be able to preach, their number is much reduced, as I am informed, though I have not their preſent number. A Baptiſt church was formed in North-Providence, and Mr. Ezekiel Angell was ordained their paſtor, June 20, 1765; and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo until his death, September 27, 1782, aged 60. Mr. Rufus Teffte, who was born March 14, 1752, was ordained their ſecond paſtor, June 16, 1784. There were but 19 members in this church when their former paſtor died, but a great revival began in the fall of 1791, and prevailed much in the eaſt part of Smithfield, as well as in this town, and their number laſt June, when I was there, was 170. Many of theſe had been brought up in a careleſs neglect of all religion; but we hope that their future life may be as becometh the goſpel. Mr. John Hammond was baptized in 1780, began to gather a church in the town of Foſter in February, 1789, in which he was ordained in June, 1791, and they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to about ninety members in three years. There was a ſecond Baptiſt church in Cumberland above thirty years ago, but they were much broken and ſcattered for ſome years; though there have been revivals ſince, and eſpecially within a few years paſt. A Baptiſt church was formed in Cranſton, and Mr. Eliſha Greene was ordained their paſtor, July 30, 1764. He was born in Warwick, Auguſt 5, 1698, baptized in 1717, began to preach in 1741, and, after a uſeful life, died in Glouceſter, October 29, 1780. This church is now very ſmall. There is another meeting-houſe in Cranſton, upon the great road to Warwick, where Mr. Pitman often
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:030011_0226_0FE3C04F64D5B7D0"/>preaches, and a number of members from thence have joined to the Baptiſt church in Providence.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Mr. John Clarke, a phyſician from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, was one of the firſt planters of Rhode-Iſland, and the paſtor of the ſecond Baptiſt church in Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica, which was formed at Newport in 1644. His brother Joſeph Clarke was a member of it, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a ruler in the State, and adorned his profeſſion for above forty years after the church was conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted; and his poſterity are numerous and reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto this day. Samuel Hubbard was born in England in 1610, came over to Salem in 1633, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Congregational church in Watertown in 1635, but went up to Windſor, and helped to begin the colony of Connecticut the ſame year. But as he and his wife embraced the Baptiſt principles, they removed to Newport, and joined with this church in 1648; and he lived there above forty years after, and preſerved many writings which have been very ſerviceable in our hiſtory. He left no ſon, but he had three daughters, who were married to Joſeph Clarke, junior, Robert Burdick, and Andrew Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, whoſe poſterity are reſpectable to this day, eſpecially among the Baptiſts in Hopkinton. In 1651 Mr. Coddington obtained a commiſſion from the ruling powers in England, to be governor of Rhode-Iſland, without the conſent of the people, when he had the deeds of their lands in his hands. Therefore Mr. John Clarke went to England, with Mr. Roger Williams, and got that commiſſion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annulled; and he was agent for his colony in that country, until he procured their ſecond charter in 1663. Mr. Hubbard wrote a letter to him, the ſpring after he went to England, and Clarke wrote him an anſwer, October 11, 1652, and ſaid, "There can be nothing in the preſent evil world, ſo far as I
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:030011_0227_0FE3C08B1B415B20"/>am acquainted with my own heart as it ſtands to Godward, that is more pleaſing and delightful to it, than the manifeſtation of the enlargement of the kingdom of his dear Son, and that many obedient ſervants are added to the Lord, whom God the Father hath reſolved to exalt above every name that is named, not only in this preſent world, but in that which is to come; and that they who are ſo added, being living members of that body which by a ſpirit of life is joined unto that living Lord who is head over all, may increaſe with all the increaſe of God, is the earneſt deſire and prayer of my ſoul. But I muſt tell you, that as the promiſe of the glorious coming of our Lord doth quicken and freſhen in my heart, ſo doth that prophecy follow in my mind, When the ſon of man cometh, ſhall he find faith on the earth?" He returned to Newport in 1664, and was a faithful paſtor of this church, being alſo uſeful in the State, until he died in a happy frame, April 20, 1676. When Mr. Clarke ſailed for England in 1651, he left the care of this church with Joſeph Tory, and Obadiah Holmes, and they were uſeful teachers therein all their days. Holmes ſucceeded Clarke as paſtor of the church, until he died, Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 15, 1682. Mr. Richard Dingley ſucceeded him; but in 1694, he left them and went to South-Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina. In 1710 Mr. William Peckom was ordained their paſtor, and continued ſo until he died in 1734. He was eſteemed as a pious man, but his gifts were ſmall; and Mr. John Comer was ordained a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league with him, May 19, 1726. He was born in Boſton, Auguſt 1, 1704, met with a happy change in November, 1721, and after obtaining a good ſhare of human learning, he began to preach the goſpel at Swanſea in May, 1724, and went to Newport in the fall of 1725, and preached in this church four years, in which time it increaſed from ſeventeen members to fifty-two. Yet two powerful men in the church,
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:030011_0228_0FE3C0DAAD1D4160"/>prevailed with the majority to vote him a diſmiſſion in 1729, and he went and preached two years in the ſecond church in Newport with conſiderable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and then removed and gathered the firſt Baptiſt church in Rehoboth, where he died, as we before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ted. Mr. John Callender, who was born in Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>, and was educated at the college in Cambridge, was the next paſtor of this church, where he was ordained, October 13, 1731, colleague with elder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>kom. He was a man of ſuperior powers, and publiſhed a century ſermon in 1738, and a funeral ſermon for Mr. Clap, the firſt Congregational min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter in Newport, in 1745, with ſome other things. He alſo collected many papers, which have been ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in our hiſtory. But he was taken away by death, January 26, 1748, in the 42d year of his age. Mr. Edward Upham, of Springfield, at the requeſt of this church, removed to Newport in 1749, and miniſtered to them until April, 1771, when he returned back to Springfield, as we before related. Mr. Eraſmus Kelly, who was born in Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, July 24, 1748, educated at the college in Philadelphia, and began to preach in thoſe parts, was called to Newport, and was ordained a paſtor of this church, October 9, 1771. And the church and ſociety increaſed under his miniſtry, until the enemy came to Newport, and he removed to Warren, where they followed him, and burnt the houſe and goods where he reſided, May 25, 1778. He then removed to Connecticut, and from thence to Pennſylvania. But upon the return of peace, he came again to Newport, and miniſtered to this church, until he was taken away by death, November 7, 1784, before he had been with them a year in this laſt turn. Mr. Joſias Lyndon was of this ſociety, and did much for the ſupport of worſhip therein. He was governor of the colony in 1769, and was very ſerviceable in the State all his days. He died of the ſmall-pox, March
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:030011_0229_0FE3C090B451F778"/>30, 1778, aged 74, leaving much of his eſtate to this church. The calamities of the war ſcattered this church, and others were taken away by death, ſo that only three male members remained at New-port, and but twenty-ſeven, male and female, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained any where, when Dr. Benjamin Foſter came there in January, 1785, and above twenty were add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this church that year, and many to their ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, a number of whom attended no worſhip before. In September, 1786, this church was received into the Warren Aſſociation, when they had 69 members. But in 1788 ſome of them raiſed oppoſition againſt their miniſter, and he had an earneſt call to New-York; therefore he was diſmiſſed from this church, and hath been paſtor of the firſt Baptiſt church in that city ever ſince. After various trials, this church obtained Mr. Michael Eddy, who was ordained in Swanſea, in 1785, but removed to Newport in Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary, 1790, and he is now their paſtor, and they have proſpered under his miniſtry.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The doctrine of laying on of hands upon every member, came into the firſt church in New-port in 1652, and the ſecond church was formed about 1656. Mr. William Vaughan was their firſt paſtor, and continued ſo until his death in Auguſt, 1677. Mr. Thomas Baker ſucceeded him for a time, and then he removed and began a ſociety in North-Kingſton. Mr. John Harden was their third paſtor, who died in the year 1700. Mr. James Clarke was the next, who was ordained in 1701, and continued with them until he died, December 1, 1736, aged 87. Mr. Daniel Wightman was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a colleague with him in 1704. He was born in Narraganſet, January 2, 1668, and died in New-port Auguſt 31, 1750. They were well eſteemed among their brethren, as faithful miniſters, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary walkers; and in January, 1729, when elder Clarke was not able to preach, through the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:030011_0230_0FE3C0E0B8B7ED90"/>of age, Mr. Comer was received to preach one half of the Lord's days with elder Wightman, and continued to do ſo for two years. Their church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to 142 members, being the largeſt church then in their colony. They had built the firſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe in the colony, in 1707. On June 21, 1729, they had the largeſt Aſſociation of Baptiſt miniſters and churches that ever had been ſeen in America. The elders preſent were, James Clarke, Daniel Wightman, and John Comer, of Newport, Jonathan Sprague and James Brown, of Providence, Nicholas Eyers of New-York, Valentine Wightman of Groton, Philip Tabor of Dartmouth, Stephen Gorton of New-London, and Daniel Everet of South-Kingſton. Beſide whom the elders, Peter Place of Smithfield, Samuel Fiſk of Scituate, Joſeph Maſon of Swanſea, Manaſſah Martin of Warwick, and Richard Sweet of North-Kingſton, were in their connexion of churches; and Mr. Comer ſays, "Each of theſe hold to general redemption. Three other churches hold to the doctrine of free grace. One in Newport, formerly my flock; one at Swan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea, Mr. Ephraim Wheaſon; one at Boſton, Mr. Eliſha Callender." And theſe, with one at New-port, and one at Weſterly, who kept the ſeventh day, were all the Baptiſt churches then in New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. Comer gave his ideas of election in theſe words, ſaying, "If God does not chooſe us, we ſhall never be moved to chooſe him. It is from his choice of us that we are led to chooſe him. 1 Pet. ii. 9.2 Theſſ. ii. 13. They are choſen to obedience, and not for obedience. 1 Peter i. 2. We are choſen not in time upon works, but before time excluſive. Eph. i. 4.

His ſon, Dr. Thomas Eyres, was edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated at Yale college, and was one of the firſt fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of our college. Mr. Gardner Thurſton was born in Newport, November 21, 1721, met with a change and joined to this church in 1741, and was ordained their paſtor, April 29, 1759. The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of grace gradually gained ground in this church, and ſinging in public worſhip was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into it in 1765, and many bleſſings have been granted among them ſince. Dr. William Rogers, one of the firſt claſs in our college, was called to preach in this church, and he went to Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adelphia in 1771, where he has been uſeful ever ſince.

               <p n="10">X. The third Baptiſt church in Newport was formed in the following manner. Stephen Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford came over from London in 1664, and brought the opinion with him, that the whole of the ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, as they were delivered from mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai, were moral and immutable; and that it was the antichriſtian power, which thought to change times and laws, that changed the Sabbath from the ſeventh to the firſt day of the week. Several members of the firſt church in Newport embraced this ſentiment, and yet continued with the church for ſome years, until two men and their wives, who had ſo done, turned back to the keeping of the firſt day again.

Thomas Ward was an early member of this church, whoſe ſon Richard was governor of the colony in 1741, 1742; and-his ſon Samuel was governor in 1762 and 1765, and a member of Congreſs in 1774 and 1775, until he died at Philadelphia, March 26, 1776, aged 52.

There have been a number of Baptiſts in Newport for many years, who did not agree fully with either of the old churches in ſome things, but whoſe to meet by themſelves, and to call elders from abroad to miniſter occaſionally to them, until they formed another church in the town.

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we are well informed, that a greater harmony has lately appeared among all denominations in Newport, than was heretofore known among them.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Elder Philip Tabor was paſtor of the Baptiſt church in Tiverton and Dartmouth, before he was impriſoned at Briſtol for not favouring miniſterial tyranny. Both of theſe towns were under the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſette government until 1741; and becauſe the majority of the inhabitants would not receive and ſupport Congregational miniſters, a ſalary for ſuch was put into their State tax, and they were to draw is out of the State treaſury. But their aſſeſſors being informed of it, left that part of the tax on thoſe two towns out of their aſſeſſment. Tabor was one of them, and he, with three aſſeſſors more, were ſeized on May 25, 1723, and were impriſoned at Briſtol until an agent went over to London, and procured their releaſe by an order from the king and council. Our ſecond volume, p. 70—73. He lived within the bounds of Dartmouth, but their meeting was held in the eaſt part of Tiverton, where he miniſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this Baptiſt church, until he died in November, 1752. Mr. David Round was born in Rehoboth,
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:030011_0235_0FE3C13D33AD4368"/>in January, 1706, and was ordained the next paſtor of this church about 1755, and miniſtered to them for many years, and is now living among them, and eſteemed as a pious man. But as his gifts were ſmall, the church called Mr. Peleg Burroughs, from the ſecond church in Newport to preach to them in May, 1775, and he was ordained their paſtor, April 13, 1780. A happy rain of righteouſneſs was then grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them, which cauſed the addition of about an hundred members in two years. Elder Burroughs was born in Newport, June 5, 1748, converted in 1766, and began to preach in 1774; and he is ſtill continued with this church. That revival of relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion cauſed the gathering of a Baptiſt church in the ſouth borders of Freetown, February 15, 1781, and Mr. Amos Burris, from Groton, in Connecticut, was inſtalled their paſtor, May 22, 1783. But in October, 1784, he removed into the State of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, and they removed their meeting into the north borders of Tiverton, where it now is; and two men were raiſed up to preach among them, who were unitedly ordained as their paſtors, May 19, 1796, namely, James Boomer and Job Barden. The latter is blind, as to natural fight, but he hath ſuch ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual light as to be eſteemed a clear preacher of the goſpel.

After ſome time, this church ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Mr. Charles Thompſon to preach to them, and he was ordained their paſtor, July 3, 1771.

And when Mr. Bound, of Boſton, met elder Wightman, of Groton, at Warwick, in 1743, the elders with whom he was connected oppoſed his

In 1678 Mr. Hubbard wrote to a friend in Jamaica, and ſaid, "Our num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber here is twenty, at Weſterly ſeven, and at New-London ten." On December 7, 1681, he wrote to England, that two Indians came to Newport that week from Nantucket, who were Baptiſts, and one of them a preacher, with "a letter of recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from one Peter Folger, a member of our old church," that is, of Mr. Clarke's church.

Mr. David Sprague was born at Hingham, in the Maſſachuſetts, and was converted at Scituate, in this State, where he joined to the Baptiſt church under the care of elder Fiſk. As he was a man of ſuperior gifts, he was invited to preach among them; but a ſenſe of the greatneſs of the work made him afraid to attempt it, until a paſſage of ſcripture was opened with peculiar clearneſs to his mind, and then he came forward and delivered a ſermon. This was very agreeable to his miniſter, and to the people; but when he preached his ſecond diſcourſe, they obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more the tenor of his teaching, and ſaid to him, "If you go on in this way, you will be as bad an <hi>

And his coming forward in preaching as he was firſt taught, cauſed his being ſhut out of the church where he was firſt ordained, and another was formed at Exeter, in the fall of 1750. But as they had before made ſo much of external baptiſm and laying on of hands, they now went over to the other extreme and received one or more to the ordinance of the ſupper without any water baptiſm. The powerful effects of the preaching of ſeparate miniſters from Connecticut, had a great influence to cauſe this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But this raiſed ſuch oppoſition to whom they called <hi>re-baptizing,</hi> in the mind of the paſtor of the ſeparate church in Canterbury, where the ſepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation began, that he, with others, prevailed with ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en or eight teachers to retract their baptiſm by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion. And a council of them cenſured the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the firſt ſeparate church in Middleborough, becauſe he refuſed to follow that example. But this cenſure cauſed the meeting of the delegates of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſeven churches at Exeter, May 23, 1753, who condemned the cenſuring of each other on either ſide. Our ſecond volume, p. 210, 211. Though the diviſions and controverſies that have appeared where believer's baptiſm hath been introduced, hath been held up as a ſtrong argument againſt it from age to age. In 1653 Mr. Henry Dunſter, preſident of the college at Cambridge, gave up infant baptiſm, and preached againſt it in the pulpit there. But Mr. Jonathan Mitchel, paſtor of their church, went to talk with him upon it, after which he ſaid, "I had a ſtrange experience; I found hurrying and preſſing ſuggeſtions againſt pedobaptiſm, and injected ſcruples
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:030011_0244_0FE3C12974D04768"/>and thoughts whether the other way might not be right, and infant baptiſm an invention of men, and whether I might with a good conſcience baptize children, and the like. And theſe thoughts were darted in with ſome impreſſion, and left a ſtrange confuſion and ſicklineſs upon my ſpirit. Yet, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought, it was not hard to diſcern that they were from the EVIL ONE. 1. Becauſe they were rather injected, hurrying ſuggeſtions, than any deliberate thoughts, or bringing any light with them. 2.

It was not now a time to ſtudy that matter; but when in the former part of the week I had given myſelf to that ſtudy, the more I ſtudied it, the more clear and rational light I ſaw for pedobaptiſm; but now theſe ſuggeſtions hurried me into ſcruples. But they made me cry out to God for his help, and he did afterward calm and clear up my ſpirit. I thought the end of them was, Firſt, to ſhew me the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my mind; how apt that was to take in error, even as my heart is to take in luſt. Secondly, to make me walk in fear, and to take hold on Jeſus Chriſt to keep me in the truth; and it was a check to my former ſelf-confidence, and it made me fearful to go needleſsly to Mr. Dunſter; for, methought, I found a venom and poiſon in his inſinuations and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes againſt pedobaptiſm. Thirdly, that I might be mindful of the aptneſs in others to be ſoon ſhaken in mind, and that I might warn others thereof, and might know how to ſpeak to them from experience. And indeed my former experience of irreligious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, was ſome help to me to diſcover the nature of theſe.

The church in Exeter proſpered under the miniſtry of elder Sprague for about ten years, and then he gave up communion in the ordinance of the ſupper with all who were only ſprinkled in infancy, which cauſed his diſmiſſion from this church. He then went and preached a while at New-London, and another ſeaſon on Block-Iſland, which is called New-Shoreham; after which he returned to Exeter, where he died in 1777. His ſon, Solomon Sprague, was early changed by grace, and he was ordained paſtor of this church June 1, 1769.

Elder Babcock was zealous for ſuch a union all his days, while oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers renounced it. He died after the war began in 1775. His ſon Oliver Babcock was his ſucceſſor in that office until he died, February 13, 1784. His couſin Elkanah Babcock was their next miniſter, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the majority of the church rejected him becauſe of his turning off into corrupt principles. In the mean time another church was gathered in Weſterly, about the year 1770, and Mr. Iſaiah Wilcox was ordained their paſtor, who was very zealous for the communion of the two denominations together, and they were a large church when he died in March, 1793. In the fall of 1750, ſuch a church was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in South-Kingſton, and Mr. James Rogers was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained their paſtor, and he continued ſo about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years; but he had entangled himſelf ſo much in the affairs of this life, and was involved ſo deeply in debt, that he went off into the State of New-York, and his church was divided and diſſolved. A num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them, who ſtill hold to mixed communion, have lately had a revival among them, to whom oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have joined, and they are of the Groton confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But in the work which began in 1778, a number gave up mixed communion, and formed a church there, and Mr. Benjamin Weight was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained

Another church aroſe out of the ruins of the former about 1774, who ſince meet in Richmond, and Mr. Benjamin Barber was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained their paſtor in 1793. In another part of Richmond a new church was formed, and Mr. Charles Boſs was ordained their paſtor in June, 1781, and he was well eſteemed in his office until his death in 1789. Theſe three churches do not hold to mixed communion. But when the church in Exeter gave up that practice, deacon Philip Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins drew off from them, and gathered a church in that way, July 21, 1764, and he was ordained their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor the 6th of September following, and is ſtill contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with them. Their meeting is in North-Kingſton. And in the glorious year 1780, religion was revived in the ſouth part of that town, and a new church was gathered, and Mr. William Northup was ordained their paſtor in 1782, and they are now a large church. An Indian Baptiſt church was formed in Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, in this county, above thirty years ago, of which James Symons was paſtor, and then Samuel Niles; and they had many valuable Chriſtians there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;<note n="*" place="bottom">In 1784 Niles's church had about fifty members.</note> but moſt of them are ſince dead, and the church is diſſolved.

Mr. John Gorton was born in Cranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, April 22, 1723, and was ordained a paſtor of this church, September 6, 1753; and he was an acceptable miniſter among them until his death, in 1793. And Mr. Mancheſter, of Coventry, now miniſtereth alſo to this church. Mr. Timothy Greene was formerly the paſtor of a Baptiſt church in Coventry; wherein Mr. Thomas Mancheſter was ordained, September 12, 1782. A church was formed in the weſt part of Warwick, in connexion with theſe, and Mr. David Corpe was ordained their miniſter in 1791. A Baptiſt church had been form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame place about fifty years ago, and Mr. Benjamin Peirce was ordained their paſtor, and they came into fellowſhip with Exeter church and others in 1750. And they increaſed ſo much, that Mr. Peter Werden was ordained a colleague with him, May 21, 1751. And he laboured there until April, 1757, when he removed up to Coventry, by the conſent of the church. After Mr. Peirce's death, Mr. Budlong was their miniſter for a while, and then this church was diſſolved, and many of them removed into other parts of the country. There was a powerful work in Coventry in 1748, and a Baptiſt church was formed there, and Mr. Samuel
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:030011_0249_0FE3C1372D0669B8"/>Drown was ordained their paſtor, October 11, 1749. But in a few years he gave up his Baptiſt principles, and went and ſettled at Portſmouth, in New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, where he practiſed inform baptiſm the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his days. He died there January 17, 1770. After elder Werden removed to Coventry, he min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtered to the church there for twelve years, in which time many were hopefully converted, and Chriſtians were built up in the ways of God, and then, as a large part of his people had removed, he alſo went and ſettled where he now is in Berkſhire. The weſt part of Coventry, and or the towns adjacent, had very little of the appearance of religion among them, until God was pleaſed to pour out his Spirit upon them in the beginning of 1773. Mr. Caleb Nichols was greatly bleſſed in his labours there afterwards. He was born in Weſt-Greenwich in March, 1743, met with a change in 1767, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to preach among this people in 1773, and a church was formed, and he was ordained their paſtor in June, 1774. When the war came on it produced many evil effects; yet in May, 1779, ſuch a revival of religion was granted in theſe parts, that he baptized above ſixty in two months, and his church increaſed to three hundred members in five years. But in the great ſhakings and confuſion which took place in 1786, this church was ſcattered, and many removed into other parts of the land, and elder Nichols was diſmiſſed in the ſpring of 1788, and went and ſettled at Pownal, in Vermont, where he is ſtill uſeful. Mr. Nathaniel Price was raiſed up to preach to this church, and he now holds meetings with ſome of them at the houſe where elder Werden formerly preached, and Mr. John Benſon preaches where Nichols did, though neither of them are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. A Baptiſt church was formed in Weſt-Greenwich in 1773, and Mr. Eliſha Greene was ordained their paſtor, September 21, 1775, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſo ſtill.</p>

XX. A few general remarks ſhall cloſe this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The multiplicity of ſects in this State, has oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en been advanced as an argument againſt the relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions liberty which was granted therein; but there are now about at many ſects in the town of Boſton, as there are in the whole State of Rhode-Iſland. There are ſome in Boſton who pray for ſouls in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, while others boldly preach up the fire of hell as that which will finally purge away all ſin, without the prayers of any in this world. And theſe things are carried the higheſt in Boſton and Philadelphia, of any part of America. A party ſpirit, and bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in election of rulers, were formerly laid as a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>proach on the colony of Rhode-Iſland; but our land is full of theſe evils now, and they have been varried as high as any where in the town of Boſton. Our land hath alſo been filled, in the year paſt, with publications againſt our higheſt rulers, becauſe a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> was ſent to England, and made a treaty with the rulers there, which gives them more power here than they had before. But in the year 1786 two miniſters came over with commiſſions from the biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops in England, and they have made other biſhops the moſt of the United States, to whom monies and ſtands are given by governments; yet moſt men are ſilent about theſe things, or elſe commend them as evidences of candour and catholiciſm in our land. Whereas the biſhops, and their miniſtry in England, who have been ſupported by law, have had more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in their late wars againſt liberty in America and France, than all other men in their nation. But as the government of Rhode-Iſland never grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any lands to religious miniſters, nor ſupported any by tax, all the power of the church of England has raiſed no more than four of their ſocieties in the whole State, and one of them is now nearly diſſolved, if not quite.<note n="*" place="bottom">And biſhop Seabury, who claimed a power there, died in March, 1796, ſtate the firſt part of this book was printed.</note> Governor Jencks was a leader in

Our ſecond volume, p. 48, 114. But a cuſtom was introduced into their government in 1770, of incorporating ſocieties to collect and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age funds of money for the ſupport of religious miniſters; and the hope of obtaining ſuch a fund in Mr. Snow's congregation in Providence, was an evident motive for the ordination there in 1793; which ſhut him out of a houſe that he had as juſt a right in, as any miniſter has to any houſe for worſhip in our land. And the four miniſters from the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts, who acted in that affair, are far from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the people in their own government a power to diſmiſs their miniſter without his own conſent, or elſe the advice of a council whom he had a voice in calling. And according to the word of God, the only miniſters who are to be followed, hold forth Chriſt in their converſation, the ſame yeſterday, and to-day, and forever, and are willing in all things to live honeſtly. Heb. xiii. 7, 8, 18. But how can any man live honeſtly, who eats the bread of others for nought? 2 Theſſ. iii. 7—10. And how can a people live honeſtly, if they require their miniſter to go a warfare at his own charges? 1 Cor. ix. 7—14. Each of which iniquities have long prevailed under the maſk of religion, beyond what they could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have done in any other way.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. CONNECTICUT hath ever had the privilege of chooſing her own rulers, and of making her own laws, as well as Rhode-Iſland; and miniſterial influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was much more mild there at firſt, than it has been in our days. John Hames was the governor of Maſſachuſetts-Bay in 1635, and pronounced the ſentence of baniſhment againſt Roger Williams; but he and Mr. Thomas Hooker went up to Connecticut ſoon after. And when Williams was at his houſe at Hartford, Haines ſaid to him, "I muſt confeſs to you, that the moſt wiſe God hath provided and cut out this part of his world for a refuge and receptacle for all forts of conſciences. I am now under a cloud, and my brother Hooker, with the Bay, as you have been, We have removed from them thus far, and yet they are not ſatisfied."<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtorical Collections at Boſton, Vol. 1. p. 280.</note> No, nor ever could be ſatisfied in that way. For in 1708, a governor who had been a miniſter, and came from the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, obtained an act to ſet up miniſters above all their churches. And in 1742, their miniſters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:030011_0253_0FE3C141CD4BCF00"/>a law to puniſh every man who ſhould preach the goſpel in any pariſh, without the conſent of the pariſh miniſter. And as Mr. John Owen, paſtor of the firſt pariſh in Groton, ventured to preach againſt ſuch proceedings, he was complained of to the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature at Hartford in May, 1743, and an act was paſſed to bring him before them the next October. A reſolve was alſo paſſed, that no perſons of the Preſbyterian or Congregational denominations ſhould have the benefit of the act of toleration, granted to diſſenters from their eſtabliſhment, and that no courts below the legiſlature ſhould have power to admit any to that privilege. Owen avoided being taken in October, when a law was made againſt the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any itinerant miniſter who might come from any other government. And as a complaint was entered againſt Dr. Benjamin Pomroy, of Hebron, for preaching againſt their laws, both he and Owen were ordered to be brought before them the next May. And in May, 1744, both of them were brought before the aſſembly at Hartford, and were compelled to make a confeſſion for ſaid preaching, to pay coſts of proſecution, and Pomroy was bound to his good behaviour. And in the December fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, the miniſters of Windham county ordained a miniſter for the firſt pariſh in Canterbury, againſt the vote of the church there; which began the ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arations in our country, from ſuch miniſters and their churches. And how can any men be juſtly blamed for ſeparating from thoſe who claimed a power above the churches of Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="2">II. The firſt Baptiſt church in Connecticut was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Groton about 1705. Elder Valentine Wight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man came from North-Kingſton, and ſettled in Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and was the firſt paſtor of this church. They ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for a while from the ruling party; but in the glorious year 1741, he and Mr. Owen were agreed in the work which was then going on in the land, and they enjoyed liberty until elder Wightman was taken
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:030011_0254_0FE3C1B8ACA2C200"/>away by death, June 9, 1747, aged 66. He intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſinging in public worſhip into his church, and publiſhed a pamphlet to defend it. And being call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preach in Lyme, Mr. Bulkley, of Colcheſter, came and held a diſpute with him upon baptiſm and the ſupport of goſpel miniſters, June 7, 1727, of which Bulkley publiſhed an account, and Wightman an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered it. Our ſecond volume, p. 89, 90. After his death the church called elder Daniel Fiſk to be their miniſter, and he continued with them ſeven years; but they were then ſo much divided, that many of them gave a new declaration of their experiences, and ſigned new articles of faith and a covenant, June 28, 1754, and elected Mr. Timothy Wightman to be their paſtor, and he was ordained as ſuch, May 20, 1756, and continues ſo ſtill. He is a ſon of their firſt paſtor, and was born November 20, 1719. His brother, John Wightman, was ordained as an evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt by this church, June 15, 1774, and travelled and preached in various parts of the country.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Wightman was a ſhining example of uniform piery and benevolence, until death put an end to his uſeful life, which he ended in the moſt joyful manner at Farmington.</note> A daughter of their firſt paſtor married a Mr. Rathbun, who hath two ſons and two grandſons, who are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Baptiſt miniſters. Elder Timothy Wight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's ſon, Jeſſe, is alſo a Baptiſt miniſter at Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field. A diſpute aroſe in this church in September, 1765, about the nature of ſpiritual teaching and the improvement of gifts, upon which a diviſion enſued, and another church was formed, in which Mr. Silas Burris was ordained; and they held to mixed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muion, and the Groton Conference was named from thence. But a revival of religion was granted in the mother church in 1774, which cauſed the addition of thirty members to it in about a year; and anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er church was formed in the north part of Groton, May 25, 1775, and Mr. Rufus Allen was ordained their paſtor, and they had thirty-ſix members in 1784. But their paſtor died not long after, ſince which their
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:030011_0255_0FE3C14616CB2CB0"/>church is diſſolved. Though the firſt Baptiſt church in Groton had ſeventy-eight members in 1787, and they increaſed to one hundred and fifty-eight in two years, and to one hundred and eighty two in 1794, beſide all that have died, have been diſmiſſed or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
               <p n="3">III, The ſecond Baptiſt church in Connecticut was formed at New-London, and Mr. Stephen Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton was ordained their paſtor November 28, 1726. He was a man of conſiderable gifts, and was miniſter there for many years; but he fell into ſome ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous conduct, and his church was finally diſſolved. It was in that part of the town where the church now is, who keep the ſeventh day as the Sabbath, of whom we have ſpoken before. In January, 1744, elder Timothy Peckom baptized ſome perſons in the heart of the town, and ſome more at Saybrook, for which he was put in priſon; and a church was gathered a year or two after, of the two denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions together; and Mr. Noah Hammond was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in this church in July, 1754, who afterwards was paſtor of a church on Long-Iſland, where he died in October, 1774. Elder Leſter was alſo of this church, who is now at Saybrook. Another church was formed, and Mr. Joſhua Morſe was ordained their paſtor, May 17, 1750, who in the time of the late war removed to Sandisfield, and Mr. Reuben Palmer is miniſter in that place, which now is called Montville. Mr. Zadock Darrow was an early teacher in the firſt of theſe churches, of which he hath been paſtor many years. He was born in December, 1728, and his church gave up mixed communion in 1790. and there was ſuch a revival among them in 1794 as cauſed the addition of ninety-one members in one year. John Rogers began a ſect in this town in 1677, upon the following principles. As to language and dreſs they held with the Quakers, but they held the external uſe of baptiſm and the ſupper as the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:030011_0256_0FE3C1BCECF66FE0"/>do. But they held that the eſtabliſhing the firſt day of the week as the Sabbath was idolatry, and they took much pains to pull it down, by teſtifying againſt it, and interrupting others in their keeping it. They were alſo earneſtly ſet againſt ſupporting min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters by law; and they ſuffered much for their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to theſe two practices; and they were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in refuſing to employ any phyſicians in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or midwives for women in travail, holding that they were to be healed or delivered by the prayer of faith. But as a few of them were left to put an end to their own lives, and rulers have been ſo wiſe of late as to avoid their former ſeverities towards them, their ſociety is nearly diſſolved, and many of their children are very uſeful men in various parts of the country. Three brethren of one family are deacons in three Baptiſt churches.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The work of the Spirit of God in our land in 1741, was very powerful in Stonington, where there were three Congregational ſocieties, with min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters in each of them. Two of thoſe miniſters fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the work as long as their churches were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed thereby; but a new piece of cloth, if put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an old garment, makes the rent worſe, and new wine will burſt old bottles, as our Lord obſerves to thoſe who were building upon their own doings and traditions. Luke v. 31—38. Such oppoſition appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the late work, and elder Wightman was ſo clear in it, that a number of people were baptized and formed a church in Stonington, and Mr. Wait Palmer was ordained their paſtor in September, 1743. And after the ſeparation began at Canterbury, it ſpread into Stonington, and a church was formed there, and Mr. Matthew Smith was ordained their paſtor, December 10, 1746; and he continued with them until the ſpring of 1749, and then left them and removed out of the town. And many embraced believers' baptiſm and went and joined to elder Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock's
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:030011_0257_0FE3C14B2B5EC498"/>church in Weſterly; and when Mr. Paine had determined to uſe all his influence to ſtop the prevalence of the Baptiſt principles in their ſeparate churches, he and Babcock joined in writing letters to all their churches; and delegates from forty churches met at the houſe of Mr. Simon Drown, of Stonington, May 29, 1754, and ſpent three days in hearing the controverſies between the two parties. Mr. Solomon Paine took much pains to prove, that it was a bad temper and conduct in the Baptiſts that cauſed the breach between him and them. But his brother, Eliſha Paine, a man of much more knowledge and experience, gave it as his mind, that the difficulty ſprang from the nature of oppoſite principles. For ſprinkling of infants, upon the faith of their parents, and burying of believers upon the profeſſion of their own faith, are oppoſite principles. And Mr. Eliſha Paine ſaid, "Dear brother, if you can reconcile the above principles, in the eſſential parts thereof, you will remove all the grounds of bars and diſputes: but if there be an eſſential differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the above articles, and conſequently in the practice on them, then there is an Achan in the camp; and no marvel that Iſrael hath, in all refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, been troubled therewith." Our ſecond vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ume, p. 212. Infant baptiſm is built upon the cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enant of circumciſion, which made a great difference between Jews by nature, and all other men; but in the Chriſtian church the apoſtle Peter could not countenance that diſtinction without <hi>diſſimulation.</hi> Gal. ii. 11—16. And for ſtealing of holy things, and diſſembling about them, Achan was deſtroyed in the valley of Achor. Joſhua vii. 11—26. And God ſays of his church, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderneſs, and ſpeak comfortably unto her; and I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope, and ſhe ſhall ſing there as in the days of her youth, and as in the
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:030011_0258_0FE3C1C24A590470"/>day when ſhe came out of the land of Egypt. And I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will ſay to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they ſhall ſay, Thou art my God. Hoſea ii. 14, 15, 23. This he ſays to his church under the goſpel. 1 Peter ii. 10. Rom. ix. 25. The holy ſcriptures are our rule, and not the beſt of men upon earth; yet love to men as Chriſtians was then ſet up by many as the rule of communion, inſtead of the written word; and their inward feelings were alſo made a rule of diſcipline, until ſome were cenſured for not concurring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Upon this they renounced mixed commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and gathered a ſecond Baptiſt church in Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington, and Mr. Simeon Brown was ordained their paſtor in March, 1765. And a pariſh miniſter in Stonington ſaid two years after, "Not leſs than two thirds of the congregation, formerly under my care, have withdrawn from my miniſtry, and formed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Baptiſt and ſeparate churches."<note n="*" place="bottom">Preface to Fiſh's Nine Sermons, p. 3.</note> And in January, 1769, Mr. Eleazar Brown was ordained in the firſt Baptiſt church in that town, which is four miles north of the other. He was born in Stoning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in June, 1728, and was a faithful and ſucceſsful miniſter, until he died in peace, July 11, 1795. Such a bleſſing was granted there in 1792, as cauſed the addition of fifty-ſix members to this church; and in 1793 Mr. Peleg Randal was ordained a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league paſtor in this church, in which he yet contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. And on October 22, 1794, they ordained Mr. Abel Brown as an evangeliſt, to go up and labour in the State of New-York. Elder Wait Palmer is yet living, but has not preached much for many years. Elder Simeon Brown was born in Stoning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, January 31, 1723, and his uſefulneſs is ſtill granted, and in the revival of 1792 ſeventy-ſix mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were added to his church. The third Baptiſt
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:030011_0259_0FE3C1513845B748"/>church in Stonington was conſtituted down at the harbour, April 22, 1775, and Mr. Valentine Wight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Rathbun was ordained their paſtor in May, 1787. He was born May 13, 1761. Mr. John Rathbun, his father, was ordained there as an evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, March 15, 1781, and is ſettled in Aſhford. A fourth church was formed in Stonington, and Mr. Samuel Northup, from Narraganſet, was ordained their paſtor in 1793, in connexion with the Groton Conference.</p>
               <p n="5">V. A ſeparate church was formed at Lyme, and Mr. Ebenezer Mack was ordained their paſtor, Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary 12, 1749. He and many of the church became Baptiſts afterwards, and he continued with them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he was diſmiſſed, in September, 1768, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to Marlow in New-Hampſhire. And Mr. Jaſon Lee was ordained the paſtor of this church, and hath had great ſucceſs therein, being connected with the Groton Conference. There had been a Baptiſt church in the eaſt part of Lyme before this, but they were broken and diſſolved. There was alſo a Baptiſt church formed in the north part of that town, and Mr. Chriſtopher Minor was their miniſter for ſome years, who is now at Enfield.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. A Baptiſt church was formed in Colcheſter in 1743, and Mr. Zebulun Waterman was their min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter for a number of years. After him Mr. Ichabod Allen miniſtered to them for a longer time, and who is ſtill living among them; but he hath been rather unſteady both in his principles and conduct, which ſerved to ſcatter the flock. But in May, 1784, a new gathering and union took place among them, and Mr. Abel Palmer became their paſtor, under whoſe miniſtry they have enjoyed many bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Their houſe for worſhip is near the borders of Montville. Another Baptiſt church had been formed in Colcheſter in 1783, near the borders of Lebanon, and Mr. Chriſtopher Palmer, father to
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:030011_0260_0FE3C1C5F03961F8"/>Abel, was ordained their paſtor. They came from Stonington. Many bleſſings have been granted upon theſe churches, and upon people who have ſprung from them, many of whom have ſettled in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, upon the head branches of the Mohawk and Suſquehanna rivers, in the State of New-York, where a new Aſſociation was formed in 1795, of thirteen churches, and more than five hundred mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which churches had been all formed in five years, as Mr. Abel Palmer ſays, who was at ſaid Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation. Thoſe people went mainly from New-England, and a large part of them out of the Ston<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington Aſſociation. There has been a mixed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion church in Norwich, in that part which is now Bozrah, for ſeveral years, and Mr. Peter Rogers was their miniſter, who is now at Hampton, but I know not how their ſtate now is. The mixed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion church of Preſton, have many of their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in Canterbury, and meetings are often held in both places.</p>

               <p n="7">VII. As the great reformation in our land was oppoſed by the ruling party in Thompſon, then a part of Killingly, a ſeparation took place there, and a Baptiſt church was formed in 1750, and Mr. Whitman Jacobs was ordained their paſtor. They held the laying on of hands upon every member as a term of communion, and an Aſſociation was formed upon thoſe principles, which increaſed to about eight churches in 1763; but in two years after the moſt of them gave up that bar of communion, of whom Mr. Jacobs was one, and a council was called at Thompſon in February, 1767, who could not unite the church; and as a number of them removed ſoon after to Royalſton, their miniſter removed there alſo in 1769. The brethren in Thompſon, after many labours, covenanted together anew in Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:030011_0261_0FE3C1566AF96378"/>and Mr. John Martin was ordained their paſtor, November 3, 1773. He went from Rehoboth, and is ſtill uſeful among them.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Mr. Thomas Denniſon was baptized by elder Wightman, of Groton, in the ſummer of 1743, and he gathered a ſmall church at Aſhford, where he was ordained in November following. Elder Moulton aſſiſted in his ordination, who derived his ſucceſſion from Mr. John Callender, and he from his uncle Eliſha Callender, in whoſe ordination three Congregational miniſters of Boſton aſſiſted. And this line of ſucceſſion is much valued by ſome, while all who conſiſtently hold the Congregational princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, adopted by the fathers of the Maſſachuſetts, hold that the power of ordination is in each church. This church in Aſhford broke up in a year or two, and Mr. Denniſon turned back to infant baptiſm, and he aſſiſted in the ordinations of the firſt ſeparate miniſters in Mansfield, Canterbury, Plainfield and Norwich; and was inſtalled himſelf as paſtor of a church in that part of Norwich which is now Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, all in the year 1746. But in a few years he left that people, and preached occaſionally in various parts of the country, without being ſettled over any other flock, until he died in Brooklyn, near Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, October, 24, 1787. A new Baptiſt church was formed in Aſhford in 1774, and Mr. Uſtick preached to them for a year or two, and then went to Grafton, and Mr. Ebenezer Lamſon was ordained their paſtor June 10, 1778. But he removed to Sutton in April, 1783, as was before obſerved; and after ſeveral years, they obtained Mr. Dyer Stark for their miniſter, who hath had conſiderable ſucceſs among them. The ſecond Baptiſt church in Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford was formed in the glorious year 1780. Mr. John Rathbun had removed from Stonington, into the north part of Aſhford before; and after this church was formed, he was ordained at Stonington,
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:030011_0262_0FE3C1CB84359360"/>March 15, 1781, and has been the paſtor of this church ever ſince. He was born June 26, 1729. In a revival of religion in the eaſt part of Aſhford, a third church was formed, and Mr. Daniel Bolton was ordained therein, June 27, 1792. He went from Bridgwater. Part of this church live in Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fret. About three years after, Mr. Bolton gathered another church near the adjoining corners of Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Union and Woodſtock, and ſettled as their miniſter.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The firſt Baptiſt church in Woodſtock was gathered in the following manner. Biel Ledoyt was a chief leader in mirth and vanity among young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there, before he heard a Baptiſt miniſter preach a ſermon in the town, in December, 1763, which was a means of fixing conviction of ſin in his conſcience, and in the March following his ſoul was brought into goſpel liberty; but as ſoon as his change was heard of abroad, four of his old companions came one evening, to try if they could not draw him back to his former ways again. He readily retired with them to a place where they could be by themſelves, and he laid open to them the way of ſin and death, and the way of life and peace, in ſuch a manner that two of them went home with a deep ſenſe of ſin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their minds, which terminated happily, and relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious meetings were frequent among young people, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til a large number were hopefully converted. For ſome time after this work began, they attended the pariſh meetings for worſhip, as they had done before; but ſuch oppoſition was raiſed againſt the work by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational party, as convinced thoſe young believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that they could not be edified among them; and upon ſearching the ſcriptures, they were convinced that believers' baptiſm was the way that Chriſt had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, and many obeyed him therein, and a Baptiſt church was formed in Woodſtock in 1766, and Mr. Ledoyt was ordained their paſtor, May 26, 1768, and
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:030011_0263_0FE3C15A07D33838"/>they had forty-eight members in 1773. And though it was a dark time with them through moſt of the war, yet on September 8, 1780, they ſaid in a letter to the Warren Aſſociation, "After a long day of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion and heavy trials, our God hath returned to us. By means of the uncommon darkneſs in May laſt, the Lord was pleaſed to awaken ſome ſouls among us, and from that time the work of God hath been going on gloriouſly in the weſt part of this town, where a goodly number are hopefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and peace and love abound in the church, and we have had twenty-eight added to us, and there is a proſpect of the ſpreading of the good work in other parts of this town and towns round us. Yet we are much affected with the long confinement of our brethren in Worceſter gaol,<note n="*" place="bottom">Three men of Harvard Society, before ſpoken of.</note> and cannot but remember them in bounds as being bound with them; nor can we expect to fare better ourſelves very long; notwithſtanding our endeavouring to anſwer the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt law of the ruling party, by giving certificates to the members of our ſociety, which have been carried to the pariſh clerk; yet a conſiderable number of them are rated to the ſtanding miniſtry, and ſoon expect to be diſtreſſed on that account.<note n="†" place="bottom">Several of them were ſtrained upon for ſuch taxes.</note> Our oppreſſors are deaf to all reaſoning upon the ſubject, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to proſecute their deſign, let the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be what it may. Theſe things, brethren, are peculiarly mortifying to us, eſpecially when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that we have freely fought and bled by their ſides in defence of liberty. It appears to us, that if ever there was a time, ſince tyranny had exiſtence in America, that we were called upon to exert our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to obtain what is our own, it is now. Should we let ſlip this golden ſeaſon, we fear our chains will be ſo faſt rivetted that we ſhall not be able to ſhake them off. We feel but little heart to hold the ſword
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:030011_0264_0FE3C1D04307B608"/>againſt a Britiſh invader in defence of liberty, while our countrymen are endeavouring to deprive us of liberty of conſcience. Oh, brethren! if we muſt be deprived of this, who would deſire to live and poſſeſs the reſt!" Their church increaſed the next year to 140 members. But in 1787 a member of a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational church obtained a meeting of this Baptiſt church, to hear a complaint which he had againſt one of their members, without taking the ſteps pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by our Lord in Matthew xviii; and it divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and raiſed ſuch a fire of contention in this church, as cauſed the diſmiſſion of their paſtor, at his requeſt, in March, 1790, and he went into New-Hampſhire, where he is ſtill uſeful. Another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival was granted in this church in 1792, and Mr. Samuel Webſter was ordained there the 28th of June, who is now at Monſon. A ſecond Baptiſt church was then formed in Woodſtock, and Mr. Amos Wells was ordained their paſtor, Auguſt 9, 1792, and the Stonington Aſſociation met there in October, 1795, when it was a good time with them.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Mr. Ledoyt was called to preach in the ſouth part of Pomfret, and a happy number were hopefully converted there, where were alſo ſeveral old believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and they embraced the Baptiſt principles, and formed a church there, January 18, and Mr. Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iam Grow was ordained their paſtor, June 19, 1776, and they proſpered under his miniſtry for ſeveral years. But in June, 1783, he confeſſed that he had fallen into the ſin of adultery, and reſigned his office, and afterwards removed into Vermont. Though this was very ſhocking, yet the church perſevered in their profeſſion, and obtained occaſional ſupplies from time to time, until they called and ſettled Mr. Peter Rogers as their paſtor in 1794, who had before been a miniſter in Bozrah. The place where this church meets, with a part of Windham, were lately incorporated into a town by the name of Hampton.
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:030011_0265_0FE3C15F44CAE5F0"/>A Baptiſt church was formed in Killingly, May 22, 1776, and Mr. George Robinſon was ordained their paſtor the 13th of November following, and they increaſed to 61 members in five years. But there aroſe ſuch difficulties in the church, about the time of the cloſe of the war, that they called a council, and then diſmiſſed and recommended their miniſter, and he removed to Bridgwater in June, 1784, where he is ſtill uſeful. They have paſſed through many changes in Killingly ſince, without obtaining ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a ſettlement as were to be wiſhed.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. The ſeparation in Plainfield prevailed ſo far, that the general ſcheme of taxing all to Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional miniſters was given up, and a miniſter was ſettled in their town meeting-houſe in 1784, who is ſupported by ſubſcription and a public fund, and the ſeparate meeting was diſſolved. But in the ſummer of 1792, a remarkable awakening took place in the eaſt part of the town, and in Stirling, under the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry of Mr. Nathanael Cole; and a Baptiſt church was formed there, October 16, 1792, and he was inſtalled their paſtor the 5th of December after, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been ordained at Swanſea before; and in two years this church increaſed to 87 members. I have not obtained any diſtinct account of the preſent Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt church in Mansfield, only what Mr. Aſplund has given in his Regiſter.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="12">XII. The firſt Baptiſt church in the country of Hartford was firſt conſtituted in Wallingford. A number of people in that town became Baptiſts about 1731, and joined to the Baptiſt church in New-Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but uſually met for worſhip at Wallingford, until they obtained a diſmiſſion, formed a church there, and ordained Mr. John Merriman as their paſtor, in 1739. He was born in Wallingford, October 15, 1695; and as he was a hearty friend
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:030011_0266_0FE3C1D5212083B8"/>to the great work which came on in our land two years after he was ordained, he obtained Dr. Bella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and then Mr. Robbins, to preach in his ſociety, as they were clear preachers of the goſpel. But Mr. Robbins was moſt cruelly perſecuted by his brethren in the miniſtry, for preaching among the Baptiſts againſt their advice, as we have before ſhewn. Our ſecond volume, p. 136, 178. In the year 1750, the body of this church removed to the ſouth part of Farmington, where they ſtill remain. Mr. Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man continued their faithful paſtor as long as he was able to labour with them, and he died there in 1784. Afterwards they obtained various helps, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they came into the ſtate that is before deſcribed, from the minutes of the Danbury Aſſociation for 1795. Briſtol is not far from them, where is the church who keep the ſeventh day as the Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. Suffield, on the weſt ſide of Connecticut-river, had a powerful work among them in 1735, and a greater work ſix years after; and when the ſeparations came on, two ſeparate churches were formed in the town, and each had an ordained min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter. Mr. Iſrael Holly was one of them, who pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſeveral things in favour of their ſeparate churches, and then againſt the Baptiſts, after which he turned back, and became a pariſh miniſter. But Mr. John Haſtings, ſon to their other ſeparate min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter, was called out to preach the goſpel, and embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed believers' baptiſm; and juſt as the war was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in our land, ſuch a bleſſing was granted upon his labours, that a Baptiſt church was formed, and he was ordained their paſtor in 1775, and it increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to above 200 members in about a year. And he has been very uſeful, at home and abroad, ever ſince.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Enfield, on the eaſt ſide of the river againſt Suffield, had alſo two ſeparate churches, in one of which the Baptiſt principles were early adopted.
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:030011_0267_0FE3C163E87AABC0"/>Mr. Joſeph Meacham was their miniſter, and they joined to the Warren Aſſociation in 1769, when they had 30 members; but they afterwards declined from their profeſſion, and their miniſter fell in with the Shakers, and is ſince dead. The church was broken and ſcattered for a number of years; but we hear of a late gathering among them, and that they have obtained Mr. Chriſtopher Minor as their paſtor. He came from Lyme, and was miniſter to the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt church in Eaſt-Hartford for a number of years, who now have Mr. Stephen Shepard as their min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter. A Baptiſt church was formed in the city of Hartford in 1789, which increaſed to fifty-three members in two years, and greater bleſſings are hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. A ſeparate meeting was ſet up at Windſor, as early as 1747, and Daniel Marſhall went from thence in 1754, and laboured with great ſucceſs in the ſouthern States, and began the firſt Baptiſt church in Georgia in 1772. His brother, Eliakim Marſhall, was frequently a repreſentative for Windſor in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut legiſlature, before his couſin Abraham Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall came there from Georgia, and baptized him, and he was paſtor of a Baptiſt church there for four or five years, before he died there in June, 1791. But I know not how things have been in that church ſince. There has been a Baptiſt meeting in Weth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ersfield for many years, but perhaps not a church formed. The other Baptiſt churches in this county appear in the foregoing liſt.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="15">XV. After the Baptiſt church of Wallingford was removed from thence, their pariſh miniſter died, and a diviſion took place in the town, and the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the county aſſiſted in forming another church, and ordaining a ſecond miniſter, becauſe the majority had got a miniſter from Cambridge, whom they judged to be an Arminian. And as the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:030011_0268_0FE3C1D7DD89E7A8"/>of Yale college were very zealous againſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any into it but ſtrict Calviniſts, long contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies were carried on in the government about it. And in February, 1783, the controverſy was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the public papers at Hartford, and it was purſued therein until June. And to ſhew how inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious the rulers of the college had been to its true intereſts, it was ſaid, "Mr. Collins, late of Newport, offered eight volumes to the library of Yale college. Being a Baptiſt, four of the volumes were in defence of this ſyſtem. The offer of the books was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with an intimation, that if the eight volumes were received with a good grace, the whole library of the ſaid Mr. Collins (who was a bachelor) conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſeven or eight hundred volumes, would prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be given to the college. But the condition of giving the eight volumes was not complied with. This condition was, that they ſhould be placed in the library ſo that the ſtudents might ſee them, and if they choſe, read them." The writer who gave this information ſtyled himſelf Parnaſſus, to whom an anſwer was given by one who ſays, "Parnaſſus finds fault that they did not accept of the Anabaptiſt books upon a ſhameful condition, which, if they had done it, would have been a ground of objection, that they had iutroduced erroneous books, and have given up the government of the college." Thus it appears, that the corporation of the college were afraid to have any of their ſcholars read any books againſt infant baptiſm, leſt it ſhould weaken their plan of orthodoxy; while men who wanted to pull down Calviniſm, made uſe of this action as a means to do it, though they were far from favouring the Baptiſts. A change in the government of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege took place ſoon after, and the miniſter who had cauſed a ſeparation at Wallingford removed and ſettled in New-Haven, and two Baptiſt churches have ſince been formed at Wallingford. And through all
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:030011_0269_0FE3C168F2FE3EB8"/>the country the new Baptiſt churches have evidently ſprung from the ſpiritual work therein, while the towns where that work was rejected remain in their old formality.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="16">XVI. Mr. John Sherwood was born in 1706, converted in 1741, and he with others ſeparated from the pariſh worſhip in Stratfield, becauſe a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter was ſettled there who did not appear to them to be a goſpel preacher. In October, 1751, elder Joſhua Morſe baptized him and a number more, and a Baptiſt church was then formed there, and on De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 15, 1757, Mr. Sherwood was ordained their paſtor, by the aſſiſtance of elder Morſe and elder Timothy Wightman. He miniſtered to that church about ten years, and then his health failed, and Mr. Benjamin Coles was called from Long-Iſland to preach to them, in the ſpring of 1768, and he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured with them until the fall of 1774, when he was called into New-Jerſey. Mr. Sherwood was then weak in body, but ſtedfaſt and comfortable in his mind; and how long he lived afterwards I know not. But the church called Mr. Seth Higby from Middletown, and he was ordained their paſtor, and he continued ſo until 1793, and then he removed to a church in the State of New-York, and elder Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Royce from New-Hampſhire became their paſtor.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. The Baptiſt church in Stamford was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the following manner. Dr. Joſeph Bellamy publiſhed a piece in 1768, to prove that a credible profeſſion of ſaving grace was neceſſary, in every perſon who came to the Lord's ſupper, or who was active in baptiſm. But Dr. Moſes Mather, of Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, publiſhed a diſcourſe in April, 1769, wherein he owned that the covenant of circumciſion with Abraham was not the covenant of grace, in the ſtrict
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:030011_0270_0FE3C1DDA0530E10"/>of the word, but held it to be a covenant wherein parents and their children were conſtituted members of the viſible church of God, and that they ought to come to the Lord's ſupper as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting ordinance, if they were not converted before. Mr. Ebenezer Farris, of Stamford, had newly joined to the firſt church in that town; but theſe things gave ſuch a turn to his mind as cauſed him to ſearch the ſcriptures afreſh, whereby he was fully convinced that baptiſm and the holy ſupper were inſtituted only for profeſſing believers; and he was baptized by Mr. John Gano, of New-York, in April, 1770, as others were afterwards, until they obtained a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diſmiſſion, and alſo aſſiſtance from the church in New-York, and formed a Baptiſt church at Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, November 6, 1773, of twenty-one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. By a like diſmiſſion and aſſiſtance, a Baptiſt church was formed three days before on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Greenwich, called Kingſtreet; and Mr. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plund miſtakes in dating the beginning of that church in 1747. Mr. Farris was afterwards ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the paſtor of the church in Stamford, and alſo publiſhed a defence of believers' baptiſm. Mr. Eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mezer White, of Danbury, was a hearty friend to the revival of religion in our land; and when he read Sandiman's letters, he manifeſted an approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ideas concerning the finiſhed atonement of Chriſt, and ſo did a majority of his church; but a minor part went and entered a complaint againſt Mr. White to their Aſſociation, upon which he and a large majority of his church, on June 28, 1763, renounced the power that was claimed over the churches on the Saybrook platform. But the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters of that county were ſo unwilling to part with that power, that they met at Danbury, againſt the conſent of Mr. White and the majority of his church, and rejected them as men who had ſeparated from the eccleſiaſtical conſtitution of their government.
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:030011_0271_0FE3C16BEB0F5C78"/>This was on March 27, 1764. Sandiman came into our country the next October, and gathered church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in ſeveral places; but when he came to Danbury, Mr. White could not agree with him in many things, though a number joined with him there, and alſo at New-Haven, and Mr. Sandiman died at Danbury, April 2, 1771, aged 53. But in the enſuing war, moſt of his followers held with Britain, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them went off to Nova-Scotia, and their ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties are generally diſſolved. In 1770 Mr. David Judſon, miniſter at Newtown, renounced the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook platform, and publiſhed his mind againſt it, while the majority of the miniſters exerted all their influence againſt him; and two Baptiſt churches have been ſince gathered in Danbury, and one in Newtown. Ridgfield is alſo in this county.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. There was more of a reformation in this county, in and after 1741, than in many parts of the country. Dr. Bellamy was a very active inſtrument of that reformation, and his writings afterwards up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the nature of religion, and alſo upon qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions neceſſary for communion in the Chriſtian church, ſcattered much light in our land; and ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral other miniſters in the county of Litchfield have been clear preachers of the goſpel, and ſucceſsful in their labours, who now reſt therefrom, and others have been introduced in their ſtead, who are men of another ſpirit. And ſince the late war, nine Baptiſt churches have been formed in this county, and ſeven of them in ſix years. But as new towns have been conſtituted, and old names have been altered, while ſome meetings have alſo been removed, a little explanation is neceſſary. The Baptiſt church in Litchfield was the firſt in Watertown, and Roxbury was once called South-Britain, while the names of the other ſeven remain as they were. Some of their
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:030011_0272_0FE3C1E2EE554078"/>miniſters have removed from place to place. Elder Eliſha Ranſom was at Watertown in 1790, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and ſince has been at Woodſtock, in Vermont. Elder Stephen Shepard was at Torrington in 1790, who is now at Eaſt-Hartford. Elder Iſaac Roots was at Warren in 1790, and at the ſecond in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertown in 1793, but at no church in that Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in 1795. Elder Nathaniel Norton was at Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury in 1790, and at Wallingford in 1791, but out of that Aſſociation ſince. In new churches, and in changes of ſentiments, men are often more unſteady than when they obtain more clear eſtabliſhment. Though travelling miniſters, if they are wiſe and faithful, have done much good in every age; while deceitful teachers, whether ſupported by law, or travelling through the world, have done infinite evils to mankind.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="19">XIX. There were ſome Baptiſts in Saybrook as early as 1729, who then complied with the certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate law, to exempt them from taxes to eſtabliſhed miniſters, as Dr. Stiles informed me. In January, 1744, elder Timothy Peckom viſited them, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized ſome perſons on a Lord's day, when the water of a brook was raiſed for the purpoſe. For theſe things he and a number more were impriſoned at New-London, one of whom was a woman with a child at her breaſt. Mr. Elnathan Wilcox was a miniſter in the church there for a number of years before 1770, but in 1780 he was ſettled at Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge. Elder Leſter, from New-London, was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled at Saybrook afterwards, and remains there. But in 1788 a number drew off and formed another church, and ordained Mr. William Hill as their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and they are connected with the Groton Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. The other Baptiſt churches in this county belong to the Stonington Aſſociation, and their ſtate
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:030011_0273_0FE3C1717B6FD5E8"/>has been given from their minutes. Abraham Doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>little, of Middletown, went to the ſeparate meeting there for ſome years, to hear Mr. Ebenezer Froth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham preach, who was firſt ordained at Wethers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, October 28, 1747, but removed his meeting to Middletown a few years after. But as Mr. Doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>little embraced the Baptiſt ſentiments, Frothingham openly and frequently prayed and preached againſt them, and then publiſhed a bitter pamphlet upon the ſubject; therefore Doolittle and his friends with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew and ſet up a meeting by themſelves in 1769, and Mr. Seth Higby, who married his daughter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to preach there, who went afterwards to Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, as was before related. Doolittle is a member of a Baptiſt church in Wallingford. But about the year 1781, Mr. Frothingham was rejected by his church, and they ordained Mr. Stephen Parſons in his ſtead, who was well eſteemed in his place, until he was conſtrained to give up infant baptiſm, and was baptized, with about fifteen of his church, in the cloſe of the ſummer of 1795; ſo that a Baptiſt church is like to be ſettled there ſoon.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="20">XX. A Baptiſt church was formed in Tolland, and Mr. Shubael Stearns was ordained therein March 20, 1751, by the aſſiſtance of the elders Wait Palmer and Joſhua Morſe. But in July, 1754, Stearns baptized Mr. Noah Alden, of Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and he ſet off the next month, with oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to go into our ſouthern governments. And Stearns wrote to Alden, from Hampſhire county, in Virginia, June 13, 1755, and informed him that ſome of their company were then ſettled in North-Carolina, who ſaid to him in a letter, "That there was no eſtabliſhed meeting within an hundred miles of them, and that the people were ſo eager to hear, that they often came forty miles each way, when they
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:030011_0274_0FE3C1E7D0EA2B70"/>could have an opportunity to hear a ſermon." He went himſelf, and gathered a Baptiſt church on San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-Creek, Orange county, North-Carolina. When I was in Virginia in 1789, I ſaw a record of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their Aſſociations, and was informed that Daniel Marſhall baptized Samuel Harris, who had been a member of their legiſlature, and a judge of court in Virginia. Their firſt Aſſociation met in January, 1760, and they met again in July that year, when the liſt of their churches ſtood thus, including both meetings. Sandy-Creek, elder Shubael Stearns; Deep-river, Nathaniel Powel, a brother; Abbot's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creek, elder Daniel Marſhall; Little-river, Joſeph Breed, a brother; Neus-river, Ezekiel Hunter; Black-river, John Newton; Dan-river, Pittſylvania county, elder Samuel Harris; Lunenburg county, William Murphey. The two laſt are in Virginia, the reſt are in North-Carolina. Elder Stearns wrote again to elder Alden, from Sandy-Creek, October 16, 1765, and ſaid, "The Lord carries on his work glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in ſundry places in this province, and in Virgin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ia, and South-Carolina." And he laboured in thoſe parts as long as he lived; but Marſhall went and gathered the firſt Baptiſt church in Georgia, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of his ſon, Abraham Marſhall, is paſtor. And it appears by the minutes of their Aſſociation in 1792, that they had fifty-ſix churches, and 3796 members in the State of Georgia. How wonderful are theſe events! They who were left of the church in Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, joined with others in Stafford, and ordained Mr. Alden as their paſtor, June 5, 1755, and he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured with them ten years, and then ſuch diſorders had crept into the church, that he was diſmiſſed by the advice of a council, as was before obſerved. They have paſſed through various changes ſince, and their preſent ſtate is given above. A ſeparate church was formed in Somers about 1751, and Mr. Joſeph Marſhall was ordained their paſtor, who ſoon became
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:030011_0275_0FE3C0374D955350"/>a Baptiſt, and then turned back to infant baptiſm, and he was inſtalled at Canterbury, ſucceſſor to Mr. Paine; but after a few years he was diſmiſſed, and has preached about the country ever ſince, without taking the charge of any other flock. But we are informed that a Baptiſt church was conſtituted in Somers in 1790, and that Mr. Seth Parſons is ſince ordained their paſtor. Mr. Lillebridge, the paſtor of the Baptiſt church in Willington, came from the State of Rhode-Iſland, and is eſteemed in his place. But I have no further accounts of that church, nor of the other Baptiſts in the county of Tolland, that appear to be ſerviceable to the public, than what are already given.</p>

               <p n="1">1. ALL the lands between Merrimack and Piſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aqua rivers, and ſixty miles into the country, were granted to captain John Maſon, in 1629, under the name of New-Hampſhire. But the Maſſachuſetts charter extended three miles north of Merrimack-river, and Maſon, with his heirs or aſſigns, claimed all the reſt of thoſe lands; and this was the cauſe why New-Hampſhire was not included in the ſecond charter to the Maſſachuſetts, in 1691, as Gorges' grant was, which this government had purchaſed of his heirs. None of the lands within this grant, nor from thence to Connecticut-river, were ever the free property of the people, ſo as to be granted by their repreſentatives, before the late American war; and quit-rents were reſerved upon the lands which were granted by their governors, until the American rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution put an end to them. Dr. Belknap has given a clear view of theſe things, in his elegant Hiſtory of New-Hampſhire. And as the governors and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors of that government were appointed by the crown, the Congregational denomination were never exalted ſo high above all others there, as they have
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:030011_0277_0FE3C1761883A280"/>been in Maſſachuſetts and Connecticut; and ſince the revolution, if the majority of any town elect a Baptiſt teacher for their miniſter, he may have the privilege of the lands therein which were granted for the miniſtry, and alſo may be ſupported by tax if he will. And the Baptiſts increaſed ſo much in the year 1780, that a miniſter of Rowley publiſhed a letter againſt them, in a Boſton paper of February 8, 1781, in which he ſaid, "Alas, the conſequence of the prevalence of this ſect! They cauſe diviſions every where. In the State of New-Hampſhire, where there are many new towns, infant ſettlements, if this ſect gets footing among them, they hinder, and are like to hinder, their ſettling and ſupporting learned, pious and orthodox miniſters; and ſo the poor inhabitants of thoſe towns muſt live, who knows how long? without the miniſtry of the goſpel, and goſpel ordinances." As if the goſpel, and goſpel ordinances, were confined to the Congregational party. Yea, he ſaid to the Baptiſts, "You have had two grand conventions (the ſecond of them upon adjournment) within a few months paſt, at a town in the State of New-Hampſhire, to ſerve and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote this cauſe; at which conventions, theſe illiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and unſkilful preachers, and delegates from your little churches around, were members. And one thing I heard of as a part of your buſineſs at ſaid convention, was to conſult what meaſures you ſhould take to make void in part our new conſtitution of government; that part of it which reſpects the public worſhip of God." But all the pretence he could have for this repreſentation, was becauſe the Warren Aſſociation met in September, 1780, at Royalſtone, which adjoins to New-Hampſhire, and after it was over, the church there agreed to call a council the next month, for advice upon ſome difficulties among themſelves, and not upon the concerns of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. Though as three men of the Harvard
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:030011_0278_0FE3C1EB7B175990"/>ſociety had been impriſoned at Worceſter, and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were daily expoſed to the ſame ſufferings, for taxes to Congregational miniſters, the Warren Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation drew up a teſtimony againſt ſuch oppreſſion, in their ſaid meeting, and printed many copies of it, which were ſent into all parts of the government, and was ſigned by many hundreds of men, of various denominations. And is it a crime for any men who are oppreſſed, to expoſe the iniquity of their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and openly to teſtify againſt the ſame?</p>
               <p n="2">II. The firſt Baptiſt church that was formed in New-Hampſhire, was at Newtown, northward of Haverhill, in 1755. In June that year Mr. Walter Powers was ordained their paſtor, and they increaſed under his miniſtry for ſome years; but then differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſentiments about church diſcipline, with unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py tempers in controverſies, cauſed ſuch difficulties, that a council of four churches was called, May 18, 1761, and held four days, without being able to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oncile paſtor and people. And he was afterwards diſmiſſed and removed away, and is ſince dead; but his ſon is a uſeful miniſter at Gilmantown. This church at Newtown laboured through many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, until a Baptiſt church was formed in Haverhill, in 1765, and then many of the members joined there, and this church was diſſolved. But the main body of the inhabitants of Newtown, have lately come ſo much into the Baptiſt ſentiments, that they prevailed with Mr. John Peak, who had been preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Cambridge and Woburn, to remove there in the fall of 1795, and a Baptiſt church was formed here in February, 1796. He was born at Walpole, in this State, September 26, 1761, was ordained at Windſor, in Vermont, and hath been a ſucceſsful preacher in various parts of the country.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The revival of religion in 1764, ſpread into ſeveral towns in New-Hampſhire, and the doctrine of believers' baptiſm followed it, until Mr. Smith, of
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:030011_0279_0FE3C17AFB09B948"/>Haverhill, was ſent for, and he baptized thirty-eight perſons in a week, in June, 1770. Fourteen of them were the Congregational miniſter and majority of his church in Deerfield, who were ſettled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Baptiſt church the ſame month. Mr. Eliphalet Smith was their paſtor, who is now at Fayette, in the county of Lincoln, before ſpoken of. A Baptiſt church was formed at Stratham, July 18, 1770, of fourteen members, and another at Brentwood of thirteen members, May 2, 1771, and one of ſixteen members was conſtituted at Nottingham the next day; and theſe churches unitedly called Mr. Samuel Shepard to receive ordination, and he was ordained at Stratham, September 25, 1771, when Dr. Still<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man preached the ſermon, Mr. Smith, of Haverhill, gave the charge, and Dr. Manning, of Providence, the right hand of fellowſhip. Mr. Shepard was born at Saliſbury, near Newbury, in 1739, was early changed by grace, and was a uſeful phyſician, before he was baptized in June, and began to preach in July, 1770. Theſe three churches have united as one, and others have joined with them from other places, ſo that they had one hundred and ſixty-one members in 1785; and though they did not increaſe for five years after, yet ſuch a bleſſing was then grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they had three hundred and ninety-ſeven members in 1792, and five hundred and twenty-ſix in 1793. And one hundred and twenty-one were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed the next year, though they have a large num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber now. Mr. Joſhua Smith was of this church, who laboured much in various places, with conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable ſucceſs, until he died with a conſumption in February, 1795. Elder Samuel Currier was alſo of this church, who is now ordained at Wentworth. Elder Shepard has travelled and laboured much in our new towns, eſpecially in 1780. Our ſecond volume, p. 390. And he has ſince publiſhed ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral books in defence of our ſentiments.</p>

IV. A Baptiſt church was formed at Salem, in this county, in 1780, and Mr. Samuel Fletcher was ordained their paſtor, December 6, 1781. He was born in the couty of Middleſex, in Auguſt, 1747, born again in 1767, and began to preach in 1777. He was called to preach at Chelmsford in the ſpring of 1770, and preached there the main of the time for two years, and his labours were alſo very ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in ſeveral other places, which appeared to be the cauſe of his meeting with uncommon abuſe in one place. For being called to Pepperell, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with Dr. Parker, of Harvard, they met by the ſide of a river, for the conveniency of baptizing within an incloſed field; but while Mr. Fletcher was preaching, a large mob broke into the field, and interrupted him in his ſermon, while a dog was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and plunged in the river, in evident contempt of our mode of baptiſm. The chief officers of the town were leaders of the mob; therefore a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man invited theſe miniſters to go and hold their meeting at his houſe, near another river, and they did ſo, and Fletcher went through with his ſermon, after which two dogs more were dipped in that river, and one young man alſo dipped his compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, in a moſt ſcornful manner, and ſome officers of the town adviſed ſaid miniſters to depart immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately out of town for their own ſafety. But they privately agreed with their friends to diſperſe, and they met at another place of water, and baptized ſix perſons near night, though further abuſe was offered them afterwards. Our ſecond volume, p. 323. Elder Fletcher continued a faithful paſtor of this church, until he was taken away by death in March, 1795, when his corps was carried to the Congregational meeting-houſe in Salem, where a Baptiſt miniſter preached a funeral ſermon for him, and then ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Congregational miniſters were his pall-bearers, with others of his own denomination.</p>

V. The Baptiſt church in Northwood was alſo formed in 1780, and Mr. Edmund Pilſbury was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained their paſtor, who had been a member of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verhill church. They had forty-four members in 1785, but had no increaſe for five years after, and then ſuch a bleſſing was granted that ſeventy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were added in two years, and they appear to be in harmony. But after two churches were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in two parts of Canterbury in this county, in 1779 and 1780, ſome corrupt teachers drew away a number of them, and thoſe churches, as well as one in Chicheſter, are not among our aſſociated churches, if they are not entirely ſcattered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. For although pariſhes that are formed and ſupported by the civil magiſtrate, will continue as long as that power can uphold them, yet churches that are formed by the laws of Chriſt, are removed out of their places if they leave their firſt love, and refuſe to repent.

In 1789 they had thirty members, in 1792 they had forty-four, and in three years they increaſed to ſeventy-ſix. The church in Meredith was formed in 1780, when forty-three perſons were baptized in one day by elder Shepard. Mr. Nicholas Folſom was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained their paſtor in 1782, who went from Brent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and continues in that office. Their Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion began in 1789. The church in Sandburnton was alſo formed in 1780, and Mr. John Crocket was ordained their paſtor September 3, 1794. The church in Sandwich was formed in 1793, and Mr. Jacob Jewel is their paſtor. Madbury contains a part of Berwick church, and we have no late account of any other Baptiſt church in this county.</p>

VII. A Baptiſt church was formed at Weare, and they joined with the Warren Aſſociation in 1768, when Mr. Pelatiah Tingley was their meſſenger. In 1770 they had ſixteen members, but ſuch unhappy controverſies aroſe among them, that they ſent no more to the Aſſociation, and they were left out of it in 1774. But they were revived again in 1783, and Mr. Amos Wood, who graduated at Rhode-Iſland college in 1786, was ordained their paſtor, and has continued ſo ever ſince. The town of Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinton is not far from Weare, and ſuch a work took place there, under the preaching of Mr. Smith, of Haverhill, and others, that they had ſeventeen baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons among them in 1769, and they joined as a branch of Haverhill church, until they were diſmiſſed and formed a church in Hopkinton in May, 1771. But falſe teachers and corrupt principles prevailed ſo much among them afterwards, as to diſſolve their church. Though elder Seamans, in a letter to a friend in 1794, gave the following account of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival among them. "Soon after I came into this wilderneſs (ſaid he) I found that the Baptiſt intereſt was much ſmaller than I expected. In Hopkinton, there had been a Baptiſt church, but not one ſtone of that building was left upon another. I preached ſome there, and baptized three perſons; and after a conference or two with them, they came into church ſtate, adopted our articles of faith, and I adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the communion to them, which they had not had for a number of years. The reformation began there in the ſummer of 1792, and now there is a church there, with its two branches in Bow and Goffstown, of one hundred and thirteen members; a very reſpectable body of Chriſtians." This was their ſtate in 1794, and they have ſince obtained elder Eliſha Andrews to be their paſtor. There had been ſome Baptiſts in Temple for ſeventeen years,
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:030011_0283_0FE3C18521E5FE68"/>even from the beginning of that plantation, until they formed a church there, Augut 21, 1782, of twenty-two members. Another had been formed the April before in Perryſton, now Sutton, and Mr. Samuel Ambroſe was ordained their paſtor in Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember after. The church in Maſon, formed in 1786, obtained Mr. William Elliot for their miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but we are informed that he labours part of his time at Hollis, where a Baptiſt church was formed in 1791.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. We have more particular account of two other churches in this in this county. The firſt is at New-London, where elder Seamans removed from Attle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough in 1788. As he was the firſt miniſter of the town, they gave him the lands which were granted for the miniſtry therein, and alſo ſupported him by a tax. A Baptiſt church was formed there in 1788, and he ſettled as their paſtor, but they had very little increaſe for four years; and he had many fears that he took a wrong ſtep in removing from Attleborough, although he then thought he had good reaſons for it. Theſe fears were very diſtreſſing to his mind, until a bleſſing was granted upon his min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry in 1792, which appeared the moſt viſible in and after Auguſt in that year. In a letter to a friend, of Jannuary 29, 1793, he ſaid, "This town conſiſts of about fifty families, and I hope that between forty and fifty ſouls have been tranſlated out of darkneſs into God's marvellous light, in this town, beſides a number in Sutton and Fiſherfield, who congregate with us. Fifteen have been baptized, and joined to the church, and I expect that a number more will come forward in a ſhort time. Indeed I know not of one of them but what is likely to ſubmit to goſped order, nor one perſon in the town who ſtands in any conſiderable oppoſition. We have lectures or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences almoſt every day or evening in the week. Our very children meet together to converſe and
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:030011_0284_0FE3C053F22C3918"/>pray with each other; and I believe I may ſafely ſay, that our young people were never a quarter ſo much engaged in frolicking, as they now are in the great concerns of the ſoul and eternity. Some things in this work have exceeded any thing I ever ſaw before. Their convictions have uſually been very clear and powerful, ſo that induſtrious men and women have had neither inclination nor ſtrength to follow their buſineſs as uſual. And they freely acknowledge the juſtice and ſovereignty of God. They alſo have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires beyond what I have ever before known, for the univerſal out-pouring of the Holy Spirit." And in another letter, December 1, 1794, directed to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other friend, he ſaid, "The work began here in 1792; our church them conſiſted of eighteen mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and now we have one hundred and fifteen, all except three or four within five miles of our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe, Some of all ages from ſeventy down to eight years old have joined to the church. I think we have thirty-ſeven men with their wives in the church." The town of Saliſbury, upon the great road from Boſton to Dartmouth college, is not far from him; and a number of men in that town were of the Baptiſt ſentiments, and built a good meeting-houſe there, when there was hardly a baptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon among them. Elder Seamans was called to preach among them in 1792, and he ſays in ſaid let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, "A number wanted to have a Baptiſt church conſtitued, as they intended to have a Baptiſt min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter. But I told them that there muſt be ſomething done amongſt them which man could not do, before a Baptiſt church could be gathered there. And this work the Lord begun about the ſame time as at Hopkinton, and now there is a flouriſhing church there of one hundred and twenty-five members, with a fine preacher." Mr. Elias Smith, who came from Connecticut, and preached in many places, and was ordained as a travelling miniſter, is ſettled as their paſtor.</p>

               <p n="9">IX. A Baptiſt church was formed in Richmond, and Mr. Matturean Bollou was ordained their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, September 27, 1770, being the firſt miniſter of any denomination in the town. They joined to the Warren Aſſociation in 1771, when they informed the Aſſociation, that a number of the inhabitants were unwilling to allow their miniſter the privileges of the firſt miniſter of the town, and that neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towns would not regard the certificates which they gave to ſome of their ſociety who lived therein. Their church had then twenty-nine members, and they increaſed to ſeventy-nine in three years; and then they were in a low condition for ſix years after, until the revival in 1780 cauſe the addition of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four in three years more. In the mean time a diviſion took place among them, and another church was formed, in which Mr. Artemas Aldrich was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. And they were in broken circumſtances, until another revival began in 1790, which cauſed the addition of one hundred and ſix members in about two years, and their two minſters were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, and the two churches united, with Mr. Iſaac Kenny for their paſtor. In 1794 they were diſmiſſed to the Leyden Aſſociation.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Many of the inhabitants of Weſtmoreland went from the firſt Baptiſt ſociety in Middleborough, and they formed a Baptiſt church there in 1771, and Mr. Ebenezer Bayley was ordained their paſtor, November 30, 1773. But after ſome years a diviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion took place among them, and another church was formed, in which Mr. Nathaniel Wilbore preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, though he is not ordained. Another church was formed in Marlow in 1777, and Mr. Eleazar Beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with was ordained their paſtor, and ſo continues. He and many of his people went from Lyme, in Connecticut. Mr. Caleb Blood was ordained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:030011_0286_0FE3BB12D3C93368"/>in October, 1777, who is now at Shaftſbury. When this church joined to the Woodſtock Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in 1786, they had one hundred and eighteen members, and in 1790 they had one hundred and eighty-four. A Baptiſt church was formed at Croy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in 1778, and in 1790 they joined with Newport, and ſettled elder Bial Ledoyt as their paſtor, who went from Woodſtock in Connecticut. And a revival of religion began among them in June, 1793, by means of an alarming providence. For the eldeſt ſon of Mr. Seamans, a lovely youth, came to aſſiſt in raiſing the frame of a meeting-houſe at Newport, but he fell from the top of it, and died ſoon. The afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was exceeding great to his parents, and very alarming to others, which the Spirit of God made uſe of for their good. And on September 16, 1793, Mr. Ledoyt ſaid in a letter to a friend, "It hath been a long, dark, and cloudy night with me, and the people here; but glory to our God, the cloud is diſperſing faſt. His work is begun among us; Newport and Croyden are greatly bleſſed. There have been forty ſouls hopefully converted in a few weeks among us, I have baptized twenty-nine in four weeks. The work appears ſtill going on. I cannot be idle, it is out of my power to anſwer all the calls I have at this time; but I endeavour to do all I can. Being favoured with health, and the ſpirit of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I aſcend the mountains eaſy. There is a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of a glorious reformation in theſe parts. O may it ſpread far and wide! God hath remembered my family alſo for good; my three eldeſt daughters, I hope, are converted; the oldeſt ſeventeen years, and the youngeſt ten years old, are baptized. O bless the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together. I never more ſenſibly needed wiſdom than at preſent. You will not ceaſe to pray for me. O dear brother, be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:030011_0287_0FE3C18E8E6833B0"/>might." I muſt leave the reſt of the churches in this county, as they appear in the foregoing liſt.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="11">XI. The firſt Baptiſt church in this county, was formed at Lebanon, in June, 1771, and Mr. Jedidiah Hebbard was ordained therein in 1784. But ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them removed to other places, that in 1790 they concluded that the church was diſſolved. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Hebbard has ſince been paſtor of the church in Corniſh. A Baptiſt church was formed in Canaan in 1783, wherein elder Baldwin was ordained, and he miniſtered to them until he removed to Boſton in 1790. Many of the inhabitants of Grafton went from Rehoboth and Swanſea, and they formed a Baptiſt church there in 1785, and Mr. Oliver Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iams was ordained their paſtor, and continued ſo until he died in a joyful manner, Auguſt 15, 1790, aged 39. He went from the State of Rhode-Iſland, and probably was one of the poſterity of Mr. Roger Williams, the founder of that State. The church in Rumney was formed in 1780, and Mr. Cotton Hains was ordained their paſtor in Auguſt that year. The church in Holderneſs was formed the ſame year, and Mr. Jeremiah Ward is their paſtor. The reſt of the Baptiſt churches in this county appear in the foregoing liſt, of whom I have not received ſo full accounts as I expected. But I have ſome things of a more extenſive nature, concerning this part of the country, which may be beneficial to the public.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Dr. Eleazar Wheelock was ſettled in the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry, in the weſt part of Lebanon, in Connecticut, and was acquainted with experimental religion before Mr. Whitefield came into our country; and he was an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ſucceſsful labourer in the reformation that followed, until the work was much abated, and then he turned his attention to the inſtruction of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, in order to ſpread the goſpel among them;
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:030011_0288_0FE3C1FF97374C60"/>which led on to the forming Dartmouth college, which was eſtabliſhed in Hanover, in this county, to which he removed in the ſummer of 1770. Some revival of religion was granted in this wilderneſs ſoon after, and things looked encouraging, until war broke out in our land, which tried the hearts of all. And as a quantity of money for this college had been collected in England and Scotland, which was put into a fund in London, from whence the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt was to be drawn annually, ſome imagined that Dr. Wheelock was biaſſed in favour of Britain in the war, which occaſioned the following actions. He lived ſo remote from the ſeat of their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that proclamations for faſts and thankſgivings ſometimes failed of reaching him until the days ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed were paſt; and as Connecticut government had appointed November 16, 1775, for their annual thankſgiving, of which he had received an account, he and his people kept that day. But in the week following he received a proclamation from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his own government, which appointed another day a fortnight after the other; and he was willing that all who had not kept the former day ſhould keep the latter, while he could not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience keep two thankſgivings in that ſeaſon, only to obey the commandments of men. Yet becauſe he refuſed to do it, he was threatened to be proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by authority, therefore he preached a ſermon on ſaid day, from John xviii. 36, and publiſhed it to the world, under the title of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience; or, No King but Chriſt in his Church.</hi> He obſerved that rulers have only power to propoſe the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch days, and to protect all in their worſhip from being injured by others, while the conſent of the people to keep the day, is the only thing that can make it binding upon them to do it. And he ſays, "When civil power encroaches an inch upon Chriſt's prerogative, a ſanctified and enlightened
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:030011_0289_0FE3C1947096A110"/>conſcience can never be compelled to a compliance; and if they are of the truth, and hear Chriſt's voice, no inſtruments of cruelty will avail any thing in this attempt.—The leaſt yielding in this caſe is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and a direct and leading ſtep to a flood of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, however remote it may ſeem at preſent."<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     </gap>n. p. 26.</note> Yea, and ſupporting religious teachers by compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hath been a greater ſource of perſecution, than a compelling of people to keep days of faſting or thankſgiving ever was. Of this Mr. Eden Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs, paſtor of the church in Hanover, became ſo ſenſible that he gave up the practice. He had been a miniſter in Connecticut, and he was ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with a view of the corruption of their church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that he publiſhed a diſcourſe in 1784 from thoſe words, <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I ſay?</hi> And he plainly ſhews that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of men, be it in obedience to the laws of Chriſt, or in conformity to the world, is the language which ſpeaks the loudeſt in all rational minds, and much more to the Son of God. And he ſays, "If the confidence of profeſſing Chriſtians one towards an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other is not founded upon a mutual apprehenſion that each other is governed by a ſacred regard to what Chriſt has ſaid and enjoined in his word, there is no Chriſtian confidence, and conſequently no Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian charity amongſt them—And it is abſolutely impoſſible for profeſſing Chriſtians to have <hi>this</hi> mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual confidence towards each other, while they ſee that they are ſo commonly diſpoſed to bite and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour one another, by ſeeking to get the advantage of each other, in their commerce and dealings; or to ſtander, backbite, and reproach one another; or to be unfaithful in fulfilling their promiſes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to each other; or to be inſenſible of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>lreſſes of each other." Again he ſays,
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:030011_0290_0FE3C204B5EC7D38"/>"There is nothing that can have ſuch a tendency to prejudice the minds and harden the hearts of men againſt the truth, as on the one hand to hold it up to view as being of the moſt ſacred and weighty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and on the other hand to trifle with it in our daily practice. And this one obſervation is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to account for that flood of deiſm and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity that ſo awfully threatens to deluge the land. It is in vain for profeſſing Chriſtians to call upon mankind to believe that which it is evident, by their daily practice, they do not believe themſelves.— Thoſe corporations who call themſelves churches of Chriſt, whilſt they refuſe to put the laws of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into execution, and will ſuffer them to be tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled under foot, are more awfully guilty of the blood of ſouls than every other ſet of men under heaven."<note n="*" place="bottom">Borroughs on the Laws of Chriſt, p. 14, 67, 68.</note> Theſe things cauſed many controverſies among their churches, as well as moved many to withdraw from them. And we are informed that elder Seamans hath found it to be ſuch a bondage to be ſupported by tax and compulſion, that he hath lately renounced that practice.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. A foundation doctrine of Chriſtianity was alſo openly ſtruck againſt in this part of our country, even the atonement of Chriſt. For a miniſter of Newport publiſhed three ſermons in 1786, to prove that all the ſufferings of Chriſt were from wicked men and devils, and that God never inflicted any puniſhment at all upon him for the ſins of men; but that the whole of the atonement of Chriſt was his good teaching and good example in life and death. His firſt argument for this opinion is this, "Nothing could merit favour for ſinners, which was not in itſelf agreeable to the divine mind." And having proved that God has no pleaſure in the death of ſinners, he ſays, "Reaſon forbids the concluſion, that he ſhould have any pleaſure in the ſufferings of
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:030011_0291_0FE3C199539BDA08"/>his dutiful and well beloved Son."<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     </gap> on Atonement, p. 19.</note> But we ought to know, that the favour and love of God never could be purchaſed; for it was his love that cauſed him to give his Son to ſuffer the curſe of the law, that God might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him who believeth in Jeſus. Where is boaſting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay, but by the law of faith. Rom. iii. 24—27. And if men deny that God could have any pleaſure in the death of his Son, yet he ſays, It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief: when thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his days, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand. He ſhall ſee of the travail of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: by his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtify many, for he ſhall bear their iniquities. Iſaiah liii. 10, 11. Chriſt loved us, and hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us, an offering and a ſacrifice to God for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour. Eph. v. 2. Wherefore he is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for them. Heb. vii. 25. Yet this author, in his ſecond argument, ſays, "If this great work could not be finiſhed until divine juſtice had its free and natural courſe, in ſuch a ſenſe, as that his ſufferings are to be conſidered as ſin puniſhed; the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is unavoidable, that he in a <hi>very ſhort ſeaſon</hi> endured the ſame quantity of miſery which would have borne ſinners down to eternity. A thought which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all rules of computation, and departs from all principles of juſt reaſoning." As if the Son of God could not do more in a ſhort time, than ſinful men can ever do. Man was firſt drawn, into rebellion againſt God, by ſetting up reaſon above revelation; and the world is ſtill held in bondage by the ſame means. Yet our author ſays, "Let no one be
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:030011_0292_0FE3C20889E7C058"/>alarmed, if we poſitively deny, that he ſuffered any of that divine wrath which ſinners juſtly deſerve; for there can no ſuch contradictory idea exiſt, that a being ſhould be <hi>angry</hi> with an object with which he is at the ſame time <hi>well pleaſed.</hi>"<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 21, 33.</note> But how weak is this reaſoning! For a parent cannot correct a child as he ought, if he is angry with the child; neither can a judge give ſentence againſt a debtor, or a criminal, if he feels angry with them. And when a ſurety freely engages to pay the debt of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, juſtice as clearly exacts the debt of him as of the debtor, while the diſcharge of the debtor is as great a mercy as it would have been if the creditor had forgiven him without a ſurety. And when a ſinner is convinced of the greatneſs of his debt, and God frankly forgives him all, the ſinner will love him much. Luke vii. 41, 42, 47. For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead; and that he died for all, that they which live ſhould not hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth live unto themſelves, but unto him who died for them, and roſe again.—Therefore if any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature; old things are paſt away, behold, all things are become new. 2 Cor. v, 14—17. Fear and love are the great principles of all voluntary actions, and they were divided by the fall; but Chriſt took on him fleſh and blood, of the ſeed of Abraham, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their life-time ſubject to bondage. Heb. ii. 14—16. And herein the promiſe of God to Abraham was accompliſhed, who ſaid, My covenant ſhall be in your fleſh for an everlaſting covenant. Gen. xvii. 13. For Chriſt was given for a covenant of the people, and for a light of the Gentiles. Iſaiah xlii. 6.</p>

               <p n="1">I. THE royal prophet ſays, Surely the wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee: the remainder of wrath ſhalt thou reſtrain. And this truth ſhines with great clearneſs in our day, and as clearly in Vermont, as in any part of our country. All the lands therein were once claimed by the government of New-Hampſhire, and Bennington was named from Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Wentworth, the governor who granted the town. He alſo granted a large number of other towns on the weſt ſide of Connecticut-river, and made much money thereby, until ſome politicians of New York obtained an act of the king in council, in 1764, to annex all thoſe lands to their government. Many of thoſe who had purchaſed lands of Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, had made large improvements thereon; and to have all their property taken away deceitfully, or to buy it again of men whoſe government they diſliked, raiſed a high degree of reſentment againſt them; and the controverſy was purſued for ten years, which produced a hardy ſet of men, who did great exploits in the American war, in the time of which they formed themſelves into a diſtinct government, and they are now owned as one of our United States.<note n="*" place="bottom">Balknap's Hiſtory of New-Hampſhire, Vol. II, p. 314—316, 455.</note>
                  <pb n="295" facs="unknown:030011_0294_0FE3C20E026DFA90"/>And the folly of many in Connecticut and the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, who ran into debt at the cloſe of the wars in 1763 and 1783, cauſed the planting of the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in New-Hampſhire and Vermont, beyond what human wiſdom could poſſibly have done. The Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts had made ſome beginnings at Northfield before the war which began in 1675, and we are well informed that there was not one Engliſh family ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled above Number Four, about fifty miles from Northfield, until the peace of 1763. In all that time the French and Engliſh were contending with each other about lands which neither of them had any right to, and were employing the Savages in their quarrels until the French gave up their claim to this continent. And then Britain engaged in the cruel deſign of enſlaving her own ſubjects, and forced them to renounce their power, and the French aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in obtaining their liberty, and thereby learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how to aſſert their own rights; upon which Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain hath deluged their land with blood, to prevent the prevalence of light and liberty in Europe. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery is aboliſhed in France, much more than it is in England, and this hath raiſed the cry of many teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and lawyers againſt them, repreſenting them as bloody infidels! But we ever ſhould remember, that hypocrites were much more fierce for the crucifixion or our Lord Jeſus Chriſt than Heathen infidels were; and they are ever ſo againſt true religion and liberty. And can men be blinded by them any longer? For God ſent ſuch a drought and ſcarcity into Canada in 1795, as compelled them to have recourſe to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont and New-Hampſhire for food for man and beaſt, where they had a plenty of both. Yea, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland herſelf now wants food from America, where they have cruelly oppreſſed the inhabitants heretofore.</p>

On Auguſt 4, 1774, the church wrote that they had thirty-nine members, twenty-one of whom were males. But how things were among them for ſix years after, we know not. A ſecond church was formed in 1780, and a third in 1781, the laſt of them upon the principles of the old Baptiſts, who held laying on of hands upon every member as a term of communion. And the Aſſociation which was begun there in 1781, and hath united a large num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other churches, yet hath not united all theſe in the town where it began. But to promote union among them, many of the brethren ſent an earneſt requeſt to Mr. Caleb Blood, of Newton, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved there in the beginning of 1788, when a fourth church was formed, which had one hundred and twenty-four members the next year, and one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty in 1795. Mr. Blood is ſo much eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed in their government, that he was called to preach their Election Sermon, October 11, 1792, which was publiſhed by their authority. One paſſage therein ſays, "A wiſe magiſtrate will ſet a conſtant guard over the words of his mouth; that with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming moderation, he may expreſs his reſentment of injuries done him, and have all his language ſuch as ſhall tend to prevent others from an uncivil, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane way of treating their fellow citizens. A magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate who is rough and profane in his language, is a monſtrous character. He is not civil himſelf, and we cannot expect but that the practice, at leaſt, will do hurt in the community. He is not the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for any perſon of ſenſe knows, that a rough, profane way of treating mankind, better fits the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:030011_0296_0FE3C213857BE288"/>of a clown than a gentleman. Can I ſuppoſe myſelf in danger of giving offence?

               <p n="3">III. After the ſettlement of Pownal, the people lived for ſome time in a very careleſs way, neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing public worſhip, and indulging themſelves in all kinds of vanity and iniquity, until they were viſited with diſtreſſing ſickneſs, in March, 1773, which alarmed their conſciences, and they ſet up the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God among them, and the Spirit of God fixed conviction in many minds, and about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred often attended their meetings. A church was formed in April, which increaſed to 49 members in fifteen months. This is a ſummary of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which the church gave in July, 1774. How things were among them for ten years after, we know not; but in the ſpring of 1788, elder Caleb Nichols removed there, having been diſmiſſed from the church in Coventry, and this church joined to the Shaftſbury Aſſociation in 1793, when they had ſeventy-two members; and ſuch a bleſſing was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, that they increaſed to one hundred and ſixty-five in two years.

As people removed very faſt into this county towards the cloſe of the war, ſeveral Baptiſt miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were ſent to preach among them from year to year. In May, 1779, our elders Seamans and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doyt viſited thoſe parts, and laboured in various places to good purpoſe. And Mr. Eliſha Ranſom, who was ordained at Sutton, November 11, 1778, is a travelling miniſter, removed up to Woodſtock,

He came as one of their meſſengers, and joined the Warren Aſſociation in September following, when they had twenty-eight members. And in three years they increaſed to eighty members, when, in February, 1783, they joined with three other churches in forming the Woodſtock Aſſociation, to which a fifth church join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that year, and opened a correſpondence with the Warren Aſſociation, which hath continued ever ſince. In three years the Aſſociation increaſed to fourteen churches, and four hundred and ninety-ſix members. Theſe churches were thoſe of Woodſtock, Canaan, Croydon, Sutton, Wendel, Lebanon, Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alton, ſecond in Woodſtock, Claremont, Temple, Windſor, Weſtminſter, Weſtmoreland, and Marlow. Mr. Joel Butler was ordained in Woodſtock, Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry 5, 1785, and miniſtered to their ſecond church for ſome time, and then he laboured in ſeveral places in the Maſſachuſetts, from whence he removed into the State of New-York. As the members of this church were chiefly diſmiſſed from the firſt, they have ſince re-united in one again. Mr. William Grow, mentioned above, removed from Pomfret, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, to Bridgwater, in Vermont, and recovered his credit ſo far, by a penitent and good behaviour, that he was ſettled as the paſtor of a church gathered in Woodſtock and Bridgwater, and for two or three years they appeared to proſper; but then new diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties aroſe, and he was diſmiſſed. I find that Mr. John Peckens, who went from Middleborough, and who had been ordained at Claremont, was at Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock in 1786, who is now at Chelmsford. Mr. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Call was alſo an ordained elder there in 1789, who was at Cambridge in 1793. This work has ſpread into Canada, where a Baptiſt church was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Coldwell's Manor, which joined to the Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock Aſſociation in 1794. And elder Jedidiah Heb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard

               <p n="5">V. Mr. Ranſom has not only been a ſucceſsful preacher of the goſpel, but alſo has earneſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for Chriſtian liberty, againſt the miniſterial tyranny which hath been carried into that wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, from the States of Connecticut and the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts. And on March 23, 1795, he ſaid in a letter, "A brother living in Hartford, in Vermont, belonging to elder Drew's church, has ſuffered much about rates from another denomination. He was firſt carried to gaol, and then came out by paying the money, and proſecuted them in vain, for he was beat three times. I cannot aſcertain the coſts, for his laſt trial was the laſt day of February paſt; but it is ſuppoſed that his coſts will be above fifty pounds. Five petitions were carried into the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont aſſembly laſt fall, with more than two hundred ſigners, againſt the certificate law, and I went to ſpeak for them; and after my averment that the certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate law was contrary to the rights of man, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the firſt, third, fourth, and ſeventh articles of our conſtitution, and to itſelf, for it took away our rights, and then offered to ſell them back to us for a certificate, ſome ſtretched their mouths; and though no man contradicted me in one argument, yet they would ſhut their eyes, and ſay they could not ſee it ſo. I had many great friends in the houſe, but not a majority. They ſent out a committee who altered the law much for the better, if any law could be good of that kind, which was, that every man might aſſert his own ſentiments to the town clerk, and that ſhould anſwer; but becauſe it would ſtill be a bad law, and I would not thank them for it, and none of our friends would acknowledge it as a ſavour, it fell back to where it was before. Only we have this to comfort us, The Lord reigneth, and
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:030011_0299_0FE3BB539C6E6588"/>their power is limited, and we ſhall have no more affliction than is needful for us. Duty is ours, the event is the Lord's." And as I failed of obtaining more accounts of their churches, and of their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in Vermont, which were expected, I ſhall cloſe this chapter with ſome late things in the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, the mother of all the perſecutions in New-England.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. God ſaid to the church of Iſrael, Behold ye faſt for ſtrife and debate, and to ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſs.—Wilt thou call this a faſt, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable day to the Lord? Is not this the faſt that I have choſen? to looſe the bands of wickedneſs, and to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Iſaiah lviii. 4—6. And is not this language applicable to our country? For diſſenters from the eſtabliſhed worſhip in New-England were ſeveral times relieved from cruel oppreſſion, by ſpecial acts of the Britiſh court. But when our firſt Congreſs was called at Philadelphia, in the fall of 1774, and they were like to be our higheſt power of government for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Warren Aſſociation ſent an agent there to try if ſome ſecurity for our religious rights could not be obtained, while we united with our country-men in defence of the civil rights of America. And a conference was granted by the delegates in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs from the Maſſachuſetts, to whom the Baptiſt agent declared, that we wanted no more religious liberty in the country, than they had long enjoyed in Boſton; and this appeared ſo reaſonable to the gentlemen who were preſent, that ſaid delegates promiſed to uſe their influence to obtain ſuch liberty through all the country. Yet a report was ſpread in New-England, before the Baptiſt agent got home, that he had been to Philadelphia on purpoſe to try to break the union of the colonies in the defence of their civil rights. Therefore he ſoon met the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:030011_0300_0FE3BB4A2A9B68E0"/>of the Warren Aſſociation at Boſton, and preſented an addreſs to the Maſſachuſetts provincial congreſs upon it, and they returned an anſwer in which they ſaid, "The eſtabliſhment of civil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious liberty, to each denomination in the province, is the ſincere wiſh of this congreſs: But being by no means veſted with powers of civil government, whereby they can redreſs the grievances of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whatever, they therefore recommend to the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt churches, that when a General Aſſembly ſhall be convened in this colony, they lay the real grievances of ſaid churches before the ſame, when and where their petition will moſt certainly meet with all that attention due to the memorial of a denomination of Chriſtians ſo well diſpoſed to the public weal of their country." Here they denied that they were veſted with powers of civil government, while they aſſumed the whole power of government in the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts; and as a General Aſſembly was called in July, 1775, the Warren Aſſociation preſented a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial to them in September, which they ſlipped away out of ſight, without granting any relief at all to the Baptiſts. And when the convention was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who formed our new conſtitution, the firſt draught that was made by their committee, was wholly partial for one denomination. They met and choſe the committee to make the draught in September, and then adjourned to October 28, 1779. A general faſt was appointed upon the occaſion on November 4; and though the third article was new drawn, with ſome appearance of favour to diſſenters from their worſhip, yet as they expected oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it from the Baptiſts, two men, who were members of Congreſs in 1774, accuſed them of ſending an agent then to Philadelphia to break the union of the colonies, and evidently carried the vote for the third article by enflaming the convention againſt them. And was not this a faſting for ſtrife
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:030011_0301_0FE3BB4F605AEDB0"/>and debate, and ſmiting with the fiſt of wickedneſs? For the ſame men knew that they had promiſed to exert all their influence to obtain all the liberty that the Baptiſts aſked for; but they have never fulfilled their promiſe to this day, although they have been in high offices in our government. And for any men to violate their promiſe, is to exalt themſelves above the eternal God, who never failed of fulfilling any one promiſe, nor ever can. Yet all men in this government, who ſupport one denomination by tax and compulſion, violate the promiſe in the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſays, "Every denomination of Chriſtians demeaning themſelves peaceably, and as good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the commonwealth, ſhall be equally under the protection of the law; and no ſubordination of any one ſect or denomination to another, ſhall ever be eſtabliſhed by law."</p>
               <p n="7">VII. But as this has reſtrained our legiſlature from making any certificate law to exempt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters from the Congregational denomination from taxes to their worſhip, and they have put the whole power into the hands of the majority of voters in each town or pariſh, this iniquity has no covering left among us. For miniſters are ſupported by worldly men, who act without any ſort of religious qualification, and therefore there is no religion in their doings. And they now violate the moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial rule of all civil government, which is, that the majority of every civil community is the body poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, and that the minority is not the body. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. Ellis was never elected as paſtor of the firſt pariſh in Rehoboth,<note n="*" place="bottom">Juſt before this work was finiſhed at the preſs, news came from Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, that a number who had been zealous for Mr. Ellis have turned againſt him, ſo that he is gone off, not likely to return to be their miniſter any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </note> from whom many thouſands of dollars have been taken for him; neither was Mr. Nathan Underwood ever elected the paſtor of the ſecond pariſh in Harwich, by the body of the pariſh, who have been all taxed to him. But Mr. Ellis's
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:030011_0302_0FE3BB5879F0AFF8"/>great ſucceſs appears to have emboldened Mr. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwood, and his collector ſeized ſix men who were Baptiſts, on the firſt day of December, 1795, and carried them as far as Yarmouth, where one of them was taken ſo ill, being old and infirm before, that he ſaw no way to ſave his life but to pay the tax and coſts, which he did, and the other five were carried to the priſon at Barnſtable, where they alſo paid the money, rather than to lie in a cold priſon all winter. And theſe things moved many to pay ſaid tax, rather than to be ſtrained upon. Though as all did not do it, their collector went with aid to the houſe of one of the Baptiſts, when he was not at home, January 8, 1796, and ſeized a cow for a tax to ſaid miniſter; but his wife and daughter came out and took hold of the cow, and his wife promiſed to pay the money, if her huſband would not do it, and they let the cow go, and ſhe went to Mr. Underwood the next day, and paid the tax and coſts, and took his receipt therefor. Yet four days after, the woman and two daughters, one of whom was not there when the cow was taken, were ſeized and carried before au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and fined ſeven dollars, for talking to the collector and his aid, and taking hold of the cow while they had her in poſſeſſion, ſo that they let her go. Theſe things we have had very diſtinct accounts of, and if there is the leaſt miſtake therein, let them point it out in welcome. Another inſtance in the county of Plymouth is ſimilar to theſe in one reſpect, though not in others. The miniſter of a pariſh, lately incorporated, was never choſen by the major<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the inhabitants therein, nor by many who are taxed to him, one of whom was lately ſeized to be carried to priſon, but he paid the money, and others are threatened with the like treatment. Before this diſtreſs was made for the ſalary of ſaid miniſter, he got ſeveral Baptiſt miniſters to preach in his pulpit, and ſeems to be in earneſt to draw them into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:030011_0303_0FE3C26311660E48"/>meaſures alſo. Yet the line of his pariſh was extended eight or nine miles from his meeting, in order to take in two valuable lots of miniſterial lands, which lie near a Baptiſt meeting, where a Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt miniſter is ſettled. Theſe are a few of the evils which have come from the practice of confounding the church and world together, about the government of the church, and the ſupport of religious miniſters. Whereas if the civil government would protect all its ſubjects impartially, without ſupporting any min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters by tax and compulſion, all true believers would lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty, and the power of other men to oppreſs them on religious accounts would be taken away.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">I. HOW clearly hath the word of God been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled! For he ſays, That day ſhall not come except there come a falling away firſt, and that man of ſin be revealed, the ſon of perdition: who oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped; ſo that he, as God, ſitteth in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God. And now ye know what withholdeth, that he might be revealed in his time. For the myſtery of iniquity doth already work; only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way: and then ſhall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume with the ſpirit of his mouth, and ſhall deſtroy with the brightneſs of his coming: even him, whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſigns, and lying wonders, and with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs in them that periſh;
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:030011_0305_0FE3C2204193BB78"/>becauſe they received not the love of the truth that they might be ſaved. And for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion that they ſhould believe a lie; that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs. But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, becauſe God hath from the beginning choſen you to ſalvation, through ſanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth: whereunto he called you by our goſpel, to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. 2 Theſſ. ii. 3—14. Here all men are deſcribed as in two parties. So our Lord ſays, Every one that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved. But he that doth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt that they are wrought in God. John iii. 20, 21. It is impoſſible for God to violate his promiſe, or his oath, or to entice any into ſin. Heb. vi. 13—18. James i. 13, 14. But all men are guilty of theſe evils, more or leſs, who are not born again. And when Conſtantine removed the ſeat of his empire from Rome, and then divided it at his death, the way was made for the biſhop of Rome to exalt himſelf above God in his church, and above all the kings of Europe, who gave their power unto him. And forbidding to marry, and commanding to abſtain from meats, was held in that church for many centuries before Luther's ref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormation. 1 Tim. iv. 1, 2, 3. Yet an external ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of baptiſms, and of miniſterial power, through all thoſe abominations, is now held faſt in our land, as we have before proved. Yea, and the doctrine of original ſin, particular election, efficacious grace in converſion, juſtification wholly by faith in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and the final perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his ſaints, is denied by multitudes in Europe and America. And are they not left to a ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:030011_0306_0FE3C226739790B8"/>to believe a lie? For all the holy prieſthood that God hath under heaven are, <hi>Elect</hi> according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the Spirit unto obedience, and ſprinkling of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt. 1 Pet. i. 2. ii. 5, 9. Yet miniſters and parents ſtill imagine, that they can make children holy members of the church before they can chooſe for themſelves, and holy miniſters by an external ſucceſſion of ordinations. And a miniſter before named ſays, "When you re-baptize thoſe in adult years, which we have baptized in their infancy, you and they jointly renounce that Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, whom we adore and worſhip as the only living and true God, and on whom we depend for all our ſalvation."<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Huntington, the author of this, died in 1795, when it appeared that he had embraced the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation.</note> So ſome Jewiſh teachers ſaid, Except ye be circumciſed, after the manner of Moſes, ye cannot be ſaved. But the Holy Ghoſt, in the church at Jeruſalem, ſaid, Why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? Acts xv. 1, 10. The Sinai covenant yoked believers and unbelievers together. And another miniſter ſays, "Some who are not inwardly ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, are yet ſo far in covenant, that they are right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful members of the viſible church, as all but the Anabaptiſts muſt grant." And again he ſays, "It is certain that the rule of admiſſion is ſuch, that ſome, yea, many unſanctified perſons may be, and are regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly admitted. All the congregation of Iſrael were admitted or recognized as members of the viſible church by God himſelf at mount Sinai; yet who will ſay that one in ten of them were ſaints in heart? The children of believers are reputed ſaints, and as ſuch, have a right of admiſſion; yet we are not ſure that the greater part of them are inwardly ſanctified from the womb, or even afterwards."<note n="†" place="bottom">Hemmenway on the Church. p. 29, 49.</note> Yea, we are ſo
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:030011_0307_0FE3C22B228251F0"/>far from ſeeing any evidence of inward ſanctification in moſt of the children of profeſſors, that they gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally evidence the contrary in their lives as much as other men. And when the church of Iſrael were entering upon the promiſed land, Moſes ſaid, The Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to ſee, and ears to hear unto this day. Deut. xxix. 4. So far was he from giving them any idea that all their national church were inwardly ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. But a little before the Babylonian captivity, it was ſaid, Behold, the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a <hi>new covenant</hi> with the houſe of Iſrael, and with the houſe of Judah; <hi>not according</hi> to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt (which my covenant they brake, although I was an huſband unto them, ſaith the Lord;) but this ſhall be the covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael, After thoſe day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, ſaith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people: and they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know ye the Lord: for they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt of them unto the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of them, ſaith the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their ſin no more. Jer. xxxi. 31—34. And this is the covenant upon which the goſpel church is built. Heb. viii. 8—12. And it is as diſtinct from the covenant of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with the nation of Iſrael, as Sarah was from Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, or Zion from Sinai; yea, as diſtinct as Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem which is above, and is free, being the mother of all the children of God, is from Jeruſalem below, which is in bondage with her children. Gal. iv. 22—26. And language cannot make a clearer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, than is here made, between the national covenant with Iſrael, and the covenant of grace with the church of Chriſt.</p>

II. When the Jews returned from Babylon, and began to build the temple, their enemies ſent falſe accuſations againſt them to the court of Perſia, and procured an order from thence to force them to ceaſe from that work. But after another king came to the throne, two prophets were raiſed up, to reprove the Jews for their negligence, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to finiſh the houſe of God. Ezra iv. 11—24. v. 1, 2. And becauſe the old men wept to ſee how much inferior this houſe was, to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious temple which was built by Solomon, one prophet ſaid to them, I am with you, ſaith the Lord of hoſts; according to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, ſo my <hi>Spirit</hi> remaineth among you; fear ye not. For thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, Yet once, it is a little while, and I will ſhake the heavens and the earth, and the ſea, and the dry land; and I will ſhake all nations, and the Deſire of all Nations ſhall come, and I will fill this houſe with glory, ſaith the Lord of hoſts. Hag. ii. 4—7. And after the Son of God came and taught in that houſe, as no man ever did before, and then offered himſelf a ſacrifice to God for the ſins of his people, and aroſe and aſcended to Heaven, and gave the Holy Ghoſt from thence, to enable his miniſters to preach the goſpel to Jews and Gentiles, an inſpired apoſtle ſaid, Yet once more, ſignifieth the removing of thoſe things that are ſhaken, as of things that are made, that thoſe things which cannot be ſhaken may remain. Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may ſerve God acceptably, with rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and godly fear; for our God is a conſuming fire. Heb. xii. 27—29. The other prophet had a candleſtick all of gold, ſet before him, with medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums to convey oil into it for light; and upon his inquiry what was meant thereby, the anſwer was. This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:030011_0309_0FE3C2345BDCDFA0"/>Not by might, nor by power, but by my <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſaith the Lord of hoſts. Who art thou, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel thou ſhalt become a plain, and he ſhall bring forth the headſtone thereof with ſhoutings, crying, <hi>Grace, grace</hi> unto it! Zech. iv. 1—7. And when they obeyed this call of God, their enemies wrote again to the court of Perſia againſt them, but a decree in their favour was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured thereby, and all was plain before them. Ezra v. 7—17. vi. 1—16. The golden candleſtick repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the church of God, and the two olive-trees were his precepts and promiſes, whereby he poured the oil of his grace into his church, to hold up light to the world, who hated it becauſe it tormented their conſciences. Before the coming of Chriſt there was but one candleſtick, with two olive-trees to pour oil into it; but when Chriſt came he broke down the middle wall of partition between Jews and Gentiles, and built his church upon the foundation of the <hi>apoſtles</hi> and <hi>prophets,</hi> for an habitation of God through the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Eph. ii. 14—22. And when antichriſt aroſe, God ſaid, I will give power unto my two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and they ſhall prophecy a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore days, clothed in ſackcloth. Theſe are the two olive-trees, and the two candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks ſtanding before the God of the earth. And it is to be obſerved, that the church is in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the beaſt continues, all the time that theſe witneſſes prophecy in ſackcloth. Rev. xi. 3, 4. xii. 6, 14. xiii. 5. The two teſtaments, believed and obeyed by the children of God, appear to be the two witneſſes.</p>
               <p n="3">III. And a being <hi>anointed</hi> by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt, is eſſential to the name <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> For the diſciples were not called by this name, until after the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were received into the church without circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. Acts xi. 26. And it is ſaid, If ye be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached for the name of Chriſt, happy are ye; for

But let none of you ſuffer as a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, or as a thief, or as an evil doer, or as a buſy body in other men's matters. Yet if any man ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> let him not be aſhamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf. 1 Peter iv. 14—16. Ye are not in the fleſh, but in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> if ſo be that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt, he is none of his. Rom. viii. 9. Again it is ſaid, Hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the <hi>Spirit</hi> which he hath given us. 1 John iii. 24. And Jeſus ſaid, If a man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. Johm xiv. 23. Whoſoever tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſeth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God: he that abideth in the doctrine of Chriſt, he hath both the Father and the Son. If there come any unto you, and bring not this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, receive him not into your houſe, neither bid him God-ſpeed; for he that biddeth him God-ſpeed is partaker of his evil deeds. 2 John 9—11. And how clearly do theſe things ſhew, that no perſon can be a Chriſtian without a change of heart by the Spirit of Chriſt! Yea, and that receiving and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting true miniſters, and refuſing to receive falſe teachers, is ever a matter between God and individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uals, as much as faith in Chriſt is for eternal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! And no men can have any more right to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port religious teachers by the ſword, than they have power to pull down the Son of God from his throne in heaven. For he ſays, All they that take the ſword, ſhall periſh with the ſword. Matt. xxvi. 52. My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my ſervants fight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence. John xviii. 36. How
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:030011_0311_0FE3BB3E8B9299C8"/>then will any men dare to ſupport religious miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by the ſword of the magiſtrate? For his power is to puniſh none but thoſe who work ill to their neighbours; and it is a matter of conſcience with Chriſtians to be ſubject to ſuch rulers, who are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Rom. xiii. 1—10. But the royal prophet ſays of wicked rulers, They break in pieces thy people, O Lord, and afflict thine heritage. They ſlay the widow and ſtranger, and murder the fatherleſs. Yet they ſay, The Lord ſhall not ſee, neither ſhall the God of Jacob regard it.—Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowſhip with thee, which frameth miſchief by a law?—The Lord at thy right hand ſhall ſtrike through kings in the day of his wrath. He ſhall judge among the heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, he ſhall fill the places with the dead bodies, he ſhall wound the heads over many countries. Pſalm xciv. 5—20. cx. 5, 6. And how awfully is he now doing it! Rev. xix. 11—21.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. And is it not evident that the late increaſe of Baptiſt churches hath been cauſed by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Spirit of God? For before he poured out his Spirit in the county of Hampſhire, in and after 1734, there were but ſix Baptiſt churches in all New-England, except in Rhode-Iſland govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein are now two hundred and eighty-five churches. And in theſe four States, where miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have been ſupported by law, all the power of ſuch miniſters and rulers have been againſt the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt churches; and they have found ſo much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in ſupporting their own miniſters, and in guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt oppreſſion from others, that ſome ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have obtained incorporations by the laws of men. But our Aſſociations have publiſhed teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies againſt all ſuch incorporations, as they implicitly deny that the laws and Spirit of Chriſt are ſufficient to govern his church, and to ſupport his miniſters. And while they act all the affairs of their Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:030011_0312_0FE3C23E06A4E1C8"/>openly, before all men who have a mind to hear them, and then publiſh their concluſions to the world, how can they hope for any earthly advantage thereby? If heavely influence hath not increaſed their churches, what cauſe can be aſſigned therefor? All true believers in Chriſt are born again, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God. John i. 12, 13. Natural deſcent, the power of our own wills, and of the wills of other men, are all excluded from this affair. And where the oppoſite principles have crept into Baptiſt churches, their welfare has been obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby, and many ſuch churches have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. Yet the word and Spirit of God have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed old churches, and raiſed many new ones in all parts of America. There was one Baptiſt church in Virginia, and a few in the Carolinas ſeventy years ago; but they were dark and feeble ſocieties, until ſome ſpiritual preachers were ſent among them, in and after 1753. The elders, Benjamin Miller, Iſaac Stelle, Peter Peterſon Vanhorne, and John Gano, went from New-Jerſey and Pennſylvania, and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe parts to good purpoſe. And elder Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bael Stearns, Daniel Marſhall, and others, went from Connecticut, and ſpent their lives in thoſe part, as was before obſerved; and how great has been the increaſe of the Baptiſt churches in thoſe ſouthern States! And though vaſt pains have been taken, by men who have ſupported their worſhip by force, to make the people believe that the Baptiſts were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to good government, yet how are they now confounded in thoſe attempts! For it now appears that government and liberty are united in their plan of conduct, which tends to bring all wars to an end. And in a prophecy concerning that glorious event, it is ſaid, All people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:030011_0313_0FE3C241A92084C8"/>Lord our God forever and ever. Micah iv. 5. All men who love any creature above the Creator are idolaters.</p>
               <p n="5">V. But our Lord ſays, If ye keep my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ye ſhall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.—If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but becauſe ye are not of the world, but I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. John xv. 10, 19. How then will any men dare to confound the church and world together in religious affairs? For as long as natural birth could bring the children of Iſrael into the church, and into the prieſthood, God ſaid to them, The man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adultereſs ſhall ſurely be put to death. Levir. xx. 10. And he now ſays to all the world, Ye adulterers and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſes, know ye not that the friendſhip of the world in enmity with God? Whoſoever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.—There is one lawgiver, who is able to ſave, and to deſtroy: who art thou that judgeſt another? James iv. 4, 12. Yet men in general have aſſumed the power of law-givers and judges for the church of Chriſt, and of bringing children into it before they could chooſe for themſelves; and they have invented a multitude of other names and denominations of men, beſides the righteous and the wicked, the church and the world. Though the word of revelation ſays, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin; for his ſeed remaineth in him; and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God. In this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the devil: whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs, is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. For this is the meſſage that ye have heard from the beginning, that we
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:030011_0314_0FE3C246E979C088"/>ſhould love one another. Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and ſlew his brother: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſlew he him? Becauſe his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous. 1 John iii. 9—12. Woe unto them; for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and periſhed in the gainſaying of Core. Jude 11. Becauſe the worſhip of Abel, by faith in the blood of Chriſt, was accepted of God, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Cain without ſuch faith was not accepted, he was filled with envy againſt his brother. But the Lord ſaid unto Cain, If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doſt not well, ſin lieth at the door. And unto thee ſhall be his deſire, and thou ſhalt rule over him. Gen. iv. 4—7. True be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have ever been the beſt ſubjects of civil gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment; but men have diſcovered enmity againſt them in every age, becauſe of the light of holineſs which God hath cauſed to ſhine in their lives, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the hypocriſy and wickedneſs of others. But every man is guilty of <hi>adultery,</hi> who hath not been made dead to the works of the law, in order to be married to Jeſus Chriſt. Rom. vii. 1—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. For every true Chriſtian hath been preſented as a <hi>chaſte virgin</hi> to him. 2 Cor. xi. 2. But after God had conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Moſes as the lawgiver to his church, and Aaron and his lawful poſterity to be the only prieſts therein, to offer ſacrifices for iniquity, until Jeſus came and offered himſelf without ſpot to God for ſinners, Korah gathered a large company againſt them, ſaying, Ye take too much upon you, ſeeing all the congregation are holy every one of them, and the Lord is among them; wherefore then lift you up yourſelves above the congregation of the Lord? But for this they periſhed moſt terribly. Numb. xvi. 1—3, 32, 33. This gives a plain view of the way of Cain, the error of Balaam, and the gainſaying of Core, which evils many have charged upon believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:030011_0315_0FE3C24C13EE8618"/>becauſe they have held to ſalvation by faith in the perfect righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and to have his church governed by his laws, which admit none into it without a credible profeſſion of the new birth. Thus men have called evil good, and good evil; have put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs, bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter. Iſaiah v. 20.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. But an inſpired apoſtle ſays, We have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the ſpirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things alſo we ſpeak, not in the words which man's wiſdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring ſpiritual things with ſpiritual. 1 Cor. ii. 12, 13. And let us now attend to this rule. For God ſays, Thy Maker is thine huſband (the Lord of hoſts is his name;) and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Iſrael, the God of the whole earth ſhall he be called.— And all thy <hi>children</hi> ſhall be taught of the Lord, and great ſhall be the peace of thy <hi>children.</hi> And Jeſus ſays, No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me, draw him; and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day. It is written in the prophets, And they ſhall be all taught of God. Every <hi>man</hi> therefore that hath heard, and hath <hi>learned</hi> of the Father, cometh unto me. Iſaiah liv. 5, 13. John vi. 44, 45. The <hi>children</hi> of the church of Chriſt, are <hi>men,</hi> who have been taught of God, and have <hi>learned</hi> of the Father, ſo as to come to the Son. So Paul ſays, Jeruſalem which is above, is free, which is the <hi>mother</hi> of us all. Gal. iv. 26. And John ſays, I ſaw the holy city, new Jeruſlem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a <hi>bride</hi> adorned for her huſband. Rev. xxi. 2. And Jeſus ſays, Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither caſt ye your pearls before ſwine, left they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rent you.—The kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchantman,
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:030011_0316_0FE3C2515362D078"/>ſeeking goodly pearls; who when he had found one pearl of great price, he went and ſold all that he had, and bought it. Matt. vii. 6. xii, 45, 46. So likewiſe, whoſoever he be of you, that forſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my diſciple. Luke xiv. 33. Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God. John iii. 3. Every ſeveral gate was of one pearl.—Bleſſed are they that do his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. For without are dogs, and ſorcerers, and whoremongers, and adulterers, and whoſoever loveth and maketh a lie. I Jeſus have ſent mine angel to teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify unto you theſe things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning ſtar. And the Spirit and the bride ſay, Come. And let him that heareth, ſay, Come; and let him that is athirſt, come; and whoſoever will, let him take the water of life freely. Rev. xxi. 21. xxii. 14—17. And how clearly do theſe things ſhew, that the government of the church of Chriſt is as diſtinct from all worldly governments, as heaven is from earth! Yea, and that none has any true right in his church, until he comes to Chriſt by faith which worketh by love that is as free as water! For God ſays, In the laſt days it ſhall come to paſs, that the mountain of the houſe of the Lord ſhall be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the top of the mountains, and it ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above the hills, and people ſhall <hi>flow</hi> unto it. And many nations ſhall come and ſay, Come;and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the houſe of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for the law ſhall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem. And he ſhall judge among many people, and rebuke ſtrong nations afar off, and they ſhall beat their ſwords into ploughſhares, and their ſpears into pruning-hooks: nation ſhall not lift up
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:030011_0317_0FE3C2545D0C8600"/>ſword againſt nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more. Micah iv. 1—3. Now all men may know, that this prophecy hath never yet been fulfilled; but it will as ſurely be accompliſhed, as any prophecy ever was in this world. How earneſt then ſhould all be to hear and obey the revealed will of God!</p>
               <p n="7">VII. And no man can obey him without denying himſelf, and taking up his croſs, and following the example of Chriſt. And the apoſtle Paul ſays to the miniſters of Chriſt, I have not ſhunned to declare unto you all the counſel of God. Take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto yourſelves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood. For I know this, that after my departing ſhall grievous wolves enter in among you, not ſparing the flock. Alſo of yourſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw away diſciples after them. Therefore watch, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that by the ſpace of three years, I ceaſed not to warn every one night and day with tears. And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up, and to give you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> inheritance among all them which are ſanctified. I have coveted no man's ſilver, or gold, or apparel. Yea, you yourſelves know, that theſe hands have miniſtered unto my neceſſities, and to them that were with me. I have ſhewed you all things, how that ſo labouring ye ought to ſupport the weak; and to remember the words of the Lord Jeſus, how he ſaid, It is more bleſſed to give than to receive. Acts xx. 27—35. And how hath this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy been fulfilled in every age ſince it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed! And how few believe that God, and the word of his grace, is able to build up his church, and to guard againſt grievous wolves, and againſt perverſe ſchiſmatics, without the laws of men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by the ſword! Yea, how much hath the
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:030011_0318_0FE3C25A14D09530"/>ſword promoted both of theſe evils? And how little do we believe, that it is more bleſſed to give than to receive! It is bleſſed to receive, when we receive in a right manner; but all things below periſh in the uſing, while all that is given for the benefit of the bodies or ſouls of others, is laying up treaſure in heaven, which will turn to praiſe, honour and glory at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt. And though Paul had written to the church of Corinth, upon their duty to ſupport the preachers of the goſpel, yet as deceitful teachers had tried to deſtroy his character, pretending that he acted from ſelfiſh motives, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to receive any ſupport from them, until he could come and have thoſe accuſations tried before that church, in the mouth of two or three witneſſes, according to the law of Chriſt. But as his refuſal to receive any thing of them, as he did of other churches, might ſeem to be a diſhonour to the church of Corinth, he ſaid, Forgive me this wrong. 2 Cor. xi. 12. xii. 13. xiii. 1—4. And this ſhews that a particular church of Chriſt is the higheſt judicature that he has eſtabliſhed upon earth, to carry his laws into execution in his name. And the people alſo are to act towards their miniſters as they can anſwer it to God in the laſt day. For he ſays, The labourer is worthy of his reward. 1 Tim. v. 18. Let him that is taught in the word, communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap. For he that ſoweth to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption; but he that ſoweth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. And let us not be weary in well-doing; for in due ſeaſon we ſhall reap, if we faint not. Gal. vi. 6—9. Thus miniſters and people are required to act towards each other, as they can anſwer the ſame to God, who only can bleſs or curſe them in time and eternity. And Chriſt ſays to his miniſters, He
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:030011_0319_0FE3BB399AA234F0"/>that heareth you heareth me; and he that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me; and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him that ſent me. Luke x. 16. And how ſolemn are theſe conſiderations! Yea, and how ſafe are all true believers in Chriſt!</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. For he ſays, Upon this Rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it. Matt. xvi. 18. And though many have made ſtrange work of this ſaying, and others have paid no regard to it, yet many ancient paſſages may ſerve to explain its vaſt importance. For it is ſaid of God's people of old, When he ſlew them, then they ſought him; and they returned and inquired early after God. And they remembered that God was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer. Nevertheleſs, they did flatter him with their mouth, and they <hi>lied</hi> unto him with their tongues; for their <hi>heart</hi> was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his covenant. Pſalm lxxviii. 34—37. Wherefore hear the word of the Lord, ye ſcornful men that rule this people which is in Jeruſalem. Becauſe ye have ſaid, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcourge ſhall paſs through, it ſhall no come unto us; for we have made <hi>lies</hi> our refuge, and under falſehood have we hid ourſelves: therefore thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a ſtone, a tried ſtone, a precious corner-ſtone, a ſure foundation; he that believeth ſhall not make haſte. Judgment alſo will I lay to the line, and righteouſneſs to the plummet, and the hail ſhall ſweep away the refuge of <hi>lies,</hi> and the waters ſhall overflow the hiding place; and your covenant with death ſhall be diſannulled, and your agreement with hell ſhall not ſtand. Iſaiah xxviii. 14—18. And this prophecy is applied to them who followed after the law of righteouſneſs, but ſought it not by faith in Chriſt, but as it were by the works of the law. They
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:030011_0320_0FE3C25D52B35E68"/>had a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. For they being ignorant of God's righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted themſelves unto the righteouſneſs of God. For Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to every one that believeth. And whoſoever believeth on him, ſhall not be aſhamed. Rom. ix. 31—33. x. 1—4. He that believeth on him ſhall not be confounded. 1 Peter ii. 6. From whence we may learn, that all men who truſt in their own doings, inſtead of the perfect righteouſneſs of Chriſt, are in covenant with death, and at agreement with hell. And earthly monarchy has generally been the darling of ſuch men. Therefore God ſays to them, Thou wenteſt to the king with <hi>ointment,</hi> and didſt increaſe thy perfumes, and didſt ſend thy meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers afar off, and didſt debaſe thyſelf even unto hell. Thou art wearied in the greatneſs of thy way, yet ſaidſt thou not, There is no hope; thou haſt found the life of thine hand, therefore thou waſt not grieved. Iſaiah lvii. 9, 10. David, and his race of kings, were <hi>anointed</hi> of the Lord to their office, as eminent types of Chriſt. And the rage of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and infidels, againſt the Lord, and againſt his <hi>anointed,</hi> was againſt his <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Pſalm ii. 2. Acts iv. 26. And every child of God has the <hi>anointing</hi> of his Spirit abiding in him, which effectually teacheth the ſoul to abide in Chriſt. 1 John ii. 27. But the calling any ruler, ſince the death of Chriſt, The Lord's <hi>anointed,</hi> and the ſetting up any earthly heads to the church, is a practice which came from hell, from the bottomleſs pit; and this is the beaſt who cauſeth God's witneſſes to propheſy in mourning, and at length kills them. Rev. xi. 7. xiii. 1, 2, 12. xvii. 8.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. And the ſaints have a gradual victory over him. For John ſays, I ſaw as it were a ſea of glaſs, mingled with fire; and them that had gotten the
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:030011_0321_0FE3C265377524C0"/>victory over the beaſt, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, ſtand on the ſea of glaſs, having the harps of God. And they ſing the ſong of Moſes, the ſervant of God, and the ſong of the Lamb, ſaying, Great and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; juſt and true are thy ways, thou King of ſaints. Who ſhall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all nations ſhall come and worſhip before thee, for thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are made manifeſt. Rev. xv. 2—4. The ſea of glaſs, mingled with fire, is the word of God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced upon the ſouls of men by his Holy Spirit. For one apoſtle ſays, Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all with open face, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding as in a <hi>glaſs</hi> the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. 2 Cor. iii. 17, 18. And another ſays, Lay apart all filthineſs, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of naughtineſs, and receive with meekneſs the ingrafted word, which is able to ſave your ſouls. But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own ſelves. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a <hi>glaſs;</hi> for he behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf, and goeth his way, and ſtraightway for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth what manner of man he was. But whoſo looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed. James i. 21—25. And when a prophet met with moſt cruel treatment, he ſaid, I will not make mention of him, nor ſpeak any more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>fire</hi> ſhut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not ſtay. And God ſays, The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him ſpeak
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:030011_0322_0FE3C26AACDD32F0"/>my word faithfully: what is the chaff to the wheat? ſaith the Lord. Is not my word like as a <hi>fire?</hi> ſaith the Lord, and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces? Jer. xx. 9. xxiii. 28, 29. Therefore they who ſtand upon the ſea of glaſs mingled with fire, are they who hear and obey the revealed will of God. Moſes was the lawgiver to the church of Iſrael, and the Lamb is ſo to the church of God among all nations. And Moſes verily was faithful in all his houſe as a ſervant, for a teſtimony of thoſe things which were to be ſpoken after; but Chriſt as a Son over his own houſe; whoſe houſe are we, if we hold faſt the confidence, and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.—Now faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen. Heb. iii. 5, 6. xi. 1. And how clearly do theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages prove, that true believers in Chriſt are the only perſons of whom his houſe or church is compoſed! For no others can hold faſt the confidence, and the rejoicing of hope of ſalvation in Jeſus Chriſt. The beaſt appears to be the church of Rome, over many nations; his image, all national churches; his mark, all ſupporting of worſhip by tax and compulſion, and the number of his name, includes all the ſchemes of men to hold the church in bondage, ſo that ſhe might not be governed wholly by the laws of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="10">X. And this may lead us to conſider, what is intended by the killing and reſurrection of the two witneſſes. If they be the two parts of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, believed and obeyed by the children of God, then their death is the triumphing of the world over them. And the prophecy ſays, When they ſhall have finiſhed their teſtimony, the beaſt that aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of the bottomleſs pit ſhall make war againſt them, and ſhall overcome them, and kill them. And their dead bodies ſhall lie in the ſtreet of the great city, which ſpiritually is called Sadom and Egypt.
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:030011_0323_0FE3C274810254D0"/>where alſo our Lord was crucified. And they of the people, and kindreds, and tongues, and nations, ſhall ſee their dead bodies three days and an half, and ſhall not ſuffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. And they that dwell upon the earth ſhall rejoice over them, and make merry, and ſhall ſend gifts one to another; becauſe theſe two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth. Rev. xi. 7—10. Our Lord was crucified by hypocrites and infidels; and he declared thoſe hypocrites to be worſe than the old Sodomites. Matt. xi. 23, 24. Luke x. 12. And God ſaid in prophecy, Sodom thy ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath not done, ſhe nor her daughters, as thou haſt done, thou and thy daughters. Behold, this was the iniquity of Sodom, Pride, fulneſs of bread, and abundance of idleneſs was in her and in her daughters, neither did ſhe ſtrengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me; therefore I took them away as I ſaw good. Neither hath Samaria committed half thy ſins; but thou haſt multiplied thine abominations more than they.—Nevertheleſs, I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will eſtabliſh unto thee an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting covenant. Then thou ſhalt remember thy ways, and be aſhamed, when thou ſhalt receive thy ſiſters, thine elder and thy younger; and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enant. Ezek. xvi. 48—51, 60, 61. According to which prophecy, the church of Chriſt was erected in Jeruſalem, and ſhe received the Samaritans, and then the Gentiles into the church as daughters, but not by the covenant of circumciſion, which the Jews were in after the Samaritans were ſeparated from them. But this <hi>proverb,</hi> this high <hi>figure</hi> which God delivered to Jeruſalem, is now held up as a <hi>liter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al prophecy,</hi> that all the old Sodomites will finally be
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:030011_0324_0FE3C26FB5583C18"/>ſaved from hell.<note n="*" place="bottom">Wincheſter's Dialogues. p. 197—200.</note> Though God ſaid to Jeruſalem, Thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. Ezek. xvi. 3. Which could not be literally true, becauſe Abraham and Sarah ſprang from Shem, and the Amorites and Hittites from Ham. But it is ſaid of falſe teachers under the goſpel, As Jannes and Jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres withſtood Moſes, ſo do theſe alſo reſiſt the truth; men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 2 Tim. iii. 8. Jannes and Jambres were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians of Egypt, who hardened the heart of Pharaoh againſt the call of God, to let Iſrael go and ſerve him according to his own inſtitutions. And Sodom was never more ſet againſt purity, nor Egypt againſt lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, than the world now are againſt the purity and liberty of the goſpel. For truth is fallen in the ſtreet, and equity cannot enter. Iſaiah lix. 14. The nations of the world will not ſuffer <hi>a form</hi> of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be buried from among them; but how are they ſet againſt the power thereof! For as the body without the ſpirit is dead, ſo faith without works is dead alſo. James ii. 26. Thou haſt a name that thou liveſt, and art dead. Rev. iii. 1. Whereas an inſpired apoſtle ſaid, The law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the law of ſin and death. Rom. viii. 2. We having the ſame ſpirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I ſpoken; we alſo believe, and therefore ſpeak.—For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen: for the things which are ſeen, are tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; but the things which are not ſeen, are eternal. 2 Cor. iv. 13—18. But how is this life of faith now killed by a deceitful world!</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Though the prophecy ſays, After three days and an half, the Spirit of life from God entered into
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:030011_0325_0FE3C279950CD310"/>them; and they ſtood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon them which ſaw them. And they heard a great voice from heaven, ſaying unto them, Come up hither. And they aſcended up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies beheld them. And the ſame hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>in of men ſeven thouſand; and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven. The ſecond woe is paſt, and behold, the third woe cometh quickly. And the ſeventh angel ſounded, and there were great voices in heaven, ſaying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reign for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever. Rev. xi. 11—15. And we are to obſerve, that when the ſeventh angel ſhall begin to ſound his trumpet, the myſtery of God ſhall be fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed, as he hath declared by all his prophets. Rev. x. 7. So that the reſurrection of the two witneſſes, in the eleventh chapter, and the reſurrection of the ſouls of the faithful, in the twentieth chapter, appear to be the ſame glorious event, given under different views. For our Lord ſaid to John, Write the things which thou haſt ſeen, and the things which are, and the things which ſhall be hereafter. Rev. i. 19. When Chriſt was born of a virgin, in the true church of God, the nation of Iſrael was part of the Roman empire, which had ſeven heads, and ten horns; and Herod ſought to ſlay the child Jeſus, as ſoon as he was born, and Pilate crucified him, after which he was caught up unto God, and to his throne, where he will rule all nations with a rod of iron, and daſh them in pieces like a potter's veſſel. Rev. xii. 1—5. Luke i. 32, 33. Matt. ii. 3—16. xxvii. 24. Acts ii. 23, 24. iv. 25—28. Pſalm ii. 1—9. And theſe things John <hi>had ſeen.</hi> He had ſeen the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of Chriſt by the rulers of the Roman empire, urged on to do it by falſe teachers among the Jews;
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:030011_0326_0FE3C27EE5615218"/>for God had before ſaid, The ancient and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail. Iſaiah ix. 15. And deceitful teachers have ever been the meaneſt and worſt of all men upon earth, and they were the tail of the drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Roman empire. But no men who have ſuppoſed that this twelfth chapter ſpeaks of another child who ſhould be born after the apoſtolic age, could ever give any rational account of him. Many have ſuppoſed it was Conſtantine, the firſt emperor who owned the Chriſtian name; but he divided the empire, and prepared the way for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the man of ſin, as we have before proved. And after the aſcenſion of Chriſt to heaven, it was ſaid, Now is come ſalvation and ſtrength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Chriſt; for the accuſer of our brethren is caſt down, which accuſed them before our God day and night. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their teſtimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. Rev. xii. 10, 11. In this way the power of the devil was deſtroyed in the old Roman empire. And when Satan ſhall be bound, ſo as not to deceive the nations any more, the proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecy ſays, I ſaw thrones, and they ſat upon them, and judgment was given unto them; and I ſaw the ſouls of them that were beheaded for the witneſs of Jeſus, and for the word of God, and which had not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the beaſt, neither his image, neither had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand years. But the reſt of the dead lived not again until the thouſand years were finiſhed. This is the firſt reſurrection. Rev. xx. 4, 5. And is not this the ſame reſurrection which is ſpoken of in the eleventh chapter? For the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, according to each of theſe prophecies. And
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:030011_0327_0FE3C2846EE5E3D0"/>Daniel ſays, The ſaints of the Moſt High ſhall take the kingdom, and poſſeſs the kingdom forever, even forever and ever. Dan. vii. 18. And the raiſing of the ſouls of the old martyrs, appears to mean the ſame as the coming of John in the ſpirit and power of Elijah. Mal. iv. 5, 6. Luke i. 17. Neither have we any more reaſon to think, that the bodies of all the ſaints will be raiſed, before their reign with Chriſt a thouſand years, than the Jews had to expect that Elijah would perſonally come down from heaven, before the Meſſiah appeared among them. And as all men are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, until they are made alive to God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, and yet they have ever aſſumed the place of lawgivers and judges for the church of Chriſt, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that when God ſays, The reſt of the dead lived not again until the thouſand years were finiſhed, he means that they ſhall not have the power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over the church, as they have ever had ſince the riſe of antichriſt. For as Chriſt is the only Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of his church, how much like Sodom are all men who aſſume any power of government over her in religious affairs, ſo as to hinder her from obeying him as a chaſte virgin! There were ſome miniſters of the devil, who transformed themſelves as the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters of righteouſneſs, in the apoſtolic age, whoſe end was according to their works. 2 Cor. xi. 2—15. And we may well conclude that there are many ſuch in our day; and how pernicious is their influence among all people who receive them! And ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch with the ſword, is uſing of it to uphold the kingdom of the devil. Nevertheleſs, the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt, depart from iniquity.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. We readily grant, that no prophecy of ſcripture was ever clearly underſtood by men, until the event explained it. The diſciples of Chriſt
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:030011_0328_0FE3C28999BD85F8"/>knew not the ſcriptures that he was to riſe again from the dead, until he appeared to them, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the prophecies concerning it. Luke xxiv. 25—27. John xx. 9. And how long was it before they were clearly convinced that circumciſion was aboliſhed? And it is moſt evident that all national churches have ſprung from an abuſe of the covenant of circumciſion. That covenant gave Iſrael a right to ſeize upon the lands of the heathen in Canaan, and to buy others for ſervants; and all the planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that have been made in America, under the name of Chriſtianity, have been made by thoſe who imagined that Chriſtians had a right to deal thus with all heathens. But as our Lord hath expreſsly excluded ſlavery, and the uſe of the ſword of the magiſtrate from the government of his church, we may know that all theſe things belong to myſtery Babylon. Literal Babylon had her name from Babel, where they ſaid, Let us build us a city and a tower whoſe top may reach unto heaven, and let us make us a name, leſt we be ſcattered abroad upon the face of all the earth. Gen. xi. 4. And is not the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of all men naturally, to get to heaven by their own doings, and to make themſelves a name upon the earth? Babel ſignifies <hi>confuſion;</hi> and an inſpired apoſtle ſays, Where envying and ſtrife is, there is <hi>confuſion,</hi> and every evil work. But the wiſdom that is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocriſy. James iii. 16, 17. And no men have this wiſdom, but they who are born again by the Spirit of God. And to ſuch another apoſtle ſays, We have not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed cunningly deviſed fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but were eye-witneſſes of his majeſty. For he received from God the Father, honour and glory, when there came ſuch a voice to him from
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:030011_0329_0FE3C28CEA0C82D8"/>the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed. And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount. We have alſo a more ſure word of prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts; knowing this firſt, that no prophecy of the ſcripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt. But there were falſe prophets alſo among the people, even as there ſhall be falſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers among you, who privily ſhall bring in damnable hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction. And many ſhall follow their pernicious ways, by reaſon of whom the way of truth ſhall be evil ſpoken of. And through covetouſneſs, ſhall they with feigned words make merchandize of you; whoſe judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſlumbereth not. 2 Peter i. 16—21. ii. 1—3. And how clearly are our times here deſcribed! For the fleets and armies which have filled the world with confuſion and ſlavery, have been raiſed and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by national churches; and their vaſt funds of money, which are daily bought and ſold by deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men to enrich themſelves, have been kept in credit by the labours of the faithful. Thus, God ſays, ſhall they make merchandize of you. And if it had not been for this wicked conduct our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional debt might all have been paid off before now. But inſtead of it the debt is daily increaſing, and many have tried all their arts to draw America into another war with foreign nations. Though when the church of Chriſt ſhall be wholly governed by his laws, above all the powers of the world, Nation
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:030011_0330_0FE3C2928EDEC728"/>ſhall not lift up ſword againſt nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more. Iſaiah ii. 1—4.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. But, inſtead of ſuch a bleſſing, more blood hath been ſhed in latter ages, by the nations who have borne the name of Chriſtianity, than by all other nations in the world; and this is now loudly proclaimed in Europe and America, as a ſtrong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt divine revelation. Whereas we have juſt ſeen that damnable hereſies will cauſe the way of truth to be evil ſpoken of. The light of revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath ever enlarged the capacities of men, beyond any other means in the world; but they who have not received the word into an <hi>honeſt and good heart,</hi> have been hardened afterwards like a rock, or have been as ſharp as thorns, to tare away the property, or to deſtroy the lives of others. Luke viii. 4—15. But that which beareth thorns and briers is reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and is nigh unto curſing, whoſe end is to be burned. Heb. vi. 8. Yet many teachers now bring this laſt paſſage, to prove that the true children of God may fall away and periſh forever; while others are holding up hell as a purging fire, which will finally purge away all ſin from every child of Adam; as if the ſufferings of a creature could purge away ſin, inſtead of the blood of Chriſt applied by the Spirit of God. Thus they crucify to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame. His perſon was crucified between two thieves, and his cauſe is crucified between oppoſite teachers and profeſſors. But our Lord ſays, Enter ye in at the ſtrait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to deſtruction, and many there be who go in thereat; becauſe ſtrait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. Matt. vii. 13, 14. Though the world is full of men who deny this, and who bring in damnable <hi>hereſies.</hi> And they have perverted this word ſo much, as often to turn it againſt all thoſe
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:030011_0331_0FE3C29746751380"/>who have withdrawn from worldly churches, while others have applied the word to doctrines rather than practice. But if we take our ideas from the word of God, and not from the traditions of men, we may find that hereſy means <hi>rebellion</hi> againſt God in his church. For when the Jews accuſed Paul of ſedition, and being a leader of a new ſect, he denied the charge, and ſaid. After the way which they call hereſy, ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets. Acts xxiv. 5, 14. They accuſed him of rebellion againſt government, and of being the leader of a new ſect, who preferred Jeſus of Nazareth above Moſes, the great lawgiver to Iſrael. This laſt charge he owns, and ſo was a firm believer in revelation, while they rejected the counſel of God againſt themſelves. And each heretic is ſubverted, and ſinneth, being condemned of himſelf. Titus iii. 10, 11. For our Lord ſays, All things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them; for this is the law and the prophets. And each profeſſor who breaks this law of equity, and will not repent, is to be rejected by the church. And when ſuch men form other communities, with other laws than the laws of Chriſt, it is a way which tries the hearts of all. Therefore the voice of inſpiration ſays, If any man ſeem to be contentious, we have no ſuch cuſtom, neither the churches of God. Now in this that I declare unto you, I praiſe you not, that you come together not for the better, but for the worſe. For firſt of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be diviſions among you, and I partly believe it. For there muſt alſo be hereſies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifeſt among you. 1 Cor. xi. 16—19. Hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, ſtrife, ſeditions and hereſies, are all works of the fleſh. Gal. v. 20.
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:030011_0332_0FE3C29C2A968EB0"/>Now in all theſe paſſages, hereſy appears to mean rebellion againſt God in his church. And another apoſtle ſays of them who loved the world above God, They went out from us; but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us; but they went out, that they might be made manifeſt, that they were not all of us. And this is the ſpirit of antichriſt. 1 John ii. 15—19. All religious communities wherein the love of the world prevails above the love of God, are chargeable with damnable hereſies.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. In monarchical governments the power is in a few hands, but in America all power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is derived from the people, who have a fair opportunity to know teachers by their fruits. And where is the man who cannot diſtinguiſh thorns and brambles from trees which bear good fruit? Luke vi. 44, 45. Our Lord here plainly refers us to a parable concerning the firſt man who ſet himſelf up as king of the church of Iſrael, when God was their only king. All the good trees refuſed any ſuch power over other trees, but the bramble ſaid, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your truſt in my ſhadow; and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon. Judges ix. 8—15. The tongue ſetteth on fire the courſe of nature, and it is ſet on fire of hell. James iii. 6. And ſuch men would deſtroy the beſt characters in the land, if they would not yield to their darling ſchemes. But no man ſhould ever be elected into office, who hath not been found to be a good tree by his fruits in private ſtations; and all teachers ſhould be avoided, as wolves in ſheep's clothing, who tare away the property of any unjuſtly. And it is impoſſible for any community to be clear of this evil, where religious teachers are ſupported by force. For as the church of Iſrael were never allowed to do it, when they came into that
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:030011_0333_0FE3BB41EE2FFD68"/>practice, God ſaid, Her princes within her are roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lions, her judges are evening wolves, they gnaw not the bones till the morrow. Her prophets are light and treacherous perſons, her prieſts have pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted the ſanctuary, they have done violence to the law. Zeph. iii. 3, 4. And all the natural lions and wolves in the world, never deſtroyed ſo many men, as national churches have done in our day. Again it was ſaid of Iſrael, The heads thereof judge for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the prieſts thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money; yet will they lean upon the Lord, and ſay, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us. But for theſe iniquities their nation was ruined, and the mountain of the houſe of God will be exalted above all earthly powers, when wars ſhall come to an end. Micah iii. 11, 12. iv. 1—5. Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us, was the language which brought ruin upon Jeruſalem, and ſuch confidence in negatives will ruin all people who build thereon. For reaſon as well as ſcripture diſcovers, that the more light men have, the greater is their guilt and miſery if they ſin againſt it. But when the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of the Lord ſhall cover the earth as the waters cover the ſea, the wolf ſhall dwell with the lamb, and they ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all his holy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Iſaiah xi. 6—9. And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent. John xvii. 3. This is the only way of peace and eternal happineſs.</p>
