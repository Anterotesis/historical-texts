            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

upon the Heath, where many came drowned in Tears to take a last Farewel. The Remainder of the Evening I spent most comfortably with several of my Brethren, and went to Bed about 12 o'Clock.—I hope, in some Measure, thankful for the great Things we had seen and heard.</p>

Went in the Morning to <hi>Blendon,</hi> five Miles from <hi>Blackheath,</hi> and enjoy'd a sweet Retreat at the House of Mr. <hi>Delamot.</hi>—Preached with unusual Power at <hi>Bexley Common,</hi> at 11 in the Morning, to about 300 People, and in the Evening, near <hi>Woolwich,</hi> to several Thousands—My Word, I believe, came with the Demonstration of the Spirit. I return'd to <hi>Blendon</hi> rejoicing, and spent the Evening most delightfully with many dear Christian Friends, who came from <hi>London</hi> to see me. <hi>Oh! how does their sweet Company cause me to long for Communion amongst the Spirits of just Men made perfect! Accomplish, O LORD, I beseech thee, the Number of thine Elect, and hasten thy Kingdom.</hi>

About 10 in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, read Prayers and preached at <hi>Bexley</hi> Church,

After Sermon I went to the <hi>Green Man,</hi> near the Place where I preached, and continued till Midnight instant in Prayer, Praise and Thanksgiving, and Christian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.—I believe there were near 50 or 60 of us in all.—Great Decency and much Devotion was to be seen.—Numbers stood by as Spectators.

                  <p>Many of them watched unto Prayer and Praise all Night. I think it every Christian's Duty to be particularly careful to honour and glorify GOD in Places where he is most disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd. Some can sing the Songs of the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard in Publick Houses; Others can spend whole Nights in Chambering and Wantonness, why should Christian be ashamed to sing the Songs of the Lamb, and spend Nights, as their LORD did before them, in Exercises of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion?</p>

Preached with much Power in <hi>Bexley</hi> Church, and helped to administer to near 300 Communicants, most of which came from <hi>London.</hi>—Baptiz'd a Person of 28 Years of Age, whom GOD had work'd upon by my Ministry. Din'd at <hi>Blendon,</hi> and took sweet Counsel with many Christian Friends. Preached to above 20000 People at <hi>Blackheath,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards sup'd again at the <hi>Green Man.</hi> There were near 300 in the Room. GOD was pleased to give me extraordinary Assistance in exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Prayer, which I continued till Eleven o'Clock, and then retired to Bed, much pleas'd to think Religion, which had long been sculk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Corners, and was almost laugh'd out of the World, should now begin to appear abroad, and openly shew herself at Noon-Day. <hi>Let them count us Vain-glorious for thus confessing</hi> CHRIST <hi>before Men. It is a small Thing with us to be

About 12 we got thither, and perceived that Providence had sent us most opportunely to a Family, some of whom being born after the Spirit, are, for that Reason, most violently opposed and persecuted
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004633_0007_100DB26CCC3C6688"/>
by those Foes of their own Houshold, who are only born after the Flesh. A Clergyman has been employed to divert them from their present Madness, as they call it; and has done them the Honour of Preaching against them.—For this Week past, they have been continually beset with Numbers of such, who are Lovers of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure more than Lovers of GOD, and who would tell them, that a decent, genteel and fashionable Religion, is sufficient to carry them to Heaven. They knew nothing of my paying them this Visit, which made them more thankful.—No one can tell what a comfortable Meeting GOD gave us.—Surely it was Heaven begun upon Earth.—We found the Sweets of Opposition, and rejoiced greatly in the Prospect of suffering for CHRIST's Sake. To encrease our Satisfaction Mr. <hi>Delamot,</hi> a Convert of Mr. <hi>Ingham'</hi>s, came from <hi>Cambridge</hi> to meet us.—He is scandalously opposed at that University.—The Students make him a Proverb of Reproach, and abuse him in the rudest Manner.—He has been forbid coming in to one College, and two or three that associate with him have been threatned much by their Tutors for keeping him Company. And here I cannot but remark what wonderful Mercies GOD has shewn this Mr. <hi>Delamot'</hi>s Family.—About three or four Years ago, GOD was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to touch the Heart of his Brother <hi>Charles,</hi> who hearing that Mr. <hi>Wesley</hi> was going to <hi>Georgia</hi> (tho' his Father would have settled him in a very handsome Way) offered to go Abroad with him as a Servant.—His Parents Consent
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004633_0008_100DB270016DD458"/>
was asked, but they, and almost all their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, opposed it strenuously. However, the young Man being resolute, and convinced that GOD called him, at length they somewhat consented. He went abroad, lived with Mr. <hi>Wesley,</hi> served under him as a Son in the Gospel, did much good, and endured great Hardships for the Sake of JESUS CHRIST. Behold, how GOD rewarded him for leaving all. Whilst he was absent, GOD was pleased to make Use of the Ministry of Mr. <hi>Ingham,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Charles Wesley,</hi> in converting his Mother, two Sisters, and this young Gentlemen before-mentioned at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who, I pray GOD, may stand as a Barrier against the Prophaneness, Debauchery, Lukewarmness and Deism of that Seat of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and prove both a <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Boanerges</hi> in the Church of <hi>England!</hi> But to return,—After having spent some comfortable Hours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, we went to <hi>Wimbish Green,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Charles Wesley</hi> had preached some Time ago. I rode thither in a Chaise, and preached from it to about 400 People, with great Freedom and Power. About 9 we returned to <hi>Broad-oaks,</hi> and spent the most heavenly Night I have known for a long While. Oh! how doubly sweet are Opportunities when we have been debarred of them for some Time! I believe the Saints of old had never so much Comfort, as when they were obliged to shut the Doors for Fear of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to hide themselves in Dens and Cave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

After Sermon, Mr. <hi>S—g,</hi> kindly entertained me, and my Fellow-Travellers, and many others that came to hear me.—We spent our Time most Christianly together, and afterwards went to <hi>Bishop-stortford,</hi> about 12 Miles from <hi>Thaxted;</hi> where I promised, GOD willing, to preach as to-Night. About five we got thither, and at six, GOD enabled me to preach with Power to near 4000 People. Many devout Souls were present, and several

Invitations were given me in the Name of CHRIST, to other Parts of <hi>Essex,</hi> which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to do, supposing the Embargo on the Shipping continued. <hi>Blessed be GOD, this itinerant Preaching brings me acquainted with Numbers of his Children, which otherwise I might never have seen or heard of in this Life.

but the Diocesan had been pleased to insist on the Vicar's denying me the Pulpit. Whether for just Cause GOD shall judge at the last Day. If we have done any Thing worthy the Censures of the Church, why do not the Right Reverend the Bishops call us to a publick Account? If not, why do they not confess and own us? It is well we can appeal to the great Bishop of Souls. They say, it is not regular our going out into the Highways and Hedges, and compelling poor Sinners to come in. We ought not <hi>so</hi> to beseech them to be reconciled to GOD. They desire to know by what Authority we preach; and ask, what Sign shewest thou that thou dost these Things? But, alas! what further Sign would they require? We went not into the Fields till we were excluded the Churches: And has not GOD set his Seal to our Ministry in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Manner? Have not many that were spiritually Blind received their Sight? Many that have been Lame strengthened to run the Way of GOD's Commandments? Have not the Deaf heard? The Lepers been cleansed? The Dead raised? And the Poor had the Gospel preached unto them? That these notable Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles have been wrought, not in our own Names, or by our own Power, but in the Name and by the Power of JESUS of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> cannot be denied. And yet they require a Sign? <hi>But verily there shall no other Sign be given to this evil and adulterous Generation!</hi>

Breakfasted at <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and preached at 11 in the Morning, read Prayers in the Afternoon, and preached again in the Afternoon at <hi>Randwick</hi> Church, about 7 Miles from <hi>Gloucester.</hi> The Church was quite full, about 2000 were in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, who, by taking down the Window that lay behind the Pulpit, had the Conveniency of Hearing. Many wept sorely.</p>
                  <p>After Evening Service I hasten'd to <hi>Hampton-Common,</hi> and to my great Surprize, sound no less than 20000 on Horseback and Foot ready to hear me. New Strength was imparted to me from abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Opposition had been made by the Bailiff against my coming. Upon my Entrance into the Town, I found the People much alarmed, and as soon as I was got into the Inn, four Constables came to attend me: But a Lawyer being there who was my Friend, he demanded the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble's Warrant, who being not able to produce one, he sent them about their Business. At eight o'Clock I went into a Field lent me by one Mr. <hi>H—ds,</hi> which lay without the Liberties of the Town. My Audience consisted of 2 or 3000 People. I spoke with Freedom, and most, as I afterwards heard, went satisfied and affected away. The Remainder of the Evening I spent most agreeably with many Christian Friends who accompanied me on my Journey. I perceived a fresh supply of Spirits to be given me from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, <hi>and rejoiced that</hi> GOD <hi>leads me on from conquering to conquer.</hi>

Waited this Morning upon Mr. <hi>J—s,</hi> one of the Town-Bailiffs, and asked him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Meekness, <q>For what Reason he sent the Constables after me?</q> He said, <q>It was the Determination not of himself, but of all the Council.</q> He then said, <q>The People were noisy, and reflected upon the Bailiffs.</q> I answered, <q>that was owing to their sending the Constables with their Staves to apprehend me, when I should come into Town.</q> Upon this he began to be a little angry, and told me, <q>A certain Judge said, he would take me up
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004633_0012_100DB279157DEC30"/>
as a Vagrant, was I to preach near him.</q> I answered, <q>he was very welcome to do as he pleased. But I apprehended no Magistrate had Power to stop my Preaching, even in the Streets, if I thought proper.</q> 
                     <q>No, Sir, says he, if you preach here Tomorrow, you shall have the Constables to attend you.</q>—After this I took my Leave, telling him, <q>I thought it my Duty as a Minister to inform him, that Magistrates were intended to be a Terror to evil Doers, and not to those who do well. And I desired, he would be as careful to appoint Constables to attend at the next Horse Race, Balls and Assemblies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>About nine in the Morning we left <hi>Tweksbury,</hi> and reached <hi>Evesham</hi> about Noon.—The poor People were much alarmed, hearing I had been abused at <hi>Tweksbury.</hi> And the Magistrates of <hi>Evesham</hi> had threatned to apprehend me if I preached within their Liberties. Upon this, Mr. <hi>Benjamin Seward</hi> thought it adviseable to preach near his House, which I did from a Wall to near 1000 Hearers, and, I believe, to good Effect.—At my Return to the Inn, I could not but observe to my Friends how gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Opposition increased. At present, it seems to be like the Cloud which <hi>Elijah'</hi>s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant saw; no bigger than a Man's Hand; but, by and by, it will gather apace, and break upon the Church of GOD. <hi>But the</hi> GOD <hi>whom we serve is able to deliver us.</hi>

About 8 at Night I preached again from the same Place; but had the Satisfaction of seeing my Morning Congregation trebly increased: After this I went to a Friend's House to eat Bread; and came to my Inn, wishing that all felt the Love of GOD shed abroad in their Hearts, as I did then.</p>

About five in the Evening I took an affectionate Leave of <hi>Evesham.</hi> Friends, and in Company with about 120 on Horseback went to <hi>Tweksbury,</hi> and never saw a Town so much alarmed. The Streets were crowded with People from all Parts. I rode im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately thro' the Town, preached to about 6000 Hearers in a Field lent us by Mr. P—, but saw no Constables that came either to molest or attend on me. <hi>My hour is not yet come—By and

                  <p>Immediately after Sermon I took Horse, and reached <hi>Gloucester</hi> near Midnight. The Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was very pleasant.

And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently your Lordship equally offends when you preach out of your own Diocese. As for inveighing against the Clergy (without a Cause) I deny the Charge. What I say I am ready to make good when ever your Lordship pleases. Let those that bring Reports to your Lordship about my Preaching, be brought Face to Face, I am ready to give them an Answer.

For to me, he seems to know no more of the true Nature of Regeneration, than <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did, when he came to JESUS by Night.—Your Lordship may observe, that he does not speak a Word of Original Sin, or the dreadful Consequences of our Fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> upon which the Doctrine of the New-Birth is entirely founded. No; like other polite Preachers, he seems to think, in the very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Discourse, that St. <hi>

Again, <hi>my Lord,</hi> the Doctor entirely mistakes us when we talk of the <hi>sensible</hi> Operations of the Holy Ghost.

But to disprove this, the Doctor brings our LORD's Allusion to the Wind in the third of St. <hi>John,</hi> which is one of the best Texts he could urge to prove it. For if the Analogy of our LORD's Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course be carried on, we shall find it amounts to thus much; That altho' the Operations of the Spirit of GOD can no more be accounted for, than how the Wind cometh and whither it goeth; yet may they be as easily felt by the Soul as the Wind may be felt by the Body.—My Lord, indeed we speak what we know. But, says the Doctor, "These Men have no Proof to offer for their <hi>inward</hi> Manifestations." What Proof, my Lord, does the Doctor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; would he have us raise dead Bodies? Have we not done greater Things than these? I speak with all Humility, has not GOD by our Ministry raised many dead Souls to a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life. Verily, if Men will not believe the Evidence GOD has given that he sent us, neither would they believe tho' one rose from the Dead. Besides, my Lord, the Doctor Charges us with Things we are entire Strangers to, such as the denying Men the Use of GOD's Creatures; Encouraging Abstinence, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Neglect of the Duties of our Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

Again, he says, I suppose Mr. <hi>Benjamin Seward</hi> to be a Person <hi>believing in</hi> CHRIST, <hi>and blameless in his Conversation,</hi> before what I call his Conversion. But this is a direct Untruth. For it was thro' the Want of a <hi>living Faith</hi> in JESUS CHRIST, which he now has, that he was not a Christian before, but a a meer Moralist. Your Lordship knows that our Article says, Works done without the Spirit of GOD, and true Faith in JESUS CHRIST have the Nature of Sin. And such were all the Works done by Mr. <hi>Benjamin Seward</hi> before the Time mentioned in my Journal. Again, my Lord, the Doctor repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents That as my Opinion concerning Quakers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in general, which I only meant of those I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with in particular.

Our LORD, I believe, will not be ashamed to <hi>confess us pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly in that Day.</hi> I pray GOD we all may approve ourselves such faithful Ministers of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> that we may be able to lift up our Heads with Boldness.

                     <hi>Tuesday, July</hi> 10. Preached Yesterday E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening at the <hi>Brick-Yard</hi> to about 8000 People. Dined to-day with my honoured Fellow-Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, Mr. <hi>Wesley,</hi> and many other Friends, at <hi>Two-Mill-Hill</hi> in <hi>Kingswood,</hi> and preached after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to several Thousand People, and Colliers, in the School-House, which has been carried on so successfully, that the Roof is ready to be put up. The Design I think is good. Old as well as young are to be instructed. A great and a visible Alteration is made in the Behaviour of the Colliers. Instead of Cursing and Swearing,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:004633_0017_100DB28596603DB0"/>
they are heard to sing Hymns about the Woods; and the rising Generation, I hope, will be a Generation of Christians. They seem much affected by the Word. They melt into Tears, and are observed to attend the Churches and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties when Mr. <hi>Wesley</hi> is absent from them. The Prospect of their future Welfare filled me with Joy unspeakable. They took a most affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate Leave of me. LORD <hi>put thou their Tears into thy Bottle!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Went immediately after Sermon was ended with Mr. <hi>Wesley,</hi> and several other Friends, to <hi>Bath,</hi> and preached there to about 3000 People at 7 in the Evening. It rained a little all the while, but the People were very patient and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Nay one, that was called to serve on the Petty-Jury, offered to submit to any Fine, rather than do any thing against us; who, he said, were true Servants of JESUS CHRIST. <hi>May he meet with that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which our LORD has promised to all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Wednesday, July</hi> 11. Preached at 11 in the Morning, to a larger Audience than last Night, and almost with equal Power. Hasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Bristol,</hi> and preached in the Evening at <hi>Baptist-Mills</hi> to a large Congregation. It rained much: <hi>But, blessed be GOD, the People's Hearts are so far influenced by the Gospel of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>that they care but little whether it rains or shines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this, my Brother <hi>Wesley</hi> and I went to the Women and Men's Societies, settled some Affairs, and united the two leading Societies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. A great Harmony and Sweetness of Soul was amongst us all. My Heart was full of Love for them, and they wept most sorely at my Farewel-Exhortation and Prayer. <hi>How can I be thankful enough to GOD, for sending me hither to see, that the Seed has been sown on good Ground; and that by the Ministry of Mr.</hi> Wesley <hi>it has received great Increase.

                     <hi>Friday, July</hi> 13. Preached my Farewel Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon at 7 in the Morning to a weeping and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected Audience. My Heart was full, and I continued near two Hours in Prayer and Preaching. The poor People shed many Tears, and sent up Thousands of Prayers in my Behalf, and would scarce let me go away. Their Mites they most chearfully contributed to the School-House at <hi>Kingswood,</hi> and proved, I think, to a Demonstration, that they had not received the Word of GOD in vain. <hi>Blessed be GOD for seeing this Increase of his Mercy. Blessed be GOD for my coming hither to behold some Fruits of my Labours.</hi> Many Souls have been strengthened and comforted, many convinced of Sin, and myself also more established and strong in the LORD. <hi>As Oppositions abound, so do my Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations much more abound! Who is so good a Master as</hi> JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>Retired after Sermon to vent my Heart, which was ready to burst with a Sense of GOD's espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, distinguishing, repeated Mercies. Dined with and took a most affectionate Leave of a whole Roomful of weeping Friends. Set out about 4 o'Clock, and reached <hi>Thornbury</hi> about 8 in the Evening. It raining exceeding hard most part of the Day, there were but few Country People.—However, I preached to about 600 from a Table in the Street. <hi>I hope GOD gave it his Blessing.</hi>

should permit. Never did I see People more eager after the <hi>Milk of the Word.</hi> Their Souls were much rejoiced when I told them Mr. <hi>John Wesley</hi> intended to come after to feed them. <hi>LORD grant he may be preferred before me wherever he goes!</hi>

                     <hi>Monday, July</hi> 16. Lay last Night at the House of Mr. <hi>E- s</hi> of <hi>Ebly,</hi> and had a most comfortable Time of it. Went to <hi>Tedbury,</hi> about six Miles from thence, having been earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invited several Times and preached at Noon to about 4000 People.—Many gracious Souls of divers Denominations came to meet me, with whom I took sweet Counsel.—The Scoffers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I came, had threatned to do something.—But the Power of GOD's Word overcame them. Visited in the Afternoon, Mr. <hi>O</hi>—, a Baptist Teacher, and went afterwards, in Company with several Friends, to <hi>Malmsbury</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> about 3 Miles from <hi>Tedbury,</hi> whither I had been invited by a Letter signed by 52 Persons. At 7 I preached to about 3000 People, who, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, felt the Power of GOD's Word. Much Opposition had been made by the <hi>Pharisees</hi> against my coming; and the Minister in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular had wrote to the Church-warden to stop me; but he was more noble. Numbers, as I heard afterwards, who were vastly prejudiced against me by lying Reports, went away convinced that I spoke the Words of Truth and Soberness. <hi>Thou shalt answer for me, O LORD my GOD.</hi>

                     <hi>Tuesday, July</hi> 17. Lay with my Fellow-Travellers at the House of Mr. <hi>Line,</hi> who most
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004633_0020_100DB28D3A91CE10"/>
gladly received us for our Master's Sake. I had a Thorn in the Flesh sent to buffet me, was weak in Body, deserted in Mind, and felt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be what I often say we all are by Nature, half a Devil, and half a Beast. With great inward Reluctance I rose and preached to about 2000 Souls at 8 in the Morning, then I retired to my Bed again, with an unspeakable Pressure upon my Heart till Noon. Was something better after Dinner, and much reviv'd to see what an effectual Door was like to be opened in <hi>Wiltshire</hi> for Preaching the Gospel. Went and paid my Respects to the chief Magistrate, who was my Friend, and reached <hi>Cirencester</hi> about six in the Evening.</p>
                  <p>Here also Men breathed out Threatnings against me, but were not impowered to put them in Execution. Numbers came from Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Towns. My Congregation was as large again as when I preached here last. GOD enabled me, weak as I was, to speak boldly, as I ought to speak. Every Thing was carried on with Decency and Order, and my inward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts began to return again. <hi>GOD will not always be chiding, neither keepeth He his Anger for ever. How heavily do I drive when GOD takes off my Chariot Wheels. O that I may learn to be meek and lowly in my own Eyes.—LORD give me Humility, or I perish.</hi>

Much Opposition had been made against my Coming.—The Landlord, whose House we offered to put up at, genteelly told us, he had not Room for us; and numberless Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices had been industriously spread to prevent my Success; but GOD strengthened me after my Journey, and enabled me to speak, I trust, to the Hearts of many. <hi>GOD's Word will make its own Way, let Men say what they please.

Perceiving myself languid and weary, I lay down upon the Bed soon after our coming into the Inn, but was soon refreshed with the News, that the Landlord, one of whose Children was wrought upon when I was there last, would not let us stay under his Roof; upon which I immediately rose and went to another Inn; but the People made a Mock of both me and my Friends as we past along, and shot out their Arrows, even bitter Words against us, and Fire-Rockets were thrown around the Door. It was now near 8 o' Clock, and too late to preach; I therefore retired from my Friends, gave GOD Thanks for accounting me worthy to suffer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach for his Name Sake, and about an Hour after received the following Letter by the Hands of the Constable from Mr. Mayor.</p>

                     <hi>Friday, July</hi> 23. After Breakfast waited in Person upon Mr. Mayor, to see what Law could be produced against my Meetings. Assoon as I began to talk with him, I perceived he was a little angry—and said, <hi>Sir, you sn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

It was your Business, Sir, said I, to wait, and if there was any Riot in my Meetings, then, and not till then, it is your Duty to interpose. Then said he, <hi>Sir, you wrote to me about the Revel to Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I then pressed him, to shew me a Law against Meetings; urging, if there had been any Law, they would have been stopped long since. He answered, <hi>It was an odd Way of preaching.—But, Sir,</hi> says he, <hi>I must go away to a Fair; before you came I had wrote you another Letter, which I will send you yet, if you please.</hi> Upon this I thanked him, paid him the Respect due to a Magistrate, and took my Leave. Soon after I was returned to my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he sent me the following Letter:</p>

You very well know there are Penal-Laws against Cursing and Swearing, and I could wish there were the same against Deceit and Hypocrisy. Your appearing against me as a swift Witness at the Day of Judgment, I must own, is a most terrible Thing, and may serve as a Bug-bear for Children, or People of weak Minds; but believe me, Reverend Sir, those Disguises will have but little Weight amongst Men of common Understanding.</p>

Leave.—As I passed by on Horseback, I saw a Stage built for the Cudgellers and Wrestlers; and as I rode farther, I met divers coming to the Revel, which affected me so much, that I had no Rest in my Spirit. And therefore having asked Counsel of GOD, and perceiving an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual Power and Warmth enter into my Soul, though I was gone above a Mile from the Town, I could not bear to see so many dear Souls for whom CHRIST died, ready to perish, and no Minister or Magistrate interpose. Upon this I told my dear Fellow Travellers that I was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to follow the Example of <hi>Howel Harris</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> and to bear my Testimony against such lying Vanities, let the Consequences, as to my own private Person, be what they would. They immediately consenting, I rode back to the Town, got upon the Stage erected for the Wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and began to shew them the Error of their Ways.—Many seemed ready to hear what I had to say, but one more zealous for his Master than the rest, and fearing Conviction every Time I so much as attempted to speak, set the Boys upon repeating their Uzza's.—My Soul, I perceived, was in a sweet Frame, willing to be offered up, so that I might save some of those, to whom I was about to speak; but all in vain. While I was on the Stage, one struck me with his Cudgel, which I received with the utmost Love; till at last finding the Devil would not permit them to give me Audience, I got off, and after much thronging and pushing me, I mounted my Horse with unspeakable Satisfaction w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

that I had now begun to attack the Devil in his strongest Holds, and had borne my Testimony against the detestable Diversions of this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Ye Masters of <hi>Israel,</hi> what are you do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?

amongst us. Scoffers and curious Persons daily drop off. Most that come now, I hope, do not come out of Curiosity. Never were Souls more melted down by the Power of GOD's Words.

This is the Sum and Substance of the Generality of our modern Doctrine. And therefore, was I to die immediately for speaking, yet I should

                        <p>O thy noble Testimony against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness and Vanity of the Age. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced me not a little. But when thou camest to the Necessity, the Nature and the Rewards of the <hi>New-Birth,</hi> the true Seed, thou wert carried beyond thyself, the Fountain of Life was opened, and flowed around amongst the Living. I am, for one, a Monument of free Grace and Mercy. <hi>O GOD how boundless it thy Love!</hi> He hath not hid his Mercies from me. I have often drank of the spiritual Rock, and been a Witness of the Joys of GOD's Salvation. Ay, those Joys, that sweet Presence of CHRIST, that carries Men above the Fear of the World, and enables them to overcome the World; that baptizeth into the Spirit and Nature of the SON OF GOD, and maketh Disciples indeed. It is a Sense of GOD ever near the Influences of his quickening Spirit, that is only able to deter from Evil, crucify the old Nature, create again to GOD, and perform his good and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Will. This will make a thorough <hi>Reformation,</hi> beginning at the Heart, sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, guarding of it, and malting it a holy Temple for the holy Spirit to dwell in, then producing holy Thoughts, Longings after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

                        <p>But, why this to thee? Thou hast drank deep of divine Love; only I know that the good Experiences of GOD's Children are often Causes of mutual Comfort. I have often been sensible of it myself, and therefore, not only thus privately, but publickly have I been strengthened to tell to others, that GOD is good, and that he has done great Things for my Soul. Ministers not thus qualified, and thus sent, may indeed be Ministers of those who sent them, but Ministers of CHRIST they cannot be.</p>

                  <p>My Friend, Mr. <hi>William Seward,</hi> received also a Letter from his Brother, in which were the following Paragraphs.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>I had a Letter <hi>per</hi> last Post from Mr.—wherein he speaks of one Mr.—of <hi>Corpus Christ College,</hi> whom his Uncle, a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, hath entirely discarded, and wrote to the College to expel him for his Methodistical Notions.</p>
                     <p>The old Clerk at <hi>Breferton,</hi> whom I before spoke of, having heard Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> at <hi>Bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Soon after this he went to Work, being a Taylor by Trade, and asking for one of these Books, the others being lent out, he said he had not read above a Page or two, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Truth broke in upon his Soul like Lightning. He said he could not go on with his Work with any Satisfaction, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

and confirmed him, that he could lay his Life down in Defence of the Truth as it is in JESUS. He says, the Gospel appears to him, as though he never read a Line in it before; and it is a greater Miracle to him, that he, an old Sinner, with one Foot in the Grave, should be called at these Years, than if he had seen the Dead raised. He always, by what I can learn, bore a fair Character, and was esteemed by his Neighbours, but now threatned with the Loss of his Bread, for coming to <hi>Badsey</hi> Society, and declaring his Testimony to the Truth of Mr. <hi>Whitefield'</hi>s Doctrine, or rather I should say, the Doctrine of the Gospel. The Books he met with are very oil, and, he says, were thrown by as waste Paper out of a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman's Library, that was sold after his Death, whereby the <hi>Contercup</hi> Man met with them, and they seemed very providentially reserved for his Use.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Persons wonder at me, because I talk of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, now the World is become Christian; but alas! was JESUS CHRIST to come down from Heaven at this Time, he would he treated as formerly. And whoever goes forth to preach the Gospel in his Spirit, must expect the same Treatment as his first Apostles met with. <hi>LORD, prepare us for all Events.</hi>

Thousands at the great Day will have Reason to bless GOD for Field-Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

of the Success of our Doctrine. By the Help of GOD I will still go on to attack the Devil in his strongest Holds. The common People go to these Diversions for Want of knowing better.

in the Evening, where 20 <hi>l.</hi> was collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. GOD sent us a little Rain; but that only washed away the curious Hearers.—Near thirty Thousand stood their Ground, and GOD, I believe, watered them with the Dew of his heavenly Blessing.

Thousands and I believe ten Thousands, come constantly to hear. Scoffers seem afraid to shew their Heads, being frequently overpowered by GOD's Word.

If you are found faithful, you must undergo a strong Persecution. A Person in Power told me, nothing but the Fear of Strengthening my Interest. kept off the Storm. But the Enmity of the natural Man is so great against GOD, that if the Good Work, which is begun is carried on, it will soon break through all Restraints, though thereby our Enemies will confound themselves; but the Scriptures must be fulfilled. Oh arm People against a Suffering Time; exhort them always to be obedient to the higher Powers; remind them again and again, that our Kingdom is not of this World, and that it does not become Christians to resist the Powers that are ordained of GOD, but pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to suffer for the Truth's Sake.

a Coach to <hi>Lewisham,</hi> where an hospitable Entertainment was prepared for me and my Friends.—Their Company was sweet to my Soul; but my Body being Weak, and GOD being pleased to visit me with some inward Trials, I retired to Bed with a deeper Sense of my own Vileness, than I have felt for some Time. <hi>LORD increase it for thy Mercies sake!</hi>

                           </hi> Many have <hi>One,</hi> who never attain to the <hi>Other.</hi> Many have good Desires to subdue Sin, and yet resting in those good Desires, Sin has always had Dominion over them. A Person sick of a Fever may desire to be in Health, but that Desire is not Health itself. In like Manner many have good Dispositions or Desires to be good, but that is not Goodness itself. And consequently Men need more Evidence than good Dispositions, to prove to themselves or others, <hi>That the Holy Spirit of GOD co-operates with their honest En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to subdue Sin.</hi> If by good Dispositions Your Lordship means good Habits wrought in the Heart by the Spirit of GOD, such as <hi>Peace, Love, Joy, Long-suffering, Goodness, Truth,</hi> &amp;c. I then agree a Man needs no other Evidence. For these are the proper and genuine Fruits of the Spirit itself.</p>
                        <p>Your Lordship immediately adds, <hi>Nor that, persevering in their Course, and praying to GOD for his Assistance, and relying upon the Merits of</hi> CHRIST <hi>for the Pardon of all such Sins, Failings, and Imperfections as are more or less unavoidable in this mortal State.</hi> I beg Leave to ask your Lordship, whether this does not savour too much of the common Divinity, <abbr>

do something for ourselves; or, in other Words, that we have partly a Righteousness of our own, and that JESUS CHRIST is to MAKE UP the Deficiencies of that Righteousness? What else can your Lordship mean, by saying, <hi>That we must rely on the Merits of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>for the Pardon of all such Sins as are more or less unavoidable in this mortal State?'</hi> Did JESUS CHRIST come into the World, my Lord, only to save us from the Guilt of such Sins as are more or less una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable in this mortal State? The Scriptures every where affirm, <hi>That Man hath no Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of his own: That there is none Righteous, no not one: That all our Righteousness is as filthy Rags;</hi> and that JESUS CHRIST died not only to save us from the Guilt of all such Sins, Failings and Infirmities, as are more or less unavoidable in this mortal State, but from all wilful Sins, and also from that original Corruption, which every Man naturally engendred of the Off-spring of <hi>Adam,</hi> brings into the World with him. I hope I have not misunderstood or overstrained Your Lordship's Expression.</p>
                        <p>I come now to Your Lordship's Caution against <hi>Enthusiasm.</hi> For that I suppose Your Lordship<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> intended more particularly against me.</p>
                        <p>And here, my Lord, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>eg Leave to observe, That in my Opinion, your Lordship has by no Means been clear enough in your Definition of the Word <hi>Enthusiasm.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>According to the fair Rules of Writing, was it not first incumbent on your Lordship to shew, that the Word <hi>Enthusiast</hi> had a good as well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

bad Meaning? that it signifies no more than <hi>a Person in GOD,</hi> and consequently every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, in the proper Sense of the Word, is an <hi>Enthusiast?</hi> For St. <hi>Peter</hi> writes, <hi>That to us are given exceeding great and precious Promises, that by these we might be Partakers of the Divine Nature.</hi> And our Church says, If we receive the Sacrament worthily, we are one with CHRIST and CHRIST with us, we dwell in CHRIST and CHRIST in us. For which she has sufficient Warrant from our LORD'S Prayer, John 17. 20. <hi>Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through their Word.</hi> Ver. 21. <hi>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.</hi> Ver. 23. <hi>I in them and they in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</hi> Ver. 26. <hi>That the Love wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them and I in them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But indeed your Lordship's Definition of <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> when examined, does not convey any ill Idea at all. <q>
                              <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> is a strong Persuasion on the Mind, that they are guided in an extraordinary Manner, by immediate Impulses and Impressions of the Spirit of GOD.</q> Had Your Lordship said, a strong, but groundless Persuasion, that they are guided in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Manner, it would have been to your Lordship's Purpose. But to affirm without any Restriction, that a strong Persuasion that we are guided in an extraordinary Manner by immediate Impulses, is <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> in the worst Sense of the
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:004633_0039_100DB2B7E9C49C98"/>
Word, when your Lordship yourself says, (<hi>p.</hi> 54) <q>There is no Doubt but GOD, when he pleases, can work upon the Minds of Men by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Influences,</q> to me seems a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent.</p>
                        <p>Your Lordship proceeds thus: <q>And this is owing chiefly to the Want of distinguishing aright between the ordinary and extraordinary Operations of the Holy Spirit. The extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Operations were those by which the Apostles and Others, who were entrusted with the first Propagation of the Gospel, were ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to work Miracles, and speak with Tongues, in Testimony, that their Mission and Doctrine were from GOD.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>I suppose, by extraordinary Operations, Your Lordship means the same as being guided in an extraordinary Manner just above. And if so, according to your Lordship's own Definition, I am no <hi>Enthusiast.</hi> For I never did pretend to these extraordinary Operations of working Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles or speaking with Tongues, in Testimony that my Mission and Doctrine were from GOD; I only lay Claim to the ordinary Gifts and Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit, which your Lordship (<hi>pag.</hi> 20) says, <hi>'still continue.'</hi> And what Need was there then, my Lord, that the People of your Diocese should be cautioned against <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> on my Account?</p>
                        <p>But your Lordship farther adds, <q>the ordinary Gifts, however real and certain in themselves, are no otherwise discernable than by their Fruits and Effects.</q> Had your Lordship said,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:004633_0039_100DB2B7E9C49C98"/>
no otherwise discernible to others than by their Fruits and Effects, it would have been right. But if your Lordship means they are no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise discernible to ourselves, in my Opinion it is wrong: For it is possible, my Lord, for a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to feel and discern these ordinary Gifts and Influences of the Spirit in himself, when there is no Opportunity of discovering them to others. For Instance, on Supposition that your Lordship was assisted by the blessed Spirit in writing your Pastoral Letter,—might not your Lordship be sensible of an inward Joy and Complacency, wrought by that self same Spirit, which was not then discernible to others? So likewise it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for another to feel Joy in the Holy Ghost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the rest of his Fruits, which at that Time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may not be discernible to others; and which they who have never experienced the like may not believe, though a Man declare it unto them. I hope, my Lord, these Reasonings carry with them their own Evidence.</p>
                        <p>But to proceed (<hi>Pag.</hi> 20,21,22,23,24,25).

such Suggestions made by me; indeed your Lordship does not do me Justice. As your Lordship, I find, has done me the Honour to peruse my third Journal, your Lordship may remember this Observation (<hi>Page</hi> 206) that, after I had baptized an Adult, I proved the Necessity of the New-Birth, from the Office of our Church.</p>
                        <p>In my Sermon upon the <hi>Indwelling of the Spirit of GOD,</hi> which I have made bold to send your Lordship with this Letter, you will find I have quoted the Expressions of our own Church Offices, to prove the Doctrine of the New-Birth, as your Lordship does in your Pastoral Letter. My constant Way of Preaching is, first, to prove my Propositions by Scripture, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate them by the Articles and Collects of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> Those that have heard me, can witness, how often I have exhorted them to be constant at the publick Service of the Church. I attend on it myself, and would read the public Liturgy every Day, if your Lordship's Clergy would give me Leave. What further Satisfaction can your Lordship require, that I do not suggest to your Lordship's People, <q>as if our Church were regardless of the Doctrine of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and New-Birth, and as if there were Need for any Member of it, to seek elsewhere for a more spiritual Service?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the following Paragraph, your Lordship has the same Insinuation, as though I wanted to introduce Extempore Prayer, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> to lay aside the publick Liturgy of our Church. For after your Lordship had been speaking against Praying by
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:004633_0040_100DB2B9C12E69F8"/>
the Spirit, and affirming that the Scripture no where tells us, that Prayer is the single Work of the Spirit your Lordship says to your People, <hi>You have great Reason to be thankful to God for a publick Service prepared to your Hands.</hi> My Lord, I never said to the Contrary. But does not your Lordship seem to insinuate at the same Time, that we are not to depend on the Spirit of GOD to enable us to pray Extempore, either in public or private? That Prayer is not the single Work of the Spirit, without any Co-operation of our own, I readily confess. But that the Spirit of GOD does assist true Christians to pray extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore now, as well as formerly, is undeniable if the Scriptures be true. For what says the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle? <hi>We know not what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself helpeth our Infirmities, and maketh Intercession for us with Groanings that cannot be uttered.</hi> And this is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>I take it for granted, that I am one of those Men whom your Lordship thinks should be
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:004633_0042_100DB2BE7A82E5A8"/>
called upon for some reasonable Evidence of a Divine Commission.</p>
                        <p>But, my Lord, what reasonable Evidence does your Lordship require? Did I not receive Letters dimissory from your Lordship's own Hands to be ordained Priest? Did I not, when ordained Deacon affirm, <hi>That I was inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost, to take upon me that Office and Ministration?</hi> Did not my Lord of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> when he ordained me Priest, say unto me, <hi>Receive thou the Holy Ghost, now committed unto thee by the Imposition of our Hands, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost?</hi> And is not this, my Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a reasonable Evidence that I act by a Divine Commission? If this be not true, must not all those whom your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or the other Bishops ordain, act only by a human Commission? Nay (to use the Words of Bishop <hi>Burnet</hi> in his Pastoral Letter) <hi>Must not they who are ordained, Lie, not only unto Man but unto GOD, by saying, They are inwardly moved by the Holy Spirit?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If your Lordship in any wise disputes my acting by a Divine Commission, you disclaim your own Divine Right and Authority; nor can you possibly avoid the Dilemma, of either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing my Divine Commission, or denying your own.</p>
                        <p>After Your Lordship has insinuated a Demand for the Evidences of my Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, immediately follows these Words, <hi>When they tell us of extraordinary Communications they have with GOD.</hi>

If by extraordinary Communications, your Lordship means the extraordinary Operations of the Holy Spirit, as Working Miracles, and Speaking with Tongues; your Lordship may assure yourself, I never pretend to any such Thing.—If, by extraordinary Communications, your Lordship means more Assistances and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts from GOD at some Times than I have at others (which is all I mean by extraordinary Communications) I own the Charge. And what is there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Lord, extraordinary in that?</p>
                        <p>Again, Your Lordship says (<hi>Page</hi> 28) <hi>When they talk in the Language of those who have a special and immediate Mission from GOD.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And does your Lordship, and the rest of the Bishops, ordain any, without obliging them first to give good Proofs, that they have a special Call or immediate Mission from GOD to the Work of the Ministry? If ever you so do, my Lord, doth not your Lordship lay Hands too suddenly upon Men?</p>
                        <p>(<hi>Page</hi> 29) Your Lordship writes thus.—<hi>When they profess to think and act under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Guidance of a Divine Inspiration.</hi>

                        <p>And does not your Lordship think and act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the same Rule? Why otherwise does your Lordship pray, when you administer the Holy Communion, <hi>that GOD would cleanse the Thoughts of our Hearts by the Inspiration of his Holy Spirit.</hi>

                        <p>'Tis true, my Lord, in one Sense, mine is a New Gospel, and always will be unknown to the Generality of Ministers and People, even in a Christian Country, if your Lordship's Clergy follow your Lordship's Directions. For what says your Lordship (Page 46) <hi>I hope that when Ministers preach to you of Justification by Faith
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:004633_0044_100DB2C293829548"/>
alone, which is asserted in the strongest Manner by our Church, they explain it in such a Manner as to leave no Doubt upon your Mind, whether good Works are a necessary Condition of your being justified in the Sight of GOD.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But pray, my Lord, where has the Scripture made good Works a necessary Condition of our being justified in the Sight of GOD? St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>By Grace ye are saved, thro' Faith, not of Works, and that lost any Man should boast; for Eternal Life is the Gift of GOD through</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>our LORD.</hi> Your Lordship exhorts your Clergy to preach Justification by Faith alone, and quotes the 11th Article of our Church, which tells us, <hi>we are justified by Faith only, and not for our own Works or Deservings.</hi>
                           <note n="*" place="bottom">
                              <hi>See the</hi> 11<hi>th,</hi> 12<hi>th and</hi> 13<hi>th Articles of our Church.</hi>
                           </note> At the same Time your Lordship bids them, <hi>explain it in such a Manner as to leave no Doubt upon their Minds, whether good Works are a necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their being justified in the Sight of GOD,</hi> Your Lordship, in my Opinion, could not well be guilty of a greater Inconsistency. This, my Lord, is truly a New Gospel. I am sure it is not what the Apostles preached; and it is as contrary to the Doctrine of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and the whole Tenor of the Gospel, as Darkness is contrary to Light. Had your Lordship insisted on your Clergy's preaching up good Works <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> a necessary Fruit and Consequence, instead of a necessary Condition of our being justified, your Lordship would have used your Authority aright.
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:004633_0044_100DB2C293829548"/>
For we are commanded to shew forth or declare to others, that we have a True Faith by our Works. And the 12th Article of our Church says, <hi>that good Works follow after Justification;</hi> and how then, my Lord, are they <hi>a necessary Condition of our Justification?</hi> No, my Lord, Salvation (if the Gospel be true) is the free Gift of GOD through JESUS CHRIST. Faith is the Means whereby that Salvation is applied to our Hearts, and good Works are the necessary Fruits and Proof of that Faith.</p>
                        <p>This, my Lord, is the Doctrine of JESUS CHRIST, this is the Doctrine of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and it is because the Generality of the Clergy of the <hi>Church of England</hi> do not preach this Doctrine, that I am resolved, GOD being my Helper, to continue instant in Season and out of Season, to declare <hi>IT</hi> unto all Men, let the Consequences, as to my own private Person, be what they will.</p>
                        <p>As for your Lordship's blaming me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

(<hi>Page</hi> 50) (For your Lordship's Sake I would not mention them) I hope my Life and Doctrine—will always prove them to be groundless.</p>

                     <hi>Wednesday, August</hi> 15. Began to put those of my Family who were prepared for it, into Bands. In all we are 8 Men, 4 Women, 1 Boy and 2 Children, besides Mr. <hi>Seward</hi> and myself. The Conversion of one of the Men was particularly remarkable.—Not long since he was Master of a Ship which was lost near the Gulf of <hi>Florida.</hi> Providence was pleas'd to throw him and his Crew upon an Island, where they continually expected the Waters to overflow them. At the End of ten Days, they saw a Ship, and gave a Signal of Distress: The Ship made towards them. The Captain, now with me, went out with his Boat, and begged for a Passage for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and Men.—It was granted him on Condition he would leave some of his Crew behind upon the Island; but he would not consent: At length the other Commander agreed to take all. But as soon as ever my Friend put off the Boat to fetch his Men, the Commander made Sail and lest them. All this seemed quite <hi>against,</hi> but in the End GOD shewed it was intended <hi>for</hi> the Good of my Friend. After 30 Days Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon the Island, having fitted up the Boat with some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lanks they took out of a Ship which had been lost 5 Months before, <hi>Nine</hi> of them committed themselves to the Providence of GOD: The others cared not to venture themselves in so small a Boat. Having failed about 140 Leagues, they came at length to <hi>Ty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="97" facs="unknown:004633_0048_100DB2CD84FC61E8"/>
invited the Captain to Breakfast with me; and reminded him of the Goodness of GOD: He then seem'd serious; and coming very providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially in the same Ship with me, when I returned from <hi>Georgia,</hi> GOD was pleased to work more effectually upon his Soul. And he is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning with me to <hi>Georgia</hi> again. Many Offers have been made him to go into the World; but he rather chuses to suffer Affliction with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD. Most of my other Assistants have left good Places, and are willing freely to spend and be spent for the Good of the <hi>Orphan House.</hi> Several of them have already found, all I hope are seeking, CHRIST. We seem perfectly set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled already; and whatever Storms GOD may permit to attack us without, I hope we shall have a constant Peace within and among ourselves.—Blessed be GOD, I find myself compos'd, and perfectly resign'd; nay, much rejoiced at my present Situation. <hi>Oh that I could always have no other Will but GOD's!</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thursday, August</hi> 16. Had still greater Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to rejoice at the Regulation of my Family. Wrote several Letters; and began to have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers Morning and Evening; and spent above an Hour in exhorting and examining into the Interiours of my Fellow-Travellers, and went to Bed almost forgetful that I had ever been out in the World. <hi>Forever blessed be GOD's Holy Name, thro'</hi> CHRIST.</p>

<pb n="98" facs="unknown:004633_0049_100DB2CF31EE7C68"/>
much in my happy Settlement on board. In the Morning most of my Family were sick; I did not entirely escape: GOD enabled us to give Thanks; and as we came to sail more directly before the Wind, our Disorder gradually went off. Thus is humane Life chequer'd. I bless GOD we are in good Order; And if the Voyage ends as happily as it begins, we shall have abundant Reason to bless GOD for it. <hi>Grant this, O</hi> LORD, <hi>for thy dear Son's sake!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saturday, August</hi> 18. Made but small Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in our Way, there being but little Wind, and that not very fair, till about 6 this Evening, at which Time it favoured us very much. Was enlighten'd in Reading GOD's Word. Had my Heart warmed with a Sense of his Love and distinguishing Mercies. Was enlarged in Praying several Times with and for my Friends; and was very earnest with GOD to give me Grace to improve my present Retirement to his Glory, the Good of his Church, and the Edification of my own Soul. Perceived also my bodily Strength to encrease, and enjoyed such unspeakable Peace and Tranquility within, that I was often filled with a Holy Confusion, and was obliged to retire to give my Soul vent.—Our LORD, I am sure, sails with us. <hi>O infinitely condescending GOD!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sunday, August</hi> 19. Administred the Holy Sacrament early this Morning. Sung an Hymn and continued in Prayer for near an Hour after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in Behalf of ourselves and absent Friends. My Heart was much melted down <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> enlarged. The Power which was given me was soon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:004633_0049_100DB2CF31EE7C68"/>
to my Companions: They sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thized and wept with me. A Spirit of Love seem'd to be sent forth amongst us. <hi>May it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease ever more and more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Both at Morning and Evening Prayers the Captain and Ships Company attended very order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Remainder of the Day was spent in Reading, Prayer, Singing and Praising GOD. The Ship continued sailing directly before the Wind, at the Rate of about 5 or 6 Miles an Hour:—Most seem'd sensible of, and thankful for the Divine Mercies. <hi>Thanks be to GOD for this unspeakable Gift.</hi> Amen, <hi>Lord JESUS.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monday, August</hi> 20. Fair Wind all Night, by which our Ship was carried to the Bay of <hi>Biscay,</hi> and went before the Wind at 6 Miles an Hour, almost the whole Day. The Wind being brisk, and a great Swell coming out of the Bay, most of us grew sick, and could do little else but lie down upon our Beds. This rejoiced me much; for I had a glorious Opportunity of spending many Hours in strict Communion with GOD, to ask Pardon for the Defects of my publick Ministry, and to pray for Strength against future Work and Trials. My Soul was frequently dissolved into Tears.—A Sense of my actual Sins and natural Deformity, humbled me exceedingly: And then the Freeness and Riches of GOD's Everlasting Love, broke in with such Light and Power upon my Soul, that I was often awed into Silence, and could not speak any more.—A dear Companion was with me, and help'd me to lament, pray, and give Praise. <hi>Oh the Comforts
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:004633_0050_100DB33A120EC998"/>
of Religious Friendship! Sanctify it, O LORD, to me, for thy dear Son's sake!</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Tuesday, August</hi> 21. Contrary Winds all Day, and the Swell continuing, kept all my Family, as well as myself, a little sickish. I conversed with GOD by Prayer and his Word most of the Time, and felt Enlargement of Heart in the Evening. <hi>Oh that by Conversing with GOD I may be changed from Glory to Glory, and fitted for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he has appointed for me to do or suffer, during my Pilgrimage here on Earth!</hi>

                     <hi>Saturday, August</hi> 25. Had but little regular Sleep since <hi>Tuesday;</hi> the Winds continuing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:—Last Night it blew a hard Gale. Most of my Family still continues sick;—I waited on them as well as I could, and prayed to GOD to make me willing to become the Servant of ALL. Frequently interceded for absent Friends, and remembred those in particular, who by their kind Presents administred much to our Comfort on Board. Had two or three providential Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences with the Captain of the Ship, and some of the Men. Read Dr. <hi>Guise</hi> his Paraphrase on the Evangelist St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> I think it the best I ever met with. Endeavoured to keep close to GOD, by Watching unto Prayer, for Direction and Help in Time of Need. Frequently was enlighten'd to see the Pride and Selfishness of my Heart; and as frequently long'd for that perfect Liberty wherewith JESUS CHRIST sets his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants free. The Sea was calmer to Day than before.—My Family grew better, and we spent near two Hours this Evening, in talking of the
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:004633_0050_100DB33A120EC998"/>
inward State of our Souls, and preparing for the Reception of the blessed Sacrament. <hi>LORD, grant that we all may have on a Wedding Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

                     <hi>Sunday August</hi> 26. Administred the Holy Sacrament early this Morning.—Spent the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the Day in Reading, Intercession, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> GOD was pleased to enlighten me in Reading his holy Word,—and gave me Satisfaction in the Behaviour of those about me. The Wind was still contrary, and the Sea rough, but I had a great Calm and Joy in my Soul. <hi>How can I be thankful enough for the glorious Opportunity I now enjoy for Self-Improvement. Let all that is within me, praise GOD's holy Name.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Monday, August</hi> 27. Had the Pleasure of seeing three <hi>Jamaica</hi> Ships come altogether: Two of which spoke to us, and by them we sent News of our Situation to <hi>England.</hi> Was much assisted in Writing an Account of GOD's Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with me in my infant Days, which I have prayed for Strength to do these three Years, but never had Power given me till this Day. Blessed be GOD, the Weather was more calm, the Wind more fair, and my Family better and better; so that I trust we shall get Strength against future Crosses.—As yet this is the most comfortable Voyage I have made. <hi>Oh that I may grow in Grace, and then my Happiness will encrease daily!</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Tuesday, August</hi> 28. Calm Weather and smooth Sea. Was assisted in Reading the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Rejoiced much in the good Behaviour of

Was visited with frequent inward Trials. Had many Things on my Heart to write, but am as yet withheld. Ended the Week comfortably with my Family, and was exceedingly strengthen'd in reading Professor <hi>Frank'</hi>s Account of the Orphan-house of <hi>Glaucha</hi> in <hi>Hall.</hi>—It seems in many Circumstances, to be so exactly parallel to my present Undertaking for the Poor of <hi>Georgia,</hi> that I trust the Orphan-house about to be erected there, will be carried on and ended with the like Faith and Success. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

The Day was calm and clear; and tho' we do not go forwards much in our Course, yet I trust we shall every Day be fitted more and more, for those various Turns of Providence which I expect we shall meet with when we come to Shore. <hi>Let thy Grace, O LORD, be more than sufficient for us.

Remembrance of my Sins, and the bitter Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of them.—Surely my Sorrows were so great, that had not GOD in the Midst of them, comforted my Soul, the Lord would have been insupportable.—All the While, I was assured GOD had forgiven me, but I could not forgive myself, for sinning against so much Light and Love.—Methought I felt something of that which <hi>Adam</hi> felt when turned out of Paradise: <hi>David</hi> when he was convicted of his Adultery; and <hi>Peter</hi> when with Oaths and Curses he thrice denied his Master.—I then, if ever, did truly smite upon my ungrateful Breast, and cry, <hi>GOD be merciful to me a Sinner.</hi> I eat but very little, and went mourning all the Day long.—At length my LORD looked upon me, and with that Look melted my rocky Heart, and Floods of contrite Tears flowed out before my whole Family; and indeed I wept most bitterly.—When in this Condition, I wonder'd not at <hi>Peter'</hi>s running so slowly to the Sepulchre, when loaded with a Sense of Guilt.—Alas! a Consideration of ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated Crimes quite took off my Chariot-Wheels, and I drove so exceeding heavily, that was I always to see myself such a Sinner as I am, and as I did then, I should not be able so much as to look up.

                     <hi>Sunday, October</hi> 7. Administred the Holy Sacrament, had a Love-Feast and expounded as usual. The Wind blowing very fresh, the Ship Men were obliged to attend the Sails, and so could not come to publick Worship. Sailed sometimes 9 Miles an Hour, for which we endeavoured to praise the LORD. Had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Communion with GOD, in interceding for our dear Friends on Shore; and at Night felt such Freedom in my Spirit, from a Load I labour'd under, as caused me to break out into many Thansgivings to GOD. Every Day more and more convinces me, that the LORD will fulfil the Desires of them that fear him: He is the Father of Mercies; He is the GOD of all Consolation; He can create Comfort out of Nothing, and bring Comfort out of the greatest

The Power of Writing has been in a great Measure taken from me; but GOD has been with me in Reading, Expounding and my other Exercises of Devotion.

                     <hi>Tuesday, October</hi> 30. Had sweet Communion with GOD last Night. Prayed with, exhorted and solemnly recommended my Family to the Grace of our dear LORD JESUS, expecting to go on Shore. This Morning, being near <hi>Cape Hinlopen,</hi> a Pilot came on board, in whose Boat Brother <hi>Seward,</hi> myself, and another dear Friend, went to <hi>Lewes-Town,</hi> in Order that we might go to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> by Land, and get a House in Readiness before the Ship arrived in that Place.—Whilst in the Boat, I hope each of our Hearts was filled with a Sense of GOD's Love; and when we reached <hi>Lewes-Town,</hi> which was about Evening, I took the first Opportunity of retiring to vent my Heart in Praise and Thanksgiving, for his abundant Mercies conferr'd on me and mine.—Oh how can I be thankful enough for this blessed Voyage! I have been on board just Eleven Weeks, but they have seem'd to me only as so many Days;—My inner Man has been much better'd by it; my Knowledge, I trust, in spiritual Things increased; my Understanding
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:004633_0057_100DB2DD7A5F7370"/>
enlightned to see my Corruptions, and my Heart much enlarged in writing Letters and other Things. The Remembrance of my Humiliation is sweet unto my Soul; and the Freedom which GOD has given me over some darling Failings, fills me with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory. My Family also have great Reason to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: GOD has been pleased to work upon many of their Hearts, and I believe none of them repent Leaving their Native Country. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Alteration is to be seen in two Friends Children, a Boy and a Girl, which I brought with me:—They are little more than 3 Years old, and can read in the Primer, and sing Part of <hi>Kenn'</hi>s Hymns very prettily; they have born the Voyage better than any in the Ship, and are under great Discipline; they are both generally employed either in Working or Reading, and are taught to make Work their Diversion; the little Boy picks Pease, and the little Girl sews with her Needle; the Proficiency they have made gives me great Satisfaction, and I hope is an Earnest of the Improvement that will be seen in the poor Children that are shortly to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to my Care.

After Sermon, the High-Sheriff, Collector and Head Men of the Place, came and took an affectionate Leave of me: And by their Means being provided with Horses, and a Guide for our Journey, at a very reasonable Expence; about 5 in the Evening we left <hi>Lewes-Town,</hi> and rode very pleasantly near 27 Miles through the Woods; about 10 we stopped at what they call a Tavern, which was not very commodious, but the Host and Hostess were plain well-meaning People; they made us a Cake of unleavened Bread; let us have a little Cyder and a few Eggs, and we went to Bed rejoicing exceedingly.

                  <p>Was visited again in the Evening, by the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> &amp; <hi>Baptist</hi> Ministers, who were much rejoiced to hear JESUS CHRIST preached in the Church. Whilst I was conversing with them, some Women came, desiring they might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Evening Prayers with my Family: I looked on this as a Hint from Providence; called them up, and found much Enlargement of Heart in exhorting them, and pouring out my Heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD in their Behalf.

of People, who came as last Night, to hear the Gospel of CHRIST. Blessed be GOD, I found much Freedom of Spirit; but having taken Cold, was obliged to leave off sooner than otherwise I should have done: However, in the midst of the Weakness and Purging of my Body, the Thoughts of seeing People come so gladly to hear the Word, refresh'd and comforted my Soul. <hi>LORD make it my only Joy to see thy Kingdom advanced and carried on.</hi> Amen <hi>and</hi> Amen.</p>

<pb n="122" facs="unknown:004633_0061_100DB2E80982FF60"/>
the Congregation still encreased. Visited a sick Person, to whom I was sent for, and perceived the Power of the LORD was present, both with the sick Person and those that attended around the Bed. Most wept sorely at the Preaching of Faith. Was visited in a kind Manner by the Minister of the Parish: And preached again at Six in the Evening, from the Court-House Steps. I believe there were near 2000 more present to Night than last Night. Even in <hi>London,</hi> I never observ'd so profound a Silence before my Coming. All was exceeding hush'd &amp; quiet. The Night was clear, but not Cold. Lights were in most of the Windows all around us, for a considerable distance. The People did not seem weary of standing, nor was I weary of speaking. The LORD endued me with Power from on high. My Heart was enlarged and warmed with divine Love. My Soul was carried out in Prayer, that I thought I could have continued my Discourse all Night. After I came home, some desired to join in Family Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers; and in that Exercise the divine Presence was manifest amongst us. <hi>Surely God has a Favour unto this People!</hi> At present they seem most gladly to receive, and sweetly to melt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Word. <hi>LORD, I beseech thee, manifest forth thy Glory more and more: And grant that much People in this City may be enabled to believe on thee!

                  <p>
                     <hi>Saturday, November</hi> 10. Before it was light, came a young Person whom I observ'd to be much affected last Night, desiring to join in Prayer; and
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:004633_0061_100DB2E80982FF60"/>
after our Devotions were ended, she put into my Hand the following Letter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Oh! what shall I say to express my Thanks I owe to my good GOD, in and from you, thro' JESUS CHRIST; which you have been the happy Instrument of beginning in my Soul: And if you have any Regard to a poor, miserable, blind and naked Wretch, that's not only Dust, but Sin, as I am confident you have, you will in no wise reject my humble Request; which is, that I, even I who am the most unworthy, may lay hold on this blessed Opportunity of forsaking all, in order to persevere in a virtuous Course of Life: Despise not thou thine Hand-Maiden; but O let me say, as <hi>Ruth</hi> the <hi>Moabitess</hi> said to her Mother-in-Law, <hi>Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee; for whither thou goest I will go, and whither thou art there will I be also; thy People shall be my People, and thy GOD my GOD.</hi> Thus am I fully determined. I pray and beg that you would not despise thy poor, forlorn and destitute Fellow-Creature; and the LORD recompence thy Work, and a full Reward be given unto thee of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, under whose Wings I am come to trust.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Soon after came a little Maid, about 7 Years of Age, telling me, she heard I took little Children to <hi>Georgia,</hi> and desired me to take her. In the remaining Part of the Morning several gracious Souls of different Communions, paid me a most loving Visit, and my Heart was much refresh'd with their pious Conversation. About 11 I read
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:004633_0062_100DB2EA63FF4948"/>
Prayers and preached in the Church, to a larger Audience than before. Din'd with the Minister of the Parish; and at my Return Home, was much comforted by the Coming of one Mr. <hi>Tennent,</hi> an old, grey-headed Disciple and Soldier of JESUS CHRIST. He keeps an Academy about 20 Miles off <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and has been bless'd with <hi>four</hi> gracious Sons, <hi>three</hi> of which have been, and still continue, to be eminently useful in the Church of CHRIST:—He brought three pious Souls along with him, and rejoiced me, by letting me know how they had been evil spoken of for their Master's sake:—He is a great Friend to Mr. <hi>Erskine</hi> of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and as far as I can find, both he and his Sons are secretly despised here, by the Generality of the Synod, as Mr. <hi>Erskine</hi> and his Brethren are hated by the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and as the Methodist Preachers (as they are called) are by their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in <hi>England.</hi> Tho' we are but few, and stand, as it were, alone, like <hi>Elijah;</hi> and they, like the Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> are many in Number; yet I doubt not but the LORD will appear for us, as he did for that Prophet, and make us more than Conquerors over all.</p>
                  <p>About 3 went to the Prison, and preached on the <hi>Trembling Jailor.</hi>—The Place was crouded, and many wept. Return'd home with the <hi>Swedish</hi> Minister and old Mr. <hi>Tennent.</hi> Conversed of the Things of GOD for a considerable Time; then preached in the Evening to as large a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation as there was last Night, from the Court-House Stairs. <hi>Satan</hi> endeavoured to
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:004633_0062_100DB2EA63FF4948"/>
interrupt us about the Middle of the Discourse; for the People were frightned with they knew not what, but they were soon at Peace. I preached above an Hour; and when I had finished, the People seemed unwilling to go away, so I began to pray afresh, and I hope the LORD sent them Home with his Blessing. Many to my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, have been already quicken'd, and awaken'd to see that Religion does not consist in outward Things, but Righteousness, Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost. <hi>Oh that they may not only receive the Word with Joy for a Season, but bring forth Fruit unto Perfection!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After Preaching, my House was filled with People, who came in to join in Psalms and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Prayer: My Body was somewhat weak, but the LORD strengthen'd and enlarged my Heart. Many wept most bitterly whilst I was praying; their Hearts, I believe, were loaded with a Sense of Sin, the only Preparative for the Soul-refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Visitations of JESUS CHRIST. Blessed be the LORD for sending me hither: This has been a Day of fat Things. <hi>LORD, give me Humility, and make me truly thankful.</hi> Amen, <hi>LORD</hi> JESUS.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sunday, November</hi> 10. Read Prayers in the Morning. Dined with the Collector. Preached in the Afternoon to a very thronged Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Visited one sick Person; and administred the holy Sacrament to another, who has received no such Peace and inward Comfort for these 12 Years, as GOD has been pleased to communicate to her Soul at this Time. <hi>Not unto me, O Lord,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:004633_0063_100DB2EC81BD0D98"/>
not unto me, but unto thy Name be all the Glory.</hi> For ever adored be the Divine Goodness, the Gospel has taken Root in many Hearts. As soon as I come Home, my House is generally filled with People, desirous to join in Psalms and Prayers; they are so eager after the Bread of Life, that they scarce can give me Time to take bodily Refreshment, and proper Retirement in my Closet: GOD, I am persuaded, has a Favour unto them. My Power and Freedom of Speech encreases daily, and this Afternoon I was carried out much, in Bearing my Testimony against the Unchristian Principles and Practices of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of our Clergy. Three of my Reverend Brethren were present; I know not whether they were offended; I endeavoured to speak with Meekness as well as Zeal; and I find the Necessity more and more, of Discovering those that are only Wolves in Sheep's Cloathing. Was I to convert <hi>Papists,</hi> my Business would be to shew they were misguided by the Priests; and if I want to convince <hi>Church of England Protestants,</hi> I must prove, that the Generality of their Teachers do not preach or live the Truth as it is in JESUS: For in vain we hope to set People right, till we demonstrate, that the Way they have been taught, is wrong Perhaps this may cost me my Life; but what have I to do with that?</p>

                     <hi>Wednesday, November</hi> 14. Set out early from <hi>Brunswick,</hi> in Company with my dear Fellow-Travellers, and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y worthy Brother and Fellow-Labourer Mr. <hi>Tennent.</hi> As we passed along, we spent our Time most agreeably in telling one another what GOD had done for our Souls. He recounted to me many sweet Instances of GOD's striving with his Heart, and how Grace at last overcame all his Fightings against GOD. About Noon we got to <hi>Elizabeth-Town,</hi> 22 Miles from <hi>Brunswick.</hi> Here we took Boat, and about 4 reached <hi>New-York,</hi> where we were most affectionately received by the Family of Mr. <hi>Noble.</hi> As soon as we had refreshed our Bodies by Eating a little Food, and our Souls by giving of Thanks, I waited upon Mr. <hi>Vesey,</hi> the Commissary, but he was not at Home; then I went to the Meeting-House, to hear Mr. <hi>Gilbert Tennent</hi> preach, and never before heard such a searching Sermon; he went to the Bottom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and did not daub with untemper'd Mortar: He convinc'd me more and more, that we can preach the Gospel of CHRIST no farther than we have experienced the Power of it in our own Hearts. Being deeply convicted of Sin, and driven from time to time off his false Bottom and Dependencies, by GOD's holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Spirit, at his first Conversion, he has learned experimentally to dissect the Heart of a natural Man.—Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites must either soon be converted or enraged at his Preaching:—He is a <hi>Son of Thunder,</hi> and
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:004633_0065_100DB2F0AF282C90"/>
does not regard the Face of Man:—He is deeply sensible of the Deadness and Formality of the Christian Church in these Parts, and has given noble Testimonies against it. After Sermon we spent the Evening together at Mr. <hi>Noble'</hi>s House; at their Request, I expounded and prayed, and after we had sung a Psalm, we took our Leaves of each other, and went to rest. My Soul was humbled and melted down with a Sense of GOD's Mercies; and I found more and more, what a Babe and Novice I was in the Things of GOD. <hi>Blessed</hi> JESUS, <hi>grant I may make conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Advances, till I come to a perfect Man in Thee!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thursday, Nov.</hi> 15. Had several come to see me at my Lodgings, who also gave me kind Invitations to their Houses. Waited upon Mr. <hi>Vesey;</hi> but could wish for his own Sake, he had behaved in a more Christian Manner. He seem'd to be full of Anger and Resentment; and before I asked him the Use of the Pulpit, denied it. He desired to see my Letters of Orders. I told him they were left at <hi>Philadelphia.</hi> He asked me for my License: I told him, I never heard that my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> as yet, gave any License to any one that went to preach the Gospel in <hi>Georgia;</hi> but that I was presented to the Living of <hi>Savannah</hi> by the Trustees; and upon that Presentation had Letters dimissory from my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> which I thought was Authority sufficient. But this was by no Means satisfactory. He charged me with Breaking my Oath, for Breaking the Canons, which enjoins Ministers
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:004633_0066_100DB2F4038181B8"/>
and Church-Wardens not to admit Persons into their Pulpits without a License. Alas! how can I break that, when I am neither a Church-Warden, nor have any Church hereabouts to admit any one into? Upon this, hearing he was a Frequenter of Publick Houses, I reminded him of that Canon which forbids the Clergy to go into any such Places.—This, tho' spoke in the Spirit of Meekness, stirred up his Corruptions more and more. He charged me with making a Disturbance at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and sowing and causing Divisions in other Places; <hi>But,</hi> says he, with a Sneer, <hi>you have a Necessity laid upon you to preach.</hi> I told him, I had; for the Clergy and Laity of our Church seem'd to be settled on their Lees; but my End was not to sow Divisions, but to propagate the pure Gospel of JESUS CHRIST. He said, <hi>they did not want</hi> my <hi>Assistance.</hi> I replied, if they did preach the Gospel, I wished them good Luck in the Name of the LORD; but as he had denied me the Church without my asking for the Use of it, I would preach in the Fields, for all Places were alike to me. <hi>Yes,</hi> says he, <hi>I find you have been used to that.</hi> After that, he taxed me with Censuring my Superiors. I told him, I was no Respecter of Persons; if a Bishop committed a Fault, I would tell him of it; if a common Clergyman did not act aright, I would be free with him also, as well as with a Lay man,—Whilst we were talking he called for some Wine, and I drank his Health. Soon after he rose up; said he had Business to do; and, as we were
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:004633_0066_100DB2F4038181B8"/>
going out, full of Resentment he said to Mr. <hi>Noble,</hi> who accompanied me and Brother <hi>Seward, Mr.</hi> Noble, <hi>as you have sent for this Gentleman, so I desire you will find him a Pulpit.</hi> Alas! alas! what Manner of Spirit are the Generality of the Clergy possess'd with? Is this the Spirit of the meek Lamb of GOD? Are these the Fruits of the Holy Ghost, which they pretended to be moved with, when they took Holy Orders? It cannot be. Surely the Kingdom of GOD will be taken from them: The Curse which fell on <hi>Eli'</hi>s Sons, I fear, will light on them: They cause the Sacrifice of GOD to be abhorred: Their Bigotry, if it was nothing else, in Time would destroy them. <hi>LORD! for thy Mercies sake, lighten their Darkness; and grant that some of the Priests also may be obedient to the Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Din'd with Mr. <hi>Pemberton,</hi> the Presbyterian Minister. Preached in the Fields to upwards of 2000, as Three in the Afternoon, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded at Six in the Evening to a very thronged and attentive Audience at Mr. <hi>Pemberton'</hi>s Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-House. At first for the sake of my weak Brethren, I was unwilling to Preach there; but hearing that Mr. <hi>Vesey,</hi> the Commissary himself, had preach'd in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Calvinistical Meeting-House, when there was no Place of Worship for the People of our own Community; and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Meeting-House being denied me, as well as the Church, I thought it my Duty to accept of the kind Offer made me by Mr. <hi>Pemberton</hi> and his Friends. In the Field, some few Mock'd; but GOD gave me Power to speak to them, and
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:004633_0067_100DB2F6A843D4B0"/>
they grew more serious. At Night, the People seem'd exceedingly attentive; and I have not felt greater Freedom in Preaching, and more Power in Prayer, and a stronger Indwelling of the Spirit, since I came into <hi>America,</hi> than I have at <hi>New-York.</hi> I find it has been a secure Place, and but little of the Work of GOD seen in it for many Years. <hi>Oh that this may be the accepted Time! LORD, let this be the Day of their Salvation!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Friday, November</hi> 16. Preached at Three in the Afternoon, to a lovely Congregation, in the Meeting-House, it being too cool to go into the Fields.—Expounded again in the Evening at the same Place to a far greater Congregation than I have seen yet. Great Multitudes returned home for want of Room. GOD enabled me to Preach with Power; and I hope some Good will be done here, because Satan is disturbed. After Evening Service, I was told by several Persons, that the Constables of the Town had been placed at the Door of the <hi>English</hi> Church, lest my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, encouraged by me, should break it open and take it by Force. Well may the Heads of our Church People be said to reject the Kingdom of GOD against themselves. I fear GOD will shortly take it from them. They imitate the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> in their Crimes: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> fear they will be made Partakers of their Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Oh that they would see in this their Day the Things that belong to their Peace!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saturday, November</hi> 17. Preached as usual in the Afternoon at the Meeting-House to a pretty
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:004633_0067_100DB2F6A843D4B0"/>
Congregation: And again at Night, to a great Multitude, standing round the Doors, beside those that were within. <hi>Wo be to those, who by their Bigotry, Prejudice and Party Zeal, oblige us to Preach the Gospel in so confined a Place:</hi> But no Matter; this as well as every Thing else shall be over-ruled for the good of CHRIST'S Church.—Had the Pleasure of Hearing that some blessed Effects had been produced by the Preaching of the Word; and several expressed a strong Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to go with me. When GOD will work, who can hinder? <hi>Praised be the LORD, who daily shews me this is the Way wherein I should go. LORD, make me humble and thankful!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sunday, November</hi> 18. Preached this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Eight a Clock, unto a very attentive Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory. Went to the <hi>English</hi> Church, both Morning and Evening, and felt my Heart al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most bleed within me, to consider what blind Guides were sent forth into her. If I have any Regard for the Honour of CHRIST, and the good of Souls, I must lift up my Voice like a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and shew how sadly our Church Ministers are fallen from the Doctrines of the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Her Prophets prophesy Lies, and I fear many of the People love to have it so. <hi>It is high Time, O LORD, that thou have Mercy upon</hi> Sion. <hi>Oh let that Time shortly come!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the second Lesson in the Morning, were these Verses, and some I found made an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Application of them, by looking on me. <hi>John,</hi> Chap. X. Ver. 19, 20, 21. <hi>There was a Division therefore again among the</hi> Jews, <hi>for
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:004633_0068_100DB2F8F504CCB8"/>
these Sayings. And many of them said, he hath a Devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? Others said, these are not the Words of him that hath a Devil.</hi> In the Evening vast Numbers flocked to hear the Word. Some petitioned the Mayor to have the use of the Town-Hall; but it was denied: Then we thought of expounding out of a Window, and to let the People stand in the Street; but at last, with much Difficulty, I got into the Meeting-House; and the People being prevailed on to open the Windows, Numbers could hear that stood on the outside. GOD was pleased to enlarge my Heart, and I was pressed in Spirit to bear my Testimony against the Doctrines deliver'd in the <hi>English</hi> Church, both Morning and Evening. Tho' it may seem a hard Saying to many, yet our People have need to be caution'd against the Generality of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> of our Communion, as much as the <hi>Jews</hi> were cautioned to beware of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> by our dear LORD JESUS. After Sermon, many People came to pray with me, and take a last Farewel. They also gave me Tokens of Love, and I had great Reason to believe GOD has begun a good Work in <hi>New-York.</hi> I have not felt such Freedom and Sweetness of Soul since I have been in <hi>America;</hi> one Reason I believe is, because I have been here uncommonly opposed. Saw my Sermon on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation advertised in the <hi>New-England</hi> Paper. Gave leave for my Answer to my Lord of <hi>London</hi> to be printed at <hi>New-York.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About Ten at Night, having spent some time
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:004633_0068_100DB2F8F504CCB8"/>
in Prayer, I took Boat with my Friends, and had a pleasant Passage to a Place about Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to <hi>Elizabeth-Town,</hi> where we lay down with Joy and Thankfulness for the great Things the LORD had shewn us. <hi>Oh that I was duly sensible of his distinguishing Mercies!</hi>

Spent the Morning in writing Letters and Journal, and in Religious Conversation with dear Mr. <hi>Tennent,</hi> Mr. <hi>Noble,</hi> and other Friends, who accompanied me. Paid a Visit to Mr. <hi>Vaugh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     </hi> the Minister of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Elizabeth-Town;</hi> who, as I afterwards heard, had preached against me, and said, I should not have the Use of his Pulpit. Din'd with Mr. <hi>Dickinson</hi> the Dissenting Minister, who had sent a Letter of Invitation to <hi>New-York,</hi> and offer'd me the Use of his Meeting-House; About Twelve I preach'd in it according to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, to upwards of 700 People, many of which seemed much affected; and GOD was pleased to open my Mouth against both Ministers and People among the Dissenters, who hold the Truth in Unrighteousness, contenting themselves with a bare speculative Knowledge of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Grace, but never experienced the Power of them in their Hearts. <hi>These shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the greater Condemnation.</hi>

in worthy Mr. <hi>Tennent'</hi>s Meeting-House, to a large Assembly gather'd together from all Parts; and amongst them, as Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> told me, there was a great Body of solid Christians. About Three in the Afternoon I preach'd again; and at seven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Baptized two Children; and preach'd a third Time, with greater Freedom than at either of the former Opportunities. It is impossible to tell with what Pleasure the Children of GOD heard these Truths confirm'd by a Minister of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which for many Years have been preach'd to them by their own Pastor Mr. <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</hi> Opposers Mouths were stop'd; several were brought under strong Convictions; and our LORD'S dear Disciples were ready to leap for Joy. To me, the Meeting seemed to be like the Meeting of the twelve Tribes, when they came from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Parts to Worship the LORD at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Among others that came to hear the Word, were several Ministers, whom the LORD has been pleased to honour, in making them Instruments of bringing many Sons to Glory. The one was a <hi>Dutch</hi> Calvinistical Minister, named <hi>Freeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausen,</hi> Pastor of a Congregation about four Miles off <hi>New-Brunswick:</hi> He is a worthy old Soldier of JESUS CHRIST, and was a Beginner of the great Work, which I trust the LORD is carrying on in these Parts. He has been strongly opposed by his carnal Brethren; but GOD has always appeared for him in a surprizing Manner, and made him more than Conqueror over all. thro' his Love: He has long since learned to Fear him only, who can destroy both Body and
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:004633_0069_100DB2FAD2647348"/>
Soul in Hell. Another was one Mr. <hi>Cross,</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of a Congregation at <hi>Baskinridge,</hi> about 20 Miles from <hi>Brunswick:</hi> A most remarkable Outpouring of the Spirit has been frequently seen in his Congregation, for which he has been much opposed by natural Men: He himself told me of many wonderful Effects, and sudden Conversions that had been wrought by the LORD under his Ministry. For some time eight or nine used to come to him together in deep Distress of Soul; and I think he said, two Hundred of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, which is not very large, were effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually brought home to CHRIST: But tho' they are the excellent Ones of the Earth, they are looked upon as Enthusiasts and Madmen, and treated as such by those that know not GOD, and are ignorant of the hidden Life of JESUS CHRIST in their Hearts: He indeed is one, who, I believe would rejoice to suffer for the LORD JESUS. <hi>Oh that I may be like minded!</hi> A third Minister was one Mr. <hi>Camphel,</hi> who has been a Preacher of the Doctrines of Grace for these four Years; was a regular moral Liver, and accounted a very good Man; but within these few Months, being convinced of Sin, and that he knew nothing experimentally of JESUS CHRIST, tho' he had pretended to preach him so long; after many Struggles with himself, he told the Presbytery he was unconverted, and therefore durst not preach till he was converted: Accordingly he has le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="140" facs="unknown:004633_0070_100DB2FD1172ACC0"/>
looked upon as melancholy, and besides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; but I had much Discourse with him, and really believe these Humiliations will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him for great and eminent Services in the Church of GOD.—His Case puts me in mind of Professor <hi>Frank,</hi> who being on <hi>Easter-Day</hi> to preach on the Nature of Divine Faith, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had not that Faith himself, was convicted by GOD of his unregenerate State, upon which he ran into the Woods, was there deeply humbled, and at last became a most exalted Instance of Faith. At our Persuasion, Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> promised to preach next <hi>Sunday<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and, I believe, will be instrumental of convicting many Heart-Hypocrites among the Dissenting Ministers: For that there are such, is evident from this; tho' they have been bred up in, and preach the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Grace, yet whenever the Power of GOD appears in any Congregation, they cry it down, as much as our Ministers of the Church of <hi>England. Oh that the LORD may Comfort poor Mr.</hi> Campbell, <hi>and cause him to detect these Wolves in Sheep's Cloathing!</hi> With these Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and many other Disciples of our dear LORD JESUS, I took sweet Counsel. We eat our Bread with Gladness and Singleness of Heart; and comforted ourselves with this Consideration, that, tho' we must be separated from each other on this Earth, yet we should sit down to eat Bread with <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Hasten, O LORD, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

At Noon we got there, and preached from a Waggon to about 1500 Persons, on the <hi>Conversion of St. Paul;</hi> and GOD was pleased to direct my Words, and enable me to preach so suitably to the poor despised Christians in these Parts, that they knew not well how to express their Satisfaction. <hi>The LORD is gracious in all his Ways, and wonderful in all his Works. Oh that I could praise him as I ought!</hi> Here one Mr. <hi>Rowland,</hi> another faithful Minister of JESUS CHRIST, gave us the Meeting.—He has been a Preacher about 2 Years; has gone about doing Good, and had many Seals to his Ministry:—Much of the Simplicity of CHRIST was discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his Behaviour. <hi>Blessed be GOD, for sending such burning and shining Lights in this dark and dead Generation!

The unhappy Criminal seemed hardened; but I had great Reason to believe some Good was done in the Place. <hi>LORD, send forth others to carry it on, for thy dear Son's sake.</hi>

Set out for <hi>Neshaminy,</hi> 20 Miles distant from <hi>Trent-Town,</hi> where old Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> lives, and keeps an Academy, and where I was to preach to Day, according to Appointment. About 12 we came thither, and found about 3000 People gather'd together in the Meeting-House Yard.—Mr. <hi>William Tennent,</hi> an eminent Servant of JESUS CHRIST, because we staid beyond the Time appointed, was preaching to them. When I came up, he soon stopt; sung a Psalm, and then I began to speak as the LORD gave me Utterance. At first, the People seem'd unaffected; but in the Midst of my Discourse, the Power of the LORD JESUS came upon me, and I felt such a Struggling within myself for the People, as I scarce ever felt before.—The Hearers began to be melted down immediately, and cry much; and we had good Reason to hope the LORD intended good for many. After I had finished, Mr. <hi>Gilbert Tennent</hi>

gave a Word of Exhortation, to confirm what had been delivered. At the End of his Discourse we sung a Psalm, and then dismissed the People with a Blessing. <hi>Oh that the LORD may say</hi> Amen <hi>to it!</hi> After our Exercises were over, we went to old Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi>'s, who entertain'd us like one of the antient Patriarchs: His Wife to me seemed like <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and he like <hi>Zachary;</hi> both, as far as I can find, walk in all the Ordinances and Commandments of the LORD, blameless. Tho' GOD was pleased to humble my Soul, so that I was obliged to retire for a while; yet we had sweet Communion with each other, and spent the Evening in Concerting what Measures had best be taken, for Promoting our dear LORD's Kingdom. It happened very providentially, that Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> and his Brethren, are appointed to be a Presbytery, by the Synod; so that they intend Breeding up gracious Youths, and sending them out, from time to time, into our LORD's Vineyard.—The Place wherein the young Men study now, is, in Contempt, called, <hi>The College:</hi> It is a Log-House, about 20 Foot long, and near as many broad; and to me it seem'd to resemble the School of the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; for that their Habitations were mean, and that they sought not great Things for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, is plain from those Passages of Scripture wherein we are told, that <hi>each of them took a Beam to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

of our publick Universities, is, they are glorious without. From this despised Place, 7 or 8 worthy Ministers of JESUS have lately been sent forth; more are almost ready to be sent; and a Foundation is now Laying for the Instruction of many others. The Devil will certainly rage against them; but the Work I am persuaded is of GOD, and therefore will not come to nought. Carnal Ministers oppose them strongly; and because People, when awakened by Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> or his Brethren, see through, and therefore leave their Ministry; the poor Gentlemen are loaded with Contempt, and looked upon (as all faithful Preachers will be) as Persons that turn the World upside down. A notable War, I trust, is Commencing between <hi>Michael</hi> and the Dragon. We may easily guess who will prevail. <hi>The Seed of the Woman shall bruise the Serpent's Head.</hi>

As soon as I had done, fresh Invitations were made me, to come to several Places, would Time and Business permit.

Received an excellent Letter from one grievously vexed with Temptations, whom GOD has been pleased to make me an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Comforting. Preached again at four in the Afternoon, in the Church, that being judged

more convenient than the Market Place, as the Weather was so cold. A vast Concourse of all Denominations were present. GOD gave me, particularly towards the close of my Sermon, to speak with divine Energy.—After Sermon, I visited two sick Persons. Supped comfortably with my Family; and laid me down, with a strong Desire to see my own Unworthiness, and the Freeness and Riches of that Grace, which alone has made me to differ from the most abandon'd of Men. Whatever others may see in themselves I know not; this one Thing I know, I see nothing but Hell in my Soul. <hi>And therefore, whenever I do glory, I desire only to glory in thee O LORD!</hi>

At last I fix'd on one for the Morning; and trusted to GOD to direct me to one for the Evening: But before I came from Church, GOD shewed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

and brought a Text to prove an imputed Righteousness was a scriptural Expression. But thinking the Church an improper Place for Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, I said no more at that Time. The Portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle was, <hi>Jer.</hi> xxiii. wherein were these Words, <hi>THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</hi> Upon these I discoursed in the Afternoon. I shewed how the LORD JESUS was to be our whole Righteousness; proved how the contrary Doctrine overthrowed all Divine Revelation; answered all Objections, that were made against an imputed Righteousness; produced the Articles of our Church to illustrate it; and concluded with an Exhortation to all, to lay aside a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning Infidelity, and to submit to JESUS CHRIST, who is the End of the Law for Righteousness, to every one that believeth. The Verses at the beginning of the Chapter, out of which the Text was taken, were very remarkable. <hi>Jer.</hi> Chap.

The Church was thronged within and without, and all wonderfully attentive; and many, as I am inform'd convinced that the LORD CHRIST was our Righteousness.—In the Evening the Gentleman came to me; but alas! was so very dark in all the Fundamentals of Christianity; and such an entire Stranger to Inward Feelings, that I was obliged to say to him, <hi>Art thou a Master of</hi> Israel <hi>and knowest not these Things?

                     <hi>Wednesday, November</hi> 28. Redeemed a little Time before it was Light, to write a Letter or two to my dear Friends in <hi>England.</hi>—I have not had a Moment's Time before, since my Return from <hi>New-York.</hi> People are continually coming in, and enquiring with strong Cryings and many Tears. how they must come to CHRIST.

Heard of more that were under Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and as I was walking out to Dinner, a <hi>German</hi> came to me, saying, <q>Thou didst sow some good Seed yesterday in <hi>Germantown,</hi> and a Grain of it fell into my Daughter's Heart: She wants to speak with thee, that she may know what she must do to keep and encrease it.</q> The young Woman being near at Hand, came at her Father's Call.—Both melted into Tears immediately; and after I had exhorted her to watch and pray, and keep close to CHRIST by Faith, I took my Leave, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing GOD to water the good Seed his own Right Hand had planted in her Heart. In the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Notice had been given, that I should preach my Farewel-Sermon in the Afternoon; but the Church being not capable, tho' as large as most of our <hi>London</hi> Churches, to contain a fourth Part of the People, by the Advice of Friends we adjourned to the Fields; and I preached for an Hour and half from a Balcony, to upwards of 10,000 Hearers, very attentive, and much affected with what GOD enabled me to deliver. I endeavoured to come in all Plainness of Speech, without any Respect of Persons.—The Mention of my Departure was a Grief to many; and it almost melted me down, to see with what Eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and earnest Affection they followed after

the Preaching of the Word:—If I could preach they would attend all the Day long, <hi>Blessed be GOD, for this effectual Door!</hi> I wonder we have no more Adversaries: By and by I expect <hi>Satan</hi> and his Emissaries will rage horribly. I endeavoured to forewarn my Hearers of it. LORD, <hi>prepare us against a Day of spiritual Battle.</hi> Took my Leave of the Governor and Proprietor. Supp'd with one of the Church-Wardens and his Friends; and when I came Home, exhorted, sung Psalms and prayed with a great Company of People, who were waiting at my Door.

                        <p>I was heartily sorry that a Cold should hinder me from accompanying you into the <hi>Jerseys,</hi> but am in Hopes it was ordained by Divine Providence for the best.

tho' it was not a usual Season; and tho' the Warning was short, we had a numerous and attentive Audience. In short, I cannot but hope, your Coming amongst us has been a Means of Awakening some among us, to a serious Sense of practical Religion, and may be the Beginning of a good Work in this secure and sinful Place. Dear Sir, let your Prayers be joined with mine, for this desirable Blessing: I desire your Prayers for me in particular; that I may be faithful to my Master's Work; that I may be an Instrument in the Hands of CHRIST, of pulling down the strongest Holds of Sin and Satan, and building up the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's Kingdom in this Place. Pray for us, that the good Impressions any have received, may not wear off, and prove as the Morning Cloud and as the early Dew; but that he would grant a Resurrection of Religion in the Midst of us; that many may flock to CHRIST, as Doves to the Windows. I pray GOD take you under his Protection, sustain you under your many Trials, and make you gloriously success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to convert Sinners from the Error of their Ways, and turning them to the Wisdom of the Just. My Wife joins with me in affectionate Regard to you, Mr. <hi>Seward,</hi> and your other Friends, whom we love in Sincerity.</p>

Blessed be GOD for such Success at <hi>New-York:</hi> Nor is He working less here.—One of the Printers has told me he has taken above two Hundred Subscriptions for printing my Sermons and Journals.—Another Printer told me, he might have sold a Thousand Sermons if he had them; and by the Persuasions of my Friends, I gave out two of my extempore Discourses to be published, <hi>Dearest LORD, give them thy Blessing!</hi> Numbers of Letters have been sent me from Persons under Convictions; and it is unknown what deep Impressions have been wrought in the Hearts of Hundreds. An Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser told me, I had unhinged many good sort of People: And indeed I believe, many that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themselves with good Desires, are now convinced they must have good Habits also, and must be thoroughly born again, e'er they can see the Kingdom of GOD.—Many poor Sinners have, I trust, been called home, and great Numbers are under strong Convictions. And as I have sown spiritual Things, People are willing I should reap carnal Things; they have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sent me Butter, Sugar, Chocolate, Pickles, Cheese and Flour, for my poor Orphans, and indeed I could almost say, they would pluck out their own Eyes and give me. <hi>Blessed be GOD, for the great Work begun in these Parts.

                     <hi>Thursday, Novemb.</hi> 29. Had the Satisfaction of settling all my Family Affairs according to my Desire. Got considerably, by the Goods sold, for the Poor.—Had a Sloop lent me which Mr. <hi>Seward</hi> bought, named the <hi>Savannah,</hi> in which I left Orders for my Family to set sail, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after my leaving <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>—My Friend <hi>Gladman,</hi> mentioned in the Beginning of this, has been a Help meet for me, and done every Thing, without giving me any, or but little Trouble. <hi>Blessed be</hi> GOD. About Eleven in the Morning, having corrected two Sermons for the Press, I took an affectionate Leave of my Family and <hi>Philadelphia</hi> People. From seven in the Morning they thronged round the Door; and when we parted, Oh! how bitterly did the poor Souls weep.—As I passed along the Street, they came running out to the Doors, and discovered the Concern that was in their Hearts, by the Sorrow of their Countenance. Near 20 Gentlemen accompanied me on Horseback out of the Town: About seven Miles off another Company waited to join us; so that at last we were near 200 Horses. By Three we reached <hi>Chester,</hi> a Town 15 Miles distant from <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia;</hi> and after we had taken a little Food, I preached to near five Thousand People from a

Balcony. It being Court Day, the Justices sent Word, they would defer their Meeting till mine was over; and the Minister of the Parish, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Church would not contain the People, took Care himself to provide the Place from which I spoke. The People were very quiet and attentive; and as I was told, near 1000 came from <hi>Philadelphia.</hi> After Sermon many of them took their last Farewell, and wished me Good Luck in the Name of the LORD. About six in the Evening we left <hi>Chester,</hi> and came to <hi>Wilmington,</hi> 13 Miles, before Nine. The Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was warm; the Moon shone bright, and the pious Discourse we had on the Road, made the Time imperceptibly slide away. Two loving <hi>Quakers</hi> received us into their Houses. GOD was pleased also to refresh my Heart with a Sense of his Divine Love; and after I had given a Word of Exhortation, prayed with my own Friends, and some others that came in, I went to Bed, admiring the great Work that was begun by GOD in these Parts: I have not seen greater Things, considering the Places, no not in <hi>England.</hi> Oh! that the LORD, in answer to the People's Prayers, in his due Time, may bring me back hither again! I hope then to see some substantial Fruits of my present weak Endeavours. <hi>Dearest Redeemer, make me humble; prepare me for thy future Mercies, and whenever thou seest me in Danger of being puffed up above Measure, graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously send me a Thorn in the Flesh; so shalt thy Blessings not prove my Ruin!</hi>

Preached to about 2000 People from a Balcony about 1 a Clock, but did not speak with so much Freedom and Power as usual, by reason GOD was pleased to humble my Soul by inward Visitations and Bodily Indispositions. Lay on

the Bed after Sermon, which refreshed me much. Rode to, and preached at <hi>Christian-Bridge,</hi> near five Miles off, to about the same Number as was at <hi>New-Castle.</hi>—I believe 200 Horse came on the Road with us.—I had some edifying Discourse with some Children of GOD, as we came on the Way: And a great Power from GOD descended on me and the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, at the latter Part of the Sermon. I always observe inward Trials prepare me for, and are the certain Fore-runners of fresh Mercies. Oh what a gracious Melting of Souls was there! Enough to convince, one would imagine, the greatest Infidels. Oh with what Earnestness did People beseech me to visit other Places! Surely <hi>Herbert'</hi>s Prophecy is now fulfilling.</p>

Lay at the House of Mr. <hi>G—n;</hi> and this Morning went on board; prayed, sung Psalms, gave a Word of Exhortation, and rejoiced much to see all Things in such excellent Order. My dear Friend, the Captain, told me how kind the People of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia</hi> had been to my Family after my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; one brought them Butter, another Beer, Sweetmeats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Collector would not take his Perquisite for Clearing the Sloop.—The two Children the People were particularly fond of, and gave them so many Things, that I was

obliged to desire them to hold their Hands. <hi>Oh how plentiful are those Mercies which GOD has laid up for them that fear him, even before the Sons of Men!</hi> About Ten we came to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Bridge</hi> again, where we left some of our Friends last Night.

                     </gap>e to see such a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Horses; I believe there were several Thousands of them. I preached from a Tent erected for me by Order of Mr. <hi>Charles Tennent,</hi> whose Meeting-House lay near the place where I preached. I continued in my first Discourse for an Hour and half: Afterwards we went into a Log House near adjoining; and having taken a Morsel of Bread, and warmed ourselves, I preached a second Time from the same Place. My Body, I perceived, was a little weak; but GOD magnified his Strength, and caused his Power to be known in the Congregation; many Souls were melted down. And here I had the Pleasure of meeting with one Mr. <hi>Galaspey,</hi> mother faithful Minister of JESUS CHRIST, of he Dissenting Interest. He, as well as Mr. <hi>Tennent,</hi> was very solicitous for my going to his House; but being pre-engaged, I rode three Miles, and was kindly and hospitably entertain'd at one Mr. <hi>H</hi>—'s, who came with his Family some Years ago from <hi>Cardi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

and every Thing was carried on with so much Freedom and Love, that I rejoiced much that GOD had sent us hither. I staid up as long as I could; but finding my Body weak, from the Posture in which I stood to preach, about 10 a Clock, after Family Prayer, I went to Bed, thoroughly weary, but full of that Peace which the World cannot give, but which I wish the whole World were Partakers of.</p>

that I may prevail in their Behalf! It grieves me to my Soul to see poor Sinners hanging as it were by a single Hair, and dancing (insensible of their Danger) over the Flames of Hell. Oh that GOD may make me instrumental of plucking them as Fire-Brands out of the Fire! For here is the Misery of fallen Man; he is miserable, poor, and blind, and naked, and yet knows it not.

                     <hi>Thursday, December</hi> 6. Had a providential Opportunity of writing some Letters last Night and this Morning to <hi>England.</hi> Waited on Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor <hi>Ogle,</hi> and was received with Civility. Went to pay my Respects to Mr. <hi>Sterling,</hi> the Minister of the Parish, who happened not to be within; but whilst we were at Dinner, he came, and with the greatest Civility offered me his Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, his House, or any Thing he could supply me with. About sour he came and introduced me and my Friends to a Gentleman's House, where we had some useful Conversation: Our Discourse ran chiefly on the New-Birth, and the Folly and Sinfulness of those Amusements, whereby the polite Part of the World are so fatally diverted from the Pursuit after the One Thing needful. Some in Company, I believe, thought me too strict, and were very strenuous in defence of what they call innocent Diversions; but when I told them every Thing was sinful, which
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:004633_0082_100DB31BB7E77278"/>
was not done with a single Eye to GOD's Glory; and that such Entertainments not only discover'd a Levity of Mind, but were contrary to the whole Tenour of the Gospel; by this they seemed somewhat convinced, at least it set them upon Doubting: And I pray GOD they may doubt more; for Cards, Dancing, and such like, draw the Soul from GOD, and lull it asleep, as much as Drunkenness and Debauchery. And had a Minister the Authority of an Apostle, he could not imploy it better, than in exclaiming against the Entertainments of the polite Part of the World. For Ladies are as much wedded to <hi>Quadrille</hi> and <hi>Ombre,</hi> as Gentlemen are to their Bottle, and their Hounds: Self-pleasing, self-seeking, is the ruling Principle in both; and therefore, such Things are to be spoken against, not only as so many trifling Amusements, but as Things that shew that the whole Heart is aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Life of GOD. For if I may speak by my own, as well as others Experience, as soon as ever the Soul is born of GOD, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not away with any such Thing: Nothing but what leads towards GOD, can then delight it. And therefore, when in Company, I love to lay the Ax to the Root of the Tree; shew the Necessity of a thorough Change of Heart, and then all Things fall to the Ground at once.

Observed two Persons came in with the Family to Prayer last Night; and a visible Alteration was made in the Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the People of the House. Preach'd in the Morning and Evening to small, but polite Auditories. The Governor put by his Court to come to Morning Sermon; and at Noon, upon an Invitation sent last Night to me and my Friends, we din'd with him; he treated us very humanly: And in the Evening two of the Head Inhabitants favour'd me with a Visit. The Minister seem'd somewhat affected, and under Convictions: But I fear a false Politeness, and the Pomp and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the World, eat out the Vitals of Religion in this Place. I bless GOD, I did not spare to tell my Hearers of it in my Discourses; and the Minister told me they took it kindly. At Night four Persons came to join in Family Prayer; to whom I gave a warm Exhortation, for GOD was pleased to enlarge and shed abroad his Love in my Heart. <hi>Oh that GOD may open the Heart of some</hi> Lydia! <hi>Here are few Inhabitants, but GOD, I hope, will sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In the Evening some Gentlemen came disordered in Liquor; but the Woman of the House kept them from us, so we slept very comfortably on the Beds that she made us in the Kitchen. I talked of Religion as much as I could; but the Woman thought GOD was very merciful; that it would be no Harm to swear by her Faith; that we were to be born again after Death, and such like. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever she was very sollicitous to please us. And I could not help remarking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how the Devil loves to represent GOD as all Mercy or all Justice:—When Persons are awakened, he would, if possible, tempt them to despair; when dead in Trespasses and Sins, he tempts them to presume. <hi>LORD, preserve us from making Ship wreck against either of these Rocks! Give us such a Sense of thy Justice, as to convince us, that we

                     <hi>Tuesday, December</hi> 30. Better this Morning, than I have been for some Days past. Took our Leave of our kind Host, and travelled chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully on. About Noon we lighted off in the Woods, to give our Horses Provender, and to take a little Refreshment ourselves, which we have done every Day this Week, because there are no Ordinaries in the Way. No one can tell with what Gladness we eat our Food; and how comfortably we praised God, for spreading a Table
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:004633_0089_100DB32E57071C70"/>
for us in the Wilderness. By four in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon we reached <hi>Eden-Town,</hi> a little Place, but beautifully scituated by the Water-side. Here we were well entertained at a publick House; and tho' GOD was pleased to humble my Body by Weakness, and my Soul by Convictions of past Sins, yet before we went to Rest, he was pleased to refresh me with much Peace in the midst of my Humiliations; and exalt me, by giving me a more lively Sense of his Favour and loving Kindness. I think, I often feel what our LORD means, when he says, <hi>The</hi> Publican <hi>went down to his House justified, rather than the</hi> Pharisee. I doubt not, but while he was pouring out his Soul and smiting upon his Breast, the Holy Spirit overshadow'd and seal'd to him his Pardon. It is a dreadful Mistake, to deny the Doctrine of Assurance, or to think, it is confined to a Time of Persecution, or the Primitive Ages of the Church. Not only Righteousness and Peace, but Joy in the Holy Ghost (which is the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Assurance) is a necessary Part of the Kingdom of GOD within us. And tho' all are not to be condemned, who have not an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Assurance, yet all ought to labour after it. And I really believe, one great Reason why so many go mourning all their Life long, is owing to their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gnorance of their Christian Priviledge. They have not Assurance, because they ask it not; they ask it not, because they are taught, that it does not belong to Christians of these last Days; whereas, I know Numbers, whose Salvation is written upon their Hearts, as
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:004633_0089_100DB32E57071C70"/>
it were with a Sun-beam: They can rejoice in GOD their Saviour; and give Men and Devils the Challenge to separate them if they can from the Love of GOD in CHRIST JESUS their LORD. <hi>Dearest Redeemer, enlighten all thy Followers, to see their Priviledge; and never let them cease Wrestling with thee, till thou dost bless them, by assuring them of their Salvation.</hi>

                  <p>GOD's Providence sent us a Guide, and better Entertainment at our Inn than we have had for some Time. As we rode along, one of my Friends said, <hi>How dreadful must it be for a natural Man to be placed in such a howling Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, surrounded with those many Wolves, Bears and Tygers, which come forth at Night, Reading upon him; but then,</hi> added he, <hi>how infinitely more dreadful must it be, to be cast into Hell, and surrounded continually with the Howlings of demand Spirits!</hi> When we came to our Inn we were told of a Man and Woman, who were one Night surrounded with a Kennel of these Wolves, and pursued by them a long Way. This made me think of another Expression of Mr. <hi>Gilbert Tennent's,</hi> 
                     <q>The Creatures are up in Arms against us, to revenge their Maker's Quarrel.</q> 
                     <hi>Thanks be to</hi> GOD, <hi>for the Death and Resurrection of our dear Lord</hi> JESUS, <hi>who has not only deliver'd us from the Power of wild Beasts, but from Death and Hell itself.</hi>

All seem'd attentive to what was spoken. After Sermon one poor Woman came with a full Heart, desiring my Prayers. I asked her, whether she had been convicted by the Sermon, or whether she knew CHRIST? She answered, she had been seeking him for some Time; but wanted to find a Minister who had Understanding in divine Things.—Poor Woman! thy Case is common.

Cross'd <hi>New-River</hi> about four in the Afternoon; and reached <hi>New-Bern-Town,</hi> 32 Miles from <hi>Bath-Town,</hi> by six at Night. Perceived my Appetite to grow better. Experienced some inward Teachings of GOD's Spirit by the Way; and had a sweet Communion in Spirit, after I came to the Inn, with my dear Friends at <hi>England,</hi> who, I supposed, were join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with one Accord in fervent Prayer, and ushering in the Festival of our dear LORD's Nativity, by singing of Hymns and spiritual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Songs. This Time Twelve-Months, I was with them; and even now I am absent from them, my Soul is deeply united with theirs, and all GOD's Children, by the Spirit of his dear Son; and however separated here, this is my Comfort, Men or Devils can't keep us from meeting and dwelling together eternally hereafter. <hi>Oh that the Cry was made,</hi> Behold the Bridegroom cometh! <hi>As the Hart panteth after the Water-Brooks, so doth my Soul long for that Time wherein I shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Tuesday, December</hi> 25. Endeavoured still to keep my Mind as much as possible in Union with all those pious Souls, who I knew were Rejoicing in the glad Tidings of Salvation by JESUS CHRIST. Went to publick Worship, and received the Holy Sacrament, which was
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:004633_0092_100DB33771B288C0"/>
celebrated in the Court-House; but was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what discomposed, and mourned much in Spirit, to see in what an indifferent Manner every Thing was carried<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on. I cried mightily to the LORD in my secret Devotions: And in the Afternoon, when I read Prayers and preached, He was pleased to shew that he had heard me; for I scarce knew when we have had a more visible Manifestation of the Divine Presence, since our Coming into <hi>America.</hi> The People were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly attentive.—Most melted into Tears, and shewed what a great Impression the Word made upon their Hearts.—I myself was much carried out.—I felt the Power of GOD <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ome upon me, and spoke with Demonstration of the Spirit, to the Hearers Souls. After Sermon, a poor Woman with a full Heart, ran to me, desiring me that I would come and preach where she lived. Another told me I had given him a home Stroke. And indeed, I believe, all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elt an uncommon Power upon their Minds. The Woman where we lodged would take Nothing for our <hi>Christmas</hi> Dinner; and wished we could stay with them longer. This unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Success rejoiced me the more, because I looked upon it, as an Earnest of future and more plentiful Effusions of GOD's Spirit in these Parts. I really believe, whenever the Gospel is preached with Power in these Parts, it will be remarkably blessed. For I have not heard of one faithful Minister's being sent over amongst them. <hi>And how shall they believe on him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they

                     <hi>Wednesday, December</hi> 26. Set out early, and rode very pleasantly till Dinner Time. Me with some comfortable Refreshment at an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary upon the Road; and lodged at a little House in the Woods, about 35 Miles off where we lay last Night. The People were appris'd of my Coming, and got such Things as they had, in a decent Manner. We endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all the Divine Blessings with Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. I had a good deal of Discourse with the People of the House; and after much previous and suitable Conversation, I baptized two Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger's Children, who providentially lay at the same House that Night.—I believe there may be Hundreds of Children in this Province un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptised, for want of a Minister. <hi>Oh that the</hi> LORD <hi>would send forth some, who like</hi> John <hi>the Baptist, might preach, and baptize in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness!

Crossed <hi>Trent</hi> River, a Ferry about a half Mile wide; and got to an Ordinary, a little way off the Road, and about 33 Miles Stage, before six at Night: As soon as I came in, a young Man welcomed me into <hi>America,</hi> who,

This more and more convinces me, that the Negroes Children, if early brought up in the Nurture and Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the LORD, would make as great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It having rain'd almost the whole Night; the Swamps and Creeks which lay in the Way, were filled with Water: And the Bridges being out of Repair, rendered Travelling very dangerous. In one Place we were obliged to swim our Horses. In many, the Water was so very high that they could not be passed without much Difficulty. I was such a Coward, as to be sometimes a little fearful. GOD sent us two Guides, by whose Assistance we were carried thro' all, and brought at Night to a little House, where with Pleasure we reflected on the Dangers of the Day; and reminded one another of the unspeakable Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction we might expect hereafter, from a View of those many Crosses, Difficulties and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which we must necessarily endure whilst here on Earth. <hi>Oh that we may learn to endure any Pain, despise any Shame, submit to any Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, out of a believing Prospect of what we shall hereafter reap from them, when placed in Glory at the Right Hand of GOD.</hi>

It somewhat grieved me, that I could stay no longer; but being in Haste, we passed over a Half-Mile Ferry, and about sun-set came to a Tavern lying near five

Miles in the Province of <hi>South-Carolina.</hi> Here I immediately perceived the People were more polite than those we generally met with. But I believe the People of the House, at first, could have wished I had not come to be their Guest that Night: For it being <hi>New-Years-Day,</hi> several of the Neighbours were met together, in order to divert themselves by dancing Country Dances. By Advice of my Friends, I went in amongst them, while a Woman was Dancing a Jigg. At my first Entrance I endeavoured to shew the Folly of such Entertainments, and to convince her how well pleased the Devil was with every Step she took:—For some Time she endeavoured to out-brave me; neither the Fidler nor she desisted; but at last she gave over, and the Musician laid aside his Instrument. It would have made any one smile, to see how the Rest of the Company, one by one, attacked me, and brought, as they thought, Arguments to support their Wantonness. But CHRIST triumphed over <hi>Satan:</hi> They were all put to Silence; and were for some Time so over-awed, that after I had discoursed with them on the Nature of Baptism, the Necessity of being born again, in order to enjoy the Kingdom of Heaven; at their Entreaty, I baptized one of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and prayed afterwards, as I was enabled, and as the Circumstances of the Company required. Then I and my Companions took a little Refreshment. But the People were so bent on their Pleasure, that notwithstanding all that had been said, after I was gone to Bed, I heard

their Musick and Dancing; which made me look back on my own past Follies, with Shame and Confusion of Face; for such a one not long since, was I myself. <hi>LORD, for thy Mercies sake, shew all unhappy Formalists the same Favour, and suffer them not to go on in such a carnal Security till they lift up their Eyes in Torments.

We then thought it most adviseable, as we were in the main Road, to go on our Way, trusting to the Almighty to strengthen both our Beasts and us. We had not gone far, but we saw a Light;
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:004633_0096_100DB34092F564C0"/>
two of my Friends went up to it, and saw a Hut full of Negroes: They enquired after the Gentleman's House whither we were directed; but the Negroes seem'd surprized, and said they knew no such Man, and that they were but new Comers. From these Circumstances, one of my Friends inferr'd, that these Negroes might be some of those who lately had made an Insurrection in the Province, and were run away from their Masters. When he return'd, we were all of his Mind; and therefore thought it best to mend our Pace. Soon after we saw another great Fire near the Road Side; but imagining there was another Nest of such Negroes, we made a Circuit into the Woods.—One of my Friends, at a Distance, observed them Dancing round the Fire. The Moon shining bright, we soon found our Way into the great Road again; and after we had gone about a Dozen Miles, expecting to find Negroes in every Place, we came to a great Plantation, the Master of which, to our great Comfort, gave us Lodging and our Beasts Provender. Upon our relating the Circumstances of our Travels, he gave us Satisfaction about the Negroes; informed us whose they were, and upon what Occasion they were in those Places in which we found them. This afforded us much Comfort, after we had rode near Three-score Miles, and, as we thought, in great Peril of our Lives. <hi>Blessed be thy Name, O LORD, for this and all other thy Mercies through</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>our LORD.</hi>

Passed over a Three Mile Ferry, near <hi>George-Town:</hi> And, for the Ease of our Beasts, rode not above 18 Miles the whole Day. <hi>A good Man,</hi> says Solomon, <hi>is merciful to his Beast. How they will answer it at the great Day, who abuse the inferior Creatures, as tho' they had a License to use them as they please, I know not; sure I am, that for every such Abuse GOD will bring them into Judgment.</hi>

Passed over two Ferries in the Morning. Baited at Dinner-Time, after we had rode 18 Miles, and were then obliged to ride 25 Miles more, there being no proper Place to stay by the Way. About Eight in the Evening we came to a Tavern, within Eight Miles of <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> where we comfortably were refreshed with Food convenient for us. We had Family Prayer; and therein endeavoured to express our Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to GOD, for thus causing us to renew our Strength, and bringing us so near a Place where we would be. <hi>Oh! that our Hearts may be excited, more and more, to praise the LORD, for these and all other Mercies, which he daily pours down upon the unworthiest of the Sons of Men!</hi>

Went to the House of one Mr. <hi>L—re,</hi> where we dined, and were entertain'd with great Civility. In the Afternoon, several Gentlemen of the Town were so kind as to come and see me, and express'd a great Willingness to hear me preach. Letters and Papers were also brought me from <hi>New-York,</hi> informing me how mightily the Word of GOD grew and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed there. The Accounts in the <hi>English</hi> Papers of the War being daily carried on there, betwixt CHRIST and <hi>Belial,</hi> afforded us fresh Matter for Praising that GOD, who, we hoped, would in his Kingdom of Grace bring mighty Things to pass; while the World was buried in Wars and Rumours of Wars.—In the Evening I wrote some Letters to my <hi>English</hi> and <hi>New-York</hi> Friends.—Felt such Comfort within myself as the World cannot give, and verified what the Psalmist says, <hi>They shall be in perfect Peace, whose Minds are staid on thee.

<pb n="192" facs="unknown:004633_0098_100DB346B1A46F60"/>
But was grieved to find so little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in the Congregation after the Sermon was over. The Auditory was large, but very polite: And I question, whether the Court-End of the Town at <hi>London,</hi> could equal or exceed them in affected Finery and Gaiety of Dress: A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment ill becoming Persons who have had such Divine Judgments lately sent abroad amongst them: I reminded them of it in my Sermon; but I thought at first, I seem'd to them as one that mocked: This made me more importunate in secret Prayer; and I hoped GOD would let me see that he intended to Visit the Inhabitants with Mercy, as well as Judgment. For nothing is a greater sign of People's being harden'd, than their continuing unreformed under divine Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Thus it was with <hi>Pharoah</hi> and the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. LORD, for thy Mercies sake, let it not be the case of this People.</hi> Amen, <hi>LORD</hi> JESUS, Amen.</p>

Finding the Inhabitants were desirous to hear me a second Time, about eleven in the Morning I preached in the <hi>French</hi> Church; and blessed be GOD, saw a glorious Alteration in the Audience; which was so great that many stood without the Door. And I felt much more Freedom in myself, than I did yesterday. Many were melted into Tears; and one of the Town, the most remarkably gay, was observed to weep. And instead of the People's going out, as they did yesterday, in a light, airy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking Manner, a visible Concern was in most of their Faces, as tho' they could not resist the

Power, with which GOD enabled me to speak. <hi>Not unto me, O LORD, not unto me, but unto thy Name alone, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

GOD strengthened me to speak, I trust, as I ought to speak. In the Evening, I supped at another Merchant's House: where I had an Opportunity, for near t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

to fight at all.—Much of the Simplicity of Dress and Manners, which may be observed among the Inhabitants, I think, is in a great Measure owing to them. And I saw less of the Pride of Life in <hi>Pennsylvania</hi> than elsewhere: But it has happen'd to them, as it will to all other Religious Societies whatsoever, when they flourish and have the Upper-hand; I mean, many, for Profit's sake, have been known to dissemble with them; and I fear, Numbers amongst them, as amongst us, can give no other Reason why they are <hi>Quakers,</hi> than that their Fathers were so before them. I say this, because I find but little of a Divine Power stirring amongst them; and most of them are too st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In the City of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> they have two large Meeting-Houses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they assemble frequently together, and, all Things considered, are the most regular Society of Men in the World. Besides this, there is a <hi>Baptist</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Meeting.—I had the pleasure of being acquainted with the Ministers of both, and found there was some in their Congregations, particularly in that of the <hi>Baptists,</hi> who loved the LORD JESUS in Sincerity.

passed through, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> had larger Congregations than any of our Missionaries,—And we may guess how the Love of many of the <hi>Church of England</hi> in <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> must have waxed cold, because the Church, which has been begun, if I mistake not, some Years ago, is far from being finished within: However, many of late have been convinc'd what true Christianity is; and I hope a Party for JESUS CHRIST, will e'er long be selected out of the Members of our own Communion. The little Time I was at NEW-YORK would not permit me to make so many Observations, of the Situation of the Affairs of Religion in that Province, as otherwise I might have done.—A great Complaint was made to me, by some of the most serious Inhabitants, that it was a very secure Place, and that a Work of GOD had never be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Kingdom of GOD from amongst them:—But our LORD JESUS has been pleased to get himself the Victory; and tho' I was mostly opposed in <hi>New-York,</hi> yet if I may judge of what I saw myself, and have heard since my Departure, as much, if not more, Good has been done there, as in any other Place where I have been, for so short a Time.

England,</hi> which might, no doubt, greatly flourish, were their Ministers found faithful: But the Government, I fear, spoils them, by giving them too much Tobacco; for some, I hear, have 30,000, others 50,000, others 60,000 Pounds of Tobacco, <hi>per Annum.</hi> It is gathered by the High-Sheriff of the County, and every Taxable is obliged to pay 40 lb. of Tobacco yearly to the Ministers, tho' great Numbers never hear or see them. In VIRGINIA Matters are not quite so bad: The Ministers Stipends are not so large: The Commissary seems to have more Power, and to exercise more Discipline:—But almost all are quite settled upon their Lees; and I could not hear of any true vital Piety subsisting in that Province. In <hi>Maryland</hi> I was told of one Mr. <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In <hi>Virginia</hi> are no Dissenters from the establish'd Church, except one Meeting or two of <hi>Quakers.</hi> The Importation of so many Negroes and Convicts, is one great Reason why so little Religion is to be seen: But the main Cause of Irreligion, both in <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Maryland,</hi> I take to be their not Incorporating into Towns; for hereby People living at a Distance from the Church, are apt to make every little Thing serve as an Excuse, to keep them from publick Worship; Religious Societies cannot well be settled, and wicked Men may more easily revel and get drunk without contro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The greatest Probability of doing Good in <hi>Virginia,</hi> is among the <hi>Scotch-Irish,</hi> who have lately settled in the mountainous Parts of that Province; they raise little or no Tobacco, but Things that are useful for common Life: And I hear the Governor has given Leave for a Minister of their own Way of Thinking, to come whenever he can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. In NORTH-CAROLINA there's scarce so much as the Form of Religion. There are two Churches begun <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

There are several Dancing-Masters; but scarce one regularly settled Minister; so that in most Places they have Readers, who read a Sermon every <hi>Sunday</hi> to the People, who pay <hi>five Shillings</hi> a Quarter, of their Currency, which is <hi>Ten Shillings</hi> for <hi>One</hi> of Sterling.—However, the Government, I hear, has made Proposals to the <hi>Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts,</hi> to send Missionaries; but I should rather that People had no Ministers, than such as are generally sent over: And I cannot see the Charity of contributing towards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

I think there was a visible Difference as soon as we came into SOUTH-CAROLINA. The People there seem'd to study to be polite. They have many Ministers amongst them, both of our own and other Persuasions; but I hear of no stirring among the dry Bones. Mr. <hi>Garden,</hi> the present Commissary, is strict in the outward Discipline of the Church: The Clergy have an Annual Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Many of thy Inhabitants have left thee since we were here last; but still I hope Blessings are yet in reserve. Oh that thy Inhabitants would acquaint themselves with GOD, and be at Peace with him! Then wouldst thou be more than Conqueror over all thy Enemies.—Thus have I put down a few Thoughts that have occurred to my Mind. <hi>May GOD enlighten me where I am in the Dark, correct me where I am wrong, and bless this further Account of his Dealings with me, to the Conviction of Gain-sayers; the Comfort of Saints, and to the Edification of all that shall read it.
