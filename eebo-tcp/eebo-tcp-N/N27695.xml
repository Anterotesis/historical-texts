            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>AUSPICIOUS to the beſt hopes of Americans, for the univerſal ſucceſs of Republican liberty, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving year, 1800, preſents you with the periodical right of ſuffrage in the election of a Preſident of the U. States.</p>
            <p>The magnitude of this right, and the deep intereſts it involves for the fate and happineſs of our common country, demand your immediate, vigilant, unceaſing and deliberate attention. Impartial, firm and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, it remains with you to vindicate the rights of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican liberty, and to crown with ſucceſs the nobleſt and faireſt experiment the world has ever yet ſeen, attempted by freemen, to eſtabliſh ſelf-government.</p>
            <p>The probationary period of ten years, ſince the inſtitution of a foederal government, affords much ground to hope and fear, amidſt that continued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of nations which ſtill agitates the European world, and threatens to involve our weſtern hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere in its ruinous vortex. Your ſacrifices for peace and the virtuous efforts of your republican ſons, have, hitherto preſerved you from the fatal curſe and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity of war.</p>
            <p>Purſuing, with miſled confidence, the meaſures of men, whoſe hoſtility to the fundamental principles of your government, conceived the only hope of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:036917_0003_100B324A4FD0F728"/>amidſt ſcenes of war and confuſion, you have been placed, more than once, on the precipice of deſtruction. Seceding from the principles avowed to the world as the baſis of your republican inſtitutions, the pillars of ariſtocracy have ariſen, and in the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of American truths, the world has been aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at your <hi>retrograde</hi> turn and rapid advance to monarchy.</p>
            <p>A review of paſt events will but preſent the painful ſpectacle of political apoſtacy, amidſt the wreck of principle: and the creation of ſyſtems equally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of liberty, peace and happineſs— Suffice it to ſay, that new and unheard of doctrines have been advanced, precedents eſtabliſhed, and laws enacted, which go to ſap the very foundations of public liberty —Hence have we ſeen, in the abandonment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional truth and principle, conſtructive treaſon avowed, and the right of trial by jury of the vicinage exploded in our courts of juſtice, whilſt our legiſlative acts have begotten new and arbitrary principles of alieniſm and ſedition, with an extended and boundleſs ſyſtem of common law, adopted by a foreign nation, and never yet incorporated into any American code. And our executive functionaries have not been ſlothful in purſuing, under colour of law, perſecutions and proſcriptions of perſonal diſqualifications for political opinions, and reſtraints on the liberty of the preſs— Or in promoting, by every faculty they poſſeſſed, ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems of extended influence and waſteful expenditure, to the creation of heavy and oppreſſive public burdens, in numerous and unneceſſary appointments to office, a ſtanding army, a permanent navy, augmentation of public debt, loans at exceſſive and exorbitant intereſt, and finally, additional and aggravated impoſt duties, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, ſalt tax and land tax.</p>
            <p>But, fellow-citizens, if in addition to this dark ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of public evils, you are told from he mouth of the now Preſident of the U. S. that "REPUBLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CAN GOVERNMENT MAY BE INTERPRETED TO MEAN ANY THING;" that "THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION IS, IN THE STRICTEST SENSE, A REPUBLIC;" that "AN
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:036917_0004_100B324C489BCBE0"/>HEREDITARY PRESIDENT AND SENATE FOR LIFE, CAN ALONE SECURE YOU HAPPINESS;" and that in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict of political opinions which prevail in our country, "IT IS ADMISSIBLE FOR ONE FACTION TO SEIZE THE PERSONS OF THEIR OPPONENTS AND TRANSFER THEM WITHIN THE LINES OF AN INVADING ENEMY;" —<hi>When</hi> and <hi>where</hi> will you look for relief?</p>
            <p>Heaven has wiſely ordered, that on your own vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous efforts alone, ſhall it depend, to diſavow the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, revoke the meaſures, and diſcard the men, that have thus afflicted you. Happy, in the poſſeſſion of a citizen, to whom, under God, America is principally indebted for that ſhare of political well-being ſhe now enjoys—JEFFERSON, mild, amiable, and philanthropic, refined in manners as enlightened in mind, the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher of the world, whoſe name adds luſtre to our national character, and as a legiſlator and ſtateſman, ſtands ſecond to no man's—<hi>Jefferſon, yet lives.</hi> On him then concentre your preſent views and your future hopes.</p>
            <p>Illuſtrious by an active life, of great and conſiſtent efforts to promote the univerſal eſtabliſhment of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican liberty, and the permanent happineſs of the great family of mankind, he will neither diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point your hopes nor defeat your wiſhes. Look into his paſt life, examine all his conduct, and if you can diſcover one inſtance of political apoſtacy, or the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relection of a republican principle, then withhold from him your confidence and your ſuffrages.</p>
            <p>Neither ſuffer yourſelves to be deceived by the calumnious efforts of electioneering partizans, the real enemies of America, to depreciate the moral and political character of the man whoſe name ſhould be dear to every republican heart. It is through the turpitude of thoſe enemies, that the pure virtues and pre-eminent talents of Jefferſon ſtand reflected, with undiminiſhed luſtre, and preſent him to the world as the friend and benefactor of the human race. See the teſtimony of the venerable judge Pendleton, preſident of the Virginia convention, as recorded in the debates of that convention, pages 100 and 101, on the queſtion
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036917_0005_100B324E782F9350"/>for adopting the foederal conſtitution, who ſpeaks in the following emphatic words: <q>I know and highly reſpect the great abilities of Mr. Jefferſon—Providence has, for the happineſs of mankind, accompanied thoſe abilities with a diſpoſition to make uſe of them for the good of his fellow-beings.</q> Honourable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial of an aged and veteran ſtateſman, who could contemplate with pleaſure the ſupport and patronage he had yeilded to the youthful virtues and riſing talents of Jefferſon, in early life—a teſtimonial as honourable to him that gave, as to him that received it.</p>
            <p>But reſting on the ſame high and reſpected authority of judge Pendleton, ſee what he further ſays in the ſame debate, in reply to the artful inſinuation then made, that Mr. Jefferſon, who was at that time abſent as miniſter of the United States in France, had written ſentiments hoſtile to the adoption of the foederal conſtitution, and adviſing its rejection.— <q>I have ſeen, ſays Mr. Pendle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, the letter in which Mr. Jefferſon has written his opinion upon this ſubject—It appears that he is poſſeſſed of that conſtitution, and has in his mind the idea of amending it—He has in his mind the very queſtion of ſubſequent or previous amendments, which is now under conſideration. His ſentiments on this ſubject are as follow: 'I wiſh with all my ſoul that the firſt nine conventions may accept the new conſtitution, becauſe it will ſecure to us the good it contains, which I think great and important. I wiſh the four lateſt, whichever they be, may refuſe to accede to it, 'till amendments are ſecured.'—He then enumerates the amendments which he wiſhes to be ſecured, and adds—'We muſt take care however that neither this, nor any other objection to the form, produce a ſchiſm in our union. That would be an incurable evil; becauſe friends falling out never cordially reunite.' Are theſe ſentiments, (aſks Mr. Pendleton) in favour of thoſe who wiſh to prevent its adoption by previous amendment? He wiſhes the firſt nine ſtates to adopt it—What are his reaſons? Becauſe it will ſecure to us the good it contains, which he thinks great and important, and he wiſhes
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036917_0006_100B324FF9F6F570"/>the other four may refuſe it, becauſe he thinks it will tend to obtain neceſſary amendments—But he would not wiſh that a ſchiſm ſhould take place in the union <hi>on any conſideration.</hi> If then we are to be influenced by his opinion at all, we will ratify it, and ſecure thereby the good it contains.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Republican citizens of America, will you believe it, and ſhall the groundleſs calumny yet find currency in our land, that Jefferſon is an antifederaliſt and enemy to the conſtitution of the U. States? Reflect, and aſk yourſelves, whether, if in the prophetic ſpirit that dictated his remarks on the conſtitution, as before quoted, the convention of four ſtates had refuſed to accede to it, until amendments were obtained, you would probably now have cauſe to regret the exiſtence in your country of an alien and ſedition law, of the lately adopted doctrine of conſtructive treaſon, and above all, of the ruinous and diſgraceful treaty with Great-Britain?</p>
            <p>Equally repulſive to the malign ſuggeſtion that Mr. Jefferſon is an enemy to religion, the public records of his native ſtate, preſent to the world in the ſtatute book of their laws, the celebrated act "for eſtabliſhing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious freedom"—drawn by the pen, and offered to the aſſembly of Virginia, by the hand of their enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and illuſtrious fellow-citizen: Read, ye fanatics, bigots, and religious hypocrites, of whatſoever clime or country ye be—and you, baſe calumniators, whoſe efforts to traduce are the involuntary tribute of envy to a character more pure and perfect than your own, read, learn, and practiſe the RELIGION OF JEFFERSON, as diſplayed in the ſublime truths and inſpired language of HIS ever memorable "Act for eſtabliſhing religious freedom," thus:—</p>
            <p>"WELL aware that Almighty God hath created the mind free; that all attempts to influence it by temporal puniſhments or burdens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocriſy and meanneſs, and are a departure from the plan of the Holy Author of our religion, who being Lord both of body and mind, yet choſe not to propagate it by coercions on
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036917_0007_100B3251907D5FE0"/>either, as was in his Almighty power to do; that the impious preſumption of legiſlators and rulers, civil as well as eccleſiaſtical, who, being themſelves but fallible and uninſpired men, have aſſumed dominion over the faith of others, ſetting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true and infallible, and as ſuch endeavouring to impoſe them on others, hath eſtabliſhed and maintained falſe religions over the greateſt part of the world, and through all time; that to compel a man to furniſh contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he diſbelieves, is ſinful and tyrannical; that even the forcing him to ſupport this or that teacher of his own religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions to the particular paſtor, whoſe morals he would make his pattern, and whoſe powers he feels moſt perſuaſive to righteouſneſs, and is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from the miniſtry thoſe temporary rewards, which proceeding from an approbation of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal conduct, are an additional incitement to earneſt and unremitting labours for the inſtruction of mankind; that our civil rights have no dependence on our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious opinions, more than our opinions in phyſics or geometry; that therefore the proſcribing any citizen as unworthy the public confidence, by laying upon him an incapacity of being called to offices of truſt and emolument, unleſs he profeſs or renounce this or that religious opinion, is depriving him injuriouſly of thoſe privileges and advantages, to which, in common with his fellow-citizens, he has a natural right; that it tends alſo to corrupt the principles of that very religion it is meant to encourage, by bribing with a monopoly of worldly honours and emoluments, thoſe who will externally profeſs and conform to it; that though indeed theſe are criminal who do not withſtand ſuch temptation, yet neither are thoſe innocent who lay the bait in their way; that to ſuffer the civil magiſtrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion, and to reſtrain the profeſſion or propagation of principles on ſuppoſition of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which at once deſtroys all religious liberty, becauſe he being of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036917_0008_100B32541B5A7CB8"/>courſe judge of that tendency, will make his opinions. the rule of judgment, and approve or condemn the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of others only as they ſhall ſquare with or differ from his own; that it is time enough for the rightful purpoſes of civil government, for its officers to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere when principles break out into overt acts againſt, peace and good order; and finally, that truth is great, and will prevail if left to herſelf: that ſhe is the proper and ſufficient antagoniſt to error, and has nothing to fear from the conflict, unleſs by human interpoſition diſarmed of her natural weapons, free argument and debate, errors ceaſing to be dangerous when it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted freely to contradict them:</p>
            <p>"<hi>Be it therefore enacted by the General Aſſembly</hi>—That no man ſhall be compelled to frequent or ſupport any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worſhip, place, or miniſtry whatſoever, nor ſhall be enforced, reſtrained, moleſted or burdened in his body or goods, nor ſhall otherwiſe ſuffer on account of his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions opinions or belief; but that all men ſhall be free to profeſs, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the ſame ſhall in no wiſe diminiſh, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.</p>
            <p>"And though we well know that this aſſembly, elected by the people for the ordinary purpoſes of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation only, have no power to reſtrain the acts of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding aſſemblies, conſtituted with powers equal to our own, and that therefore to declare this act to be irrevocable, would be of no effect in law; yet we are free to declare, and do declare, that the rights hereby aſſerted, are of the natural rights of mankind, and that if any act ſhall be hereafter paſſed to repeal the preſent, or to narrow its operation, ſuch act will be an infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of natural right."</p>
            <p>Further, if the opponents of Mr. Jefferſon require additional proof of the <hi>ardent piety</hi> and <hi>religious fervour</hi> of his mind, let them read in his "Notes on Virginia," page 237, his reflections on the ſubject of ſlavery, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of his wiſhes for a <hi>gradual</hi> emancipation, which are concluded by the following pious apoſtrophe. <q>Can the liberties of a nation be thought ſecure when we have removed their only firm baſis, a conviction in
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036917_0009_100B325733674958"/>the minds of the people <hi>that theſe liberties are of the gift of God?</hi> That they are not to be violated but with <hi>his</hi> wrath? <hi>Indeed I tremble for my country</hi> when I reflect <hi>that God is juſt: that his juſtice cannot ſleep forever:</hi> that conſidering numbers, nature and natural means only, a revolution of the wheel of fortune, an exchange of ſituation is among poſſible events: that it may become probable by ſupernatural interference! <hi>The Almighty</hi> has no attribute which can take ſide with us in ſuch a conteſt.—But it is impoſſible to be temperate and to purſue this ſubject through the various conſiderations of policy, of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, of hiſtory, natural and civil. We muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to hope they will force their way into every one's mind. I think a change already perceptible ſince the origin of the <hi>preſent [American]</hi> revolution. The ſpirit of the maſter is abating, that of the ſlave riſing from the duſt; his condition mollifying, <hi>the way I hope preparing, under the auſpices of heaven,</hi> for a total emancipation, and that this is diſpoſed <hi>in the order of events,</hi> to be with <hi>the conſent of the maſters, rather</hi> than by their <hi>extirpation.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Again, in the ſame Notes, page 240, evincing his anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety to cultivate a ſpirit of genuine virtue in the public mind, as the ſure preſervative of republican liberty, he expreſſes a no leſs exalted ſentiment of the cultivators of the ſoil, the yeomanry of our country, than a juſt confidence in the order of providence to perpetuate, through them, the ſacred flame of moral and religious virtue.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Thoſe, ſays Jefferſon, who labour in the earth are the choſen people of God; if ever he had a choſen people, whoſe breaſts he has made his peculiar depoſit for ſubſtantial and genuine virtue. It is the focus in which he keeps alive that ſacred fire, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might eſcape from the face of the earth. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of morals in the maſs of cultivators is a phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon of which no age nor nation has furniſhed an example. It is the mark ſet on thoſe, who <hi>not looking up to heaven,</hi> to their own ſoil and induſtry <hi>as does the huſbandman,</hi> for their ſubſiſtence, depend
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036917_0010_100B3258B48F2788"/>for it on the caſualties and caprice of cuſtomers. Dependance begets ſubſervience and venality, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focates the germ of virtue, and prepares fit tools for the deſigns of ambition.—It is the manners and ſpirit of a people which preſerve a republic in vigour. A degeneracy in theſe is a canker which ſoon eats to the heart of its laws and conſtitution.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But is there not yet another accuſation produced by the <hi>calumniators</hi> of this good man, which the recorded teſtimonial of his country's approbation, alſo refutes? Namely, that while he was governor of Virginia, in the year 1781, during Arnold's invaſion of that ſtate, he ſhamefully fled before a handful of light horſe, and left the capital of the ſtate, Richmond, to be pillaged and plundered by the enemy. If indeed it were true that Mr. Jefferſon had been thus timid and faithleſs to his public truſt. no man will believe that the Legiſlature of Virginia were ignorant of the circumſtances, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of his conduct.—Accordingly it will be found in the proceedings of the Virginia Legiſlature of the 12th of December, 1781, that that aſſembly, having all the circumſtances of Mr. Jefferſon's conduct before them and within their knowledge, reſpecting that inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>unanimouſly</hi> reſolved, <q>That the thanks of the General Aſſembly be given to Thomas Jefferſon, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> for his <hi>attentive adminiſtration</hi> of the powers of the Executive, whilſt in office.</q>

            <p>In addition, if the <hi>unanimous</hi> teſtimony of the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature be not, in the opinion of his calumniators, moſt concluſive, it will be ſeen in the Gazette of the United States, publiſhed at Philadelphia, by John Fenno, that on the 26th of October, 1796, when the ſame ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs calumny was brought forward in that gazette, againſt Mr. Jefferſon, for the ſame purpoſe that it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     <salute>MR. FENNO,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I obſerve ſome ſhameful miſtatements of the writer in your Gazette under the ſignature of Phocion, reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the conduct of Mr. Jefferſon, while governor of Virginia, in the year 1781, and having been perſonally preſent, in actual ſervice, through all the active ſcenes of that year, from its commencement and before, until after the termination of the ſiege of York, I can ſtate what that conduct really was, with more truth and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty than either Phocion or his friend Charles Simms, neither of whom appear to know much about what they have written, and were, to my knowledge, neither of them in Virginia at the period referred to. Firſt, then it is not true that "Mr. Jefferſon <hi>abandoned his truſt at the moment of invaſion.</hi>"—Arnold's invaſion took place in January, 1781: Mr. Jefferſon remained in his ſtation through the whole period of that invaſion. Cornwallis's invaſion took place in April, 1781, and he continued to advance into the country until the beginning of June, when he commenced his retreat before the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis Fayette, into the lower country, on the ſeaboard; the marquis having taken the command about two months before. Mr. Jefferſon did not reſign at all, or abandon his ſtation; he remained in office until after Cornwallis's retreat, and until the time for which he was conſtitutionally elected had expired; to wit, the 12th of June, 1781. Before he left this office, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Mr. Jefferſon demanded of the Legiſlature, a full enquiry into the conduct of the Executive for the laſt twelve months; which was accordingly granted by their reſolution of the 12th of June, 1781; and the 26th of November following appointed for the enquiry—being a period of near ſix months allowed to bring forward any charges or proofs againſt Mr. Jefferſon.—On the 26th of December, 1781, the Aſſembly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to take up the enquiry at large, on the report of a committee of their own body; and having firſt voted that no charge or accuſation whatever appeared againſt Mr. Jefferſon, and that there never was any cauſe for the enquiry but ſome vague and groundleſs rumours, they paſſed the reſolution of the 12th De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036917_0012_100B325C6EFB2150"/>1781, already publiſhed in your paper (Mr. Fenno), and which if Phocion's candour will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him again to read, he will find not merely an acknowledgment of Mr. Jefferſon's ability and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and <hi>altogether ſilent on the want of firmneſs,</hi> but containing an unanimous and expreſs vote of thanks for <hi>his attentive adminiſtration of the powers of the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive, whilſt in office.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Mr. Fenno, it is not true that Mr. Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at any time fled before a few light horſemen, and ſhamefully abandoned his truſt, or, as ſuggeſted by Charles Simms, contributed by his conduct to the loſs and diſtreſs which accrued to the ſtate, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of public records and vouchers for general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penditure.—Let facts ſpeak: In four days from the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of Arnold's fleet, he proceeded 150 miles up James river, and landed his troops within 24 miles of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, the night before his march to that place: all the militia of the ſtate, which could be armed, being then out under the command of general Nelſon, in the neighbourhood of Williamſburg, and no defence at hand for the ſecurity of Richmond but about 200 half-armed militia, under the command of baron Steuben, who could do nothing more than cover the removal of the records and military ſtores acroſs James river, from Richmond to Mancheſter, and ſecure the boats and batteaus on the Mancheſter ſide, to prevent the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's paſſing. The writer of this remained in Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond with the laſt detachment of militia that paſſed the river with records and ſtores, and until the enemy, about 9 o'clock in the morning, had entered the lower part of the town and began to flank it with their light horſe, he ſaw Mr. Jefferſon as active as man could be, as well the night before as that morning, iſſuing his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and uſing every exertion to remove the records and ſtores. He afterwards ſaw him at Weſtham, five miles above Richmond, where Arnold puſhed a detachment to deſtroy the ſtores at that place, and which, through Mr. Jefferſon's exertions, were almoſt entirely ſaved. The next day, when the enemy evacuated Richmond, the firſt man the writer of this ſaw, as he entered the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036917_0013_100B325EEA7E2C80"/>town, was Mr. Jefferſon. Let a candid public then determine whether conduct like this, to which the writer hereof was an eye witneſs, manifeſted want of firmneſs or an abandonment of truſt. The ſituation of the ſtate was at that time peculiarly diſtreſſing; the whole quota of its continental troops were then acting in South-Carolina; many thouſand ſtand of arms had been ſupplied for the defence of North-Carolina, and Arnold's invaſion found the ſtate almoſt totally defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. The ſtate of things was little better a few months afterwards, when Cornwallis's invaſion happened, and the marquis Fayette took the command; ſince it is well known that through the whole of that campaign the marquis could never muſter more than three or four thouſand militia, badly armed, in aid of the few conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental troops that were detached from the northern army, to Virginia. Such was the deplorable ſituation both of the ſtate and continent, for want of arms. In reſpect to Tarleton's ſudden march to Charlotteville, during that campaign, in order to ſurpriſe the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and aſſembly, it will be remembered, that the marquis's army was inferior to Cornwallis's, and had few or no cavalry attached to it; that at Charlotteville there was not even a ſingle company of militia, and that Tarlton made a rapid march, of about 60 miles through the country, at the head of about 500 cavalry. The writer of this was alſo preſent at Charlotteville at the time, and ſaw Mr. Jefferſon and his Executive Council attending their duty at that place, with the Aſſembly: it will not be pretended then, under the circumſtances ſtated, that Mr. Jefferſon <q>
                        <hi>fled before a few light horſemen, and ſhamefully abandoned his truſt,</hi>
                     </q> as <hi>ſhamefully</hi> aſſerted by Phocion.</p>
                  <p>But, Mr. Fenno, why do the enemies of Mr. Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cavil <hi>alone</hi> at his honourable acquittal by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Virginia, from groundleſs and unfounded charges? they well know that at the end of that very year, his brave and gallant ſucceſſor in office, general Nelſon, was ſubjected to public accuſation and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment before the Aſſembly, for ſuppoſed miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in office, and honourably acquitted by the ſame
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036917_0014_100B3260E3E1C698"/>body, in the ſame preciſe manner, and with an unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous vote of thanks, as in the caſe of Mr. Jefferſon. No proof appeared againſt either; the accuſation in each was declared to be groundleſs, and the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reputation of both ſtand or fall by the verdict of the ſame body. I leave it with a candid public to form their own reflections.</p>

            <p>There yet remain two other calumnies againſt the much-abuſed character of Mr. Jefferſon, which require notice. They were both ſuggeſted in the year 1792, on the eve of a preſidential election, and again in the year 1796, on a ſimilar occaſion, and are now revived; to wit,
<list>
                  <item>1ſt, That when miniſter of the United States to France, in the year 1787, he made a diſhonourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Congreſs, reſpecting a transfer of the debt due by the United States to France, to a Dutch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</item>
                  <item>2dly, That he was a debtor to Britiſh merchants before the revolutionary war, and purſued meaſures to defraud his creditors.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Unhappily for his calumniators, both theſe charges have been proved to be perfectly groundleſs, and to have originated only in the wickedneſs and malice of his enemies.</p>
            <p>The firſt charge was publiſhed in the year 1792, in Fenno's Gazette, and given, as believed, from the treaſury department of the United States, on whoſe books Mr. Jefferſon's letter to Congreſs reſpecting the French debt, was recorded. The then head of that department was roundly accuſed, in the public prints of that year, with miſrepreſentation and the breach of an official duty, in cauſing or permitting to be publiſhed from the treaſury books, for the purpoſe of aiding the calumny againſt Mr. Jefferſon, a mutilated copy of his letter to Congreſs, leaving out two entire paragraphs of it, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſenſe of the part publiſhed, by ſubſtituting words not in the original. This accuſation was evaded, but never diſproved before the public, and it remains a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036917_0015_100B32626D445930"/>and incontrovertible truth, that the letter was publiſhed, ſo mutilated.</p>
            <p>The facts in relation to that letter are briefly theſe: Mr Jefferſon informs congreſs, that an offer had been made by a ſpeculating Dutch company to the French court, to purchaſe the American debt due to that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at a diſcount of ſix or eight million of livres; to which offer, when communicated by the French miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to Mr. Jefferſon, for his approbation, he replied that he had no power to approve or diſapprove; to the agent of the Dutch company, who made the ſame appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, he returned a ſimilar anſwer; and in his letter to congreſs, preſuming that the Dutch agent would make application to that body, he ſtates the reflection, <q>how far, if congreſs apprehend any future danger of the punctuality of payment, it might be adviſeable to transfer the diſcontents ariſing from that ſource, from the French court, whoſe friendſhip we ought to cultivate, to the breaſts of a <hi>private company</hi> of <hi>adventuring ſpeculators,</hi> who foreſeeing the poſſible delays of payment, had calculated the probable loſs, and were willing to encounter the hazard.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Two other paragraphs follow; to wit, "That in his (Mr. Jefferſon's) opinion, however, the honour and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit <q>of the United States may be preſerved inviolate: that the French debt may be diſcharged <hi>without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> or <hi>loſs</hi> to that nation, and the ſtipulations of the United States be complied with, to all its cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors.</q> And he then ſuggeſts to congreſs the mode of doing it.</p>
            <p>The enemies of Mr. Jefferſon publiſhed this letter, leaving out the two laſt paragraphs, and changing the ſenſe of the firſt in the manner that has been ſtated.</p>
            <p>On the whole letter a ſingle reflection is ſubmitted, Whether in any inſtance of public conduct Mr. Jefferſon could have more juſtly appreciated the duty of a public miniſter, or more happily combined it with the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious and moral ſenſe of public and private integrity?</p>
            <p>The ſecond charge, "That Mr. Jefferſon was a debtor to Britiſh merchants, before the revolutionary war, and purſued meaſures to defraud his creditors," is refuted
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:036917_0016_100B3265143F9418"/>and diſproved, in a manner highly honourable to Mr. Jefferſon's reputation, by a publication of the 5th of April laſt, made in Philadelphia, by a gentleman who took particular pains to inveſtigate the ſubject; and is as followeth:</p>
            <div type="account">
               <head>ACCOUNT OF MR. JEFFERSON'S <hi>BRITISH DEBTS.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>It is the fate of every man whoſe virtue and talents have elevated him in ſociety, to excite the envy and hatred of many; among perſons thus diſpoſed, ſome are imperceptibly carried into error, others are deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly criminal.—The ſteady induſtry diſplayed by the aſſailants of virtue exceeds infinitely that of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders; and unfortunately, the meditated injury has its full effect before the perſon accuſed is aware of it, and inſtead of parrying the blow he has the wound to heal. In this ſituation of things, ſo rare is benevolence to be found amongſt us, ſo little intereſt do we generally take in the welfare of our fellow-men, that we are apt to imagine we have diſcharged our duty when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our belief of the innocence of the accuſed, and content ourſelves under the ſelf-approbation, that we have done nothing to injure the feelings of the ſufferer.</p>
               <p>The evils to ſociety which we permit to remain, without our utmoſt exertions to remove, may anſwer well enough with people who are <hi>negatively good,</hi> or who believe that virtue conſiſts in abſtaining from evil: I think differently: and thinking as I do, will never permit the people to be duped by falſe accuſations le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled againſt their moſt meritorious and deſerving ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. If in the charges, which, from my beſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I am obliged to make againſt public characters, I paſs into error, the principle which governs me, ought alſo to draw forth an advocate for truth and virtue, on the oppoſite ſide of the queſtion.</p>
               <p>For ſome time paſt, a great clamour has been made through the United States, reſpecting debts due from Mr. Jefferſon, to Britiſh merchants: I have taken ſome trouble to inform myſelf upon this ſubject, and I confeſs, that although I did not believe the charge to be correct, as to the idea which it was intended to convey of that
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036917_0017_100B32678FFFB400"/>gentleman's honour; I had no conception, that his enemies would be driven to attack him upon a ſubject, which, if fairly examined, would add ſo conſiderably to the luſtre of his character.</p>
               <p>In the year 1774, before a ſhilling of paper money had been iſſued, Mr. Jefferſon ſold about five thouſand acres of land in Cumberland and Bedford counties, to pay his proportion of a debt due from the eſtate of Mr. Wayles to Farrel and Jones. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the bonds to their agent immediately, who refuſed to take them. The money was paid to Mr. Jefferſon in 1779 and 1780, and he carried it to the treaſury of Virginia, as the laws preſſed on all to do, who owed money to Britiſh ſubjects; declaring that the public would pay it over, dollar for dollar. This deluſion ſoon paſſed away, and it became evident, that the public neither could nor ought to pay according to the nominal value. The reader will perceive the loſs which Mr. Jefferſon ſuſtained, and that if he had been diſpoſed to quibble, no event could have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded him a more plauſible pretext: But it appears that this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman conſidered himſelf ſtill anſwerable to Farrel and Jones, and therefore ſettled with their agent otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>The next debt in ſucceſſion, was one due to Kippen and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, for whom Mr. Lyle, of Mancheſter, was agent. I called upon that gentleman for information reſpecting Mr. Jefferſon's conduct in the ſettlement of this claim, who aſſured me that it was ſtrictly honourable. Mr. Lyle told me that as ſoon as the Vice Preſident returned from his miſſion to France, he waited upon him, and made immediate arrangements for payment, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting the 8 years war intereſt.</p>
               <p>Concerning the war intereſt, I think the annexed letter from Mr. Jefferſon, will be quite ſatisfactory. But excluſive of his particular ſituation, and the loſſes which he ſuſtained, probably from his conſpicuous ſervices during the revolutionary conteſt; I know of not a ſolitary inſtance in which the eight years intereſt has been paid, if objected to by the defendant's counſel; and I fancy it was the opinion of the federal judges aſſembled in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, that the war intereſt ought to be deducted, if a ſpecial reaſon for avoiding it could be aſſigned—and ſurely no reaſon could be aſſigned with more forcible propriety, than that the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh themſelves had deſtroyed the means. But, to my mind, there is the beſt evidence of the equity of withholding the eight years intereſt; the juries have uniformly deducted it, although the counſel for the plaintiff has often aſſigned peculiar and ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſpringing from the manner in which the debt originated, why it ſhould be allowed.</p>
               <p>The following letter from Mr. Jefferſon, while in Paris, is now ſubmitted to the public. It was not procured from him, but having been produced in court by Jones's agent, in another
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036917_0018_100B32698C391EB0"/>caſe, was by the counſel of that agent candidly and honourably read in court as an act of juſtice to Mr. Jefferſon; get thus into the preſs, and has ſince been uſed by the advocates for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Britiſh debts, and by them, very much complimented.<note n="*" place="bottom">We add, from unqueſtionable authority, that ſoon after Mr. Jefferſon's return from France, arrangements were made with the agent of Farrel and Jones, and a depoſit placed in his hands, to the amount of the claim againſt Mr. Jefferſon.</note>

                     <p>When I had the pleaſure of ſeeing you in London, I mentioned to you that the affairs of Mr. Wayles's eſtate, were left to be ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately ſettled by Mr. Eppes, the only acting executor; that I have left in his hands alſo, and in thoſe of a Mr. Lewis, the part of Mr. Wayles's eſtate which came to me, together with my own: that they were firſt to clear off ſome debts which had been neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily contracted during the war, and would after that apply the whole profits to the payment of my part of Mr. Wayles's debt to you, and to a debt of mine to Kippen and company of Glaſgow.—Being anxious to begin the payment of theſe two debts, and finding that it would be too long poſtponed if the reſiduary ones were to be paid merely from the annual profits of the eſtate; a number of ſlaves have been ſold, and I have lately received infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from Meſſrs. Eppes and Lewis, that the proceeds of that ſale, with the profits of the eſtate to the end of 1781. would pay off the whole of the reſiduary debts.—As we are now, therefore, clear of embarraſſment to purſue our principal object; I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of arranging with you, ſuch juſt and practicable conditions, as will aſcertain to you, the terms at which you will receive my part of your debt, and give me the ſatisfaction of knowing that you are contented.—What the laws of Virginia are, or may be, will in no wiſe influence my conduct.—Subſtantial juſtice is my object, as decided by reaſon, and not by authority or compulſion.</p>
                     <p>The firſt queſtion which ariſes, is, as to the article of intereſt. For all the time preceding the war and all ſubſequent to it, I think it reaſonable that intereſt ſhould be paid; but equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable during the war. Intereſt is a compenſation for the uſe of money.—Your money in my hands, is in the form of lands and negroes. From theſe during the war, no uſe, no profits, could be derived. Tobacco is the article they produce; that only can be turned into money at a foreign market. But the moment it went out of our ports for that purpoſe, it was captured either by the king's ſhips, or by thoſe of individuals. The conſequence was, that tobacco worth from twenty to thirty ſhillings the hundred,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:036917_0019_100B326B2F7385A0"/>ſold generally in Virginia, during the war, for five ſhillings—this price it is known will not maintain the labourer and pay his taxes. There was no ſurplus of profit then to pay an intereſt. In the mean while we ſtood inſurers of the lives of the labourers, and of the ultimate iſſue of the war. He who attempted during the war to remit either his principal or intereſt, muſt have expected to remit three times, to make one payment; becauſe it is ſuppoſed, that two out of three parts of the ſhipments were taken. It was not poſſible then for the debtor, to derive any profit from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which might enable him to pay an intereſt, nor yet to get rid of the principal by remitting it to his creditor. With reſpect to creditors in Great Britain, they turned their attention to priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teering, and arming the veſſels they had before employed in trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with us; they captured on the ſeas, not only the produce of the farms of their debtors, but of thoſe of the whole ſtate. They thus paid themſelves by capture more than their annual intereſt; and we loſt more. Some merchants indeed did not engage in privateering; theſe loſt their intereſt, but <hi>we</hi> did not gain it; it fell into the hands of their countrymen. It cannot therefore be demanded of us. As between theſe merchants and their debtors, it is the caſe where, a loſs being incurred, each party may juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably endeavour to ſhift it from himſelf; each has an equal right to avoid it; one party can never expect the other to yield a thing, to which he has as good a right as the demander: we even think, he has a better right than the demander in the preſent inſtance. This loſs has been occaſioned by the fault of the nation which was creditor. Our right to avoid it then ſtands on leſs excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable ground than theirs. But it will be ſaid, that each party thought the other the aggreſſor—in theſe diſputes, there is but one umpire, and that has decided the queſtion, where the world in general thought the right lay.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe reaſons in favour of the general maſs of debtors, I have ſome peculiar to my own caſe. In the year 1776, before a ſhilling of paper money was iſſued I ſold lands to the amount of £. 4,200, in order to pay theſe two debts. I offered the bonds of the purchaſers to your agent, Mr. Evans, if he would acquit me, and accept of the purchaſers as debtors, in my place. They were as ſure as myſelf; had he done it, theſe debts being turned over to you, would have been ſaved to you by the treaty of peace. But he declined it. Great ſums of paper money were afterwards iſſued; this depreciated, and payment was made me in this money, when it was but a ſhadow. Our laws do not entitle their own fellow citizens to require re-payment in theſe caſes, though the treaty authoriſes the Britiſh creditor to do it. Here then I loſt the principal and intereſt once.—Again, Lord Cornwallis en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped ten days on an eſtate of mine at Elk Iſland, having his
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036917_0020_100B326DC2695328"/>head-quarters in my houſe. He burned all the tobacco houſes and barns on the farm, with the produce of the former year in them; he burnt all the encloſures, and waſted the fields in which the crop of that year was growing (it was in the month of June): he killed or carried off every living animal, cutting the throats of thoſe which were too young for ſervice. Of the ſlaves, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away thirty. The uſeleſs and barbarous injury he did me in that inſtance, was more than would have paid your debt, principal and intereſt: Thus I loſt it a ſecond time. Still I will lay my ſhoulders aſſiduouſly to the payment of it a third time; in doing this, however, I think yourſelf will be of opinion, I am authoriſed, in juſtice, to clear it of every article not demandable in ſtrict right: of this nature I conſider intereſt during the war.</p>
                     <p>Another queſtion is, as to the paper money I depoſited in the treaſury of Virginia, towards the diſcharge of this debt. I before obſerved, that I had ſold lands to the amount of £. 4,200 before a ſhilling of paper money was emitted, with a view to pay this debt. I received this money in depreciated paper. The ſtate was then calling on thoſe who owed money to Britiſh ſubjects to bring it into the treaſury, engaging to pay a like ſum to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor at the end of the war. I carried the identical money there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the treaſury, where it was applied, as all the money of the ſame deſcription was, to the ſupport of the war. Subſequent events have been ſuch, that the ſtate cannot, and ought not to pay the ſame nominal ſum in gold or ſilver, which they received in paper: nor is it certain what they will do. My intention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and having always been, that whatever the ſtate decides, you ſhall receive my part of your debt fully. I am ready to remove all difficulty ariſing from this depoſit, to take back to myſelf the demand againſt the ſtate, and to conſider the depoſit as originally made for myſelf, and not for you.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two articles of intereſt and paper money, being thus ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, I would propoſe to divide the clear proceeds of the eſtate (in which there are from eighty to one hundred labouring ſlaves) between yourſelf and Kippen and Co. two-thirds to you, and one-third to them; and that the crop of this preſent year, 1787, ſhall conſtitute the firſt payment. That crop, you know, cannot be got to the warehouſe completely till May, of the next year; and I ſuppoſe that three months more will be little enough to ſend it to Europe, or to ſell it in Virginia, and remit the money—ſo that I could not ſafely anſwer for placing the proceeds in your hands, till the month of Auguſt; and annually every Auguſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, till the debt ſhall be paid. It will always be my intereſt, and my wiſh, to get it to you as much ſooner as poſſible, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably a part of it may always be paid ſome months ſooner. If the aſſigning the profits, in general terms, may ſeem to you too vague,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:036917_0021_100B327102695328"/>I am willing to ſix the annual payment at a certain ſum. But that I may not fall ſhort of my engagement, I ſhall name it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what leſs than I ſuppoſe may be counted on. I ſhall ſix your part at four hundred pounds ſterling annually; and as you know our crops of tobacco to be uncertain, I ſhould reſerve a right, if they fell ſhort one year, to make it up the enſuing one, without being ſuppoſed to have failed in my engagements—but every other year, at leaſt, all arrearages ſhall be fully paid up.</p>
                     <p>My part of this debt of Mr. Wayles's eſtate being one-third. I ſhould require that in proportion as I pay my third, I ſhall ſtand diſcharged as to the other two-thirds; ſo that the payment of every hundred pounds ſhall diſcharge me as to three hundred of the undivided debt.—The other gentlemen have equal means of paying, equal deſires, and more ſkill in ſuch affairs. Their parts of the debt, therefore, are at leaſt as ſure as mine, and my great object is, in caſe of any accident to myſelf, not to leave my family involved with any matters whatever.</p>
                     <p>I do not know what the balance of this debt is; the laſt account current I ſaw, was before the war, making the whole balance, principal and intereſt, ſomewhat about nine thouſand pounds; and after this, there were upwards of four hundred hogſheads of tobacco, and ſome payments in money, to be credited.—Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, this ſettlement can admit of no difficulty: and in the mean time the payments may proceed, without affecting the right of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party to have a juſt ſettlement.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, then, I propoſe, that, on your part, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh the claim to intereſt during the war; ſay from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of hoſtilities, April 19, 1775, to their ceſſation, April 19, 1783, being exactly eight years: and that in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as I pay my third, I ſhall be acquitted as to the other two-thirds. On my part, I take on myſelf the loſs of the paper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney depoſited in the treaſury. I agree to pay intereſt previous and ſubſequent to the war, and oblige myſelf to remit to you, for that and the principal four hundred pounds ſterling annually, till my third of the whole debt ſhall be fully paid; and I will begin theſe payments in Auguſt of the next year. If you think proper to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede to theſe propoſitions, be ſo good ad to ſay ſo, at the foot of a copy of this letter. On my receipt of that, I will ſend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

It will be obſerved, that the preceding letter is dated at Paris, in 1787: Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> to whom it is addreſſed, awaited Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon's return to America, and authoriſed his agent to ſettle with him there. Immediately after his arrival in Virginia, in the fall of 1789, he procured a meeting with the agent and the gentlemen intereſted, and an amicable ſettlement was made in writing, on the principles of the letter.—Mr. Jefferſon immediatdly ſold property again to the <hi>whole amount of the debt,</hi> and in the courſe of the firſt and ſecond years delivered over the obligations received for it to the agent, who took on himſelf the collection of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; ſo that now it is ſeven or eight years ſince he has paid up this debt. From the foregoing facts it appears that Mr. Jefferſon, before the preſent government exiſted, before he could have known that it was thought of, and at a time when there was no power to compel him to payment on account of Mr. Wayles's debts to Britiſh merchants, made a <hi>voluntary</hi> offer of ſettlement, on the moſt favourable terms which they have obtained under the judicial ſyſtem of the United States. The claim under the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into the treaſury of Virginia, was ſo well founded, that it received the ſanction of a circuit court there, although that deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was afterwards reverſed by the ſupreme court.—Every body who attended on the court, will recollect the impreſſive argument of Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> (now in Congreſs), in ſupport of the deciſion of the circuit court, and it will ever remain a doubt whether it ought not to have been affirmed. It is highly honourable to Mr. Jefferſon, to have waved a legal defence, which was complete at the time (as the courts of Virginia were ſovereign), ſo ſpecious in its general me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and, as it reſpected himſelf, rendered perfectly juſt, by the ſacrifice of as much property as was ſufficient to pay the debt. It is enough to ſay, that no Britiſh creditor, even where payment could not be alleged, has ever obtained more from the federal courts than Mr. Jefferſon voluntarily paid.—There was another claim made by the agent of the ſame houſe, of <hi>Farrell &amp; Jones,</hi> againſt the executors of Mr. Wayles and another, for a cargo of about <abbr>£.</abbr> 4,000 value, to be ſold on commiſſion, on account of the conſignees: Mr. Wayles aſſiſted in the ſale, but died ſoon after; and the whole collection ſurvived to the other conſignee; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, waſted it, and died a bankrupt: the agent thought he would try the chance of recovering the money from the executors of Mr. Wayles, though they had not received it: but on the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eleven of the jury determined at once againſt their liability, but the twelfth diſſenting, the caſe was laid over to the next fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral court; when a ſecond jury concurred unanimouſly with the eleven of the firſt, gave a verdict for the executors, and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the opinions of judge <hi>Iredell,</hi> who had preſided at one hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of judge <hi>Patterſon,</hi> at the other. General <hi>Marſhall,</hi> and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:036917_0023_100B32740DA2CC88"/>judge <hi>Waſhington,</hi> then of the bar, were the council for the executors. Palpably unfounded as this claim was, the trumpet of calumny, ſwelled it, when it ſuited a particular purpoſe, from one-third of <abbr>£.</abbr> 4,000 to <abbr>£.</abbr> 40,000; and from a groundleſs claim, to an unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable debt, which was to ſwallow up Mr. Jefferſon's fortune!</p>
               <p>HAVING NOW, fellow citizens, reviewed in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the whole of the combined calumnies which the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical enemies of Mr. Jefferſon have produced againſt him, and expoſed their falſehood and malice, it would be doing equal injuſtice to you, and to the honourable reputation of this diſtinguiſhed native citizen of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, not to preſent to your view, an Epitome of his public life and ſervices, and thereby poſſeſs you with a fuller knowledge of the laborious efforts and eminent uſefulneſs, by which he has ſo greatly contributed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the beſt good of our common country and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral happineſs of man: It will moreover afford the moſt effectual antidote to all the poiſonous effuſions of ſlander, and enable you to judge for yourſelves, uninfluenced by party conſiderations, whether a life hitherto ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly and ſucceſsfully devoted to the purſuit and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of ſo many great and good principles for the common benefit of mankind, ſhall by your ſuffrages to him, be rendered more eminently uſeful to America, in the all important office and character of <hi>Chief Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate</hi> and <hi>Preſident of the United States.</hi>

               <head>THOMAS JEFFERSON</head>
               <p>Was born in the year 1743, in the County of Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marle in Virginia, where he now reſides. His father was a reputable landholder of that County, and gave <hi>this,</hi> his eldeſt ſon, a college education at the univerſity of William and Mary, in the city of Williamſburg. After paſſing his degrees, being deſigned for the bar, Mr. Jefferſon commenced a ſtudent at law, under the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:036917_0024_100B327651CD5F80"/>guidance of George Wythe, now the venerable judge and ſole chancellor of Virginia.</p>
               <p>In 1766, Mr. Jefferſon came to the bar of the ſupreme court of his native ſtate, and continued to practiſe therein with great ſucceſs and reputation, until the commencement of the American revolution in 1775, and the conſequent occluſion of the courts of juſtice: during this period of active practice, the induſtrious mind of Jefferſon found time to digeſt the firſt volume of Reports of Adjudged Caſes in the Supreme Courts of Virginia, which were ever exhibited in that ſtate, and, to this day, are admitted authority in thoſe courts, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a monument of his early labours and uſeful talents.</p>
               <p>In 1774, when all America were rouſed into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the aggravated wrongs of the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Mr. Jefferſon ſtepped forward a bold and able champion of his country's rights, and publiſhed his much admired pamphlet, "A Summary View of the Rights of Britiſh America," <hi>addreſſed to the King,</hi> which brought forward againſt the author, threats of proſecution for treaſon, by lord Dunmore, then governor of Virginia; threats which produced no other effect on the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent mind of Jefferſon, than publicly to avow himſelf the author, prepared to meet all conſequences.</p>
               <p>About this time Mr. Jefferſon married the daughter of Mr. Wayles an eminent counſellor at law, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to enjoy uninterrupted domeſtic felicity in the ſociety of one of the moſt amiable of women, until the year 1780, when by her death he became the mourner of her virtues, and the guardian of their two daughters and ſurviving iſſue, to whoſe education and ſettlement in life, and the ſervice of his country, he has ever ſince faithfully devoted himſelf, ſtill remaining a widower.</p>
               <p>In the year 1775, Mr. Jefferſon was elected a member of the Virginia Convention, and on the 4th of Auguſt, in the ſame year, one of the members to repreſent the ſtate, then colony, of Virginia, in Congreſs.</p>
               <p>In that memorable year 1776, the natal year of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican emancipation from Britiſh tyranny, and of the independence and ſovereignty of the United States, Mr. Jefferſon was one of a committee of five, to wit, Thomas Jefferſon, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:036917_0025_100B32787440D8A8"/>Roger Sherman and R. R. Livingſton; appointed by Congreſs to draught the Declaration of Independence, and it was from the pen and enlightened mind of Jefferſon, firſt named of the committee, that that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inſtrument proceeded, which was reported by the committee, and unanimouſly adopted by Congreſs, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <hi>"The Declaration of Independence, &amp;c."</hi> An inſtrument which, ſo long as the records of time ſhall endure, will perpetuate the fame of its author, and preſerve, in the American mind, <hi>forever</hi> and <hi>inſeparable,</hi> the names of <hi>Independence</hi> and <hi>Jefferſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſame year, 1776, the ardent mind of Jefferſon, eagerly purſuing the glorious principles of the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and foreſeeing that ſo long as the corruptions of Britiſh ſyſtems exiſted, we were independent in name not in fact, produced for the adoption of the legiſlature of his native ſtate, the four following important acts, to wit;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1ſt. An act for eſtabliſhing religious freedom, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in this eſſay.</item>
                  <item>2. An act to regulate deſcents, to prevent eſtates en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail and the rights of primogeniture.</item>
                  <item>3. An act for the apportionment of crimes and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.</item>
                  <item>4th. An act to eſtabliſh public ſchools.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The influence of theſe acts upon the relative princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples they embrace will be univerſally ſeen and felt by thoſe who prize civil liberty as a primary bleſſing, and regard the preſervation of it as among the firſt beheſts of God to man—whilſt ſyſtems of univerſal toleration in matters of religion; for an equal diſtribution of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and in ſubverſion of the ariſtocratic and unnatural principle of entail and primogeniture right; for ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorating the ſanguinary code of criminal law; and for extending to the pooreſt claſs of our citizens, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of education at public expenſe, will be viewed as the emanations of a great and good mind, zealouſly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to promote the happineſs and improve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his fellow beings.</p>
               <p>Equally evincive of watchful regard to the rights of his countrymen, was the ſcheme and ſuggeſtion made by Mr. Jefferſon for the formation and adoption of the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Virginia, in the ſame year, for prefixing thereto
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:036917_0026_100B327ADB5A3280"/>A Bill of Rights, declaratory of the natural and unalien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rights of man," which was accordingly done.</p>
               <p>In the year 1778, Mr. Jefferſon being then a member of the Virginia Legiſlature, preſented to that body the act "to prevent the importation of ſlaves," which was enacted into a law in the month of October in the ſame year, and was ſhortly after followed by another act "to authoriſe manumiſſions," being the commencement of a ſyſtem of gradual emancipation, alſo propoſed by him.</p>
               <p>In the year 1779, Mr. Jefferſon, at the age of 36, was choſen governor of Virginia, and continued in that office until June 1781—during which the ſtate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced three invaſions, and was alſo brought into a critical ſtate of colliſion reſpecting its boundary lines with two neighbouring ſtates, North-Carolina and Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania. His conduct in that ſtation amidſt the jarring conflicts and trying difficulties of foreign invaſion and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic diſquietude, was ſuch, as ſecured to him, 6 months after he left the office, and upon the fulleſt public enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the <hi>unanimous</hi> vote of thanks of the Legiſlature, conſiſting of 180 members, "for his attentive adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the powers of the executive whilſt in office."</p>
               <p>It was during the ſame year, 1781, amidſt the cares of government and ſcenes of private affliction, that Mr. Jefferſon prepared his celebrated work, afterwards pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in France, and which he modeſtly ſtiled <hi>"Notes on Virginia."</hi> In this work, ſo juſtly admired by all the learned world, for its philoſophical reſearch, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious theory, and able diſquiſition, equally evidenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an enlarged, liberal and pious mind, the author, in a ſuperior ſtyle of eloquence, boldly attacks and fully refutes the fallacious theories of Mr. Buffon and the Abbe Kaynal, which tend to diſparage the animal and its ſpecies, both man and beaſt, of the American world, and reduce them to a ſcale ſmaller than thoſe of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; vindicating with truth and intelligence the equal diſtribution of nature's bleſſings to America.</p>
               <p>In the year 1783, Mr. Jefferſon was again appointed to a ſeat in Congreſs from his native ſtate, and in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing year, on the 7th of May, was nominated by that honourable body miniſter plenipotentiary of the United States to the Court of France, as the ſucceſſor of our illuſtrious Franklin, whither he embarked early in the

               <p>During his miſſion to France, Mr. Jefferſon with that peculiar addreſs, intelligence and attention to promote the eſſential intereſts of the United States, which directs all his conduct, obtained from the French king, an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rette, highly beneficial to the American commerce, for the free admiſſion, exempt from the cuſtomary foreign duties, of oil, fiſh and whalebone, the product of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican fiſheries, into certain ports, and for the ſale of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican built ſhips in all the ports of France—benefits, which our Eaſtern brethren continued to reap the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar advantage of, until the commencement of the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionary convulſions which have agitated that nation.</p>
               <p>About the ſame period alſo, Mr. Jefferſon, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with our immortal Franklin, negociated with a miniſter from the court of Pruſſia, then at the Hague, that celebrated treaty known by the name of <hi>"The Pruſſian treaty,"</hi> in which an aſtoniſhed world has, for the firſt time, ſeen a public avowal and poſitive proviſion by treaty, between two ſovereign and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent nations, for the eſtabliſhment of thoſe two great and glorious principles, promotive of univerſal peace and happineſs, to wit, 1ſt. <hi>"That free ſhips ſhall make free goods:"</hi> and 2d. <hi>"That privateering in time of war be aboliſhed;"</hi> principles which it were to be wiſhed could be rendered univerſal and eternal. Mr. Adams, now preſident of the United States, was one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for negociating this treaty, and on its comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was ſent over to London, where Mr. Adams then reſided as miniſter of the United States, for his ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is greatly to be regretted that Mr. Adams could not be content to retain to himſelf a ſhare of the glory which reflects on the authors of this celebrated treaty. But, unhappily for our country, ſince he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came preſident of the United States, we have ſeen
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:036917_0028_100B327E8AA66508"/>him nominate his ſon John Quincy Adams, as miniſter to the court of Pruſſia, for the expreſs purpoſe, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, of renewing the treaty with that nation, which having been limited to continue in force for ten years only, had expired. Accordingly another treaty has been made by his ſon with Pruſſia, which has been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by a majority of the Senate and ratified by the preſident, but which, inſtead of renewing and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the old treaty, is in itſelf a new one, expreſsly abandoning and renouncing the two ineſtimable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, 1ſt. <hi>"That free ſhips make free goods;"</hi> and 2d. <hi>"That privateering in time of war be aboliſhed;"</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which, it appears, from the correſpondence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the negociation, laid before the ſenate of the United States by the preſident, the wiſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened miniſters of the Pruſſian monarch, were brought, with great difficulty and reluctance, to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, on the earneſt ſolicitation and reiterated demand of the American negociator, under the ſuggeſtion that the maritime powers, <hi>particularly Great-Britain,</hi> would never ſanction or permit them.</p>
               <p>In the year 1789, Mr. Jefferſon being returned to the United States, and appointed by preſident Waſhington, ſecretary to the department of ſtate, immediately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on the arduous duties of that important ſtation, having previouſly ſtipulated with the preſident, that in conſideration of the many years abſence from his family and eſtate, he might be permitted, at the expiration of the conſtitutional term for which the preſident was elected, to retire from the public ſervice.</p>
               <p>The firſt reſult of the labours of Mr. Jefferſon in the department of ſtate, were exhibited to Congreſs in the following reports, to wit;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1ſt. A report, on the the fiſheries of the United States.</item>
                  <item>2d. A report, on coins, weights and meaſures.</item>
                  <item>3d. A report, on the waſte and unappropriated lands of the United States.</item>
                  <item>4th. A report, on the privileges and reſtrictions on the commerce of the United States in foreign countries.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Each of theſe reports diſplayed the uſual accuracy, information, and intelligence of the writer.</p>
               <p>But it was reſerved for a more critical and delicate
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:036917_0029_100B32819CA8F1D0"/>period in the affairs of the United States, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent talents of the American ſecretary ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come moſt conſpicuous, and intereſtingly uſeful to his country: The non-execution of the treaty of peace with the United States, on the part of Great-Britain, her detention of our Weſtern poſts, and the attendant ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations on our commerce, both by Great-Britain and France, then at war with each other, added to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of the miniſter of the latter, Genet, all conduced to a ſituation difficult and perplexing. Beſides which, Spain continued to withhold from us the free navigation of the Miſſiſippi, ſo eſſential to all Weſtern America. In this ſtate of things, the juſt confidence, which, the diſcriminating mind of Waſhington, had repoſed in Mr. Jefferſon, was amply repaid, by that promptneſs, zeal and ability, with which the American ſecretary, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted by his labours, to relieve the executive from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment. Through a ſeries of maſterly and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled diplomatique correſpondence, which he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, at the ſame time, with the reſpective miniſters of Great-Britain and France, namely Hammond and Genet, he traverſed and rebutted their reſpective cauſes of charge and complaint againſt the United States, and having fully proved the various aggreſſions and infrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of treaty on the part of their reſpective govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, pointed to the means for preſerving the honour and maintaining the rights of his own country, whilſt alike ſuperior to the intrigues of Great-Britain or of France, he fully manifeſted that he held no particular attachment to any foreign nation, but was equally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, with the deciſion, firmneſs and intelligence of a true American, to oppoſe and reſiſt the aggreſſions of all. The recal of Genet, and appointment of his ſucceſſor, with the ſubſequent proceedings between the United States and France, the appointment of Mr. Jay, his treaty with Great-Britain and the recal of Mr. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, appointment of Mr. Liſton, and ſubſequent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings with Great-Britain, are all well known. In reſpect to Spain, the labours of Mr. Jefferſon, were more immediately effective and complete. Having poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the commiſſioners of the United States then at Madrid, negociating a treaty with the court of Spain,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:036917_0030_100B32839EDB8D28"/>with the moſt ample and pointed inſtructions, and alſo of the form and proviſions of a treaty, predicated on the baſis of the free navigation of the Miſſiſippi, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained only for Mr. Thomas Pinckney, then miniſter from the United States at London, under ſpecial inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the preſident, and appointed envoy for that purpoſe, to repair to Madrid, and ſeizing the favourable moment for effecting it, to accompliſh this deſirable work. This was accordingly done, with equal prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deciſion on his part, and jointly to that, and the labours of the American ſecretary in the cabinet, are the United States indebted for the moſt liberal, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and beneficial treaty, they have ever yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into with a foreign nation.—Here the review of the public life and labours of Mr. Jefferſon ceaſes.</p>
               <p>About this time, having, at the preſſing entreaty of the then preſident, Waſhington, remained one year longer at the head of the department of ſtate, than he had before ſtipulated to do, he reſigned his office, and retired with the warmeſt thanks and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret of the preſident, Waſhington, to his eſtate at Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticello, in Albemarle County, Virginia, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for upwards of two years uninterruptedly to enjoy the ſweets of domeſtic eaſe, and a reſpite from the fatigues of public life, following with avidity his favourite purſuits of philoſophical reſearch and agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultural improvement, until the voice of his country again ſummoned him to the more active ſcenes of public duty, and placed him in nomination for the preſidential chair, as the ſucceſſor of Waſhington. The iſſue of that election is well known, and but for a falſe return in one ſtate, and the ſuppreſſion of a return in another, Mr. Jefferſon would have been declared preſident, as the returns however ſtood before Congreſs, it appeared that he had 68 votes, and Mr. Adams 71, conſequently the latter was declared preſident, and the former vice-preſident of the United States.</p>
               <p>In the month of January, 1797, Mr. Jefferſon was elected preſident of the American Philoſophical Society, held at Philadelphia, as ſucceſſor of the great and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Rittenhouſe, who was the immediate ſucceſſor of our immortal Franklin, the founder of that ſociety.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:036917_0031_100B328534DFFED8"/>
And now, <hi>for the ſecond time,</hi> the voice of his country has placed Mr. Jefferſon in nomination for the <hi>preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential chair.</hi>

               <p>In the foregoing addreſs you are preſented with two very oppoſite characters of Mr. Jefferſon:</p>
               <p>The firſt, written by the pen of his enemies, conceived in malignity and malevolence, under the powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of party feeling and political reſentment, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits him to you as the worſt of men, an enemy to his God, an enemy to his country, an enemy to the human race. It derives a momentary ſupport from the baſeſt fabrications and wickedeſt falſehoods. It cannot long deceive, ſince it fully betrays the jealouſy, fear and anger of its authors; jealouſy, of his unrivalled talents; fear, that on his elevation to the preſidency, every germ of monarchy and ariſtocracy in our country will diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate at the electrical touch of his republican virtues; and anger, that notwithſtanding all their detractious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, he continues to poſſeſs the unſhaken and undimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed confidence of the great body of the American people.</p>
               <p>The latter character of Mr. Jefferſon, is drawn not by the partial hand of a friend, nor under the influence of political or party prejudices: there is no need of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brication, falſehood or deception. You ſee it in the faithful and unerring record of his many great and virtuous deeds; in the public uſefulneſs and eminent ſervices of a well ſpent life; in the numerous teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials of his country's approbation, and, by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſuffrage of the foreign world, in their acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged tributes of reſpect and eſteem for the talents of his head and the virtues of his heart. Its leading fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures preſent to you a man of pure, ardent and unaffected piety; of ſincere and genuine virtue; of an enlightened mind and ſuperior wiſdom; the adorer of our God; the patriot of his country; and the friend and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor of the whole human race.</p>
               <p>And ſuch fellow citizens, is the TRUE and REAL cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of THOMAS JEFFERSON, unaided by artificial co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourings or the falſe varniſh of deceptive flattery.</p>
