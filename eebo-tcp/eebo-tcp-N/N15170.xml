            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE late Lord Cheſterfield having been uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally allowed, to be one of the beſt bred men of the age, and moſt intimately acquainted with the principles and manners of mankind, the Editor of the following pages humbly apprebends, he could not do the riſing generation a greater ſervice, than by collecting thoſe valuable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts that are contained in his celebrated letters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:019258_0004_0FAA6A168C56BCB8"/>ſeries of chapters, point out, under diſtinct heads, the qualifications neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to make him well received in the world, without which he cannot expect to bear his part in life, agreeable to his own wiſhes, or the duty he owes to ſociety; and as modeſty is the baſis of a proper reception, I ſhall begin with that.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>MODESTY.</head>
               <p>MODESTY is a polite accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, and generally an attendant upon merit: It is engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the higheſt degree, and wins the heart of all our acquaintance. On the contrary none are more diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in company than the impudent and preſuming.</p>
               <p>The man who is, on all occaſions, commending and ſpeaking well of himſelf, we naturally diſlike. On the other hand, he who ſtudies to conceal his own deſerts, who does juſtice to the merit of others, who talks but
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:019258_0004_0FAA6A168C56BCB8"/>little of himſelf, and that with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, makes a favourable impreſſion on the perſons he is converſing with, captivates their minds, and gains their eſteem.</p>
               <p>Modeſty, however, widely differs from an aukward baſhfulneſs, which is as much to be condemned as the other is to be applauded. To appear ſimple is as ill-bred as to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. A young man ought to be able to come into a room and adreſs the company without the leaſt embaraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To be out of countenance when ſpoken to, and not to have an anſwer ready is ridiculous to the laſt degree.</p>
               <p>An aukward country fellow, when he comes into company better than himſelf, is exceedingly diſconcerted. He knows not what to do with his hands, or his hat, but either puts one of them in his pocket, and dangles the other by his ſide; or perhaps twirls his hat on his fingers, or fumbles with
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:019258_0005_0FAA6A17677F09C8"/>the button. If ſpoken to, he is in a much worſe ſituation, he anſwers with the utmoſt difficulty and nearly ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers: whereas a gentleman who is acquainted with life, enters a room with gracefulneſs and a modeſt aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, addreſſes even perſons he does not know, in an eaſy and natural manner, and without the leaſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment. This is the characteriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic of good breeding, a very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry knowledge in our intercourſe with men; for one of inferior parts, with the behaviour of a gentleman, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently better received than a man of ſenſe with the addreſs and manners of a clown.</p>
               <p>Ignorance and vice are the only things we need be aſhamed of; ſteer clear of theſe, and you may go into any company you will; not that I would have a young man throw of all dread of appearing abroad, as a fear of offending, or being diſeſteemed, will make him preſerve a proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:019258_0005_0FAA6A17677F09C8"/>Some perſons, from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periencing the inconveniencies of falſe modeſty, have run into the other extreme, and acquired the character of impudent. This is as great a fault as the other. A well-bred man keeps himſelf within the two, and ſteers the middle way. He is eaſy and firm in every company, is modeſt, but not baſhful, ſteady but not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent. He copies the manners of the better people, and conforms to their cuſtoms with eaſe and attention.</p>
               <p>Till we can preſent ourſelves in all companies with coolneſs and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, we can never preſent ourſelves well; nor will a man ever be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have kept good company, or ever be acceptable in ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, if he cannot appear there eaſy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Inſtead of becoming inſolent, a
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:019258_0006_0FAA6A18B035ACC0"/>man of ſenſe under a conſciouſneſs of merit, is more modeſt. He behave himſelf with firmneſs, but without the leaſt preſumption. The man who is ignorant of his own merit is no leſs a fool than he who is conſtantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing it. A man of underſtanding avails himſelf of his abilities, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver boaſts of them; whereas the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid and baſhful can never puſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in life, but will be always kept behind by the forward and buſtling.

               <p>Lies generally proceed from vanity, cowardice, and a revengeful diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſometimes from a miſtaken notion of ſelf-defence.</p>
               <p>He who tells a malicious lie, with a view of injuring the perſon he ſpeaks of, may gratify his wiſh for a while, but will, in the end, find it recoil upon himſelf; for, as ſoon as he is detected, (and detected he moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly will be) he is deſpiſed for the infamous attempt, and whatever he may ſay hereafter of that perſon, will be conſidered as falſe, whether it be ſo or not.</p>
               <p>If a man lies, ſhuffles or equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, for, in fact, they are all alike, by way of excuſe for any thing he has ſaid or done, he aggravates the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence rather than leſſens it; for the perſon to whom the lie is told has a right to know the truth, or there

               <head>GOOD-BREEDING.</head>
               <p>VOID of good breeding, every other qualification will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect unadorned, and to a certain degree unavailing.</p>
               <p>Good breeding being the reſult of good ſenſe and good nature, is it not wonderful that people poſſeſſed of the one ſhould be deficient in the other? The modes of it varving according to perſons, places, and circumſtances, cannot indeed be acquired otherwiſe than by time and obſervation, but the ſubſtance is every where and always the ſame.</p>
               <p>What good morals are to ſociety in general, good manners are to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:019258_0010_0FAA6A1BAD9A7428"/>ones; their band and ſecurity. Of all actions, next to that of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming a good one, the conſciouſneſs of rendering a civility is the moſt grateful.</p>
               <p>We ſeldom ſee a perſon, let him be ever ſo ill-bred, wanting in reſpect to thoſe whom he acknowledges to be his ſuperiors; the manner of ſhewing this reſpect then is all I contend for. The well-bred man expreſſes it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and eaſily, while he who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed to good company expreſſes it awkwardly. Study, then, to ſhew that reſpect which every one wiſhes to ſhew in an eaſy and grateful way; but this muſt be learnt by obſervation.</p>
               <p>In company with your equals or in mixed companies, a greater lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude may be take in your behaviour; yet, it ſhould never exceed the bounds of decency; for though no one in this caſe can claim any diſtinguiſhed marks of reſpect, every one is entitled to civility and good manners. A man
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:019258_0011_0FAA6A1C6A551110"/>need not, for example, fear to put his hands in his pockets, take ſnuff, ſit, ſtand, or occaſionally walk about the room; but it would be highly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming to whiſtle wear his hat, looſen his garters, or throw himſelf acroſs the chairs. Such liberties are offenſive to our equals, and inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our inferiors. Eaſineſs of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage by no means implies inattention and careleſſneſs. No one is at liberty to act in all reſpects, as he pleaſes; but is bound by the laws of good manners to behave with decorum.</p>
               <p>Let a man talk to you ever ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly or frivolouſly, not to pay ſome attention to what he ſays, is ſavage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to the greateſt degree. Nay if he even forces his converſation to you, it is worſe than rudneſs not to liſten to him; for your inattention in this caſe, tells him, in expreſs terms, that you think him a blockhead and not worth the hearing. Now, if ſuch behaviour is rude to men, it is much more ſo to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:019258_0011_0FAA6A1C6A551110"/>women, who, be their rank what it will, have on account of their ſex, a claim to officious attention from the men. Their little wants and whims, their likes and diſlikes, and even their impertinences, are particularly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to and flattered, and their very thoughts and wiſhes gueſſed at and inſtantly gratified by every well-bred man.</p>
               <p>In promiſcuous companies, you ſhould vary your addreſs, aggreeable to the different ages of the perſons you ſpeak to. It would be rude and abſurd to talk of your amours or your pleaſures to men of certain dignity and gravity to clergy men, or men in years; but ſtill you ſhould be as eaſy with them as with others, your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner only ſhould be varied; you ſhould, if poſſible double your reſpect and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to them; and were you to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate occaſionally, that from their obſervation and experience you wiſh to profit, you would inſenſibly win
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:019258_0012_0FAA6A1D2B367060"/>their eſteem; for flattery if not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and groſs, is aggreeable to all.</p>
               <p>When invited to dinner or ſupper, you muſt never uſurp to yourſelf the beſt places, the beſt diſhes, &amp;c. but allways decline them, and offer them to others, except, indeed, you are offered any thing by a ſuperior when it would be a rudeneſs, if you liked it, not to accept it immediately, without the leaſt apology. Thus, for example, was a ſuperior, the maſter of the table, to offer you a thing of which there was but one, to paſs it to the perſon next you, would be indirectly charging him that offered it to you, with a want of good manners and proper reſpect to his company; or, if you were the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtranger preſent, it would be a rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs if you would make a feint of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing it with the cuſtomary apology, <q>I cannot think of taking it from you, ſir;</q> or, <q>I am ſorry to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive you of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is rudeneſs to draw back when requeſted by a ſuperior to paſs a door firſt, or to ſtep into a carriage before him. In ſhort, it would be endleſs to particulariſe all the inſtances in which a well bred man ſhews his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs in good company, ſuch as not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But, good-breeding conſiſts in more than merely not being ill-bred. To return a bow, ſpeak when you are ſpoken to, and ſay nothing rude, are ſuch negative acts of good-breeding, that they are little more than not being a brute, would it not be a very poor commendation of any man's cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:019258_0013_0FAA6A1E068599F8"/>to ſay that he was not offenſive? If we wiſh for the good will and eſteem of our acquaintance, our good-breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, muſt be active, chearful, offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſeducing.</p>
               <p>For example, ſhould you invite any one to dine or ſup with you, recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect whether ever you had obſerved them to prefer one thing to another and endeavour to procure that thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>This is the wine I obſerved you beſt like, I have therefore been at ſome pains to procure it.</q> Trifl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as theſe things may appear, they prove an attention to the perſon they are ſaid to; and as attention in trifle is the teſt of reſpect, the compliment will not be loſt.</p>
               <p>I need only refer you to your ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The declaration of the women in a great degree ſtamp a man's reputation of being either ill or well-bred; you muſt then in a manner, overwhelm them with theſe attentions, they are uſed to them, and naturally expect them, and to do them juſtice, they are ſeldom loſt upon them. You muſt be ſedulous to wait upon them, pick up with alacrity any thing they drop, and be very officious in procuring their carriages or their chairs in public places; be blind to what you ſhould not ſee, and deaf to what you ſhould not hear. Opportunities of ſhewing theſe attentions are continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting themſelves; but in caſe they ſhould not you muſt ſtudy to create them.</p>
               <p>If ever you would be eſteemed by the women, your converſation to them ſhould be always reſpectful, lively, and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:019258_0014_0FAA6A1EA7EB48B8"/>addreſſed to their vanity. Every thing you ſay or do, ſhould tend to ſhew a regard to their beauty or good ſenſe; even men are not without their vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of one kind or other, and flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that vanity by words and looks of approbation, is one of the principal characters of good-breeding.</p>
               <p>Addreſs and manners, with weak perſons, who are actually three-fourths of the world, are every thing; and even people of the beſt underſtanding are taken in with them. Where the heart is not won and the eye pleaſed, the mind will ſeldom be on our ſide.</p>
               <p>In ſhort learning and erudition, without good breeding, is tireſome and pedantic; and an ill-bred man is a unfit for good company as he will be unwelcome in it. Nay, he is full as unfit for buſineſs as for company. M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="28" facs="unknown:019258_0015_0FAA6A1F66648978"/>comes into a room, he attempts to bow, and his ſword, if he wears one, goes between his legs, and nearly throws him down. Confuſed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, he ſtumbles to the upper end of the room, and ſeats himſelf in the very chair he ſhould not. He there begins playing with his hat, which he preſently drops; and recovering his hat, he lets fall his cane; and in pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his cane, down goes his hat again; thus 'tis a conſiderable time before he is a duſted. When his tea or coffee is handed to him, he ſpreads his handkerchief upon his knees, ſcalds his mouth, drops either the cup or the ſacuer, and ſpills the tea or coffee in his lap. At dinner he is more uncommonly awkward; there he tucks his napkin through a button<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole which tickles his chin, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions him to make a variety of wry faces; he ſeats himſelf upon the edge of the chair, at ſo great a diſtance from the table, that he frequently drops his
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:019258_0015_0FAA6A1F66648978"/>meat between his plate and his mouth; he holds his knife, fork and ſpoon dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently from other people; eats with his knife, to the manifeſt danger of his mouth; picks his teeth with his fork, rakes his mouth with his finger, and puts his ſpoon which has been in his throat a dozen times, into the diſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. If he is to carve, he cannot hit the joint, but in labouring to cut through the bone, ſplaſhes the ſauce over every body's cloths. He gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally daubs himſelf all over, his elbows are in the next perſon's plate, and he is up to the knuckles in ſoup and greaſe. If he drinks, it is with his mouth full, interrupting the whole company wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> "To your good health, ſir," and "My ſervice to you," perhaps coughs in his glaſs, and he ſprinkles the whole table. Further, he has perhaps a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of diſagreeable tricks, he ſnuffs up his noſe, picks it with his fingers, blows it and look in his handkerchief, crams his hands firſt into his boſom,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:019258_0016_0FAA6A2062B1BAA8"/>and next into his breeches. In ſhort, he neither dreſſes nor acts like any other perſon, but is particularly awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in every thing he does. All this, I own, has nothing in it criminal; but it is ſuch an offence to good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and good-breeding, that it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally deſpiſed; it makes a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ridiculous in every company, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> courſe, ought carefully to be avoided by every one who would wiſh to pleaſe.</p>
               <p>From this picture of the ill-bred man, you will eaſily diſtinguiſh that of the well-bred; for you may readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge what you ought to do, when you are told what you ought not to do; a little attention to the manners of thoſe who have ſeen the world, will make a proper behaviour habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and familiar to you.</p>
               <p>Actions that would otherwiſe be pleaſing, frequently become ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous by your manner of doing them. If a lady drops her fan in company, the worſt-bred man would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:019258_0016_0FAA6A2062B1BAA8"/>pick it up, and give it to her; the beſt bred-man can do no more; but then he does it in a graceful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that is ſure to pleaſe, whereas the other would do it ſo awkwardly as to be laughed at.</p>
               <p>You may alſo know a well-bred perſon by his manner of ſitting. Aſhamed and confuſed, the awkward man ſits in his chair ſtiff and bolt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, whereas the man of faſhion, is eaſy in every poſition; inſtead of lol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or lounging as he ſits, he leans with elegance, and by varying his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, ſhews that he has been uſed to good company. Let it be one part of your ſtudy then, to learn to ſit gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teely in different companies, to loll gracefully, where you are authorized to take that liberty, and to ſit up reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectfully, where that freedom is not allowable.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, you cannot conceive how advantageous a graceful carriage and a pleaſing addreſs are, upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:019258_0017_0FAA6A20E516E368"/>they enſnare the affections, ſteal a prepoſſeſſion in our favour, and, play about the heart till they engage it.</p>
               <p>Now to acquire a graceful air you muſt attend to your dancing; no one can either ſit, ſtand or wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Our voice and manner of ſpeaking too, ſhould likewiſe be attended to. Some will mumble over their words, ſo as not to be intelligible, and others will ſpeak ſo faſt as not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and, in doing this, will ſputter and ſpit in your face; ſome will bawl as if they were ſpeaking to the deaf; others will ſpeak ſo low as ſcarcely to be heard; and many will put their face ſo cloſe to yours as to offend you with their breath. All theſe habits are horrid and diſguſtful, put may eaſily be got the better of, with care.

Be aſſured then, the air, the geſture, the looks of a ſpeaker a proper accent, a juſt emphaſis and tuneful cadence are full as neceſſary to pleaſe and be attended to, as the ſubject matter itſelf.</p>

<pb n="42" facs="unknown:019258_0022_0FAA6A258883A060"/>do not obſerve the proper ſtops, lay a wrong emphaſis or utter your words indiſtinctly. You may even read aloud to yourſelf where ſuch a friend is not at hand, and you will find your own ear a good corrector. Take care to open your teeth when you read or ſpeak, and articulate every word diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly; which laſt cannot be done, but by ſounding the final letter. But above all, endeavour to vary your voice according to the matter, and avoid a monotony. By a daily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to this, it will, in a little time, become eaſy and habitual to you.</p>
               <p>Pay an attention alſo to your looks and your geſture, when talking even on the moſt trifling ſubjects; things appear very different according as they are expreſſed, looked and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>Now, if it is neceſſary to attend ſo particularly to our <hi>manner</hi> of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is much more ſo, with reſpect to the <hi>matter.</hi> Fine turns of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

A gentleman, its true, may be known in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt garb, but it admits not of a doubt, that he would be better received into good company, genteely and faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably dreſſed, than was he to appear in dirt and tatters.</p>
               <p>Be careful then of your ſtyle upon all occaſions; whether you write or ſpeak, ſtudy for the beſt words and beſt expreſſions, even in common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation or the moſt familiar letters. This will prevent your ſpeaking in a hurry, than which nothing is more vulgar; though you may be a little embarraſſed at firſt, time and uſe will render it eaſy. It is no ſuch difficult thing to expreſs ourſelves well on ſubjects we are thoroughly acquainted with, if we think before we ſpeak; and no one ſhould preſume to do

               <p>There have been people who have frequented the firſt companies all their lifetime, and yet have never got rid of their natural ſtiffeneſs and awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs; but have continued as vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar as if they were never out of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants hall; this has been owing to careleſſneſs, and a want of attention to the manners and behaviour of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>There are a great many people likewiſe who buſy themſelves the whole day, and who in fact do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. They have poſſibly taken up a book for two or three hours, but from a certain inattention that gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this manner they wear away their hours, that might otherwiſe be employed to their improvement and advantage. This ſilly ſuſpenſion of thought they would paſs for <hi>abſence of mind</hi>—ridiculous! Wherever you are, let me recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to you to pay an attention to all that paſſes; obſerve the characters of the perſons you are with, and the ſubjects of their converſation; liſten to every thing that is ſaid, ſee every thing that is done, and according to the vulgar ſaying have your eyes and your ears about you.</p>

                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:019258_0027_0FAA698366E47F48"/>
A continual inattention to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that occur is the characteriſtic of a weak mind the man who gives way to it, is little elſe than a trifler, a blank in ſociety, which every ſenſible perſon overlooks; ſurely what is worth doing is worth doing well, and nothing can be well done, if not properly attended to. When I hear a man ſay on being aſked about any thing that was ſaid or done in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, "that truly he did not mind it." I am ready to knock the fool down. <hi>Why</hi> did not he mind it?— What elſe had he to do?—A man of ſenſe and faſhion never makes uſe of this paltry plea, he never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of a treacherous memory, but attends to and remembers every thing that is either ſaid or done.</p>
               <p>Whenever then, you go into good company, that is the company of people of faſhion, obſerve carefully their behaviour, their addreſs and their manner; imitate it as far as in your
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:019258_0027_0FAA698366E47F48"/>power. Your attention if poſſible, ſhould be ſo ready as to obſerve every perſon in the room at once, their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their looks, and their turns of expreſſion, and that without ſtaring or ſeeming to be an obſerver. This kind of obſervation may be acquired by care and practice, and will be found of the utmoſt advantage to you, in the courſe of life.</p>

               <p>However inſignificant a company may be; however trifling their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; while you are with them, do not ſhew them by an inattention that you think them trifling; that can never be the way to pleaſe, but rather fall in with their weakneſs than otherwiſe, for to mortify, or ſhew the leaſt contempt to thoſe we are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with, is the greateſt rudeneſs we can be guilty of, and what few can forgive.</p>
               <p>I never yet found a man inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the perſon he feared, or the woman he loved; which convinces me, that abſence of mind is to be got the better of, if we think proper to

                  </gap>oolneſs.</p>
               <p>Many people have ſenſe enough to keep their own ſecrets; but from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unuſed to a variety of company, have unfortunately ſuch a tell-tale countenance, as involuntary declares what they would wiſh to conceal.

That coolneſs of mind and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of countenance, which prevents a diſcovery of our ſentiments, by our words, our actions, or our looks, is too neceſſary to paſs unnoticed. A man who can not hear diſpleaſing things, without viſible marks of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or uneaſineſs; or pleaſing one's, without a ſudden burſt of joy, a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eye, or an expanded face, is at the mercy of every knave, for either they will deſignedly pleaſe or provoke you themſelves to catch your unguarded looks, or they will ſeize the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity thus to read your very heart, when any other ſhall do it. You may poſſibly tell me, that this cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt be natural, for if not, you can never acquire it. I will admit the force of conſtitution, but people are very apt to blame that for many things they might readily avoid. Care with a little reflection, will ſoon give you this maſtery of your temper and your countenance. If you find
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:019258_0033_0FAA698A96FA8D98"/>yourſelf ſubject to ſudden ſtarts of paſſion determine with yourſelf not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As a man who at a card table can preſerve a ſerenity in his looks, under good or bad luck, has conſiderably the advantage of one who appears elated with ſucceſs, or caſt down with ill fortune, from our being able to read his cards in his face, ſo the man of the world, having to deal with one of thoſe bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>In the courſe of life, we ſhall find, it neceſſary very often to put on a pleaſing countenance, when we are exceedingly diſpleaſed; we muſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeem friendly when we are quite otherwiſe. I am ſenſible it is difficult to accoſt a man with ſmiles
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:019258_0034_0FAA698AEE030D80"/>whom we know to be our enemy: but what is to be done? On receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an affront if you cannot be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in knocking the offender down, you muſt not notice the offence; for, in the eye of the world taking an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front calmly is conſidered as cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>
               <p>If fools ſhould attempt at any time to be witty upon you, the beſt way is not to know their witticiſms are level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at you, but to conceal any uneaſineſs it may give you: but ſhould they be ſo plain that you cannot be thought ignorant of their meaning, I would recomend, rather than quarrel with the company, joining even in the laugh againſt yourſelf; allow the jeſt to be a good one, and take it in ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good humour. Never attempt to retaliate the ſame way, as that would imply you were hurt. Should what is ſaid wound your honour or your moral character there is but one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reply, which I hope you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be obliged to have recourſe to.</p>

Remember there are but two alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natives for a gentleman; extreme politeneſs, or the ſword. If a man openly and deſignedly affronts you, call him out; but, if it does not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to an open inſult, be outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly civil; if this does not make him aſhamed of his behaviour, it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice every by-ſtander in your favour, and inſtead of being diſgraced, you will come off with honour. Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to thoſe we do not reſpect, is no more a breach of faith, than <hi>your humble ſervant</hi> at the bottom of a challenge; they are univerſally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be things of courſe.</p>

               <p>There is ſtill among young people mother kind of friendſhip merely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal; warm indeed for a time, but fortunately of no long continuance. This friendſhip takes its riſe from their purſuing the ſame courſe of riot and debauchery; their purſes are open to each other, they tell one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other all they know, they embark in the ſame quarrels, and ſtand by each
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:019258_0039_0FAA698EB1437EF8"/>other on all occaſions. I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther call this a confederacy againſt good morals and good manners, and think it deſerves the ſevereſt laſh of the law: but they have the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to call it friendſhip. However, it is often as ſuddenly diſolved as it is haſtily contracted; ſome accident diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſes them and they preſently forget each other, except it is to betray and to laugh at their own egregious folly.</p>

In this faſhionable good company alone, can you learn the beſt manners and the beſt language: for, as there is no legal ſtandard to form them by, 'tis here they are eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>It may poſſibly be queſtioned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man has it always in his power to get into good company, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, by deſerving it, he has, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he is in circumſtances which enable him to live and appear in the ſtile of a gentleman. Knowledge, modeſty and good-breeding, will endear him to all that ſee him; for without po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs, the ſcholar is no better than a pedant, the philoſopher than a cynic, the ſoldier than a brute, nor any man than a clown.</p>
               <p>Though the company of men of learning and genius is highly to be valued and occaſionally coveted, I would by no means have you always found in ſuch company. As they do not live in the world, they cannot have that eaſy manner and addreſs which
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:019258_0040_0FAA698F8AF62700"/>I would wiſh you to acquire. If you can bear a part in ſuch company it is certainly adviſeable to be in it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and you will be the more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed in other company by being ſo; but let it not engroſs you, leſt it ſhould be conſidered as one of the <hi>literati,</hi> which however reſpectable in name, is not the way to riſe or ſhine in the faſhionable world.</p>
               <p>But the company which, of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, you ſhould carefully avoid, is that, which in every ſenſe of the words may be called <hi>low:</hi> low in birth, low in rank, low in parts, and low in manners; that company, who, inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant and contemptible in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, think it an honour to be ſeen with <hi>you,</hi> and who will flatter your follies, nay your very vices, to keep you with them.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>you</hi> may think ſuch a caution unneceſſary, I do not; for many a young gentleman of ſenſe and rank, has been led by his vanity

               <p>The vanity I mean is that of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt of the company. This pride, tho' too common, is idle to the laſt degree. Nothing in the world lets a man down ſo much. For the ſake of dictating, being applauded and admired by this low company, he is diſgraced and diſqualified for better. Depend upon it, in the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of mankind, you will ſink or riſe to the level of the company you keep.</p>

If you are invited to drink, at any man's houſe, more than you think is wholeſome, you may ſay, <q>you wiſh you could, but that ſo little makes you both drunk and ſick; that you ſhould only be bad company by doing it: of courſe beg to be excuſed.</q> If de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to play at cards deeper than you would, refuſe it ludiculouſly; tell them, <q>if you were ſure to loſe, you might poſſibly ſit down; but that, as fortune may be favourable, you dread the thought of having too much money, ever ſince you ſound what an incumbrance it was to poor Harlequin, and therefore you are reſolved never to put your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the way of wining more than ſuch or ſuch a ſum a day.</q> This light way of declining invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to vice and foolly is more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a young man than philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical

I would by no means recommend playing of cards as a part of your ſtudy, left you ſhould grow too fond of it, and the conſequences prove bad. It were better not to know a diamond from a club, than to become a gambler; but as cuſtom has introduced inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent card playing at moſt friendly meetings, it marks the gentleman to handle them genteely, and play them well; and as I hope you will play on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſmall ſums, ſhould you loſe your money pray loſe it with temper; or win, receive your winnings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either elation or greedineſs.</p>

I would not have you learn a ſtiff formal hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing, like that of a ſchool-maſter, but a genteel, legible and liberal hand, and to be able to write quick. As to the correctneſs and elegancy of your writing, attention to grammar does the one, and to the beſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, the other.

<pb n="90" facs="unknown:019258_0046_0FAA6993F8FE06E0"/>one falſe ſpelling may fix a ridicule on him for the remainder of his life. Words in books are generally well ſpelled, according to the orthogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of the age; reading, therefore, with attention, will teach every one to ſpell right. It ſometimes happens that words ſhall be ſpelled differently by different authors: but if you ſpell them upon the authority of one, in eſtimation of the public, you will eſcape ridicule. Where there is but one way of ſpelling a word, by your ſpelling it wrong you will be ſure to be laughed at.

The cauſes of nick-names among well-bred men, are generally the little defects in manner, air, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs.

               <p n="9">9. Some young men are apt to think, that they cannot be complete gentlemen, without becoming men of pleaſure; and the rake they often miſtake for the man of pleaſure.

Indeed, he is too often leſs ſcrupulous than he ſhould be, and frequently has cauſe to repent it. A man of pleaſure, at beſt, is but a diſſipated being, and what the rational part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind muſt abhor; I mention it, however, leſt in taking up the man of pleaſure, you ſhould fall into the rake: for of two evils always chuſe the leaſt. A diſſolute, flagitious foot-man may make as good a rake as a man of the firſt quality. Few men can be men of pleaſure; every man may be a rake. There is a certain dignity that ſhould be preſerved in all our pleaſures; in love a man may loſe his heart, without loſing his noſe; at table a man may have a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing palate, without being a glutton; he may love wine without
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:019258_0047_0FAA6994B07D8B30"/>being a drunkard; he may game without being a gambler; and ſo on. Every virtue has its kindred vice, and every pleaſure its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring diſgrace. Temperance and moderation mark the gentleman; but exceſs the blackguard. Attend care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, then, to the line that divides them; and remember, ſtop rather a yard ſhort, than ſtep an inch beyond it. Weigh the preſent enjoyment of your pleaſures againſt the neceſſary conſequences of them, and I will leave you to your own determination.</p>

Mere formal viſits, upon formal invitations are not the thing; they create no connection, nor will they prove of ſervice to you; it is the careleſs and eaſy ingreſs and egreſs, at all hours, that ſecures an acquaintance to our intereſt, and this is acquired by a reſpectful familiarity entered into, without forfeiting your conſequence.</p>

If you cannot be with your former acquaintance ſo often as you uſed to be, while you had no others, take care not to give them cauſe to think you neglect them; call upon them frequently, though you cannot ſtay long with them; tell them you are ſorry to leave them ſo ſoon, and nothing ſhould take you away but certain engagements which good manners oblige you to attend

Another thing worth your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is, if in company with an inferior not to let him feel his inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority; if he diſcovers it himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your endeavours, the fault is not yours, and he will not blame you; but if you take pains to mortify him, or to make him feel himſelf inferior to you in abilities, fortune, or rank, it is an inſult that will not readily be forgiven. In point of abilities, it would be unjuſt, as they are out of his power; in point of rank or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, it is ill natured and ill-bred. This rule is never more neceſſary than at table, where there cannot be a greater inſult than to help an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to a part he diſlikes, or a part that may be worſe than ordinary, and to take the beſt to yourſelf.

I would rather double my attention to ſuch a perſon, and treat him with additional reſpect, leſt he ſhould even ſuppoſe himſelf ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected. There cannot be a greater favagneſs or cruelty, or any thing more degrading to a man of faſhion than to put upon or take unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liberties with him, whoſe modeſty humility or reſpect will not ſuffer him to retaliate. True politeneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in making every body happy about you; and as to mortify is to render unhappy, it can be nothing but the worſt of breeding. Make it a rule, rather to flatter a perſon's vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than otherwiſe; make him if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, more in love with himſelf, and you will be certain to gain his eſteem; never tell him any thing he may not like to hear, nor ſay things that will put him out of countenance, but let it be your ſtudy on all occaſions to pleaſe; this will be making friends

Never be witty, at the expence of any one preſent, nor gratify that idle inclination which is too ſtrong in moſt young men, I mean laughing at or ridiculling the weakneſſes or infirmities of others, by way of divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the company, or diſplaying your own ſuperiority. Moſt people have their weakneſſes their peculiar likings and averſions. Some cannot bear the ſight of a cat; others the ſmell of cheeſe and ſo on; was you to laugh at theſe men for their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathies, or by deſign or inattention to bring them in their way, you could not inſult them more. You may poſſibly thus gain the laugh on your ſide, for the preſent, but it will make the perſon, perhaps, at whoſe expence you are merry your enemy for ever after; and even thoſe who laugh with you, will on a little reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, fear you and probably deſpiſe

If you have wit uſe it to pleaſe but not to hurt. You may ſhine, but take care not to ſcorch. In ſhort, never ſeem to ſee the faults of others. Though among the maſs of men there are doubtleſs, numbers of fools and knaves, yet were we to tell every one of theſe we meet with, that we know them to be ſo, we ſhould be in perpetual war. I would deteſt the knave and pity the fool, wherever I found him, but I would let neither of them know unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily that I did ſo; as I would not be induſtrious to make myſelf enemies.

               <p>

As to a mimick or a wag, he is little elſe than a buffoon, who will diſtort his mouth and his eyes to make people laugh. Be aſſured, no one perſon ever demeaned himſelf to pleaſe the reſt, unleſs he wiſhed to be thought the Merry-Andrew of the company, and whether this character is reſpectable, I will leave you to judge.</p>
               <p>If a man's company is coveted on any other account than his knowledge, his good ſenſe, or his manners, he is ſeldom reſpected by thoſe who invite him, but made uſe of only to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. "Let's have ſuch-a-one, for he ſings a good ſong, or he is always joking or laughing;" or "Let's ſend for ſuch a one, for he is a good bottle companion;" theſe are degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtinctions, that preclude all reſpect and eſteem. Whoever <hi>is had</hi> (as the phraſe is) for the ſake of any qualification ſingly, is merely that thing he <hi>is had</hi> for, is never conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in any other light, and, of
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:019258_0059_0FAA699F329A0E48"/>courſe, never properly reſpected, let his intrinſic merits be what they will.</p>
               <p>You may poſſibly ſuppoſe this dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of manners to border upon pride; but it differs as much from pride, as true courage from bluſtering.</p>
               <p>To flatter a perſon right or wrong, is abject flattery, and to conſent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to do every thing propoſed by a company, be it ſilly or criminal is full as degrading as to diſpute warmly upon every ſubject, and to contradict upon all occaſions. To preſerve dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, we ſhould modeſtly aſſert our own ſentiments, though we politely acquieſce in thoſe of others.</p>
               <p>So again, to ſupport dignity of character, we ſhould neither be frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly curious about trifles, nor be laboriouſly intent upon little objects that deſerve not a moments attention; for this implies an incapacity in matters of greater importance.</p>
               <p>A great deal likewiſe depends upon our air, addreſs and expreſſions; an awkward addreſs and vulgar expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:019258_0059_0FAA699F329A0E48"/>infer either a low turn of mind, or low education.</p>
               <p>Inſolent contempt, or low envy, is incompatible alſo with dignity of manners. Low bred perſons, fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately lifted in the world, in fine cloaths and fine equipages, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolently look down on all thoſe who cannot afford to make as good an appearance, and they openly envy thoſe who perhaps make a better. They alſo dread the being ſlighted; of courſe are ſuſpicious, and captious; are uneaſy themſelves and make eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body elſe ſo about them.</p>
               <p>A certain degree of outward ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in looks and actions gives dignity, while a conſtant ſmirk upon the face (that inſipid ſilly ſmile, which fools have when they would be civil) and whiffling motions, are ſtrong marks of futility.</p>
               <p>But above all a dignity of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is to be acquired beſt by a certain firmneſs in all our actions. A mean,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:019258_0060_0FAA69A011F6A9D0"/>timid and paſſive complaiſance lets a man down more than he is aware of: but ſtill his firmneſs and reſolution ſhould not extend to brutality, but be acompanied with a peculiar and engaging ſofteneſs, or mildneſs.</p>
               <p>If you diſcover any haſtineſs in your temper, and find it apt to break out into rough and unguarded expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, watch it narrowly, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to crub it; but let no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance, no weak deſire of pleaſing, no wheedling urge you to do that which diſcretion forbids; but perſiſt and perſevere in all that is right. In your connections and friendſhips, you will find this rule of uſe to you. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite and preſerve attachments by your firmneſs: but labour to keep clear of enemies, by a mildneſs of behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Diſarm thoſe enemies you may unfortunately have, (and few are without them) by a gentleneſs of manner, but make them feel the ſteadineſs of your juſt reſentment!
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:019258_0060_0FAA69A011F6A9D0"/>for there is a wide difference between bearing malice and a determined ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence; the one is imperious, but the other is prudent and juſtifiable.</p>
               <p>In directing your ſervants, or any perſon you have a right to command; if you deliver your orders mildly, and in that engaging manner which every gentleman ſhould ſtudy to do, you would be chearfully, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well obeyed: but if tyrannically, you would be very unwillingly ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if ſerved at all. A cool, ſteady determination ſhould ſhow that you will be obeyed, but a gentleneſs in the manner of enforcing that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhould make ſervice a chearful one. Thus will you be loved without being deſpiſed, and feared without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hated.</p>
               <p>I hope I need not mention vices. A man who has patiently been kicked out of company, may have as good a pretence to courage, as one rendered infamous by his vices, may to digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:019258_0061_0FAA69A0AC9A4DF0"/>of any kind; however, of ſuch conſequence are appearances, that an outward decency and an affected dignity of manners will even keep ſuch a man the longer from ſinking. If therefore you ſhould unfortunately have no intrinſic merit of your own, keep up, if poſſible, the appearance of it; and the world will poſſibly give you credit for the reſt. A verſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of manners is as neceſſary in ſocial life, as a verſatility of parts in political. This is no way blameable, if not uſed with an ill deſign. We muſt, like the cameleon, often put on the hue of the perſons we wiſh to be well with: and it ſurely can never be blameable, to endeavour to gain the good will or affection of any one, if when obtained, we do not mean to abuſe it.</p>

Nothing can be more rude than to engroſs the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation to yourſelf, or to take the words, as it were, out of another man's mouth. Every man in company has an equal claim to bear his part in the converſation, and to deprive him of it is not only unjuſt, but a tacit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration that he cannot ſpeak ſo well upon the ſubject as yourſelf; you will therefore take it up. And what can be more rude? I would as ſoon forgive a man that ſhould ſtop my mouth when I was gaping, as take my words from me while I was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.
