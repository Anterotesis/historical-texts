            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Relation of the Oppoſition which ſome Baptiſt People met with at <hi>Norwich, 1761,</hi> by the Authority and Miniſter, when they went above ten Miles to confer with the People between their Meeting about the Things of God, upon which Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition they went in the Middle of the Week on Purpoſe to deſire ſaid Miniſter to appoint a Day to diſcourſe with one of them before the People. In particular they deſired Liberty to ſhew by the Scripture that the Firſt Day of the Week is not the <hi>Chriſtian Sabbath,</hi> and to ſhew by the Scripture what the Chriſtian Reſt or Chriſtian Sabbath is: And how Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper ought to be adminiſtered, and what they are Figures of. And alſo to ſhew ſome Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Marks for People to know the Followers of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by, and ſome Scripture Marks to know falſe Teachers by. But ſaid Miniſter would not hear to it, but inſtead, turned them cut of his Houſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have here ſhewed in Print what they deſired to ſhew by diſputing with him as followeth.</head>
            <p>WE appointed to go to <hi>Norwich</hi> Town, to have ſome Conference with the People between their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, about the Things of God, and it happened that ſome of us came before the Forenoon Meeting began, and ſat down near the Meeting-houſe; when a Conſtable came and aſked us if we came to make a Diſturbance, one of us anſwered he came to teſtify againſt the Idol Sabbath; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid we did not come to make any Diſturbance. The Conſtable went away, and preſently came again, and made Priſoners of us, ſetting Men to keep us at the Tavern; and before the Forenoon Meeting was done, the reſt of us came to the Meeting-houſe, and when their Miniſter <hi>Lord</hi> had done ſpeaking, we went within the Door and deſired them to hear us read a Paper, but one anſwered we don't want to hear it; ſo we went out, and deſired them to hear it there, but the Conſtable with others laid hold of us, and ſet

eighteen, and when it was dark Night the Conſtable came and ſaid, I have prevented your making a Diſturbance To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and now you are at Liberty.</p>
            <p>So we being diſappointed of conferring with the People about the Things of God this Time, we appointed to go again, but it being a ſtormy Day, but few went, and the Forenoon Meeting was done, and the People gone before they came; ſo we went to a Tavern where a Juſtice came to us before the Afternoon Meeting began, and aſked if we were going to the Meeting, we anſwered we did not know that we ſhould, and he immediately ordered Men to keep us, and when it was dark Night he came again and told us we were at Liberty; and ſaid you would not like we ſhould come to diſturb you at your Meeting: We anſwered, it would be wrong to come to diſturb, but we ſhould be glad if you would come to our Meeting as we come to yours, to diſcourſe of the Things of God; and we are willing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a Meeting in this Town on Purpoſe to diſcourſe with us, and we went directly to their Miniſter <hi>Lord</hi>'s Houſe, to deſire him to diſcourſe with us in the Week Time before the People, about their Sabbath; but before we could well inform him what we came for, he ſaid I have nothing to do with you, and commanded us out, calling us unreaſonable Men, but which was the unreaſonable Man, let the Reader judge.</p>
            <p>The next firſt Day of the Week we went again, and ſat down in the Meeting houſe 'till ſaid Lord had done ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and one of us beginning to ſpeak, a Juſtice told the People to diſperſe, and ſaid Lord their Miniſter told them it would prophane the Sabbath of the great God, for them to ſtop and hear us, calling us Praters, and when one of us ſaid it is not the Sabbath of God, he anſwered, you are Madmen. And conſidering the Scripture teaches us to ſpeak in the Light which God hath made known to us, and not to hide it under a Buſhel, we judged it beſt to diſpute with this Miniſter before the People, that it might be made manifeſt by the Scripture who were the Praters, that prate contrary to Scripture, he or we, and accordingly our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt was written and carried to his Houſe by <hi>Joſeph Bolles</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:008802_0003_102FCB409ECF4C70"/>
and others with him: and we told our Buſineſs and read the Paper to ſeveral Juſtices and many others of his Society, and many liked it very well, and not one was offended, while we came to him in his Houſe; and before ſaid <hi>Bolles</hi> could half do this Errand to this pretended Miniſter of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he bid them go out, <hi>Bolles</hi> inſiſted to read ſaid Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to inform what they deſired, he ſaid I will not hear it; and before <hi>Bolles</hi> could read one Word, this pretended Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> puſhed him with both Hands looking very angry, and ſo puſht the reſt while he got them all out of his Houſe.</p>
            <p>Now let us conſider how unreaſonable this pretended Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was. They had blamed us much for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their pretended Sabbath, ſaying we ſhould come an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Day to ſpeak to them, and every Time we came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this to ſpeak to them between their Meetings, we were carried Priſoners away from the People, except when the People were ordered to go from us and not hear us. And now when we came above ten Miles to ſpeak with him in the Middle of the Week, he would not ſuffer it, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us out of the Houſe, and puſhed us with both Hands while he got us out. Surely he was not able by ſound Doctrine to exhort and convince the Gain-ſayers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Tit.</hi> i. 9. and therefore he took another Courſe. If the Scripture was of his Side to confute us, why did he turn us out of his Houſe? Our Buſineſs was to have a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with him before his own People, that it might come to Light by the Scripture who followed <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he or we; but he would not hear it becauſe his Deeds were evil, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> affirms <hi>John</hi> iii. 20, 21. <hi>Every one that doth Evil hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light leſt his Deeds ſhould be reproved: but he that doth Truth cometh to the Light, that his Deeds may be made manifeſt that they are wrought in God.</hi> We read that <hi>Paul</hi> diſputed daily Months and Years, <hi>Acts</hi> ix, he diſputed in the Synagogue and in the Market daily with them that met with him, <hi>Acts</hi> xvii: 17. Alſo he diſputed againſt the <hi>Grecians,</hi> but they went about to ſlay him, <hi>Acts</hi> ij. 29. Thus it was <hi>Paul</hi>'s Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to diſpute, and it was the Practice of Deceivers to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008802_0004_102FCB4241AD5628"/>
him, they went about to ſlay him. <hi>Paul</hi> diſputed that it might be made manifeſt that his Deeds were wrought in God; but he that doth Evil hates to diſpute leſt his evil Deeds ſhould be reproved. Alſo 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 24. <hi>The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle unto all Men, apt to teach, in Meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 15. <hi>Be ready always to give an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to every Man that aſketh you a Reaſon of the Hope that is in you.</hi> But this pretended Miniſter of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is never ready to anſwer us as we can find, for we have lately been three Times at his Houſe, and he has commanded us out every Time, It was ſaid of <hi>Nabal,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxv. 17, <hi>He is ſuch a Son of Belial that a Man cannot ſpeak to him.</hi>— Paul <hi>dwelt two whole Years in his own hired Houſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all that came in unto him.</hi> Acts xxviii. 30. So that he turned none out of his Houſe to ſhun a Diſpute. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid <hi>Be ye Followers of me even as I am of Chriſt.</hi> So that Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ought to be forward to diſpute as <hi>Paul</hi> was, and not turn them out of his Houſe when they come to diſcourſe with him.</p>
            <p>And here follows a Copy of ſaid Paper which ſaid <hi>Lord</hi> ſaid he would not hear. <hi>Norwich,</hi> the 22d of the fourth Month, 1761. Conſidering we have ſundry Times, within ſix Weeks, travelled many Miles to this Town, to ſpeak a few Words to the People, between their Meetings, of Things that God hath enlightened us, and have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the Authority and Miniſter, twice we have been kept Priſoners while dark Night, the next Time we waited in the Meeting-houſe while <hi>Benjamin Lord</hi> had done ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and one of us beginning to ſpeak, ſaid <hi>Lord</hi> told the People it would prophane the Sabbath of the great God for them to ſtop and hear us, calling us Praters; and when one of us ſaid this is not the Sabbath of God, he ſaid you are Madmen. Therefore ſeeing he does not allow the People to hear us ſpeak of the Things of God on his pretended Sabbath, we deſired Liberty to ſhew by the Scripture that the firſt Day of the Week is not the Chriſtian Sabbath; and to ſhew by the Scripture what the Chriſtian Reſt or Sabbath is; and how Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper ought to be
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008802_0005_102FCB43D23B34B0"/>
adminiſtered, and what they are Figures of. And alſo to ſhew ſome Scripture Marks, for People to know the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by; and ſome Scripture Marks to know falſe Teachers by. And if we ſay any thing contrary to Scripture, let him make it manifeſt to the People before us.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we ſhall ſhew that the firſt Day of the Week is not the Chriſtian Sabbath, whereas Friend <hi>Lord</hi> called the firſt Day of the Week the Sabbath of the great God, he is under a groſs Miſtake, for the Scripture ſays, <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 15. <hi>where no Law is, there is no Tranſgreſſion.</hi> And God has no Law in the Scripture to keep that Day for a Sabbath, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not the Sabbath of the great God, but only the Sabbath of the God of this World, as the Scripture ſays, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 4. <hi>The God of this World hath blinded the Minds of them which believe not, leſt the Light of the glorious Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt, who is the Image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi> Alſo the Confeſſion of Faith of this Colony, ſays in p. 7. <hi>Believe in all divine Worſhip, it is not enough that this or that Act of Worſhip is not forbidden in the Word of God, if it be not commanded and you perform it, you may fear you will be found guilty.</hi> So that Friend <hi>Lord</hi> may fear he will be found guilty for keeping his pretended Sabbath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, according to his own Confeſſion of Faith. Becauſe it is not commanded in the Word of God, Alſo it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it ſhould be the Chriſtian Sabbath, becauſe it is no where called Sabbath in Scripture, but called the firſt Day of the Week, in <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xvi. 2. and <hi>John</hi> xx. 1 and 19. And there is not one Word about its being a Sabbath in Scripture, therefore it is evident they knew not it was a <hi>Sabbath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for if they had known it was a Sabbath, they would have called it ſo, and not always call it the firſt Day of the Week. Alſo <hi>Mat.</hi> xxviii. when <hi>Chriſt</hi> left his Apoſtles, he charged them to teach all Nations, to obſerve all Things whatſoever he had commanded them; and they have no where in all the New Teſtament taught one of the Nations to obſerve this pretended Sabbath: But, <hi>Rom.</hi> xiv. the Apoſtle commanded the Church not to judge him that eſteemed one Day above another, conſidering he regarded it to the Lord. Yet he was afraid of them that obſerve

Days, leaſt he had beſtowed upon them Labour in vain. <hi>Gal.</hi> iv. 10, 11. <hi>Ye obſerve Days and Months, and Times and Years, and I am afraid of you, leſt I have beſtowed La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vain.</hi> Obſerve, he was as much againſt obſerving Days as he was againſt obſerving Months and Years; by all which it is evident he did not obſerve Days himſelf. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it was Days commanded in the Old Teſtament that ſome of the Church was enſnared about. But the firſt Day of the Week was never commanded, nor nothing ſaid about keeping of it in all the Scripture. And the Apoſtle ſpake againſt obſerving any Day. And he alſo ſays, <hi>Gal.</hi> i. 8.9. <hi>Tho' we or an Angel from Heaven preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accurſed. As we ſaid before, ſo ſay I now again, If any Man preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that ye have received, let him be accurſed.</hi> Therefore how can the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Miniſter of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that preach that this pretended Sabbath ought to be kept, in ſuch a ſuperſtitious manner, eſcape this Curſe. And is not this pretended Sabbath an accurſed Thing alſo; eſpecially conſidering the Perſecution that is uſed to force the Children of God to keep it, by ſpoiling their Goods, impriſoning and torturing their Bodies by whipping, not exceeding twenty Stripes, if they refuſe to pay ten Shillings for working on this pretended Sabbath. And is not this Law a Work of the Devil, to torture the Body with twenty Stripes, and to force a Perſon to pay ten ſhillings or comply with this wicked Sabbath, againſt a Man's Conſcience, when he knows it is not God's Sabbath, and therefore it will be a great ſin for him, either to keep it, or to pay ten ſhillings. And we do eſteem this <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min Lord</hi> to be a hardened Perſecutor; for while he has been a Preacher where he now is, we have been cruelly whipt for pretended Breach of Sabbath, eight at one time, near his Houſe, and we underſtood he looked on and liked it very well; and ſmaller Numbers have been whipt ſeveral other Times; and it was all for going through <hi>Norwich</hi> to our appointed Meeting at <hi>Lebanon</hi> on the firſt Day of the Week, and we endured it with the Help of God, while the Authority forbore whipping and let us paſs without.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008802_0007_102FEEF42FBD7368"/>
This might have been Conviction enough to him that God was with us in our Sufferings, if he had been ſo much as a Babe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and he has not ſhewed us one Word of Scripture about keeping ſaid pretended Sabbath to this Day, and yet calls it the Sabbath of the great God. And when we go to deſire him to prove it by Scripture, he commands and puſhes us out of his Houſe. Alſo he has proved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ſuch a one as we read of in <hi>Micah</hi> iii. 5. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, concerning the Prophets that make my People err, that bite with their Teeth, and cry Peace; and he that putteth not into their Mouth, they even prepare War againſt him.</hi> This appears by many that have been lain in Priſon, to force them to pay Money for his preaching when they did not hear him, and profeſſed it to be againſt their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. If <hi>Benjamin Lord</hi> will ſhew us one Verſe in the Bible that ſays one Word about keeping the firſt Day of the Week for a Sabbath, he ſhall have ten Pounds law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Money Reward for his Trouble, paid by us or either of us,

We deſire Friend <hi>Lord</hi> may not pretend himſelf unwilling to take ten Pounds for ſhewing the Scripture for his pretended Sabbath, for it ſeems to us he will earn his Money dear enough, and we will pay him honeſtly; if we neglect, it will be more for his Honour to caſt us into Priſon, than many others which have lain there when they owed him nothing, but only for vain preaching or prating.

So in this popiſh Darkneſs they got into <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Seat, and made many Laws while it is got to be ſuch an Idol, that Friend <hi>Lord</hi> pretends it will prophane it for his People to hear us ſpeak of the Things of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween Meetings, tho' they came on Purpoſe to hear of the Things of God. Alſo the Authority orders the People away; and this is contrary to ſcripture, for Chriſtians to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Authority over one another in matters of Religion, <hi>Matt.</hi> xx. 25. <hi>Jeſus called them unto him and ſaid, ye know that the Princes of the Gentiles exerciſe Dominion over them, and they that are great, exerciſe authority upon them: but it ſhall not be ſo among you; but whoſoever will be great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, let him be your Miniſter; and whoſoever will be chief among you, let him be your ſervant; even as the ſon of Man came not to be adminiſtered unto, but to miniſter, and to give his Life a Ranſom for many.</hi> Luke xxii. 25.</p>

And whereas he ſays, take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in Heart; that is, to take up our Croſs and follow him, and ſo learn to be meek and lowly in Heart, as he is, and in ſo doing we ſhall find reſt to our Souls. And further he ſays, for my Yoke is eaſy and my Burden is light; that is, when we have taken up our Croſs, as he will teach us, and ſo learned of him, to be meek and lowly in Heart, then we ſhall ſee, that his Yoke is eaſy, and his Burden is light. And there is no other Sabbath to be kept, ſince Chriſt ſuffered on the Croſs, but this reſt to our Souls, which the ſeventh Day reſt was the Sign of; and if we repent, and ſeek him with the whole Heart, while we receive the remiſſion of our Sins, and the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, we ſhall ſee it is a glorious Reſt, which will ſatisfy the hungry Soul. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Bleſſed are they which do hunger and thirſt after Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled.</hi> alſo, <hi>Iſai.</hi> xi, 10. <hi>There ſhall be a Root of Jeſſe, which ſhall ſtand for an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to the People, to it ſhall the Gentiles ſeek, and his Reſt ſhall be glorious.</hi> Now, this Reſt which <hi>Chriſt</hi> gives his Children, far exceeds the ſeventh Day reſt, which was only a Sign of this glorious Reſt or Sabbath; and all that worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth, do find this Reſt or Sabbath in their Souls.

            <p>
               <hi>Concerning Baptiſm.</hi> Baptiſm is call'd a Figure. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18 <hi>to</hi> 22. <hi>Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for Sins, the Juſt for the Unjuſt, that he might bring us to God; being put to Death in the Fleſh, but quickened by the Spirit.</hi> And he further ſays, <hi>By which alſo he went and preach'd unto the Spirits in Priſon, which ſometime were diſobedient, when once the long-ſuffering of God waited in the Days of Noah while the Ark was preparing.</hi> So it was by Virtue of Chriſt ſuffering for our Sins, that he might bring us to God, that he preached or ſtrived by his Spirit, with the Spirits of Men, while the Ark was preparing; and they are ſaid to be in Priſon, becauſe God had ſaid his Spirit ſhould not always ſtrive with them, yet he allowed them an hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008802_0011_102FEEFC8F1BA148"/>
Years, while the Ark was preparing, and while his long ſuffering waited for them to repent, and to have their Sins forgiven, that ſo he might bring them to God, that their Spirits might be reconciled to him, before their Bodies were deſtroyed by the Flood. And he further ſays, <hi>Wherein few, that is eight Souls, were ſaved by Water; the like Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, whereunto even Baptiſm doth alſo now ſave us: not the putting away the Filth of the Fleſh; but the Anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Whereas he ſays, the like Figure, he aludes from the deſtruction of the old World, and the Salvation of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Houſe by Water, which was a Figure of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Salvation by Chriſt the promiſed Seed to come, who was to be her Head, and the Saviour of her Body: Baptiſm ſays he, <hi>is the like Figure,</hi> ſo that he ſpeaks of Baptiſm, as it is a Figure delivered to the Church, now ſaveth us faith he: that is, it is a Figure of our Salvation by Chriſt: he ſpeaks by the Figure as Chriſt does in the like Caſe, when he gave his Diſciples the Bread and Wine, which were but Figures, ſaying, <hi>This is my Body which is broken for you:</hi> And when he gave them the Cup of Wine, he ſaid, <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſtament which is ſhed for many.</hi> Yet they were but Figures of his Body and Blood, as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is a Figure of our Salvation by the reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> not, ſaith Peter, <hi>the putting away the Filth of the Fleſh,</hi> that is, the Figure only waſheth the outward Man, but we have the anſwer of a good Conſcience by the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which Baptiſm is a Figure of. But the waſhing of the Filth of the Fleſh, is only the Work of the Figure, and the Figure is to point out how we come by this Baptiſm, which cleanſeth us from our Sins; for it is not ſufficient for us to know that it is the Spirit that baptiſeth us from our Sins, but the main Thing is to know how we came by the Gift of the Spirit, and this Knowledge is to be guided by the Figure; for <hi>Peter</hi> telleth us in <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>that Chriſt was put to Death in the Fleſh, that he might bring us to God.</hi> So we come to ceaſe from Sin by his ſuffering in the Fleſh for us. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iv. 1. <hi>He alſo being quickened by the Spirit, and ſo raiſed from the Dead by this Reſurrection of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008802_0012_102FEEFEFAA0D9A0"/>
us:</hi> and thus we come to have a good Conſcience towards God, by the reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> ſo that our good Conſcience comes by our Spiritual Baptiſm, and our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Baptiſm comes by the reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> had received his Sight, and was filled with the Holy Ghoſt, the Lord ſaid by the Mouth of <hi>Ananias, why tarrieſt thou, ariſe and be baptiſed.</hi> And when the Holy Ghoſt fell upon <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Houſe, the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them by the Mouth of <hi>Peter,</hi> whom he ſent to teach them, to be baptiſed: and <hi>Peter</hi> makes a Challenge by Way of queſtion, ſaying, <hi>Can any Man forbid Water, that theſe ſhould not be baptiſed which have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we.</hi> So he that the Lord ſent to teach them what to do, upon this very Reaſon, of ſeeing them baptiſed with the Holy Ghoſt, commands them to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, and it is evident with Water.</p>
            <p>Baptiſm is a Figure that thro' the Death and Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt</hi> we die to ſin; and are raiſed up together with him to Newneſs of Life, having a ſenſe and feeling in ourſelves of what the ſcriptures teſtify concerning <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> being that one ſacrifice for ſin by the Effects of the ſuffering of of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> operating in us, which mortifies and kills ſin in us, and in his Name quickens and raiſes us up to Newneſs of Life. So the outward Figure repreſents, that the Death and Burial of our Body of Sin comes by the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for our Sins: alſo the Reſurrection of the Body, which alſo comes by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is held forth by this Ordinance, as appears <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 3, 4, 6. <hi>So many of us as were baptiſed into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptiſed into his Death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the Dead by the Glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in Newneſs of Life; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, that our old Man is crucified with him, that the Body of Sin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve Sin.</hi> Alſo <hi>Col.</hi> ii. 12. <hi>Buried with him in Baptiſm, wherein we are alſo riſen with him through the Faith of the Operation of God, who hath raiſed him from the Dead.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, we are riſen with him to Newneſs of Life by witneſſing the Operation of God in us. Alſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 29. <hi>Elſe what ſhall they do which are baptiſed for the Dead,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008802_0013_102FEF035EE52E00"/>
if the Dead riſe not at all, why are they then baptiſed for the Dead.</hi> So Baptiſm ſignifies our riſing from the Dead. Thus it appears that the Figure ſhould be adminiſtered by a Burial in the Water, it being a Figure of our Death to Sin, by the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for our Sins; and alſo a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection to Newneſs of Life, by the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and a Figure alſo of the Death and Reſurrection of our Body, which comes by <hi>Chriſt. Paul</hi> ſays, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 1, 2. <hi>Be ye Followers of me, even as I alſo am of Chriſt. Now I pray you, Brethren, that you remember in all Things and keep the Ordinances as I delivered them to you.</hi> And we read this Ordinance of Baptiſm was delivered to the Church by adminiſtering where there was much Water. <hi>Mark</hi> i. 5. <hi>There went out unto him all the Land of Judea, and they of Jeruſalem, and were all baptiſed of him in the River of Jordan, confeſſing their Sins.</hi> Now let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Need there was for all the Country to go <hi>Jordan</hi> where there was much Water, if it would pleaſe God to ſprinkle a little Water in the Face, as the pretended Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of <hi>Chriſt</hi> do now. The Scripture ſays they were all baptiſed of <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Jordan.</hi> Baptiſe is a <hi>Greek</hi> Word, in <hi>Engliſh</hi> it is waſh or dip, as by the Dictionary appears. So they were all waſhed or dipped in Water, even in <hi>Jordan. Acts</hi> viii. 38. <hi>They went down both into the Water, both Philip and the Eunuch, and he baptiſed him.</hi> Alſo <hi>John</hi> iii. 23. <hi>John alſo was baptiſing in Enon near to Salem, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was much Water there; and Jeſus was baptiſed of John in Jordan. Mark</hi> 1.9. And ſeeing they all took the Pains to go where there was much Water, and were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in the Water, and our Lord himſelf was baptiſed in <hi>Jordan,</hi> and came up out of the Water; how can we think that we follow <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if we are aſhamed to take up our Croſs and do as he has done; and how does it look for a pretended Miniſter of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to ſprinkle a few Drops of Water in the Face, and ſay it will do as well, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit himſelf wiſer than <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Apoſtles; neither is it a true Reſemblance or Figure of the Spiritual Baptiſm, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it an Inſtitution of God, but rather a mocking of God, neither do we perceive that God owns it by giving
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008802_0014_102FEF05D53CB4E0"/>
the Holy Ghoſt to them that come under that invented Baptiſm; alſo to baptiſe Infants, that know not what they are about, without Scripture Example. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> xxviii. 19, 20. <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and Holy Ghoſt; teaching them to obſerve all Things whatſoever I have commanded you, and lo! I am with you alway, even unto the End of the World, Amen.</hi> So that if his Followers obſerve all Things whatſoever he has commanded, he has promiſed to be with them alway, even unto the End of the World: and alſo ſaith Amen; that is, verily ſo be it. Alſo <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 38. <hi>Peter ſaid unto them, repent and be baptiſed every one of you, in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sins, and ye ſhall receive the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And we can truly teſtify that this promiſe is fulfilled among us, as fully as it is written: And this we write for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that we do know that he fulfils his Promiſe, made by the Mouth of his Apoſtles, and for encouragement to all them that will take up their Croſs and follow him. <hi>Heb.</hi> xiii. 12, 13, 14. <hi>Wherefore Jeſus alſo, that he might ſanctify the People with his own Blood, ſuffered without the Gate: let us go forth therefore unto him without the Camp, bearing his reproach; for here have we no continuing City, but we ſeek one to come.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 12, 13. <hi>Yea, and all that will live Godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution, but evil Men and Seducers ſhall wax worſe and worſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and being deceived.</hi>

               <hi>Concerning the Lord's Supper.</hi> When God delivered his People out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he ordained an Ordinance in his Church called the Lord's Paſſover, which Ordinance did point at <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was the real Lamb of God, figured out by that Ordinance, which was to guide the Faith of God's Church to the promiſed Seed of the Woman, till he ſhould come. Which Ordinance continued in the Church, till it was fulfilled in the Kingdom of God; for in that very Night in which <hi>Jeſus</hi> eat that Paſſover with his Diſciples, he was betrayed, tho' he freely offered up himſelf for our Sins, that he might redeem us from our vain Converſations: And in the Time of his eating that Paſſover with his Diſciples,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008802_0015_102FEF084F54D5D0"/>
he inſtituted a new Goſpel Ordinance, to guide the Faith of his Church in himſelf, as being already come, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 7. <hi>For even Chriſt our Paſſover is ſacrificed for us.</hi> He having thus once appeared by the ſacrifice of himſelf, to put away ſin, hath left an Ordinance with his Church called the Lord's ſupper, to be obſerved by his Church, till he ſhall appear a ſecond Time, without ſin to ſalvation: in his firſt Appearance he was made ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him, and all the ſacrifices for ſin before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was to guide the Faith of his Church to this one ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which they all pointed at, that the Church of God might believe and know by theſe Ordinances before appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, that God had ordained them another Head in the Room of <hi>Adam,</hi> who by his Diſobedience brought Death and Miſery upon himſelf, and upon all his Poſterity; but by the righteous Life, bitter Death, and glorious Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of this ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> a reſurrection from Sin, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and Death, is brought to Light: So that this Lamb of God is the one and only Sacrifice for our Sins, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 18, &amp;c. <hi>Foraſmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as Silver and Gold, from your vain Converſation, but with the precious Blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without Blemiſh, and without Spot; who ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the World.</hi> God choſe us in him our Head, before the Foundation of the World, and by his free Grace called us in him, that we ſhould be Holy, by being made Partaker of that Holineſs, which was with him before the Foundation of the World was laid; and therefore the Lamb of God that was ſacrificed for us, is worthy to receive Power, Riches, Wiſdom, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Glory, and Strength, for he was ſlain for us, and hath purchaſed for us the true and living Bread of Life; and our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> at the Ceſſation of that Paſſover, which was to guide the Faith of his Church in him that was to come, till he ſhould come and fulfil that Ordinance, by the Sacrifice of himſelf, hath ſettled a New Teſtament Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance in his Church, to ſhew forth his Death, till he ſhall come a ſecond Time in Glory: This Ordinance is to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008802_0016_102FEF0AE214EE08"/>
ſhew, that his Church hath the Remiſſion of Sins by ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his Blood, and to ſhew and to keep in Memory, that the Bread of Life which is given us, is purchaſed for us by his bitter Death, that his Church may aſcribe that Glory to him which is due to him, who hath purchaſed theſe Things for us at ſo dear a Rate; ſo this Ordinance is not ſo much to ſet forth the Gift, as it is to ſet forth the Price that purchaſed the Gift for us; for if a Man will give his own Life to ſave the Life of his Friend, this is a Price of great Value worth the Conſideration; but <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath laid down his Life to redeem ours while we were his Enemies. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 23, &amp;c. <hi>I have received of the Lord, that which alſo I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jeſus, the ſame Night in which he was betrayed, took Bread, and when he had given Thanks, brake it, and ſaid, take eat, this is my Body which is broken for you, this do in remembrance of me. After the ſame Manner alſo, he took the Cup after he had ſupped, ſaying, this Cup is the new Teſtament in my Blood, this do as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me; for as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's Death till he come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> they offered the Blood of Beaſts, to guide the Faith of God's Elect to this Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is the Subſtance. And our <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> hath left this Ordinance with his Church, to guide her Faith in his Blood already ſhed for us, ſaying, <hi>This do in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me.</hi> And ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>As often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew his Death 'till he come.</hi> And this Coming the Apoſtle does not mean to be in his divine Nature, but in our Nature as he offered himſelf. For it was the coming of him who had been dead that this Ordinance directed their Faith to for a ſecond Time; for he ſays to thoſe very Perſons, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiii. 5, <hi>Examine yourſelves whether you be in the Faith, prove your ownſelves, know you not your ownſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except you be Reprobates?</hi> Here it appears that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was with them and in them at this very Time of his divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, except ſuch as were Reprobates.

            <p>One principal Mark given by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for all Men to know his Diſciples, was by their loving one another as he had loved them. <hi>John</hi> xiii. 34, 35. <hi>A new Commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another, as I have loved you; that ye alſo love one another; by this ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have Love one for another.</hi> And he calls this his new Commandment, for them to love one another as he had loved them. We may obſerve, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave his Diſciples this new Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when the Hour was come that he ſhould depart out of this World unto the Father, as appears ver. 1. <hi>When Jeſus knew that his Hour was come, that he ſhould depart out of this World unto the Father.</hi> And in theſe xiii, xiv, and xv. Chapters, he ſeveral Times charged them to love one another, and to bear Fruit alſo: but here firſt it ſays, <hi>When Jeſus knew that his Hour was come, that he ſhould depart out of this World unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the World, he loved them unto the End.</hi> The End here ſpoken of, was the End of his being with them in the World: for his Hour was come now to depart out of this

World. And this Text teſtifies that he loved them unto the End; meaning the End of his being with them to the End of the World, And alſo informs us, how he taught them to bear the Fruit of his Love one to another, after he departed from them out of this World unto the Father, as appears ver. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Jeſus knowing that the Father had given all Things into his Hand, and that he was come from God, and went to God, he riſeth from Supper, and laid aſide his Garment, and took a Towel, and girded himſelf; after that he poureth Water into a Baſon, and began to waſh the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples Feet, and to wipe them with the Towel wherewith he was girded.</hi> All this was to teach them, or rather to teach us to be ſubject to and ſerve one another in Meekneſs and Love, and eſpecially in all Long-ſuffering and Doctrine, to edify one another in the Ways of God, as he had done to them; as appears ver. 12. And ſo after he had waſhed their Feet, and had taken his Garments and was ſat again, he ſaid unto them, <hi>Know ye what I have done to you; ye call me Maſter and Lord, and ye ſay well; for I am: if I then your Lord and Maſter have waſhed your Feet, ye alſo ought to waſh one another's Feet; for I have given you an Example that ye ſhould do as I have done to you.</hi> And conſidering <hi>Chriſt</hi> at his departing, has ſo much in theſe three Chapters commanded his Diſciples to love one another, as he had loved them, and gave ſuch an Example of ſerving them in the meaneſt ſervice in the World, even to waſh their Feet; and afterwards told them what he did it for; therefore we ought to take this as a ſolemn Charge for us to love one another as he has loved us, and ſerve one another, as he meant to teach us, by waſhing the Diſciples Feet. And if we ſerve and love one another, as he meant to teach us, he affirms, that all Men ſhall know by this that we are his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Alſo 1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 16. <hi>Hereby perceive we the Love of God, becauſe he laid down his Life for us, and we ought to lay down our Lives for the Brethren.</hi> The Scripture and Hiſtory alſo ſhews, that the Faithful did hazard and lay down their Lives one for another, in Times of Perſecution; and when Brethren hazard and lay down their Lives one for another now, it is a Mark to know that they follow <hi>Chriſt,</hi>

as much as it was then. So then we ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain viſiting, edifying, communicating or ſpeaking to the Children of God, if they are ſick, or in Priſon, or at their Meeting-houſe, for Fear of the Laws and Puniſhment of Men, <hi>Matt.</hi> x. 39 to 42. <hi>Matt.</hi> xxv. 34 to 46. And in ſo doing, we bear the Fruit which he requires of us, even the Fruit of his Commandment, to love one another as he has loved us; and it is by the Fruit which we bear, that we are to know ourſelves, and alſo to know falſe Prophets. <hi>Mat.</hi> vii. 15. <hi>Beware of falſe Prophets, which come to you in Sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening Wolves; ye ſhall know them by their Fruits</hi> ver. 20. <hi>Wherefore by their Fruits ye ſhall know them.</hi> Therefore we are to try their Fruits by the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

We read that <hi>Paul</hi> taught the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to feed the Church of God, which he had purchaſed with his own Blood, and to labour with their Hands, and to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Givers than Receivers. <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 17 to 38, he ſays, <hi>Take Heed therefore unto yourſelves, and to all the Flock over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own Blood.</hi> Again, <hi>You yourſelves know that theſe Hands have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered to my Neceſſities, and to them that were with me. I have ſhewed you all Things, how that ſo labouring, ye ought to ſupport the Weak, and to remember the Words of the Lord Jeſus, how he ſaid it is more bleſſed to give than to receive.</hi> Here are two ſpecial Things for us to obſerve; the firſt is the Apoſtles's Command, that ſo labouring, meaning as he had done, ye ought to ſupport the Weak; alſo to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Words of the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> how he ſaid, it is more bleſſed to give than to receive. Here we ſee, that ſettled Elders are taught to labour with their Hands, and to give rather than receive. But travelling Miniſters, ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> had Power to forbear working, and it is the Duty of other Chriſtians to be Fellow Helpers to the Truth by ſupplying ſuch in their Need, as appears 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix.

Ver. 6, 7, ſaith he, <hi>I only and Barnabas, have not we Power to forbear working? Who goeth a Warfare at any Time at his own Charges?</hi> But the Scripture ſhews, <hi>Paul</hi> labour'd with his Hands at all Opportunities, to make the Goſpel without Charge, and commanded other Chriſtians, ſaying, <hi>Be ye Followers of me, even as I alſo am of Chriſt.</hi> Alſo we read <hi>Matt.</hi> x. with <hi>Luke</hi> x. that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſent forth his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to preach, and to heal the ſick, cleanſe the Lepers, raiſe the Dead, and to caſt out Devil and ſaid unto them, <hi>Freely ye have received, freely give.</hi> So he forbid them tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing for preaching or healing; for he commanded them to give it freely. But as they were Travelling Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, he ſaid unto them, <hi>Eat and drink ſuch Things as they give;</hi> and as he ſaid, <hi>the Labourer is worthy of his Hire,</hi> we ought to conſider they were <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Labourers; he ſent them to labour in his Harveſt, and they were to look to him for their Hire. They were to walk by Faith and not by Sight, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 7. As they had freely received, they were commanded freely to give their preaching and healing. Thus we may obſerve, that both <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> commanded Teachers to receive nothing for teaching, they received freely and they were freely to give; and ſo they were Followers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and became Servants to all Men, in Love ſerving one another, and laid down their Lives for the Brethren. Alſo their Kingdom is not of this World, and they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to receive the Things of this World for preaching the Goſpel. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Apoſtles went about healing and preaching, if it had been right, and they had ſuffered themſelves to receive Gifts, no Doubt but they might have received much. But <hi>Chriſt</hi> was called a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, and had no where to lay his Head; and <hi>Paul</hi> was a Tent-maker, and the Apoſtles were Fiſhermen, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured with their Hands, and had no certain Dwelling-place, as appears 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
