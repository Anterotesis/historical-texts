            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is as fooliſh and fatal as it is common, for Mankind, in general, to go on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly and ſecurely, if they have but an outward Reformation; without Examining their State towards God, and the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their Action.</p>
            <p>Is it poſſible, that Men's Actions ſhould be ſpiritually good, when their State towards GOD, and the Springs of their Action, are bad? What can an unjuſtify'd Perſon do who is an Enemy to GOD, that ſhall be acceptable to the God he hates? Can thoſe that are in the Fleſh pleaſe God? No, ſurely! Is it not the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of wiſe Builders to lay the Foundation firſt? But, alas! the very Contrary is the common Courſe of the World. They ſuppoſe, without Examination and Reaſon, that their Foundation is good; and ſo vainly attempt to build upon the Sand. They carefully ſtrive from time to time to mend and patch their Practices; and if they can get that done, they are eaſy in the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Cleanneſs of the outſide of the Cup and Platter; altho' they know nothing of getting into a new State by Juſtification, or of obtaining new Principles by Regeneration.</p>
            <p>It is for a Lamentation, that the moſt of People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the wrong End of Religion; they attempt to grow in Grace, before they get Grace, and to bring forth living Fruit, before they have a living Principle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:004824_0003_100DF86B77FF4808"/>
O! how hard is it to call fooliſh Sinners back from their empty, airy Fabricks, to an impartial Tryal of their States and Principles, that they may lay a firm Foundation that will ſtand all Weathers; without which all their wild Grapes, and dead Performances will but ſerve with the greater Eaſe and Magnificence to lead their deluded Souls into everlaſting Burnings. No doubt, it is their Ignorance and love of Reſt which make them ſo averſe to examine their States; which is notwithſtanding of ſuch vaſt Neceſſity.</p>
            <p>To promote this, I have therefore determined to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at this Time upon Juſtification; which, as <hi>Luther</hi> juſtly obſerves, <hi>Is the Article of a ſtanding or falling Church:</hi> It is undoubtedly a fundamental Truth of the Chriſtian Religion; For, <hi>no other Foundation can any Man lay, ſave that which is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This, the Apoſtle, after a long Train of cloſe Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, concludes to be <hi>by Faith, without the Deeds of the Law, i. e.</hi> by Faith, as an Inſtrument applying the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to the Soul; for which alone the Sinner is juſtified, without any Mixture of our Obedience to the moral Law join'd with it, as a deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Cauſe thereof.</p>
            <p>But, to make this more plain, I would diſcourſe upon the two following Heads, <hi>namely:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>I would endeavour to open the Nature of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Prove that it cannot be by the Works of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The</p>
            <p n="1">I. GENERAL HEAD to be ſpoken upon, is, to open the Nature of Juſtification: Here let it be obſerved, That Juſtification is derived from two Words which ſignify to <hi>make Juſt.</hi> Now, he is Juſt, who is free from the Guilt of any Crime (whereby Right is violated) and ſo deſerves not to be puniſhed; and to <hi>make Juſt</hi> or <hi>Righteous,</hi> is either by infuſing Righteouſneſs, as was done to our firſt Parents at their Creation; or by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004824_0004_100DF86DA0DF67C0"/>or declaring to free one from the Puniſhment due for Sin. It is in this laſt Senſe the Word is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally taken in Scripture: It alludes to Perſons ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign'd at a civil Court, who, upon Hearing of their Caſe, are acquitted, by reaſon of another's Diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Debt for them. Juſtification is diametrically oppoſed to Condemnation, and may be ſaid to be three fold, <hi>viz.</hi> In the Sight of GOD, Conſcience, and Man. Juſtification in the Sight of God, may be thus deſcribed, namely, <hi>That it is a Declaration of God's pure Grace, whereby, upon the Account of the Obedience and Sufferings of Chriſt, imputed and received by Faith, he frees Perſons from the Guilt of Sin, and gives them a Right to eternal Salvation.</hi> Juſtification in the Sight of Conſcience, is the Senſe or Knowledge of being juſtified before God; which uſually follows the Exerciſe of a Saving Faith. Hence the Apoſtle obſerves, That <hi>we have not received the Spirit of Bondage again to fear; but the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father.</hi> Juſtification before Man, conſiſts in the ſpiritual Fruits of Faith appearing in our Practice; which evidence to others the Reality of our Juſtification before God. In this Senſe the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> aſſerts a Man to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Works, and deſired thoſe who profeſs'd Faith, to ſhew it by their Works. And thus is the ſeeming Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the two Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James</hi> removed; the former ſpeaks only of Juſtification before God, while the latter ſpeaks of a Juſtification before Man. It may be alſo obſerved, that theſe Apoſtles had to deal with very different Sorts of People, <hi>viz.</hi> ſtrict Phariſees and looſe Libertines; while the former depended upon their ſtrict Obedience for Acceptance with God, the latter depended on a Faith which did not produce Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Now, as it was neceſſary to drive the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> from a carnal Dependance upon Works, that ſo with Poverty of Spirit they might receive and reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Redeemer, ſo it was neceſſary to convince the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004824_0005_100DF86FBB90E2D8"/>Libertines that their Faith was not Juſtifying, becauſe it did not produce good Fruits, that ſo they might be humbled before God, and with Importunity implore his Favour.</p>
            <p>But it is Juſtification before God of which the Text under our preſent Conſideration treats, this therefore the preſent Argument concerns; which is, as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> a gracious Declaration of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God alone is the Author of Juſtification, and that under the Conſideration of a Supream Lord, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, Judge and Creditor, whom by Sin we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, to whom, by Sin, we are become Debtors, and who therefore can only diſſolve our Obligation to Puniſhment. It is he alone, who, in infinite Wiſdom, deviſed the Scene of Salvation for fallen Mankind, which the Goſpel reveals. It is he, who has, in infinite Love, provided a Surety for Sinners, qualified him for this Work, and accepted his Accompliſhment of it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Account. And, it is he, who unites thoſe that are to be juſtified, to the Mediator; as well as imputes his Righteouſneſs to them for their Acceptance. Now, God the Father does not only concur in the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sinner, as has been obſerved; but alſo the Son of God concurs by Satisfying as a Sacrifice, and Interceeding as an Advocate; and likewiſe, the Holy Spirit, by his teſtifying and ſealing Influences.</p>
            <p>JUSTIFICATION, in its Nature, may be called a Declaration of Almighty God, or judicial Pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sentence

            <p>In the mean Time, the aforeſaid Declaration is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely gracious in reſpect of us: It ſprings from the pure unexcited Goodneſs of the bleſſed God; No inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Righteouſneſs in us, or good Work done by us, bears the leaſt Part in our Juſtification; for <hi>we have all ſinned and come ſhort of the Glory of God.</hi> The ſame pure Grace that gave a Redeemer to the World, and calls the Elect to embrace him, pronounces thoſe Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous who are by Faith united to him: For what is our Juſtification but a Blotting out of our Iniquities, a Forgiving and Hiding of our Sins

The Freeneſs of the Divine Goodneſs in his Dealings with Sinners is moſt nobly repreſented by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> where he compares Man in his natural State to a new-born In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant lying in the open Field in its Blood, equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Loathing and to Ruin.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>this,</hi> even <hi>this,</hi> be aſtoniſhed O Heavens! is a Time of <hi>Love,</hi> a Time when the great Lord of the Univerſe ſpreads the Spirit of his condeſcending Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs over us, and ſays to us, <hi>Live.</hi> Bleſſed God, how pure is thy Mercy, and how well worthy of our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Regards! But tho' they be Sinners whom God juſtifies, yet are they elected, redeemed, called, regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and believing Ones.

            </p>
            <p>Here it will be proper to enquire, what that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is for which a Sinner is juſtified before God? Seeing the Judge of all the Earth muſt needs do right, and that his Judgments are juſt and true, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004824_0007_100DF873A3AB39C0"/>follow, that he cannot pronounce thoſe Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous who have no Righteouſneſs at all in any Senſe. And ſeeing that the Perſon to be juſtified is in himſelf ungodly, having no inward Righteouſneſs for which he can be juſtified, it is therefore abſolutely neceſſary that another's Righteouſneſs intervene, for which the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may be pronounc'd Righteous. But the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of no meer Creature can intervene; becauſe every one of them owes it (by Virtue of Creation) as a Debt to God, from whom he has received his Being and all his Benefits.</p>
            <p>The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt therefore alone remains, as the deſerving Cauſe of a Sinner's Juſtification before God: Hence he is ſaid to be made Sin, for us, who knew no Sin (<hi>i. e.</hi> by Imputation) that in like Manner we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him: He is called, <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs;</hi> and by the Righteouſneſs of One, the free Gift is ſaid to come upon all Men (<hi>i. e.</hi> all Believers) unto Juſtification of Life. Him, as the Apoſtle juſtly obſerves, <hi>Hath God ſet forth to be a Propitiation</hi> (or Atonement) <hi>thro' Faith in his Blood.</hi> As by the Unrighteouſneſs of the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> all his natural Offspring are condemned, ſo by the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Second, all his ſpiritual Offspring, <hi>viz.</hi> Believers, are juſtified.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is two-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> eſſential and acquired, of his Nature and Life; it may be queried, which of theſe is imputed to Believers? To this it may be replied, that, albeit, the whole Saviour, and his entire Righteouſneſs, does conduce to our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inaſmuch as he is wholly given of God to the World, that whoſoever believes in him might obtain eternal Salvation; his Birth and Life was not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but for us; hence it's ſaid, that he came not to be miniſtered unto, but to miniſter, and give his Life a Ranſom for many: Nevertheleſs, the eſſential Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, both divine and humane, does not
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004824_0008_100DF8769AF28F40"/>conduce to our Juſtification, <hi>as our Righteouſneſs,</hi> for which we are juſtified; becauſe that that was neceſſary for himſelf: And to ſuppoſe that it is imputed to us, would render the Righteouſneſs of his Life and Death unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It was nevertheleſs neceſſary to qualify the Perſon of the Mediator, to compaſs that Righteouſneſs for which we are juſtified, which is the Righteouſneſs of his Life and Death. This is uſually called his active and paſſive Obedience: The active Obedience of Chriſt is his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect fulfilling the Commands of the Law of God: His paſſive, is his Suffering thoſe Penalties which were threaten'd for our Breaches of it, if not altogether in Kind, yet in Weight. The Precept and Penalty of the Law muſt both be fulfilled, becauſe of God's Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Truth, in order to free us from the Guilt of Sin, and acquire for us a Right to Salvation, which we had forfeited by it. Our Juſtification is to be aſcrib'd to the whole Obedience of Chriſt, both active and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, conſidered complexly or together; becauſe that Satisfying and Meriting don't differ really in this Affair. Does not the Scripture inform us, that <hi>as by one Man's Diſobedience many were made Sinners, ſo by the Obedience of one ſhall many be made Righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Satisfaction of Chriſt was ſufficient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Demands of the Law and Juſtice, violated and incenſed by the Creature's Sin, will appear, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Quality of his Perſon, the Degrees of his Sufferings, and the Perfection of his Obedience.</p>
            <p>The bleſſed Jeſus was not the Son of God meerly by Office, but by Nature: On this Account we are told, that <hi>he reckoned it no Robbery to be equal with God;</hi> and hence he is called the Brightneſs of his Father's Glory. Now the Dignity of his Perſon muſt needs derive an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Value both upon his Sufferings and Obedience, ſeeing they were endured and performed by one who was as really God (in the ſtricteſt Senſe of the Word) as he was truly Man; they muſt of Neceſſity contain in
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004824_0009_100DF87823C44BB8"/>them infinite Worth. Is it not the unniverſal Suffrage of all Nations, that Puniſhments receive their Eſtimate from the Quality of the Perſons ſuffering? Had not our Lord been Man he could not have ſuffered at all; for the Deity is impaſſible: And had he not been God as well as Man, his Sufferings could not have contain'd infinite Value in them, and ſo never have anſwered the infinite demerit of Sin.</p>
            <p>Now, the Sufferings which our Lord endured in his Body and Soul in his Life, and at his Death, were great in degree; this, his Agony and bloody Sweat in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and Out-cry on the Croſs, <hi>viz. Eli, Eli, lama ſabacthani,</hi> ſufficiently confirm. Hence he is ſaid to tread the Wine-Preſs of his Father's Wrath alone: Undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly a Weight of Wrath equal, in Degree, to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Heinouſneſs of all the Sins of the Elect-World, was laid upon the Soul and Body of Chriſt, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than the Divine Nature could ſupport him under. O how affecting is the Narrative which the Evangeliſts give us of the Sufferings of Chriſt in his Body, by Blows, Scourges, Nails, Thorns, and a cruel Spear! And was not his Soul ſorrowful even to Death?</p>
            <p>Had not our Lord, in the Quality of a Surety, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſatisfied the Law in his Death, he could not have obtain'd an Acquittance in his Reſurrection; but inaſmuch as he was releaſed from the Grave, as a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by publick Sentence, and had a triumphant Entry into Heaven, it evidently proves the Sufficiency of his Satisfaction. And the active Obedience of Chriſt, was compleat and ſpotleſs. Hence we are told, that he was holy, harmleſs and undefiled, and that it became him to fulfil all Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>That the Satisfaction of a Surety in the Sinners room ſhould be accepted upon his Account, is wholly owing to the abſolute Sovereignty and meer good Pleaſure of the great God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:004824_0010_100DF87A5D0181B0"/>
Right Reaſon will inform us, that the Almighty, by an Act of Supremacy, might relax the Law as to the Letter of it (which required perfect, perſonal Obedience, upon Pain of Death, to be endured by the Delinquent) and diſpenſe with its Execution upon ſuch Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as might anſwer the Ends of Government. And this, we are aſſured by the ſacred Oracles, the bleſſed God did. Men not being able to obey perfectly, they being themſelves imperfect, and being equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to ſatisfy for their Offences, themſelves being finite; in order to prevent their unavoidable and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Ruin, it pleaſed the eternal Father to appoint a Mediator to interpoſe, by Way of Surety, to authorize and qualify him for this Office, and to declare his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of his Execution of it. Hence we are told, that <hi>Him hath the Father ſealed, and that in him is the Father well pleaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which compleats the Whole, is the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's conſenting to his Father's Propoſals, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſuffer and obey in the Sinners room, and thereby to ſatisfy divine Juſtice for them. The Efficacy of the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's Obedience depends much upon his own volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Engagement; for being the Lord of Heaven there was no ſuperiour Authority to compel him; and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing there were, he being perfectly innocent, it would not accord with Juſtice, to force him to ſuffer for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Crimes: But as the Proverb is, <hi>To a willing Mind there is no Injury done.</hi> Our Lord informs us, that <hi>he had Power to lay down his Life,</hi> and that <hi>he was willing to do it.</hi> He himſelf alſo aſſures us, by ſaying, <hi>Lo I come, in the Volume of thy Book it is written of me: I delight to do thy Will, O my God; yea, thy Law is within my Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however excellent and perfect the Righteouſneſs of the Mediator is, it can be of no avail to us, without an Appropriation. Here therefore it will be neceſſary to enquire how it is made ours? and that is two Ways,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004824_0011_100DF87BEDACCF60"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> by Imputation, and Faith, as was obſerved in the Deſcription; the former is without us, and the latter is within us.</p>
            <p>He that hath no inward or inherent Righteouſneſs of his own, for which he ſhould be juſtified; can be juſtified no other way but by Imputation. However this Term has been ſcoffed at by <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and other Oppoſers of the Doctrines of Grace; yet we find it is a ſcriptural one. It is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he believ'd God, and it was counted to him for Righteouſneſs; and that the Man is bleſſed to whom God will not impute Sin.

            </p>
            <p>Now the aforeſaid Imputation conſiſts in the Father's giving of his Son to us;

            <p>But the inward Mean on Men's Part, of Appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to us, is Faith; not a dead Faith! which is deſtitute of good Works: No, ſuch a hiſtorical, ineffectual Aſſent to Truth, if it be depended upon, will but ſerve to deceive us into Ruin, and aggravate our everlaſting Pains thro' Surprize. The Faith which juſtifies, is a living Principle of good Action, form'd by God's almighty Power in the Soul, by which we are reſolved to have God for our laſt End, and Chriſt for our only Mediator.

                  <hi>Jam.</hi> ii. 18. <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 19. <hi>Job.</hi> i. 11, 12.</note> This operative Faith is only a Mean of our Juſtification, or prerequiſite to it; not any deſerving Cauſe of it, either in Whole or in Part: Therefore our Text aſſerts, that we are juſtified by Faith, not for Faith: Faith, in the Buſineſs of Juſtification, is only an Inſtrument whereby we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and lay hold of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt for our Juſtification. If Faith, conſidered as a Work of the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004824_0012_100DF87EE06DC200"/>Creature, was in any degree a meritorious Cauſe of our Juſtification, then we ſhould be juſtified by Works, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scriptures. That Faith ſhould have any Inſtrumentality in our Juſtification above other Graces, is entirely owing to the moſt free Conſtitution of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God: But in the mean Time, we may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay, that in this Method the Pureneſs of divine Grace ſhines with the greateſt Glory towards poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in that God will juſtify them upon the Account of the Righteouſneſs of his Son, received by Faith alone: And the Wildom of God is alſo diſcover'd in Chooſing this Grace to be the Inſtrument of a Sinner's Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a Prerequiſite before it; becauſe as it inclines to exalting Thoughts of God, ſo it empties a Man of Self, and breaks the Pride of the Heart.</p>
            <p>It was before obſerved, in the Deſcription of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that God thereby frees Perſons from the Guilt of Sin, and gives them a Right to eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>By the Guilt of Sin, an Obligation or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to Puniſhment, by reaſon of the Threatnings of the Law againſt Tranſgreſſors, is intended. There is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to thoſe that are juſtified.
<note n="(i)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 1, 33, 34.</note> It is true, by Juſtification the almighty God does not take away the Stain of Sin; for that is done afterwards by Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Neither are all Effects of Sin together and at once removed. Even juſtified Perſons are excercis'd with various Afflictions, and at laſt endure the Pains of a temporal Death. But theſe are not proper Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted with any view to compenſate the Injury offered by Sin to God. Neither do they proceed from his vindicative Juſtice, or tend to the Hurt of the Perſon afflicted: No, they are Chaſtnings indeed! oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by Sin, but proceeding from the fatherly Love of God; they are made to promote the Good of the Juſtify'd.
<note n="(k)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 28.</note> Now, ſeeing the Guilt of Sin is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004824_0013_100DF88067F26508"/>namely, potential and actual, it is not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that Juſtification removes both: No, potential Guilt is inſeparable from Sin; for it is contradictory to ſuppoſe any thing to be Sin and not at the ſame time to deſerve Puniſhment: It is therefore the latter only which Juſtification aboliſhes, namely, the Sinner's O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation to Puniſhment; and that by transferring it upon the Surety, who in this reſpect was made Sin for us, and therefore bore our Iniquities (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments due for them) on his Body on the Tree.</p>
            <p>Moreover, as the Guilt of Sin involves or includes a certain Captivity to Corruption, a Debt or Subjection to Puniſhment, and an Enmity againſt God;

                  <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 7.</note> ſo that Abſolution, which Juſtification includes, has a threefold Denomination: In reſpect of Bondage it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Redemption, which is the Freeing of a Captive Soldier, by the Payment of a certain Price: In reſpect of Debt and Puniſhment, it is called Remiſſion or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs:

Truely, ſuch have Fellowſhip with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Guilt of Sin being removed, a Right to eternal Life muſt needs ſucceed; which it is beſt to aſcribe to the whole undivided Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> of his active and paſſive Obedience, as the meritorious Cauſe thereof. Inaſmuch as there ſeems to be no real Difference between a Freedom from eternal Death, and a Right to eternal Life, no more than between Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Merit; it therefore ſeems not proper (in our
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004824_0014_100DF882888D21F8"/>Sentiments) to deprive the paſſive Obedience of Chriſt of the Honour of Deſerving, or the Active of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Satisfying.</p>
            <p>Albeit, that Juſtification is an unalterable Sentence of almighty God, that can never be repealed, the Sins of the Juſtify'd will not be remembered to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; for it is God that juſtifieth, who is he therefore that condemneth? Yet it is neceſſary to have the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt repeatedly apply'd to the Soul by frequent Acts of Faith; becauſe of Sins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after the Beginning of our Juſtification, that ſo it may be continued until it is conſummate at the laſt Judgment by that Voice of Chriſt, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Altho' the Perſeverance of the Juſtify'd is bottom'd upon the Promiſe of a faithful God;
<note n="(n)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> xxxii. 40.</note> yet it is ſuch as renders the Uſe of a Means neceſſary. We muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to keep ourſelves in the Love of God: And altho' Works are no meritorious Cauſe of our Juſtification, yet are they neceſſary Means to obtain it from God, who will be enquired of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to do thoſe Things for them which he has even purpoſed to confer.</p>
            <p>But it is time to proceed to the</p>
            <p>SECOND GENERAL HEAD of Diſcourſe, which was to ſhew that Juſtification cannot be attain'd by the Works of the Law. To this end, let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that in order to Juſtification by the Law a Perfection of Obedience is neceſſary; the Law curſes for the leaſt Default in Thought, Word or Action. <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 10.</p>
            <p>Now, this is, at preſent, impoſſible for us to perform; for we have already, in our firſt Parents, ſinned and come ſhort of the Glory of God; and on this Account every Mouth is ſtop'd, and the whole World is become guilty before God: That awful Treſpaſs has robb'd us
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004824_0015_100DF884A5AE0AB8"/>of our original Integrity, Harmony and Beauty, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd into all our Powers a univerſal Depravity, Diſcord and Deformity. How therefore can ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Cauſes produce perfect Effects? This is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in the Nature of Things. But ſuppoſing we could keep the Law of God in time to come; yet how could we make Satisfaction for our paſt Diſobedience? ſeeing that Sin is an Offence committed againſt a Being of infinite Perfections, a Being to whom we are under infinite Obligations, not only by reaſon of his eſſential Excellency, but communicative Kindneſs to us; of all which, Sin is a rebellious and ungrateful Breach; it muſt therefore, in its Nature, deſerve infinite Puniſhment. which God, in Juſtice, is obliged to inflict. But this, contracted into a finite Space, no meer Creature can ſuſtain; it would ſurely deſtroy his Being: Therefore what the Puniſhment wants in Weight nuſt be made up in Continuance; and thus the ſinning Creature will be forever ſuffering, and can never ſatisfy.</p>
            <p>Before Perſons have Faith, the divine Word informs us, that whatever they do is Sin; and as ſoon as they attain Faith, they are united to Chriſt, and ſo muſt needs be juſtified by his Righteouſneſs. Now, is it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to ſuppoſe that what is Sin, at leaſt in the Manner of Performance, ſhould be a meritorious Cauſe of Juſtification?</p>
            <p>To ſuppoſe that we are juſtified by Works, is to ſay that the Reward is not of Grace but of Debt; contrary to the moſt plain and repeated Declarations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that our Juſtification is free and gracious.
<note n="(o)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 20, 24. <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 7, 8.</note> Neither can our Juſtification be partly of Grace, and partly of Works; for thus, as the Apoſtle juſtly obſerves, <hi>Grace would be no more Grace, and Works would be no more Works.</hi> To be juſtified by Grace is to be juſtified freely, without a Reſpect to any Work of the Creature as a deſerving Cauſe thereof: But to be juſtified by
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004824_0016_100DF886C76B3350"/>Works, in any degree reſpects them as a deſerving Cauſe. Now, here is an unreconcilable Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. It is the ſame Thing ſubſtantially in the Caſe before us, whether Merit is ſuppoſed to conſiſt in the Worth of the Work done, or in a Promiſe of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, pretended to be annexed to the Endeavours of natural Men: Which the Papiſts diſtinguiſh by the Terms of Congruity and Condignity; for both Ways God is bound, by the Labours of his Enemies to give them Happineſs. Whatever Probability of obtaining does attend the Endeavours of natural Men, there is no certainty, otherwiſe Juſtification would be by the Works of the Law; and indeed, we may as eaſily reconcile Light and Darkneſs, Fire and Water, Life and Death, as Juſtification partly by Works, and partly by Grace; for Grace muſt loſe its Nature, if it be by Works with it, and Works muſt loſe their Nature, if it be by Grace together with them.</p>
            <p>Beſides, to ſuppoſe that the Works of the Creature are join'd with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, as deſerving Cauſes of Juſtification, reflects great Diſhonour upon his Satisfaction; for it plainly intimates that it is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat: If it is compleat, as the Teſtimony of the Father declares, by ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> then there is no Need of the Creature's Additions: If it be incompleat, then how can an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Creature accompliſh that which God himſelf is ſuppoſed to have left unfiniſhed. Undoubtedly, there is ſtill a Neceſſity of Obedience to the moral Law, as it is an invariable Rule of Righteouſneſs correſponding to the divine Perfections, in order to teſtify our Regard to God's commanding Authority, and our Gratitude for his Love to us, as well as to teſtify the Truth of our Faith in him: But by no means is our Obedience to be admitted as a meritorious Cauſe of our Acceptance with God; for in that reſpect Chriſt has become the End of the Law to every one that believeth; as <hi>Bernard,</hi> of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004824_0017_100DF8884FB13A28"/>old, obſerved, <hi>Tho' Works be the Way to the Kingdom, yet they are not the Cauſe of our Reigning there.</hi> Surely we ſhould expect Juſtification only in that Way in which <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the Faithful, obtain'd it; but that was not by Works, but by Faith. If <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, were juſtified by Works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scripture aſſerts, that we are juſtified in that Way, which excludes all Boaſting; but by what Law is it excluded; is it by the Law of Works? nay, but by the Law of Faith. If Man contributed any thing towards his Juſtification, he would have whereof to glory, but this no Man hath; hence we are told that God juſtifieth the Ungodly, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as have no Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of their own to commend them to his Favour; and that he imputeth Righteouſneſs without Works.</p>
            <p>If they which are of the Law be Heirs, <hi>i. e.</hi> if Men by Obedience to the Law can procure an Intereſt in the heavenly Inheritance, then is Faith made void, and the Promiſe made of none Effect: There is no need of Believing in Jeſus for that which we have in ourſelves; nor any need of his Attonement, ſeeing that the Matter can be otherwiſe adjuſted, according to this Notion; and if ſo the very Foundation of the Goſpel is overthrown; for what need is there of a Saviour to do that for us which we can do for ourſelves.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> on the Contrary informs us, That Iſrael, <hi>who ſought after Righteouſneſs, did not obtain it; becauſe they ſought it, as it were, by the Works of the Law; and that being ignorant of God, and going about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, they did not ſubmit themſelves to the Righteouſneſs of God:</hi> But of himſelf he ſays, That <hi>he deſired not to be found in that Righteouſneſs which is of the Law; but that which is thro' the Faith of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, ſeeing Juſtification by Works is of impoſſible Attainment, and there being no other Way of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation open'd but by Faith, it muſt therefore of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004824_0018_100DF88A6EBCE3B8"/>be by Faith; and this, indeed is frequently and and roundly aſſerted in the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is ſuch alone as can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Sinner's Debts, and procure for him an heavenly Inheritance; and in this Way of Acceptance God is moſt glorified, and Man moſt humbled.</p>
            <p>Neither does this Scheme of Free-Juſtification, open a Door to Licentiouſneſs, as ſome have imagined; but on the Contrary, it ſecures Obedience upon the beſt Foundation, inaſmuch as that Faith, which juſtifies, is a living, laſting Principle of holy and humble Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the more free and rich the Love of God is to us the more it muſt needs excite our Love to him: For Love is Love's-Load ſtone; and muſt not every one confeſs that Love is the only Principle of evangelical and acceptable Obedience; and that in Proportion to the Strength of the Cauſe, will be the Effects produced by it. That Obedience, which principally ſprings from a meaner Source, <hi>viz.</hi> ſlaviſh dread of the divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, or hireling Notions of thereby purchaſing Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, however fair Appearances it may have in the Eye of Man, is fleſhly and dead; and therefore abhor'd by that God who is a Spirit. The Apoſtle therefore, juſtly rejected the aforeſaid Cavil with Deteſtation, <hi>Shall we continue in Sin that Grace may abound? God forbid,</hi> ſay'd he: <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to Sin, live any longer therein?</hi> And elſewhere, <hi>do we make void the Law by Faith? Yea</hi> (ſays he) <hi>we eſtabliſh the Law:</hi> Namely, by providing a Righteouſneſs which fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers its Demands, and by exciting Obedience to its Precepts from the nobleſt Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> Love.</p>
            <p>If it be oppoſed, to what has been before obſerved, that we can no more be righteous, becauſe of another's Righteouſneſs, than we can be wiſe or learn'd, becauſe of another's Wiſdom or Learning; it may be reply'd, that the Objection will hold ſo far as it concerns an
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004824_0019_100DF88CECC5EA00"/>eſſential or inherent Righteouſneſs, which cannot, by Imputation, be ſo made another's, that thro' That he he ſhould be reckon'd inherently Righteous; neither do we affirm any ſuch Thing relating to Juſtification. Beſides, there is alſo a Difference in this, that one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be united with another, ſo as Believers are with Chriſt, as Members with the Head. By the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt being imputed to us, we underſtand no more, than that his Merit and Satisfaction is ſo far reckoned to us as that we are thereby freed from the Guilt of Sin, and obtain a Right to Salvation.</p>
            <p>But it is time to proceed to the IMPROVEMENT of this noble and important Subject: And here let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider a little of that Honour that is hereby reflected upon the divine Atributes. With what ſurprizing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival'd Glory does the unſearchable Wiſdom of <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> ſhine, in Deviſing and Concerting a Method, which at the ſame time eſtabliſhes his inviolable Truth, engaged to iſſue the Threats of the broken Covenant, ſatisfies his awful and inflexible Juſtice, wrong'd by the Creature's Sin, thro' an almighty Surety's Sufferings in their Room and Stead; ſecures the End of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by Honouring the Law more than it ever was before, thro' the ſpotleſs Obedience of one who was God, as well as Man, in the Guilty Sinner's Place: And yet opens a Door for the Manifeſtation of the pureſt and richeſt Grace upon unworthy and condemned Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, in their Acceptance and Salvation! while fallen Angels, a nobler Order of Creatures, are wholly paſſed by, and no Offer of Mercy made to them! What Man, what Angel, can ſufficiently declare the Depth, the Glory of divine Wiſdom, which has taken occaſion by the Creature's Sin, which is the vileſt Evil, to bring the greateſt Glory to himſelf, and the greateſt Good to Mankind? O! with what Majeſty and Sweetneſs, does the Harmony of divine Perfections ſparkle forth in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004824_0020_100DF88F9ED7D7F0"/>of Man by Jeſus Chriſt? And, O! how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazingly is their Salvation hereby ſecured upon a more unſhaken Foundation than while Man remained in a State of Innocency; for now is their Stock in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator's Hands. O! let us dwell upon the Thoughts of theſe Things 'til our Hearts be fir'd with Love and Gratitude.</p>
            <p>But how can we expreſs Gratitude without Searching the Foundations of our Hope; ſeeing that all our Peace and Conſolation in Adverſity, depends upon the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of our Juſtification? It muſt needs be a Duty of the laſt Neceſſity for us to enquire into our preſent State: Which that we may do to ſome Purpoſe, Faith, which is the Inſtrument of our Juſtification, ſhould be impartially examined. Now, thoſe that have true Faith, have been, according to the Promiſe of our Saviour, convinced of their Unbelief, <hi>i. e.</hi> of their total Want of Faith, their Inability to believe, their utter Unworthineſs of the Gift of Faith; as well as of the Rebellion and Ingratitude, that is graſp'd in Unbelief, and of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Miſeries conſequent thereupon. And ſeeing Faith is a Receiving of Chriſt, in all his Offices, upon Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Terms, <hi>Joh.</hi> i. 12. Therefore, thoſe that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, have been made ſenſible of their Need of Chriſt in all his Offices: They have groan'd under the Burden of their Ignorance, Guilt and Slavery, and have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced a Vertue flowing from the ſeveral Offices of Chriſt to the Healing of the aforeſaid Diſeaſes. And indeed, every Believer feels a daily Need of Chriſt, in all his Offices; he daily lives upon Chriſt, and to him, and no more to himſelf; he comes out of the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this World leaning upon his <hi>Beloved;</hi> for to him to live is Chriſt. Chriſt is the principal Support and higheſt End of the Believer's Life; as the Glory of Chriſt is the higheſt Mark of all the different Kinds of his Action (in general) ſo the Love of Chriſt, as a Principle, conſtrains him to act; and under a Senſe of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004824_0021_100DF89127D2AFD8"/>his own Folly and Weakneſs, by the Exerciſe of Faith, he deſires Strength from Chriſt, as the Head of Influence, to ſerve God ſpiritually, not in the Oldneſs of the Letter, but in the Newneſs of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Again, as the vital Act of Faith conſiſts in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Will to Goſpel Terms; therefore, thoſe that believe to Juſtification, muſt needs know, and have ſeriouſly conſidered them, as well as without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and with Reſolution comply'd with them. Hence, we may ſafely aſſert, that ſuch who know not, in ſome Meaſure, by Experience, what it is to deny their natural, civil, ſinful and religious Self, are Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: For, not only Sin, is to be deny'd or forſaken abſolutely and immediately; but even the other Kinds of Self, in ſome Reſpects: And thoſe alſo who take not up the Croſs of Chriſt, and follow him, do not believe in him with a juſtifying Faith.</p>
            <p>It may be here obſerv'd, that as the Perſon (mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Goſpel) in his Coming to Chriſt, was thrown down and torn by the Devil; ſo it is common for thoſe, that believe to Juſtification, to be oppoſed and tempted by the Devil in Believing. Juſtifying Faith does alſo produce powerful Effects; as it makes Chriſt precious to the Soul, ſo it humbles the Sinner's Heart, and makes him think, with <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>He is leſs than the leaſt of all Saints:</hi> It gives Victory over the World (<hi>viz.</hi> the Luſts of it) and works by Love to God and Man. What is ſaid of Hope may be juſtly apply'd to Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> that it purifies the Heart, <hi>i. e.</hi> makes Perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous after, and labouring for Heart-Purity, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them to enter into a Courſe of War againſt the Contrary.</p>
            <p>Such as have a juſtifying Faith, muſt needs have been brought to a Heart-affecting Complaiſance with the Goſpel Scheme of Salvation by Grace: This Way they deſire to be ſaved, and no other. <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:004824_0022_100DF892B0581558"/>
And ſeeing that Faith is the Bond of Union to Chriſt, it muſt needs affect Believers with a high Regard to his Honour and Kingdom. Every Believer therefore has a a ſingle Eye to the Glory of God in the Courſe of his Actions. O how much depends upon this! If our Eye be ſingle, our whole Body is full of Light; if not, it is full of Darkneſs. O! if you think that this is of eaſy Attainment, and that you have always had it, you are ſurely ignorant of God and yourſelves! For no natural Man on Earth hath, or while he ſo remains, can have a ſingle Eye: A Fountain can't ſend forth Streams above a Level with itſelf.</p>
            <p>If you have a juſtifying Faith, <hi>my dear Brethren,</hi> ye ſurely have a tender Regard to the Church of God; as a Member of the natural Body, that is united by a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Band to the Whole, muſt be ſenſibly touch'd with the Pains and Pleaſures of any Part thereof. Thus it is with you, if ye believe. When God's Name is prophan'd, and his Kingdom is not promoted, ye mourn; but when God is glorified, and Sinners are convinced and converted, ye rejoice.</p>
            <p>Again, ſuch as are juſtified, are effectually called, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 30. The Voice of Chriſt is accompanied with ſupernatural Light and irreſiſtible Power upon their Minds and Hearts, which baniſh their natural Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Rebellion and Prejudice, and make them ſtoop to the Saviour's Scepter. He that commanded the Light to ſhine at firſt out of Darkneſs, gives them the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Chriſt. God ſends the Rod of his Strength out of <hi>Zion,</hi> and makes his People a willing People in the Day of his Power.</p>
            <p>And thoſe that are juſtified do confeſs their Sins with deep Humiliation, Shame and Sorrow; as the <hi>Publican,</hi> who ſtood afar off, and ſmote upon his Breaſt, and ſaid, <hi>God be merciful to me a Sinner.</hi> This Man went to his Houſe juſtify'd, when the proud <hi>Phariſee</hi> was rejected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:004824_0023_100DF8944CAB4D28"/>
But the juſtified Perſon does not only confeſs Sin, but forſake it in his Heart, and Practice: For there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable Conection between Juſtification and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 11. As Juſtification includes in it Reconciliation to God; this, in the Order of Nature, as well as of God, neceſſarily ſuppoſes our being ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully ſenſible of our natural Enmity againſt him; and therefore ſuch as have not been made ſenſible of the latter, may aſſure themſelves that they are unacquainted with the former, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 20.</p>
            <p>And thoſe that are reconcil'd to God himſelf, muſt needs be reconcil'd to his People, his Laws and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences.</p>
            <p>By theſe Things, <hi>my dear Friends,</hi> we ſhould exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ourſelves, and ſee whether we be juſtified or not.</p>
            <p>As to thoſe who have experienced the aforeſaid Signs of Juſtification, ye are bleſſed indeed! <hi>Pſa.</hi> xxxi. 1. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man whoſe Iniquity is forgiven, and whoſe Sin is covered:</hi> For ye have Peace with God, and Peace with Conſcience; that Peace which paſſes all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; that Peace which Chriſt left as a Legacy to his Diſciples, <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 1. And ſuch have free Acceſs, with a humble Boldneſs, to a gracious God in all their Straits, who is both willing and able to relieve them, <hi>Eph.</hi> iii. 12. And, O how noble! how ſweet! how precious! and how important, is thy Privilege! Who can expreſs it? Such ſhall perſevere in the Grace of God, and be carry'd by his mighty Power thro' Faith unto Salvation. The Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt them, nor Death or Life ſeparate them from the Love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus. Such may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the Hope of the Glory of God, and triumph in all Adverſity; ſeeing every Affliction they meet with ſprings from a Father's Love, and ſhall ſurely, by his Direction, promote their Good; eſpecially conſidering that under Affliction the Love of God is more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhed abroad in their Hearts. Such are by the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004824_0024_100DEE8FE65AC190"/>of Chriſt freed from the Guilt of Sin, the Wrath of God, and eternal Condemnation. O what ſweet Conſolation ſprings from the Doctrine of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to every pious Soul in every Diſtreſs! whether it be Trouble of Conſcience about the Multitude and Heinouſneſs of their Sins, or Fears of Death, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Hell, or worldly Calamities and unjuſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. What can more effectually ſupport the Soul than to think that it is God who juſtifieth, againſt whom neither the Accuſations of Satan and of the World; nay, nor of our own Conſciences, can in the leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. As alſo, that God does not juſtify the Righteous, but Sinners; and that of the deepeſt Dye, <hi>namely,</hi> the Ungodly and Rebellious, from pure Grace; whereby he imputes the Righteouſneſs of his only begotten Son to them; and thereby, upon their Believing in him, frees them from the Guilt of all their Offences, how many and great ſoever they be, and entitules them to eternal Glory. Hence he is ſaid, not to behold Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>Jacob,</hi> or Perverſneſs in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the Contrary, how miſerable is the Caſe of all unjuſtify'd Perſons! <hi>namely,</hi> ſuch who want the Signs of Faith and Juſtification, before deſcribed: Such who profeſs Chriſt in Words, but in Works deny him: Such who have only a dead Faith without Works: Such who are Strangers to the Power of experimental Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Communion with God, and Conformity to him.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the Unjuſtify'd in Life, their Perſons are cover'd with the baſeſt Deformity; their Bodies are Inſtruments of Unrighteouſneſs to Sin; and their Minds and Conſciences are defil'd.</p>
            <p>In reſpect of their worldly Goods, they are Uſurpers; Man having by his Fall loſt his original Right to the Creatures, it can be only recover'd by an Intereſt in Chriſt, thro' Faith; who is made, by his Father, Heir of all Things. Now, inaſmuch as they want this, they
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004824_0025_100DF8996B7EE728"/>are Uſurpers in the Sight of God, whatever civil Claim they may have notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>In regard to their Pleaſures and Proſperity, it is juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, that their Table is a Snare and a Trap to their Souls, and that the Proſperity of Fools deſtroys them; they ſtand on ſlippery Places, and are but the more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for an aggravated Ruin by all their proſperous Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes; even their very Bleſſings are accurſed, as the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> expreſſes it.</p>
            <p>Their honourable Exaltations ſerve but to ſink them lower at laſt in the Dungeon of Devils.</p>
            <p>Their Afflictions are dreadful Preſages of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, unavoidable and eternal Miſeries.</p>
            <p>And, O! how dreadful is the Caſe of the Unjuſtify'd at Death (eſpecially if awakened to a Senſe of Danger) when they muſt turn their Backs forever upon all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Enjoyments, face Death with all its grizly Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, feel its invenom'd Sting, and launch the eternal Deep; and in the mean time have no Grain of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, or Glimpſe of Hope; to uſe the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s Words, <hi>How are they brought into Deſtruction, as in a Moment, they are utterly conſumed with Terrors!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if in our Mediation we follow the Unjuſtify'd farther, we may behold their increaſing Miſeries: With what Confuſion ſhall they ſtand before the Bar of the great God at the general Judgment! while every of their Sins are expoſed in all their awful Aggravations, and they have none to plead their Cauſe. What Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, Indignation and Pain muſt tear their guilty Souls, when they hear the great Judge pronounce their final Sentence, <hi>Go, ye accurſed, into everlaſting Burnings, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Devil and his Angels:</hi> And, behold him laughing at their Calamities.</p>
            <p>But if we view their eternal State, alas! how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and how ſhocking is the Sight! For in that Priſon where they are irrecoverably fixed; there their Worm does not die, and the Fire is unquenchable, and they
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004824_0026_100DF89B1B807760"/>ſhall be an Abhorring to all Fleſh, <hi>Iſa.</hi> lxvi. 24. How ſhall Horror for paſt Sins, and loſt Mercies, with Fears of future Miſeries, and utter Deſpair of Relief from them, together with the Vials of divine Vengeance, everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly rack damned Souls!</p>
            <p>Now, ſeeing the Miſeries of the Unjuſtify'd are ſo great, then let Sinners be entreated to beware of abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the precious Doctrine of Juſtification to their own Ruin, by vainly imagining themſelves to be Poſſeſſors of it, when they are far from it. Thoſe who juſtify themſelves when God condemns them, are an Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to him; they deceive themſelves, and obſtruct the Way to their Juſtification and Salvation, <hi>Prov.</hi> xvii. 15. <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 3. <hi>Mat.</hi> xiii. This thoſe do, who depend upon Church-Privileges, a dead Faith, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenanted Mercy of God, the Death of Chriſt unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to the Soul, or their own Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>It is infinitely better for you, <hi>my Friends,</hi> to know and own the worſt of your Caſe, and to ſeek after Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thro' Chriſt with the utmoſt Vehemence, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your own Righteouſneſs (for he that is proud of his own, will not prize, ſeek or obtain another) by deep Humiliation for your many and heinous Offences, in the Language of the penitent <hi>Publican,</hi> by ſeeking the Knowledge of Chriſt crucify'd, and Help from God to receive him by a living Faith.</p>
            <p>And the Saints of God ſhould be careful that they abuſe not the aforeſaid Doctrine to Sloth and ſinful Indulgence in their cold Frames; for as this is very Grieving to the Spirit of God, and blots our Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences for Heaven; ſo it manifeſts the vileſt Ingratitude, and miniſters an Occaſion of Reflection to the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of the Doctrines of Grace.</p>
            <p>The People of God ſhould alſo beware of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themſelves when God juſtifies them; ſeeing that the Father hath lay'd upon Chriſt the Iniquities of us all, why ſhould we as ungratefully as fooliſhly lay them
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004824_0027_100DF89D6CD762A8"/>upon ourſelves? and ſo act the Adverſary's Part againſt our own Intereſt. We ought not to caſt away our Hope becauſe we have not had ſuch deep Convictions, ſuch great Temptations, and Conſolations as ſome others; or becauſe we have not arrived to the like Degrees of Goodneſs; rather let us deal with Chriſt as <hi>Aaron,</hi> of old, did with the live Goat, who lay'd both his Hands upon him and confeſs'd the Iniquities of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> over him, <hi>Lev.</hi> xvi. 21. After which he is ſaid to bear their Iniquities into a Land not inhabited. Let us caſt the whole Weight of our Souls and our Sins upon Chriſt, by Believing, and then we need not fear Condemnation.</p>
            <p>But in the mean Time the Freeneſs of Juſtification, the Honours and Happineſs of that Condition into which the rebellious, mean and miſerable Sinner is thereby introduced, ſhould excite the utmoſt Gratitude to the Author of ſo great and durable a Benefit; the Senſe of the Worth of this Mercy ſhould be ever in our Minds, and the Perfections of its Author perpetually celebrated with our Lips; while in the mean time in our Lives we glorify God by all holy Obedience. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God has juſtify'd us freely, without good Works, we ſhould expreſs our Thankfulneſs to him, by a more chearful, ſincere and ſteady Practice of them; to which let the Love of God conſtrain us.</p>
            <p>And particularly, let juſtify'd Perſons obey their Lords command, in ſitting down at his Table, and Commemorating his dying Love. Here! ye Friends of God! you may ſee, as in a Glaſs, what the Purchaſe of your Pardon coſt your deareſt Lord. At this Ban<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quet you may behold the dreadful Agonies of his Soul, and Sufferings of his Body for your Sins; which ſhould ſtir up in us, <hi>my dear Brethren,</hi> the ſtrongeſt Affection. O methinks! the holy Jeſus looks exceedingly lovely as he comes with died Garments from <hi>Bozzra</hi> and <hi>Edom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:004824_0028_100DF8A0251729B8"/>
O Sirs! it is the Exerciſe of a juſtifying Faith, which as an Eye, can only help us to behold our Lord's Sufferings in a right Manner; and, as a Conduit, can convey to us the Benefits of them. Which may it pleaſe the good God to give us all for Chriſt's ſake. <hi>Amen.</hi>
