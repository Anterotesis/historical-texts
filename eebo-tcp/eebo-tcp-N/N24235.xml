            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>YE ſons of Hibernia, who ſnug on dry land,</l>
                  <l>Round your ſmoaking turf fires and whiſkey in hand,</l>
                  <l>Drink kid-milk full rough, and ne'er think on the boys,</l>
                  <l>Who are fighting your battles thro' tempeſt and noiſe,</l>
                  <l>Attend to my ditty 'tis true I declare,</l>
                  <l>Such ſwimming and ſinking would make you all ſtare</l>
                  <l>For ſtorms, ſquibs and crackers have ſing'd at my tail</l>
                  <l>Since the preſs-gang laid hold of poor Patrick O'Neal.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>'Twas the firſt of April, I ſet off, like a fool,</l>
                  <l>From Kilkenny to Dublin to ſee Laurence Tool,</l>
                  <l>My mother's third couſin, who oft' had wrote down,</l>
                  <l>And begg'd I'd come ſee how he flouriſh'd in town,</l>
                  <l>But I ſcarce had ſet foot in this terrible place,</l>
                  <l>'Ere I met with a ſharper who ſwore to my face,</l>
                  <l>He beckon'd a preſs-gang, that came without fail,</l>
                  <l>And neck and heels dragg'd off poor Patrick O'Neal.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Then they ſcampered away as they ſaid with a prize</l>
                  <l>(For they thought me a ſailor and off in diſguiſe).</l>
                  <l>But a terrible blunder they made with their ſtrife,</l>
                  <l>For I'd ne'er ſeen a ſhip or the ſea in my life:</l>
                  <l>Away to a tender they told me to ſteer,</l>
                  <l>But of tenderneſs devil a morſel was there:</l>
                  <l>O I roar'd and I curſt, tho' it did not avail,</l>
                  <l>They down in the cellar cram'd Patrick O'Neal.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>We ſet ſail from Dublin the very next day,</l>
                  <l>I was half ſtarved and ſea-ſick the reſt of the way;</l>
                  <l>Not a mile-ſtone I ſaw, nor a houſe, nor a bed,</l>
                  <l>'Twas all water and ſky 'till we came to Spithead:</l>
                  <l>Then they called up all hands—hands and feet ſoon obey'd,</l>
                  <l>O I wiſh'd myſelf home cutting turf with a ſpade,</l>
                  <l>For the firſt thing I faw made my courage to fail,</l>

                  <l>They put out the boat and told me to keep</l>

                  <l>And ſo large were the ſheets that hung up to dry:</l>
                  <l>I thought it Noah's Ark ſtuff d full of queer gueſts,</l>
                  <l>Hogs, pedlers, geeſe, ſailors, and all other beaſts;</l>
                  <l>Some drank bladders of gin, others pitchers of ale,</l>
                  <l>And they ſung, curſt and laugh'd at poor Patrick O'Neal.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>All confounded with bother they began to look queer,</l>
                  <l>When the boatſwain's ſhrill pipe made all hands to appear,</l>
                  <l>Up the ropes like to monkeys they running did ſwear</l>
                  <l>Then like gibbets and rope-dancers ſwung in the air,</l>
                  <l>They clap'd ſticks in her capſtern, (as I afterwards found)</l>
                  <l>The chap ſit and fif'd as they turned it round,</l>
                  <l>The ſhip run her anchor, ſpread her wings and ſet fail,</l>
                  <l>with a freight of live lumber and Patrick O'Neal.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Then to go down below I expreſs'd a great wiſh,</l>
                  <l>Where they live under water like ſo many fiſh;</l>
                  <l>I was put in a meſs with ſome more of the crew;</l>
                  <l>And it being banjon-day they gave me burgue;</l>
                  <l>For a bed they'd a ſack hung as high as my chin,</l>
                  <l>They call'd it a hammock and bade me get in;</l>
                  <l>I lay hold, took a leap, but my footing being frail,</l>
                  <l>It ſwang me clean over!—poor Patrick O'Neal.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>With ſome help I got in, where I rocked all night,</l>
                  <l>The day broke my reſt in a terrible fright,</l>
                  <l>Up hammocks, down cheſts, was cry'd from all parts</l>
                  <l>'There's a French ſhip in ſight,' up and down went my heart:</l>

To a gun I was ſtationed, they cryed with an oath,</l>
                  <l>To pull off his breeches, unmuzzle his mouth,</l>
                  <l>They took off the apron that covered his tail,</l>
                  <l>And the leading-ſtrings gave unto Patrick O'Neal.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Our thick window ſhutters we pulled up with ſpeed</l>
                  <l>And we run out our bull dogs of true Engliſh breed,</l>
                  <l>The captain cried 'England and Ireland my boys!'</l>
                  <l>When he mentioned old Ireland my heart made a noiſe;</l>
                  <l>Our ſweet little guns did the Frenchmen defy,</l>
                  <l>We clap'd fire on his back and bid him let fly,</l>
                  <l>His voice made me leap, tho' I'd hold by his tail,</l>
                  <l>The beaſt then flew back and threw Patrick O'Neal.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Then we leather'd away, by my ſoul, hob and nob,</l>
                  <l>'Till the Frenchmen gave up what they thought a bad job,</l>
                  <l>Then to tye him behind a long cord they did bring,</l>
                  <l>And we led him along like a pig in a ſtring:</l>
                  <l>So home to old England we led the French boy,</l>
                  <l>O the ſight of the land made me ſea-ſick with joy,</l>
                  <l>They made a new peace when the war was too ſtale,</l>

                  <l>Or care how the world went on ſhore;</l>
                  <l>So I packed up the triffling remains I had got,</l>
                  <l>A trifflle alas was my ſtore:</l>

                  <l>Which over my ſhoulder I threw;</l>
                  <l>Away then I trudged with a heart rather ſad,</l>
                  <l>To join in ſome jolly ſhip's crew.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>The ſeas were leſs troubled by far than my mind,</l>
                  <l>When o'er the wide main I ſurvey'd;</l>
                  <l>I could not but think that the world was unkind,</l>
                  <l>And fortune a ſlippery jade:</l>
                  <l>I vow'd if once more I could get her in tow,</l>
                  <l>I would let the ungrateful ones ſee;</l>
                  <l>That the turbulent winds and the billows could ſhow</l>
                  <l>More kindneſs than they did to me.</l>
