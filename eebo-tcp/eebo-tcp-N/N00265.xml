            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

notwithstanding the reproaches cast upon him, &amp; untruths rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed &amp; reported of this Thing, stil appear to justifie &amp; promote the same, and encourage those who are satisfied thereof, and join with him in this his undertaking. The rise of which was as followeth.</p>
            <p>About the latter end of the year 1649. an intimate Friend of the Author's in <hi>London, Mr. William Potter,</hi> who was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise no Trader, Imparted to him a Designe for the accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Commerce, in the nature of a <hi>Bank</hi> of <hi>money</hi>; but to be founded upon <hi>personal Credit</hi>; by a considerable number of able Men Ingaging, as the <hi>Found</hi> thereof, to pass forth Credit; as a medium to enlarge the <hi>Measure</hi> of <hi>money,</hi> that was known to be too little for the Dealings of that Land: Or by <hi>depositing of Goods,</hi> in the nature of a <hi>Lumber</hi> of Merchandise, to pass out Credit thereon, untill sold. As for a <hi>Fund</hi> to have <hi>Land</hi> (the onely secure Deposit) the dubious &amp; intricat Titles thereof, put a stop to any discourse thereabout. And as for a <hi>Bank of money,</hi> there was in that no certain Security; wofull experience proving them subject to a rupture.</p>
            <p>The Author so resented the Notion of his Friend, (the thing being rational, &amp; tending much to the benefit of all men where set on foot) that it became oft times when they met, the common subject of their discourse, in a rotation of Proposals, Objections, and Solutions: Leaving no stone unturn'd, that might fit the designe to comport with that Place. <hi>Mr. Potter</hi> likewise had about that time printed a Book <hi>in folio,</hi> relating to his designe; one whereof he bestowed on the Author, who (upon the report that was given him of the Labyrinth <hi>New-England</hi> was in, for want of a <hi>Conveniency to mete their Trade with</hi>) gave it with good acceptance, to a Kinsman of his that was a Merchant of this Place; the prosperity whereof he was <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 span">

               </gap> to, when not likely ever to see It. Whether by <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Book, or other accident, any motion thereabout <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> unknown. But before any thing was brought to <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> seems there was; an accompt of which shall in
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000337_0003_0FA4AB41FA651CA8"/>
its place be given) the Author was called to <hi>Ireland</hi>; where he had more endeavoured the promotion of this thing, than bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hint it; had not his transient Employ prevented.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In anno</hi> 1664. His lot being here cast, he soon saw that with his eye, that did affect his heart <hi>i. e.</hi> The <hi>Straits</hi> many were in; the <hi>Time</hi> they consumed, and the <hi>Disadvantages</hi> they were under, by higling to suit ends: And thereupon imparted to a publick-spirited Merchant, with what ease, &amp; safety their <hi>Measure</hi> might be inlarged: Who likewise being sensible of the need thereof, desired to have in Writing somewhat about the same. Which being done, It was, it seems, imparted to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, with approbation; and Return made, That somewhat might be done about it in due season: which the author rested satisfied with; in that there lay not now at his dore, a Thing concealed, that might tend to the welfare of the Country.</p>
            <p>About three years after this (that foregoing being wholly buried) the author accidentally started this Expedient, among divers Country Gentlemen, Yeomen &amp; others; persons not likely to lend an ear to a thing of this nature. Yet so it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that to some one, or more of them, the Notion was of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation: and spread abroad, to the occasioning of several De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates among those who were Considerable, both in <hi>Parts &amp; Purse</hi>: And stopped not, untill the honoured Council heard thereof. But before they took notice of it, One of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates Imparted the Designe to an experienced Merchant, well Read in the nature of <hi>Banks,</hi> To have his judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this. Who Returned, that this <hi>Bank</hi> was so Stated, as left not room for a rational Objection to be made against it In that those Founded on <hi>Money,</hi> had only their defect, of a possibility to <hi>break</hi>; which this, Fixed on <hi>Land,</hi> was not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of. Soon after this, the Author had notice given, that the Council would send speedily for him, about this Concern: &amp; was advised to write somewhat about it, for them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he set upon drawing a second Draught, in the dress of a <hi>Proposal.</hi> The which, before quite writ out, a Messenger was
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000337_0004_0FA4AB42E5F0A198"/>
sent to call him to them. To whom he presented his (then crude) conceptions, as follows. To which some clauses, and explanations are added: but is the same for substance, with that on <hi>File</hi> in the Records of the General Court.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Proposal for erecting a FUND of</hi> Land; <hi>by Authority, or private Persons, in the nature of a</hi> Money-Bank; <hi>or</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise-Lumber, <hi>to pass Credit upon, by</hi> Book-Entries; <hi>or</hi> Bils of Exchange, <hi>for great Payments: and</hi> Change-bills <hi>for runi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ng Cash. Wherein is demonstrated, First, the necessity of having a</hi> Bank, <hi>to inlarge the</hi> Measure <hi>of Dealings in this Land, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the benefit of</hi> Money, <hi>if enough to mete Trade with; &amp; the disadvantages, when it is otherwise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Money is that <hi>One thing,</hi> which, as the <hi>medium</hi> of Trade, (for so <hi>Solomon's</hi> Assertion must necessarily, be understood) <hi>answereth All things.</hi> For where it is in plenty, no <hi>Buyer</hi> will be bound to one Person, or Market; nor purchase Credit at the Grantor's price; nor be necessitated to become Servant to the Lender, if he have Money to answer his occasions; nor will run the hazard of Trusting. Hereby also, the frequent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints that are made, for want of present pay, are silenced &amp; persons freed from a multitude of carking cares. It likewise, multiplies Trading; increaseth Manufacture, and Provisions; for domestic use, and foreign Returns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> abateth Interest; inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the purchasing of Land, and heighteneth its value; torwards the Improvement both of real, and personal Estates; promoteth the Settleing of new Plantations, and maritim Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; incourageth heartless Idlers, to Work; redeemeth Time Labour, and Expence, greatly consumed in higling up and down, to suit Pay to content, abrogateth the mystery of Trucking, by sinking Barter, and reducing all bought, and sold, to the English Standard; hindreth wrangling and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xatious Suits upon Debts contracted for want thereof, to the Scandal of a religious people, as well as the impoverishing of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000337_0005_0FA4AB4386B85E10"/>
them, and the consuming the time of their Magistrates, that might be better spent about studying the necessary advantages of Trade, and forwarding of Manufacture, to the inriching of them. To which end most civilized Nations set some apart to manage, and is the Loadstone that draweth <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ommodities to the Market, that great conveniency of a people.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, where <hi>Coin</hi> is scarce, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>This Clause, with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Objections &amp; Queries, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lately made; shall receiv a full Reply in the next Sheet: if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</hi>
               </note> all things are <hi>dear,</hi> &amp; little answereth to content, or free from trouble, and loss. Debts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted; dilatory, and shuffeling pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made; dexterous Traders retire or (which is worse) deal in Money, the <hi>medium</hi> of Trade; young beginners are checked; good men laid open to tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and opportunities given to bad ones, that exact from those who must crave Credit, or cannot make suitable pay. Trade is stinted at home, and forestalled abroad; Stocks lye dead; Intrigue accompts, and perplexing Suits made; Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and Shop-keepers, undersell one another; and piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully help themselves, by beating down Craftsmen: who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, through necessity, underwork others of their occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or slight over their work; adulterate Manufacture, and hasten poverty on all. Nor can ever Trade be ballanced, or the advantage of <hi>Fairs</hi> be enjoyed, where Money is wanting. Which <hi>the Cobler of Agawam,</hi> before he Canonized <hi>Pumpion,</hi> was not so <hi>Simple</hi> but understood full well.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, That Credit passed in</hi> Fund, <hi>by Book, &amp; Bills, (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) will fully supply the defect of</hi> Money. <hi>Wherein is related, of how little value</hi> Coin, <hi>as the Measure of Trade, need be, in it self; what Inconveniences subject to. The worth a</hi> Fund-<hi>Bill, or Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein, is of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; not of that Hazard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although <hi>Cash</hi> be so usefull; yet it is but a ready convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Which hath, through mistake, its esteem, not from the use, (which it ought) but Intrinsic value: which is not essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to a thing, meerly good for Exchange; and serving barely

to procure what One wants, that another abounds with: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to fetch for the last, what he standeth in need of, where to be spared. And this (except here were <hi>Mines,</hi> to transport <hi>bullion,</hi> for foreign Trade) <hi>Bank-bills,</hi> or payments therein, will effect, to all Intents, as well as plenty of Corn; which, <hi>as money,</hi> doth neither Feed, nor Cloath. Moreover, Treasure, not onely allures an Enemy, and is covetously hoarded up; &amp; so, like dung in a heap, unprofitable: but is also subject to <hi>wear <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="3 letters">

And for the <hi>Change-bills,</hi> they may be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, as to be passed with facility; and without counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. However, so as to prevent, or find out, any Cheat: if the Rules of them be observed.</p>
            <p>The other two <hi>Sections</hi> of the <hi>Proposal,</hi> must be pass'd to the 2<hi>d. Sheet, pag. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
