            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>BEfore I ſpeak of the Unlawfulneſs of this Practice of making Slaves, it is in my Mind to give a Relation how, and after what Manner I came to underſtand it ſo; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> why, and for what Reaſon I now ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. After I had arrived to the Years of a Man, I was very deſirous that I might come to know the Lord for my ſelf: For altho' I did believe I was educated or taught the right way, yet upon ſerious Conſideration, I came to ſee that the Religion of a Man's Education, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as not the Religion of his, but of them that educated him: And therefore I was very deſirous to know him for my ſelf; for I read in Scripture, that when Deſtruction came upon the City, that if <hi>Daniel, Noah</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> were in it, they by their Righteouſneſs could ſave none but their own Souls. And altho' I might live in the midſt of a righteous People, I ſaw that it would not avail any thing to me. And as I was thus concern'd, it pleaſed the Lord in his own Time to manifeſt himſelf to me, in ſome ſmall Degree and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:003644_0003_10023B47A3E68570"/>
ſo that then I could diſcern Things aright in ſome degree; and after I had conſidered the Principles of thoſe my Friends called <hi>Quakers,</hi> I did, and now do believe that they are unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably good, and that thoſe that keep cloſe to them. I do believe that there can never any Weapon be formed that ſhall prevail againſt them. And as I conſider'd thereon, I found a Neceſſity in my ſelf to join with thoſe People, whoſe principles were ſo good: Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I muſt confeſs, (and for that Reaſon I now write) that as I knew a Neceſſity to join with them in that which was good; the ſame Neceſſity I now find to ſpeak againſt that which is evil, altho' it may be in ſome of them. For the Lord made me ſenſible in that convincing Day, that he would not allow of Sin, altho' it might be in <hi>Jacob,</hi> and that Tranſgreſſion in <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> ſhould not go unpuniſhed, and that he would yet again ſearch <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as with Candles, and bring to Light the hidden Things of Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty.</p>
            <p>And now, altho' ſome may think it hard to have this Practice ſpoken againſt, that has been carried on ſo long pretty much in Silence; I may let ſuch know, that I have found it hard to write againſt it; yet nevertheleſs believing it to be my Duty ſo to do, I have written according to the Underſtanding I have had thereof. And
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:003644_0004_10023B59DEEDDCA8"/>
altho' I have written but little, and in a very plain Way, yet I hope that thoſe Remarks I have made thereon, may ſerve as a Text for ſome to preach to themſelves upon. I am not unthought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the Ferment or Stir that ſuch Diſcourſe as this may make among ſome, who (like <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> of old) may ſay, By this Craft have we our Wealth, which cauſed the People to cry out with one Voice, ſaying, Great is <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> whom all <hi>Aſia</hi> and the World wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Therefore leaving ſuch to worſhip what they will, I will alſo ſay, that there is many ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Men that has ſpoken againſt this Practice, both by Writing and in their publick Aſſemblies, whom I could Name, but chuſing to be brief, I will only obſerve to the Reader, what I my ſelf have obſerved, and that is, that thoſe People that dwell neareſt the Truth, and are moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it, and are more concern'd for the ſpreading of it, than for any thing in this World beſide, cannot allow of this Practice, they ſeeing it to be Oppreſſion and Cruelty.</p>
            <p>Now I having ſpoken ſomething of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why I have wrote this, I will conclude this my Preface, wiſhing the Reader an impartial Judgment.</p>

            <head>A TESTIMONY Againſt that Antichriſtian Practice of Making Slaves of Men.</head>
            <p>SUCH hath been the Love and Goodneſs of God to Men, that in all Ages of the Word he has had a People, Family or Church whom he hath called and alſo choſen, to bear a Teſtimony to his Name and Truth: Yet it may be obſerved by them that read the holy Scriptures, that thoſe People whom he had called, and favoured above all the Families of the Earth, and had wrought Signs and Wonders for them, and had exalted them in the Sight of their Enemies; that thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Times of Liberty and Eaſe, grew forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003644_0006_10023B864859D910"/>
of God. This aptneſs to forget God in a Time of Eaſe, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> well knew, after that he had a Thorn in the Fleſh, or the Meſſenger of Satan to buffet him (as he calls it) for before he was afflicted he went aſtray, therefore he knew Chaſtiſement or Affliction to be profitable for him, and could then ſay, I take Pleaſure in Infirmities, in Reproaches, in Neceſſities, in Perſecutions, in Diſtreſſes for Chriſt's ſake: For when I am Weak, then am I Strong. 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 12. 10. It may be alſo obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them who read the Book of Martyrs or Sufferings of the People of God, from the Time our Lord was crucified, down to the Reign of the bloody Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> (which Hiſtory I do believe is believed to be true by moſt Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants) that in all that Length of Time, God had a People whom he had called out of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Ways and Cuſtoms of the World, who were a ſuffering People, and that in the midſt of their greateſt Sufferings, they were the moſt immediately upheld by the Divine Power of God; ſo that they could even Rejoice in the Flames. But when it pleaſed God that a good King or Emperor came to Rule, ſo that they were not perſecuted or oppreſſed, that they grew forgetful of God, and ſome of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Oppreſſors themſelves. Now I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God ſometimes afflicteth outwardly, and ſometimes inwardly, who beſt knows the

               </gap> Word, but in Practice alſo, againſt all outward and carnal Weapons; which our Friend <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> obſerving, ſaid, that it was their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Lives and Converſations that convinced him, before ever he inſpected into their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. He did not ſee them in this Practice of making Slaves of their Fellow Creatures, which Practice is upheld by the carnal Sword only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he bore a Teſtimony againſt the carnal Sword, and would not allow of it to be uſed, altho' it were in Self-Preſervation. Such Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency was in that worthy Man, as well as many others in that Day, that they would not allow of this Practice, having more regard to that Command of Chriſt's, (to do to others as we would they ſhould do to us) than to any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Advantage in this World. And after our Friend <hi>George Fox</hi> had travelled in the Iſland of <hi>Barbadoes</hi> in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> where he ſaw this Practice of making Slaves, even to that degree, that their Houſes were black with them, that he bore open Teſtimony againſt it, when he got home he wrote a little Book to them, wherein I find theſe Words, <q>
                  <hi>And if thy Brother, an Hebrew Man, or an Hebrew Woman, be ſold unto thee, and ſerve thee ſix Years, then in the

And when thou ſendeſt him out free from thee, thou ſhalt not let him go away empty: Thou ſhalt furniſh him liberally out of thy Flock, and out of thy Floor, and out of thy Wine-preſs, of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Lord thy God hath bleſſed thee, thou ſhalt give it to him. And remember that thou waſt a Bond man in the Land of </hi> Egypt, <hi>and the Lord thy God redeemed thee: Therefore I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee this Thing to day.</hi> Deut. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12, 13, 14, 15.

This I ſay will be very acceptable to the Lord, whoſe Servants we are, and who rewards us plentifully for our Service done

not ſuffering us to go away empty. For <hi>who is there even among you</hi> (faith the Lord) <hi>that will ſhut the Doors for nought? neither do ye kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a Fire on mine Altar for nought.</hi> Mal. 1. 10. So now you, I ſay, that are Chriſtians, that are redeemed out of the ſpiritual <hi>Egypt;</hi> for as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>He that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Lord being a Servant, is the Lord's Free-man.</hi> That is, ſet free from Sin, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bondage.

            <p>Now by theſe Words (tho' but a ſmall part of what he wrote) we may ſee that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt making Slaves of Men. Now I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve if Men were ingenuous to acknowledge to the Truth, even as their Conſciences bear them Witneſs, I need not go any farther for a Proof againſt this Practice: But becauſe they be not, I will turn alſo to the holy Scriptures, that ſo they that are in this Practice may be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by both.</p>

And thoſe that had Bond-Servants under the Law, were commanded to let them go free after ſome Time of Service, and they were not to let them go empty handed neither, which ſome of them not obſerving, the Lord complained by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> that they <hi>have not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened unto me, in proclaiming Liberty every one to has Brother, and every Man to his Neighbour: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I proclaim a Liberty for you, ſaith the Lord, to the Sword, to the Peſtilence, and to the Famine, and I will make you to be removed into all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the Earth.</hi> Jer. 34. 17.</p>

               <hi>Objection,</hi> But they were of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Command was againſt; now theſe Negroes are not of our own Nation, but are mere Infidels and Strangers. To which Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection I'll Anſwer as it is written in <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 21. <hi>Ye ſhall neither vex a Stranger, nor oppreſs him, for ye were Strangers in the Land of Egypt.</hi> And <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 9. <hi>Alſo thou ſhalt not oppreſs a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for ye know the Heart of a Stranger, ſeeing ye were Strangers in the Land of</hi> Egypt. Now I do not find that it is any more allowable to make a Slave of an Unbeliever, than a Believer, ſeeing we are commanded, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them, for this is the Law

and the Prophets.</hi> Now we may ſee that this was not only a Command of Chriſt's, but was the Law and the Prophets alſo; and thoſe that comes to obſerve that Command, even fulfil both Tables at once. Now I have often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered how earneſtly ſome Men will ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Etemology or Original of ſome Things that may be but ſmall, and in the mean while omit the greater. Now in my Judgment every thing ought to be looked upon according to the Importance, Weight or Value of the Thing; for to be very zealous in a ſmall Thing, and to paſs lightly over a greater, that Zeal may be properer called Superſtition than good Zeal, which ſhould be grounded upon Knowledge. Now I would have all to conſider of this Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of making Slaves of Negroes, or others that we can get the Maſtery over, to ſee upon what Foundation it ſtands, or to ſee whats the Original of it, whether or no Pride and Idleneſs was not the firſt riſe of it, that they might go with white Hands, and that their Wives might (<hi>Jezebel</hi> like) paint and adorn themſelves, and their Sons and Daughters be brought up in Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which may be very well termed the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all Vice; for it is generally the richeſt ſort of People that have them, that could do beſt without them, for the Poor are not ſo able to get them.</p>

But ſome may object, as I my ſelf have heard them, that there was a Mark ſet upon <hi>Cain,</hi> and they do believe that theſe Negroes are the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity of <hi>Cain,</hi> becauſe of their Hair, and their being ſo black, differing from all others, and that <hi>Canaan</hi> was to be a Servant of Servants to his Brethren, whom they take to be of the ſame Linage: But if we do but obſerve, and read in the Genealogy of <hi>Cain,</hi> we may find that they were all drowned in the old World, and that <hi>Canaan</hi> was of the Line of <hi>Seth.</hi> And altho' it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Will of God that the World was drowned, becauſe of their great Wickedneſs; yet we may obſerve alſo, that there was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Beaſts went into the Ark, as well as clean, and that it was the Will or Permiſſion of God, that there ſhould be a <hi>Ham,</hi> as well as a <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet:</hi> By which we may ſee that God ſuffers wicked Men to live as well as Righteous, and we find that the Sun ſhineth on the Evil as well as on the Good, and that the Rain fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth on the Unjuſt as well as the Juſt, and that Chriſt forbids his Followers to meddle with the Tares leſt they hurt the Wheat; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none can have any Plea for making of them Slaves, for their being either ignorant or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for if that Plea would do, I do believe they need not go ſo far for Slaves as now they do.</p>
            <p>And altho' <hi>Canaan</hi> was to be a Servant of Servants to his Brethren, yet the Lord after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

ſpake by the Prophets, that the Son ſhould not bear the Iniquity of the Father, nor the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould not bear the Iniquity of the Son, but the Soul that ſinneth ſhould die. Then the Poſterity of <hi>Canaan,</hi> or of <hi>Ham,</hi> do not bear their Sins: And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Now I perceive of a Truth that God is no reſpecter of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but in every Nation he that feareth God and worketh Righteouſneſs, is accepted of him.</hi> Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' the Negroes might not have the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that ſome other Nations have, then I do believe there is the leſs required, and if they do but as well as they know, I do believe it is well with them. For <hi>John</hi> the Divine faith in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> that he ſaw them that were <hi>ſealed in their Foreheads, of the Tribes of Iſrael, of each Tribe Twelve Thouſand, which made an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Forty and Four Thouſand: And after this I beheld</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>and lo a great Multitude which no Man could Number, of all Nations, and Kindreds, and People, and Tongues, ſtood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white Robes, and Palms in their Hands, and they cried with a loud Voice, ſaying, Salvation to our God, which ſitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb,</hi> Rev. 7. 9, 10. Now if there was of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Kindreds, Tongues and People, then there was ſome of the Negroes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:003644_0015_10023B9BFAE4F338"/>
Now altho' the <hi>Turks</hi> make Slaves of thoſe they can catch, that are not of their Religion, yet (as Hiſtory relates) as ſoon as any embraces the Mahomitan Religion, they are no longer kept Slaves, but are quickly ſet free, and for the moſt part put to ſome place of Preferment; ſo zealous are they for Proſelites and their own Religion. Now if many among thoſe called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> would but conſider how far they fall ſhort of the <hi>Turks</hi> in this Particular, it would be well; for they tell the Negroes that they muſt believe in Chriſt, and receive the Chriſtian Faith, and that they muſt receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be baptized, and ſo they do; but ſtill they keep them Slaves for all this. Now how partial are thoſe that can judge a Negro that ſhould run away from his Maſter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve beating, and if one called a Chriſtian (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' it may be no better Chriſtian than the other) ſhould run away from the <hi>Turks,</hi> they can judge him to be a good Fellow, and to have done well. Now I look upon this Practice of making Slaves to be ſo great a Sin, that even Men whoſe Principles will allow of killing Men in their own Defence, will not allow of making Slaves; for they counting it better to deprive them of Life that riſe up againſt them, than to deprive thoſe of Liberty that have done them no Harm.</p>

Now if any one ſhould ask one of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes Maſters that had a Negro Child and a Child of his own, what Harm the one had done, that it ſhould be made a Slave more than the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they would not I believe be able to anſwer it; and if they have done us no Harm, (as it is evident they have not) then it is very contrary to Scripture, and even to Nature, to make them ſuffer. Now if we will but look back into the Original of this Practice, which ought to be moſt looked into, and ſpoken againſt; for until the Cauſe is removed, I know not how the Effect ſhould ceaſe; we ſhall find that they were ſtollen in the firſt place either by them that fetched them, or they carrying ſuch Goods as induced ſome of their own Nation to ſteal them; and they ſtanding ready to receive them, which is as bad as if they had ſtollen them themſelves.</p>
            <p>Now we may find that Man-ſtealing and Man-ſlaying were joined together, and there was the ſame Puniſhment for the one as for the other. See <hi>Exod<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And he that ſtealeth a Man, and ſelleth him, or if he be found in his Hands, he ſhall ſurely be put to Death.</hi> We may find it alſo in the New Teſtament joined with the worſt of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, as ſuch as were Murderers of Fathers and Murderers of Mothers, and Man-ſtealers,

1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9, 10. The Prohibition is general, he that ſtealeth away Man, a Brother or a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or Heathen, or any Man, the Puniſhment is Capital; for he that killed was to be put to Death, becauſe it was the Image of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 6. So he that robbeth a Man of his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which only maketh Knowledge uſeful, ſeems to deface the Image of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is puniſhed with Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection,</hi> But how can this Practice of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Slaves be ſo great a Sin, when it is ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally practiced among all the Societies of People? For let them differ about what they will elſe, they pretty generally agree about this. To which Objection I Anſwer, That if they did but as well agree about all other Points as they do about this, they might almoſt if not altogether be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med one Community, yet I cannot find this to be a Proof: For I take it for a Maxim, that in a general way, the Negroes are cruelly us'd; and therefore I do not find, that their Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in making Slaves can be an Example for us, any more than their uſing them cruelly. Therefore if we would but conſider the Thing rightly, we ſhall not find that to be a Proof, becauſe it is ſo general a Practice. For we may obſerve how it was when our Lord was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that there was divers Sects of People, and of very differing Minds, yet in putting him to Death they could generally agree; and tho'
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003644_0018_10023B6EF248F0A8"/>
they were ſo much at Variance, that as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is, they were at Daggers drawing, yet the Text has it, <hi>that the ſame Day Pilate and Herod were made Friends.</hi> Yet ſome that have Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have not ſcrupled to call that a curſed Friendſhip, that was contracted by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Death our Lord, that came in Love to their Souls. But I have a further Reply to make to what I have ſaid before, of the general Agreement of making Slaves, <hi>namely,</hi> That there is ſome of all Perſwaſions, I do believe, that cannot allow of this Practice: For they ſeeing it to be contrary to Chriſt's Command, and even to Nature: For I have made this Obſervation my ſelf, (tho' but young in Years) that thoſe that dwell neareſt the Truth, and contend moſt for it, cannot allow of this Practice, for they ſee it to be Oppreſſion and Cruelty. But it may be objected, that there hath ſome ſpoken againſt this Practice, and they have come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or have not proſpered in it. To which I Anſwer, That a good Cauſe may be badly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, and by ſad Experience we often ſee it is ſo. Now I do believe by what hath already been ſaid, that all that have not concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand that they would not ſee, may ſee this Practice of making Slaves to be Antichriſtian; for it cannot be of Chriſt, becauſe contrary to his Command; therefore of Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:003644_0019_10023B7F24C44AE0"/>
Now I have heard ſome Men ſay, that they believe they did wrong in getting Negroes, but that they did not know what to do with them now they had got them; for if they let them go free after ſome Time, if any Miſhap betel them, their Eſtates were obliged to maintain them. And tho' they ſeem to acknowledge the Wrong done to them, yet they ſeem to be very much afraid left they ſhould be forc'd to help them a little, and to ſeem to reſt content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Now, ſuppoſe that to give the Negroes their Times, or let them go free here in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, was wrong, which I do not believe would be wrong, after they had ſerved them ſome time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if it were wrong to let them go free, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no thoſe that ſee they did wrong in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, ought not to bear a Teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it? For their keeping them and being ſilent, encourages others to get them. For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul'</hi>s Advice to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, not to join themſelves in Marriage a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever with an Unbeliever, for he counted it wrong, even ſo do I: But if a Believer had got a Wife that was an Unbeliever, I do not think that he ſhould put her away, yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Practice was wrong, and ought to be ſpoken againſt. Now I can truly ſay, that this Practice of making Slaves of Men, appears to be ſo great an Evil to me, that for all the Riches
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003644_0020_10023B8DB33C5928"/>
and Glory of this World, I would not be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſo great a Sin as this ſeems to be. And I do believe many would ſee it ſo, were they not blinded by Self-Intereſt. Now as I ſaid in the beginning, how apt Men were to forget God in a Time of Liberty, as we now ſeem to have, which if rightly conſidered, we ought the more to remember him, and to priſe his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour therein. For I do believe it Perſecution was on Foot again, and People were haled to Priſons, as they have been in Times paſt, that many would have more regard to their own Practices than now they have. For this Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of making Slaves tends to many Evils, as parting Man and Wife, and Children from them both, and thereby cauſing them to commit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duitery with others, and ſo their Children can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to honour them. And all this is done by Violence, which is forbidden in the Scriptures; for there we are commanded to do Violence to no Man. And laſtly, it is a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to the ſpreading of the Goſpel among thoſe poor Creatures, for whom (as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) our Lord came and laid down his Life, and alſo hath ſaid, that his Goſpel ſhould be preached unto all Nations. But ſome may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as I have heard them, that by this Means they come to hear the Goſpel preached, and they believed this was the Way our Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that Nation ſhould have the Goſpel
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003644_0021_10023B6739069A30"/>
preached to them, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> to be brought Slaves here. To which I'll ſay, the Reader may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſe what People theſe are, for it muſt be them that buy the Goſpel pretty dear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or elſe they would not think that the Negroes ſhould be Bond-Slaves, and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after them, for the Knowledge of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. But I do not find that the Goſpel was either bought or ſold for Money; neither do we find that God compelled any to receive it, but only intreated them or adviſed them to chuſe Life, and live. Now by this Practice they hate the Name of a Chriſtian; for all of us they can get (ſay they) they make Slaves of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and even Nature it ſelf tells them that it is wrong.</p>
            <p>Now I would have all ſeriouſly to conſider, that loves their own Souls, and do believe that they muſt give an Account for the Deeds done in the Body, to look into their own Practices, to ſee upon what Foundation they ſtand; for God will not forgive, what is in our Power to help.</p>
            <p>Now I having ſhewn by Scripture the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs of this Practice, as it is now in Uſe, both in the Old Teſtament and in the New<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And now, I would have all to turn their Minds inward, to that Divine Monitor or Counſellor, placed in the Heart of Man, which is as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003644_0022_10023B9D987BC2E0"/>
to the holy Scriptures (I do believe) as any internal Thing can be to an external one; to which I'll leave my Reader, even to that ever bleſſed Spirit, One with the Father.</p>
