            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Account of the Life and Death of Joſeph Quaſſon, Indian, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WE begin with the Account which the Priſoner gave of himſelf, not many Days before his Execution, which Relation was taken from his Mouth by a faithful and careful Scribe; after the Relator had expreſſed Reluctancy in ſuch Terms as theſe—<hi>To tell the World,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what a ſtupid hardned Creature I have been! What will they ſay? There's a wicked Wretch gone to Hell!</hi>—But being told God might yet do more for him, to be added to the Account afterwards; and that the Communication of theſe Things, to be publiſhed, might be for the Glory of God and good of Souls; he conſented, and
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002782_0004_0FE63373225D8FC8"/>
in Anſwer to various and ſuitable Queſtions propounded to him, as there was found Occaſion. He ſaid—</p>
            <p>I was born at a Place called <hi>Monamoy, March</hi> 28. 1698. Lived with my Parents ſix Years; Then my Father died five Pounds in Debt to Mr. <hi>Samuel Sturges</hi> of <hi>Yarmouth.</hi> I was bound out to him by my Mother on that Account; where I was, as ſoon as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, inſtructed in Reading and in my Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm. My Miſtreſs uſed to tell me, I muſt never Sin, for, Hell was a dreadful Place, where the Workers of Iniquity muſt go. I had then great Fear of Sin. I thought it was a dreadful Thing to tell a wilful Lye, and I don't remember that I then allowed my ſelf in any external Way of Wickedneſs; ſuch as Lying, Swearing, Stealing, &amp;c. which was from the Reſtraints of God upon me. When I have heard the Lord's Name taken in vain by Children, I have reproved them for it; and told them it was a Sin. When I was about thirteen Years old, I had the Care of my Maſter's Warehouſe: I was tempted by ſome young 'Prentices to ſteal Powder for them; but I refuſed, yet I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I ſuffered ſome of them to do it, which troubled me afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:002782_0004_0FE63373225D8FC8"/>
I never drank to Exceſs, till I eighteen Years old, when I was once overtaken; but I had not got an Habit of it, till my Time was out with my Maſter: I was always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a ſtrict and regular Government Night and Day, that I had no Opportunity for it.—I uſed in the Time of my Service, oftentimes to have thought of another World; and uſed to be concerned about get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ready for Death. I uſed to Read and think of Praying to God; but thought I could I could not do that, nor did I ever pray by my ſelf, till I came into this Priſon. I was obliged conſtantly to hear the Word preached, whilſt with my Maſter; and was often much affected. I loved to hear the Word, and continued to do ſo 'till <hi>I</hi> gave way to Company and Drinking; which was ſoon after <hi>I</hi> had my Freedom. <hi>I</hi> went from my Maſter very well clothed, and had, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Things, a new Bible given me. <hi>I</hi> work'd a little, at firſt; but grew <hi>I</hi>dle, and took to Spending, and ſold my Cloaths and other Things; and even my Bible, to maintain my Luſts. My Drunkenneſs hurt my Conſcience very much at firſt; but after a while all was quiet: <hi>I</hi> could ſin without remorſe; and when <hi>I</hi> had brought my ſelf
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002782_0005_0FE63373267EC450"/>
into a poor and ragged Condition, I left the Engliſh Meeting through Shame, where <hi>I</hi> always uſed to appear well clothed: <hi>I</hi> went to the <hi>Indian</hi> Meeting (where <hi>I</hi> underſtood nothing) only to ſave my Fine.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>I</hi> went on in my Wickedneſs 'till the Spring of the Year 1725. without any ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reflection; Then <hi>I</hi> had Thoughts running in my Mind, eſpecially after <hi>I</hi> had been overtaken with Drink, as if one had ſpoken to me; if <hi>I</hi> did not leave off this Practice, it would quickly bring me to Ruin. It was a Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe: but it had little Effect. I could not (becauſe <hi>I</hi> would not) ceaſe from Sin, (This was after <hi>I</hi> came out to the Eaſtward, a Soldier) <hi>I</hi> was more and more ſettled, hardned and ſo, quiet in my ſinful Courſes 'till the Fact was committed, for which I muſt die. About three Weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I killed the Man, I had, one Day, a Thought come into my Mind, That I had been guilty of all manner of Sin, I could then think of none that <hi>I</hi> was free from, but the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and I did not know but I had committed that too: But then I thought of the Sin of Murder, which I had not, outwardly, committed. Now I have committed that Sin too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:002782_0005_0FE63373267EC450"/>
I was at Work with a Man at Cape <hi>Porpus,</hi> about a Fort'ni't before I killed <hi>John Peter,</hi> and in Diſcourſe, he aſked me, what I tho't of my ſelf—and if the Indians ſhould kill me, whither I thought I ſhould go. I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered him, That I ſhould go to Hell, beſure. He asked me, Why? I reply'd, Becauſe I ſhould have no Time to conſider and Repent. And <hi>I</hi> remember I then thought, if I had but Time, I ſhould find it no hard Matter to Repent. And ſo after I was apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and began to think I muſt Die; I tho't and ſaid, I hoped God would give me Time to Repent, but I had no Senſe that God muſt alſo give me an Heart to Repent. I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix Days in Priſon before I heard of the Death of the Indian. I ſpent my Time in reading the Bible and other good Books (and indeed I was wont often to read before this) but never Prayed before my Impriſonment, nor after, 'till the dreadful News that <hi>John Peter</hi> was dead of his Wounds, came to my Ears—. Then I was greatly terrified and amazed with the Apprehenſions of Death, which <hi>I</hi> thought was coming on me, and <hi>I</hi> did not know how ſoon. My Thoughts were much diſturbed: <hi>I</hi> then prayed as well as read; but <hi>I</hi> knew not what I ſaid, <hi>I</hi> was ſo
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002782_0006_0FE63374E79262E8"/>
confuſed. Theſe Terrors I thought did me more Hurt than Good; and <hi>I</hi> ſtrived, what <hi>I</hi> could, to get them out of my Mind; ſo that, after a while, <hi>I</hi> was more eaſy, yet not unconcerned, beſure,—and the more concerned becauſe I thought, being a poor <hi>Indian</hi> and in a ſtrange Place, eſpecially in a Time of War; People would be little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about me. However, <hi>I</hi> thought there was a Miniſter in the Town, and if he were a good Man he would have Compaſſion on my Soul: <hi>I</hi> ſent for him; he told me, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Things, That <hi>I</hi> muſt aggravate and not extenuate my Sin: I thought if I did ſo, <hi>I</hi> ſhould run diſtracted: But after the Confuſion was a little off my Mind, I could read and pray more calmly; and I found many Places of Scripture that encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged me to be ſeeking: However, <hi>I</hi> found my Heart continued ſo hard, that <hi>I</hi> could not repent. When <hi>I</hi> firſt went to Meeting, which was within a Sabbath or two after my firſt Confinement, I was mightily affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and my Heart ſeemed to relent: <hi>I</hi> tho't <hi>I</hi> got a great deal of Good: This continued every Sabbath, for more than two Months, Afterwards my Heart ſeemed hard and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; but not always alike; ſometimes it
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002782_0006_0FE63374E79262E8"/>
ſeemed as if I got ſome Good, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times none. However, I was very diligent, reading and praying, not without great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection at Times,—till the laſt of <hi>February;</hi> from which Time I had a Fellow Priſoner for many Weeks together; which was a great Hindrance to me: He was continually, whileſt awake, either ſinging or full of vain or profane Talk. I then left off Prayer, which <hi>I</hi> had conſtantly practiced four or five Months before; and commonly ſeven or eight Times in a Day. At laſt, I had no Deſire to pray, and neglected going to Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; though ſtill I read more or leſs, every Day, the whole Time of my Confinement; and for the moſt part ſeveral Hours in a Day. When I had again the Advantage of being alone, I thought I muſt betake my ſelf to Prayer, as before, but found my ſelf much at a Loſs: it ſeemed dreadful to come before God again, after I had, for ſo long a Time, left off Prayer! I went to Meeting, but found my Heart harder, than at the worſt, before; I could not think that I got any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Good, for the moſt part: Sometimes I ſhould ſeem a little affected, but nothing as at firſt. I ſhould ſometimes have hard Thoughts why ſhould God leave me to be
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002782_0007_0FE63374EAF58348"/>
guilty of Murder,—but then I thought, he left <hi>David</hi> to fall into the ſame Sin.</p>
            <p>After I was condemned, I was more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: I have continued, ever ſince, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God and waiting on him in the Uſe of all Means, publick and private. I find my Heart is very bad: I have no Good in me. Some Time ago, I was thinking, though I had no true Love to Chriſt, yet I did not hate him: but, on Examination, I diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered plainly that I had Hatred in my Heart againſt Chriſt; which was very terrifying to me. I am thoroughly convinced, now, though I thought otherwiſe at firſt, that I am ſo far from having any Power to change my Heart, that I have no Will to any thing that is Good; nor can I raiſe up one good Deſire in my Heart. I am very ſtupid and unaffected! I have been ſometimes almoſt ready to deſpair: but I have ſtill ſome Hope that God may be gracious to me: I am reſolved by his Grace to ſeek to the laſt; and if I periſh, after all, I think I am tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly convinced that God is righteous; for he owes me nothing. All the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I have is from the Death and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt Jeſus, which is ſufficient to ſave me; and from the powerful Grace
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002782_0007_0FE63374EAF58348"/>
of God which can change my Heart in a Moment,</p>
            <p>Thus having quitted his vain Confidence, and conceived an humble, evangelical Hope in the Mercy of God, the Merits of Chriſt and the al-conquering Power of the Spirit of Grace; his Hope ſenſibly to himſelf, and apparently to others, increaſed more and more to the laſt.</p>
            <p>He had been, at Times, on the very brink of Deſpair, and ſpoken deſperate Words: He would ſometimes ſpeak with an Air of Diſdain, That ſuch a Sinner as <hi>he</hi> ſhould be ſaved! And as tho' 'twere unreaſonable that he ſhould cheriſh the leaſt Hope of it. Yet was he conſtrained to hope in the Divine Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency; having a very diſtinct Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the way of Salvation, by learning the Catechiſm in his Childhood and early Youth; by his conſtant Attendance on the Miniſtry for many Years together; by his natural Love to Reading, from firſt to laſt, and by his great Diligence therein whileſt a Priſoner; together with perſonal Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by a good number of Viſitants; who alſo furniſhed him with Variety of the moſt

ſuitable Books, leſſer and larger; all or moſt of which he deliberately read over; and ſome of them not once only nor twice; <hi>Fox</hi> of Time and the End of Time, and Mr. <hi>Stoddard'</hi>s Guide to Chriſt; with <hi>Char nock</hi> of Man's Enmity againſt God; and God's Mercy to the worſt of Men. were peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſed to him for his Awakening, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, Humiliation, Direction and Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.—Examples alſo, peculiarly that of <hi>Eſther Rogers,</hi> her ſignally marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Converſion and triumphant Death, after repeated Murthers dreadfully aggravated, were of ſpecial Uſe to him. Whileſt Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Prayers were going up for him, in hundreds of Families and many ſcores of Congregations: For there was (in the ſeven Weeks which his merciful Judges allowed him after his Sentence) Opportunity, at the condemned Man's deſire, by Word or Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to beſpeak a publick Remembrance for him of more than an hundred Miniſters of four Provinces and Colonies. And there ſeemed to be much of the Spirit of Prayer in a good number, moving them to ſtrive together and apart for his Converſion: And the poor Soul had a ſort of unaccountable, but unconquerable Expectation that the Lord
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002782_0008_0FE633805110AED0"/>
might convert him at laſt; and was for the moſt part, fixed in his reſolved Purpoſe to be ſeeking and waiting to the laſt Day, Hour, and Minute of his Time: But yet very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that unleſs the Lord gave him an Heart thus to ſeek and wait, he could do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the following Diſcourſe had betwixt the Priſoner and one that viſited him, about ten Days before his Execution, may ſerve to ſhew; as alſo to confirm what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That though for the moſt part he was a Priſoner of Hope (and <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 11, 12. was one Prop to his Hope) yet was he ſometimes almoſt ready to Deſpair.</p>

            <p>—Then the Priſoner took his Bible, that he had from the beginning of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment read much in, and wherein he had ſcores of Leaves turned down. He o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened it and ſhewed the Woman that was now talking with him, ſeveral places in the Prophets, and in the Pſalms, &amp;c. that he had been trying to take Incouragement from. One of them was, Pſal. 119. 18, 19. <hi>Open thou mine Eyes, that I may ſee the wondrous things out of thy Law. I am a ſtranger in the Earth, hide not thy Commandments from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Talk was before he gave his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, although that was firſt inſerted, becauſe it begins with his Birth and Education, His Talk had been much in this ſtrain to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that had viſited him. Some few Days before his Death, One that had himſelf been much exerciſed with Atheiſtical Thoughts,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002782_0010_0FE63381597570D8"/>
asked the Priſoner, Whether he believed that there is a God? He anſwered. Yes, but I don't know him, have no Acquaintance with him, am an utter Stranger to him. The ſame Perſon asked him at another Time, Whether he repented. He ſaid he could not repent. You <hi>will</hi> not repent ſaid the good Man. He conſented and owned that he had no Will to repent.</p>
            <p>He was asked by another, How he knew that he was in an unconverted Eſtate: His Anſwer was, That he had no Faith in Chriſt. Query, How do you know that? Anſw. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Faith works by Love,</hi> and I have no Love to that which is good. Q. What do you think would convert you? A. Beſure not all the means in the World: It muſt be God alone. Q. But what will God do, or what muſt be done by him in order to your Converſion? A. I never had the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs of Chriſt diſcovered to me, yet: If ever I be converted I ſhall have Chriſt revealed to my Soul, and that will convert me at once.</p>
            <p>Once he thus expreſſed his Senſe of the Greatneſs and Difficulty of the work of Converſion, or a thorough turning from the Evil of their way that Sinners have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002782_0011_0FE633815CCA7BC0"/>
to, ſays he, ſuch an one (naming one of his own Nation) came to me t'other Day, and deſired me to give him Warning, I did warn him from my Example to beware of the Sin of Drunkenneſs. He went away, ſeemingly, reſolved to take Warning: But 'twas not long before he came again to the Jayle, and was in Drink when he came. So that (ſays <hi>Joſeph</hi>) when I am hanged, and if twenty more ſhould, by their Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, bring themſelves to the ſame wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful End, yet the reſt will not take Warning. He was asked what Advantage, then it would have been to him, might he have been acquitted and ſet at Liberty on his Trial, or to have a Pardon, if that were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable. He acknowledged 'twould moſt probably, have been his Ruine, yea, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd his Fears leſt, after all, Iniquity would be his Ruine. But ſaid, he had much more Hope of being brought to Repentance by his Confinement and certain Expectation of Death, than he could otherwiſe have. Nay, he ſpake as if he could have no Hope at all that he ſhould have any Heart to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his Liberty unto a Reformation of his former Life, though his Life might be given him on that Condition. And therefore
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002782_0011_0FE633815CCA7BC0"/>
would often be ready to ſay, in Anſwer to Queſtionings and Expoſtulations about theſe things,—That it was better for him to die, than to live. The Death of the Body, ſaid he, is nothing, were it not for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Death.</p>
            <p>He was, both before, and after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, full of his Complaints about his Darkneſs, Deadneſs and hardneſs of Heart: He would ſay he had an Heart like a Devil; and was free to acknowledge that having hardened his own Heart, by neglecting the means of Grace for ſo many Years together, after his Time was out with his Maſter, and going on wilfully in Sin, particularly the Sin of Drunkenneſs, for more than ſeven Years together. God might juſtly, now, give him up to blindneſs of Mind; and hardneſs of Heart, to his eternal Ruine. And thus by a full Diſcovery of his utter Inability to help himſelf, and extream Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs to obtain help from the LORD, he was brought by a mighty work of the Spirit, diſcovering alſo to him the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Right of Dominion God had over him, as to Body and Soul, for Time and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, he was conſtrained to ſurrender him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up into the LORD's Hands, to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002782_0012_0FE6338BDF3044A8"/>
of according to his Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Juſtifying God however he ſhould pleaſe to deal with him.</p>
            <p>He had juſtifyed God and Man in the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict and Sentence: had acknowledged and admired the Mercy, as well as Equity of his Judges, in the fair Trial he had. He ſaid to one of the Miniſters, that if one of the Judges, himſelf, ſhould have been Tried for his Life, he could not have had a fairer Trial. And how expreſs and ready was he in his Anſwer to the uſual Queſtion before the pronouncing of Sentence, Have you any thing to ſay why Sentence of Death ſhould not be pronounced upon you, <hi>I have nothing againſt it,</hi> were the Words of his Anſwer, and he continued to acquieſce in the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of his Sentence, even to the laſt. To One that talked with him, upon this Head, he ſaid, I prayed juſt before my Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al came on, that Juſtice might take place; and I am ſatisfied that <hi>I am Guilty, and have Juſtice done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, as was ſaid, he was brought to juſtify God, though He ſhould Sentence him to ſuffer the Pains of the <hi>ſecond</hi> Death. And to a good Woman that viſited him ſome conſiderable Time before his Execution, he
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002782_0012_0FE6338BDF3044A8"/>
expreſt it as his Wiſh, that he might never have hard Thoughts of God, though he ſhould throw him into Hell.</p>
            <p>He had, in the mean time, as hath been once and again before obſerved, a ſecret Hope rooted in him (though the actings of it, in Times of extraordinary Temptation, were ſuſpended) that there might be Mercy in Reſerve for him at laſt, and Forgiveneſs with God, ſo that his Purpoſe of Seeking and Waiting to the End, was never quite broken off. That Word in 1 Pet. 1. 13. was a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Support to him, <hi>Wherefore gird up the loyns of your Mind; be ſober and hope to the End, for the Grace that is to be brought unto you at the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> There was no Text of Scripture that did more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly relieve him, the laſt Week of his Time, than this: He would be ſpeaking of it, over and over; ſo that one of the Miniſters, that in the abſence of the Miniſter belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Place, was moſt converſant with him, prepared a Diſcourſe upon it; and not having Opportunity before the Priſoners Death to preach it in publick, he read or preached it to him, privately in the Priſon, for his further Incouragement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:002782_0013_0FE6338BE287DFD0"/>
When his laſt Sabbath came, his Spirit, through the Violence of Temptation (the Adverſary having but a ſhort Time) ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be under very extraordinary Agitations: One thing that diſcovered it, was an Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Import, that dropt from him; If I have not Comfort or Relief this Sabbath, I fear I ſhall be utterly diſcouraged. The Subject of the publick Diſcourſes, that Day, was <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55. 6. <hi>Seek ye the Lord while be may be found, call ye upon him while he is near. Let the wicked for ſake his way and the unrighteous Man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, for he will have Mercy upon him, and to our God for he will abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardon. For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, ſaith the Lord.</hi> But it pleaſed ſovereign Grace to maintain his Hope, and renew his Incouragement, to wait unto the End.</p>
            <p>Aftet this, a very remarkable Alteration was obſerved in him; he was carried above the amazing Fear of Death. He expreſſed much more of a Spirit of Thankfulneſs for what was done for the promoting of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and Preparation for what was, now, juſt before him. Repeated and reiterated
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002782_0013_0FE6338BE287DFD0"/>
Prayers were made with him, as well as for him, and he ſeemed much more affected, and even melted. He had clearer Diſcoveries of the Fulneſs and ſuitableneſs of Chriſt; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his humble Deſires of believing on him. As for any thing in him, or done by him, in the leaſt, to recommend him to the Divine Acceptance,—he utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed any ſuch thing. The Knowledge he had acquired (though marvellous to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,) the Duties he had performed, the Pains he had taken, the Abſtinence he had exerciſed, &amp;c. was all nothing, and leſs than nothing, in his own Account, yea worſe than nothing, in point of Juſtification. He could look back and remember with Grief and Shame, how much he had, aforetime, and after his Confinement, been under the power of a ſelf-righteous Spirit. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, he obſerved, how that when one told him, as at his firſt coming into Priſon, that he had eight or nine Months time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in. His ſecret thoughts were that he ſhould accompliſh the Work in a quarter of that time: But now he expreſſed, to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Viſitant, his Wonder that any graceleſs Soul ſhould hope to do any thing, before Converſion, that might, in the leaſt, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002782_0014_0FE6338DC2D72C40"/>
ſuch an one to the Favour of God: So that (we truſt) he was thoroughly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled out of himſelf, and brought unreſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to juſtify God, and ſubmit unto his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable and righteous ſovereign Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, which preparatory Work, as Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> obſerves, if it be clear, the Souls cloſing with Chriſt is unqueſtionable. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, It is not known that he expreſſed himſelf as having a ſenſe of the Love of Chriſt to any, but one gracious Woman; who was very inquiſitive into his Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; &amp; among other things ſhe asked him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had not found, at ſome times, a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Love to Chriſt: He ſaid he had; but, ſaid he, I found by reading one of the little Books I have by me, I was miſtaken; and reached the Book and ſhewed her the Place that had, as he called it, ſhewn him how he was miſtaken; and that his Love to Chriſt was not ſuch as true Believers or converted Perſons have. The good Woman can't remember the Title of the Book, nor diſtinctly relate what ſhe read or heard him read out of it; but only a Paſſage to this Purpoſe, There's no Grace of the Spirit, or true Grace, which we would have, or think we have,—but the falſe Spirit can fit
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002782_0014_0FE6338DC2D72C40"/>
us, to an Hair, with a Counterfeit. He ſpake of it, with great Concern, that the Devil ſhould have ſuch Power in counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting, &amp;c. ten Times expreſſing his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing Fear that his Faith and Love and all was but counterfeit Grace. To another good Woman, that viſited him, the Night before his Death, he expreſſed great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and ſome Fear. Here I am to Night, ſaid he, but where ſhall I be to morrow Night: Yet being asked whether he was willing to die, he readily anſwered that he was; and ſaid he had rather die than live; and mentioned again that of <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Epiſtle 1 Chap. 13. Ver.—<hi>Hope to the End, for the Grace that is to be brought unto you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>On the laſt Morning of his Life, his Faith and Hope was found to continue, &amp; ſtill to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing more and more. The Miniſter that preached the Lecture, prayed with him in the Priſon,—God was wonderfully preſent, the Priſoner much affected and melted.</p>
            <p>The Text from which he heard a moſt ſeaſonable Diſcourſe, and therein heard his laſt, was <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 42, 43. <hi>And be ſaid unto Jeſus, Lord, remember me when thou comeſt into thy Kingdom. And Jeſus ſaid unto him,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002782_0015_0FE6338DC6E1CB88"/>
Verily, I ſay unto thee, To day ſhalt thou be with me Paradiſe.</hi> After the Lecture poor <hi>Joſeph</hi> was asked which of the Miniſters he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired might, pray at the Place of Execution: He readily ſignified his Deſire, that the Miniſter that preached (and had prayed with him in the Morning) might pray with and for him at his Death.</p>
            <p>At the Time appointed for the Man of Death to take his laſt ſteps, moſt of the Miniſters of the County, and ſeveral others, accompanied him on his way,—The Mile's Walk was improved in directing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging &amp; cautioning the Priſoner of Hope; who, again &amp; again expreſſed his Hope, but very modeſtly: As for Inſtance; He was ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Do you believe that the Lord is <hi>willing</hi> as well as <hi>able</hi> to ſave you? He anſwered, Yes, I deſire to believe. On the firſt ſight of the Sea, on the ſhore of which was the Place of Execution, He was asked, whether he could venture upon the Ocean of Eternity in the Ark Chriſt? He ſaid, Yes. He was told, that was Faith: He returned, I am not ſure I have Faith, whereas he had all along, 'till a little before this Day, confidently denied that he had any ſaving Faith. At firſt ſight of the Gallows, he was asked, whether the Sight
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002782_0015_0FE6338DC6E1CB88"/>
were not not terrifying to him? He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, No; not at all. And indeed, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, his Words; for Matter &amp; Manner; and his whole Behaviour in the Way to and at the Place of Execution, ſhewed plain eno' that he was very much above the Prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of any ſuch thing as ſlaviſh Fear.</p>
            <p>The Gallows was fixed in a Valley, with Hills on the one ſide, and on the other, ſo that the numerous Spectators (they were by Conjecture about three Thouſand: there having been no ſuch Example in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for more than ſeventy Years) had an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Proſpect. After one of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters had prayed, &amp;c. the humble Penitent chearfully aſcended the Ladder, and gave Warning to the People, in the following Words, <hi>I would have you all take Warning by me, I am come here to die a ſhameful Death; and I acknowledge the Juſtice of God in it, 'tis Drunkenneſs that has brought me to it. I would have you all to leave off your Drunkenneſs; for if you don't leave it off, it will certainly bring you to ſome dreadful End.</hi> Then he prayed ſo freely, ſo diſtinctly, &amp; ſo pertinently, that it was to the Admiration of the Wiſeſt and Beſt; the moſt impartial and judicious that heard him: But for want of the ſeaſonable

Penning it down, the Reader can't have ſo full &amp; exact an Account of the Prayer, as of the ſhorter Warning.</p>
            <p>In his Prayer he addreſſed God as moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; glorious; He acknowledged that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was a great Sinner, &amp; that his Sins were attended with very extraordinary Aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for he confeſſed that he had ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt great Light &amp; Knowledge, that he had ſinned away bleſſed ſeaſons of Grace; in cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God for Mercy notwithſtanding his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny &amp; great Sins, he pleaded the diſcovery God had made of his merciful Nature, That he delighted not in the Death of a Sinner, &amp;c. He pleaded the Merit and Virtue of the Blood of Chriſt (which he called the Blood of Sprinkling) as ſufficient to cleanſe from all Sin, how heinous ſoever! begging Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Cleanſing, alone, for Chriſt's ſake. He acknowledged his Inability to do any thing, and unworthineſs to receive any thing. Begging that God would make him ſuch as He would have him to be; &amp; that he might be ſprinkled with the Blood of Chriſt. And expreſly committing his Spirit into the Hands of his Saviour, he concluded with a proper Doxology: and having once more,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002782_0016_0FE6339446418C18"/>
in anſwer to a proper Queſtion put to him by one of the Miniſters, very modeſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his Hope, as often before; he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (ſome thought even unto Exceſs) a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to die.</p>
            <p>It was obſerved that the great Aſſembly of Spectators, were generally much affected, perhaps almoſt beyond Example.</p>
            <p>Several Things in the All-diſpoſing, very myſterious and ſuper-abundantly gracious Providence of God our Saviour, relating to the Subject of the preceding Account, ſeem worthy of Obſervation and ſpecial Remark.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That being left Fatherleſs, he ſhould be caſt into a Family where he was made acquainted with the holy Scriptures, and the firſt Principles of the Oracles of God from his Childhood: ſo that by the Bleſſing of God upon the publick, together with theſe more than ordinary private Means and Pains that were, by his good Maſter and Miſtreſs, uſed and taken with and for him, he attained to more than a barely ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient meaſure of Doctrinal Knowledge,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002782_0017_0FE6339449A25AB8"/>
to lay the Foundation of his after-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the bloody Fact for which he was to die ſhould be ſo timed in the Commiſſion of it, as that he had almoſt three quarters of a Year's ſpace of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, before his Trial could come on, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fixed Courſe and Circuit of publick Juſtice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That his Judges, after they had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a wiſe Zeal, becoming the Robe and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem of Righteouſneſs and Judgment, with which they are always cloathed and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſhould, at the humble and earneſt ſuit of this Man of Death, mercifully grant him ſeven Weeks farther ſpace, after his Condemnation, before this Execution!—Yet was the Matter ſo ordered in the good Providence of God, for the more effectual engaging of him to improve every Inch of his Time, that for a Month together, he never knew that he had two Days to live!</p>
            <p n="4">4. That there had been ſtirred up for him a Spirit of fervent and effectual Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002782_0017_0FE6339449A25AB8"/>
ſolitary and ſocial; in a Courſe of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Meetings and in ſmaller Numbers more reſervedly meeting together—That there ſhould be Opportunity, at the Anniverſary Convention of Miniſters, and otherwiſe by Word and Writing, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the condemned Man's Deſires of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to more than an hundred—the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of four Colonies—and great many Thouſands had opportunity to joyn with their Miniſters in praying down the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace on a Soul that deſired it more than Life!—Thus when the Lord has a ſingular and ſignal Work of marvellous Grace in Hand,—He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to oblige many—by intereſting them in it. And if a Soul be, thus, ſaved from Death, and a multitude of Sins co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; the abundant Grace, through the Thankſgiving of many, will redound to the Glory of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That one of the greateſt Hindrances that he met with; or that, indeed, could have fell in his Way to obſtruct him in his great Work, ſhould be over ruled to forward it! For his being, after almoſt half a Year's Abſtinence from ſtrong Drink, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002782_0018_0FE633968B58BD48"/>
again by a Drunken Companion; and diverted, for whole Weeks, from his daily Courſe of Meditation, Reading and Prayer, was made wonderfully ſubſervient to a more thorough Conviction; as to the Power of Sin in him, his Impotency to deliver himſelf, and wretched Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to obtain Help from the Lord: So that the Work of Humiliation ſeemed to be much advanced in him by this irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Temptation!</p>
            <p>Two Things might ſomething confirm this Suppoſition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he plainly and with Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, told one of us, after his Delivery from the Society, naturally ſo pleaſing to him, That he had as lieve have the Devil with him, as ſuch a drunken and ranting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. After this Trial and Relapſe, he once and again declared (yea ſeemed to be fixed in the ſame Mind to the laſt) that he had rather die than be ſet at Liberty, as deſpairing of ever conquering, but by being out of the Way of Temptation!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:002782_0018_0FE633968B58BD48"/>
And now what are the Leſſons of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, Admonition, &amp;c. that we are taught by ſuch an Example as this?</p>
            <p n="1">1. O the mighty Power of Sin and Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom therein! No Cords, no Chains ſo ſtrong! How eaſily did <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſnap in ſunder the ſeven green Withs and new Ropes, ſetting himſelf at Liberty from ſuch kind of Bonds,—yet was held with the Cords of Sin, <hi>Judges</hi> 16. Much more the wicked, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 22. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, in the Man among the Tombs, could pluck Chains aſunder, and break Fetters of Iron in pieces; but the Chains of Sin and Guilt, they can never break.—Our guilty <hi>Joſeph</hi> in Irons, after ſo many Months Abſtinence from his beloved Luſt of Drunkenneſs, is again, taken in the Expectation, of a ſpeedy and violent Death, overtaken and carried Captive, in Time of Temptation; and could not be recovered 'till the Occaſion was removed. Nor may we expect to conquer our own Iniquity, but by avoiding the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons leading to it, as much as poſſible. Particularly, the Sin of <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> is ſeldom if ever ſubdued, unleſs it be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002782_0019_0FE63396907E03F0"/>
by a total Abſtinence; at leaſt for a conſiderable number of Months, if not Years,—'till the inordinacy of this unnatural Thirſt, expire for want of Oyl to maintain the Flame.—</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſee, in this Example, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Hazard of preſent Delays, in Hope of a more convenient Seaſon, <hi>Acts</hi> 25. 24. Deluded Souls venture on a little further in Sin, not doubting but they ſhall be able and willing to ſet about the Work of Repentance, and go thorough with it, at their Leiſure. Poor <hi>Joſeph,</hi> once, tho't ſo too—. But hear what, being Dead, he now ſpeaketh,—<hi>I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by three quarters of a Year's Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience how utterly impoſſible it was for me, even under great Advantages, all Means and Helps, publick and private, and in the amazing Proſpect of Eternity, even at the very brink of it, to raiſe up in my ſelf ſo much as one good Deſire. O therefore take Warning by me, and improve your preſent Seaſons of Grace:</hi> For <hi>Delays are dangerous; exceeding dangerous!</hi>

3. Awakened Sinners may learn two Things farther from this Example: Firſt, Not to be diſcouraged; not to ſink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Diſcouragement in the Uſe of Means, though the LORD may, for their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and greater Humiliation, ſeem long to defer,—'Twas the laſt Week of poor <hi>Joſeph'</hi>s Life, before he had any comfortable Diſcovery to his inward Man, the hidden Part, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. 6. (Though he knew it Doctrinally from his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and that with much diſtinctneſs, eſpecially after his Confinement) how that Jeſus was willing as well as able to ſave from Sin and Wrath. <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 21. 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 10. With <hi>John</hi> 6. 37. Yet (excepting the Diverſion and Pull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back for too long a Time) he held on in the Uſe of Means, publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate—He read many Hours in a Day; eſpecially in his Bible—He prayed ſeven Times in a Day,—And was glad to have all Occaſions of, and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to his beloved Sin removed.—Nor did he thus wait for nothing, or ſeek in Vain. This—for the Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of awakened Sinners! But then
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002782_0020_0FE5F54C9193A628"/>
for our Caution and Direction,—O the inexpreſſible Difficulty, and yet abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Neceſſity of renouncing all our Pains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in the Uſe of Means, or Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Duty,—Self-denial, &amp;c. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with whatſoever may be attained by the moſt ſollicitous, diligent and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient waiting, were it even unto the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of all Myſteries and all Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, &amp;c. (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2.) Yet muſt all, in our Eſteem, be no better than Dung and Droſs in Point of <hi>Juſtification</hi> before God, and Acceptance with him. Herein Chriſt and the Knowledge of him,—Union to him, and Acceſs to the Father through him, is all in all. And here this believing Penitent found Reſt to his Soul, when he could find it no where elſe: Reſt and Peace he found, though ſovereign Wiſdom did not ſee it good and ſafe, either for himſelf or others, that he ſhould have the ſuperiour Joy of Faith; which all, but the Ignorant, know is not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Learn hence a Leſſon of Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the God of Love for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints of his Grace and Providence.

It's poſſible, Reader, thou haſt been held back from the groſſer out-breaking of Sin, even from thy Childhood up,—A few Names were found in <hi>Sardis,</hi> that had not defiled their Garments.—Yet know, if thou wouldeſt not have thy Offering rejected as the proud Phariſee's was thy Soul muſt be humbled within thee, for the <hi>Murder</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> of thy <hi>Heart.</hi> Mark. 7. 21.

<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002782_0021_0FE6339B8B0FAA40"/>
Name and Eſtate; Body and Soul.—A Sin, by which many ſhorten their Days not only meritoriouſly, but efficiently; and if they eſcape Puniſhment from Men, yet the Lord may, poſſibly find them guilty of their own Blood, with reſpect to Soul and Body, both, before his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Tribunal. As there's Poyſon that will lie in a Man's Body many Years—waſting him 'till it kill him at laſt, as ſurely as the ſtrongeſt and largeſt Potion of what will have the quickeſt and moſt deadly Operation. Now, if I take the ſlow and ſure-killing Poyſon after I am informed of it's Nature and Tendency to deſtroy me, and after I have obſerved it's deadly Effect on others,—I am as truly a Self-Murderer, as if I ſhould take a Doſe of Rats-Bane that would kill me the ſame Day or Hour. The Application is eaſy,—but 'tis not eaſy to bring the Guilty to make Application to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. God alone can do it. And he can make ſuch thankful, as have been the happy Subjects of Reſtraining Grace; without which they, alſo, would long enough ago have brought themſelves to publick Shame—to the Gallows, to

Hell!—That the worſt Outrages and bloody Murders—yea and worſe Facts than theſe; even ſuch as it is a Shame to ſpeak of, are not commonly committed—to bring about <hi>Sodom'</hi>s Day again, is owing to Variety of Reſtraints, that God lays upon Man: And <hi>not to us, not to us; but to his Name be Glory!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Let us all be cautioned againſt <hi>raſh Anger,</hi> furious Paſſions, malicious and revengeful Thoughts, Words and Actions,—fixed Hatred of our Neighbour, and the like Tendencies unto, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of the crying Sin of Murder. Matth. 5. 21, 22. 1 John 3. 15.—And if he that hateth his Brother, be a Murderer, how many Murderers be there that go about our Streets, and joyn in the publick Worſhip,—Soul-Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers too—ſuch as Imprecate Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on themſelves and others—hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Impiety!

6. But ſince it was Drinking to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs that betrayed poor <hi>Joſeph</hi> into the bloody Fact, rather than any rooted Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice—Let his Example be for our Admonition. Therefore, he ſays in his Warning on the Gallows,—It is <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs</hi> that has brought me to this ſhameful End,—I would have you all take Warning by me,—Nor was he the firſt, by Scores, that have been brought to the ſame End in this Land, by Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs; beſides Thouſands and Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands in other parts of the World,—Yet as this poor Man had lamented in the Priſon and ſaid (we wiſh to God it may not prove too true, as a Prediction) when I am hanged—and if twenty more, ſhould by their Drunkenneſs, be brought to the like woful End, the reſt will not take Warning.—Remember, 'tis God that warns us by Man, by dying Malefactors; by living Miniſters, and by his lively Oracles. How awful and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,—how amazingly dreadful is that Commination in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19, 20,—If Men were not more unbelieving than De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, they could not but tremble at it,

            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Yet let not the worſt of Sinners deſpair of Mercy,—ſeeking it in Seaſon, and in Earneſt;—This poor Soul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he committed Murder, (in the ſight of Man) had (by his own Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) been guilty of all manner of Sin,—ſinned againſt great Light and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,—abuſed ſingular and very diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Mercies and Favours: And in all, had done Violence to his better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, awakened Conſcience.—Yet (it's hopeful) found Mercy at laſt,—af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much Pains-taking and long Waiting,—after ſore Conflicts and deep Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,—Mark. 3. 28. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, all Sins ſhall be forgiven unto the
