            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>By this Law and laſt Charter (wherein the Proprietary, according to his Right made one ſide of the agreement, which he could not alter or avoid without the Concurrence of the parties concerned on the other ſide) it is evident, That the whole Legiſlative Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity here is lodged in the Governour and Repreſentatives of the People; and I have met none ſo ſenceleſs as to ſay, that the Governour is thereby concluded of having a Council to adviſe and aſſiſt in Legiſlation and other matter relating to the State, and I have known divers of the Members of that Board very ſerviceable in that Station, and, I doubt not, may be ſo ſtill, therefore I deſire they may not withdraw from their Service nor inſiſt upon a Negative to the Acts of thoſe that Repreſent them, which, by a reaſonable Conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſaid Law and Charte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that abridge or reſtrain the Authority granted him by Commiſſion to Exerciſe the Powers of Government in this Province, the ſame is void, as appears by the above cited Reſolutions, from whence it may be obſerved how careful the Law is to keep Powers entire, as the beſt means to preſerve good Order in States and Governments, where no ſuch abſurdity can be admitted, as to allow the Perſons Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to controul the Acts of their Repreſentatives, eſpecially in thoſe Matters which the other Branch of the Legiſlature may think to be reaſonably Propoſed.</p>
            <p>And altho' the Law declares, that Bonds and Covenants (given to Guard the Principal, when he would diminiſh or abridge the Power of his Deputy) are Repugnant to his Office, and therefore void and againſt Law, having a tendency to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> for diſcharging of his Truſt and Duty in the Adminiſtration of the Government according to the purport of the ſaid Royal Grant and the Laws and Conſtitutions of this Province; I conceive that in thoſe Caſes ſuch Security is binding upon the Governour and will be moſt effectual and available in Law, unleſs ſome illegal or repugnant Condition be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>As to the Power of making Ordinances with the aſſertance of other Perſons that the People's Delegates, it appears by the Patent, that thoſe Ordinances cannot be Extended, in any ſort, to bind change or take away the Right or Intereſt of any Perſon or Perſons for or in their Life, Members, Free-hold, Goods or Chattels, nor are they directed to be made except ſudden Accidents happen, whereto it may be neceſſary to apply Remedy, before the Free-holders or their Delegates can be aſſembled to make Laws,—Beſides our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers (who ought to have Notice of ſuch Occaſions) may be convened as ſoon as the Magiſtrates and Officers of the reſpective Counties, who are to aſſiſt in making Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: But if the Ordinance-makers ſhould happen to get the ſtart; yet when the Delegates of the People come together and acquaint the Governour of their readineſs to aſſiſt him in the publick Service of the Government, and to anſwer the Exigences thereof, I think the Power of making Ordinances ſhould then be waved, and the Legiſlative Authority applyed to, becauſe their Acts are deemed more Extenſive and Binding, as appears by the expreſs Words of the ſaid Patent.</p>
