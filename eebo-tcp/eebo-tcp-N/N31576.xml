            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>DEATH, is a melancholy Subject to employ our Meditations; yet a Subject we have daily Occaſion, with all Seriouſneſs, to bear upon our Minds, and are frequently invited, by particular Occurrences of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, to contemplate: It is a Change ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and, withal, ſo very important, view'd in itſelf, and its Conſequences, that it highly concerns the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> to enter into the moſt frequent and affecting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of it. 'Tis peculiarly fit and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as loudly admoniſh us of our exceeding Frailty, and utter uncertainty of Life, and naturally ſuggeſts a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of uſeful Thoughts and Reflections. Such is the awful Occurrence of divine Providence which hath brought us together at this Time. The Occaſion is indeed very ſolemn and ſorrowful, and demands our moſt ſerious and awakened Attention. We are here preſented with ſuch a Spectacle as our Eyes never ſaw before—with ſuch a Scene of Mourning and Wo, as we are unuſed to, conſidered in all its Circumſtances. Behold! there lie the <hi>Corpſes</hi> of three YOUNG MEN, lately cut down in the Prime of Life not in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Way, but by one inſtantaneous Blow, quick and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den as the <hi>Lightning's</hi> Flaſh! There ſit the ſorrowful
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:041713_0005_101B1161C43F20B0"/>Parents, and other ſurviving Relatives of the Deceaſed, deeply touched with the ſudden and ſhocking Event, and ſadly bewailing their Loſs; whoſe Affliction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaks our friendly Sympathy and Compaſſion, in ſome ſuch Language as that in Job xix. 21. <hi>Have Pity upon me, have Pity upon me, O ye my Friends, for the Hand of God hath touched me.</hi> And ſhall we not all be affected with this ſorrowful Event, and, as both the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Chriſtianity dictates, lament the ſudden and untimely Death of theſe <hi>young Men,</hi> and mourn with them that mourn?</p>
            <p>BUT then it behoves both the Bereaved, and Us, to regulate our Thoughts, Affections, and Behavior, on this ſorrowful Occaſion, by the Rules of Piety and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and to manifeſt a due Reverence and Regard to GOD, the ſupreme Governor of the World, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diſpoſer of all Events; by whoſe juſt Decree, and unchangable Appointment, the Sentence of Death is paſſed upon all Mankind, and whoſe all-governing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence determines the Number of every Man's Days, and the particular Time, and Manner of his Death. Accordingly I have choſen the Words of the Text, now read, to entertain you with, on this mournful Occaſion. <hi>Seeing his Days are determined, the Number of his Months are with thee, thou hoſt appointed his Bounds that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſs.</hi> They are the Words of pious <hi>Job,</hi> which he uttered in the Day of his ſore Calamity, when he was greatly oppreſſed, in Body and Mind, with the Miſeries of human Life. In the 1ſt and 2d <hi>Verſes,</hi> he expreſſes an affectionate and ſorrowful Senſe of the Brevity, Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and Uncertainty of human Life: <hi>Man that is born of a Woman, is of few Days, and full of Trouble: He cometh forth like a Flower, and is cut down; he fleeth alſo as a Shadow, and continueth not.</hi> This he repreſents as a general or univerſal Caſe. And, in the Text, he uſes ſeveral Expreſſions, importing the divine Sovereignty, and Prerogative, in diſpoſing of Man, determining the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of his Days and Months upon Earth, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:041713_0006_101B1163B33B1108"/>the Period of Life, beyond which none can paſs. This Truth, well attended to, affords ſeaſonable and uſeful Reflections, proper to influence and direct our Temper and Behavior, under the troubleſome Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that befal us; and may ſerve, eſpecially, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us to Reſignation and Contentment, under ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Bereavments. The <hi>Truth</hi> then, to be illuſtrated and improved, is this, viz.</p>
            <q>That Man's Days upon Earth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>

               </gap>, and the Time and Manner of his Death fined, which he cannot paſs or avoid.</q>

            <p n="1">I. <hi>I ſhall ſay Something by Way of Illuſtration of this Truth.</hi> That Mankind are Mortal, and deſtin'd to a ſhort Continuance here, is indiſputable Fact. The Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death is paſſed upon all Men, without any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, or Diſtinction. And however different they may be, in other Reſpects, there is this one Event, that comes alike to them. <hi>Is there not an appointed Time to Man upon Earth? Are not his Days alſo as the Days of on Hireling?</hi> Job vii. 1. <hi>It is appointed unto Man once to die,</hi> Heb ix. 27. The Cauſe hereof is aſſigned by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. v. 11. <hi>Wherefore, as by one Man Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin; and ſo Death paſſed upon all Men, for that all have ſinned.</hi> But though Death be the common Lot of <hi>All,</hi> and none are exempted from it, yet there is a great Variety, as to the Time, Manner, and Circumſtances of it, conſidered with Reſpect to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals.</hi> There is no ſtated Time, no certain Number of <hi>Days, Months,</hi> or <hi>Years</hi> fixed, to which every One lives that is born into the World, and beyond which no One doth paſs; but Some are deſtin'd to a longer, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to a ſhorter Stay in the World. This Matter is under the immediate Conduct of a moſt wiſe and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Providence, and all Things, relative to it are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:041713_0007_101B1166C6FB6250"/>by the unerring Wiſdom of the ſupreme Lord of All, and ſovereign Diſpoſer of all Events that take Place in the World. In GOD's Hand is the Life and Breath of all Mankind; and he claims it as his Prerogative to kill, and to ſave alive. Every Man that comes into the World, is entirely dependant upon GOD for his Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Continuance in Life. He that gave us Life, and Being, limits the Time of Life to every One, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Pleaſure of his own Will. The Time when, the Manner how, and the Place where, he ſhall make his Exit, is determined by Him. <hi>His Days</hi> even <hi>the Number of his Months are with God,</hi> and, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by him, the Bounds to which he ſhall come, and beyond which he ſhall not paſs, are fixed by his unchangable Appointment. GOD, as the Author of Life and Death, acts herein with ſovereign Power and Freedom, and a wiſe and uncontroulable Dominion, <hi>Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? Who will ſay unto him, What doſt thou?</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">Job ix 12.</note> Death, in every Inſtance and in every Form, is GOD's providential Act: And, whenever he iſſues forth the dread Command, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires our Souls of us, we muſt obey; nor can we, by any Means or Power whatever, reſiſt his Will, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the fatal Stroke, or put off the Execution of it to a longer Period. <hi>There is no Man that hath Power over the Spirit, to retain the Spirit; neither hath he Power in the Day of Death: And there is no Diſcharge in that War.</hi>
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Eccl. viii. 8.</note> GOD does not, in this Part of his Adminiſtration, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by any fixed Rule, diſcoverable by us, or that lie, open to our View; whereby we can know before Hand, the Time, Place, or Circumſtances of our own, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Death.

The Perceptions, Reflections, and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Soul, the ſuperior Part of our Frame, are ſome of them ſuch as clearly in licate its Diſtinction from, its Superiority to, and Independence on the Body, and that it may exiſt ſeparate from, and independant on it: Nor can we, from the Death and Diſſolution of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, certainly infer the Death and Deſtruction of the Soul: On the Contrary, the Capacities and Deſires, the Years, and Hopes of the Soul, ſtrongly argue, not only its Spirituality, but its Immortality too; and that there is a future State, after this which is finiſhed at Death, wherein the Soul ſhall exiſt, and God, the moral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the World, will more fully adminiſter Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to every One, according to his Deeds, than it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears he does in this World, upon the Suppoſition, that this is the only State, in which Men have to live.

               </gap> divine Providence to you, in this Rebuke, which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns you diligently to attend and hearken unto.

And, by the Failure of theſe earthly Streams of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Delight, he directs and leads you to place your Thoughts and Affections upon <hi>Himſelf,</hi> the eternal Source, and unfailing Fountain of all Good and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; to view his endearing Name, and Characters, by which he hath revealed himſelf, with greater Attention and Delight than ever; and to place your ſupreme Truſt and Hope in him, as your beſt Friend, your ſureſt Guide and Comforter, your all-ſufficient Helper and Refuge, and your eternal Portion and Inheritance.</p>
            <p>Moreover, GOD is hereby putting your Love, Duty and Submiſſion to him to the Teſt. He does, as it were, addreſs you, on this trying Occaſion, as our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOR did <hi>Simon Peter, John</hi> xxi. 15. <hi>Loveſt thou me more than theſe?</hi> More than theſe earthly Friends, which I have taken from you?

May you attend to theſe Leſſons of divine Providence, and not be ſo overwhelmed with Grief and Sorrow, as to neglect, or miſimprove theſe Inſtructions: May divine Support, Conſolation, and Inſtruction, be afforded to you, in Proportion to your Trials and Wants: And may you be enabled to endure this <hi>chaſtening,</hi> with ſuch a pious, humble and reſigned Spirit and Behavior, as that <hi>it may yield</hi> unto you <hi>the praceable Fruite of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> and be a happy Means of <hi>working out for you a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory,</hi> in the World of everlaſting Recompence and Reward.</p>
            <p>I would now addreſs myſelf, in a few Words, to this Aſſembly.
