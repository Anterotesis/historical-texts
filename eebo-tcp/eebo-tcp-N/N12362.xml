            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>And thou ſhalt remember all the way which the Lord thy GOD led thee theſe forty years in the wilderneſs, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldeſt keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or no.</p>

            <p>THE hiſtory of the children of Iſrael in Egypt, their ſufferings and oppreſſion under the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Pharaoh, their remarkable deliverance by the hand of Moſes out of that ſtate of bondage and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and their trials and murmurings in the wilderneſs, is well known by thoſe who have been converſant with their bibles, and have attended to thoſe important leſſons contained in the five books of Moſes. But why God thus dealt with that people, perhaps has not been duly attended to by thoſe that have made conſcience of reading the ſacred ſtory. But the text tells us, that it was to humble them, and to prove them, that they might know what was in their hearts, and whether they would keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, or no. All the events which befel them in the way; the miraculous protections, deliverances, proviſions and inſtructions which God gave them, and withal, the frequent and ſevere puniſhments which were inflicted for their diſobedience, was to diſcover to themſelves and others, all that infidelity, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, hypocriſy, apoſtacy, rebellion and perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which lay hid in their hearts; the diſcovery of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015604_0003_0F99D4E0EC89AC20"/>
which was of ſingular uſe both to them, and to the church of God in all ſucceeding ages. For as Watts has it,
<q>
                  <l>There, as in a glaſs our hearts may ſee,</l>
                  <l>How fickle and how falſe they be.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>God, by them, deſigned to let after generations know what was in their hearts; but it is not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known and believed till it comes to the trial; and then it is found that we are prone to act over the ſame ſtupid vile part that the children of Iſrael did in the wilderneſs, under the moſt inſtructive and ſpeaking providences that ever obtained in the world,—So that the notes from the words may be theſe following, namely,</p>
            <p n="1">I. That the hearts of the children of men are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally the ſame from one generation to another.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That God frequently brings his own people into a ſtate of peculiar trials to diſcover to them and others what there is in their hearts.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That people when they are proved and tried, generally ſhew what they are.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The diſcovering to a people their errors and wickedneſs, is deſigned to humble and reform them.</p>
            <p>And then conclude with ſome improvement.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am to ſhew that the hearts of the children of men are naturally the ſame from generation to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.—This is ſo plain a point that I need not ſtand long for the proof of it, tho' it may be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to illuſtrate it by ſome examples; for of one blood God made all nations of men that dwell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the earth, Acts 17, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

of the natural ſtate of the heart ſays, that it is enmity againſt God, not ſubject to his law, neither indeed can be, Rom. 8.7. And our Saviour teſtifieth, That out of the heart of man proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornication, thefts, covetouſneſs, wickedneſs, deceit, laciviouſneſs, an evil eye, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, pride, fooliſhneſs, all theſe things come from within and defile the man. Mark 7 21, 22, 23. And we find this radical evil of the heart early breaking forth and exemplifying itſelf in the lives of all the generations of men that have been upon the earth, from Adam our primogenitor to the preſent race of men that inhabit the earth. Adam was ready to excuſe his ſin by laying it upon Eve, and Eve upon the ſerpent. Gen. 3.12. And we find ſin ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted in the nature of man by the apoſtacy, that thoſe horrid ſins of envy and murder early broke out in the family of Adam; for Cain perceiving that God had not reſpect to his offering as he had to his brother Abel's, was wroth, and his countenance fell, and ſo roſe up againſt his brother and ſlew him. Gen. 4.5. And we don't read far before we find this ſad account, that all fleſh had corrupted their way upon the earth, and that the earth was filled with violence. Gen. 6.11. And we find the moſt ſordid luſts and wickedneſs breaking forth in the people of Sodom. Gen. 19. And the ſins of bribery and oppreſſion early taking place between Jacob and Eſau, the latter being induced by the former to ſell his birth-right for a meſs of pottage. Gen. 25.32. And the ſins of envy and hatred prevailing in the hearts of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of Joſeph, ſo that they could not ſpeak peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to him, but conſpired againſt him to ſlay him. Gen. 27.24. And we find the ſins of pride, tyranny
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015604_0004_0F99D4E1AB5FAB10"/>
and oppreſſion, together with the ſpirit of ſelf-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency and contempt of God and his authority in the haughty tyrant Pharaoh. Exod. 5.2. Who is the Lord, ſays he, that I ſhould obey his voice to let Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Iſrael go. And after all the wonders Moſes wrought, and the judgments againſt Egypt, his heart was ſtill hardened againſt God and would not yield. Exod. 7.8. Shewing that hardneſs of heart was an early ſin; and that people would perſiſt in ſin under ſore corrections and the evident rebukes of Heaven; this was exemplified not only in Pharaoh, but in king Ahaz, who in the time of his diſtreſs did treſpaſs yet more and more againſt the Lord. This is that king Ahaz who is ſo noted for his wickedneſs. 2 Chron. 28.19. And we find this temper not only in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed kings, but in the people of Iſrael under ſore chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements. Jer. 5.3. Thou haſt ſtricken them, but they have not grieved; thou haſt conſumed them, but they have refuſed to receive correction; they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refuſed to return. And Jer. 8.6. No man repented him of his wickedneſs, ſaying, What have I done? every one turned to his courſe as the horſe ruſheth into the battle. They were ſo greedily ſet upon their iniquities, that the prophet compares them to a war horſe that with unbridled force ruſheth into the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Thus greedily did this people ruſh into the ways of ſin. And leſt we ſhould conceive this to be the peculiar wickedneſs of this particular people, he adds in Jer. 17.9. The heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, and who can know it? Tho' we have all the wickedneſs of the world to teach us what there is in our hearts, and our daily experience
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015604_0004_0F99D4E1AB5FAB10"/>
to inſtruct us, yet we do not learn the depths of wickedneſs that lodge in that cavern, till a ſuitable temptation draws it forth into exerciſe. The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael were not aware ('tis like) of the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth part of the wickedneſs that lay lurking in their hearts, while they were in Egypt in that cruel ſtate of bondage to Pharaoh. They were doubtleſs ready then to think, that if they could once get free from that ſtate of vaſſalage, that they would ſerve the Lord with chearfulneſs, and that none of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments ſhould be grievous. But when they came to the trial, they found unbelief, diſtruſt of God and of his tender care of them, ſpringing up in the midſt of the moſt extraordinary manifeſtations of God's power and goodneſs on their behalf, that ever were made to a people. And tho' they had been lately delivered from the ſevereſt bondage and oppreſſion, yet they were as impatient under trials, and as ready to murmur at any difficulties in their way, as tho' they had newly come out of the moſt proſperous ſtate. Now if any one had told them while in their cruel ſtate of bondage, that ſuch were their hearts, they would not have believed them, 'tis like: Therefore God led them thoſe forty years in the wilderneſs to humble and prove them, that they might know what was in their hearts, as 'tis ſaid in the text. And tho' when we read their hiſtory, we are ready to be moved with indignation towards them; yet we are acting over at this day the ſame ſtupid part with them in the wilderneſs. We in this land are, as it were, led out of Egypt by the hand of Moſes; and now we are in the wilderneſs, i. e. in a ſtate of trouble and difficulty; Egyptians purſuing us, to overtake us and reduce us; there is the Red Sea before us, I ſpeak metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015604_0005_0F99D4E29F3ED338"/>
a ſea of blood in your proſpect before you, perhaps; and when you apprehend this in your ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, are you not ready to murmur againſt Moſes and Aaron that led you out of Egypt, and to ſay with the people of Iſrael, It had been better for us to ſerve the Egyptians, than that we ſhould die in the wilderneſs. Exod. 14.12. And tho' God has been pleaſed to work marvellouſly for us at times as he did for them; yet if any new difficulty ariſes, and if things don't go on ſo proſperouſly as at other times, how ſoon does our faith fail us, and we begin to murmur againſt Moſes and Aaron, and wiſh ourſelves back again in Egypt, where we had ſome comforts of life, which we are now deprived of? not conſidering that we choſe our leaders, and that in obtaining any deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance there are great troubles and difficulties gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attending it; neither conſidering that our ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes are owing to the ſins of the people, as was the caſe of the people of Iſrael in the wilderneſs: We find them ten times as ready to find fault with their leaders, and to aſcribe their misfortunes to them, as to recoil in upon themſelves, and to ſay, What have we done? Tho' it was owing entirely to them that they were not delivered. And thus we in this land are murmuring and complaining of our difficulties and ill ſucceſſes at times, thinking our leaders to blame, and the like, not conſidering at the ſame time that we are practiſing thoſe vices that have a natural tendency to deſtroy us, beſides the juſt judgments of Heaven which they tend to draw down upon us as a people: See Iſa. 30.12, 13, which I think aſſigns the moral cauſe of our diſaſterous events. And when we are favoured with a little ſucceſs, we are apt to be elated in our minds like the children of Iſrael after the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015604_0005_0F99D4E29F3ED338"/>
of the Egyptians in the red ſea, and then with them to rejoice, and to encourage ourſelves in the cauſe in which we are engaged; then we can truſt, as we imagine, in God, and hope for his ſalvation and deliverance: But let the ſcale turn a little againſt us, our confidence begins to fail, and we grow diſtruſtful of God and his providence, and begin to murmur and repine.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Thus the faithleſs Jews forgot</l>
               <l>The dreadful wonders God had wrought,</l>
               <l>Then they provoke him to his face,</l>
               <l>Nor fear his power, nor truſt his grace.</l> 
               <bibl>Watts.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>Thus we are acting over the like ſins with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael in the wilderneſs, under the conduct of Moſes and Aaron, who was leading them out of a ſtate of bondage into a land of liberty and plenty in Canaan. Again, we are ready to marvel at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable vileneſs and cruelty of the Britiſh tyrant and his miniſtry, in endeavouring to oppreſs, enſlave and deſtroy theſe American States, who have been ſome of his moſt peaceable and profitable ſubjects; and yet we find the ſame wicked temper and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion operating in Pharaoh king of Egypt above 3000 years ago. See Exod. 1.7 to 17 verſe. When Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael began to increaſe in Egypt, the king ſaid, Come on, let us deal wiſely with them leſt they multiply; and it come to paſs when there falleth out any war, they join unto our enemies and fight againſt us, and ſo get them out of the land; therefore they did ſet over them taſk-maſters to afflict them with their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; they made them to ſerve with rigour, and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, &amp;c. And afterwards they laid the burthen heavier, allowing
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015604_0006_0F99D4EAC0CF0800"/>
them no ſtraw, and yet requiring the full tale of brick. Exod. 5.6—11. And when they endeavoured to make their eſcape from this cruel and oppreſſive ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, Pharaoh purſued after Iſrael with a great army unto the Red Sea. Exod. 14.7—10. So that the Britiſh tyrant is only acting over the ſame wicked and cruel part, that Pharaoh king of Egypt acted towards the children of Iſrael above 3000 years ago. But ſome may be ready to wonder, that ſince we are gone off from Great-Britain, and have declared our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves independent States, and inſiſt upon ſtanding by ourſelves, that they don't let us alone, eſpecially as they have pretended that we are but of little conſequence to Great-Britain. But we find the ſame diſpoſition in the adverſaries of Judah and Benjamin, who troubled them in building, and hired counſellors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them to fruſtrate their purpoſes. Afterwards Rehum the chancellor wrote to the king, The Jews are building the rebellious and bad city; if this city be builded, and the walls ſet up again, ſay they, then they will not pay toll, tribute, &amp;c. and ſo thou ſhalt endamage the revenue of the kings: Now becauſe we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to ſee the king's diſhonour, &amp;c. this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings; and that they have moved ſedition within the ſame of old: if this city be built, by this means thou ſhalt have no portion on this ſide the river, and ſo they haſted to Jeruſalem to ſtay the work by force. Ezr. 4, from the beginning to the 24th verſe. Now this was a right Tory letter and conduct; and Sanballat's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards thoſe that encouraged the work of building the city, was juſt like that of the tories to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that would build up theſe American
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015604_0006_0F99D4EAC0CF0800"/>
States. See Nehem. 2.19. But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the ſervant, the Ammonite, heard it, they laughed us to ſcorn, and deſpiſed us, and ſaid, What is this thing that ye do? Will ye rebel againſt the king? Thus there were ſome men then as well as in theſe days, that ſeemed to look upon it as a greater crime to oppoſe the king in his moſt arbitrary meaſures, than to violate the law of the realm and of their God. And when Sanballat and others heard that the walls of Jeruſalem were made up, they were very wroth, and conſpired all of them together to come and fight againſt Jeruſalem, and to hinder it. Neh. 4.7, 8. And Great-Britain is now acting over juſt the ſame part towards us in theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican States; endeavouring to prevent our build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves up into Free, Independent States; ſo that the temper and diſpoſition of the world has been much the ſame throughout all generations.— Great men are generally proud, ambitious and aſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, diſdainful of inferiors, and apt to reſent the leaſt indignities: We ſee this in Haman, an aſpiring cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, who when he ſaw that Mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence, was full of wrath; wherefore Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſought to deſtroy all the Jews that were thro'out the whole kingdom of Ahaſuerus; and Haman ſaid unto the king, There is a certain people ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and diſperſed among the people in all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of thy kingdom, and their laws are diverſe from all people, neither keep they the king's laws; therefore it is not for the king's profit to ſuffer them; let it pleaſe the king that it may be written that they may be deſtroyed; and I will pay ten thouſand talents of ſilver to the hands of thoſe that have the charge of the buſineſs, to bring it into the king's treaſuries;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015604_0007_0F99D4EC8A8E3D70"/>
and the king grants his deſire. Eſth. 3.5 —11. And the Britiſh miniſtry have been acting over the ſame wicked, miſchievous plot againſt the American States, as Haman did againſt the Jews, and we have reaſon to hope that they will meet with the like fate. But what I mention theſe inſtances for, is to let you ſee that the wickedneſs of man has been much the ſame throughout all ages: We ſee this in David's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. Pſal. 10.8. The wicked in his pride doth perſecute the poor, &amp;c. And Plaſ. 35.20, 25. They deviſe deceitful matters againſt them that are quiet in the land, &amp;c. And Pſal. 94.3, 4, 5. How long ſhall the wicked triumph? Shall they utter and ſpeak hard things: They break in pieces thy people, Oh Lord, and afflict thine heritage, which frame miſchief by a law, &amp;c. From all which paſſages we ſee that our complaints and trials at this day are nothing new: People have been oppreſſed under the colour of law, as we are by the Britiſh miniſtry; and have been moſt cruelly oppreſſed and inſulted by thoſe that have been in power; and have been derided and laughed at by their enemies in their moſt afflicted ſtate.</p>
            <p>I proceed to ſhew,</p>
            <p n="2">II. That God frequently brings his own people into a ſtate of peculiar trials, to diſcover to them and others what there is in their hearts. Thus God tempted Abraham, when he put him upon offering up his ſon Iſaac, Gen. 22.2, 3. (i. e.) tried him with that peculiar trial, that he might diſcover to himſelf and others, what there was in his heart; whether he would keep God's commandments or no, however try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſelf-denying they might be: and the iſſue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to himſelf and to others the firmneſs and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of his principles to the glory of God and his
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015604_0007_0F99D4EC8A8E3D70"/>
own comfort and ſatisfaction; for the trial proved his ſincerity in the cauſe of God, and that he would keep his commandments under the moſt trying circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of obedience, that nothing ſhould deter him from the ſervice of his God, tho' his beſt beloved ſon, as a ſacrifice, ſhould be the teſt of his obedience. Thus nobly did the faith and obedience of this Father of the faithful diſplay itſelf under the exerciſe of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar trials. And as Abraham, ſo Job, was brought into a ſtate of very peculiar trials as a teſt of his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous diſpoſition. God challenges ſatan, the grand tempter, as to the integrity of this man. See Job 2.3. And the Lord ſaid unto ſatan, Haſt thou conſidered my ſervant Job? &amp;c. ſtill he holdeth faſt his integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, altho' thou movedſt me againſt him without a cauſe. And tho' ſatan was not willing to give up the point, but was permitted to proſecute him to the extremity with all his helliſh trials, yet Job reſolved not to let his integrity go as long as he lived; and thereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to the honour of God, and to ſatan's confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the excellency of that principle of which he was poſſeſſed: and as God is thus pleaſed to bring his own people into a ſtate of peculiar trials for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their virtues, ſo likewiſe for the diſcovery of their vices, that they and others may ſee what corruption there ſtill remains in their hearts unmortified and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubdued: Thus good Hezekiah was tried with a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ſcene to diſcover what was in his heart; God gave him a remarkable victory over the Aſſyrians and granted him miraculous reſtoration from a dangerous ſickneſs, and not only ſo, but God gave him peculiar honour by an embaſſy from the great and potent king of Babylon; all which probably raiſed in him too high an opinion of himſelf, as if theſe things were
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015604_0008_0F99D4ECE9C16C30"/>
done, if not by his power, yet at leaſt for his piety and virtues; ſo that inſtead of walking humbly with God, and giving the glory of all intirely to him, he took the honour to himſelf, and vain gloriouſly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his riches and precious treaſures to the Babyloniſh ambaſſadors. 2 Kings 20.12. To this purpoſe it is ſaid, 2 Chron. 32.31. Howbeit in the buſineſs of the ambaſſadors of the princes of Babylon, God left him to try him that he might know all that was in his heart; (i.e.) God withdrew from him thoſe ſupplies and aſſiſtances of his ſpirit, which would have effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally kept him from that ſin, and ſuffered ſatan to tempt him, and him to fall into that ſin of pride and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that Hezekiah might know his own impotency and corruption, his infirmities as well as his virtues, that he might know that the great mercies which he had received, were not the effects of his own merits, as he might be prone to imagine, but of God's free grace. 'Tis likely this king Hezekiah, when he firſt came to the throne, and was ſo zealous for deſtroying all the idolatry of the land, and ſetting up the pure worſhip of God in his kingdom, was not then aware that there was ſuch wickedneſs in his heart, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he found when he came to be tried with a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ſcene; but when the warm ſunſhire of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity came over him, the putrid matter that lay in his heart, began to operate and ſtench forth: And ſo a ſuitable temptation will frequently draw forth ſuch corruptions into exerciſe, as perſons before were not aware of being in their hearts. This we ſee in a ſtriking light in Hazael, whom the prophet informed how wicked and cruel he would be when he came to be king, viz. that he would burn their ſtrong holds, and ſtay their young men with the ſword, daſh their
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015604_0008_0F99D4ECE9C16C30"/>
children, and rip up their women with child, &amp;c. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zael when he came to hear the diſcription, was ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it, and reſented the thought, as you ſee from his reply. 2 Kings 8.13. And Hazael ſaid, But what is thy ſervant a dog, that he ſhould do this great thing? And yet we find, as a worthy author obſerves upon this paſſage, that the dog did it. He could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that there was ſuch cruelty and barbarity in his heart as to practiſe ſuch inhumanity as the prophet pointed out: But when he came to the trial, and was made king, and felt the pleaſing power of having the world under him, as it were, then pride, inſolence, and a tyrannical diſpoſition ſprung up in his heart, like noxious and baleful weeds in an overfattened ſoil, to the deſtruction of the deſign of regal dignity, whereby he became a curſe and deſtroyer of his people, rather than a miniſter of God for good unto them. But he was not aware, it ſeems, when the prophet told him that he ſhould be king of Syria, that he ſhould ever be left to practiſe ſuch inhumanity and barbarity as afterwards he was guilty of: Neither is it probable that George the third, when he firſt came to the throne of Great-Britain, and ſwore to govern according to the good and wholeſome laws of the realm, and iſſued that ſerious proclamation for the ſuppreſſion of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities, would in a few years by a royal edict, butcher a great number of his beſt ſubjects for not ſubmitting to his arbitrary mandates. Doubtleſs when he firſt came to the throne, if it had been ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to him, that he would have practiſed all that tyranny, cruelty, and oppreſſion which he has not long ſince gone into, with regard to the American States, he would have been ready to have replied in indignation with Hazael, Is thy ſervant a dog that he
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015604_0009_0F99D4EDA8D9BF98"/>
ſhould do this great thing? But we find he has done it to our grievous wounding, and to his diſhonour and bloody guilt! He that ſhould have been our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and protector, has become the bloody murderer of thouſands of his beſt ſubjects! And tho' this ſeems harſh to aſſert with regard to one whom we have heretofore addreſſed with the kind and honorary epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet of a gracious ſovereign, yet I now boldly aſſert him to be a cruel tyrant, who ſeeks to govern us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out law, without reaſon, or the ſacred dictates of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; impiouſly declaring that he has a right to give us laws binding in all caſes whatſoever. If ſuch a prince is not a tyrant, I know not who deſerves the name! But he is only with that dog Hazael, acting out the cruelty of his heart and that of his bloody court. The ſeven abominations that have lain hid there, have now come forth like the locuſts from the bottomleſs pit upon this land to diſtreſs and annoy it; burning and laying waſte populous towns that were erected without any of his expence or patronage; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying fire and ſword among thoſe who have been his moſt peaceable and faithful ſubjects; raviſhing the women where the armies have marched; exerciſing the greateſt inhumanity and barbarity towards their priſoners; freezing and ſtarving them to death, &amp;c. and all this done by Britiſh troops, who uſed to be famed for their humanity and generoſity to priſoners! Who would have thought that ſuch ſavage cruelty had been in their hearts? But the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> has brought it out to the diſgrace of the Britiſh tyrant and his bloody troops. Some are diſpoſed, 'tis true, to talk much of the mercy and mildneſs of Britiſh government, to encourage people to ſubmit to their lawleſs claims; but I am never diſpoſed to look to that power for
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015604_0009_0F99D4EDA8D9BF98"/>
mercy, that is devoid of juſtice, but forever reject the cruel wretch, who for the ſake of a lawleſs domination, would ſacrifice almoſt one quarter of the globe to his reſentment. I think the trial has diſcovered what is in the heart of Britiſh adminiſtration, and I never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be again connected with that government, which inſtead of ſpeaking peace to us, and to our ſeed, threatens death and deſtruction to us and our poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp;c. But as the trial has diſcovered what is in the heart of Britiſh adminiſtration, ſo likewiſe the peculiar ſituation that the American States have been in, have tried what is in our hearts; as the American Criſis obſerves, Theſe are times that try men's ſouls; and many things are diſcovered in the trial, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might have lain concealed in the heart; tho' as our Saviour obſerves, Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh; yet ſome will conceal what is within, till a proper temptation draw it forth. The conteſt has been, whether we ſhould ſubmit to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, oppreſſive claims of Britiſh adminiſtration, or maintain our own rights, and repel force by force: vaſtly the greateſt majority has been for the latter; and the general will is always ſaid to be of the nature of a law; a ſmall part of the States have oppoſed the general will, and have openly taken part with Britiſh adminiſtration: others have been more reſerved, and have waited to ſee which is the ſafeſt ſide, in order to determine their conduct. Theſe are men of no prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, only to ſave themſelves, which is the moſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did of all; for they will be on this ſide or the other, juſt as the ſcale is like to turn, for or againſt the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Now theſe are trying times to ſift men out, that they and others may know what is in their hearts; whether they will ſell their country and their God for
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015604_0010_0F99D4EE690B9568"/>
a little worldly pelf; or whether they will make a noble ſacrifice of all their worldly goods, and even bleed and die for their dear country, and dear bought privileges: many have done it already, and many more ſeem ready to do it, whoſe names ought to be honoured and held dear in the annals of the American States, ſo long as there are any to remember their deeds. But this will not be the fame of all that had their birth and education in this noble land! No, it will be ſaid to the eternal diſgrace of ſome, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſtanding for the precious land of their nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and its dear bought privileges, that they vilely betrayed it; and with Eſau they ſold their birth-right for a meſs of pottage; that they turned their ſword, which ſhould have been drawn in the defence of their country, againſt the father that begat them, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the tender bowels of the mother that bare them, and the loving brothers and ſiſters that ſolaced them, and all the dear friends and neighbours that uſed to aid and aſſiſt them! Oh, this is an image too horrid and ſhocking to look to! I turn from it as a picture too monſtrous to behold! and turn to one of a more diminutive ſize, tho' not much leſs deſpicable than the former; and that is ſuch as aim not to uſe the ſword upon either ſide, but aim to take a part upon that ſide that will beſt ſecure their darling intereſt; their ſouls are ſo immerſed in ſilver and gold, that they would fall into that ſcale which would weigh down with the moſt penny weight! Theſe are they that make gold their hope, and the fine gold their confidence, and deny the God that is above, as Job elegantly expreſſes it; Job 31.24. (i. e.) His provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that can eaſily diſappoint them in their hope and confidence: Such perſons truſt that their money
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015604_0010_0F99D4EE690B9568"/>
and intereſt will ſecure them from diſtreſſes and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and therefore greedily procure it, and then are ready to join with that party which they think are like to conquer; not conſidering that the events of war are altogether uncertain, and that that ſide which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the moſt promiſing at preſent, may be in a few days the moſt gloomy and threatening —'tis not worth while under the moſt promiſing proſpects, to ſay with David, My mountain ſtands ſo ſtrong that I ſhall not be moved; for God may hide his face as he did from him, and then with him we ſhall ſoon be troubled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But then we ſhould always act upon principle, and be uniform in our conduct, committing our cauſe to God, who ſits in the throne judging righteouſly, and can ſave and deliver with few or with many. But ſome people have no notion about truſting in God; they riſe and fall juſt like a ſhip at anchor with the ebbing and flowing tide. And theſe trying times are deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhew us what is in our hearts; whether we will truſt in him at all times, and adhere to the cauſe which we profeſs to believe to be right in dark and gloomy days, as well as in thoſe that are more fair and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous. It is no great matter for men to truſt in God, when every thing looks fair and proſperous; they then deceive themſelves, thinking they truſt in God, whereas they truſt in the fair proſpect that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. But this is the trial of our ſincerity, when every thing looks dark and gloomy, according to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man proſpects, then to commit our cauſe to God, and truſt in him for a favourable iſſue: This is truly truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God. And theſe ſhifting ſcenes of adverſe and proſperous appearances, are deſigned to humble us and prove us, that we may know what is in our hearts. There is a variety of temptations ariſing from our
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015604_0011_0F99D4F2DFFF3150"/>
particular ſtate and circumſtances, to draw out what there is in our hearts: There are many things to try us, whether we are of a public ſpirit; whether we regard our country, our liberties and privileges more than our own private pelf; and ſome we ſhall find ſhrinking back from the public cauſe, avoiding all occaſions in which the public calls for aſſiſtance, while others leſs able muſt bear the weight of the public weal or let it ſink. Others are tried as to their huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and benevolence, whether they will aſſiſt others with the neceſſary ſupports of life, when they can do it, at a reaſonable lay: And here, alas! we find the trial betraying what is in the hearts of many, even a wicked, oppreſſive diſpoſition, refuſing to part with their proviſion at that high price allowed and ſtated by the legiſlature of the ſtate; waiting, it ſeems, to take the advantage of people's neceſſities, to get a more exorbitant price. This is a wickedneſs prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the country which we ſhould not have imagined to have been in their hearts, had not the trial brought it forth. And God is trying us and proving us by all the variety of his diſpenſations, that we may know what is in our hearts, and whether we will keep his commandments or no; whether the ſabbath-profaner will become a ſabbath ſanctifier; whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane ſwearer will bridle his tongue, and leave off his profaneneſs; whether the wanton and intemperate will become chaſte and ſober; and whether people will reform their ways, mortify their corruptions, and become new creatures. The land have ſadly corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their way; religion has been loſing ground for many years; and all manner of vice and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has become rampant in the land; and God is viſiting us for theſe things with general judgments;
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015604_0011_0F99D4F2DFFF3150"/>
and 'tis likely God will keep us in this wilderneſs of trouble to humble us and prove us, that we may ſee our errors, and know that God has a righteous contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy with us at this day. We are apt to think that our cauſe is ſo righteous with regard to Great-Britain, that I fear we are ready to forget our unrighteouſneſs towards God; and while we are endeavouring to get rid of the unreaſonable commands of an earthly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, I fear we forget to obey the moſt reaſonable commands of the rightful Sovereign of the Univerſe. Let us look upon the ground on which we ſtand; conſider our guilt and danger, and be humble for our ſins, and under all the tokens of God's diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us on the account of our ſins, repent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form whatſoever is amiſs in the midſt of us, that we may be prepared for a deliverance out of our troubles; that being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we may ſerve God without fear in righteouſneſs and true holineſs all the days of our lives.</p>
            <p>I proceed to ſhew,</p>
            <p n="3">III. That people when they are proved and tried, generally ſhew what they are: A ſuitable trial gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſhews what people are, whether virtuous or vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; if they are of a virtuous diſpoſition, a ſuitable trial will generally bring out their virtues to public view; and if vicious, their vices. We have been ready to look upon ourſelves as a virtuous people in this land, to be ſure in compariſon with Great-Britain, and ſo to encourage ourſelves that we ſhould not be vanquiſhed on account of our virtues: But the trial diſcovers that there is not ſo much virtue in the land as we were ready to imagine; there is a vaſt deal of wickedneſs brought out to public view in this day of trial; many we find will betray their dear bought
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015604_0012_0F99D4F47811C280"/>
country for a little worldly pelf, preferring their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent intereſt, eaſe and advantage, to all the liberties and privileges of their future poſterity: And many who aim not to betray their country, are ſo mercenary that they would imbark on that ſide that they think would beſt ſave their intereſt, without any regard to the righteouſneſs of the cauſe. And others who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be zealous in the cauſe of their country, are ſo fond of making a fortune, as we ſay, or of advancing their intereſt, that they become blind to the bleeding wounds of their country, and deaf to the cries of the poor and needy, and will not reach forth the helping hand to their diſtreſſes, unleſs with the iron hand of oppreſſion to extort an exorbitant ſum for their relief: Indeed the trial ſhews that there is but little of a public ſpirit prevailing amongſt people in general at this day; the bigger part ſeem exceedingly ſelfiſh, ſtriving for the higheſt price for every article that they have to part with; and if they think there is a proſpect of its arriving to a more extravagant price thro' the exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the country, they will withhold it from the needy, tho' the ſtone ſhould cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber ſhould anſwer it. Hab. 2.11. So that the ſin of oppreſſion ſeems to be as ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant in the land as it was in Jeruſalem, which was ſtiled wholly oppreſſion. I am ſorry to have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to obſerve, that our trials have brought forth this wickedneſs to open view in the midſt of us, eſpecially as this is the crime that we are complaining of and ſtruggling againſt in Britiſh adminiſtration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but doubtleſs this is to humble us and prove us, that we may know what there is in our hearts. If this diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition had not appeared upon the trial, we ſhould have been ſelf-righteous and truſted in ourſelves; and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015604_0012_0F99D4F47811C280"/>
have been ready to have thought if we had any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, this was owing to our being more righteous than Great-Britain, and ſo arrogated the glory to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But God has been pleaſed to bring the people of this land into this trying ſituation, wherein they could take the advantage of getting an extravagant price for the neceſſaries of life; and upon trial they found it in their hearts to take the advantage and to oppreſs; ſo that if we have any mercy ſhewn us, we may know that it is not for our ſakes: Agreeable to that, Ezek. 36.32. Not for your ſakes do I this, ſaith the Lord God, be it known unto you; be aſhamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded for your own ways, Oh houſe of Iſrael! But then oppreſſion is not the only ſin that our trials have brought forth to view, but the ſins of treachery, falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and deceit have crept out in one place and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thro' the land, in divers perſons who would betray its ſacred cauſe into the hands of tyranny and oppreſſion: And others under the notion of being high ſons of liberty, will act without law and above law, and ſo encourage and promote univerſal tyranny under the notion of a plenitude of liberty; for to govern without law is tyranny: for law is the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of liberty; ſecuring a people in their rights and liberties; and whoſoever endeavours to ſet law aſide or to ſuperſede it, ſo far endeavours to deſtroy the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of his country, and ſo far to promote a tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal government. And yet the trying ſituation of the country has diſcovered ſome to be of this complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and however high they may think themſelves for liberty, they are throwing down the very bulwark that ſecures it. But the trial diſcovers another ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who tho' they are not for going againſt law, yet they are not for putting the laws in execution, which

enervates government, and renders the law of no force; and ſuch, however well meaning they may have been, have inadvertently fallen into an opinion that has proved very hurtful to the country; for the relaxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the laws has encouraged ſome to act out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the diſadvantage of the country; the civil ſword has not been a terror to evil doers as heretofore, and a praiſe and protection to ſuch as do well; and the debtor has ſhewn the diſhoneſty of his heart in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to pay his honeſt dues, becauſe courts of judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature have not been kept up in times back, to oblige him to do this juſtice; and men have hereby been defrauded of their honeſt dues. And this is not the greateſt evil; for this has laid the foundation for the moſt of that oppreſſion that there is in the midſt of us; for the country finding themſelves not obliged to part with their monies, feel not the neceſſity of parting with their proviſion, and ſo withhold it from the conſumer till an extortionate price draws it out of their hands. This is a diſpoſition which we ſhould not have thought to have been ſo prevalent in the land, if the unhappy trial had not brought it forth: but we ſee and feel it to our diſtreſs and confuſion; ſo that it appears that we have much leſs public virtue in the country than we were aware of; many being diſpoſed to take the advantage of the diſtreſſes of their country, not caring who ſinks if they can but ſwim; ſome ſelling their country under the notion of advancing their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and others oppreſſing their country in order to make an eſtate; and this diſeaſe has took place not only among the trading part, but has ſeized as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently upon the farmer and the tradeſman as upon the former, and threatens the death and ruin of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, more than all the formidable force of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015604_0013_0F99D4F6522BA068"/>
and the whole tory faction in the land: and yet theſe would be thought to be friends to their country and conſcientious people. Thus the god of this world blinds the eyes of men; if they were not deluded by the devil and the deceitfulneſs of their own wicked hearts, they could no more think themſelves conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and friends to their country, than the thief and the high-way man; for oppreſſion is as much ſpoken againſt in ſcripture, as the forementioned vices, and has as direct a tendency to ruin the country; for theſe things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of diſobedience. And when there is the oppreſſion of the poor, and the ſighing of the needy in the midſt of us, we can't expect any other, but God will ariſe to judgment, and make his plagues dreadful upon this land. We have been ready to wonder that Britiſh troops ſhould be ſo oppreſſive and cruel to our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but it has been obſerved by ſome worthy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, that God is wont to puniſh people frequently with ſuch a kind of puniſhment as beſpeaks the nature of their crimes: And our Saviour tells us, that ſuch meaſure as you mete, ſhall be meaſured to you again. Mat. 7.2. And we have reaſon to believe that God thus permits us to be oppreſſed by the Britiſh troops, as a righteous correction for the oppreſſive diſpoſition that prevails in this land. We were not aware that there was ſuch a diſpoſition prevailing till the trial brought it out. Trade uſed to regulate itſelf; and in our peaceable ſtate, when courts of judicature were kept up, and the laws of the State put into execution, things went on regularly, one thing anſwered another, and there was a conſiderable equality in our dealings one with another; ſo that the poor were not oppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the conſumer in general, could purchaſe the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015604_0014_0F99D4F6AE4D9F58"/>
neceſſaries and even the ſuperfluities of life at a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lay: But trade ſtopping, it naturally made the ſuperfluities and ſome of the neceſſaries of life ſcarce and dear; and the war naturally made the circulating medium plenty, ſo that we might have grappled with the dearneſs of thoſe articles, they being few, and many of them non-neceſſaries, if it had not fell upon the neceſſaries of life. It is true the farmer and tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man reſented the high price upon thoſe foreign im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and called it oppreſſion, and were for making an inſurrection, to ſeize their ſtores at what they called a reaſonable price; and doubtleſs there was oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the trading part of the country with regard to their foreign imports; but no ways equal to what there is now among the farmers and tradeſmen: It is like the farmer and tradeſmen then were not aware that they had the ſame oppreſſive temper and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the merchant; but the trial has brought it out to our humiliation and wounding; Providence has put them under ſuch circumſtances that they can take the advantage of the times, and they find an heart to improve it to as much rapacity and oppreſſion, as ever the merchant improved it: refuſing to part with their grain at almoſt any price, tho' Heaven has been ſo bountiful in granting them ſo plentiful a harveſt: they have the cries of the poor and needy againſt them, and they have reaſon to fear the curſe that is denounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt him that withholdeth corn from the people. Prov. 11.26. And in diſcourſe with them upon the affair, they will ſay, Oh, I ſhould be willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the ancient price if I could have ſalt, or ſome particular articles that have got very high, at the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient price; making the extravagant article the rule for the common productions of the land; and ſo they
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015604_0014_0F99D4F6AE4D9F58"/>
oppreſs an hundred becauſe they are oppreſſed in ſome one particular article; But they will reply and ſay, Paper money is not ſo good as it uſed to be: But I query why? If you have owed one hundred pound to a man, will not an hundred pound in paper currency pay it, as well as ten years ago? Yes, you will ſay, perhaps, but I can't buy ſo much with it, as I could ſome years back, eſpecially of ſome articles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not ſo good. To which I reply, according to this, money will always ſink, when ſome particular article gets to be higher than uſual; according to this, ſilver and gold may ſink as well as our paper currency. You can't buy ſo much proviſion and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in the city of New-York now, by one third, with ſilver and gold, as you could a year or two back, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt accounts; yet we don't ſay that ſilver and gold is ſunk becauſe of that; but that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is ſcarce there and of more eſtimation there in compariſon with ſilver and gold, than uſual: But that is no reaſon why every mechanic there ſhould riſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the price of his labour. Sometimes one thing is ſcarce and ſometimes another, ſo that we ſhould mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually bear theſe inconveniences; But becauſe one thing is dear, to make every thing ſo, is the way to kill and oppreſs the poor, and the many that have to buy every thing: So that the way that the country has precipitately run into, is not only vaſtly impolitic, but very wicked and oppreſſive, and forebodes darker things to this land than any thing beſides, according to my apprehenſion: And this avaricious and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive humour breaks out in ſo many ways and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that it is enough to confound and aſtoniſh any conſiderate perſon that attends to it, and makes him fear the worſt. But beſides, the trial has brought out many other vices, which we ſhould have hoped
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015604_0015_0F99D4F77AD802B8"/>
were not ſo predominant in the land, if the trial had not diſcovered them. To inſtance in a few; the little regard that is ſhewn to the ſabbath by the ſoldiery and others, who look upon themſelves a little at liberty from the reſtraints of human laws; and that profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that there is in our armies, raiſed from the midſt of us for the defence of our dear land, as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt people at home, at a time in which the land is involved in the greateſt diſtreſſes that ever it knew; and when there has been the moſt expreſs prohibitions againſt profane ſwearing, iſſued from the higheſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in America. This profaneneſs, I ſay, is very ſurprizing under theſe extraordinary circumſtances, and which we ſhould not have thought to have been in our hearts if the trial had not brought it forth. We uſed to think ſtrange of Britiſh troops, that they would be ſo profane in times of imminent danger; but we have reaſon now to turn the aſtoniſhment upon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to be ſenſible that we have hearts as bad as they, and without the reſtraints of divine grace we ſhall act as ſtupid and vile a part as the vileſt of them: And not only this wickedneſs has diſcovered itſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trial, but a ſtrange ſpirit of falſhood has gone forth into the land, ſo that it is very difficult to aſcertain facts of the moſt intereſting nature as to our military operations; beſpeaking the want of a ſpirit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and uprightneſs in the land; all which forebode ill concerning us as a people; for if public virtue fails, and people grow vicious and profane, ſelfiſh and oppreſſive under the ſoreſt judgments and calamities, we have reaſon to fear the worſt; that God will mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply our diſtreſſes and increaſe his judgments, till we are brought to a repentance and reformation. We ſee that God kept the children of Iſrael in the wilderneſs for many years after he had delivered them from the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:015604_0015_0F99D4F77AD802B8"/>
hand of Pharaoh, on the account of their wickedneſs; and he led them ſo long in the wilderneſs to humble and prove them that they might know what there was in their hearts; and one trial after another brought it out. And ſo our trials in this wilderneſs ſtate are bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out our corruptions one after another, that we and others may know what there is in our hearts; what pride, what ſelfiſhneſs, what covetouſneſs, what ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, rebellion, impatience and diſtruſt of God and his providence, all theſe come flowing forth from the midſt of us under our trials, in as conſpicuous a manner as they did from the children of Iſrael in the wilderneſs; which if it had not been for our trials, that have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered them, we ſhould not have imagined to have been in ſuch a privileged, goſpelized land as this.</p>
            <p>Which brings me to ſhow,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That the diſcovering to a people their errors and wickedneſs is deſigned to humble and reform them. This is ſpoken of as being the expreſs end and deſign of bringing the children of Iſrael into the wilderneſs, and leading them there forty years, it was to humble them and prove them, that they might know what there was in their hearts, and whether they would keep his commandments or no. God did it not merely to bring out ſuch a deformed character to view, as they exhibit under their trials; but that being brought forth, they might ſee their own wickedneſs and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and be humbled and repent of this their great wickedneſs and reform their lives, by keeping his commandments for the future. And this is the end and deſign of God in bringing us into this wilderneſs of trouble and confuſion, that we may know what there is in our hearts, that being brought out to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic view, we and others may ſee what a wicked people we are, and that we may be deeply humbled and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:015604_0016_0F99D4F828BDCB58"/>
before God on the ſame account, repent and reform. 'Tis not becauſe God delights in bringing ſuch a deformed character to view; no, for it is more odious and irkſome to him, for he hateth all the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of iniquity, and he is of purer eyes than to behold evil, and cannot look on iniquity. Hab. 1.13. A vicious character is like a noiſom ſtench in his noſtrils; and therefore when God brings ſuch a character into view, it is that we may ſee the deformity and vileneſs of it, and that we may be humbled under it, repent and reform. Therefore let us be ſollicitous to get a clear view of our manifold guilt, and to be deeply humbled on the account of our own ſins, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold high handed abominations that are daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in this diſtinguiſhed land of light and liberty: That there is ſo much of a diſpoſition in the midſt of us to oppreſs one another, while the land is wading in blood to oppoſe and reſiſt this wickedneſs in Britiſh adminiſtration. Oh, let us ſee the deformity of this vice thro' the bloody ſpectacles of thoſe parliamentary acts, that declare that they have a right to tax the American States, and to give laws to us in all caſes whatſoever; and in conſequence of ſuch a claim have ſent their bloody troops to butcher us, till we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſuch a cruel yoke of tyranny and oppreſſion: Methinks this ſhocking ſcene of oppreſſion is enough to give you to ſee the deformity of this vice, and to make you flee from it as a monſter that devours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pity! And if you do not ſee it in this horrid pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, look into hell—and there ſee Dives roaring in the fire of hell for a drop of water to cool his torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tongue, for denying the crumbs that he had to ſpare from his own table, to a poor, periſhing Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus! Methinks if people would look a little upon this oppreſſive wretch in hell, weltering and gaſping for a
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:015604_0016_0F99D4F828BDCB58"/>
drop of water, who the other day, could ſwim in wine and all the delicacies of life, and was for pulling down his barns and building greater to ſtow his grain in: I ſay, if they would look a little at him, methinks it would cure them of their oppreſſive diſpoſition, and open their ſtores and their hearts to the poor and needy, leſt as they have refuſed to ſhew mercy, ſo mercy ſhould be denied to them another day. In ſhort, any vice viewed in its deformity and deſtructive nature and tendency, is enough to ſhock the hardieſt wretch on earth, and make him fly from it with as great precipitancy as Amnon's brethren did from the feaſt of wine, when they ſaw their brother ſlain there. 2 Sam. 13.29. Every ſin is of a deſtructive, deadly nature; and if ſin was thus ſeen and viewed, it would not be ſo difficult to diſſuade people from it; but they view it thro' the devil's ſpectacles, which makes it to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more delighting and contenting than ever it is found to be; and he blinds their minds as to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and deſtructive nature of it, ſo that he may lead them blindfold down to eternal perdition: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had need take much pains to bring ſinners to a juſt view of their ſins; for till then they will not be humbled for them, nor repent and reform. And hence it is that God brings people into ſome trying ſituation to bring their wickedneſs out to view, that they may know what there is in their hearts and be humbled for it; and the trials that we have been under in this land, have brought out a vaſt deal of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which we ſhould not have been aware of, if the trial had not betrayed it. And what is the end of this diſcovery? Why to humble us, and to bring us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and a general reformation. Let us then be ſenſible of the ends of Divine Providence in permitting ſuch wickedneſs to break out in the midſt of us; it
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:015604_0017_0F99D4F9189E3F00"/>
is to humble us and to give us to ſee that we have no cauſe to truſt in ourſelves,—in our own righteouſneſs, which we are very prone to, that diſclaiming all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in ourſelves, we may truſt in him who raiſeth the dead,—and who will have mercy on whom he will have mercy.</p>
            <p>Several uſeful inferences might be made from this ſubject, but I ſhall confine myſelf to one, with which I ſhall conclude the diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Seeing it is as we have heard, that the wickedneſs of man has been much the ſame thro' all generations, hence we may infer, that every generation may rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally expect the like puniſhments and calamities that have been inflicted upon generations back. The hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the world is nothing ſcarcely but a hiſtory of the wickedneſs and miſeries of it. Take the ſacred hiſtory from the fall of man till Chriſt's appearance on earth, till his crucifixion, reſurrection and aſcenſion to glory, and even from the miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, till the completion of the ſacred canon, and what do we find but the wickedneſs of man acted forth in a variety of ſhapes, together with the juſt judgments of God purſuing it with a variety of calamities thro' life, till death ſwallows them up in one undiſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ruin! This is the general, melancholy account of the human race as fallen! Then have we reaſon to look upon it as ſtrange that we ſee and feel the like diſtreſſes and calamities with the world that has gone before us? Surely no. When we read in ſacred or profane hiſtory of the unnatural wars that have ariſen among thoſe of the ſame nation, people and language, we are ready to be ſhock'd at the horrid ſcene, and to marvel at the outrage, cruelty and devaſtation that they will make of one another in ſuch a conteſt! But if God did not reſtrain the wrath and wickedneſs of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:015604_0017_0F99D4F9189E3F00"/>
mankind, they would always be acting over the horrid ſcene, biting and devouring one another! And the wickedneſs of the Britiſh nation, I mean of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning part of them, has arrived to that pitch, that they are diſpoſed to act over all that wickedneſs, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and oppreſſion that Pharaoh and the other cruel tyrants of the earth have been diſpoſed to practiſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe in their power: Witneſs the cruel and unnatural war that they have levied againſt us; burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and laying waſte many noble towns with a ſavage barbarity and wantonneſs of rage; abuſing the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners that have fallen into their hands, with worſe than ſavage barbarity! freezing and ſtarving them to death with a relentleſs cruelty! ſo that the cries of thoſe poor oppreſſed priſoners have entered I truſt, into the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth, and that he has ariſen to avenge their blood upon thoſe inhumane butchers, who have come above 3000 miles to deſtroy their neighbours that are more righteous than they! This is the nation that heretofore has been famed for their humanity and generoſity to their enemies, eſpecially when priſoners, that have now ſunk into ſuch a degree of cruelty and barbariſm, that they can abuſe them after they have ſurrendered, cane them, ſtrip them of their clothing, and then drive them like a flock of ſheep into priſon, and there freeze and ſtarve them to death! Oh how is the nation fallen and debaſed by the moſt ſordid wickedneſs and inhumanity! and from once being famed for chriſtianity, their conduct would diſgrace the moſt barbarous nation on earth! Thus the wickedneſs of the human heart, without the reſtraints of divine grace will act out a part not much inferior in vileneſs to that of infernals! But then tho' I thus inveigh againſt the cruelty and wickedneſs of Britiſh adminiſtration and their ſordid troops; yet I would by no means inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:015604_0018_0F99D5002B9EBF80"/>
that we are innocent, and free from wickedneſs; no, God has a righteous controverſy with us in this land; and our iniquities have arrived to that aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted height, that they have called for theſe ſore calamities that we feel! and the Britiſh nation are the rod of God's anger to ſcourge and chaſtiſe us for our ſins, as the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian monarch was to God's people of old. See Iſa. 10.5, 6, 7. Oh Aſſyrian the rod of mine anger, and the ſtaff in their hand is mine indignation! I will ſend him againſt an hypocritical nation, and againſt the people of my wrath will I give him a charge to take the ſpoil, and to take the prey and to tread them down as the mire of the ſtreets; howbeit, he meaneth not ſo, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth his heart think ſo, but it is in his heart to deſtroy and cut off nations not a few, &amp;c. Tho' this haughty tyrant had no deſign of executing God's will and the glory of his juſtice in puniſhing an hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal people, but only to enlarge his own empire and ſatisfy his own luſts, by ſacrificing multitudes of people to his own ambition and covetouſneſs; yet God meant to uſe him as a rod, and the inſtrument of his anger to chaſtiſe and correct his ſinful, degenerate, backſliding people; and we have reaſon to think, (let the deſigns of the Britiſh tyrant be what they will) that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns him as the rod of his anger to correct us for the foul ſins and abominations of this highly privileged land! Therefore let us be humble, kiſs the rod and accept the puniſhment of our ſins,—repent and turn to God by an univerſal reformation,—that God may be intreated for the land, ſpare his heritage, and not give it up to a reproach,—but reſtore to us our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as at the firſt, and our privileges as at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. AMEN.</p>
