            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN IMPARTIAL REVIEW, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE circumſtances on which Dr. Ruſh founds his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Contagious Yellow Fever which prevailed in Philadelphia from the beginning of Auguſt to November, in the year 1793, he tells us, are theſe, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> "A quantity of damaged coffee was expoſed on the 24th of July, in a ſituation, on a wharf and in a dock, which favoured its putrefaction and exhalation, in conſequence of which its ſmell was highly putrid and offenſive to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants who reſided in the neighbourhood of that wharf." And</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> "The Yellow Fever in the Weſt Indies, and in all other counties where it is endemic, is the offspring of vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble putrefaction. And as the ſame cauſes under like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances muſt always produce the ſame effects, ſimilar degrees of heat acting upon dead and moiſt vegetable matters are capable of producing it, together with all its various modifications, in every part of the world."</p>
            <p>In ſupport of this opinion he has employed ſome authorities, and a multitude of very ingenious and highly laboured argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of entering into a formal refutation of theſe, I ſhall content myſelf with oppoſing a few authorities to thoſe which he has quoted reſpecting the opinion of the Yellow Fever being the offspring of vegetable putrefaction, and inſtead of replying methodically to all his arguments, ſhall ſhew "how a plain tale will ſet him down."</p>
            <p>The obſervations of the generality of the Weſt India writers have been ſo imperfect and inaccurate, that they did not even ſuſpect the diſeaſe of being contagious, and inſtead of aſcribing it to the exhalations from putrid vegetable ſubſtances they ſay,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:026836_0003_0FD190D2F7B17240"/>
it is occaſioned by ſome irregularity in ſome of the non natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals in conjunction with the heat of the climate.—Even Lind, who is quoted by Dr. Ruſh in ſupport of his opinion, makes no mention of its being derived from vegetable putrefaction; all he ſays is, that "in general it proceeds from intenſe heat and a peculiar unhealthfulneſs of the air: But what gives riſe to that unhealthfulneſs of the air, he has not ſaid <note n="*" place="bottom">Diſeaſes of hot climates, 5th Edition, page 119.</note>.</p>
            <p>It cannot be inferred that the Fever is the offspring of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table putrefaction from what is ſaid by Dr. Lind at page 179, reſpecting the greater mortality of patients with the Yellow Fever at Greenwich Hoſpital in Jamaica, which was ſituated in a low, damp, unwholeſome place, but only implies that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome air aggravated the ſymptoms of the diſeaſe, which we know to be the caſe in all other fevers.</p>
            <p>The ſupport, Dr Ruſh ſuppoſed his opinion had received from Dr. Miller's account of the <hi>bilious colic</hi> which prevailed at Dover from vegetable putrefaction, muſt fall to the ground, when the reader is aſſured, that the caſes of colic which were ſuppoſed to have ariſen from that cauſe, have ſince been proved by Dr. Sykes to have ariſen from the uſe of bark adulterated with litharge, as I can make appear from a letter now in my poſſeſſion from Dr. Sykes, dated at Dover the 29th of May laſt.</p>
            <p>That Dr. Lind, as well as Sir John Pringle, ſhould have miſtaken the nature and cauſes of this fever, is by no means ſurpriſing; ſince neither of them ever had an opportunity of ſeeing a caſe of it, and as they did not know or even ſuſpect the diſeaſe to be contagious, and believed that every other kind of contagious fever was derived from dead and putrid animal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and had very vague and imperfect ideas of the nature of contagion and its cauſes, their authority on the preſent queſtion ought not to be admitted.</p>
            <p>Even Dr. Cullen, forming his opinion upon the report of others, has miſtaken the nature of the diſeaſe, and claſſed it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, amongſt putrid diſeaſes; whereas not only the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, but every diſſection which has been made, demonſtrate the diſeaſe to be ſpecifically different from both the bilious, and the putrid fever<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Davidſon ſays that when there was a vomitting of bile, the patient recovered.</note>. Inſtead of a redundancy of bile excreted at the beginning, which is one of the pathognomonic ſigns of a bilious fever, there was a deficiency of that fluid, as is well
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:026836_0004_0FD1E1D4B1C885A8"/>
known to every practitioner in this city, and that the principal affection was an inflammation of the ſtomach and parts adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, requiring a treatment ſimilar to other inflammatory local affections, connected with idiopathic fever, not only the ſucceſs of the treatment but every diſſection ſufficiently proves. If the diſeaſe was neither a bilious nor a putrid fever, but a ſynochus or an inflammatory fever at the beginning, and putrid before its termination, when it proved mortal, inſtead of aſcribing it to the exhalations from putrid vegetables, common ſenſe would dictate, as well as analogy direct us to aſcribe it to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific contagion, as Dr. Mitchel did when it occurred in Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</p>
            <p>The effects of putrefaction upon coffee as well as upon moſt other vegetables, is the extrication of a quantity of fixed, and inflammable air, beſides earth, coal, alkaline ſalt and water.— And it is well known, that none of theſe are capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a contagious diſeaſe, though by inducing weakneſs they may diſpoſe the body to be more eaſily affected by contagion or other cauſes of fever.</p>
            <p>Dr. Blane who had frequent opportunities of ſeeing the Yellow Fever at Jamaica, in the year 1781 and 82, remarks that, "with regard to the cauſe of this fever, it differs from the Bilious Remittent in this, that the <hi>air</hi> of <hi>woods</hi> and <hi>marſhes</hi> is not neceſſary to produce it, for it was moſt commonly brought on by intemperance or by too much exerciſe in the heat of the ſun. It was obſervable however that it was more apt to ariſe when, beſides theſe cauſes, men were expoſed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome land air, or to the foul air of ſhips, either from <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious effluvia</hi> or from the putrefaction that takes place in <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected holds.</hi>"—It is alſo remarkable, adds Dr. Blane, that this fever is confined almoſt entirely to new comers from a cold or a temperate climate.</p>
            <p>Dr. Moſely who publiſhed his obſervations on tropical diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſince Dr. Blane, and who practiſed 12 years in Jamaica, ſays the <hi>Yellow Fever</hi> is totally different from the Remitting Bilious Fever; for all habits, natives as well as foreigners are ſubject to the latter, particularly after the periodical rains and in the fall of the year; whereas the Yellow Fever, is confined almoſt entirely to foreigners or new comers." But as he was ignorant of its contagious nature he has aſcribed it to the ſenſible quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the atmoſphere operating on plethoric habits not acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the climate. Hence he has named it the endemial Cauſus, or inflammatory fever of hot climates, Dr. Jackſon alſo who reſided ſome time in Jamaica, and has lately publiſhed an
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026836_0005_0FD1E1D5EBE077B8"/>
excellent treatiſe on fevers, ſays "the Yellow Fever ſeldom at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks any but new comers in that iſland, whereas the remitting fever attacks perſons of all deſcriptions, whether natives or foreigners, a fact which irrefragably proves that there actually exiſts ſome eſſential difference between the two diſeaſes."</p>
            <p>To theſe I might add the opinions of many more all tending to prove that the Yellow Fever is no way connected with the genus of Bilious Fever.</p>
            <p>Dr. Mitchel in his letter on the Yellow Fever which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Virginia in 1741, conſidered the diſeaſe as ariſing from ſpecific contagion, and ſays it was imported twice into that ſtate by ſhips of war from the Weſt Indies".<note n="*" place="bottom">Mitchell's letter to Dr. Franklin, p. 22.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That Bilious Remittents are not contagious, is not "a new doctrine held and propagated in no part of the world but in this city," as Dr. Ruſh aſſerts, is evident from the writings of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, Vanſwieten, Monro, Lind, and Cullen, and many other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the moſt reſpectable character. Some of the authors quoted by Dr. Ruſh, in ſupport of the oppoſite ſide of the queſtion, were not qualified to diſcern the connection between cauſe and effect, and others have publiſhed ſuch incongruous, and abſurd things that it would be a waſte of time to attempt a formal refutation of their opinions.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore only obſerve, that if thoſe authors were not deceived, why have we not more frequent inſtances of the contagious nature of ſuch diſeaſes, and why do not Phyſicians diſcover ſuch caſes in this country as well as in others. The efficient cauſe of an effect muſt neceſſarily always produce the ſame effect under ſimilar circumſtances; the ſame Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces often occur here in which theſe diſeaſes are ſaid to have been contagious in other countries, but no ſuch effect is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to follow; The Bilious Fever, therefore, is not conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</p>
            <p>Again, If the Bilious Fever were contagious it ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate a fever of the ſame kind, which would always be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the ſame leading or characteriſtic ſymptoms, but this is never the caſe, therefore the Bilious Fever is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious. But the Yellow Fever is contagious of conſequence it is not a higher <hi>gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi> of the Bilious Remitting Fever, and the title which Dr. Ruſh has given it is wrong. Surely if Dr. Lind had thought the Bilious Fever was contagious, he would not have ſaid the Yellow Fever in Jamaica was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, and have quoted Dr Nayſmith in ſupport of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026836_0006_0FD1E1D768EFF718"/>
when he entertained an opinion that it was only a higher degree of the Bilious Fever of hot climates<note n="*" place="bottom">Lind on infection p. 212.</note>; It is true if he was miſtaken in the one circumſtance, he might have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the other; but it can hardly be ſuppoſed, that all the other authors that I have mentioned, would have been totally ſilent if they had ever met with caſes of ſuch fevers, propagated by contagion.</p>
            <p>Dr. Gardner, who is an advocate for the contagious power of Intermittent and Remittent fevers, acknowledges that "they muſt be changed in their nature before they can become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, in conſequence of the impure air of crowded wards or other unfavourable ſituations." Dr. Black alſo, on the human ſpecies, ſays "theſe fevers not only differ from continued fevers in their not being contagious, but alſo in their exacerbations occurring only once in 24 hours, whereas thoſe of the continued genus have two exacerbations in the courſe of every 24 hours." A ſimilar obſervation is made by Dr. Cullen in his <hi>firſt lines.</hi> This is certainly giving up the point; for a diſeaſe changed in its nature is no longer the ſame, and when fevers occcur with characters different from thoſe from whence they are ſuppoſed to originate in particular ſituations, it only implies that a contagion has been generated in conſequence of ſuch ſituation, different from the original diſeaſe; this takes place where num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are crowded together, and freſh air is excluded, though every perſon was perfectly healthy before they were ſo crowded and deprived of freſh air<note n="†" place="bottom">The Exhalations which are conſtantly though inſenſibly iſſuing from the human body in a ſtate of health, or when affected with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe not contagious, is generally conſidered to be harmleſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore has had little attention paid to it; but if it be long confined for want of free ventilation, or retained in apparel or bed clothes of the perſon, it will be accumulated and acted upon in ſuch a manner as to produce a contagion little inferior in degree of virulence, to that which comes from the body, labouring under a nervous or putrid fever. In moſt caſes however, this contagious matter does not affect the perſon from whom it iſſues ſo readily as it does others, becauſe the body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes from habit inſenſible to its action, unleſs after the application of unuſually debilitating cauſes; in conſequence of which, a preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural prediſpoſition is induced. A melancholy proof of this is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Stow's Chronicle for 1577, in conſequence of a priſoner who was arraigned at the aſſizes held at Oxford, commonly called the black aſſizes, and at the aſſizes held at the old Bailey in the year 1750, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Sir John Pringle. At which time numbers received the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion which iſſued from the clothing of the Priſoners, though they were not affected themſelves.</note>. As this part of my ſubject is intended
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026836_0007_0FD1E1D96C751E68"/>
for medical people, I need only appeal to medical records for the truth of what I have advanced. I ſhall only add that the contagion ſo generated is always of a ſpecific nature, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions a fever of a continued and not of an Intermitting or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting form.</p>
            <p>According to the principles laid down by Dr. Ruſh, where and whenever vegetable putrefaction abounds in a hot ſeaſon, the contagion of the Yellow Fever muſt neceſſarily be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; if this were the caſe it would appear every year in Madrid, which is ſituated almoſt in the middle of an extenſive plain, where the climate is exceedingly ſultry during the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſeaſon, and where, according to the obſervations of Lord Kaim in his ſketches of the hiſtory of man, heaps of unmoleſted dirt and putrefaction, raiſe in every part of that populous, and crowded city the moſt intolerable ſtench, and fill the air with putrid exhalations, ſo groſs as almoſt to ſuffocate a ſtranger upon his firſt arrival. Theſe however have never yet produced the Yellow Fever. Nor is there any records of its having ever appeared at Carthagena, where we are told by Mr. Townſend, the weather is ſtill hotter than at Madrid, the ſtreets more filthy, and the air more replete with putrid exhalations; though "a bilious fever prevails there every autumn, in conſequence of its proximity to an extenſive marſh on its eaſt ſide called the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>major." But theſe differ in no reſpect from remittents of other Countries, except that putrid ſymptoms ſooner come on than in colder climates with a purer air.</p>
            <p>But we need not explore foreign Countries for evidence to prove that the Yellow Fever is not the product of vegetable putrefaction conjoined with great heat, but is a diſeaſe eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally different from every other hitherto known; for we have many ſituations in our own Country, which abound with a greater quantity of putrid vegetables than Philadelphia, nor are evidence wanting to prove that Philadelphia has had more putrid matter in it, and in its vicinity, in former years when the ſummers were both dryer and hotter than the laſt. The year 1782, when almoſt every blade of graſs was conſumed by heat and drought, and ſome of the marſhy ground ſet on fire by the heat of the ſun, or by the action of the electric fluid on the inflammable air generated in ſuch places, muſt be recollected by numbers, but if it is not, may be found on record; yet there was no Yellow Fever here then, nor in any part of United Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; nor at any other time, but what has or might have been traced to importation, as I ſhall make appear in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel.</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:026836_0008_0FD1E1DE24C2B888"/>But what ſhews in the moſt forcible manner, that the diſeaſe did not depend upon ſituation or the influence of putrid vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table exhalation, is the manner in which it began and ſpread through the city, and alſo in New York in the year 1791, from the middle of Auguſt to the middle of October. Epidemics, ſuch as bilious remittents <note n="*" place="bottom">"Some Phyſicians have ſuppoſed this fever was immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced (viz. the Yellow Fever which occurred at Nev York in the year 1791,) by an exhalation from a large quantity of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I am alſo induced to doubt this being the exciting (or direct) cauſe of the fever, from the perſons who were firſt affected reſiding at ſome diſtance from the dock on which the mud was depoſited; and from its not appearing in other parts of the city where the Slips were cleared out in the ſame manner, and depoſited in like ſituations, until it extended gradually from the place where it firſt ſhewed itſelf." Addoms's Diſſertation, &amp;c. p. 24.</note> which ariſe from ſeaſon and ſoil, attack numbers at the ſame time, and always the debilitated firſt, and the more robuſt afterwards as they alſo become debilitated. But this was not the caſe with the Yellow Fever, Synochus Icteroides or Gaſtritis Contagioſa, which prevailed laſt year in Philadelphia. On the contrary this diſeaſe began at a lodging houſe, and ordinary kept by Richard Dennie in water ſtreet, where two French men from the Weſt Indies were then at lodgings, and where the firſt caſe was obſerved on the firſt or ſecond of Auguſt by Dr. Phyſick; and on the 3d of the ſame month in the ſame houſe, another patient with the diſeaſe was viſitted by Dr. Cathrall; from whence it ſpread gradually as people in the neighbourhood had intercourſe with the infected and with one another. To that neighbourhood it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined for more than two weeks, before it occaſioned much a alarm, or even any ſuſpicion of its being contagious. Dr. Ruſh acknowledges that he had no ſuſpicion of the nature or origin of the diſeaſe, before the 19th, when he was in conſultation on the caſe of Mrs. Lemaigre, and was informed by Dr. Hodge, that ſeveral had died very ſuddenly in that neighbourhood, with ſymptoms of a very malignant fever; and was the ſame day told by Dr. Foulke that a quantity of damaged coffee which was intolerably offenſive, had been diſcharged on Mr Ball's Wharf."</p>
            <p>From theſe circumſtances, Dr. Ruſh, before he had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of informing himſelf ſufficiently of the facts, conceived
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026836_0009_0FD1E1E33B4E1160"/>
the idea that the diſeaſe was the offspring of the exhalation from the damaged coffee; in conſequence of which, he immediately publiſhed that opinion. Need I tell the reader that Dr. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grado publiſhed a book, in which he adviſed copious bleeding and immeaſurable quantities of warm water for the cure of the Dropſy, and when he diſcovered his miſtake, he obſerved to Gil Blas with a ſolemn air, "though I know I am wrong yet it is better that all Valadolid ſhould die than for me to change my opinion." If Dr. Ruſh's opinion "had not been founded on the baſeleſs fabric of a viſion" the diſeaſe would have attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed numbers at the ſame time as has been already obſerved, but inſtead of that it affected none but thoſe who came within a certain diſtance of the ſick or into the air of the ſick room, for it is well known that all who ſhut themſelves up in their houſes, retired into the country, and ſhunned every ſubſtance which had been in contact with or near to thoſe actually infected; and that every one who obſerved theſe precautions, though daily abroad in the open ſtreets and markets, eſcaped the diſeaſe, as was alſo the caſe with the priſoners in the jail, the penſioners in the alms-houſe, and the patients in the Hoſpital, where ſtrict attention was paid to avoid all intercourſe with the infected.</p>
            <p>Can any man of common ſenſe ſuppoſe this could poſſibly have been the caſe if the diſeaſe had been occaſioned by the exhalations from putrid coffee or other putrid vegetable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, diffuſed abroad through the atmoſphere of the whole city, as has been ſo poſitively aſſerted. Oracles may utter any thing at Delphos, and credulity will ſwallow it.</p>
            <p>Having thus proved the opinion of the gentleman to whom I am oppoſed in ſentiment, to be erroneous, I now proceed to ſtate the evidence in favour of the opinion that the diſeaſe was imported: and though I ſhould not be able to eſtabliſh it, by direct or poſitive proofs, I expect the circumſtantial evidence, which I ſhall ſay before the reader, will be ſufficient to convince him beyond the power of reſiſtance, that the diſeaſe was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into Philadelphia by importation, and was not generated in it.</p>
            <p>The reader need not be informed, that much difficulty ariſes, and many obſtacles are generally oppoſed to inveſtigations of this kind, from the parties moſt immediately concerned. I need only refer to Ruſſell's account of the difficulty that attended the detection of the veſſel and goods, by which the plague was introduced into Marſeilles in 1720, its introduction into Aleppo in 1761, and into Moſcow in Ruſſia in 17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

from the Weſt India iſlands, in ſome of which the Yellow Fever had prevailed with unuſual mortality, ever ſince the year 1791, as appears from Dr. Chiſholm's account publiſhed in the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries for 1793, and from a letter now in poſſeſſion of Dr. Cumming of this city from Dr. George Davidſon <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>"I have obſerved with uneaſineſs and concern (ſays Dr. David<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,) that an Epidemical Fever nearly ſimilar to that which we have had in this iſland for ſix months paſt, has appeared in Philadelphia."</p>
                  <q rend="inline normQuotes">
                     <p>The diſeaſe as it occurred with us, attacked with more violence and proved more fatal than I ever recollect to have ſeen during a reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of 22 years in the Weſt Indies; and part of that time at St Lucia, where I had an opportunity of ſeeing the diſeaſe amongſt the troops and ſailors in all its forms.</p>
                     <p>Our dry ſeaſon, adds Dr. Davidſon, commonly commences the beginning of December and continues till May; the laſt ſeaſon, however, the rains continued with but little intermiſſion till the end of march, when it was ſucceeded by hot ſultry weather. The thermometer ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally at 90 in the town, and the nights equally hot and ſultry with the day. Early in April the Yellow Fever made its appearance, both on ſhore and on board the ſhipping. The young, plethoric, and thoſe lately arrived from a cold climate were chiefly affected. The inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory ſymptoms run high. Bloodletting, bliſters, and gentle and conſtant purging anſwered at firſt; but on the further progreſs of the diſeaſe and the weather ſtill continuing hot, the marks of inflammatory diatheſis became leſs evident, and the pulſe ſunk upon bloodletting. The vomiting did not appear upon the firſt days, and ſooner ended in black vomiting. We found it neceſſary to alter our practice; but I muſt candidly confeſs that till I adopted the uſe of cold bathing, under theſe circumſtances which indicated a typhus type our endeavours to cure it were attended with little ſucceſs. In the inflammatory ſtate the diſeaſe was more at command, but in the other the irritability of the ſtomach was ſuch that we could not uſe tonics. Neither bark, wine, nor opium could be retained. Upon a general review of the ill ſucceſs which attended the practice of the medical gentlemen in this iſland, as well as in Grenada and Tobago, I was inclined to try the effects of cold bathing, which I had uſed with ſucceſs in the advanced ſtage of the Remittent Fever in caſes of debility, low delirium, ſubſultus tendinum, and other marks of debility without any internal local affection occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. At firſt I tried the effects of the bathing in the advanced ſtate of the fever but without any ſucceſs; but as every other plan had ſtill failed I began with it in the very commencement. Warm tamarind or cream of tartar and manna beverage was given immediately after appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the cold bath, to excite ſweat and open the body if that effect was not previouſly produced by glyſters; and the inſtant that a ſweat appeared bark mixed with the beverage was given in as large quantities as the ſtomach would retain, without paying any attention to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I am happy in announcing that this mode of treatment has been attended with the utmoſt ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>The cold bathing ſeemed to take off the determination to the brain, to remove irritability and to determine to the ſurface, for in every caſe a plentiful ſweat was excited.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Dr. Chiſholm informs us that this diſeaſe made its appearance among the troops at St Georges, in the iſland of Granada, about the latter end of September, 1791, and that having found all the common means to fail, he made trial of mercury, which he repeated in conjunction with thebaic tincture, in doſes of five grains every four hours till it produced ptyaliſm, and that in no inſtance in which it produced that effect, did it fail of effecting a cure. He found bloodletting alſo uſeful as the winter months approached, whereas when the diſeaſe firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, it had a bad effect. Such was alſo the caſe in Philadelphia.</p>
                  <p>(Hence the neceſſity of attending to ſymptoms inſtead of the name or ſtage of the diſeaſe.)</p>
                  <p>In another part of the ſame latter Dr. Davidſon ſays, he has to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that "in very few inſtances have I met with bilious vomiting, and where it did occur the patient always recovered; that diſſections rarely ſhewed any affection of the liver; the gall bladder was generally tinged with bile of the natural colour, but thicker than uſual, as we ſhould expect from its long retention. The ſtomach was frequently found without any preternatural appearances, except when the black vomiting occurred, and then it was found gangrenous. Upon ſome occaſions the blood veſſels of the brain were highly turgid with blood, and the ventricles with a yellowiſh fluid."</p>

"The iſlands of Barbadoes and Dominica continue to be afflicted with the Malignant Fever, (ſome of the other papers ſay the Yellow Fever) about 300 white inhabitants have periſhed in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and near 500 in the latter."</p>
            <p>It was alſo epidemic and extremely mortal among the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean troops at the ſame time at St Domingo, from whence a multitude of the inhabitants fled at different times in the ſummer of 1793, on account of a deſolating war, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the inſurrections of the ſlaves in that iſland, and took ſhelter in Philadelphia. Several ſick perſons as well as others were brought away.</p>

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:026836_0012_0FD1E1E9170835B0"/>Two veſſels in particular from that iſland conſigned to the houſe of Vanuxem and Lombart, arrived in this port after the middle of July, and came-to at their wharf, which is very near to the houſe where the diſeaſe made its firſt appearance. One of theſe named the ſloop Amelia, William Williams Maſter, arrived in the port from Borgne, a ſmall port of St Domingo, laden with coffee with five hands beſides the Maſter, and came-to at Mr. Vanuxem's wharf on the 24th of July, where ſhe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately began to diſcharge her cargo, part of which, from a leak ſhe had get in her paſſage was very wet and damaged; ſeveral hundred weight were thrown into the dock which at low water is covered with water, and on the 30th, 98 bags of that which was leaſt damaged was ſold on the wharf, as appears by a letter from Mr Vanuxem, and the bill of ſales of Mr Footman auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneer. This veſſel left the wharf on the firſt of Auguſt to heave down.</p>
            <p>"When this Veſſel unloaded the coffee, Mr. Vanuxem at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts that no ſmell whatever was obſerved, but after ſhe was unloaded, a moſt intolerable ſtench was occaſioned for two or three days, while the ſailors were clearing the hold of the bilge water, which in all veſſels when ſuffered to ſtagnate, becomes putrid and is very offenſive, but has never been obſerved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a yellow or any other contagious fever.</p>
            <p>It is true the captain and hands were ſick while employed in clearing the water out of the hold, but as "they all recovered within three days without the aid of medicine," it cannot be ſuſpected <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

            <p>The other Veſſel which arrived at the ſame wharf, about the ſame time, together with the Sans Culottes privateer, and her prize, the ſhip Flora of Glaſgow had ſtopped at Cheſter, where the Maſter, Hamilton Sage, died with unequivocal ſymptom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Mr Kirlin, who received compenſation for the trouble and expences he had been at on account of the captain, from Mr. Vanuxem, declares that there were ſeveral paſſengers ſick on board the Veſſel when ſhe left Cheſter.</p>
            <p>Several ſick perſons were alſo ſeen coming on ſhore at Mr. Vanuxems, and Mr Lemaigre's wharfs, between the 25th of

July and the firſt of Auguſt, by Major Hodgſon, Mr Lemaigre, his Clerk, Mr Aſhbridge, his wife, and ſeveral other reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table people, who reſided in Water-ſtreet near to the ſuſpected wharfs, and ſome were buried at different times with evident ſymptoms of the Yellow Fever from on board thoſe Veſſels.</p>
            <p>The diſeaſe not being at firſt ſuſpected to be contagious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented theſe from being particularly noticed, till it was too late to make effectual enquiry.</p>
            <p>A reſpectable citizen of Philadelphia, ſupercargo of one of our veſſels, informed Mr. M. Carey, that he ſaw in July ſix or ſeven people ſick of this fever, on board a brig at Cape Francois bound to Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>Several upon coming on ſhore went into Mr Lemaigre's, and Mr Vanuxem's kitchens, to reſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>But if it could not be proved that any one came ſick on ſhore, it is no argument againſt the contagion having been brought in goods cloſe packed from the iſlands; medical records are full of ſuch inſtances.</p>
            <p>There are alſo numerous inſtances of people in cloſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined places, generating a contagion which is communicable to others, though they are inſenſible to it themſelves, ſee Stow's Chronicle, Meads paper on infection, Blane's obſervations, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From all the foregoing circumſtances ſingly and collectively, I think I may fairly conclude without heſitation, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was introduced by importation, and was not generated in this city, and that a different opinion is a reflection upon the credit of its ſalubrity which was never before called in queſtion, and which all former bills of mortality demonſtrate, it does not deſerve. By theſe bills it appears that there has never more died in a year than in the proportion of one in 50 ſince the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of inoculation, except when the Yellow Fever was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into it from the Weſt Indies: whereas in moſt of the cities of Europe, there dies every year in the proportion of 1 in 20 or 30 at moſt.</p>

For proofs of this I appeal to Gough's hiſtory of the Society of Friends, vol. iii. p. 516, Lind on infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Lining's account of its ſeveral occurrences in Charleſtown. Dr. Mitchels letter to Dr. Franklin reſpecting its appearance in Virginia in 1741. Dr. Redman's notes read in the College of Phyſicians laſt fall, giving an account of it in 1762. When it
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026836_0014_0FD1E1ECDE4C1E68"/>
appeared in New York in 1791, its origin was never enquired into. It has been aſcribed by Dr. Addoms of that place in his diſſertation on it, to ſpecific contagion, but how generated or from whence brought, he does not ſay. Let the reader alſo recollect that the diſeaſe is peculiar to, and is always exiſting more or leſs among thoſe who emigrate to tropical climates, and that when exported from thence it has never become epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic except in very hot weather, and in the atmoſphere peculiar to a town, or confined place; that it has never exiſted or been active in this country under any other circumſtances, and that like moſt other peſtilential fevers, it is deſtroyed entirely by cold and froſt; and let him ſubſcribe to the opinion that it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated here, if he can.</p>
