         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>OYE factious, ſeditious, and diſcontented crew! will you never believe that you are <hi>happy,</hi> when no more than a <hi>bare belief</hi> is requiſite to make you ſo?— Infatuated mortals! are you determined, like Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gold, to "<hi>feel, feel, feel,</hi> and <hi>touch, touch, touch,"</hi> before you will allow your happineſs to be real? Dreadful obſtinacy! how unacquainted are you with the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-working powers of <hi>imagination!</hi>—Can you not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that your hunger and thirſt are gratified, unleſs you <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink?</hi> Can you not believe that you are cloathed and warm, unleſs you are covered from the inclemency of the ſeaſon?—O what political unbelief is this?—To what then muſt your wiſe legiſlators have recourſe? they have bawled to you till their lungs are jaded; they have written to you till words are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and ye ſtill obſtinately continue to be <hi>unhappy.</hi> What! will you not believe the King himſelf, and all the Royal Family? Not believe the Prime Miniſter,

Again, how will you be able to reſiſt the irrefutable logic of <hi>Muſquetry</hi> and <hi>Artillery?</hi> or how will you be able to deny you are HAPPY, when the <hi>ſword</hi> is pointed to your breaſt? recollect how ſucceſsfully Mahomet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued this way, and believe you are happy in this world, leſt they ſilence your murmurs, by ſending you into another, to ſearch for happineſs! but alas you are a banditti of incorrigible Heretics: I know you will not believe you are <hi>happy,</hi> although the Holieſt Man in Canterbury were to declare it to you on his marrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones!</p>
            <p>But let me, for a few moments, direct your attention to the great ſcource of all your happineſs; to the moſt <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>happy Conſtitution!</hi>—Take a view of each well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed ſyſtem in each department of government; and you <hi>may</hi> be aſtoniſhed at the ſcence thrown open before you!

               <l>—WHEN Time was young,</l>
               <l>And Earth was clad in Nature's rudeſt garb,</l>
               <l>Dark tangled foreſts, deſarts vaſt and drear,</l>
               <l>Wild heaths, and reedy lakes, and ruſhy fens;</l>
               <l>When freſh and vig'rous from th' Eternal hand,</l>

               <l>The bus'neſs of bis life to propagate,</l>
               <l>To draw nutrition, and to keep at bay</l>
               <l>Inſtinct's ferocious ſwarms; then the wide world</l>
               <l>Was but a huge eſtate, Heav'n the prime Lord,</l>
               <l>And all mankind his equal tenantry.</l>
               <l>No power was known, ſave that which Nature owns—</l>
               <l>Paternal ſway—Clad in the ſpoils of brutes,</l>
               <l>And unreſtrain'd as is the mountain's blaſt,</l>

Compos'd his worldly good; with theſe in view,</l>
               <l>On the rough margin of ſome ſtream or lake,</l>
               <l>Begirt with matted brakes and foreſts tall,</l>
               <l>He rear'd, with unſkill'd hand, his wattled ſhed.</l>
               <l>Around him nimble as the bounding roe,</l>
               <l>His naked offspring play'd. Time brought deſires,</l>
               <l>And from deſires, which to repreſs, was ſin,</l>

               <l>Affection filial, fondneſs for the ſeat</l>
               <l>Of all their youthful gambols, and the dread</l>
               <l>Of climes leſs bounteous, fix'd him to the ſoil.</l>
               <l>The patriot fire now glimmer'd; ſmaller tribes,</l>

               <l>And by their ardent youth were ſoon made one.</l>
               <l>Thus congregated man, and thus wild waſtes,</l>
               <l>The haunts of ſhaggy tribes, were ſprinkled o'er</l>
               <l>With many a human dwelling. Settled now,</l>
               <l>Man's wond'rous faculties began to ſhoot.</l>
               <l>For heav'n who plac'd him midſt this warring ſcene,</l>
               <l>Unarm'd and void of cov'ring, gave him pow'rs</l>

               <l>Gave him by his own efforts to improve:</l>
               <l>Hence came the jav'lin, and the furry garb,</l>
               <l>And all that poliſh'd regions now enjoy.</l>
               <l>Each ſire was ſtill the ſov'reign of his ſhed,</l>

               <l>As laws ſhould e'er be fram'd, like yon bright orb</l>

               <l>All by the ties which they themſelves had made,</l>
