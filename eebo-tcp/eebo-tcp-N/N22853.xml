            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Advertiſement.</head>
            <p>As the Editor of this collection is conſcious there may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſome defects in the arrangement of his materials, he thinks it neceſſary to acquaint the Public with the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their appearing in a leſs finiſhed ſtate than he could have wiſhed to preſent them. Some gentlemen of fortune and literary abilities had once conceived the ſcheme of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to the entertainment and inſtruction of the riſing generation by a ſelection of the moſt intereſting and improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hiſtories from different authors. They intended to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late from the different languages of Europe whatever might engage the minds of children to the improvement of their knowledge, and inſpire them with an early love of virtue. To theſe they were to have added a judicious ſelection from natural hiſtory, and the moſt entertaining deſcriptions that are to be found in the ample collection of modern voyages; together with many original pieces of their own compoſition. All theſe it was preſumed, would contribute a pleaſing and uſeful miſcellany for the uſe of children, which they intended to have publiſhed in periodical numbers. After they had made ſome progreſs in the execution of this ſcheme, they were compelled, by accidents which it is unneceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, to abandon their deſign. But, though the modeſty of the authors would rather have led them to ſuppreſs what they could not engage to finiſh, the Editor, to whom their papers were entruſted, has judged them too valuable to be entirely ſuppreſſed. He has, therefore, collected them into a volume, with the hopes that this Miſcellany may not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear undeſerving of the public favour, and may be deemed no contemptible addition to that branch of literature which propoſes to itſelf the important object of pleaſing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing children.</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF LITTLE JACK.</head>
            <p>THERE was once a poor lame old man that lived in the midſt of a wide uncultivated moor, in the north of England. He had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been a ſoldier, and had almoſt loſt the uſe of one leg by a wound he had received in battle, when he was fighting againſt the enemies of his country This poor man, when he found himſelf thus diſabled, built a little hut of clay, which he covered with turf dug from the common. He had a little bit of ground which he made a ſhift to cultivate with
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:030190_0006_0FE504219C18BBD8"/>
his own hands; and which ſupplied him with potatoes and vegetables; beſides this, he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gained a few halfpence by opening a gate for travellers, which ſtood near his houſe. He did not indeed get much, becauſe few people paſſed that way. What he earned was, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, enough to purchaſe cloaths, and the few neceſſaries he wanted. But though poor, he was ſtrictly honeſt, and never failed night and morning to addreſs his prayers to God; by which means he was reſpected by all who knew him, much more than many who were ſuperior to him in rank and fortune. This old man had one domeſtic. In his walks over the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, he one day found a little kid that had loſt its mother, and was almoſt famiſhed with hunger: he took it home to his cottage, fed it with the produce of his garden, and nurſed it till it grew ſtrong and vigorous. Little Nan, (for that was the name he gave it) returned his cares with gratitude, and became as much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to him as a dog. All day ſhe browzed upon the herbage that grew around his hut, and at night repoſed upon the ſame bed of ſtraw with her maſter. Frequently did ſhe divert him with her innocent tricks and gambols. She would neſtle her little head in his boſom, and eat out of his hand part of his ſcanty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of bread; which he never failed to divide with his favourite. The old man often beheld her with ſilent joy, and, in the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent effuſions of his heart, would lift his hands to heaven, and thank the Deity, that, even in the midſt of poverty and diſtreſs, had raiſed him up one faithful friend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:030190_0007_0FE503C7E047A048"/>
One night, in the beginning of winter, the old man thought he heard the feeble cries and lamentations of a child. As he was naturally charitable, he aroſe and ſtruck a light, and, going out of his cottage, examined on every ſide. It was not long before he diſcerned an infant, which had probably been dropped by ſome ſtrolling beggar or gypſy. The old man ſtood amazed at the ſight, and knew not what to do. Shall I, ſaid he, who find it ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to live at preſent, incumber myſelf with the care of an helpleſs infant, that will not for many years be capable of contributing to its own ſubſiſtence? And yet, added he, ſoftening with pity, can I deny aſſiſtance to an human being ſtill more miſerable than myſelf?—Will not that Providence which feeds the birds of the wood and the beaſts of the field, and which has promiſed to bleſs all thoſe that are kind and charitable, aſſiſt my feeble endeavours?—At leaſt, let me give it food and lodging for this night; for without I receive it into my cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, the poor abandoned wretch muſt periſh with cold before the morning. Saying this, he took it up in his arms, and perceived it was a fine healthy boy, though covered with rags; the little foundling too ſeemed to be ſenſible of his kindneſs, and ſmiling in his face, ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out his little arms, as if to embrace his benefactor.</p>
            <p>When he had brought it into his hut, he began to be extremely embarraſſed how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it food: but looking at Nan, he recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected that ſhe had juſt loſt her kid, and ſaw her udder diſtended with milk: he, therefore,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:030190_0008_0FE50423260D8FD8"/>
called her to him, and, preſenting the child to the teat, was overjoyed to find, that it ſucked as naturally as if it had really found a mother. The goat too ſeemed to receive pleaſure from the efforts of the child, and ſubmitted without oppoſition to diſcharge the duties of a nurſe. Contented with this experiment, the old man wrapped the child up as warmly as he could, and ſtretched himſelf out to reſt with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of having done an humane action. Early the next morning he was awakened by the cries of the child for food, which with the aſſiſtance of his faithful Nan, he ſuckled as he had done the night before. And now the old man began to feel an intereſt in the child, which made him defer ſome time longer the taking meaſures to be delivered from its care. Who knows, ſaid he, but Providence which has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this child in ſo wonderful a manner, may have deſtined it to ſomething equally won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful in his future life; and may bleſs me as the humble agent of his decrees? At leaſt, as he grows bigger, he will be a pleaſure and comfort to me, in this lonely cabin, and will aſſiſt in cutting turf for fuel, and cultivating the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. From this time he became more and more attached to the little foundling; who, in a ſhort time, learned to conſider the old man as a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and delighted him with its innocent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes. Gentle Nanny too, the goat, ſeemed to adopt him with equal tenderneſs as her off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring: ſhe would ſtretch herſelf out upon the ground, while he crawled upon his hands and knees towards her; and when he had ſatisfied
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:030190_0009_0FE503C9C8E89FD8"/>
his hunger by ſucking, he would neſtle between her legs and go to ſleep in her boſom.</p>
            <p>It was wonderful to ſee how this child, thus left to nature, increaſed in ſtrength and vigour. Unfettered by bandages or reſtraints, his limbs acquired their due proportions and form; his countenance was full and florid, and gave indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of perfect health; and, at an age when other children are ſcarcely able to ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the aſſiſtance of a nurſe, this little foundling could run alone. It was true, that he ſometimes failed in his attempts, and fell to the ground; but the ground was ſoft, and little Jack, for ſo the old man called him, was not tender or delicate; he never minded thumps or bruiſes, but boldly ſcrambled up again and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued his way. In a ſhort time, little Jack was completely maſter of his legs; and as the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer came on, he attended his mamma, the
<figure/>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:030190_0010_0FE50426E52DEDD8"/>
goat, upon the common, and uſed to play with her for hours together; ſometimes rolling under her belly, now climbing upon her back, and friſking about as if he had really been a kid. As to his cloathing, Jack was not much incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with it; he had neither ſhoes, nor ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nor ſhirt; but the weather was warm, and Jack felt himſelf ſo much lighter for every kind of exerciſe. In a ſhort time after this, Jack began to imitate the ſounds of his papa the man, and his mamma the goat; nor was it long before he learned to ſpeak articulately. The old man delighted with this firſt dawn of reaſon, uſed to place him upon his knee, and converſe with him for hours together, while his pottage was ſlowly boiling amid the embers of a turf fire. As he grew bigger, Jack became of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able uſe to his father; he could truſt him to look after the gate, and open it during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: and, as to the cookery of the family, it was not long before Jack was a complete pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and could make broth almoſt as well as his daddy himſelf. During the winter nights, the old man uſed to entertain him with ſtories of what he had ſeen during his youth; the battles and ſieges he had been witneſs to, and the hardſhips he had undergone; all this he related with ſo much vivacity that Jack was never tired of liſtening. But what delighted him beyond meaſure was to ſee daddy ſhoulder his crutch, inſtead of a muſket, and give the word of command. To the right—to the left—preſent—ſire—march—halt—all this was familiar to Jack's ear as ſoon as he could ſpeak, and before he was ſix years old, he poized and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030190_0011_0FE503CC86E26BB0"/>
preſented a broom-ſtick, which his daddy gave him for that purpoſe, with as good a grace as any ſoldier of his age in Europe.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>The old man too inſtructed him in ſuch plain and ſimple morals and religion, as he was able to explain. "Never tell an untruth, Jack, ſaid he, even though you were to be flayed alive; a ſoldier never lies." Jack held up his head, marched acroſs the floor, and promiſed his daddy that he would always tell the truth like a ſoldier. But the old man, as he was ſomething of a ſcholar, had a great ambition that his darling ſhould learn to read, and write; and this was a work of ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; for he had neither printed book, nor pens, nor paper in his cabin. Induſtry, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, enables us to overcome difficulties; in the ſummer time, as the old man ſat before his cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, he would draw letters in the ſand, and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030190_0012_0FE50430504A6130"/>
teach Jack to name them ſingly, until he was acquainted with the whole alphabet, he then proceeded to ſyllables; and after that to words; all which his little pupil learned to pronounce with great facility: and, as he had a ſtrong propenſity to imitate what he ſaw, he not only acquired the power of reading words, cut of tracing all the letters which compoſed them, on the ſand.</p>
            <p>About this time, the poor goat which had nurſed Jack ſo faithfully, grew ill and died. He tended her with the greateſt affection and aſſiduity during her illneſs, brought her the freſheſt herbs for food, and would frequently ſupport her head for hours together upon his little boſom. But it was all in vain; he loſt his poor mammy, as he uſed to call her, and was for ſome time inconſolable; for Jack, though his knowledge was bounded, had an uncommon degree of gratitude and affection in his temper. He was not able to talk as finely about love, tenderneſs, and ſenſibility, as many other little boys, that have enjoyed greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of education; but he felt the reality of them in his heart, and thought it ſo natural to love every thing that loves us, that he never even ſuſpected it was poſſible to do otherwiſe. The poor goat was buried in the old man's garden, and thither little Jack would often come and call upon his poor mammy Nan, and aſk her why ſhe had left him? One day, as he was thus employed, a lady happened to come by in a carriage, and overheard him before he was aware. Jack ran in an inſtant to open the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030190_0013_0FE503D5728AB498"/>
gate; but the lady ſtopped, and aſked him whom he was bemoaning ſo pitifully, and calling
<figure/>
upon? Jack anſwered, that it was his poor mammy, that was buried in the garden. The lady thought it very odd to hear of ſuch a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial place, and therefore proceeded to queſtion him, "How did your mammy get her living?" ſaid ſhe. "She uſed to graze here upon the common all day long," ſaid Jack. The lady was ſtill more aſtoniſhed; but the old man came out of his hut, and explained the whole affair to her, which ſurpriſed her very much; for though this lady had ſeen a great deal of the world, and had read a variety of books, it had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver once entered into her head that a child might grow ſtrong and vigorous by ſucking a goat, inſtead of eating pap. She therefore looked at Jack with amazement, admired his brown but animated face, and praiſed his ſhape and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030190_0014_0FE504324D70A0C8"/>
"Will you go with me, little boy, ſaid ſhe, and I will take care of you, if you behave well?" "No, ſaid Jack, I muſt ſtay with daddy; he has taken care of me for many years, and now I muſt take care of him; otherwiſe I ſhould like very well to go with ſuch a ſweet, good-natured lady." The lady was not diſpleaſed with Jack's anſwer, and putting her hand in her pocket, gave him half a crown, to buy him ſhoes and ſtockings, and purſued her jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            <p>Jack was not unacquainted with the uſe of money, as he had been often ſent to the next village to purchaſe bread and neceſſaries; but he was totally unacquainted with the uſe of ſhoes and ſtockings, which he had never worn in his life, or felt the want of. The next day, however, the old man bade him run to town, and lay his money out as the lady had deſired; for he had too much honour to think of diſobeying her commands, or ſuffering it to be expended for any other purpoſe. It was not long before Jack returned; but the old man was much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to ſee him come back as bare as he went out. "Heigh, Jack! ſaid he, where are the ſhoes and ſtockings which you were to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe?" "Daddy, anſwered Jack, I went to the ſhop, and juſt tried a pair for ſport, but I found them ſo cumberſome, that I could not walk, and I would not wear ſuch things, even if the lady would give me another half crown for doing it; ſo I laid the money out in a warm jacket for you, becauſe the winter is coming on, and you ſeem to be more afraid of the cold than formerly." Many ſuch inſtances
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030190_0015_0FE503D738460D38"/>
of conduct did Jack diſplay; from which it was eaſy to perceive, that he had an excellent ſoul, and generous temper. One failing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Jack was liable to; though a very good natured boy, he was a little too jealous of his honour. His daddy had taught him the uſe of his hands and legs, and Jack had ſuch diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the art of boxing, that he could beat every boy in the neighbourhood, of his age and ſize. Even if they were a head taller, it made no difference to Jack, provided they ſaid any thing to wound his honour; for otherwiſe he was the moſt mild, pacific creature in the world. One day that he had been ſent to the village, he returned with his eyes black, and his face ſwelled to a frightful ſize: it was even with difficulty that he was able to walk at all, ſo ſore was he with the pomelling he had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. "What have you been doing now, Jack?" ſaid the old man.—"Only fighting with Dick the butcher." "You rogue, ſaid the old man, he is twice as big as you are, and the beſt fighter in all the country." "What does that ſignify, ſaid Jack, he called you an old beggarman, and then I ſtruck him; and I will ſtrike him again whenever he calls you ſo, even if he ſhould beat me to pieces; for you know, daddy, that you are not a beggarman, but a ſoldier."</p>
            <p>In this manner lived little Jack, until he was twelve years old; at this time his poor old daddy fell ſick and became incapable of moving about. Jack did every thing he could think of for the poor man; he made him broths, he fed him with his own hands, he watched whole nights by his bed-ſide ſupporting his head and helping
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030190_0016_0FE50433D6DF3D68"/>
him when he wanted to move. But it was all in vain; his poor daddy grew daily worſe, and perceived it to be impoſſible that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. He one day therefore called little Jack to his bed-ſide, and preſſing his hand affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, told him that he was juſt going to die. Little Jack burſt into a flood of tears at this information, but his daddy deſired him to compoſe himſelf, and attend to the laſt advice
<figure/>
he ſhould be able to give him. "I have lived, ſaid the old man, a great many years, in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, but I do not know that I have been worſe off than if I had been rich. I have avoided, perhaps, many faults, and many uneaſineſſes, which I ſhould have incurred had I been in another ſituation; and though I have often wanted a meal and always ſared hard, I have enjoyed as much health and life as uſually falls to the lot of my betters. I am now going to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030190_0017_0FE503BB354928B8"/>
die; I feel it in every part; the breath will ſoon be out of my body; then I ſhall be put in the ground, and the worms will eat your poor old daddy." At this Jack renewed his tears and ſobbings, for he was unable to reſtrain them. But the old man ſaid; "Have patience, my child; though I ſhould leave this world, as I have always been ſtrictly honeſt and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to do my duty, I do not doubt but God will pity me, and convey me to a better place; where I ſhall be happier than I have ever been here. This is what I have always taught you, and this belief gives me the greateſt comfort in my laſt moments. The only regret I feel, is for you, my deareſt child, whom I leave unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for. But you are ſtrong and vigorous, and almoſt able to get your living. As ſoon as I am dead, you muſt go to the next village and inform the people, that they may come and bury me. You muſt then endeavour to get into ſervice, and work for your living; and, if you are ſtrictly honeſt and ſober, I do not doubt that you will find a livelihood, and that God, who is the common father of all, will protect and bleſs you. Adieu, my child, I grow faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and fainter; never forget your poor old daddy, nor the example he has ſet you; but in every ſituation of life diſcharge your duty, and live like a Soldier, and a Chriſtian." When the old man had with difficulty uttered theſe laſt inſtructions, his voice entirely failed him, his limbs grew cold and ſtiff, and in a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes he expired without a groan. Little Jack, who hung crying over his daddy, called upon him in vain, in vain endeavoured to revive
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030190_0018_0FE5043570FCC198"/>
him. At length he pulled off his cloaths, went into his daddy's bed, and endeavoured for many hours to animate him with the warmth of his own body; but finding all his endeavours fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, he concluded that he was indeed dead; and therefore, weeping bitterly, he dreſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and went to the village as he had been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. The poor little boy was thus left en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely deſtitute and knew not what to do; but one of the farmers, who had been acquainted with him before, offered to take him into his houſe, and give him his victuals, for a few months, till he could find a ſervice. Jack thankfully accepted the offer, and ſerved him faithfully for ſeveral months; during which time he learned to milk, to drive the plough, and never refuſed any kind of work he was able to perform. But, by ill luck, this good-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red farmer contracted a fever, by over-heating himſelf in the harveſt, and died in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of winter. His wife was therefore obliged to diſcharge her ſervants, and Jack was again turned looſe upon the world, with only his cloaths, and a ſhilling in his pocket, which his kind miſtreſs had made him a preſent of. He was very ſorry for the loſs of his maſter; but he was now grown bigger and ſtronger, and thought he ſhould eaſily find employment. He therefore ſet out upon his travels, walking all day, and inquiring at every farm-houſe for work. But in this attempt he was unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, for nobody choſe to employ a ſtranger: and though he lived with the greateſt econo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he ſoon found himſelf in a worſe ſituation than ever, without a farthing in his pocket, or
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030190_0019_0FE503D8CF654CA8"/>
a morſel of bread to eat. Jack, however, was not of a temper to be eaſily caſt down; he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſolutely on all day, but towards evening was overtaken by a violent ſtorm of rain, which wetted him to the ſkin before he could find a buſh for ſhelter. Now, poor Jack began to think of his old daddy, and the comforts he had formerly enjoyed upon the common, where he had always a roof to ſhelter him, and a ſlice of bread for ſupper. But tears and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were vain; and therefore, as ſoon as the ſtorm was over, he purſued his journey, in hopes of finding ſome barn or out-houſe to creep into for the reſt of the night. While he was thus wandering about, he ſaw at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance a great light, which ſeemed to come from ſome prodigious fire. Jack did not know what this could be; but, in his preſent ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he thought a fire no diſagreeable object, and therefore determined to approach it. When he came nearer, he ſaw a large build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which ſeemed to ſpout fire and ſmoke at ſeveral openings, and heard an inceſſant noiſe of blows, and the rattling of chains. Jack was at firſt a little frightened, but ſummoning all his courage, he crept cautiouſly on to the building, and looking through a chink, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſeveral men and boys employed in blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fires and hammering burning maſſes of iron. This was a very comfortable ſight to him in his preſent forlorn condition; ſo finding a door half open, he ventured in, and placed himſelf as near as he dared to one of the flaming fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces. It was not long before he was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by one of the workmen, who aſked him,
<figure>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:030190_0020_0FE50440EBAD51F8"/>
               </figure>
roughly, what buſineſs he had there? Jack an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with great humility, that he was a poor boy, looking out for work; that he had had no food all day, and was wet to the ſkin with the rain, which was evident enough from the appearance of his cloaths. By great good luck, the man he ſpoke to was good-natured, and therefore not only permitted him to ſtay by the fire, but gave him ſome broken victuals for his ſupper. After this, he laid himſelf down in a corner, and ſlept without diſturbance till morning. He was ſcarcely awake the next day, when the maſter of the forge came in to overlook his men, who finding Jack, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſtory, began to reproach him as a lazy vagabond, and aſked him why he did not work for his living. Jack aſſured him there was nothing he ſo earneſtly deſired, and that if he would pleaſe to employ him, there was nothing
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030190_0021_0FE503DBA3B1BDB8"/>
that he would not do to earn a ſubſiſtence. Well, my boy, ſaid the maſter, if this is true, you ſhall ſoon be tried; nobody need be idle here; ſo calling his foreman, he ordered him to ſet that lad to work, and pay him in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to his deſerts. Jack now thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf completely happy, and worked with ſo much aſſiduity, that he ſoon gained a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable livelihood, and acquired the eſteem of his maſter. But unfortunately, he was a little too unreſerved in his converſation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the ſtory of his former life and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. This was great matter of diverſion to all the other boys of the forge; who, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were inclined to be merry, would call him little Jack the beggar-boy, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the baaing of a goat. This was too much for his iraſcible temper, and he never failed to reſent it; by which means he was engaged in continual quarrels and combats, to the great diſturbance of the houſe; ſo that his maſter, though in other reſpects perfectly ſatisfied with his behaviour, began to fear that he ſhould at laſt be obliged to diſcharge him.</p>
            <p>It happened one day, that a large company of gentlemen and ladies were introduced to ſee the works. The maſter attended them, and explained, with great politeneſs, every part of his manufacture. They viewed with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the different methods by which that uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and neceſſary ore of iron is rendered ſit for human uſe. They examined the furnaces where it is melted down, to diſengage it from the droſs, with which it is mixed in the bowels of the earth, and whence it runs down in liquid
<figure>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:030190_0022_0FE50442EBD14518"/>
               </figure>
torrents like fire. They beheld with equal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the prodigious hammers which, moved by the force of water, mould it into maſſy bars, for the ſervice of man. While they were buſy in examining theſe different proceſſes, they were alarmed by a ſudden noiſe of diſcord, which broke out on the other ſide of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the maſter inquiring into the cauſe, was told, that it was only little Jack, who was fighting with Tom the collier. At this, the maſter cried out, in a paſſion, there is no peace to be expected in the furnace, while that little raſcal is employed; ſend him to me, and I will inſtantly diſcharge him. At this moment Jack appeared, all covered with blood and dirt, and ſtood before his angry judge in a modeſt, but reſolute poſture. "Is this the reward, ſaid his maſter, you little audacious vagabond, of all my kindneſs? Can you never refrain a ſingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<figure>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:030190_0023_0FE503E350B8A7A8"/>
               </figure>
from broils and fighting? But I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to bear it no longer; and therefore you ſhall never, from this hour, do a ſingle ſtroke of work for me." "Sir, replied Jack, with great humility, but yet with firmneſs, I am extremely ſorry to have diſobliged you, nor have I ever done it willingly, ſince I have been here; and if the other boys would only mind their buſineſs as well as I do, and not moleſt me, you would not have been offended now; for I defy them all to ſay, that ſince I have been in the houſe, I have ever given any one the leaſt provocation, or ever refuſed to the utmoſt of my ſtrength, to do whatever I have been ordered." "That's true, in good faith, ſaid the foreman; I muſt do little Jack the juſtice to ſay that there is not a more honeſt, ſober, and induſtrious lad about the place. Set him to what you will, he never ſculks, never grumbles, never ſlights his work;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030190_0024_0FE50444740B6128"/>
and if it were not for a little paſſion and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I don't believe there would be his fellow in England." "Well, ſaid the maſter a little molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but what is the cauſe of all this ſudden diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance?" "Sir, anſwered Jack, it is Tom that has been abuſing me and telling me that my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was a beggarman and my mother a nanny-goat; and when I deſired him to be quiet, he went baaing all about the houſe; and this I could not bear; for as to my poor father he was an honeſt ſoldier, and if I did ſuck a goat, ſhe was the beſt creature in the world, and I won't hear her abuſed while I have any ſtrength in my body." At this harangue, the whole audience were ſcarcely able to refrain from laughing, and the maſter, with more compoſure, told Jack to mind his buſineſs, and threatened the other boys with puniſhment, if they diſturbed him.</p>
            <p>But a lady who was in company ſeemed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly intereſted about little Jack, and when ſhe had heard his ſtory, ſaid, this muſt certainly be the little boy who opened a gate ſeveral years paſt for me upon Norcot Moor. I remember being ſtruck with his appearance, and hearing him lament the loſs of the goat that nurſed him. I was very much affected with his hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and ſince he deſerves ſo good a character, if you will part with him, I will inſtantly take him into my ſervice. The maſter replied, that he ſhould part with him with great ſatisfaction to ſuch an excellent miſtreſs; that indeed the boy deſerved all the commendations which had been given; but ſince the other lads had ſuch an habit of plaguing, and Jack was of ſo impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient a temper, he deſpaired of ever compoſing
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030190_0025_0FE503E617AB5B50"/>
their animoſities. Jack was then called, and informed of the lady's offer, which he inſtantly accepted with the greateſt readineſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived immediate directions to her houſe.</p>
            <p>Jack was now in a new ſphere of life. His face was waſhed, his hair combed, he was clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed afreſh, and appeared a very ſmart active lad. His buſineſs was, to help in the ſtable, to water the horſes, to clean ſhoes, to perform errands, and to do all the jobs of the family; and in the diſcharge of theſe ſervices, he ſoon gave univerſal ſatisfaction. He was indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable in doing what he was ordered, never grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, or appeared out of temper, and ſeemed ſo quiet and inoffenſive in his manners, that every body wondered how he had acquired the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of being quarrelſome. In a ſhort time, he became both the favourite and the drudge of the whole family; for, ſpeak but kindly to him and call him a little ſoldier, and Jack was at every one's diſpoſal. This was Jack's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular foible and vanity; at his leiſure hours, he would divert himſelf by the hour together, in poizing a dung fork, charging with a broom ſtick, and ſtanding centry at the ſtable door. Another propenſity of Jack's, which now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered itſelf, was an immoderate love of horſes. The inſtant he was introduced into the ſtable, he attached himſelf ſo ſtrongly to theſe animals, that you would have taken him for one of the ſame ſpecies, or at leaſt a near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Jack was never tired with rubbing down and currying them; the coachman had ſcarcely any buſineſs but to ſit upon his box; all the operations of the ſtable were intruſted to little
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030190_0026_0FE504470C7AE688"/>
Jack, nor was it ever known that he neglected a ſingle particular. But what gave him more pleaſure than all the reſt, was ſometimes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company his miſtreſs upon a little horſe, which he managed with infinite dexterity.</p>
            <p>Jack too diſcovered a great diſpoſition for all the uſeful and mechanic arts. He had ſerved an apprenticeſhip already to the manufactory of iron, and of this he was almoſt as vain as being a ſoldier. As he began to extend his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the world, he ſaw that nothing could be done without iron. How would you plough the ground, ſaid Jack; how would you dig your garden; how would you even light a fire, dreſs a dinner, ſhoe a horſe, or do the leaſt thing in the world, if we workmen at the forge did not take the trouble of preparing it for you? Thus Jack would ſometimes expatiate upon the dignity and importance of his own profeſſion, to the great admiration of all the other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
            <p>Theſe ideas naturally gave Jack a great eſteem for the profeſſion of a blackſmith, and in his occaſional viſits to the forge with the horſes, he learnt to make and fix a ſhoe as neatly as any artiſt in the country.</p>
            <p>Nor were Jack's talents confined to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactory of iron; his love of horſes was ſo great, and his intereſt in every thing that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, that it was not long before he acquired a very competent knowledge in the art of ſaddlery.</p>
            <p>Jack would alſo ſometimes obſerve the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters when they were at work, and ſometimes by ſtealth attempt the management of their
<figure>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:030190_0027_0FE503E7A0FFD0A0"/>
               </figure>
tools; in which he ſucceeded as well as in every thing elſe; ſo that he was looked upon by every body as a very active, ingenious boy.</p>
            <p>There was in the family, where he now lived, a young gentleman, the nephew of his miſtreſs, who had loſt his parents, and was therefore brought up by his aunt. As Maſter Willets was ſomething younger than Jack, and a very good-natured boy, he ſoon began to take notice of him, and be much diverted with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Jack, indeed, was not undeſerving this attention; for although he could not boaſt any great advantages of education, his conduct was entirely free from all the vices to which ſome of the lower claſs of people are ſubject. Jack was never heard to ſwear, or expreſs himſelf with any indecency. He was civil and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his manners to all his ſuperiors, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly good-natured to his equals. In reſpect
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030190_0028_0FE5045321639F68"/>
to the animals entruſted to his care, he not only refrained from uſing them ill, but was never tired with doing them good offices. Add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this, he was ſober, temperate, hardy, active, and ingenious, and deſpiſed a lie as much as any of his betters. Maſter Willets now began to be much pleaſed with playing at cric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket and trap-ball with Jack, who excelled at both theſe games. Maſter Willets had a little horſe which Jack looked after; and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with looking after him in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he uſed to ride him at his leiſure hours with ſo much care and addreſs, that in a ſhort time he made him the moſt gentle and docile little animal in the country. Jack had acquired this knowledge partly from his own experience, and partly from paying particular attention to an itinerant riding-maſter that had lately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited various feats in that neighbourhood. Jack attended him ſo cloſely, and made ſo good

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:030190_0029_0FE503EA53817C08"/>
an uſe of his time, that he learned to imitate almoſt every thing he ſaw, and uſed to divert the ſervants and his young maſter with acting the tailor's riding to Brentford.</p>
            <p>The young gentleman had a maſter who uſed to come three times a week to teach him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and writing, and geography. Jack uſed to be ſometimes in the room while the leſſons were given, and liſtened according to cuſtom with ſo much attention to all that paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he received very conſiderable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for his own improvement. He had now a little money, and he laid ſome of it out to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe pens and paper and a ſlate, with which at night he uſed to imitate every thing he had heard and ſeen in the day: and his little maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who began to love him very ſincerely, when he ſaw him ſo deſirous of improvement, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, under one pretence or another, to have him generally in the room while he was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtruction himſelf.</p>
            <p>In this manner Jack went on for ſome years, leading a life very agreeable to himſelf, and diſcharging his duty very much to the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his miſtreſs. An unlucky accident at length happened to interrupt his tranquility. A young gentleman came down to viſit Maſter. Willets, who, having been educated in France, and among genteel people in London, had a very great taſte for finery, and a ſupreme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for all the vulgar. His dreſs too was a little particular, as well as his manners; for he ſpent half his time in adjuſting his head, wore a large black bag tied to his hair behind, and would ſometimes ſtrut about for half an hour together
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030190_0030_0FE50454B929CDE8"/>
with his hat under his arm, and a little ſword
<figure/>
by his ſide. This young man had a ſupreme contempt for all the vulgar, which he did not attempt to conceal; and when he had heard the ſtory of Jack's birth and education, he could ſcarcely bear to be in the ſame room with him. Jack ſoon perceived the averſion which the ſtranger entertained for him, and at firſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to remove it, by every civility in his power; but when he found that he gained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by all his humility, his temper, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally haughty, took fire, and, as far as he dared, he plainly ſhowed all the reſentment he felt.</p>
            <p>It happened one day, after Jack had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome very mortifying uſage from this young gentleman, that as he was walking along the road, he met with a ſhowman, who was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a neighbouring fair with ſome wild
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030190_0031_0FE503EF76BB8538"/>
beaſts in a cart. Among the reſt was a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſized monkey, who was not under cover like the reſt, and played ſo many antic tricks, and made ſo many grimaces, as engaged all Jack's attention, and delighted him very much, for he always had a propenſity for every ſpecies of drollery. After a variety of queſtions and converſation, the ſhowman, who probably wanted to be rid of his monkey, propoſed to Jack to purchaſe him for half a crown. Jack could not reſiſt the temptation of being maſter of ſuch a droll diverting animal, and therefore agreed to the bargain. But when he was left alone with his purchaſe, whom he led along by a chain, he ſoon began to repent his haſte, and knew not how to diſpoſe of him. As there was however, no remedy, Jack brought him carefully home, and confined him ſafe in an out-houſe, which was not applied to any uſe. In this ſituation he kept him ſeveral days, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out accident, and frequently viſited him at his leiſure hours, with apples, nuts, and ſuch other preſents as he could procure. Among the other tricks which the monkey had been taught to perform, he would riſe upon his hind legs at the word of command, and bow with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt politeneſs to the company. Jack, who had found out theſe accompliſhments in his friend, could not reſiſt the impulſe of making them ſubſervient to his reſentment. He, therefore, one day, procured ſome flour, with which he powdered his monkey's head, fixed a large paper bag to his neck, put an old hat under his arm, and tied a large iron ſkewer to his ſide, inſtead of a ſword; and thus accoutred led him about
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030190_0032_0FE50456684599D0"/>
with infinite ſatisfaction, calling him Monſieur, and jabbering ſuch broken French as he had picked up from the converſation of the viſitor. It happened very unluckily at this very inſtant, that the young gentleman himſelf paſſed by, and inſtantly ſaw at one glance the intended copy of himſelf, and all the malice of little Jack; who was leading him along, and calling
<figure/>
to him to hold up his head and look like a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of faſhion. Rage inſtantly took poſſeſſion of his mind, and drawing his ſword, which he happened to have on, he ran the poor monkey through with a ſudden thruſt, and laid him dead upon the ground. What more he might have done is uncertain, for Jack, who was not of a temper to ſee calmly ſuch an outrage com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon an animal whom he conſidered as his friend, flew upon him like a fury, and wreſting the ſword out of his hand, broke it
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030190_0033_0FE503F2519A60D0"/>
into twenty pieces. The young gentleman himſelf received a fall in the ſcuffle, which, though it did him no material damage, daubed all his cloaths, and totally ſpoiled the whole
<figure/>
arrangement of his dreſs. At this inſtant, the lady herſelf, who had heard the noiſe, came down, and the violence of poor Jack was too apparent to be excuſed. Jack, indeed, was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive to his miſtreſs, whom he was very ſorry to have offended; but, when he was ordered to make conceſſions to the young gentleman, as the only conditions upon which he could be kept in the family, he abſolutely refuſed. He owned, indeed, that he was much to blame for reſenting the provocations he had received, and endeavouring to make his miſtreſs's company ridiculous; but as to what he had done in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his friend the monkey, there were no poſſible arguments which could convince him
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030190_0034_0FE504580EE8A680"/>
he was in the leaſt to blame; nor would he have made ſubmiſſions to the king himſelf. This unfortunate obſtinacy of Jack's was the occaſion of his being diſcharged, very much to the regret of the lady herſelf, and ſtill more to that of Maſter Willets. Jack therefore packed up his cloaths in a little bundle, ſhook all his fellow-ſervants by the hand, took an affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate leave of his kind maſter, and once more ſallied out upon his travels.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>He had not walked far before he came to a town, where a party of ſoldiers were beating up for volunteers. Jack mingled with the crowd that ſurrounded the recruiting ſerjeant, and liſtened with great pleaſure to the ſound of the fifes and drums; nor could he help mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically holding up his head, and ſtepping for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with an air that ſhowed the trade was not entirely new to him. The ſerjeant ſoon took
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030190_0035_0FE503F3DC5ECD58"/>
notice of theſe geſtures, and ſeeing him a ſtrong likely lad, came up to him, clapped him upon the back, and aſked him if he would enliſt? "You are a brave boy, ſaid he, I can ſee it in
<figure/>
your looks—come along with us, and I don't doubt in a few weeks, you'll be as complete a ſoldier as thoſe who have been in the army for years." Jack made no anſwer to this, but by inſtantly poizing his ſtick, cocking his hat fiercely, and going through the whole manuel exerciſe.—"Prodigious, indeed, cried the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant, I ſee you have been in the army already, and can eat fire as well as any of us. But come with us, my brave lad, you ſhall live well, have little to do, but now and then fight for your king and country, as every gentleman ought; and in a ſhort time, I don't doubt but I ſhall ſee you a captain, or ſome great man, rolling in wealth, which you have got out of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030190_0036_0FE50461A6DD62F8"/>
the ſpoils of your enemies."—"No, ſaid Jack, captain, that will never do—no tricks upon travellers—I know better what I have to expect if I enliſt—I muſt lie hard, live hard, expoſe my life and limbs, every hour of the day, and be ſoundly cudgelled every now and then into the bargain."—"O'ons, cried the ſerjeant, where did the young dog pick up all this? He is enough to make a whole company deſert."—"No, ſaid Jack, they ſhall never deſert through me; for though I know this, as I am at preſent out of employment, and have a great reſpect for the character of a gentleman ſoldier, I will enliſt directly in your regiment." "A brave fellow, indeed, ſaid the ſerjeant; here, my boy, here is your money and your cockade, both which he directly preſented, for fear his recruit ſhould change his mind; and thus in a moment little Jack became a ſoldier.</p>
            <p>He had ſcarcely time to feel himſelf eaſy in his new accoutrements, before he was embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for India in the character of a marine. This kind of life was entirely new to Jack; however, his uſual activity and ſpirit of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not deſert him here, and he had not been embarked many weeks, before he was perfectly acquainted with all the duty of a ſailor, and in that reſpect equal to moſt on board. It happened that the ſhip, in which he ſailed, touched at the Cormo Iſlands, in order to take in wood and water; theſe are ſome little iſlands near the coaſt of Africa, inhabited by blacks. Jack often went on ſhore with the officers, attending them on their ſhooting parties to carry their powder and ſhot, and the game they killed.
<figure>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:030190_0037_0FE503F6D1E50630"/>
               </figure>
All this country conſiſts of very lofty hills, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with trees and ſhrubs of various kinds, which never loſe their leaves, from the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual warmth of the climate. Through theſe it is frequently difficult to force a way, and the hills themſelves abound in precipices. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that one of the officers whom Jack was attending upon a ſhooting party, took aim at ſome great bird and brought it down; but as it fell into ſome deep valley, over ſome rocks which it was impoſſible to deſcend, they deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of gaining their prey. Jack, immediately, with officious haſte, ſet off and ran down the more level ſide of the hill, thinking to make a circuit and reach the valley into which the bird had fallen. He ſet off, therefore, but as he was totally ignorant of the country, he, in a ſhort time, buried himſelf ſo deep in the wood, which grew continually thicker, that he knew
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030190_0038_0FE504643189E280"/>
not which way to proceed. He then thought it moſt prudent to return; but this he found as difficult to effect as the other. He therefore wandered about the woods with inconceivable difficulty all day, but could never find his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany nor even reach the ſhore, or obtain the proſpect of the ſea. At length the night ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and Jack, who perceived it to be impoſſible to do that in the dark, which he had not been able to effect in the light, lay down under a rock, and compoſed himſelf to reſt, as well as he was able. The next day he roſe with the light, and once more attempted to regain the ſhore: but unfortunately he had totally loſt all idea of the direction he ought to purſue, and ſaw nothing around him but the diſmal proſpect of woods and hills and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices, without a guide or path. Jack now began to be very hungry, but as he had a fowling piece with him, and powder and ſhot, he ſoon
<figure/>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:030190_0039_0FE503FDCE284868"/>
procured himſelf a dinner; and kindling a fire with ſome dry leaves and ſticks, he roaſted his game upon the embers, and dined as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably as he could be expected to do in ſo forlorn a ſituation. Finding himſelf much refreſhed, he purſued his journey, but with as little ſucceſs as ever. On the third day, he indeed came in ſight of the ſea, but found that he was quite on a different ſide of the iſland from that where he left the ſhip, and that neither ſhip nor boat was to be ſeen. Jack now loſt all hopes of rejoining his comrades, for he knew the ſhip was to ſail at fartheſt upon the third day, and would not wait for him. He, therefore, ſat down very penſively upon a rock, and caſt his eyes upon the vaſt extent of ocean which was ſtretched out before him. He found himſelf now abandoned upon a ſtrange country, without a ſingle friend, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, or even any one who ſpoke the ſame language. He at firſt thought of ſeeking out the natives, and making known to them his deplorable ſtate; but he began to fear the reception he might meet with among them. They might not be pleaſed, he thought, with his company, and might take the liberty of treating him as the white men generally treat the blacks when they get them into their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; that is, make him work hard with very little victuals, and knock him on the head if he attempted to run away. And therefore, ſays Jack, as he was meditating all alone, it may, perhaps, be better for me to ſtay quiet where I am. It is true, indeed, I ſhall not have much company to talk to, but then I ſhall
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030190_0040_0FE50465BB9904E0"/>
have nobody to quarrel with me, or baa, or laugh at my poor daddy and mammy. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I at preſent ſee how I ſhall get a liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, when my powder and ſhot are all expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but however I ſhall hardly be ſtarved, for I ſaw ſeveral kinds of fruit in the woods, and ſome roots which look very much like carrots. As to cloaths, when mine wear out, I ſhall not much want new ones; for the weather is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly warm; and therefore, all things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, I don't ſee why I ſhould not be as happy here as in any other place.—When Jack had finiſhed his ſpeech, he ſet himſelf to find a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the night. He had not examined far before he found a dry cavern in a rock, which he thought would prove a very comfortable reſidence; he therefore went to work with an hatchet he had with him, and cut ſome boughs of trees, which he ſpread upon the floor, and over thoſe a long ſilky kind of graſs, which he found in plenty near the place, to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a bed. His next care was, how to ſecure himſelf in caſe of any attack, for he did not know whether the iſland contained any wild beaſts or not. He therefore cut down ſeveral branches of trees, and wove them into a kind of wicker work, as he had ſeen the men do hurdles when he lived with the farmer; with this contrivance he found he could very ſecurely barricade the entrance of his cave. And now, as the evening was again approaching, he began to feel himſelf hungry, and ſeeking along the ſea-ſhore, he found ſome ſhell-fiſh, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied him with a plentiful meal. The next day Jack aroſe, a little melancholy indeed, but,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030190_0041_0FE503FF5B19F530"/>
with a reſolution to ſtruggle manfully with the difficulties of his ſituation. He walked into the woods and ſaw ſeveral kinds of fruit and berries, ſome of which he ventured to eat, as the birds had pecked them, and found the taſte agreeable. He alſo dug up ſeveral ſpecies of roots, but feared to taſte them leſt they ſhould be poiſonous. At length, he ſelected one that very much reſembled a potatoe, and determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to roaſt it in the embers, and taſte a very ſmall bit. It can hardly, thought Jack, do me much hurt, in ſo very ſmall a quantity; and if that agrees with me I will increaſe the doſe. The root was fortunately extremely wholeſome and nutritive, ſo that Jack was in a very ſhort time tolerably ſecure againſt the danger of wanting food. In this manner did Jack lead a kind of ſavage, but tolerably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented life, for ſeveral months; during which time he enjoyed perfect health, and was never diſcovered by any of the natives. He uſed ſeveral times a day to viſit the ſhore, in hopes that ſome ſhip might paſs that way and deliver him from his ſolitary impriſonment. This, at length, happened, by the boat of an Engliſh ſhip, that was ſailing to India, happening to touch upon the coaſt; Jack inſtantly hailed the crew, and the officer, upon hearing the ſtory, agreed to receive him; the captain too, when he found that Jack was by no means a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible ſailor, very willingly gave him his paſſage, and promiſed him a gratuity beſides, if he behaved well.</p>
            <p>Jack arrived in India without any accident, and relating his ſtory, was permitted to ſerve
<figure>
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:030190_0042_0FE5046868AC4AE0"/>
               </figure>
in another regiment as his own was no longer there. He ſoon diſtinguiſhed himſelf by his courage and good behaviour on ſeveral occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and before long was advanced to the rank of a ſerjeant. In this capacity, he was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out upon an expedition into the remote parts of the country. The little army in which he ſerved now marched on for ſeveral weeks, through a burning climate, and in want of all the neceſſaries of life. At length, they entered upon ſome extenſive plains, which bordered upon the celebrated country of the Tartars. Jack was perfectly well acquainted with the hiſtory of this people, and their method of fighting. He knew them to be ſome of the beſt horſemen in the world indefatigable in their attacks, though often repulſed returning to the charge, and not to be invaded with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity; he, therefore, took the liberty of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030190_0043_0FE50400E3B9FB18"/>
to ſome of the officers, that nothing could be more dangerous than their raſhly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging themſelves in thoſe extenſive plains, where they were every moment expoſed to the attacks of cavalry, without any ſucceſsful me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<figure/>
of defence, or place of retreat, in caſe of any misfortune. Theſe remonſtrances were not much attended to, and after a few hours farther march, they were alarmed by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of a conſiderable body of Tartar horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. They, however, drew up with all the order they were able, and firing ſeveral ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive vollies, endeavoured to keep the enemy at a diſtance. But the Tartars had no deſign of doing that with a conſiderable loſs, which they were ſure of doing with eaſe and ſafety. Inſtead therefore of charging the Europeans, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themſelves with giving continual alarms, and menacing them on every ſide, without
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030190_0044_0FE50472412EC7B8"/>
expoſing themſelves to any conſiderable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. The army now attempted to retreat, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that they ſhould be able to arrive at the neighbouring mountains, where they would be ſafe from the incurſions of the horſe. But in this attempt they were equally diſappointed; for another conſiderable body of enemies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on that ſide, and blocked their paſſage. The Europeans now found they were ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all ſides, and that reſiſtance was vain. The commanding officer, therefore, judged it expedient to try what could be effected by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation, and ſent one of his officers, who underſtood ſomething of the Tartar language, to treat with the general of the enemies. The Tartar chief received the Europeans with great civility, and after having gently reproached them with their ambition, in coming ſo far to invade a people who had never injured them, he conſented upon very moderate conditions to their enlargement: but he inſiſted upon having their arms delivered up, except a very few which he permitted them to keep for defence in their return, and upon retaining a certain number of Europeans as hoſtages for the performance of the ſtipulated articles. Among thoſe who were thus left with the Tartars, Jack happened to be included, and while all the reſt ſeemed incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolable at being thus made priſoners by a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous nation, he alone, accuſtomed to all the viciſſitudes of life, retained his cheerfulneſs, and prepared to meet every reverſe of fortune with his uſual firmneſs.</p>
            <p>The Tartars, among whom Jack was now to reſide, conſtitute ſeveral different tribes or
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030190_0045_0FE504039E3450A8"/>
nations which inhabit an immenſe extent of country both in Europe and Aſia. Their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is in general open and uncultivated, with out cities or towns, ſuch as we ſee in England. The inhabitants themſelves are a bold and hardy race of men that live in ſmall tents, and change their place of abode with the different ſeaſons of the year. All their property conſiſts in herds of cattle, which they drive along with them from place to place; and upon whoſe milk and fleſh they ſubſiſt. They are particularly fond of horſes, of which they have a ſmall but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent breed, hardy and indefatigable for the purpoſes of war, and they excel in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, beyond what is eaſy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Immenſe herds of theſe animals wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der looſe about the deſerts, but marked with the particular mark of the perſon or tribe to which they belong. When they want any of theſe animals for uſe, a certain number of their young men jump upon their horſes with nothing but an halter to guide them, each carrying in his hand a pole with a nooſe or cord at the end. When they come in ſight of the herd, they purſue the horſe they wiſh to take at full ſpeed, come up with him in ſpite of his ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and never fail to throw the nooſe about his neck as he runs. They are frequently known to jump upon young horſes that have paſſed their whole life in the deſert, and with only a girt around the animal's body to hold by, maintain their ſeat, in ſpite of all his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent exertions, until they have wearied him out and reduced him into perfect obedience. Such was the nation with whom the lot of Jack
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030190_0046_0FE504740D42D620"/>
was now to reſide, nor was he long before he had an opportunity of ſhowing his talents.</p>
            <p>It happened that a favourite horſe of the chief was taken with a violent fever, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be in immediate danger of death. The khan, for ſo he is called among the Tartars, ſeeing his horſe grow hourly worſe, at length applied to the Europeans, to know if they could ſuggeſt any thing for his recovery. All the officers were profoundly ignorant of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riery; but when the application was made to Jack, he deſired to ſee the horſe, and with great gravity began to feel his pulſe, by paſſing his hand within the animal's fore-leg; which gave the Tartars a very high idea of his ingenuity. Finding that the animal was in a high fever, he propoſed to the khan to let him blood, which he had learned to do very dexterouſly in England. He obtained permiſſion to do as he pleaſed, and having by great good luck a lancet
<figure/>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:030190_0047_0FE5040E1B749080"/>
with him, he let him blood very dexterouſly in the neck. After this operation he covered him up, and gave him a warm potion made out of ſuch ingredients as he could procure upon the ſpot, and left him quiet. In a few hours the horſe began to mend, and, to the great joy of the khan, perfectly recovered in a few days. This cure, ſo opportunely perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, raiſed the reputation of Jack ſo high, that every body came to conſult him about their horſes, and in a ſhort time he was the univerſal farrier of the tribe. The khan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf conceived ſo great an affection for him, that he gave him an excellent horſe to ride upon and attend him in his hunting parties; and Jack, who excelled in the art of horſemanſhip, managed him ſo well as to gain the eſteem of the whole nation.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:030190_0048_0FE50475D0F92B48"/>
The Tartars, though they are excellent horſemen, have no idea of managing their horſes, unleſs by violence; but Jack in a ſhort time, by continual care and attention, made his horſe ſo docile and obedient to every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his hand and leg, that the Tartars themſelves would gaze upon him with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and allow themſelves to be out-done. Not contented with this, he procured ſome iron, and made his horſe-ſhoes in the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean taſte; this alſo was matter of aſtoniſhment to all the Tartars, who are accuſtomed to ride their horſes unſhod. He next obſerved that the Tartar ſaddles are all prodigiouſly large and cumberſome, raiſing the horſemen up to a great diſtance from the back of his horſe. Jack ſet himſelf to work, and was not long before he had completed ſomething like an Engliſh hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaddle, on which he paraded before the khan. All mankind ſeem to have a paſſion for novelty, and the khan was ſo delighted with this effort of Jack's ingenuity, that, after paying him the higheſt compliments, he intimated a deſire of having ſuch a ſaddle for himſelf. Jack was the moſt obliging creature in the world, and ſpared no labour to ſerve his friends; he went to work again, and in a ſhort time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted a ſaddle ſtill more elegant for the khan. Theſe exertions gained him the favour and eſteem both of the khan and all the tribe; ſo that Jack was an univerſal favourite and loaded with preſents, while all the reſt of the officers, who had never learned to make a ſaddle or an horſe-ſhoe, were treated with contempt and indifference. Jack, indeed, behaved with the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030190_0049_0FE50410219CFEE8"/>
greateſt generoſity to his countrymen, and divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them all the mutton and veniſon which were given him; but he could not help ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times obſerving, that it was great pity they had not learned to make an horſe-ſhoe inſtead of dancing and dreſſing hair.</p>
            <p>And now an ambaſſador arrived from the Engliſh ſettlements, with an account that all the conditions of the treaty had been perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and demanding the reſtitution of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. The Tartar chief was too much a man of honour to delay an inſtant, and they were all reſtored; but before they ſet out, Jack laboured with indefatigable zeal to finiſh a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſaddles and a dozen horſe-ſhoes, which he preſented to the khan, with many expreſſions of gratitude. The khan was charmed with this proof of his affection, and in return made him a preſent of a couple of fine horſes, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral valuable ſkins of beaſts. Jack arrived without any accident at the Engliſh ſettlements, and ſelling his ſkins and horſes, found himſelf in poſſeſſion of a moderate ſum of money. He now began to have a deſire to return to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and one of the officers, who had often been obliged to him during his captivity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him a diſcharge. He embarked, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with all his property, on board a ſhip, which was returning home, and in a few months was ſafely landed at Plymouth.</p>
            <p>But Jack was too active and too prudent to give himſelf up to idleneſs. After conſidering various ſchemes of buſineſs, he determined to take up his old trade of forging; and for that purpoſe made a journey into the North, and

               </figure>
found his old maſter alive, and as active as ever. His maſter, who had always entertained an eſteem for Jack, welcomed him with great affection, and being in want of a foreman, he engaged him at a very handſome price, for that place. Jack was now indefatigable in the execution of his new office; inflexibly honeſt where the intereſts of his maſter were concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and at the ſame time humane and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the men who were under him, he gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the affection of all about him. In a few years, his maſter was ſo thoroughly convinced of his merit, that growing old himſelf, he took Jack into partnerſhip, and committed the management of the whole buſineſs to his care. He continued to exert the ſame qualities now which he had done before, by which means he improved the buſineſs ſo much, as to gain a conſiderable fortune, and become one of the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030190_0051_0FE50477590DC1E0"/>
moſt reſpectable manufacturers in the country.—But, with all this proſperity, he never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the leaſt pride or haughtineſs; on the contrary, he employed part of his fortune to purchaſe the moor where he formerly lived, and built himſelf a ſmall but convenient houſe, upon the very ſpot where his daddy's hut had formerly ſtood. Hither he would ſometimes retire from buſineſs, and cultivate his garden with his own hands, for he hated idleneſs.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>To all his poor neighbours he was kind and liberal, relieving them in their diſtreſs, and often entertaining them at his houſe, where he uſed to dine with them, with the greateſt affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,

            <head>THE LITTLE QUEEN.</head>
            <p>THERE reigned once upon a time, in a diſtant iſland, a good prince who was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately beloved by all his ſubjects. It could not happen otherwiſe, for he was their common father. He provided for all their reaſonable wants, he rewarded thoſe who deſerved well of their country, and he let none of the wicked, nor even of the idle, eſcape without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This amiable monarch had but one cauſe of anxiety; Myra, his only child, by no means requited the attention which had been given to her education. At twelve years of age ſhe was ſhamefully ignorant. Her thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs made her forget every leſſon which ſhe had been taught, and her preſumption kept pace with her want of knowledge; of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence as ſhe thought herſelf perfectly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, ſhe deſpiſed all inſtruction. One day
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030190_0053_0FE504820B96FAE0"/>
ſhe was indulging her abſurd vanity by hinting, that were ſhe to govern the iſland, things would be better managed than they were now. The King, having been informed of his daughter's ſentiments, ſent for her immediately. On her coming, he told her, without the leaſt diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, <q>That as ſhe was deſtined to reign, one day or other, over his kingdoms, he ſhould wiſh to know how far her talents were proper for ſo important a charge. "We may, if you pleaſe," added this good prince, make the experiment without any delay. Careleſs as you always were about the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which have been given you in geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, you cannot but know that <hi>The Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Iſland</hi> makes a part of my dominions; it is a ſmall, but well inhabited diſtrict; its people are active, induſtrious, good tempered, and thoroughly attached to their ſovereigns. Go, child! reign over them, I ſhall order a yacht to be inſtantly fitted up to convey you to your capital.</q> Then making a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reverence to the little ſovereign, "Adieu, "madam," ſaid he, with difficulty concealing a ſmile.</p>
            <p>Myra, for ſome time, thought that the king meant only to divert himſelf, but ſoon found her miſtake, and that every thing was preparing for her voyage. She was even permitted to form a court to her mind, and accordingly ſhe picked out a dozen of her playfellows to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her. "Theſe young people," ſaid ſhe to her father, <q>are ſo very rational and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, that there can be no need of their being attended by governeſſes or tutors.</q> The
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:030190_0054_0FE504F94CB75F00"/>
king, however, thought otherwiſe, and ordered the teachers to embark with their pupils. The young ſovereign, on her part, took care there ſhould be abundance of muſicians for her balls, and that a company of players ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the amuſement of herſelf and her court. On the morn of her departure, ſhe took an affectionate leave of her father, but the few tears which ſhe ſhed, were ſoon dried up by the conſideration of her being going to a place where ſhe ſhould do "juſt what ſhe pleaſed." "The only advice that I ſhall give you," ſaid the king at parting, <q>is, that you would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the advice of Ariſtus (the governor of the iſland over which you are to reign) in every thing of importance. He is a man for whom I have a high eſteem, and with reaſon, as he is diſcreet, honeſt, and humane. I could wiſh that you would make him your firſt miniſter; I mean, that you ſhould conſult him in every thing, and entruſt him with the execution of all your orders.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This direction no way ſuited the taſte of our young Queen, who wiſhed to have given that important charge to one of her favourites, Philintus, a tall, genteel lad, not indeed many years older than herſelf, but one who, to to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable ſkill in dancing and ſinging, added the very agreeable talent of elegant flattery. He was himſelf as averſe to ſtudy, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence as ignorant as his royal miſtreſs; but he had knowledge enough of his own intereſt to excite him never to omit aſſuring her that every one looked on her as a model of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect princeſs, although he was conſcious that,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030190_0055_0FE50483EBD4BBD0"/>
out of her hearing, ſhe was univerſally blamed for being ſo totally unlike her excellent father, and for ſpending her whole time in trifling amuſements.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the little ſovereign reached her iſland, ſhe beheld with pleaſure troops of ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds and ſhepherdeſſes, in elegant fancy dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of roſe colour and white, who ſung carols in praiſe of their new Queen, ſtrewed ſweet ſcented flowers in her path, and preſented her with odoriferous noſegays. Myra, charmed with this ſpecimen of her ſubjects gallantry, ordered money to be diſtributed amongſt them; and, under the conduct of Ariſtus, repaired to a lovely, though ſmall palace, fitted up for her reception. Fatigued with the voyage, the Queen and her young court haſtened to their repoſe; but her Majeſty forgot not to order, for the next day, a comedy to be acted, followed by a ball and a ſplendid entertainment. On the next morn, Myra and her court amuſed themſelves by walking into the capital town, which lay not far from the palace. "Obſerve," ſaid Ariſtus to his ſovereign, <q>the air of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent which reigns in every face we meet.</q> "That," ſaid Philintus, <q>we ſhould attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the preſence of our lovely Queen.</q> "Without doubt," replied Ariſtus, <q>they are ſenſible of that honour; but I ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, that their gaiety is chiefly owing to their being conſcious of the excellent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under which they live, and of the wiſdom of thoſe laws by which their King, whom they look upon as their father, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the country.</q> "Let us now," ſaid
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030190_0056_0FE504FB61412730"/>
Myra, "extend our walks into the country." They did ſo. An orchard, in full bloom, now tempted her to take a nearer view of its beauty. "What," ſaid ſhe to Ariſtus, <q>occaſions the buzzing ſounds which I hear?</q> "The bees," replied he; <q>a uſeful tribe of your Majeſty's ſubjects.</q> At that inſtant, moſt unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, one of theſe animals, not perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the reſpect due to royalty, and diſguſted at the Queen's approaching too near to his hive, ſettled on her hand, and made her feel his ſting!—<q>Shocking creatures, theſe bees! exclaimed Myra; one of them has half killed me!</q> 
               <q>The preſumptuous, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful wretches ought, ſaid Philintus, to be utterly extirpated.</q> 
               <q>You are right, ſaid the Queen; I will have them deſtroyed, not on my own account, but to preſerve my poor people from receiving ſuch cruel wounds, when they are purſuing their occupations in the country.</q> 
               <q>Permit me, ſaid Ariſtus, to obſerve, that theſe accidents happen but very ſeldom, and that the pain which the bees occaſion by their ſtings, is trifling, when compared with the vaſt advantage which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues from their labours; your ſubjects, madam, will ſuffer ſeverely indeed, if they are deprived of that uſeful creature.</q>—Here he was interrupted by Philintus, who burſting with laughter, cried out, <q>A pretty tale you tell us, Ariſtus! why ſure you take us all for children! Suffer indeed! what! becauſe that naſty inſect is kept from ſtinging them! Make us believe <hi>that,</hi> if you can.</q> 
               <q>I will have every bee in my kingdom put to death,</q>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:030190_0057_0FE50485CCA89DA8"/>
ſaid the young Queen with an air of dignity. <q>Poſſibly, ſaid Ariſtus, your Majeſty may ſee cauſe hereafter to repent of this haſty command.</q> 
               <q>Nevertheleſs, repeated Myra, it <hi>ſhall</hi> be executed.</q> Ariſtus retired with a ſigh, and Philintus loudly applauded the ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led humanity and firmneſs of his infant ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. That evening the Queen entertained herſelf at the play, and afterwards was preſent at a ball, which, with a magnificent ſupper, laſted until two o'clock in the morning.</p>
            <p>Unluckily among the ladies of the bedcham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were two, who, not having reached their eleventh year, had been uſed to eat little or no ſuppers, to take moderate exerciſe, and to go to bed early. But the royal banquet had been ſo tempting, the ball ſo charming, and the whole ſo perfectly new to them, that they had deſpiſed the admonitions of their governeſſes, who had very naturally remonſtrated againſt their launching at once into this new ſyſtem. In conſequence, they were both extremely ill the next morning. The phyſician attended, and ordered proper medicines, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to take. <q>They were permitted by the Queen, they ſaid, to do what they liked beſt, and they hated naſty phyſic.</q> Their complaints, however, increaſed; they could neither eat, drink, or ſleep, and one of the two felt the attack of a fever. On this the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſſes were obliged to have recourſe to the royal authority, and the Queen having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the young ladies to ſubmit to diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, they took what was ordered and all went right again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:030190_0058_0FE5050C46341AB0"/>
One day that the young Queen was walking in the garden of her palace, ſhe was diſguſted at the devaſtation which had been made by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars on the leaves of the trees. <q>What vile creatures are theſe!</q> ſaid ſhe to Philin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus: <q>Did you ever ſee ſuch a piece of work as they have made here?</q> 
               <q>I think, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the courtier, that it would be a good deed to root them out of the iſland, and to proclaim rewards for thoſe who would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to deſtroy them.</q> 
               <q>What ſay you to that, Ariſtus, ſaid Myra, can my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects exiſt without caterpillars?</q> 
               <q>Your Majeſty, replied Ariſtus, has not forgot the bees, I find, but here the caſe is widely different. The caterpillars which have ſtript thoſe trees do much miſchief, and are of no one uſe to ſociety.</q> 
               <q>I am heartily glad, ſaid the Queen, that we coincide in opinion, for I am determined to have all the cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillars in my dominions deſtroyed; I hate them, naſty creatures!</q> 
               <q>Your Majeſty ſaid Ariſtus, certainly means to except from this general maſſacre, that kind of caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar which produces the ſilk-worm.</q> 
               <q>Do but hear him,</q> ſaid Philintus, in the Queen's ear; <q>that fellow makes a point of contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Majeſty in every thing.</q> 
               <q>Let every caterpillar in my realm be put to death,</q> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the piqued ſovereign.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am tired to death,</q> ſaid Myra, one day,<q> of this eternal verdure. Theſe walks of turf, and theſe clumps of laurel, though I like them well enough on the whole, yet being repeated ſo often, they fatigue my eyes;—
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030190_0059_0FE504875598A7F0"/>
green, and green, and nothing but green—Why can I not have a roſe-colour bower?</q> Philintus now turned all his thoughts towards the accompliſhment of his ſovereign's rational wiſh. He had obſerved in a diſtant part of the garden an arbour where a honeyſuckle overſpread the green frame work. He ordered the leaves to be ſtripped off, the wood to be painted roſe colour, and he covered the whole with artificial roſes hanging by crimſon rib-bands. The Queen was enchanted with this gaudy retreat, and as ſoon as ſhe ſaw it, ordered her dinner to be ſet out upon that very ſpot. The ſun ſhone out with great power, and ſcarce had the company ſate ten minutes at their meal, before ſome complained of aching heads, ſome of dazzled eyes; all loſt their appetites, and the whole was a confuſion of heat and glare. Ariſtus adviſed the whole party to abandon the flaring ſcene, and to refreſh their eyes by gazing on the turf in ſome ſhady place. They did ſo, and all went well again. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, it was ſettled by her Majeſty in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that, during the ſummer, it were better for the leaves of the trees to be green, than to be roſe colour.</p>
            <p>Myra was ſo enchanted with the pleaſures of her palace, that ſhe gave herſelf little trouble as to what paſſed in the iſland at large. Her whole time was employed in ſchemes for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing and varying her amuſements: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, indeed, ſhe walked into the country: but her preſence no longer appeared to give any pleaſure to her ſubjects—there were no more ſongs in her praiſe—no more cries of
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030190_0060_0FE5050DE412F470"/>
"Long live our Queen!" "What," ſaid Myra, <q>can occaſion this ſtrange alteration in the behaviour of my people? Are they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with any part of my government?</q> 
               <q>If, ſaid Philintus, they are out of humour with ſuch an amiable ſovereign, they do not deſerve the honour of her inquiries.</q> This anſwer was not entirely ſatisfactory to the Queen; ſhe was even for ſome time, buried in thought; but the efforts of Philintus, (who had obſerved the gloom on her countenance,) and the gay turn of his converſation, together with the novelty of an entertainment which he propoſed for the next evening, drove away all ſerious thoughts, and ſprightlineſs reſumed its reign again. The plan was, that all the court ſhould appear in paſtoral dreſſes, and that the company ſhould dance on one of thoſe elegant lawns with which the palace garden abounded. Myra approved of this plan, only deſiring that the habits might be as elegant as the plan would allow. <q>They can only be made of linen, madam,</q> ſaid one of the bedchamber-women. "How ſo,?" ſaid the Queen.</p>
            <p>
               <q>There is not, in your Majeſty's dominions, ſilk enough for one dreſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You muſt be miſtaken. On my taking the government into my hands, I obſerved ſhops without end, well furniſhed with ſilk.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is true, Madam, there were ſuch; but they are now all ſhut up, and the owners have left the iſland.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"And why ſo, pray?"</p>
            <p>
               <q>Since your Majeſty's orders for the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030190_0061_0FE50491A8EF4368"/>
of all caterpillars, the ſilk manufacture is entirely ſtopped.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Aye! why, what have thoſe naſty vermin to do with the manufacture of ſilk?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>There is one ſpecies of thoſe caterpillars which produces the materials, without which ſilk cannot be made; and as the ſellers of ſilk in the towns are in general connected, by marriage or relationſhip, with the breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the ſilk-worms, they have determined all together to quit a country where they are deprived of the means of ſubſiſting.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That very evening the Queen obſerved with a ſurpriſe, which almoſt equalled horror, that the apartments of the palace were lighted with tallow candles. "Heavens!" exclaimed the affronted Sovereign, <q>what means this filthy ſight?</q> She was told that there were no wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en tapers to be found in the iſle. "'Tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible!" ſhe cried; "let Ariſtus be ſent for." He appeared. <q>Have you not told me, Sir, that my iſland abounded with wax?</q> 
               <q>Madam, it did ſo, when I gave you that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</q> 
               <q>And how happens it that it is not ſo now?</q> 
               <q>Becauſe ſince your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ordered the bees to be extirpated, no more wax is to be found.</q> Philintus ſneer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this reply, and Myra aſked with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <q>What was the connexion between bees and tapers?</q> 
               <q>Without them, ſaid Ariſtus, the tapers can not exiſt, ſince the bees ſupply the materials of which the tapers are compoſed.</q> 
               <q>And what is become of thoſe who uſed to get their living by making thoſe tapers?</q> 
               <q>Poor ſouls! replied Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030190_0062_0FE5050FB5029E20"/>
they are on the point of quitting a place, where they cannot earn their bread. Alas! added he, were your Majeſty to make, at this time, the tour of your dominions, you would find the face of the whole country de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorably altered.</q> Philinus would have turned this account into ridicule, but Myra, by a look, ſtopped his buffoonery, and retired to her chamber with a heavy heart.</p>
            <p>The next morning ſhe took Ariſtus with her, and drove into the environs of her capital. <q>You were too much in the right, ſhe ſaid, when you bade me expect a deplorable alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation among my people. I hear no more acclamations! no more ſongs! but I ſee the painfulleſt of ſights; crowds of people in rags, begging their bread,</q> 
               <q>Formerly, ſaid Ariſtus, no beggars were to be found here; there was a large building erected for the poor, where the old were maintained, the ſick cured, and all the young folks ſet to work; but ſince your Majeſty has allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed twelve to be the age of diſcretion, many of theſe children have refuſed to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and chooſing to wander about the country, without knowing how to get their bread, they are of courſe reduced to rags and miſery.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen, having given ſome relief to theſe wretched objects, proceeded to aſk Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, what was become of the crowds of buſy people who were uſed to throng in the ſtreets of the capital? "for," ſaid ſhe, <q>half the houſes ſeem to be ſhut up, and the whole town ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears deſerted, in compariſon of its ſtate when I firſt ſaw it.</q> The miniſter told her,
<q>
                  <pb n="59" facs="unknown:030190_0063_0FE5049352CBA540"/>
that there was a mutual dependence of one trade upon another, and that, in conſequence of the departure of the ſilk and wax mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and manufacturers, thoſe who were uſed to ſupply that large body of men with cloaths, ſhoes and ſtockings, proviſions, and every other accommodation, having now no market for their goods, had ſhut up their ſhops, and were preparing, one and all, for their departure. He added, that it was much to be feared, that the farmers, who uſed to bring to the town corn, hay, butter, eggs, poultry, &amp;c. together with their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, labourers, &amp;c. would ſoon follow this example.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Struck with this painful detail, the young Queen, whoſe goodneſs of heart was equal to the thoughtleſſneſs of her head, exclaimed in an agony of diſtreſs, <q>Oh heavens! why did I leave my father's court? why take upon me a taſk of which I was ſo incapable? I ſuffer ſeverely for my preſumption, but at leaſt I will do no more miſchief here.</q> Then turning to Ariſtus, ſhe begged him to haſten the preparations for her return to the kingdom of her father. Her orders were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly obeyed, and ſhe with her whole court, took leave of the Fortunate Iſland, and ſoon reached the port they wiſhed for. As ſoon as Myra ſaw the King, ſhe threw herſelf at his feet, bathed in tears. <q>How is this, ſaid he, my daughter, are you returned already? are you ſo ſoon weary of ſovereign power?</q> 
               <q>Alas! Sire! replied the weeping Myra, never was any being more wretched than your
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:030190_0064_0FE5051485E2C278"/>
daughter! I have childiſhly thrown away my own happineſs, and that of thoſe whom you entruſted to my care. The iſland which I have governed, no longer deſerves the name of Fortunate. I have, by my own miſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, reduced an induſtrious people to beggary and ruin! but I conjure you, Sire, to order all my jewels to be inſtantly ſold, that I may, by their means, in ſome ſort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the miſeries which my infantine folly has brought upon them.</q> 
               <q>Make yourſelf eaſy,</q> ſaid the good King, ſoothing his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted daughter, <q>the miſchiefs which your want of conſideration has cauſed, are by no means irreparable.

            <head>The NATURAL HISTORY of the BEE.</head>
            <p>TO give a complete hiſtory of this inſect in a few pages, which ſome have exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed volumes in deſcribing, and whoſe nature and properties ſtill continue in diſpute, is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It will be ſufficient to give a general idea of the animal's operations; which, though they have been ſtudied for more than two thouſand years, are ſtill but incompletely known. The account given us by Reaumur is ſufficiently minute; and, if true, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wonderful: but I find many of the facts which he relates, doubted by thoſe who are moſt converſant with bees; and ſome of them actually declared not to have a real exiſtence in nature.</p>
            <p>It is unhappy, therefore, for thoſe whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod demands an hiſtory of bees, that they are unfurniſhed with thoſe materials which have
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030190_0066_0FE5051F5B387D98"/>
induced ſo many obſervers to contradict ſo great a naturaliſt. His life was ſpent in the contemplation; and it requires an equal ſhare of attention to prove the error of his diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Without entering, therefore, into the diſpute, I will take him for my guide; and juſt mention, as I go along, thoſe particulars in which ſucceeding obſervers have begun to think him erroneous. Which of the two are right, time only can diſcover; for my part I have only heard one ſide, for as yet none have been ſo bold as openly to oppoſe Reaumur's delightful reſearches.</p>
            <p>There are three different kinds of bees in every hive. Firſt, the labouring bees, which make up the far greateſt number, and are thought to be neither male or female, but mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly born for the purpoſes of labour, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the breed, by ſupplying the young with proviſion, while yet in their helpleſs ſtate. The ſecond ſort are the drones; they are of a darker colour, longer, and more thick by one third than the former: they are ſuppoſed to be the males; and there is not above a hundred of them, in a hive of ſeven or eight thouſand bees. The third ſort is much larger than either of the former, and ſtill fewer in number: ſome aſſert, that there is not above one in every ſwarm; but this later obſervers affirm not to be true, there being ſometimes five or ſix in the ſame hive. Theſe are called queen-bees, and are ſaid to lay all the eggs from which the whole ſwarm is hatched in a ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>In examining the ſtructure of the common working bee, the firſt remarkable part that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030190_0067_0FE504967458ECB8"/>
is the trunk, which ſerves to extract the honey from flowers. It is not formed, like that of the other flies, in the manner of a tube, by which the fluid is to be ſucked up; but like a beſom, to ſweep, or a tongue, to lick it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. The animal is furniſhed alſo with teeth, which ſerve it in making wax. This ſubſtance is gathered from flowers, like honey; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of that duſt or farina which contributes to the fecundation of plants, and is moulded into wax by the little animal, at leiſure. Every bee, when it leaves the hive to collect this precious ſtore, enters into the cup of the flower, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſuch as ſeem charged with the greateſt quantities of this yellow farina. As the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal's body is covered over with hair, it rolls itſelf within the flower, and ſoon becomes quite covered with the duſt, which it ſoon after bruſhes off with its own hind legs, and kneads into two little balls. In the thighs of the hind legs there are to cavities, edged with hair; and into theſe, as into a baſket, the animal ſticks its pellets. Thus employed, the bee flies from flower to flower, encreaſing its ſtore, and adding to its ſtock of wax; until the ball, upon each thigh, becomes as big as a grain of pepper: by this time, having got a ſufficient load, it returns, the beſt of its way to the hive.</p>
            <p>The belly of the bee is divided into ſix rings, which ſometimes ſhorten the body, by ſlipping one over the other. It contains within it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the inteſtines, the honey-bag, the venom-bag, and the ſting. The honey-bag is as tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent as cryſtal, containing the honey that
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030190_0068_0FE505211CB6A5A0"/>
the bee has bruſhed from the flowers; of which the greater part is carried to the hive, and poured into the cells of the honey-comb; while the remainder ſerves for the bee's own nouriſhment: for, during ſummer, it never touches what has been laid up for the winter. The ſting, which ſerves to defend this little ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal from its enemies, is compoſed of three parts; the ſheath, and two darts, which are extremely ſmall and penetrating. Both the darts have ſeveral ſmall points or barbs, like thoſe of a fiſh-hook, which render the ſting more painful, and make the darts rankle in the wound. Still, however, this inſtrument would be very ſlight, did not the bee poiſon the wound. The ſheath, which has a ſharp point, makes the firſt impreſſion; which is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by that of the darts, and then the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous liquor is poured in. The ſheath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſticks ſo faſt in the wound, that the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal is obliged to leave it behind; by which the bee ſoon after dies, and the wound is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably enflamed. It might at firſt appear well for mankind, if the bee were without its ſting: but, upon recollection, it will be found, that the little animal would then have too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rivals in ſharing its labours. An hundred other lazy animals, fond of honey, and hating labour, would intrude upon the ſweets of the hive; and the treaſure would be carried off, for want of armed guardians to protect it.</p>
            <p>From examining the bee ſingly, we now come to conſider it in ſociety, as an animal not only ſubject to laws, but active, vigilant, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, and diſintereſted. All its proviſions
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030190_0069_0FE504A480ACCE48"/>
are laid up for the community; and all its arts in building a cell, deſigned for the benefit of poſterity. The ſubſtance with which bees build their cells is wax: which is faſhioned into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient apartments for themſelves and their young. When they begin to work in their hives, they divide themſelves into four com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies: one of which roves in the fields in ſearch of materials; another employs itſelf in laying out the bottom and partitions of their cells; a third is employed in making the inſide ſmooth from the corners and angles; and the fourth company bring food for the reſt, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe who return with their reſpective bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. But they are not kept conſtant to one employment; they often change the taſks aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them: thoſe that have been at work, being permitted to go abroad; and thoſe that have been in the fields already, take their places. They ſeem even to have ſigns, by which they underſtand each other; for when any of them want food, it bends down its trunk to the bee from whom it is expected, which then opens its honey-bag, and lets ſome drops fall into the other's mouth, which is at that time opened to receive it. Their diligence and labour is ſo great, that, in a day's time, they are able to make cells, which lie upon each other, numerous enough to contain three thouſand bees.</p>
            <p>If we examine their cells, they will be found formed in the exacteſt proportion. It was ſaid by Pappus, an ancient geometrician, that, of all other figures, hexagons were the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient;
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030190_0070_0FE50522A9375888"/>
for, when placed touching each other the moſt convenient room would be given, and the ſmalleſt loſt. The cells of the bees are perfect hexagons: theſe, in every honey-comb, are double, opening on either ſide, and cloſed at the bottom. The bottoms are compoſed of little triangular panes, which, when united together, terminate in a point, and lie exactly upon the extremities of other panes of the ſame ſhape, in oppoſite cells. Theſe lodgings have ſpaces, like ſtreets, between them, large enough to give the bees a free paſſage in and out; and yet narrow enough to preſerve the neceſſary heat. The mouth of every cell is defended by a border, which makes the door a little leſs than the inſide of the cell, which ſerves to ſtrengthen the whole. Theſe cells ſerve for different purpoſes: for laying up their young; for their wax, which in winter becomes a part of their food; and for their honey, which makes their principal ſubſiſtence.</p>
            <p>It is well known that the habitation of bees ought to be very cloſe; and what their hives want, from the negligence and unſkilfulneſs of man, theſe animals ſupply by their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry: ſo that it is their principal care, when firſt hived, to ſtop up all the crannies. For this purpoſe they make uſe of a reſinous gum, which is more tenacious than wax, and differs greatly from it. This the ancients called Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis: it will grow conſiderably hard in June; though it will in ſome meaſure ſoften by heat; and is often found different in conſiſtence, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and ſmell. It has generally an agreeable aromatic odour when it is warmed; and by
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030190_0071_0FE504A60CE08A10"/>
ſome it is conſidered as a moſt grateful perfume. When the bees begin to work with it, it is ſoft, but it acquires a firmer conſiſtence every day; till at length it aſſumes a brown colour, and becomes much harder than wax. The bees car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it on their hinder legs; and ſome think it is met with on the birch, the willow, and pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. However it is procured, it is certain that they plaiſter the inſide of their hives with this compoſition.</p>
            <p>If examined through a glaſs hive, from the hurry the whole ſwarm is in, the whole at firſt appears like anarchy and confuſion; but the ſpectator ſoon finds every animal diligently employed, and following one purſuit, with a ſettled purpoſe. Their teeth are the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by which they model and faſhion their various buildings, and give them ſuch ſymme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and perfection. They begin at the top of the hive; and ſeveral of them work at a time, at the cells which have two faces. If they are ſtinted with regard to time, they give the new cells but half the depth which they ought to have; leaving them imperfect, till they have ſketched out the number of cells neceſſary for the preſent occaſion. The conſtruction of their combs, coſts them a great deal of labour: they are made by inſenſible additions; and not caſt at once in a mold, as ſome are apt to imagine. There ſeems no end of their ſhaping, finiſhing, and turning them neatly up. The cells for their young are moſt carefully formed; thoſe deſigned for lodging the drones, are larger than the reſt; and that for the queen-bee, the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt of all. The cells in which the young
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030190_0072_0FE5052430E59FB8"/>
brood are lodged, ſerve at different times for containing honey; and this proceeds from an obvious cauſe: every worm, before it is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into an aurelia, hangs its old ſkin on the partitions of its cell; and thus, while it ſtrengthens the wall, diminiſhes the capacity of its late apartment. The ſame cell, in a ſingle ſummer, is often tenanted by three or four worms in ſucceſſion; and the next ſeaſon, by three or four more. Each worm takes particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar care to fortify the pannels of its cell, by hanging up its ſpoils there: thus, the partitions being lined, ſix or eight deep, become at laſt too narrow for a new brood, and are converted into ſtore-houſes, for honey.</p>
            <p>Thoſe cells where nothing but honey is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited, are much deeper than the reſt. When the harveſt of honey is ſo plentiful that they have not ſufficient room for it, they either lengthen their combs, or build more; which are much longer than the former. Sometimes they work at three combs at a time; for, when there are three work-houſes, more bees may be thus employed, without embarraſſment.</p>
            <p>But honey, as was before obſerved, is not the only food upon which theſe animals ſubſiſt. The meal of flowers, of which their wax is formed, is one of their moſt favourite repaſts. This is a diet which they live upon during the ſummer; and of which they lay up a large win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proviſion. The wax of which their combs are made, is no more than this meal digeſted, and wrought into a paſte. When the flowers upon which bees generally feed, are not fully blown, and this meal or duſt is not offered in
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030190_0073_0FE504A7E696CCA8"/>
ſufficient quantities, the bees pinch the tops of the ſtamina in which it is contained, with their teeth; and thus anticipate the progreſs of vegetation. In April and May, the bees are buſy, from morning to evening, in gathering this meal; but when the weather becomes too hot in the midſt of ſummer, they work only in the morning.</p>
            <p>The bee is furniſhed with a ſtomach for its wax, as well as its honey. In the former of the two, their powder is altered, digeſted and concocted into real wax; and is thus ejected by the ſame paſſage by which it was ſwallowed. Every comb, newly made, is white: but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes yellow as it grows old, and almoſt black when kept too long in the hive. Beſide the wax thus digeſted, there is a large portion of the powder kneaded up for food in every hive, and kept in ſeparate cells, for winter provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This is called, by the country people, bee-bread; and contributes to the health and ſtrength of the animal during winter. Thoſe who rear bees, may rob them of their honey, and feed them, during the winter, with treacle; but no proper ſubſtitute has yet been found for the bee-bread; and, without it, the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals become conſumptive and die.</p>
            <p>As for the honey, it is extracted from that part of the flower called the nectareum. From the mouth this delicious fluid paſſes into the gullet: and then into the firſt ſtomach, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-bag, which, when filled, appears like an oblong bladder. Children, that live in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try places, are well acquainted with this blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and deſtroy many bees to come at their
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030190_0074_0FE5052BD8EC37F0"/>
ſtore of honey. When a bee has ſufficiently filled its firſt ſtomach, it returns back to the hive, where it diſgorges the honey into one of the cells. It often happens that the bee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers its ſtore to ſome other, at the mouth of the hive, and flies off for a freſh ſupply. Some honey-combs are always left open for common uſe; but many others are ſtopped up, till there is a neceſſity of opening them. Each of theſe are covered carefully with wax; ſo cloſe, that the covers ſeem to be made at the very inſtant the fluid is depoſited within them.</p>
            <p>Having thus given a curſory deſcription of the inſect, individually conſidered, and of the habitation it forms, we next come to its ſocial habits and inſtitutions: and, in conſidering this little animal attentively, after the neceſſary precautions for the immediate preſervation of the community, its ſecond care is turned to the continuance of poſterity. How numerous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the multitude of bees may appear in one ſwarm, yet they all owe their original to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle parent, which is called the queen-bee. It is indeed ſurpriſing that a ſingle inſect ſhall, in one ſummer, give birth to above twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand young: but, upon opening her body, the wonder will ceaſe; as the number of eggs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, at one time, amounts to five thouſand. This animal, whoſe exiſtence is of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to her ſubjects, may eaſily be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the reſt, by her ſize, and the ſhape of her body. On her ſafety depends the whole welfare of the commonwealth; and the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions paid her by all the reſt of the ſwarm, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhow the dependence her ſubjects have
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030190_0075_0FE504ABD8A9E378"/>
upon her ſecurity. If this inſect be carefully obſerved, ſhe will be ſeen at times attended with a numerous retinue, marching from cell to cell, plunging the extremity of her body into many of them, and leaving a ſmall egg in each. When the queen-bee has depoſited the number of eggs neceſſary in the cells, the working bees undertake the care of the riſing poſterity. They are ſeen to leave off their uſual employments; to conſtruct proper receptacles for eggs; or to complete thoſe that are already formed. They purpoſely build little cells, extremely ſolid, for the young; in which they employ a great deal of wax: thoſe deſigned for lodging the males, as was already obſerved, are larger than the reſt; and thoſe for the queen-bees the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt of all. There is uſually but one egg de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in every cell. A day or two after it is depoſited, the worm is excluded from the ſhell of the egg, having the appearance of a maggot rolled up in a ring, and lying ſoftly on a bed of a whitiſh coloured jelly; upon which alſo the little animal begins to feed. In the mean time, the inſtant it appears, the working bees attend it with the moſt anxious and parental tenderneſs; they furniſh it every hour with a ſupply of this whitiſh ſubſtance, on which it feeds and lies; and watch the cell with unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting care. They are nurſes that have a greater affection for the offspring of others, than many parents have for their own children. They are conſtant in viſiting each cell, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that nothing is wanting; preparing the white mixture, which is nothing but a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:030190_0076_0FE5055A9585B848"/>
of honey and wax, in their own bowels, with which they feed them. Thus attended, and plentifully fed, the worm, in leſs than ſix days time, comes to its full growth, and no longer accepts the food offered it. When the bees perceive that it has no further occaſion for feeding, they perform the laſt offices of tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erneſs, and ſhut the little animal up in its cell; walling up the mouth of its apartment with wax: there they leave the worm to itſelf; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecured it from every external injury.</p>
            <p>The worm is no ſooner left encloſed, but, from a ſtate of inaction, it begins to labour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending and ſhortening its body; and by this means lining the walls of its apartment with a ſilken tapeſtry, which it ſpins in the manner of caterpillars, before they undergo their laſt transformation. When their cell is thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, the animal is ſoon after transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an aurelia; but differing from that of the common caterpillar, as it exhibits not only the legs, but the wings of the future bee, in its preſent ſtate of inactivity. Thus, in about twenty, or one and twenty days after the egg was laid, the bee is completely formed, and fitted to undergo the fatigues of its ſtate. When all its parts have acquired their proper ſtrength and conſiſtence, the young animal opens its priſon, by piercing with its teeth the waxen door that confines it. When juſt freed from its cell, it is as yet moiſt, and incommoded with the ſpoils of its former ſituation; but the officious bees are ſoon ſeen to flock round it, and to lick it clean on all ſides with their trunks; while another band, with equal aſſiduity, are
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:030190_0077_0FE504B7C1BBD900"/>
obſerved to feed it with honey: others again begin immediately to cleanſe the cell that has been juſt left; to carry the ordures out of the hive, and to fit the place for a new inhabitant. The young bee ſoon repays their care, by its induſtry; for as ſoon as ever its external parts become dry, it diſcovers its natural appetites for labour, and induſtriouſly begins the taſk, which it purſues unremittingly through life. The toil of man is irkſome to him, and he earns his ſubſiſtence with pain; but this little animal ſeems happy in its purſuits, and finds delight in all its employments.</p>
            <p>When bees firſt begin to break their priſons, there are generally above a hundred excluded in one day. Thus, in the ſpace of a few weeks, the number of the inhabitants in one hive, of moderate ſize, becomes ſo great, that there is no place to contain the new comers; and they are ſcarcely excluded from the cell, when they are obliged, by the old bees, to ſally forth in queſt of new habitations. In other words, the hive begins to ſwarm, and the new progeny prepares for exile.</p>
            <p>While there is room enough in the hive, the bees remain quietly together; it is neceſſity alone that compels the ſeparation. Sometimes indeed, the young brood, with graceleſs obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, refuſe to depart, and even venture to reſiſt their progenitors. The young ones are known by being browner than the old, with whiter hair; the old ones are of a lighter co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, with red hair. The two armies are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eaſily diſtinguiſhable, and dreadful battles are often ſeen to enſue. But the victory al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:030190_0078_0FE50533C6E66738"/>
ever terminates, with ſtrict political juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, in favour of the veterans, and the rebellious offspring are driven off, not without loſs and mutilation.</p>
            <p>In different countries, the ſwarms make their appearance at different times of the year, and there are ſeveral ſigns previous to this intended migration. The night before, an unuſual buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is heard in the hive; in the morning, though the weather be ſoft and inviting, they ſeem not to obey the call, being intent on more important meditations within. All labour is diſcontinued in the hive, every bee is either employed in forcing, or reluctantly yielding a ſubmiſſion; at length, after ſome noiſe and tumult, a queen bee is choſen, to guard, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than conduct, the young colony to other habitations, and then they are marſhalled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any apparent conductor. In leſs than a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, they leave their native abode, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cloud round their protectreſs, they ſet off, without ſeeming to know the place of their deſtination; <hi>The world before them, where to chooſe their place of reſt.</hi> The uſual time of ſwarming, is from ten in the morning, to three in the afternoon, when the ſun ſhines bright, and invites them to ſeek their fortunes. They flutter for a while, in the air, like flakes of ſnow, and ſometimes undertake a diſtant jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but more frequently are contented with ſome neighbouring aſylum; the branch of a tree, a chimney top, or ſome other expoſed ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. It is, indeed, remarkable, that all thoſe animals, of whatever kind, that have long been under the protection of man, ſeem
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:030190_0079_0FE504B9F0978788"/>
to loſe a part of their natural ſagacity, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for themſelves. The rabbit, when do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticated, forgets to dig holes, the hen to build a neſt, and the bee to ſeek a ſhelter, that ſhall protect it from the inclemencies of winter. In thoſe countries, where the bees are wild, and unprotected by man, they are always ſure to build their waxen cells in the hollow of a tree; but with us, they ſeem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provident in their choice, and the firſt green branch that ſtops their flight, ſeems to be thought ſufficient for their abode through win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. However, it does not appear, that the queen chooſes the place where they are to alight, for many of the ſtragglers, who ſeem to be pleaſed with a particular branch, go and ſettle upon it; others are ſeen to ſucceed, and at laſt, the queen herſelf, when ſhe finds a ſufficient number there before her, goes to make it the place of her head quarters. When the queen is ſettled, the reſt of the ſwarm ſoon follow; and, in about a quarter of an hour, the whole body ſeem to be at eaſe. It ſometimes is found, that there are two or three queens to a ſwarm, and the colony is divided into parties; but it moſt uſually happens, that one of theſe is more conſiderable than the other, and the bees by degrees, deſert the weakeſt, to take ſhelter under the moſt powerful protector. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted queen does not long ſurvive this defeat; ſhe takes refuge under the new monarch, and is ſoon deſtroyed by her jealous rival. Till this cruel execution is performed, the bees ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go out to work; and if there ſhould be a queen-bee, belonging to the new colony, left
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030190_0080_0FE5053553A5C518"/>
in the old hive, ſhe always undergoes the fate of the former. However, it muſt be obſerved, that the bees never ſacrifice any of their queens, when the hive is full of wax and honey; for there is at that time, no danger in maintaining a plurality of breeders.</p>
            <p>When the ſwarm is thus conducted to a place of reſt, and the policy of government is ſettled, the bees ſoon reſume their former labours.</p>
            <p>When a hive ſends out ſeveral ſwarms in the year, the firſt is always the beſt, and the moſt numerous. Theſe, having the whole ſummer before them, have the more time for making wax and honey, and conſequently their labours are the moſt valuable to the proprietor. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſwarm chiefly conſiſts of the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt bees, yet it is often found, that bees of all ages compoſe the multitude of emigrants, and it often happens, that bees of all ages are ſeen remaining behind. The number of them is always more conſiderable than that of ſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous cities, for ſometimes upwards of forty thouſand are found in a ſingle hive. So large a body may well be ſuppoſed to work with great expedition; and in fact, in leſs than twenty four hours, they will make combs above twenty inches long, and ſeven or eight broad. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they will half fill their hives with wax, in leſs than five days. In the firſt fifteen days, they are always found to make more wax than they do afterwards during the reſt of the year.</p>
            <p>Having mentioned the induſtry of theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable inſects, it will be proper to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the effects of their labour, of that wax and honey, which are turned by man to ſuch
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030190_0081_0FE504BB7AC10FB8"/>
various uſes. Bees gather together two kinds of wax, one coarſe and the other fine. The coarſer ſort is bitter, and with this, which is called <hi>propolis,</hi> they ſtop up all the holes and crevices of their hives. It is of a more reſinous nature than the fine wax, and is conſequently better qualified to reſiſt the moiſture of the ſeaſon, and preſerve the works warm and dry within. The fine wax is as neceſſary to the animals preſervation as the honey itſelf. With this they make their lodgings, with this they cover the cells of their young, and in this they lay up their magazines of honey. This is made, as has been already obſerved, from the duſt of flowers, which is carefully kneaded by the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inſect, then ſwallowed, and having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone a kind of digeſtion, is formed into the cells, which anſwers ſuch a variety of purpoſes. To collect this, the animal rolls itſelf in the flower it would rob, and thus takes up the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable duſt with the hair of its body. Then carefully bruſhing it into a lump, with its fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paws it thruſts the compoſition into two cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties behind the thighs, which are made like ſpoons to receive the wax, and the hair that lines them, ſerves to keep it from falling.</p>
            <p>As of wax, there are alſo two kinds of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The white and the yellow. The white is taken without fire from the honey-combs. The yellow is extracted by heat, and ſqueezed through bags, in a preſs. The beſt honey is new, thick and granulated, of a clear tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent white colour, of a ſoft and aromatic ſmell, and of a ſweet lively taſte. Honey made in mountainous countries, is preferable to that of
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:030190_0082_0FE50536DD0736A0"/>
the valley. The honey made in the ſpring, is more highly eſteemed, than that gathered in ſummer, which laſt is ſtill more valuable, than that of autumn, when the flowers begin to fade and loſe their fragrance.</p>

            <head>Of the SILKWORM.</head>
            <p>THIS little creature, which only works for itſelf, has been made of the utmoſt ſervice to man; and furniſhes him with a cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more beautiful than any other animal can ſupply. We may declaim indeed againſt the luxuries of the times, when ſilk is ſo generally worn; but were ſuch garments to fail, what other arts could ſupply their deficiency?</p>
            <p>Though ſilk was anciently brought in ſmall quantities to Rome, yet it was ſo ſcarce as to be ſold for its weight in gold; and was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as ſuch a luxurious refinement in dreſs, that it was infamous for a man to appear in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of which ſilk formed but half the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. It was moſt probably brought among them from the remoteſt parts of the eaſt; ſince it was, at that time of which I am ſpeaking, ſcarcely known even in Perſia.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more remote from the truth, than the manner in which their hiſtorians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the animal by which ſilk is produced. Pauſanius informs us, that ſilk came from the country of the Seres, a people of Aſiatic Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia;
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:030190_0083_0FE504BD2997B480"/>
in which place an inſect, as large as the beetle, but in every other reſpect reſembling a ſpider, was bred up for that purpoſe. They take great care, as he aſſures us, to feed and defend it from the weather; as well during the ſummer's heat, as the rigours of winter. This inſect, he obſerves, makes its web with its feet, of which it has eight in number. It is fed, for the ſpace of four years, upon a kind of paſte, prepared for it; and at the beginning of the fifth, it is ſupplied with leaves of the green willow, of which it is particularly fond; it then feeds till it burſts with fat: after which they take out its bowels, which are ſpun into the beautiful manufacture ſo ſcarce and coſtly.</p>
            <p>The real hiſtory of this animal was unknown among the Romans till the times of Juſtinian; and it is ſuppoſed, that ſilkworms were not brought into Europe till the beginning of the twelfth century; when Roger of Sicily, brought workmen in this manufacture from Aſia Minor, after his return from his expedition to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Land, and ſettled them in Sicily and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria. From theſe the other kingdoms of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope learned this manufacture; and it is now one of the moſt lucrative carried on among the ſouthern provinces of Europe.</p>
            <p>The ſilkworm is now very well known to be a large caterpillar, of a whitiſh colour, with twelve feet, and producing a butterfly of the moth kind. The cone on which it ſpins, is formed for covering it while it continues in the aurelia ſtate; and ſeveral of theſe properly wound off, and united together, form thoſe ſtrong and beautiful threads, which are woven into
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030190_0084_0FE50543181C60E8"/>
ſilk. The feeding theſe worms, the gathering, the winding, the twiſting, and the weaving their ſilk, is one of the principal manufactures of Europe; and, as their luxuries increaſe, ſeems every day to become more and more neceſſary to human happineſs.</p>
            <p>There are two methods of breeding ſilk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms; for they may be left to grow, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at liberty upon the trees where they are hatched; or they may be kept in a place built for that purpoſe, and fed every day with freſh leaves. The firſt method is uſed in China, Tonquin, and other hot countries; the other is uſed in other places where the animal has been artificially propagated, and ſtill continues a ſtranger. In the warm climates, the ſilk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm proceeds from an egg, which has been glued by the parent moth upon proper parts of the mulberry-tree, and which remains in that ſituation during the winter. The manner in which they are ſituated and fixed to the tree, keeps them unaffected by the influence of the weather; ſo that thoſe froſts which are ſevere enough to kill the tree, have no power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the ſilkworm.</p>
            <p>The inſect never proceeds from the egg till Nature has provided it a ſufficient ſupply; and till the budding leaves are furniſhed, in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient abundance, for its ſupport. When the leaves are put forth, the worms ſeem to feel the genial ſummons, and burſting from their little eggs, crawl upon the leaves, where they feed with a moſt voracious appetite. Thus they become larger by degrees; and after ſome months feeding, they lay, upon every leaf,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030190_0085_0FE504CA71E521E0"/>
ſmall bundles, or cones of ſilk, which appear like ſo many golden apples, painted on a fine green ground. Such is the method of breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in the Eaſt; and without doubt it is beſt for the worms, and leaſt troubleſome for the feeder of them. But it is otherwiſe in the colder European climates; the frequent chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the weather, and the heavy dews of the evenings render the keeping them all night ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, ſubject to ſo many inconveniences, as to admit of no remedy. It is true, that by the aſſiſtance of nets, they may be preſerved from the inſults of birds; but the ſevere cold weather, which often ſucceeds the firſt heats of ſummer, as well as the rain and high winds, will deſtroy them all: and therefore, to breed them in Europe, they muſt be ſheltered and protected from every external injury.</p>
            <p>For this purpoſe, a room is choſen, with a ſouth aſpect; and the windows are ſo well gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, as not to admit the leaſt air: the walls are well built, and the planks of the floor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding cloſe, ſo as to admit neither birds nor mice, nor even ſo much as an inſect. In the middle there ſhould be four pillars erected, or four wooden poſts, ſo placed as to form a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty large ſquare. Between theſe are different ſtories made with ozier hurdles; and under each hurdle there ſhould be a floor, with an upright border all round. Theſe hurdles and floors muſt hang upon pullies, ſo as to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, or taken down at pleaſure.</p>
            <p>When the worms are hatched, ſome tender mulberry leaves are provided, and placed in the cloth or paper box in which the eggs were
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030190_0086_0FE50544D09E8058"/>
laid, and which are large enough to hold a great number. When they have acquired ſome ſtrength, they muſt be diſtributed on beds of mulberry leaves, in the different ſtories of the ſquare in the middle of the room, round which a perſon may freely paſs on every ſide. They will fix themſelves to the leaves, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to the ſticks of the hurdles, when the leaves are devoured. They have then a thread, by which they can ſuſpend themſelves on occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to prevent any ſhock by a fall; but this is by no means to be conſidered as the ſilk which they ſpin afterwards in ſuch abundance. Care muſt be taken that freſh leaves be brought every morning, which muſt be ſtrewed very gently and equally over them; upon which the ſilkworms will forſake the remainder of the old leaves, which muſt be carefully taken away, and every thing kept very clean; for nothing hurts theſe inſects ſo much as moiſture and uncleanlineſs. For this reaſon their leaves muſt be gathered when the weather is dry, and kept in a dry place, if it be neceſſary to lay in a ſtore. As theſe animals have but a ſhort time to live, they make uſe of every moment, and almoſt continually are ſpinning except at thoſe intervals when they change their ſkins. If mulberry leaves be difficult to be obtained, the leaves of lettuce or holyoak will ſuſtain them: but they do not thrive ſo well upon their new diet; and their ſilk will neither be ſo copious, nor of ſo good a quality.</p>
            <p>Though the judicious choice, and careful management of their diet, is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, yet there is another precaution of equal
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:030190_0087_0FE504CCA6C32820"/>
importance, which is to give them air, and open their chamber windows, at ſuch times as the ſun ſhines warmeſt. The place alſo muſt be kept as clean as poſſible; not only the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral floors that are laid to receive their ordure, but the whole apartments in general. Theſe things well obſerved, contribute greatly to their health and encreaſe.</p>
            <p>The worm, at the time it burſts the ſhell, is extremely ſmall, and of a black colour; but the head is of a more ſhining black than the reſt of the body: ſome days after, they begin to turn whitiſh, or of an aſh-coloured grey. After the ſkin begins to grow too rigid, or the animal is ſtinted within it, the inſect throws it off, and appears cloathed a-new: it then becomes larger and much whiter, though it has a greeniſh caſt: after ſome days, which are more or leſs, according to the different heat of the climate, or to the quality of the food it leaves off eating, and ſeems to ſleep for two days together: then it begins to ſtir, and put itſelf into violent motions, till the ſkin falls off the ſecond time, and is thrown aſide by the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal's feet. All theſe changes are made in three weeks or a month's time; after which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to feed once more, ſtill in its caterpillar form, but a good deal differing from itſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its change. In a few days time it ſeems to ſleep again; and, when it awakes, it again changes its cloathing, and continues feeding as before. When it has thus taken a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of food, and its parts are diſpoſed for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the aurelia form, the animal forſakes, for the laſt time, all food and ſociety, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:030190_0088_0FE4FD063B963DF0"/>
itſelf a retreat to defend it from external injuries, while it is ſeemingly deprived of life and motion.</p>
            <p>This retreat is no other than its cone, or ball of ſilk, which Nature has taught it to compoſe with great art; and within which it buries itſelf, till it aſſumes its winged form. This cone or ball is ſpun from two little long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh kinds of bags that lie above the inteſtines, and are filled with a gummy fluid, of a mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gold colour. This is the ſubſtance of which the threads are formed; and the little animal is furniſhed with a ſurpriſing apparatus for ſpinning it to the degree of fineneſs which its occaſions may require. This inſtrument in ſome meaſure reſembles a wire-drawer's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, in which gold or ſilver threads are drawn to any degree of minuteneſs; and through this the animal draws its thread with great aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. As every thread proceeds from two gum-bags, it is probable that each ſupplies its own; which, however, are united, as they proceed from the animal's body. If we examine the thread with a microſcope, it will be found that it is flatted on one ſide, and grooved along its length; from hence we may infer, that it is doubled juſt upon leaving the body; and that the two threads ſtick to each other by that gummy quality of which they are poſſeſſed. Previous to ſpinning its web, the ſilkworm ſeeks out ſome convenient place to erect its cell, without any obſtruction. When it has found a leaf, or a chink fitted to its purpoſe, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to wreathe its head in every direction, and faſtens its thread on every ſide to the ſides of
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:030190_0089_0FE504CE358CF430"/>
its retreat. Though all its firſt eſſays ſeem perfectly confuſed, yet they are not altogether without deſign: there appears indeed, no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or contrivance in the diſpoſal of its firſt threads; they are by no means laid artfully over each other, but are thrown out at random, to ſerve as an external ſhelter againſt rain; for nature having appointed the animal to work upon trees in the open air, its habits remain, though it is brought up in a warm apartment.</p>
            <p>Malpighi pretends to have obſerved ſix dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent layers in a ſingle cone of ſilk: but what may eaſily be obſerved is, that it is compoſed externally of a kind of rough cotton-like ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which is called floſs; within the thread it is more diſtinct and even; and next the body of the aurelia, the apartment ſeems lined with a ſubſtance of the hardneſs of paper, but of a much ſtronger conſiſtence. It muſt not be ſuppoſed, that the thread which goes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the cone, is rolled round, as we roll a bottom; on the contrary, it lies upon it in a very irregular manner, and winds off from one ſide of the cone, and then from the other. This whole thread, if meaſured, will be found about three hundred yards long; and ſo very fine, that eight or ten of them are generally rolled off into one by the manufacturers. The cone, when completed, is in form like a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon's egg, and more pointed at one end than the other; at the ſmaller end, the head of the aurelia is generally found; and this is the place that the inſect, when converted into a moth, is generally ſeen to burſt through.</p>
            <p>It is generally a fortnight or three weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:030190_0090_0FE5054B534B21F8"/>
the aurelia is changed into a moth; but no ſooner is the winged inſect completely form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than having diveſted itſelf of its aurelia ſkin, it prepares to burſt through its cone, or outward priſon: for this purpoſe it extends its head towards the point of the cone, butts with its eyes, which are rough, againſt the lining of its cell, wears it away, and at laſt puſhes forward, through a paſſage which is ſmall at firſt, but which enlarges as the animal encreaſes its efforts for emancipation; while the tattered remnants of its aurelia ſkin lie in confuſion within the cone, like a bundle of dirty linen.</p>
            <p>The animal, when thus ſet free from its double confinement, appears exhauſted with fatigue, and ſeems produced for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but to tranſmit a future brood. It nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flies nor eats; the male only ſeeking the female, whoſe eggs he impregnates; and their union continues for four days, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. The male dies immediately after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from his mate; and ſhe ſurvives him only till ſhe has laid her eggs, which are not hatched into worms till the enſuing ſpring.</p>
            <p>However, there are few of theſe animals ſuffered to come to a ſtate of maturity; for as their burſting through the cone deſtroys the ſilk, the manufacturers take care to kill the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia, by expoſing it to the ſun, before the moth comes to perfection. This done, they take off the floſs, and throw the cones into warm water, ſtirring them till the firſt thread offers them a clue for winding all off. They generally take eight of the ſilken threads to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; the cones ſtill keep under water, till
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:030190_0091_0FE504CFC4BF64A0"/>
a proper quantity of the ſilk is wound off: however, they do not take all; for the latter parts grow weak, and are of a bad colour. As to the paper-like ſubſtance which remains, ſome ſtain it with a variety of colours, to make artificial flowers; others let it lie in the water, till the glutinous matter which cements it is all diſſolved: it is then carded like wool, ſpun with a wheel, and converted into ſilk ſtuffs of an inferior kind.</p>

               <p>THE reſources of the human mind in ſtruggling againſt misfortunes are never ſo well underſtood, as in ſituations of diſtreſs and difficulty. Nothing is ſo
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:030190_0099_0FE504EFA87B53B8"/>
feeble, nothing ſo helpleſs, as a being that has been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſubſiſt by the labour of others, without the leaſt exertion. This is one of the diſadvantages attending a ſtate of refinement and civilization. Mankind forget the ſimple dictates of reaſon and nature, and make a thouſand pernicious indulgences neceſſary to their ideas of happineſs. One man imagines that it is impoſſible to tranſport himſelf from place to place, without the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of other animals, who are to relieve him from the fatigue of uſing his own legs; another, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ſupply his hunger without a ſplendid table, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the productions of every climate; a third cannot ſleep unleſs upon beds of down, and in a palace. Thus are a thouſand things made neceſſary to our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which have no natural connexion with it, and our lives are conſumed in the acquiſition of ſuperfluous tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles. Our vanity, ever ingenious to torment us, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us incapable of repoſe, and prompts us to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually making uſeleſs compariſons with all around.</p>
               <p>Surely, in this reſpect, the uncultured Savage that inhabits the woods, and aſks no more than a ſkin to repel the winds of winter, an hut to defend him from the ſtorms, and a moderate quantity of the coarſeſt food, is happier far than we. He views the whole detail of luxury with indifference and contempt, and prefers his native woods and plains to all the magnificence of our cities; nor would the moſt effeminate native of our cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ital be more mortified to inhabit the rudeſt foreſts, than he to exchange them for the endleſs reſtraints and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which we ſubmit to in civilized ſociety. He ſleeps as ſound upon a bed of graſs and leaves, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies his hunger as ſatisfactorily with roaſted corn, or millet, as a rich and indolent citizen can do with all the accumulated inventions of arts and manufactures. But in the entire poſſeſſion of all his bodily faculties, how great is the ſuperiority of the Savage! The inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of cities, pale, feeble, and bloated, drags on a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exiſtence with difficulty, under the incumbrance of an hundred diſeaſes, to which his intemperance has
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:030190_0100_0FE4FD145649BBF8"/>
ſubjected him. Before half his life is run out, we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently behold him incapable of uſing his limbs; and that idleneſs, which was at firſt voluntary, becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable, from the imbecility he has contracted. In vain would the beautiful revolution of the ſeaſons attract his notice, or call him out to ſhare the common bleſſings which nature diſpenſes to all her uncorrupted offspring. Neither the care of his own neceſſary affairs, the defence of his country, nor even fears for his own perſonal ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, can any longer animate him to the ſmalleſt exertion; and ſhould he not be in a ſituation to buy the aſſiſtance of others, he muſt remain for ever attached to one ſpot, like a muſcle or an oyſter. How different from this is the life of an American Indian, or a Tartar! Accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his infancy to contend with dangers and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, he becomes hardened againſt all the viciſſitudes of nature, againſt all the attacks of fortune. Wherever the earth extends her ſurface, he finds a bed; the foreſt affords him all the ſhelter he demands; and he can every where procure, by his own induſtry, ſufficient food to ſupply his wants. In the uſe of his limbs, and the full enjoyment of all his natural powers, he is not exceeded by the very beaſts that fly before him. Such are all the uncivilized nations with which we were formerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted; ſuch are thoſe which are lately added to our knowledge by modern diſcoveries.</p>
               <p>But the moſt extraordinary inſtances of the exertions of human beings in difficult ſituations, are to be found in the lives of ſuch men, as have been compelled by ſhipwreck to remain for ſeveral years on uninhabited iſlands. Deprived in an inſtant of all the advantages and ſupport which we derive from mutual aſſiſtance, they have been obliged to call forth all the latent reſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their own minds. From a contemplation of theſe we are enabled to form ſome ideas of the wonderful pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the human conſtitution, when properly ſtimulated to action by neceſſity. The following narrative, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther real or fictitious, ſeems to be admirably adapted to the illuſtration of this ſubject, and therefore we ſhall make no apology for re-printing it in this collection.</p>

               <head>THE HISTORY OF PHILIP QUARLL.</head>
               <p>PHILIP QUARLL was an Engliſh ſailor, who aſſiſted to navigate a ſhip in the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſeas of America. During his voyage, they were aſſailed by ſuch a violent tempeſt, which laſted, without intermiſſion, for two days and nights, that the captain and moſt experienced mariners began to deſpair of the ſafety of the ſhip. In this exigency, Quarll, being bold and active, took a hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et in his hand, and ran up the ſhrouds, by the captain's order, to cut away the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, which they could not lower; but by the time he had mounted, there came a ſea, which daſhed the ſhip againſt a rock, and, with the violence of the motion, flung Quarll, who was aſtride upon the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, on the top of the rock, where, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:030190_0103_0FE50564D7A89078"/>
the good fortune to fall into a clift, he was ſecured from being waſhed back again into the ſea and drowned, as all the reſt were that belonged to the ſhip.</p>
               <p>Quarll, in a diſmal condition, remained the ſucceeding night in the clift, being continually beaten with the daſhing back of the ſea, and being both bruiſed and numb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, pulled off his cloaths, which were drip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping wet, over fatigued, lays himſelf down on the ſmootheſt place of the rock he could find, being quite ſpent with the hardſhip he had undergone, and ſlept while his cloaths were drying.</p>
               <p>His ſleep, though very profound, was not refreſhing: the danger he had been lately in, ſo ran in his mind, that death was ever before his eyes, and conſtantly diſturbed his reſt: but nature, which wanted repoſe, would be ſupplied. Having ſlept a few hours, he awakes almoſt as much fatigued as before, and faint for want of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, having taken none for thirty-ſix hours before: ſo, having looked upon his cloaths, which he perceived were not quite dry, he turned the other ſide to the ſun, and laid himſelf down to ſleep again: but ſtill nothing but horror entered his mind.</p>
               <p>When he awoke, he was very much ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with his dreams, and ſtared about him in a frighted manner, expecting every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute ſome creature to devour him; but, taking a little courage, put on his cloaths, which by this time were quite dry. He then looks about him; but, alas! could ſee

nothing but the dreadful effects of the late tempeſt; dead corpſes, broken planks, and battered cheſts floating; and ſuch ſights as at once filled him with terror and grief.</p>
               <p>Turning from thoſe ſhocking objects, which preſented to his eyes the dreadful death he ſo lately had eſcaped, he ſees on the other ſide, the proſpect of one more terrible, hunger and thirſt, attended with all the miſeries that can make life burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Being ſeized with the terror of the threatening evil, he turns again towards the ſea, and looking on the dead corpſes, which the ſea now and then drove to the rock, and back again, <q>Oh! that I was like one of you, ſaid he, paſt all dangers! I have ſhared with you in the terrors of death: why did I not alſo partake with you in its relief? But why ſhould I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain? and have ſo much reaſon to be thankful! Had I been cut off, when the cares of ſaving this worthleſs carcaſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted me from ſeeking the ſalvation of my ſoul, I ſhould not have had the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent opportunity of taking care of it.</q> So, having returned thanks for his late de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, he reſigns himſelf to Providence, on whom he fully relies; climbs up the rock, and being come to the top, ſees land on the inſide, bearing both trees and graſs: <q>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be praiſed! ſaid he: I ſhall not periſh upon theſe barren rocks:</q> ſo made a ſhift to go down to it, the weather then being calm.</p>
               <p>Being come to the other ſide of the rock,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:030190_0105_0FE50569ABA98D20"/>
he finds at the bottom of it a narrow lake, which ſeparated it from the land: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, pulling off his cloaths, the water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but ſhallow, he wades over with them in his arms; and dreſſing himſelf, walks up a conſiderable way in the iſland, without ſeeing any human creature, or perceiving any ſign of its being inhabited, which ſtruck a great damp to his ſpirits. He walks it over and over, croſs-ways and long-ways; yet could ſee nothing but monkeys, ſtrange beaſts, birds, and fowls, ſuch as he had never ſeen before.</p>
               <p>Having ranged himſelf weary, he ſat down under a cluſter of trees, that made an agreeable arbour. The place being plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and cool, made, as it were, for repoſe, and he being ſtill very much fatigued, prompted him to lie down and ſleep, during which, his mind is continually alarmed with the frightful aſpect of grim death. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, he fancies himſelf ſtriving with the rolling waves, ſtretching out his arm to catch hold of a plank toſſing by; which, juſt come at, is beaten back by the roaring billows, whoſe terrible noiſe pronounces his death. At other times, he thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aſtride upon a piece of a maſt, labouring to keep himſelf on, and of a ſudden waſhed away, and ſunk down by a bulkey wave; on every ſide of him men calling for help; others ſpent and paſt ſpeaking; here ſome floating that are already periſhed, and there others expiring; thus, in every object, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his approaching fate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="unknown:030190_0106_0FE505735BCB14F0"/>
Being awaked out of that irkſome and uneaſy ſleep, he falls into as anxious and melancholy thoughts: <q>I have, ſaid he, eſcaped being drowned, but how ſhall I avoid ſtarving? here is no food for man. But why ſhould I deſpair? Cannot I eat graſs for a few days? by which time, Providence, which has hitherto protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, may raiſe me ſome means to get from hence.</q> So, being entirely reſigned, he walks about to ſee the iſland, which he found ſurrounded with rocks, at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of which there was a ſmall lake, which was fordable in moſt places, ſo that he could with eaſe wade over to the rock; which he did at every ſide of the iſland, to ſee if he could perceive any ſhip, whereby he might get away: but, ſeeing none, and it draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards night, he returns, and employs the remainder of the day in looking for the moſt convenient place for him to paſs away the approaching night; and, having fixed upon one of the higheſt trees, he gets up as far as he well could, fearing ſome wild beaſt might devour him if he ſlept below; where, having returned thanks to Heaven for his late great deliverance, he commits himſelf to its care; then ſettles, and falls to ſleep, and ſlept till hunger awaked him in the morning, having dreamt over night of abundance of victuals, which he would fain have come at, but was kept off by a croſs cook, who bid him go and fiſh for ſome. To which he anſwered, that he was ſhip-wrecked, and had nothing to fiſh withal.
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:030190_0107_0FE50574E51FC8C0"/>
"Well then," ſaid the cook to him again, <q>go where thou waſt like to loſe thy life, and there thou ſhalt find wherewithal to ſupport it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Being awaked, he makes reflexions upon his dream, which he imagined might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the emptineſs of his ſtomach, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cuſtomary for people to dream of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals when they go to bed hungry. But, driven by neceſſity, and led by curioſity, he went to the ſame ſide of the rock he had been caſt upon; where, having ſtood ſeveral hours without ſeeing ſhipping, or aught that might anſwer his dream, the air com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the ſea being pretty ſharp, and he faint, having taken no manner of food for near three days, he gave over all hopes of relief. Thus ſubmitting himſelf to the will of Heaven, which he ſuppoſed decreed a lingering death to puniſh him for his paſt ſins, he reſolves to return where he lay the night before, and there wait for his doom; but being ſtopped by a ſudden noiſe which iſſued from a creek in the rock, not far from where he ſtood, he had the curioſity to go and ſee what occaſioned it.</p>
               <p>Being come to the place he heard the noiſe proceed from, he ſees a fine large cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh, near ſix feet long, dabbling in a hole in the rock, where the late ſtorm had caſt it.</p>
               <p>One under condemnation of death, and juſt arrived at the place of execution, could not be more rejoiced at the coming of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve, than he was at the ſight of this fiſh, having felt ſeveral ſick qualms, fore-runners
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:030190_0108_0FE505766E6C1FF0"/>
of the death he thought he was doomed to. <q>Heaven be praiſed! ſaid he, here is ſubſiſtance for ſeveral days!</q>
               </p>
               <p>So, having taken off both his garters, he gets into the hole where the fiſh lay, and having run them through its gills, he hauls it out, and drags it after him, being heavy, and he very weak. Going along, he finds ſeveral oyſters, muſcles, and cockles, in his way, which the ſea had caſt up and down the rock; and having a knife about him, he ſat down and ate a few; ſo refreſhed himſelf, his ſpirits being exhauſted for want of food. This ſmall nutriment very much recruited his decayed ſtrength, and the thoughts of his ſupply of proviſion having diſperſed the dull ideas his late want had bred in his mind, he cheerfully takes his fiſh, which he drags with much more vigour than before; and filling his pocket with ſalt that was congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſun, which he found in the concavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the rock, away he goes to the place where he lay the night before, in order to dreſs ſome of the cod-fiſh; where being come, he picks up a parcel of dry leaves, and with his knife and a flint ſtruck fire, and kindled them: then getting together a few ſticks, made a fire preſently, and broiled a ſlice of his fiſh; of which he ate ſo heartily, that it overcame his ſtomach, being grown weak with faſting. Thus ſick, and out of order, he applies to the recourſe of the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which was lying down; and having much fatigued and harraſſed himſelf with
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:030190_0109_0FE50579C78EC4C8"/>
hauling the heavy fiſh up and down the rock, he fell aſleep until the next morning.</p>
               <p>Having ſlept quietly the remainder of the night, he awoke in the morning pretty freſh and hearty, but anxious about his future deſtiny; for though he might for a while ſubſiſt upon fiſh, wherewith he might be ſupplied by the ſea, yet he could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine which way he could be furniſhed with cloaths and bed againſt the winter; for want of which he muſt miſerably periſh with cold, unleſs ſupplied by ſome ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal accident as expoſed him to the want thereof, which he heartily wiſhes and prays may never happen.</p>
               <p>Having made theſe conſiderations, he, on his knees, returns kind Providence his hearty thanks for all its mercies that had been extended to him; begging the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of its aſſiſtance. Then, watching the opportunity of getting away from that melancholy place, he goes to the other ſide of the rock, to try if he could perceive any ſhipping in ſight.</p>
               <p>The wind being pretty high, fed his hopes, that each ſucceeding hour would gratify his wiſhing look, with that object the preceding could not bring forth: but he was diſappointed. The night approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, kept back all probability for that time; however, depending on better ſucceſs the next day, he returns whence he came: and being hungry, makes a fire, and broils an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſlice of the fiſh, then lays the reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on broad green leaves, and ſtrews ſalt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:030190_0110_0FE5058342D99958"/>
to keep it from ſpoiling, and then goes to reſt; and as he lay undiſturbed the night before under the trees, and much more eaſy than at top, he ventured again, committing himſelf to the care of Providence.</p>
               <p>He ſlept in ſafety that night; but with the returning morning, all his anxieties were renewed, and he determined to loſe no time in providing, as well as he could, for all his neceſſities. Accordingly, firſt he begins to think of making himſelf an houſe to preſerve him from the injuries of the weather: but having nothing to make it of, nor any inſtrument but a knife, which could be of little ſervice to him, he reſolves to go to that part of the rock where he was ſhipwrecked, to ſee if he could diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any thing among the wreck that might be ſerviceable to him: and therefore takes a branch of a tree along with him, and coming to the place, he ſtrips himſelf and goes into the water, (the water being low, diſcovering the tops of ſeveral ſharp-point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rocks), and gropes along with his ſtaff for ſure footing, wading as high as his chin, diving to the bottom frequently, and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about with his hands. This he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued doing for almoſt two hours, but to no purpoſe, not daring to go out of his depth; for he well knew that he could do little good there, becauſe he could diſcover no part of the ſhip, not ſo much as the maſt, or any of the rigging, but fancied ſhe lay in ſome deep hole, where it was impoſſible to get at her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="unknown:030190_0111_0FE505850F0C3410"/>
Thus deſpairing, and fretting and teaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, he calls to mind that he had a hatchet in his hand when he was caſt away, and thought probably it might lie in that clift of the rock into which he was thrown; thither he went, and looking about, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſomething like the handle of a hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet, juſt above the ſurface of the water, at the bottom of the rock; and going down to it, took it up; which, to his great joy, proved to be the very thing he wanted.</p>
               <p>Having got his tool, he dreſſes himſelf, and goes on to the iſland again, intending to cut down ſome trees to make himſelf a hut; looking about, therefore, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt plants, and taking notice of a ſort of trees, whoſe branches, bending to the ground, took root, and became a plant, he thought they might be the fitteſt for this purpoſe, and cut a ſufficient parcel of them to make his barrack; which was full buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for him that day.</p>
               <p>The next morning, having paid his uſual devotion, he walks out again to look for a pleaſant and convenient place to make his hut or barrack upon. He walked ſeveral hours, and could find none more ſheltered from the cold winds than that where he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready lay, being in the middle of the iſland, well fenced on the north and eaſt ſides with trees, which ſtood very thick. The place being fixed upon, he hews down ſome trees that grew in his way, and clears a ſpot of ground about twelve feet ſquare, leaving one tree ſtanding at each corner; and, with
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:030190_0112_0FE5058699AC28A8"/>
the young plants he provided the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, filled the diſtance between quite round, ſetting them about ſix inches aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, leaving a larger vacancy for the door. His incloſure being made, he bends the branches at the top from both ſides, and weaves them acroſs one another, making a cover to it, which being ſomething too thin, he laid other branches over, till they were grown thicker. Having finiſhed the top, he goes about cloſing the ſides; for which purpoſe, taking large branches, he ſtrips off their ſmall twigs, and weaves them between the plants as they do for ſheep-pens, then made a door after the ſame manner.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>His barrack being finiſhed, which took him up fifteen days hard work, "Now," ſaid he, <q>here is a houſe, but where is the
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:030190_0113_0FE50589CCA6B178"/>
furniture? This, indeed, may keep the weather from me, but not the cold. The ground on which I do and muſt lie, is hard, and, doubtleſs, in the winter, will grow damp, which, with want of cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering, may occaſion agues and fevers, the cholic and rheumatiſm, and twenty racking diſtempers, which may cauſe me to repent my having eſcaped a milder death.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this great conſternation and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he goes to ſee if he could ſpy any ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping riding within ſight of the iſland. As he was walking along, full of heavy and dull thoughts, which weighed his looks to the ground, he happened to find a ſort of high graſs, that grows but here and there, round ſome particular ſort of trees, of which he never took notice before. <q>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be praiſed! ſaid he, I have found wherewithal to keep my poor body from the ground, whilſt I am, by Providence, doomed to remain here.</q> So paſſes on, intending at his return to cut down a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity of it to make mats that might ſerve him inſtead of bed and bed-cloaths.</p>
               <p>Having looked himſelf almoſt blind, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing the leaſt proſpect of what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, he concludes upon going to cut the graſs which he ſtood in ſuch want of, and ſpread it to dry, whilſt the weather was yet warm. That piece of work kept him employed the remainder of the day, and beſt part of the ſucceeding, having nothing but a pocket-knife to cut withal. That work
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:030190_0114_0FE5058F0FEDD5C8"/>
being done, wanting a tool to ſpread and turn his graſs, he takes a branch off the next tree, which, having ſtript of all the ſmall ones about it, all but part of that at the top, made a tolerable fork. Thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equipt for hay-making, he went on with his work; and as he was at it, he ſaw, at ſome diſtance, ſeveral monkeys as buſy as himſelf, ſcratching ſomething out of the ground, which they eat in part upon the ſpot, and carried the reſt to their home.</p>
               <p>His hopes that thoſe roots might be for his uſe, thoſe creatures being naturally dainty, eating nothing but what men may, made him haſten to the place he ſaw them ſcratching at, that by the herb they they bear (which they tore off), he might find out the root.</p>
               <p>Having, by the leaves which he picked off the ground, found ſome of the ſame, he digs them up, and carried them to his barrack; where he broiled a ſlice of fiſh, and in the aſhes roaſted them, which cat ſomething like cheſnuts, done in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>This new found-out eatable much rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. He returned his hearty thanks to kind Providence, that had put him in a way to provide himſelf with bread, and that of a moſt delicious kind. As ſoon, therefore, as he had dined, he went out on purpoſe to dig up a good quantity: but, as he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the place where he had taken notice they grew pretty thick, he ſees a tortoiſe, of about a foot over, crawling before him:
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:030190_0115_0FE50594654317D0"/>
"Heaven be praiſed!" ſaid he, <q>here is what will ſupply me both with victuals and utenſils to dreſs it in.</q> He ran, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and turned it on its back, to keep it from getting away, whilſt he went for his hatchet, that he might cut the bottom ſhell from the top, in order to make a kettle of the deepeſt, and a diſh of the flat part.</p>
               <p>Being tired of cod-fiſh, he dreſſes the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe, an animal ſeldom eaten but upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, the fleſh thereof often giving the flux: nevertheleſs, he ventured upon it, and liked it extremely, ſome part of it eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very much like veal; which at that time was a very great novelty to him, having eaten no freſh meat for a long time before.</p>
               <p>Happening to eat of that part of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe which is the moſt ſeeding and leaſt hurtful, he was in no wiſe diſcompoſed; but having boiled it all, he laid by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, to eat now and then between his fiſh.</p>
               <p>Being provided with a boiling utenſil, he often had change, by means of thoſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable roots ſo lucikly diſcovered; ſome of which he roaſted for bread, others he boiled with ſaltcod. This, in a great meaſure, miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated his misfortune, and ſoftened the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip he lay under; ſo that, ſeeing but little proſpect of changing his preſent condition, by getting away from thence yet a while, he thinks on means to make it as eaſy as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble whilſt he remained in it; for, having projected a bed, and taking the graſs, which by that time was dry, he falls to work; and
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:030190_0116_0FE50595F07741D0"/>
a mat being the thing concluded upon, he twiſts his hay into ropes, the bigneſs of his leg; then he cuts a pretty number of ſticks, about two feet long, which he drives into the ground, ten in a row, and near four inches aſunder, and oppoſite to them ſuch another row at ſix or ſeven feet diſtance from the firſt, which made the length of his mat; then having faſtened one end of his rope to one of the corner ſticks, he brings it round the other corner ſtick, and ſo to the next at the other end, till he has laid his frame; then he weaves acroſs ſhorter ropes of the ſame, in the manner they make pallions on board ſhips with old cable ends. When he had finiſhed his mat, he beat it with a long ſtick, which made it ſwell up; and the graſs being of a ſoft cottony nature, he had a warm and eaſy bed to lie on.</p>
               <p>The comfort and pleaſure he found on his ſoft mat (being grown ſore with lying on the ground for a ſpace of a month or more) ſo liberally gratified him for the time and labour he had beſtowed in making it, that it gave him encouragement to go about ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a covering being the next neceſſary wanted; for though the weather was as yet pretty warm, and he in a great meaſure ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by the hardſhip he had gone through; yet the winter approaching, and the preſent ſeaſon being ſtill favourable for him to make proviſion againſt it, he goes and cuts more graſs, which being made ready for uſe, he lengthens his loom, to allow for rolling up at one end, inſtead of a bolſter, and makes
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:030190_0117_0FE5059953619BE0"/>
it thicker than the firſt, which he intends, in cold weather, ſhall lie upon him inſtead of blankets.</p>
               <p>Being provided with the moſt neceſſary furniture he wanted, he thinks on more conveniences, reſolving to make himſelf a table to eat his victuals upon, and a chair to ſit on. Thus, having cut ſeveral ſticks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four feet long, he drives them in a row a little way in the ground, then takes ſmaller, which he interweaves between; having made the top, he ſets it upon four other ſticks, forky at the upper end, which he ſtuck in the ground at one ſide of his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rack, to the height of a table: this being done, he cuts four more branches, ſuch as he judged would do beſt for the ſeat and back of a chair, which he alſo drove in the ground near his table; and having twiſted the branches, which grew to them, with each other, from back to front, and acroſs again, he weaves ſmaller between, bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſeat; which completes the furniture of his habitation.</p>
               <p>That care being over, another ſucceeds, of a far greater moment: <q>Here is a dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaid he, to ſhelter me from the weather, and a bed to reſt this poor body of mine; but where is food to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it? Here I have ſubſiſted near one month upon a fiſh, which the ſame dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtorm, that took away forty lives, ſent me to maintain my own. Well, ſince kind Providence has been pleaſed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my life preferable to ſo many, who
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:030190_0118_0FE505A453E308B0"/>
fatally periſhed in that diſmal accident, I am bound, in gratitude, to hold it precious; and ſince my fiſh is almoſt gone, and I am not certain of more, I muſt by degrees bring myſelf to live upon roots, which I hope will never be wanting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the natural product of this iſland: ſo I muſt eat of the ſmall remnant of my fiſh but now and then, to make it hold out the longer. Dainties or plenty were not allotted for him that was doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſlavery, but labour and hard living; and, if I meet here the latter, Heaven be praiſed, I have eſcaped the worſe; I can take my reſt, and ſtand in no dread of any ſevere inſpector or taſkmaſter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now being entirely reconciled to the ſtate of life, Providence, on whom he fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, had been pleaſed to call him to, he reſolves to make proviſion of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent roots; and with his hatchet he cuts a piece of a tree, wherewith he makes a ſhovel, in order to dig them up with more caſe: with this inſtrument he went to the place where he obſerved they grew thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, which being near the monkeys' quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they came down from off their trees in great numbers, grinning as if they would have flown at him; which made him ſtop awhile. He might, indeed, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in his hand, have killed ſeveral, and perhaps diſperſed the reſt; but would not: "Why," ſaid he, "ſhould I add bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity to injuſtice? It is but natural and reaſonable for all creatures to guard and
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:030190_0119_0FE505A624754468"/>
defend their own: this was given them by nature for food, which I am come to rob them of: and ſince I am obliged to get of them for my ſubſiſtence, if I am decreed to be here another ſeaſon, I will ſet ſome in a place diſtant from theirs for my own uſe."</p>
               <p>Having ſtood ſtill a conſiderable time, thoſe animals, ſeeing he did not go forwards, each went and ſcratched up for itſelf, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards retiring; giving him the opportunity to dig up a few for himſelf: and as he was not come to the place where they grew thick, he laid them in ſmall heaps as he dug them up; while thoſe ſly creatures would, whilſt he was digging up more, come down from the trees where they ſtood hid among the leaves, and ſteal them away; which obliged him to be contented for that time with as many as his pockets would hold, reſolving to bring ſomething next time which would contain a larger quantity; and fearing thoſe animals, which are naturally very cunning, ſhould dig them up, and hide them, he comes early the morning follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make his proviſion; and for want of a ſack to put them in, he takes his jacket, which he buttons up, and ties at the ſleeves; and as he had obſerved, that every root had abundance of little off-ſets hanging at it by ſmall fibres, he pulled off his ſhirt alſo, of which he makes another ſack, to put them in.</p>
               <p>Being naked, all but his breeches, and the day being pretty hot, he thought he had as good pull them off too, and fill them, his

jacket being but ſhort, and therefore hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but few; taking, therefore, his bundle in one arm, and having the ſhovel in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, he goes to the place he intended to go the day before; and expecting to find the ſame oppoſition as he did then, he brought with him ſome of the roots he had dug up the preceding day, in order to throw them amongſt thoſe animals, and ſo quiet them; but to his great wonder, and as great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, thoſe creatures, which the time before had oppoſed him with noiſe and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive motions, let him now paſs by quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without offering to meddle with any when dug up, though he had laid them up by heaps in their way, and ſtood at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance from them.</p>
               <p>This ſurpriſing reverence from thoſe creatures ſet him upon deep reflexions on what could be the cauſe thereof; whether it might not proceed from the proximity of their ſhape and his: "but, then," ſaid he, "my ſtature and colour of ſkin is ſo different from theirs, that they cannot but diſtinguiſh I am not of their kind: no, it muſt be a remnant of that awe, entailed by Nature upon all animals, to that moſt noble and complete maſter-piece of the creation, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man, which, now appearing in the ſtate he was firſt created in, and undiſguiſed by cloaths, renews an image of that reſpect he has forfeited by his fatal tranſgreſſion, which ever ſince obliged him to hide the beauty of his fabric under a gaudy diſguiſe, which often renders him ridiculous to the reſt of
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:030190_0121_0FE505A94257CAE0"/>
mankind, and generally obnoxious to all other creatures; making a pride of what he ought to be aſhamed of. Well, adds he, ſince my cloaths bred the antipathy, I will remove that cauſe, which will ſuit both the nature of thoſe animals, and my own circumſtances." From that time he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to go naked, till the hardneſs of the weather obliged him to put ſomething on.</p>
               <p>Having picked up a ſufficient quantity of off-ſets to ſtock about two acres of land, he returns home, leaving behind him a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable quantity of roots dug up for thoſe poor animals, who attended him all the time he was at work, without offering to touch one till he was gone.</p>
               <p>Being come home, he fixes upon a ſpot of ground near his habitation, and digs it up as well as he could with his wooden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, in order to ſow his ſeed; which having compaſſed in about twenty days, he implores a bleſſing upon his labour, and leaves it to time to bring it forth. Thus having finiſhed the moſt neceſſary work about his barrack, he reſolves to take a more particular view of the iſland, which till then he had not time to do; and take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a long ſtaff in his hand, he walks to the lake, which parts the land from the rock, and goes along the ſide of it quite round the iſland, finding all the way new ſubjects of admiration: on the left hand ſtood a rampart made of one ſolid ſtone, adorned by nature with various forms and ſhapes, beyond the power of art to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate;
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:030190_0122_0FE505B560888D60"/>
ſome parts challenging a likeneſs to a city, and cluſters of houſes, with here and there a high ſteeple ſtanding above the other buildings: another place claiming a near reſemblance to a diſtant fleet of ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, with their reſpective ſignals flying, coming into port: farther, it bears compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the dull remains of ſome ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous edifice, ruined by the often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhocks of time, inciting the beholders to condolence for the loſs of its former beauty. At ſome diſtance from thence the proſpect of a demoliſhed city is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſight: in another place large ſtones, like ſmall mountains, laid as it were, a-top of one another, impreſs the mind with an idea of the tower of Babel; and on the right hand a moſt pleaſant land, covered with beautiful green graſs, like chamomile, and here and there a cluſter of trees, compoſing moſt agreeable groves, amongſt a vaſt number of fine lofty trees, of divers heights and ſhapes, which ſtood more diſtant, whoſe irregularity added to the delightfulneſs of the place.</p>
               <p>As he was walking on, admiring all theſe wonderful works of nature, having caught cold (not being uſed to go naked), he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to ſneeze oppoſite to a place in the rock, which hollowed in after the manner of the inſide of ſome cathedral, and was anſwered by a multitude of different voices iſſuing from that place. The agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſurpriſe induced him to rouſe thoſe echoes a ſecond time, by giving a
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:030190_0123_0FE505B925496900"/>
loud hem; which was, like his ſneezing, repeated in different tones, but all very harmonious; again he hem'd, and was ſo delighted with the repetition, that he could have ſpent hours in the hearing of it. <q>But why ſhould I, ſaid he, waſte thoſe melodious ſounds, ſo ſit to relate the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's wonderful works, and ſet forth his praiſe?</q> Immediately he ſang ſeveral pſalms and hymns with as much emulation and devotion, as if he had been in company with numbers of ſkilful and celebrated cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſters.</p>
               <p>Having ſpent a conſiderable time there with much pleaſure, he proceeds in his walk, being reſolved to make that his place of worſhip for the future, and attend it twice a day conſtantly.</p>
               <p>About three or four hundred paces far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, having turned on the other ſide of a jetting out part of the rock, he was ſtopt a ſecond time by another ſurpriſing product of nature; a large ſtone, growing out of the rock, advancing quite over the lake at the bottom of it, repreſenting ſomething of a human ſhape, out of the breaſt whereof iſſued a fountain of exceeding clear water, as ſweet as milk; and, when looked at fronting, was like an antique piece of arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itecture, which in old times they built over particular ſprings; and on the other ſide appeared as if ſpringing from the noſtrils of a ſea horſe. Theſe three ſo very different and yet rightly compared likeneſſes, being offered by one and the ſame unaltered ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:030190_0124_0FE505BAB50303B0"/>
made him curious to examine what parts of every reſemblance helped to make the others; and having ſpent a conſiderable time in the examination, he found every thing, which the front had likeneſs of, was employed in making the ſide repreſentation, by being in ſome places ſhortened, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lengthened, according to the point of ſight.</p>
               <p>Being ſatisfied about that ſubject, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon another as puzzling: the baſon in which the fountain ran, which was about five yards diſtant from whence the water did ſpring, being but about nine feet over every way, without any viſible place to evacuate its over complement, and yet keeping the ſame height, without daſhing or running over, although the ſtream that fell into it ran as big as his wriſt. Having a long time ſearched into the cauſe, without any ſatisfaction, he conjectures it muſt make its way out ſomewhere under ground; ſo went on, till he came to the place he had begun his march at, which ended that day's work.</p>
               <p>Having been round the iſland, which, to the beſt of his judgment. was about ten or eleven miles in circumference, of an oblong form, going in and out in ſeveral places, extending from north to ſouth, the ſouth end near twice as broad as the oppoſite; he reſolves to employ the next day in viewing the inſide.</p>
               <p>So the next morning he walks along the land, which he found very level, covered
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:030190_0125_0FE5070F06DAE9D0"/>
with a delightful green graſs, and adorned with trees of divers ſorts, ſhapes and height, inhabited with ſeveral ſorts of curious ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing birds, of various colours and notes, which entertained him with their melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous harmony. In ſome places ſtood a cluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of trees, compoſing agreeable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful groves, proceeding from only one main body, whoſe lower branches, being come to a certain length, applied to the earth for immediate nouriſhment, as it were, to eaſe the old ſtem that produced them; and ſo became a plant, and did the ſame.</p>
               <p>Having for ſome time admired the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs and curioſity of the plant, by which nature ſeemed to give human kind inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and looking about, if perchance he could find any thing in his way for his own proper uſe, he took along with him a ſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of every different herb he thought might be eatable. Croſſing the iſland in ſeveral places, he comes at a moſt delightful pond, about two hundred yards in length, and one hundred and fifty wide, with fine trees ſpreading their branchy limbs over its brink, which was ſurrounded with a beautiful bank, covered with divers kinds of flowers and herbs, ſo naturally intermixed, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted it in ornament and conveniency, as though intended by nature for more than mortal's uſe.</p>
               <p>Having walked ſeveral times round it with much pleaſure, he ſat down a while upon its bank, to admire the clearneſs of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, through which, to his great comfort,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:030190_0126_0FE505BC44235768"/>
he ſaw many different ſorts of fiſh, of various ſizes, ſhapes, and colours. <q>Heaven be praiſed! ſaid he, here is a ſtock of freſh water fiſh to ſupply me with food, if the ſea ſhould fail me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Being ſufficiently diverted with their chaſing one another, which were of many beautiful and different colours, and a moſt delightful ſcene, he proceeds in his walk, and goes to the ſouth of the iſland, where he finds another ſubject of admiration, a noble and ſpacious wood, whoſe ſhades ſeemed to be made for the abode of peace and pleaſure. He walked round it with much delight, which made the time ſeem ſhort; yet he could gueſs it to be no leſs than two miles about.</p>
               <p>Having viewed the outſide, whoſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary agreeableneſs incited in him an unſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable deſire to get into it, but where he was afraid to venture, leſt there might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive creatures; yet, having recommended himſelf to the care of Providence, he ventured into it, finding ſeveral pleaſant walks, ſome ſtraight, edged with lofty trees, as though plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for pleaſure; others crooked and winding, bordered with a thick hedge of pimentoes, which caſt a moſt fragrant ſmell; here and there a large cluſter of buſhes and dwarf trees, wherein ſheltered ſeveral different kinds of wild beaſts and fowls: <q>Sure, ſaid he, this iſland never was intended by nature to lie waſte, but rather reſerved to be the happy abode of ſome, for whom Heaven had a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar bleſſing in ſtore. Here is every thing ſufficient, not only for the ſupport, but alſo
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:030190_0127_0FE505C8D2C7C8F8"/>
for the pleaſure of life: Heaven make me thankful, that I am the happy inhabitant of ſo bleſſed a land!</q>
               </p>
               <p>Being hungry, and tired with walking, he goes home in order to get ſome victuals, and having made a fire, he boils a ſlice of his ſalt fiſh with ſome roots, and then the herbs he brought with him, which proved of divers taſtes, and all excellent; ſome eating like artichoaks, others like aſparagus and ſpinach. <q>Now, ſaid he, what can I wiſh for more! Here I poſſeſs a plentiful land, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces both fleſh and fiſh; bears excellent greens and roots, and affords the beſt of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which by nature was ordained for man's drink. Pomp and greatneſs are but pagean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which oftentimes prove more prejudicial to the actor, than diverting to the beholder; eaſe and indulgence are apt to breed the gout, and various diſtempers, which make the rich more wretched than the poor; now theſe evils, thanks to my Maker! I ſtand in no danger of, having but what is ſufficient, which never can do any harm.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus thoroughly eaſy in his mind, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to ſpend the afternoon at the outſide of the rock, in viewing the ſea, and looking for oyſters; ſo takes in his hand his long ſtaff to grapple in holes; and his breeches which he ties at the knees, to bring them in. Being come to a place of the rock he had never been at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he ſees at a diſtance ſomething like linen hanging upon it, which, when he come at, he found to be the main-ſail of a ſhip, with a piece of the yard faſtened to it: "Alas!" ſaid
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:030190_0128_0FE505CA861F3AF0"/>
he, <q>a diſmal token of inſatiable ambition! which makes men often loſe their lives in ſeeking what they ſeldom find; and, if they ever do, 'tis commonly attended with a world of care. Happy is he who limits his deſires to his ability, aſpiring not above his reach, and is contented with what nature requires.</q> Then he falls a ripping the ſheet from the yard, which he finds in one place tied with one of his garters, (having himſelf made uſe of it for want of another ſtring) <q>Heaven be praiſed! ſaid he, this is no effect of another ſhipwreck, but a fragment of the unfortunate ſhip, whoſe loſs was my redemption;</q> which reflexion made him ſhed tears.</p>
               <p>Having ripped the ſail in pieces, he rolls them in ſuch bundles as he could conveniently carry, and lays them down till he had got a few oyſters, proceeding to grope in holes with his ſtick as he went on.</p>
               <p>About forty paces farther, he finds a cheſt in the clift of a rock, which had been waſhed up there by the violence of the late ſtorm:—<q>Heaven! ſaid he, more fatal effects of fate's cruelty and man's temerity! Was the ſea made for men to travel on? Is there not land enough for his rambling mind to rove? Muſt he hunt after dangers, and put death to defiance? What is the owner of this the better for it now? Or who can be the better in a place ſo remote, and the acceſs to it ſo difficult? being not to be approached but on the wings of Providence, and over the back of death. Now, was this full of maſſy gold, or yet richer things, I thank my God, I am
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:030190_0129_0FE505CC5027C9B8"/>
above the uſe of it; yet I'll take it home: it was ſent hither by Providence, perhaps for the relief of ſome ſo neceſſitated and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.</q> Then going to lift it, he could not; therefore was obliged to fetch his hatchet to beat it open that he might take away what was in it by degrees. Having taken as much of the ſail cloth as he could conveniently carry, with the few oyſters he had got, he went home and fetched the tool, wherewith he wrenched the cheſt open, from which he took a ſuit of cloaths and ſome wearing linen: "Theſe," ſaid he, "neither the owner nor I want;" ſo laid them down; the next thing he took out was a roll of ſeveral ſheets of parchment, being blank indentures and leaſes: <q>Theſe, ſaid he, are inſtruments of the law, and often applied to injuſtice; but I'll alter their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous properties, and make them records of Heaven's mercies, and Providence's won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful liberality to me; ſo, inſtead of being the ruin of ſome, they may chance to be the reclaiming of others.</q> At the bottom of the cheſt lay a runlet of brandy, a Cheſhire cheeſe, a leather bottle full of ink, with a parcel of pens, and a penknife: <q>As for theſe, ſaid he, they are of uſe; the pens, ink, and parchment have equipped me to keep a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, which will divert and paſs away a few anxious hours: as for the cheeſe and brandy, they will but cauſe me new cares: before I had them, I wanted them not: now, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and comfort I ſhall find in them, when gone, will make me hanker after them more, I wiſh I had ſtill been without them; but now
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:030190_0130_0FE505CDDB2D9C70"/>
they are here, it would be a ſin to let them be loſt. I'll take them home, and only uſe them at my need; which will both make them hold out the longer, and me grow leſs fond of them.</q>
               </p>
               <figure/>
               <p>So, by degrees, he takes home the cheſt, and what was in it; and now having materials to begin his journal, he immediately fell to work, that for want of other books, he might, at his leiſure, peruſe his paſt tranſactions, and the many mercies he had received from Heaven; and that, after his deceaſe, whoever is directed thither by Providence, upon reading his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful eſcapes in the greateſt of dangers; his miraculous living, when remote from human aſſiſtance; in the extremity, might not deſpair. Thus he begins from his being eight years old (as well as he can remember, he heard an old aunt of his ſay) to the day of his being caſt
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:030190_0131_0FE505D9511D5CE8"/>
away, being then twenty-eight years of age, reſolving to continue it to his death.</p>
               <p>He now reſolves to make proviſion againſt winter, and the ſeaſon being pretty far advanced, he gathers a good ſtore of fuel and roots; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to line the outſide of his barrack with a wall of turf, and lays the ſame at top, to keep out the wet. And as he now and then found ſmall ſhell-fiſh and oyſters upon the rock, he makes a bridge over the lake, which in warm weather he uſed to wade, that in the winter he might go over dry. So, having completed his bridge, which was made of two ſtrong poles, which reached from the land to the rock, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral leſſer-branches laid acroſs pretty cloſe, he retires home, the day being far ſpent. The following night there aroſe a violent ſtorm, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with dreadful claps of thunder, which the many echoes from the rock rendered more terrible; and lightnings flaſhing in a moſt frightful manner, ſucceeding each other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the preceding was well out of the ſky, which put poor loneſome Quarll in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, that notwithſtanding his reliance on Heaven's protection, he would have given the world (had it been in his poſſeſſion) to have been within the reach of human aſſiſtance; or at leaſt to have had ſome company; ſolitude adding much to his terror and affliction.</p>
               <p>The glorious riſing of the next morning's ſun having laid the mortifying rage of the bluſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing winds, Quarll, whoſe late alarm was hardly quelled, ſtill ſuſpecting its moſt reviving rays to be terrifying glances and flaſhes of lightning; but having lain awhile, and hearing no noiſe,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:030190_0132_0FE505DAE95BC0D8"/>
but that which ſtill raged in his mind, was at laſt convinced the ſtorm was over; and ſo gets up with a reſolution to go and ſee if he could diſcern any effect of the late tempeſt.</p>
               <p>Being come at the other ſide of the rock, he ſaw indeed ſurpriſing objects, but not afflicting; the miſchief that was done, being to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the ſea only, a vaſt number of which had, by the wind, been diſelemented; a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſtately whitings, fine mackerels, large herrings, divers ſizes of codlings, and ſeveral other ſorts of fiſh, with a great number of ſhells, of different ſhapes and bigneſſes, lying up and down upon the rock. <q>Heaven be praiſed! ſaid he, inſtead of damage to bewail, what thanks have I now to return for this mighty benefit! Here the powerful agent of miſchief is, by kind Providence, made a miniſter of good to me: make me thankful! I am now provided for all the next winter; and yet longer; by which time I am certain to have a freſh ſupply.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus having taken up as many fiſh as he could hold in his arms, he carries them home, and brings his ſhirt, which he uſed inſtead of a ſack; ſo, at ſeveral times, he brought away all the fiſh, and as many of the ſhells as he had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for; of ſome of which he made boilers and ſtewpans; of others, diſhes and plates; ſome he kept water in, and others fiſh in pickle; ſo that he was ſtocked with neceſſary veſſels as well as proviſion.</p>
               <p>Being very weary with often going back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards with his fiſh, which took up all that day to bring them home, he ſits
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:030190_0133_0FE505DC74470A98"/>
down to reſt himſelf; and the runlet of brandy lying by, he was tempted to take a ſup, which was at that time very much wanted, his ſpirits being very low; but was loth to taſte it, leſt he ſhould grow fond of the liquor, and grieve after it when gone: ſome moments were ſpent before he could come to a reſolution; at laſt, having conſidered the uſe of it, which ſuited the preſent occaſion, he concludes to take a dram, and to uſe it like a cordial, which it was firſt intended for; but the veſſel out of which he drank, being at his mouth, the cordial turns to a nectar; one gulph decoys another down; ſo the intended dram became a hearty draught. The pleaſantneſs of the liquor made him forget its nature; ſo that poor Quarll, who had, for the ſpace of near three months before, drank nothing but water, was preſently overcome with the ſtrength of the brandy, and fell aſleep in his chair, with the runlet on his bare lap, from whence it ſoon fell to the ground, and, being unſtopt, ran all out.</p>
               <p>Being awaked with hunger, having ſlept from evening till almoſt noon of another day, which he knew not whether the ſucceeding or the next to it; ſeeing what had happened, he was ſorely vexed, and could have wept at the accident; but, conſidering the liquor which occaſioned it, might perhaps, in time, have cauſed greater miſchief, he was ſoon reconciled to the loſs, but could not with that of the right order of the days, which having entirely forgot, hindered the going on of his journal; ſo was obliged to make only a memorial. That da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage being repaired, another appears of a far
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:030190_0134_0FE505DE033559A0"/>
greater conſequence; the Sunday is loſt, which he had ſo carefully obſerved to that time:—how can that be made up? <q>Now, ſaid he, ſhall I daily be in danger of breaking the ſabbath, knowing not the day. O fatal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor! that ever thou wert invented to cauſe ſo much miſchief! But why ſhould I lay the blame upon the uſe, when it is the abuſe that does the hurt? and exclaim againſt a thing, which being taken in moderation is of ſo great a benefit, reviving a fainting heart, raiſing ſinking ſpirits, warming cold and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed nature, and aſſuaging ſeveral pains.</q> So blames himſelf highly for gratifying his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite with that wherewith he only ought to have refreſhed nature; and ſince that often miſguided faculty had prompted him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the fault, he dedicated that day, in which he became ſenſible of it, to prayers and faſting; and every ſeventh from that he ſets apart for divine worſhip only, which he hoped would keep him from breaking the commandments for keeping holy the ſabbath day: ſo went to the place where the echoes, in many different and melodious ſounds, repeated his thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Almighty, which he had fixed upon to pay his devotion, and there ſpent the reſt of the day in prayers and ſinging of pſalms.</p>
               <p>The next morning, having breakfaſted with ſome of his uſual bread, and a ſlice of the cheeſe he found in the cheſt, he goes about curing his fiſh, in order to ſalt them; having laid by as many, for the preſent uſe, as he thought he could eat whilſt freſh, he improves
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:030190_0135_0FE505EE19866C80"/>
the fair weather, to dry one part of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, and keeps the reſt in pickle.</p>
               <p>The winter being neat at hand, and the weather growing damp and cold, hinders him from taking his walks; ſo being confined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doors, he employs his idle hours in beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his utenſils, which were not to be uſed on the fire; and beſtowed ſome pains in ſcrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and poliſhing the reſt of his ſhells, ſome as fine as though they had been nakers of pearl; which made them not only more fit for their intended uſes, but alſo a great ornament to his barrack, which he ſhelved round with plaited twigs after the manner of his table, and ſo ſet them upon it.</p>
               <p>Thus he ſpent the beſt part of the winter, making no farther remarks, but that it was very ſharp, attended with high winds, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of nail and ſnow, which obliged him to make a broom to ſweep it away from about his hut, which otherwiſe would have been damaged by it.</p>
               <p>But ſhivering Winter having exhauſted his froſty ſtores, and weary with vexing nature, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired; Boreas alſo, grown faint with hard blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is forced to retreat into his cave; gentle Zephyrus (who till then kept up in his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate cell) now comes forth to uſher in the blooming ſpring; ſo mildly ſlips on to inform Nature of her favourite's approach, who at the joyful news puts on her gay enamelled garb, and out of her rich wardrobe ſupplies all vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables with new veſture, to welcome the lovely gueſt. The feathered choriſters alſo receive new ſtrength; their tender lungs are repaired
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:030190_0136_0FE505EFA56AEF08"/>
from the injuries the foggy and miſty air did occaſion; and, thus revived, are placed on every budding tree, to grace his entrance with their harmonious notes.</p>
               <p>Quarll alſo, whom bad weather had confined within doors a conſiderable time, which had in a great meaſure numbed his limbs, and dulled his ſenſes, now finds himſelf quite revived: he no longer can keep within; the fair weather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites him out; the ſinging birds on every ſide call to him; nature itſelf fetches him out to behold her treaſures.</p>
               <p>Having with unſpeakable pleaſure walked ſome time, diverted with the ſweet melody of various ſinging birds, and the ſight of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of different ſorts of bloſſomed trees, and blooming flowers; all things within the iſland inſpiring joy; he had the curioſity to go and view the ſea; ſo goes over his bridge; and then, at the other ſide of the rock, where he finds more objects, requiring as much admiration, but affording a great deal leſs pleaſure; vaſt mountains of ice, floating up and down, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all that came in their way.</p>
               <p>Theſe terrible effects of the winter, which to that time he was a ſtranger to, occaſioned his making theſe reflexions:
<q>
                     <l>He who on billows roves, riches or wealth to gain,</l>
                     <l>Is ever in danger, and labours oft in vain;</l>
                     <l>If fortune on him ſmiles, giving his toil ſucceſs,</l>
                     <l>Each day new cares ariſe, which mar his happineſs.</l>
                     <l>The only treaſure then worth laying up in ſtore,</l>
                     <l>Is a contented mind which never leaves one poor;</l>
                     <l>He is not truly rich who hankers after more.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="unknown:030190_0137_0FE505F12E0D8918"/>
So, having returned Heaven thanks for his happy ſtate, he creeps to the north-eaſt ſide of the rock, at the foot of which lay an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary large whale, which the late high wind had caſt there, and died for want of water. <q>If this, ſaid he, is all the damage that has been done laſt winter, it may be borne;</q> ſo went down and meaſured the length of it, which was above thirty yards, and proportionable in bigneſs: there were ſhoals of ſmall fiſhes ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming about it in the ſhallow water wherein it lay, as rejoicing at its death. <q>Thus, ſaid he, the oppreſſed rejoice at a tyrant's fall. What numbers of theſe have been deſtroyed to make this monſtrous bulk of fat! Well, happy are they, who, like me, are under Heaven's government only.</q> So with his knife, which he always carried in his pocket, cuts ſeveral ſlices of the whale, and throws them to the ſmall fiſhes, ſaying, <q>It is but juſt you ſhould at laſt feed on that which ſo long fed on you;</q> as oil ran, in abundance, from the places he had cut the ſlices out of, it vexed him to ſee that waſted, which might turn to good money: <q>But why, ſaid he, ſhould I be diſturbed at it? What uſe have I for any? Providence takes none, it gives me all gratis.</q> So goes on feeling for oyſters with his ſtaff, which he always walked with.</p>
               <p>Having at laſt found a hole, where by their rattling at the bottom with his ſtaff, he judged there might be a pretty many, he marks the place, and goes home to contrive ſome inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to drag them up, being yet too cold for him to go in the water; and as he had no tool
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:030190_0138_0FE505F2C0AE6488"/>
but his knife and hatchet, both improper to make a hole in a board, as requiſite to make a rake, which was wanting for that purpoſe; he beats out the end of his cheſt, in which there was a knot: ſo having driven it out, he faſtens the ſmall end of a pole to it. Thus equipped, he went and raked up oyſters, which added one diſh to his ordinary, and ſauce to others; yet at length his ſtomach growing qualmiſh with eating altogether fiſh, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but water withal, he wiſhes he could have a little fleſh, which he might eaſily, there being animals enough in the wood apparently fit for food; but then he muſt deprive them of their lives, barely to make his own more eaſy.</p>
               <p>Thus he debates with himſelf for ſome time, whether or no it would not be injuſtice for him (who only by a providential accident was brought thither to ſave his life) now to deſtroy thoſe creatures, to whom nature had given a being, in a land out of man's reach to diſturb: yet nature requires what ſeems to be againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for me to grant: I am faint, and like to grow worſe, the longer I abſtain from fleſh.</p>
               <p>Having pauſed a while; <q>Why, ſaid he, ſhould I be ſo ſcrupulous? Were not all things created for the uſe of man? Now, whether it is not worſe to let a man periſh, than to deſtroy any other creature for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief? Nature craves it, and Providence gives it: now, not to uſe it in neceſſity, is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing the gift.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So, having concluded upon catching ſome of thoſe animals he had ſeen in the wood, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders by what means, having no dogs to hunt,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:030190_0139_0FE506009FC98320"/>
nor guns to ſhoot. Having pauſed awhile, he reſolves upon making gins, wherewith he had ſeen hares catched in Europe: thus, taking ſome of the cords which he found with the ſail at the outſide of the rock, he goes to work, and makes ſeveral, which he faſtens at divers gaps in the thickſet, within the wood, through which he judged that ſort of beaſt, he had a mind for, went.</p>
               <p>Impatient to know the ſucceſs of his ſnares, he gets up betimes the next morning, and goes to examine them; in one he found a certain animal ſomething like a fawn, the colour of a deer, but feet and ears like a fox, and as big as a well-grown hare. He was much rejoiced at his game, whoſe mouth he immediately opened, to ſee if he could find out whether it fed upon graſs, or lived upon prey: the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being caught by the neck, and ſtrangled with ſtruggling, before it died, had brought up in its throat ſome of the greens it had been eating, which very much pleaſed him; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting thoſe which lived upon fleſh as bad as carrion.</p>
               <p>Having returned thanks for his good luck, he takes it home in order to dreſs part of it for his dinner; ſo caſes and guts it: but it proving to be a female, big with three young ones, grieved him to the heart, and made him repent making thoſe killing nooſes. <q>What pity, ſaid he, ſo many lives ſhould be loſt, and creatures waſted! One would have ſerved me four days; and here are four killed at once. Well, henceforth, to prevent the like evil, I will take alive what I juſt want and
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:030190_0140_0FE506036E059208"/>
ſave all the females.</q> So, having ſtuck a long ſtick at both ends in the ground, making a half circle, he hangs one quarter of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal upon a ſtring before a good fire, and ſo roaſts it.</p>
               <p>His dinner being ready, having ſaid grace, he ſet to eating with an uncommon appetite; and, whether it was the novelty of the diſh, or that the meat did juſtly deſerve the praiſe, he really thought he never eat any thing of fleſh, till then, comparable to it, either for taſte or tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>Having dined both plentifully and deliciouſly, he moſt zealouſly returns kind Providence thanks for the late, and all favours received; then purſuant to his reſolution, he goes to making nets, in order to take his game alive for the future; and, as he had no ſmall twine to make it with, he was obliged to unravel ſome of the ſail which he luckily had by him; and with the thread, twiſted ſome of the bigneſs he judged proper for that uſe.</p>
               <p>Having made a ſufficient quantity, he makes a couple of nets, about four feet ſquare, which he faſtens in the room of the killing ſnares; ſo retired, and reſolved to come and examine them every morning.</p>
               <p>Several days paſſed without taking any thing, ſo that he wanted fleſh for a whole week, which did begin to diſorder his ſtomach, but not his temper; being entirely reſigned to the will of Providence, and fully contented with whatever Heaven was pleaſed to ſend.</p>
               <p>One afternoon, which was not his cuſtomary time of day to examine his nets, being too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:030190_0141_0FE5060540DA2B90"/>
in the day-time for game to run in; he happened to walk in the wood, to take the full dimenſions thereof, ſo chanced to go by his nets; in one of which were taken two animals, as big as a kid ſix weeks old, of a bright dun, their horns upright and ſtraight, their ſhape like a ſtag, moſt curiouſly limbed, a ſmall tuft of hair on each ſhoulder and hip. By their horns, which were but ſhort, they appeared to be very young, which rejoiced him the more, being in hopes to tame thoſe which he did not want for preſent uſe; ſo carried them home joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his game, depending upon a good din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but was ſadly diſappointed: the animals he found were antelopes (calling to mind he had ſeen them in his travels,) which proving both females, he had made a reſolution to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. Though they were too young to be with kid, and he in great need of fleſh, yet he would not kill them; ſo with cords faſtens them to the outſide of his lodge; and with conſtant feeding them, in two months time made them ſo tame, that they followed him up and down; which added much to the pleaſure he already, took in his habitation, which by that time was covered with green leaves, both top and ſides; the stakes it was made of having ſtruck root, and ſhot out young branches, whoſe ſtrength increaſing that ſummer; to fill up the vacancy between each plant, he pulled the turfs, wherewith he had covered the outſide and top of the hut between them, to keep the cold out in the winter.</p>
               <p>His former hut, being now become a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant arbour, gave him encouragement to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:030190_0142_0FE50606E2E62888"/>
ſome pains about it towards the embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, which ſeemed to depend on being well attended. He reſolved upon keeping it pruned and watered, the better to make it grow thick and faſt, which anſwered his intent; for in three years time, the ſtems of every plant that compoſed the arbour, were grown quite cloſe, and made a ſolid wall of about ſix inches thick, covered with green leaves without, which lay moſt regular and even, and within had a moſt agreeable ſmooth bark, of a pleaſant olive colour.</p>
               <p>His late arbour being, by his care and time, and nature's aſſiſtance, become a matchleſs lodge, as intended by nature for ſomething more than human gueſts, he now conſults to make it as commodious as beautiful. <q>Here is, ſaid he, a delightful dwelling, warm in the winter, and cool in the ſummer; delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the eye, and comfortable to the body; pity it ſhould be employed to any uſe, but repoſe and delight!</q> So reſolved upon mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a kitchen near it. Thus having fixed upon a place convenient at the ſide of his lodge, about ſix feet from it, twelve in length, and eight in breadth, which he incloſed with the turfs that covered the outſide of his arbour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was ſufficiently thick to keep out the cold; then having laid ſticks acroſs the top of the walls, which were about eight feet high, he lays turf thereon, and ſo covers it, leaving an open place for the ſmoke to go out.</p>
               <p>The outſide being done, he goes about in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide neceſſaries, as fire-places to roaſt and boil at; thus cuts a hole in the ground, at a ſmall
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:030190_0143_0FE5060F3A776C28"/>
diſtance from the wall, after the manner of ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoves in noblemen's kitchens; then, at another place, he ſets two flat ſtones, about eight or nine inches broad, and one foot long, edge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, oppoſite to one another, near two feet aſunder; then puts a third in the ſame manner, at the end of the other two; ſo makes a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place fit to roaſt at: then, for other conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, he weaves twigs about ſticks, ſtuck in the wall on one ſide of the kitchen, where he lays the ſhells fit for utenſils, which both adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and furniſhed it.</p>
               <p>Having completed that piece of work, he goes and viſits his plantations, which he finds in a thriving condition; the roots being, in ſix months time, grown from the bigneſs of a pea (as they were when firſt ſet) to that of an egg: his antelopes were alſo come to their full growth and complete beauty, which exceeded moſt four footed beaſts, having a majeſtic pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, body and limbs repreſenting a ſtag, and the noble march of a horſe: ſo every thing concurred to his happineſs. For which having returned his moſt liberal benefactor his grateful acknowledgements, he thinks on means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any obſtructions that may intercept the continuation thereof; and as the want of cloaths was the only cauſe he could think of to make him uneaſy, having but the jacket and hoſe which were given him on board, to ſave his own cloaths, which when worn out he could not recruit; therefore, to accuſtom himſelf to go without, he leſſens thoſe he had, and takes away the lining from the outſide, in order to wear the thickeſt in the coldeſt weather, and
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:030190_0144_0FE50617DF0F2818"/>
ſo thins his dreſs by degrees, till at laſt he went quite naked.</p>
               <p>Having thus concluded, as being the beſt ſhift neceſſity could raiſe him, he falls to rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his jacket, in the lining whereof he finds ſeven peas and three beans, which were got in at a hole at the corner of the pocket.</p>
               <p>Thoſe few made him wiſh for more, which he had no room to hope for, they being raiſed by ſeed, which the iſland did not produce: <q>Theſe few, ſaid he, which at preſent are hardly ſufficient to ſatisfy a woman's longing, may, with time and induſtry, be improved to a quantity large enough to ſerve me for a meal;</q> then lays them up againſt a proper time to ſet them; ſo ſpent the remainder of that ſummer in walking about the iſland, watering his lodge, weeding his root plantation, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his nets, which now and then ſupplied him with an antelope or goat, to eat at intervals between fiſh he commonly found on the rock after high winds and ſtorms; never failing to viſit the ſea three or four times a week, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the weather did prove; thus divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many anxious hours with the variety of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that element affords. Sometimes he had the pleaſure of ſeeing great whales chaſing one another, ſpouting large ſtreams of water out of their gills and noſtrils; at other times, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of beautiful dolphins rolling amongſt the waves; now and then a quantity of ſtrange monſtrous fiſh playing on the ſurface of the ſea, ſome whereof had heads (not common to fiſhes) like thoſe of hogs; others not unlike thoſe of dogs, calves, horſes, lions, bulls,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:030190_0145_0FE5061993E33790"/>
goats, and ſeveral other creatures: ſome chaſing another ſort; which, to avoid being taken, would quit their element, and ſeek refuge in the air, and fly ſome yards above the water; till their fins being dry, obliged them to plunge in again.</p>
               <p>Theſe paſtimes being generally ſucceeded with bad weather, and dreadful ſtorms, checked the pleaſure they gave, with a dread of the evil that threatened to follow. Thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerating the caſe of thoſe whoſe misfortune is to be expoſed to them; having ſpent ſome time in reflexion, he goes to his uſual devotion, and calling to mind, that in all that time he never ſaw a young fiſh in the pond, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured that ſomething might deſtroy the ſmall ones; and as he imagined ſo it proved: for at his approach, a large fowl flew out of the pond with a fiſh in its bill, being too large for it to ſwallow.</p>
               <p>At that diſtance, the bird being alſo upon the wing, he could neither diſcern colour nor make; but he had the ſatisfaction of diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe why the fiſhes did not increaſe, they being devoured when young by that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which to prevent for the future, he ſtudies means to kill the deſtroyer; nets not being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inſtruments, it being requiſite, for that purpoſe, to have one all round, as alſo to cover the pond, which was impoſſible by reaſon of its largeneſs; and a leſs being of no uſe, the birds probably not coming to one certain place. He wiſhed for a gun and ammunition fitting, as being the moſt probable things to ſucceed; but no ſuch inſtrument being within his reach,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:030190_0146_0FE5061B1E721140"/>
he ponders again; during which time, a croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow offers itſelf to his mind, but is as diſtant from his reach as the gun. It is true, there was ſtuff enough in the iſland to make many, but no tools except a hatchet and pocket knife, wherewith, if he made ſhift to cut and ſhape a bow, he could not make a latch and ſpring ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to it; ſo he muſt not think on it: yet a bow being the only thing he could apply to, he goes about one forthwith. Thus having picked a branch of a tree, which had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of yew, and as tough, of which they are ſometimes made, he, with the tools he had, made a ſhift to make one about ſix feet long, and arrows of the ſame, which he hardens and ſtraightens over the fire; then having ſlit them at one end, about two or three inches, he ſlips in a bit of parchment, cut ſharp at one end, and about three inches at the other, then ties the end cloſe, to keep it in, which ſerved for
<figure/>
                  <pb n="142" facs="unknown:030190_0147_0FE506248CF9F5E0"/>
feathers; and, with the ravelling of ſome of the ſail, he makes a ſtring to it.</p>
               <p>Thus equipped for an archer, wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſkill, which is only to be gained by practice, he daily exerciſes ſhooting at a mark for the ſpace of a fortnight; in which time he made ſuch an improvement, that at three ſhots he would hit a mark of about three inches ſquare, at near fifty paces diſtance.</p>
               <p>Being ſufficiently ſkilled, he goes and lies in wait for his deſired game; ſo placed himſelf behind a tree, as near the pond as he could, whither the bird came in a few hours after.</p>
               <p>The creature being pitched upon the bank, never ſtood ſtill, but kept running round, watching for a ſizeable fiſh fit to ſwallow; ſo that he had no opportunity to ſhoot; till having at laſt, eſpied out one, it launched itſelf into the pond, but roſe more ſlowly, which gave him time to take aim; nevertheleſs, he miſſed it, being in motion; but when come to the top, he ſtruck it through the body as it opened its wings, and laid it flat on the other ſide of the pond. He took it up, wonderfully pleaſed at his good ſucceſs the firſt time of his practiſing his new acquired art; yet, having taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the bird's beauty, he had a regret for its death, though he might, in time, have rued its living; the ſtock of fiſh weekly decreaſing, by his own catching one now and then with a ſmall net he made for that uſe, when ſhort of other proviſions, and their recruiting prevented by that bird's daily devouring their young.</p>
               <p>The inexpreſſible beauty of the feathers, which were after the nature of a drake, every
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:030190_0148_0FE5062755B40BA8"/>
one diſtinguiſhed from another by a rim round the edge thereof, about the breadth of a large thread, and of a changeable colour from red to aurora and green; the ribs of a delightful blue, and the feathers pearl colour, ſpeckled with a bright yellow; the breaſt and belly (if it might be ſaid to be of any particular colour) was that of a dove's feather rimmed like the back, diverſly changing; the head, which was like that of a ſwan for make, was purple alſo, changing as it moved; the bill like burniſhed gold; eyes like a ruby, with a rim of gold round it; the feet the ſame as the bill; the ſize of the bird was between a middling gooſe and a duck, and in ſhape reſembling a ſwan.</p>
               <p>Having bemoaned the death of that delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful creature, he carefully takes out its fleſh, which, corrupting, would ſpoil the outſide; then fills the ſkin with ſweet herbs, which he dried for that uſe; and having ſewed up the place he had cut open to take the fleſh out, he ſet it up in his lodge.</p>
               <p>His good ſucceſs in archery made him love the exerciſe; ſo that what odd hours he had in the day (beſides thoſe he ſet apart for his divine worſhip, and thoſe neceſſary occupations about his lodge, plantations, and making remarks) he beſtowed in ſhooting at the mark, which in time made him ſo expert, that he hardly would miſs a ſtanding mark the bigneſs of a dove, at forty or fifty yards diſtance, once in ten times; and would ſhoot tolerably well flying, having once occaſion to try it upon a monſtrous eagle, which often flew round over the place where his antelopes and goats fed, near his lodge,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:030190_0149_0FE50628E0F37C60"/>
which he ſhot at, fearing it would damage them, and killed it with the ſecond arrow.</p>
               <p>The ſummer being over, during which, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been much taken up about his habitation and plantations, he had neither time nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to make remarks, farther than it was ſome days very ſhowery, and for the moſt part generally very hot; but now the weather being grown ſomething cold, and the wind pretty ſharp, he muſt be obliged to put on ſome cloaths to keep it off, being as yet too tender to go any longer without; next to provide for his ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopes againſt the approaching winter; ſo makes a lodge for them, at the backſide of his kitchen, with ſticks, which he drove into the ground, about two feet from the wall, and then bends them about three feet from the ground, and ſlicks them in the ſaid wall, and ſmaller bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches he interwove between them: he ſhuts up the front, and covers the top, leaving both ends open for the antelopes to go in at; then lays graſs (which he dried on purpoſe) in the ſaid lodge, for them to lie on. Thus, having dug up a conſiderable quantity of roots, and being already ſtocked with ſalt-fiſh, both dry and in pickle, he was pretty well provided for his cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and himſelf, againſt the enſuing winter, which proved much like the preceding one, only not ſo ſtormy.</p>
               <p>The ſucceeding ſpring having awaked ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering nature, and revived what the preceding hard ſeaſon had cauſed to droop, every vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table puts on new cloathing and recovers its wonted beauty; each animal aſſumes freſh vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour; the beaſts in the wood leap and bound
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:030190_0150_0FE5062A6BCFCE18"/>
for joy, and each bird on the trees ſings for gladneſs. The whole creation is, as it were, repaired, and every creature decked with new life. Love by Nature's direction, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of every kind, warms their harmleſs breaſts; each animal ſeeks a mate; our tame antelopes quit their abode, and range the woods for the relief ordained to quell their innocent paſſion; which being aſſuaged, they return home, pregnant with young, to their maſter's great ſatisfaction; who, having given them over, was doubly rejoiced to ſee them come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in an increaſing condition. <q>Heaven be praiſed! ſaid he, I ſhall have a ſtock of my own, and will not fear wanting.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So, having made fitting preparations againſt their kidding, he goes and examines the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his new plantation, where he found his roots grown full as large as any of thoſe that grew wild. <q>Make me thankful! ſaid he, I am new provided with all neceſſary food. I ſhall no more need to rob thoſe poor creatures of that which Nature had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for their own proper uſe.</q> Next he goes and views his ſmall ſtock of peas and beans, which he found in a very promiſing caſe. So, whilſt the weather was fair, he falls to clearing a ſpot of ground to ſet them in, as they increaſed.</p>
               <p>Turning up the ground he found ſeveral ſorts of roots that looked to be eatable, ſome whereof were as big as a large carrot, others leſs. He broke a bit of every one, ſome of which breaking ſhort, and being not ſtringy, he judged they muſt be eatable; then he ſmells
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:030190_0151_0FE5063585923560"/>
them, and finding the ſcent not diſagreeable, he taſtes them. Some were ſweetiſh, others ſharp and hot, like horſe-radiſh; and thoſe he propoſes to uſe inſtead of ſpice. <q>Sure, ſaid he, theſe being of a pleaſant ſcent and favour, cannot be offenſive to nature.</q> So having manured his ground, he takes a ſample of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery root which he judged eatable, and boils them, as the ſureſt way to experience their goodneſs.</p>
               <p>Moſt of them proved not only paſſable good, but extraordinary; ſome eating like parſnips, others almoſt like carrots, but rather more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable; ſome like beets and turnips; every one in their ſeveral kinds, as good as ever he eat in England, but of different colours and make; ſome being bluiſh, others black, ſome red, and others yellow. Theſe though not wanted, having ſufficient to gratify a nicer taſte than his, were, nevertheleſs, extremely wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, being ſomewhat like his native country fare and product. So having returned thanks for this moſt agreeable addition to his ordinary, he ſets a mark to every herb which thoſe roots bore, in order to get ſome of the ſeed to ſow in the ground he would prepare: ſo, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with fleſh, fiſh, herbs, and ſeveral ſorts of roots, he goes and examines what improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his peas and beans have made, which he found increaſed to admiration; the ſeven peas having produced one thouſand, and the three beans one hundred: having returned thanks for that vaſt increaſe, he lays them by, in order to ſet them at a proper ſeaſon, as he had done the year before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="unknown:030190_0152_0FE50637106C73D8"/>
By this time his antelopes had kidded, one of them having brought three young ones, and the ſecond two. This vaſt addition to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions very much rejoiced him, being ſure now not to want fleſh at his need, which before he was in danger of, finding but ſeldom any thing in his net: ſo makes account to live upon two of the young bucks whilſt they laſted, killing one as ſoon as fit for meat, and ſo now and then another, ſaving only five to breed; one whereof ſhould be a mate to keep the females from the wood; leſt at one time or other they ſhould ſtay away for good and all.</p>
               <p>The old ones being well fed, as he always took care to do, providing for them ſtore of thoſe greens he knew they loved; as alſo boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed roots for them now and then, of which they are very fond; the young ones throve apace, and grew very fat: ſo that in three weeks time they were large and fit to eat. He killed one; which being roaſted, proved to be more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious that any houſe-lamb, ſucking pig, young fawn, or any other ſuckling whatever.</p>
               <p>Having lived upon that, with now and then a little fiſh, about one month, which was as long as he could keep it eatable, having dreſſed it at two different times, five days interval; eating the cold remains in ſeveral manners; reſerving one of the other two males for a time he ſhould be ſcanted, and in want of fleſh; but was unluckily diſappointed by a parcel of large eagles, which flying one morning over the place where the young antelopes were play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being of a gay, as well as active diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, launched themſelves with precipitation
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:030190_0153_0FE50638A25A3080"/>
upon the male he reſerved for time of need, and one of the females which he kept for breed; ſeeing his beloved diverters carrying away by thoſe birds of prey, he runs in for his bow, but came too late with it, the eagles being gone.</p>
               <p>Having loſt his two dear antelopes, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the female, having doomed the male for his own eating, he hardly could forbear weeping to think of their being cruelly torn to pieces by thoſe ravenous creatures: thus having for ſome time lamented the loſs, and bewailed their hard fate, he thinks on means to prevent the like evil for the time to come; and as his bow was not always at hand, he reſolves upon making a net, and faſtens it between the trees he ſaw them come in at.</p>
               <p>The ſucceeding winter proving very wet and windy, gave him but little invitation to take his uſual walks; ſo having every thing he had occaſion for at hand, he kept cloſe to his net-making; for which having twine to twiſt, and thread to ravel out to make the ſaid twine, kept him employed till the following ſpring, which came on apace.</p>
               <p>Having finiſhed his net, and every thing which belonged to it, he goes and faſtens it to the trees, as he had propoſed; then takes a walk to his new plantations, which he found in a thriving condition; for which, and other bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits already received, he reſolves, as in duty bound, to attend at his uſual place of worſhip, and ſing thankſgiving pſalms, which the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the weather had kept him from all the late winter; but it now coming into his mind, that whilſt he was at his devotion, returning
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:030190_0154_0FE5063B938F6E58"/>
thanks for the fair proſpect of a plentiful crop, his antelopes would break into the cloſe, the hedge being as yet but thin, and devour the promiſing buds, which are the principal occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his devotion; this not altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper conſideration puts a ſad check to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious intention: and though there was a vaſt obligation to prompt him to the performance of that part of his duty, yet he could not, with wiſdom, run the hazard, out of mere devotion, to loſe ſo promiſing a crop, which he ſhould never be able to retrieve; all his ſtock of ſeed being then in graſs.</p>
               <p>As he was debating in his mind between re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and reaſon, whether the latter ought not to be a director to the former, he perceived his antelopes making towards the peas, to which they, doubtleſs, would have got in, had he not returned, and driven them another way: which accident convinced him he might find a more proper time to go about his devotion; no man being required to worſhip to his prejudice: ſo, having put off his religious duty till he had better ſecured his peas and beans, he cuts a parcel of branches, wherewith he ſtops thoſe gaps to prevent the creatures going in; and having completed his work, he goes to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, adding to his uſual thankſgiving a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular collect for his luckily being in the way to prevent his being fruſtrated of the bleſſing Heaven ſo fairly promiſed to beſtow on his labours.</p>
               <p>Having paid his devotion, he walks about the iſland, being all the way delighted with the birds celebrating their Maker's praiſe, in their
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:030190_0155_0FE50640C3977EA0"/>
different harmonious notes! <q>Every thing in nature, ſaid he, anſwers the end of its creation, but ungrateful man! who, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to be wiſe as his Creator, only learns to make himſelf wretched.</q> Thus he walks till evening, making ſeveral reflexions on the different conditions of men, preferring his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate to that of Adam before his fall, who could not be ſenſible of happineſs, having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known a reverſe; which, otherwiſe, he would have been more careful to prevent. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come home, and near bed-time, he firſt ate his ſupper, and then, having performed his cuſtomary religious ſervice, he goes to bed. The next morning, after paying his uſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, he takes a walk to his plantations, on which he implores a continuation of the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous condition they appear to be in; next, he goes to examine his nets, in which he finds a brace of fowls like ducks, but twice as large, and exceeding beautiful: the drake (which he knew by a coloured feather on his rump) was of a fine cinnamon colour upon his back, his breaſt of a mazarine blue, the belly of a deep orange, his neck green, head purple, his eyes, bill, and feet, red; every colour changing moſt agreeably as they moved. The duck was alſo very beautiful, but of quite different colours, and much paler than the drake's.</p>
               <p>The diſappointment in catching thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful fowls, inſtead of ravenous eagles, as he had purpoſed, no ways diſpleaſed him, but he rather was rejoiced to have ſuch beautiful fowls to look at; yet it went much againſt his mind to deprive thoſe creatures of their liberty (the
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:030190_0156_0FE506456499CFE0"/>
greateſt comfort in life) which nature took ſuch pains to adorn: <q>But, ſaid he, they were created for the uſe of man: ſo, in keeping them for my pleaſure, they will but anſwer the end of their creation. Their confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be no ſtricter than my own; they ſhall have the whole iſland to range in.</q> He then pinions them, puts them in the pond, and makes baſkets for them to ſhelter in, which he places in the branches of thoſe trees that hung cloſeſt to the water, taking particular care to feed them daily with roots roaſted and boiled, and the guts of the fiſh, and other creatures, he uſed for his own eating; which made them thrive mainly, and take to the place; ſo that they bred in their ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>The five antelopes had by this time kidded, and brought ten young ones: his peas and beans alſo were wonderfully improved, having that ſeaſon enough to ſtock the ground the year following. Thus he returned kind Providence thanks for the vaſt increaſe, and concludes to live upon the young antelopes as long as they laſted, reſerving only one for ſuck of the old ones, to keep them in milk, of which he had taken notice they had plenty, deſigning to draw it daily for his own uſe; ſo that in a little time, he had enough to ſkim for cream, which he uſed for ſauce inſtead of butter, and made ſmall cheeſes of the reſt. Now having a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtore of dairy ware, he reſolves to make a place to keep it in; the kitchen wherein he was obliged to lay his ſalt fiſh (which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſmells ſtrong,) not being a proper place for cream and milk: for which end he makes a
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:030190_0157_0FE50648833B2218"/>
dairy-houſe at the other ſide of his dwelling, with branches of trees, after the manner of a cloſe arbour, and thatches it over with graſs; which anſwering the kitchen in form and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made uniform wings, that added as much to the beauty as conveniency of the habitation.</p>
               <p>Having completed his dairy, he proceeds in his reſolution of making cheeſe, having learned the way in Holland; and for want of rennet to turn his milk, he takes ſome of the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſh ſeed, which being of a hot nature, had the ſame effect: having curd to his mind, he ſeaſons it to his palate; then with his hatchet, he cuts a notch round in the bark of a tree, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eighteen inches in circumference; and a ſecond in the ſame manner, ſix inches below that; then ſlits the circle, and with his knife gently opens it, parting it from the tree: thus he makes as many hoops as he judged would contain his paſte, which being girded round with cords to keep them from opening, he fills with the ſaid paſte, and lays them by, till fit to eat.</p>
               <p>This being done, which completed his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, he returns thanks for thoſe bleſſings which had been ſo liberally beſtowed on him: <q>Now, ſaid he, Heaven be praiſed! I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a prince in happineſs: I have a habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtrong and laſting, a beautiful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient freehold, ſtore of comforts, with all neceſſaries of life free coſt, which I enjoy with peace and pleaſure uncontrouled: yet I think there is ſtill ſomething wanting to complete my happineſs: if a partner in grief leſſen ſorrow, certainly it muſt in delight,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:030190_0158_0FE5064A0B2086A8"/>
augment pleaſure. What objects of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration are here concealed, and like a miſer's treaſure, hid from the world! If man, who was created for bliſs, could have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely happy alone, he would not have had a companion given him:</q> thus he walks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoughtful till bed-time.</p>
               <p>In that diſpoſition he goes to bed, and ſoon fell aſleep: the night alſo, being windy, added to his diſpoſition; but his mind finds no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: it ſtill run heavy upon the ſubject that took it up the day before, and forms ideas ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his inclination; and as ſolitude was the motive of its being diſturbed, he indulges it with the thoughts of company, dreaming that the ſame of his ſtation, and happy ſtate of life, was ſpread about the world; that it prompted a vaſt number of people, from all parts, to come to it, which at laſt induced ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral princes to claim a right to it; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing decided by a bloody war, a governor was ſent, who laid taxes, demanded duties, raiſed rents, and warns him to be gone, having fixed upon his habitation for himſelf to dwell in. Being ſadly diſturbed, he cries out in his ſleep, <q>This is a great puniſhment for my uneaſineſs: could I not be contented with being lord of this iſland, without provoking Heaven to bring me under the power of extorting go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors?</q>
               </p>
               <p>There happening a great noiſe, he ſtarts out of his ſleep, with the thoughts of hearing a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation; and cries out, <q>Alas! it is too late to proclaim an evil which is already come:</q> but being thoroughly awake, and
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:030190_0159_0FE50654E592FCF0"/>
the noiſe ſtill continuing, he found he had been dreaming, which very much rejoiced him, he therefore put on his cloaths, and haſtens to the place he heard the noiſe come from.</p>
               <p>Being within forty or fifty yards thereof, he ſaw a number of monkeys of two different kinds; one ſort ſquealing and fighting againſt the other without intermixing. At his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the battle ceaſed; and the combatants, retiring at ſome diſtance, left the ſpot of ground, on which they fought clear; whereon lay a conſiderable quantity of wild pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, which the wind had ſhook off the trees the night before, and which were the occaſion of their ſtrife.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>His coming having cauſed a truce, every one of thoſe creatures keeping ſtill and quiet during his ſtay, he reſolves to uſe his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make a ſolid peace; and as that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:030190_0160_0FE506566F651650"/>
had ariſen from the fruit there preſent, to which he could ſee no reaſon but that each kind had an equal right, he divides it into two equal parcels, which he lays oppoſite to each other towards both the parties, retiring a little way, to ſee whether this expedient would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the quarrel: which anſwered his intent; thoſe animals quietly coming to that ſhare next to them and peaceably carrying it away, each to their quarters. This occaſioned ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions on the frivolous, and often unjuſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels that ariſe among princes, which create ſuch bloody wars, as prove the deſtruction of vaſt numbers of their ſubjects. <q>If monarchs ſaid he, always acted with as much reaſon as theſe creatures, how much blood and money would they ſave!</q> Thus he goes on to his uſual place of worſhip, in order to return thanks, that he was free of that evil, the dream where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of had ſo tortured his mind; though he confeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he juſtly deſerved the reality, for his uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the happieſt of circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Having paid his devotion, he takes a walk to ſee how his peas and beans came on, which he found in a very improving diſpoſition, each ſtem bearing a vaſt number of well filled pods. <q>Heaven be praiſed! ſaid he, I ſhall eat of this year's crop, and have ſufficient to ſtock my ground the enſuing one.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus being plentifully ſupplied with neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and in a pleaſant iſland, every thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him being come to perfection; his dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which ſeems intended by nature for ſome immortal gueſt, being, by time, yearly repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and improved, leaving no room for care;
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:030190_0161_0FE50657F6D88700"/>
yet the unwiſe man, as if an enemy to his eaſe, cannot be contented with the enjoyment of more than he could reaſonably crave, but muſt diſturb his mind with what concerns him not: <q>What pity, ſaid he, ſo delightful a habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, attended with ſuch conveniences, and ſituated in ſo wholeſome an air, and fruitful a land, ſhould at my death loſe all thoſe wonderful properties, being become uſeleſs for want of ſomebody to enjoy them! What admiration will here be loſt for want of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders? But what kind man could I ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle it upon, worthy of ſo fine an inheritance? Were it my pleaſure to chooſe myſelf an heir, ſuch only appear virtuous, whoſe weak na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture confides to chaſtity: every conſtitution cannot bear exceſs: want of courage occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions mildneſs, and lack of ſtrength good temper: thus virtue is made a cloak to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity. But why do I thus willingly ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per myſelf with thoſe cares Providence has been pleaſed to free me of?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he holds the iſland from Providence: freely he bequeaths it to whom Providence ſhall think fit to beſtow it upon: and that his heir may the better know the worth of the gift, he draws a map of the whole eſtate; and made an inventory of every individual tenement, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances, meſſuages, goods, and chattels, and alſo a draft of the terms and conditions he is to hold the here-mentioned poſſeſſion upon; <abbr>viz.</abbr>

by nature, ſtored with choice and delicious roots and plants for food, bearing peas and beans; likewiſe a noble fiſh-pond, well ſtocked with divers ſorts of curious fiſh; and a ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wood, harbouring ſeveral ſorts of wild fowl, and beaſts, ſit for a nabob's table.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> A dwelling commenced by art, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by nature, and completed by time, which yearly keeps it in repair; and alſo its furniture.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>That whoſoever ſhall be by Providence ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in this bleſſed abode, ſhall, morning and evening, conſtantly (unleſs prevented by ill weather or accident) attend at the eaſt ſide of this iſland, and within the alcove nature prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the lodgment of ſeveral harmonious echoes, and there pay his devotion; ſinging thankſgiving pſalms to the great Origin and Director of all things, whoſe praiſes he will have the comfort to hear repeated by melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous voices.</p>
               <p>Next, he ſhall religiouſly obſerve and keep a ſeventh day for worſhip only, from the riſing of the ſun until the going down thereof: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhall, the day before, make all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary proviſion for that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="unknown:030190_0163_0FE50661988CE1B0"/>
That he ſhall, after any tempeſtuous wind or ſtorm, viſit the ſea at the outſide of the rock, at the eaſt, ſouth, weſt, and north ends, in order to aſſiſt any one in diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>He ſhall not be waſteful of any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, eſpecially of any creature's life; killing no more than what is neceſſary for his health: but ſhall every day examine his nets, ſetting at liberty the overplus of his neceſſity, leſt they ſhould periſh in their confinement.</p>
               <p>He muſt alſo keep every thing in the ſame order and cleanneſs he ſhall find them in; till and manure the ground yearly; ſet and ſow plants and ſeeds, fit for food, in their proper ſeaſons.</p>
               <p>Having written this at the bottom of the map he had drawn, being ſupper time, he takes his meal; then goes to his uſual evening de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; and, after an hour's walk, to his bed, ſleeping quietly all night, as being eaſy in his mind.</p>
               <p>The next morning he takes his uſual walks, and viſits his nets. In that he had ſet for eagles, he found a fowl as big as a turkey, but the colour of a pheaſant, only a tail like a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge; this having no ſign of being a bird of prey, he was loth to kill it; but having had no freſh meat for above a week, he yields to his appetite, and dreſſes it, eating part thereof for his dinner: it was very fat and plump, and eat much like a pheaſant, but rather tenderer, and fuller of gravy.</p>
               <p>Though he was very well pleaſed with the bird he had taken, yet he had rather it had been one of the eagles which kept his young ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopes
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:030190_0164_0FE5066B2A618878"/>
in jeopardy: but as he could not deſtroy them with his net, which he had hung a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time without the intended ſucceſs, he projects the prevention of their increaſe, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying their eggs, leaving his nets wholly for the uſe they had been ſucceſsful in; and ſearches the clifts of the rock next the ſea, where thoſe birds commonly build; where having found ſeveral neſts, he takes away the eggs that were in them, being then their breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, and carries them home, in order to empty the ſhells, and hang them up and down in his habitation, amongſt the green leaves which covered the cieling thereof; but having accidentally broke one, and the yolk and white thereof being like that of a turkey, he had the curioſity to boil one and taſte it, which eat much after the manner of a ſwan's. The reſt he ſaved to eat now and then for a change, reaping a double advantage by robbing thoſe birds; leſſening thereby the damage they might do him in time, and adding a diſh to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fare.</p>
               <p>In this proſperous way he lived fifteen years, finding no alteration in the weather or ſeaſons, nor meeting in all the time with any tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons worthy of record: ſtill performing his uſual exerciſes, and taking his walks with all the content and ſatisfaction his happy condition could procure; entirely forſaking all thoughts and deſires of ever quitting the bleſſed ſtation he then had in his poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>Thus having walked the iſland over and over (which though delightful, yet the frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the wonders it produces, renders
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:030190_0165_0FE5066CF80F0F18"/>
them, as it were, common, and leſs admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble), he proceeds to view the ſea, whoſe fluid element being ever in motion, daily affords new objects of admiration.</p>
               <p>The day being fair, and the weather as calm, he ſat down upon the rock, taking pleaſure in ſeeing the waves roll, and, as it were, chaſe one another; the next purſuing the firſt, on which it rides, when come at; and being itſelf overtaken by a ſucceeding, is alſo mounted on thus, wave upon wave, till a bulky body is compoſed, too heavy for the undermoſt to bear, and then ſinks all together: this, ſaid he, is a true emblem of ambition; men ſtriving to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do one another are often undone.</p>
               <p>As he was making reflexions on the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of vanity and pride, returning Heaven thanks, that he was ſeparated from the world, which abounds in nothing elſe; a ſhip appears at a great diſtance, a ſight he had not ſeen ſince his ſhipwreck: <q>Unlucky invention; ſaid he, that thou ſhouldſt ever come into men's thoughts! the ark, which gave the firſt notion of a floating habitation, was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered for the preſervation of man; but its fatal copies daily expoſe him to deſtruction.</q> Having therefore returned Heaven thanks for his being out of thoſe dangers, he makes a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn vow, never to return into them again, though it were to gain the world: but his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution proved as brittle as his nature was frail. The men on board had ſpied him out with their perſpective glaſſes; and ſuppoſing him to be ſhipwrecked, and to want relief, ſent their long-boat with two men to fetch him away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="unknown:030190_0166_0FE5066E8630CEF0"/>
At their approach his heart alters its motion; his blood ſtops from its common courſe; his ſinews are all relaxed, which intirely unframes his reaſon, and makes him a ſtranger to his own inclination; which ſtruggling with his waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolution, occaſions a debate between hope and fear; but the boat being come pretty nigh, gave hope the advantage, and his late reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion yields to his revived inclination, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now encouraged by a probable opportunity of being anſwered, ruſhes on to execution. He now, quitting all his former reliance on Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, depends altogether upon his getting away, bleſſing the lucky opportunity of ſeeing his bleſſed country again, for which pleaſure he freely quits and forſakes all the happineſs he enjoyed; gladly abandoning his delightful ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, and plentiful iſland. He thinks no more of Providence; his mind is intirely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with his voyage; but diſappointment, which often attends the greateſt probabilities, ſnatches ſucceſs out of his hand before he could graſp it, and intercepts his ſuppoſed infallible retreat; the boat could not approach him, by reaſon of the rocks running a great way into the ſea under water; nor could he come at the boat for ſharp points, and deep holes, which made it unfordable, as well as unnavigable; ſo that after ſeveral hours ſtriving in vain on both ſides to come at one another; the men, after they had ſtriven all they could but to no purpoſe, ſaid ſomething to him in a rage, which he underſtood not, and went without him, more wretched now, than when he was firſt caſt away. His full dependance on a retreat made
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:030190_0167_0FE5068021183E88"/>
him abandon all further reliance on Providence, whom then he could implore; but now, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ungratefully deſpiſed Heaven's bounties, which had been ſo largely beſtowed on him, he has forfeited all hopes of aſſiſtance from thence, and expects none from the world. Thus deſtitute, and in the greateſt perplexity, he cries out, <q>whither ſhall I now fly for help? The world can give me none, and I dare not crave any more from Heaven. O curſed deluſion! but rather curſed weakneſs! why did I give way to it? had I not enough of the world, or was I grown weary of being happy?</q> So, ſaying, he falls a weeping: <q>Could I ſhed a flood of tears, ſufficient to waſh away my fault or eaſe me of the remorſe it does create!</q>
               </p>
               <p>The pains and labour he had been at in the day, climbing up and down the rock, drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging himſelf to and fro, to come at the boat, having very much bruiſed his limbs; and the diſappointment of his full dependance on the late promiſing ſucceſs, as alſo the tormenting remorſe, and heavy grief, for his ſinful reliance thereon, much fatiguing his mind, rendered ſleep, which is ordained for the refreſhment of nature, of ſmall relief to him; his thoughts are continually diſturbed with frightful viſions; all his paſt dangers glare at him, as if threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening their return.</p>
               <p>Being now awaked from his diſagreeable ſleep, he makes a firm reſolution never to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to go from hence, whatever oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity offers, though attended with ever ſo great a probability of ſucceſs, and proſpect of gain; fully ſettling his whole mind and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:030190_0168_0FE50681E30F4FB0"/>
on the ſtate and condition Heaven has been pleaſed to place him in; reſolving to let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing enter into his thoughts, but his moſt grateful duty to ſo great a benefactor, who has ſo often and miraculouſly reſcued him from death.</p>
               <p>Thus having entirely baniſhed the world out of his mind, which before often diſturbed it, he limits his thoughts within the bounds of his bleſſed poſſeſſion, which affords him more than is ſufficient to make his life happy; where plenty flows on him, and pleaſure attends his deſires; abounding in all things that can gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify his appetite, or delight his fancy: a herd of delightful antelopes, bounding and playing about his habitation, divert him at home; and in his walks he is entertained with the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of divers kinds of ſinging-birds; every place he comes at offers him new objects for pleaſure: thus all ſeems to concur in complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his happineſs.</p>
               <p>In this moſt bleſſed ſtate he thinks himſelf as Adam before his fall, having no room for wiſhes, only that every thing may continue in its preſent condition; but it cannot be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that fair weather, which ſmiles on the earth's beauty, will not change. The ſun muſt go its courſe, and the ſeaſons take their turn; which conſiderations muſt, for the preſent, admit ſome ſmall care: he is naked, and his tender conſtitution ſuſceptible of the cold; therefore the cloaths he was caſt away in being worn out, he is obliged to think of providing ſomething to defend his limbs from the hardneſs of the approaching winter, whilſt it was yet warm.
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:030190_0169_0FE50683B3F45AA0"/>
Having conſidered what to make a wrapper of, he concludes upon uſing of the graſs he made mats of, on which he lay, being ſoft and warm, very fit for that purpoſe: of this he cuts down a ſufficient quantity, which, when ready to work, he makes ſmall twine with, and plaits it in narrow braids, which he ſews together with ſome of the ſame, and ſhapes a long looſe gown, that covered him to his heels, with a cap of the ſame.</p>
               <p>By that time he had finiſhed his winter-garb, the weather was grown cold enough for him to put it on. The froſty ſeaſon came on apace, in which there fell ſuch a quantity of ſnow, that he was forced to make a broom, and ſweep it away from about his habitation twice a day; as alſo the path he made to the places he had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to go to, toſſing the ſnow on each ſide, which before the winter was over, met at top, and covered it all the way; which obliged him to keep within doors for a conſiderable time, and melt ſnow inſtead of water; leſt, when going for ſome, he might chance to be buried amongſt the ſnow.</p>
               <p>The winter being over, and the ſnow diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the gay ſpring advances apace, offering nature its uſual aſſiſtance, repairing the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages the laſt froſt had done; which joyful tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings made every thing ſmile. Quarll, alſo, finding himſelf revived, took his former walks, which the preceding bad weather had kept him from, though there had been no conſiderable ſtorm the winter before.</p>
               <p>He having a mind to view the ſea, and being come to the outſide of the north-weſt end of
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:030190_0170_0FE5068540454E30"/>
the rock, ſees, at the foot thereof, ſomething like part of the body of a large hollow tree, the ends whereof were ſtopped with its own pitch; and the middle, which was ſlit open from end to end, gaping by a ſtick laid acroſs.</p>
               <p>This put him in mind of canoes, with which Indians paddle up and down their lakes and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; and being on that ſide the rock next to the iſland of California, he fancied ſome of them were come to viſit this iſland, though not many in number; their canoes holding at moſt but two men; for the generality, one only: yet, as ſome of theſe people are accounted great thieves, daily robbing one another, he haſtens home to ſecure what he had; but it was too late; they had been there already, and had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the cloaths he found in the cheſt; which being by far too little for him, hung careleſsly on a pin behind his door. Had they been contented with that, he would not have regarded it; but they carried away ſome of his curious ſhells, and, what grieved him moſt, the fine bird he had taken ſuch pains to dreſs and ſtuff, and care to preſerve; as alſo his bow and arrows.</p>
               <p>Having miſſed theſe things, which he much valued, he haſtens to the outſide of the rock, with his long ſtaff in his hand, in hopes to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them before they could get into their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe; but happened to go too late, they being already got half a league from the rock. Yet they did not carry away their theft: for there ariſing ſome wind, it made the ſea ſomewhat rough, and overſet their canoe; ſo that what was in it was all loſt, but the two Indians, who
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:030190_0171_0FE50689A38EDFF0"/>
moſt dexterouſly turned it on its bottom again, and with ſurpriſing activity leaped in it, one at the one ſide, and the other at the oppoſite; ſo that the canoe being trimmed at once, they paddled out of ſight.</p>
               <p>Having ſeen as much of them as he could, he walks to the north-eaſt ſide, in order to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the effect of the high wind, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the night before.</p>
               <p>Being come to the outſide of the rock, he perceives ſomething at a diſtance like a large cheſt, but having no lid on it; taking that to be the product of ſome late ſhipwreck, he grieved at the fatal accident; <q>How long, reflected he, will covetouſneſs decoy men to purſue wealth, at the coſt of their precious lives? Has not nature provided every nation and country a ſufficiency for its inhabitants? that they will rove on this moſt dangerous and boiſterous ſea, which may be titled Death's dominions, many periſhing therein, and not one on it being ſafe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As he was bewailing their fate who he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined had been caſt away, he ſees two men come down the rock, with each a bundle in his arm, who went to that which he had taken to be a cheſt; and, having put their load in it, puſhed it away till come to deep water; then, having got in it, with a long ſtaff, ſhoved it off, till they could row to a long boat that lay at ſome diſtance behind a jetting part of the rock, which ſcreened it from his ſight, as alſo the ſhip it belonged to.</p>
               <p>The ſight of this much amazed him, and made him ceaſe condoling others' ſuppoſed loſs,
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:030190_0172_0FE5069B1049EFE8"/>
to run home and examine his own; well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe bundles, he ſaw carried away, muſt needs belong to him, there being no other moveables in the iſland but what were in his lodge.</p>
               <p>Being come home, he finds indeed what he ſuſpected; thoſe villains had moſt ſacrilegiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rifled and ranſacked his habitation, not leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſo much as one of the mats to keep his poor body from the ground; his winter garb alſo is gone, and what elſe they could find for their uſe.</p>
               <p>The loſs of thoſe things, which he could not do without, filled him with ſorrow. <q>Now, ſaid he, I am in my firſt ſtate of being; nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I came into the world, and naked I ſhall go out of it;</q> at which he fell a weeping.</p>
               <p>Having grieved a while, <q>Why, ſaid he, ſhould I thus caſt myſelf down! Is not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, who gave me them, able to give me more?</q> Thus, having reſolved before win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to repleniſh his loſs, he reſts himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and gives the ruffians' evil action the beſt conſtruction he could. <q>Now I think on it, ſaid he, theſe ſurely are the men, who, about twelve months ſince, would charitably have carried me hence, but could not for want of neceſſary implements; and now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better provided, came to accompliſh their hoſpitable deſign; but not finding me, ſuppoſing I was either dead or gone, took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way what was here of no uſe; much good may what they have got do them, and may it be of as much uſe to them as it was to me.</q> Thus he walks out, in order to cut graſs to dry,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:030190_0173_0FE5069C98C61E08"/>
and make himſelf new bedding, and a winter garb.</p>
               <p>Having walked about half a mile, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the ſame men coming towards the pond. <q>Heaven be praiſed! ſaid he, here they be ſtill. Now when they ſee I am not gone, nor willing to go, they will return my things, which they are ſenſible I cannot do without,</q> with which words he goes up to them.</p>
               <p>By this time they had caught the two old ducks, which, being pinioned, could not fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as the reſt did. He was much vexed to ſee the beſt of his ſtock thus taken away, yet, as he thought they were come to do him ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he could grudge them nothing, that would any wiſe gratify them for ſo good an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. But having returned them thanks for their good will, he told them he was very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the iſland, and had made a vow never to go out of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe being Frenchmen, and of an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where politeneſs is of little uſe, being fiſhermen, and not underſtanding what he ſaid, only laughed in his face, and went on to the purpoſe they came about: then having as many of the ducks as they could get, they proceeded towards the houſe where they had ſeen the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telopes, ſome of which not running away at their approach, they propoſed to catch hold of them.</p>
               <p>Being come to the place where they uſed to feed, which was near the dwelling, the young ones, not being uſed to ſee any men in cloaths, nor any body but their maſter, preſently ſled; but the two old ones, which he had bred up,
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:030190_0174_0FE5069E22D10A48"/>
were ſo tame, that they ſtood ſtill, only when the men came to them, they kept cloſe to him, which gave the men opportunity to lay hold of them; when, notwithſtanding Quarll's repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed intreaties, they tied a halter about their horns, and barbarouſly led them away.</p>
               <p>Quarll was grieved to the heart to ſee his darlings, which he had taken ſuch care to breed up, and which were become the principal part of his delight, following him up and down, and which, by their jumping and playing before him often diſperſed melancholy thoughts; notwithſtanding all theſe endearing qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thus hauled away: he weeps, and on his knees begs they may be left; and though they underſtood not his words, his actions were ſo expreſſive and moving, that had they had the humanity of canibals, who eat one another, they would have yielded to ſo melting an object as the poor broken hearted Quarll was; but the inflexible boors went on, cruelly hauling and dragging the poor creatures, which, as if ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the barbarity of the act, looked back to their afflicted maſter, as craving his aſſiſtance; which, at laſt, ſo exaſperated him, that he was ſeveral times tempted to lay on the raviſhers with his long ſtaff; as often was ſtopt by the following conſideration: <q>Shall I, ſaid he, be the deſtruction of my fellow creatures, to reſcue out of their hands, animals of which I have an improving ſtore left, and deprive them of their healths, and perhaps of their lives, to recover what coſt me nought? Let them go with what they have, and the merit of their deed be their reward.</q> Thus he
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:030190_0175_0FE506A2C008E940"/>
walks about melancholy, bemoaning his poor antelopes' fate, and his own misfortune: <q>They were uſed to liberty, ſaid he, which they now are deprived of, and for which they will pine and die, which, for their ſake, I cannot but wiſh; for life without liberty is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual death.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As he was walking, thinking (as it is uſual after the loſs of anything one loves) of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he had during the enjoyment, the ruffians having ſecured the poor animals, came back with ropes in their hands. <q>What do they want next? ſaid he, have they not all they deſire; would they carry away my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation alſo? Sure they have no deſign on my perſon; if ſo, they will not take it ſo eaſily as they did my dear antelopes.</q> Thus he reſolved to exerciſe his quarter ſtaff, if they offered to lay hands on him. The villains, whoſe deſign was to bind him, and ſo carry him away, ſeeing him armed and reſolute, did not judge it ſafe for them to advance within the reach of his weapon, but keep at ſome diſtance, divining how to ſeize him.</p>
               <p>Quarll, who, by their conſulting, gueſſed at their deſign, not thinking proper to let them come to a reſolution, makes at the neareſt, who immediately takes to his heels, and then to the next, who immediately does the ſame. Thus he follows them about for a conſiderable time; but they divided, in order to the him with run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, till the night approaching, and the wind riſing, made them fear their retreat might be dangerous, if they deferred it; ſo that they went clear away: which being all he deſired,
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:030190_0176_0FE506AA8A923128"/>
he returned as ſoon as he ſaw them in the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat, which they rowed to their ſhip, that lay at anchor ſome diſtance from the rocks.</p>
               <p>Theſe wretches being gone, he returns Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thanks for his deliverance; and as his bridge had favoured their coming, he pulls it off, and only laid it over when he had a mind to view the ſea, and goes home to eat a bit, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not as yet broken his faſt. Having, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, eaten ſome of his roots and cheeſe, and being wearied with hunting theſe boors, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults how to lie, his bed and bedding being gone, as alſo his winter gown, and the nights being as yet cold: however, after a ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, he concludes to lie in the lodge, which was left vacant by the ſtolen antelopes abſence; whoſe litter being made of the ſame graſs as his mats were, he lay both ſoft and warm.</p>
               <p>Next morning having paid his uſual devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he goes into the kitchen, in order to breakfaſt, and afterwards to take his cuſtomary walk. Whilſt he was eating, there aroſe a noiſe in the air, as proceeding from a quantity of rooks, jackdaws, crows, and ſuch like birds, whoſe common notes he was acquainted with; and as the noiſe approached, he had the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to go and ſee what was the matter, but was prevented by the coming of a large fowl, which flew over his head, as he was going out; he turned back to gaze at the bird, whoſe beauty ſeized him with admiration; the pleaſure of ſeeing ſo charming a creature quite put out of his mind the curioſity of looking from whence proceeded the diſagreeable noiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:030190_0177_0FE506AC150CB3D0"/>
which ceaſing as ſoon as the bird was ſheltered, made him imagine thoſe carrion birds had been chaſing that beautiful fowl, which, ſeeing itſelf out of danger, ſtood ſtill, very calm and compoſed; which gave him the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of making a diſcuſſion of every individual beauty which compoſed; ſo delightful an object; it was about the bigneſs and form of a ſwan, almoſt headed like it, only the bill was not ſo long nor ſo broad, and red like coral; his eyes like thoſe of a hawk, his head of a mazarine blue, and on the top of it a tuft of ſhining gold coloured feathers, which ſpread over it, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near three inches beyond, all round; its breaſt, face, and part of its neck, milk white, curiouſly ſpeckled with ſmall black ſpots, a gold coloured circle about it; its back and neck behind of a fine crimſon, ſpeckled with purple; its legs and feet the ſame colour as its bill; its tail long and round, ſpreading like that of a peacock, compoſed of ſix rows of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, all of different colours, which made a moſt delightful mixture.</p>
               <p>Having ſpent ſeveral minutes in admiring the bird, he lays peas, and crumbled roots, both roaſted and boiled, before it; as alſo water in a ſhell, withdrawing, to give it liberty to eat and drink; and ſtood peeping to ſee what it would do: which, being alone, having looked about, picks a few peas, and drinks heartily; then walks towards the door in a compoſed eaſy manner, much like that of a cock.</p>
               <p>Quarll being at the outſide, was dubious whether he ſhould detain him, or let him go;
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:030190_0178_0FE506AD9F0B0198"/>
his affection for that admirable creature equally prompts him to both: he cannot bear the thoughts of parting with ſo lovely an object, nor harbour that of depriving it of liberty, which it ſo implicitly intruſted him withal. Thus after a a ſmall pauſe, generoſity prevails over ſelf-pleaſure; "Why ſhould I," ſaid he, "make the place of its refuge its priſon?" He therefore makes room for it to go, which, with a ſlow pace, walks out; and having look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about a ſmall time, mounts up a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able height; and then takes its courſe north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt.</p>
               <p>There happening nothing the remainder of the year worthy of record, he employs it in his cuſtomary occupations; as pruning and watering his lodge and dairy, making his mats to lie on, as alſo his winter garb; every day milking his antelopes and goats; making now and then butter and cheeſe, attending his nets, and ſuch like neceſſary employments.</p>
               <p>The mean time, the French mariners, who, probably, got money by what they had taken from him the year before, returned, it being much about the ſame ſeaſon; and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to take him away, and all they could make any thing of, out of the iſland, were provided with hands and implements to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh their deſign; as ropes to bind what they could get alive, and guns to ſhoot what they could not come at, ſaws and hatchets to cut down logwood and brazil, pick-axes and ſhov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els to dig up orris roots, and others of worth, which they imagined the iſland produced; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe flat bottomed boats to tow in ſhallow wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:030190_0179_0FE506B9F3356000"/>
where others could not come; and thus by degrees to load their ſhip with booty: but ever watchful Providence blaſted their evil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and confounded their devices, at the very inſtant they thought themſelves ſure of ſucceſs; implements in a flat-bottomed boat were towed to the very foot of the rock, by a young fellow, who being lighter than a man, was thought fitteſt to go with the tools, which pretty well loaded the boat.</p>
               <p>Their materials being landed, to their great ſatisfaction, the men on board embarked in two more of the ſame ſort of boats; but were no ſooner in them, but a ſtorm aroſe, which daſhed their ſlender bottoms to pieces, and waſhed them into the ſea, in which they periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, overſetting alſo the flat bottomed boat on ſhore, with the load, and the lad underneath it.</p>
               <p>The ſtorm being over, which laſted from about eight in the morning till almoſt twelve at noon, Quarll, according to his cuſtom, went to ſee if he could perceive any damage done by the late tempeſt, and if any, diſtreſſed by it, ſtood in want of help.</p>
               <p>Being at that ſide of the rock he uſed to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, he could ſee nothing but a few fiſhes and ſhells the ſea had left in the clifts: <q>If this, ſaid he, be all the damage that has been done, make me thankful; it will recruit me with freſh fiſh and utenſils.</q> Going to the N. W. part, where he ſees a battered boat, floating with the keel upwards, "This," ſaid he, "bodes ſome miſchief;" but thought it not to be of any conſequence. Having gone about
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:030190_0180_0FE506BCF8768B48"/>
fifty yards further, he eſpies a ſmall barrel at the foot of the rock, with ſeveral planks and fragments of a ſhip, floating with the tide: <q>Alas! ſaid he, theſe are too evident proofs of a ſhipwreck, to hope otherwiſe.</q> As he was looking about, he hears a voice cry out, much like that of a man, at ſome diſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a part of the rock: being advanced a ſmall matter beyond where he was, <q>Heaven be praiſed! ſaid he, there is ſomebody, whom I am luckily come to ſave, and he is moſt fortunately come to be my companion: I cannot but rejoice at the event, though I heartily grieve for the accident.</q> Haſtening to the place where he thought the cries came from, which, as he advanced, he could diſcern to be too ſhrill for a man's voice, <q>Certainly, ſaid he, this muſt be ſome woman by the noiſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He then, with his ſtaff, endeavoured to break that which he took to be the lid of the cheſt, but proved the bottom; and, as he was ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the boy underneath, calling to him to turn it up, thruſt his hand under the ſide, which he perceiving, though he underſtood him not, ſtood ſtill. Finding his miſtake, <q>This, ſaid he, is a flat bottomed boat, ſuch as the Frenchmen uſed the year before, when they came and plundered me. Now, am I ſafe if I turn it up? doubtleſs they are come in great numbers.</q> Pauſing awhile, and the lad (whom he took to be a woman) ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing his moan, he was moved to compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and, having conſidered the boat could not hold any great number, he ventures. <q>Let
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:030190_0181_0FE506BF5D3182C0"/>
what will come on it, or who will be under, for the poor woman's ſake I will relieve them; there cannot be many men. However I will let but one out at a time; if he be miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, I am able to deal with him.</q> At this, he puts the end of his ſtaff where he had ſeen the hand, and lifts it up about a foot from the ground. Out of the opening immediately creeps the boy, who, on his knees, falls a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and weeping, expecting death every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as being the merited puniſhment for the evil purpoſe he came about.</p>
               <p>Being affected with his ſupplications, though the ſight of the preparations made for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ruin had moved him to anger againſt his mercenary companions, he helps the young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up by the hand; and the night coming on apace, he takes one of the hatchets that lay by, and gave another to the boy, then falls a knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the boat to pieces, and directed him to do the ſame, which he accordingly did.</p>
               <p>The boat being demoliſhed, they carried the boards up higher on the rock, as alſo the reſt of the things; leſt, in the night, ſome ſtorm ſhould riſe, which might waſh them back into the ſea; it being then too late to bring them away. Having done, they each of them took up what they could carry, and ſo went home. The young Frenchman, finding a kinder treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than either he deſerved or expected, was extraordinary ſubmiſſive and tractable; which made Quarll the more kind and mild; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of condemning his evil attempt, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerated his misfortune, and in room of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment ſhowed him kindneſs. Thus having
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:030190_0182_0FE506C1044202F8"/>
given him of what he had to eat, he puts him to bed in his lodge, wherein he lay, till he had got his mats made up; then went to bed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>The next morning he roſe and walked about till he thought it time for the boy to riſe; he then calls him up, and takes him to the place that he uſually went to every morning and evening to ſing pſalms; where the youth being come, and hearing ſo many different voices, and ſeeing nobody, was ſcared out of his wits, and took to his heels, making towards the rock as faſt as he could; but as he was not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the eaſieſt and moſt practicable parts thereof, Quarll had made an end of his pſalm, and overtook him before he could get to the ſea-ſide, into which he certainly would have caſt himſelf at the fright; but Quarll, who, by the boy's ſtaring, gueſſed his diſorder, not having the benefit of the language, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to calm him by his pleaſing countenance, and prevented his drowning himſelf; but could not keep off a violent fit the fright had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, which held him ſeveral minutes.</p>
               <p>The fit being over, he and the boy took away at divers times the remains of the boat, and what was in it, which they could not carry home the day before: then taking up two guns, <q>Now, ſaid he, theſe unlucky inſtruments, which were intended for deſtruction, ſhall be employed for the preſervation of that they were to deſtroy;</q> and taking them to his lodge, ſets them at each ſide of the door; then being dinner time, he ſtrikes a light and ſets the boy to make a fire, whilſt he made ſome
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:030190_0183_0FE506CA5836EDC8"/>
of the fiſh fit to fry, which he picked up upon the rock the evening before; then takes the dripping he ſaved, when he roaſted any fleſh, to fry them with. The boy, who had lived ſome time in Holland, where they uſed much butter, ſeeing dripping employed in room thereof, thought to pleaſe his maſter in making ſome; and as he had ſeen milk and cream in the dairy arbour, wanting a churn only, there being a ſmall rundlet lying empty, he takes out one of the ends of it, in which, the next day, he beat butter.</p>
               <p>Quarll, ſeeing this youth induſtrious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to fancy him, notwithſtanding the averſion he had conceived for his nation, ever ſince the ill treatment he had received from his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen; and, as ſpeech is one of the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary faculties to breed and maintain fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, he took pains to teach him Engliſh.</p>
               <p>The lad being acute and ingenious was ſoon made to underſtand it, and in ſix months ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to ſpeak it ſufficiently, ſo as to give his maſter a relation of his late coming, and to what intent. <q>The men, ſaid he, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one year ſince carried away from hence ſome antelopes, with extraordinaty ducks, and ſeveral rarities, which they ſaid belonged to a monſtrous Engliſh Hermit, whoſe hair and beard covered his whole body, having got a great deal of money by ſhowing them, encouraged others to come; whereupon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral joining together, hired a ſhip to fetch away the Hermit, and what elſe they could find; therefore brought with them tools, and guns to ſhoot what they could not take alive.</q>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="179" facs="unknown:030190_0184_0FE506CD44CDB0C8"/>
Barbarous wretches! replied he, to kill my dear antelopes and ducks! pray, what did they intend to do with me?</q> 
                  <q>Why, ſaid the boy, to make a ſhow of you.</q> 
                  <q>To make a ſhow of me! Sordid wretches! is a Chriſtian then ſuch a rarity amongſt them? well, and what were the ſaws and hatchets for?</q> 
                  <q>To cut down your houſe, which they intended to make a drinking booth of.</q> 
                  <q>Oh monſtrous! what time and nature has been fifteen years a completing, they would have ruined in a moment: well, thanks to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, their evil deſign is averted. Pray, what is become of thoſe ſacrilegious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons?</q> 
                  <q>They are all drowned, ſaid the boy.</q> 
                  <q>Then, replies he, the heavens are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and I avenged: but how cameſt thou to eſcape? for thou waſt with them.</q> 
                  <q>No, replied the youth, I was upon the rock when their boat was daſhed againſt it, and was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with the ſame ſea, under the flat-bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed boat, where you found me.</q> 
                  <q>That was a happy overſet for thee. Well, is there no gratitude due to Providence for thy eſcape?</q> 
                  <q>Due to Providence? ſaid he, why, I thought you had ſaved me: I am ſure you let me out.</q> 
                  <q>Yes, replied Quarll; but I was ſent by Providence for that pupoſe.</q> 
                  <q>That was kindly done too, ſaid the boy; Well, when I ſee him, I will thank him: Doth he live hereabout?</q> 
                  <q>Poor ignorant creature! replied Quarll; why Providence is every where. What! didſt thou never hear of Providence? What religion art thou of?</q> 
                  <q>Religion! anſwered the youth: I
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:030190_0185_0FE506CED1C01140"/>
don't know what you mean: I am a fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by trade, which my father lived by.</q> 
                  <q>Well, ſaid Quarll, did he teach thee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe? no prayers?</q> 
                  <q>Prayers! repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the lad; why fiſhermen have no time to pray; that is for them who have nothing elſe to do: poor folks muſt work and get money; that is the way of our town.</q> 
                  <q>Covetous wretches! Well, ſaid he, I grudge them not what they poſſeſs, ſince it is all the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs they aſpire at; but thou ſhalt learn to pray, which will be of far more advantage to thee than work, both here and hereafter:</q> from which time he begins to teach him the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments; as alſo the principles of the Chriſtian religion; all which inſtructions the youth taking readily, won his affection the more: he likewiſe taught him to ſing pſalms, which farther qualified him to be his companion in ſpiritual exerciſes, as well as in temporal occupations.</p>
               <p>Now, having company, he is obliged to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his bed, the lodge being wanted for his antelope againſt breeding time: he adds, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to his mats. His other proviſions alſo wanting to be augmented, and he having both tools and boards, out of the flat boat which he had taken to pieces, he and the lad went about making large boxes to ſalt fleſh and fiſh in; then, with the boards that were left, they made a table for his dwelling that he had before, and one for his kitchen; as alſo ſhelves in the room of thoſe that were made of wicker: then hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recruited his ſhell utenſils that were ſtolen the year before, he was completely furniſhed
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:030190_0186_0FE506D1DE5B0AB8"/>
with all manner of conveniences; and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſupplying him daily with other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, there was no room left him for wiſhes, but for thankſgiving, which they daily moſt religiouſly paid.</p>
               <p>In this moſt happy ſtate they lived in peace and concord the ſpace of ten years, unanimouſly doing what was to be done, as it lay in each of their ways, without relying on one another.</p>
               <p>Quarll, who before, though alone and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of ſociety (the principal comfort of life), thought himſelf bleſſed, now cannot expreſs his happineſs, there being none in the world to be compared to it, heartily praying he might find no alteration until death: but the young man, not having met with ſo many diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the world as he, had not quite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn his affections from it; his mind ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times will run upon his native country, where he has left his relations, and where he cannot help wiſhing to be himſelf: thus, an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity offering itſelf one day, as he went to get oyſters, to make ſome ſauce for ſome freſh cod-fiſh which Quarll was dreſſing, he ſaw, at a diſtance, a ſhip; at which his heart fell a panting; his pulſes double their motion; his blood grows warmer and warmer, till at laſt, inflamed with deſire of getting at it, he lays down the bag he brought to put the oyſters in, as alſo the inſtrument to dredge them up with, and takes to ſwimming. The men on board, having eſpied him out, ſent their boat to take him up; ſo he went away without taking leave of him he had received ſo much good from; who, having waited a conſiderable time, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:030190_0187_0FE4FD12CF4D9E28"/>
ſome accident would befal him, leaves his cooking, and goes to ſee for him; and, being come at the place where he was to get the oyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he ſees the bag and inſtruments lie, and nobody with them. Having called ſeveral times without being anſwered, various racking fears tortured his mind: ſometimes he doubts he is fallen in ſome hole of the rock, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many near that place where the oyſters were: he therefore with his ſtaff, which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways carried with him when he went abroad, at the other ſide of the rock grabbled in every one round the place; and, feeling nothing, he concludes ſome ſea-monſter had ſtolen him away, and, weeping, condemns himſelf as the cauſe of this fatal accident; reſolving for the future, to puniſh himſelf by denying his appetite; and only eat to ſupport nature, and not to pleaſe his palate.</p>
               <p>Having given over hopes of getting him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he returns home in the greateſt affliction, reſolving to faſt till that time the next day; but, happening to look weſtward, in which point the wind ſtood, he perceives ſomething like a boat at a great diſtance: wiping the tears off his eyes, and looking ſtedfaſtly, he diſcovers a ſail beyond it, which quite altered the motive of his former fear: <q>No monſter, ſaid he, hath devoured him: it is too plain a caſe, that he has villainouſly left me: but what could I expect of one who had project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch evil againſt me?</q> So ſaying he went home, and made an end of dreſſing his dinner; reſting himſelf contented, being but as he was before, and rather better, ſince he
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:030190_0188_0FE506DE5E48D2A8"/>
had more conveniences, and tools to till his ground, and dig up his roots with. Having recommended himſelf to Providence, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes his uſual works and recreations, reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that no cares ſhall mar his happineſs for the future, being out of the way of all thoſe irreſiſtible temptations with which the world abounds, to lay the beſt men's hopes in the duſt.</p>
               <p>Being again alone, the whole buſineſs of the houſe lies upon his hands; he muſt now prune and trim the habitation that daily harbours him, being made of fine growing plants, which yearly ſhoot out young branches: this makes them grow out of ſhape. He muſt alſo till the ground; ſet and gather his peas and beans in their ſeaſon; milk and feed his antelopes daily; make butter and cheeſe at proper times; dig up his roots; fetch in fuel and water when wanted; attend his nets; go to deſtroy eagles neſts; and every day dreſs his own victuals: all which neceſſary occupations, beſides the time dedicated for his uſual devotions, kept him wholly employed; which made his renewed ſolitude leſs irkſome. And, having walked all that afternoon to divert his thoughts, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring all the way the wonderful works of nature, both in the ſurpriſing rocks which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the iſland, and in the delightful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and admirable plants, that are in it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weary with walking, he returns home, thanking kind Providence for ſettling him in ſo bleſſed a place, and in his way calls at his inviſible choir; where, having ſung a thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving pſalm, and his uſual evening hymn, he goes to ſupper, and then to bed, with a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:030190_0189_0FE506DFE8A68A38"/>
contented mind; which occaſions plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant dreams, to entertain his thoughts.</p>
               <p>There happening a great noiſe of ſquealing, it waked him out of his dream; and his mind being impreſſed with notions of war, it at firſt ſeized him with terror: but being ſomewhat ſettled, and the noiſe ſtill continuing, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it proceeded from the two different kinds of monkeys in the iſland, which were fighting for the wild pomegranates that the high wind had ſhaken off the trees the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding night which was very boiſterous.</p>
               <p>Having gueſſed the occaſion of their debate, he riſes, in order to go and quell their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by dividing amongſt them the cauſe thereof. Getting up, he opens the door, at the outſide of which, an old monkey of each ſort were quietly waiting his levee, to entice him to come, as he once before did, and put an end to their bloody war.</p>
               <p>He was not a little ſurpriſed to ſee two ſuch inveterate enemies, who at other times never meet without fighting, at that juncture agree ſo well.</p>
               <p>That moſt ſurpriſing ſign of reaſon in thoſe brutes, which, knowing his deciſion would compoſe their comrades difference, came to implore it, put him upon theſe reflexions: <q>Would princes, ſaid he, be but reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as thoſe which by nature are irrational, how much blood and money would be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</q> having admired the uneaſineſs of thoſe poor creatures, who ſtill went a few ſteps for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and then backward to him; he was in hopes to decoy one or both into his lodge, by
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:030190_0190_0FE506E172561008"/>
throwing meat to them: but thoſe exemplary animals, hearing their fellows in trouble, had no regard to their ſeparate intereſt, taking no notice of what he gave them; but kept walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to and again with all the tokens of unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs they could expreſs; which ſo moved him, that he haſtened to the place; where his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence cauſed immediately a ceſſation of arms, and both parties retired a conſiderable diſtance from each other, waiting his ſharing the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls; which being done, they quietly took that heap which lay next each kind, and went to their different quarters.</p>
               <p>Fourteen years more being paſſed, every thing keeping its natural courſe, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened nothing extraordinary, each ſucceeding year renewing the pleaſures the preceding had produced. Thunders and high winds being frequent, though not equally violent, he thought it not material to record them, or their effects; as blowing and throwing fiſhes, ſhells, empty veſſels, battered cheſts, &amp;c. upon the rock; only tranſactions and events wonderful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common: and there happened a moſt ſurpriſing one a few days after, which though of no great moment, is as worthy of record as any of far greater concern; being a wonderful effect of Providence, manifeſted in a miraculous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, though not to be ſaid ſupernatural.</p>
               <p>One morning, when he had roaſted a parcel of thoſe roots which he uſed to eat inſtead of bread, and this he commonly did once a week, they eating beſt when ſtale; having ſpread them on his table and cheſt to cool, he went
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:030190_0191_0FE506F108A21540"/>
out to walk, leaving his door open to let the air in.</p>
               <p>His walk, though graced with all the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables nature could adorn it with to make it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful; a graſs carpet, embroidered with beautiful flowers, of many different colours and ſmells, under his feet, to tread on; before, and on each ſide of him, fine lofty trees, of various forms and heights, cloathed with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant green leaves, trimmed with rich bloſſoms of many colours, to divert his eye; a number of various ſorts of melodious ſinging birds perching in their moſt lovely ſhades, as though nature had ſtudied to excel man's brighteſt imagination, and exquiſiteneſs of art: yet all theſe profuſeneſſes of nature's wonders are not ſufficient to keep away or expel anxious thoughts from his mind. It runs upon his two dear an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telopes, the darling heads of his preſent ſtock, which he took ſuch care to bring up, and were ſo engaging, always attending him in thoſe fine walks; adding, by their ſwift races, active leapings, and other uncommon diverſions, to the natural pleaſantneſs of the place; which now, by their moſt lamented abſence, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a dull memorandum of the barbarous manner in which they were raviſhed away from him.</p>
               <p>In theſe melancholy thoughts, which his loneſomeneſs every now and then created, he returns home, where Providence had left a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for his grievance: a companion, far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding any he ever had, waits his return; which was a beautiful monkey of the fineſt kind, and the moſt complete of the ſort, as
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:030190_0192_0FE506F2A3F644B0"/>
though made to manifeſt the unparalleled ſkill of nature, and ſent him by Providence to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate his melancholy.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Being come to his lodge, and beholding that wonderful creature, and in his own poſſeſſion, at the fartheſt end of it, and him at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance thereof to oppoſe its flight, if offered, he is at once filled with joy and admiration: <q>Long, ſaid he, I endeavoured in vain to get one, and would have been glad of any, though of the worſt kind, and even of the meaneſt of the ſort; and here kind Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has ſent me one of an unparalleled beauty.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having a conſiderable time admired the beaſt, which all the while ſtood unconcerned, now and then eating of the roots that lay before him, he ſhuts the door, and goes in, with a reſolution of ſtaying within all day in order to
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:030190_0193_0FE506F46FA649B8"/>
tame him, which he hoped would be no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter, his diſpoſition being already pretty familiar, little thinking that Providence, who ſent him thither, had already qualified him for the commiſſion he bore; which having found out by the creature's ſurpriſing docility, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns his Benefactor his moſt hearty thanks for that miraculous gift.</p>
               <p>This moſt wonderful animal, having by its ſurpriſing tractability and good nature, joined to its matchleſs handſomeneſs, gained its maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's love, beyond what is uſual to place on any ſort of beaſts; he thought himſelf doubly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed for all his former loſſes, eſpecially for that of his late ungrateful companion, who, notwithſtanding all the obligations he held from him, baſely left him, at a time he might be moſt helpful; and as he fancied his dear Beauſiddle (for ſo he called that admirable creature) had ſome ſort of reſemblance to the picture he framed of him, he takes it down, thinking it unjuſt to bear in his ſight that vile object, which could not in any wiſe claim a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſo worthy a creature as his beloved mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key.</p>
               <p>One day that Quarll had occaſion to go out, he happened to leave his pen and ink upon the table and ſome parchment he had been writing on cloſe by it; Beauſiddle perceiving his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from home, immediately falls to work, ſcribbling over every word Quarll had been writing; and when done, he laid it by in the cheſt, as he ſaw his maſter do with what he had written; he then takes out another, which he does the ſame to, and ſo to half a dozen more,
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:030190_0194_0FE506F5FAD87BD0"/>
until his maſter's return prevented his doing any more miſchief; however, in a quarter of an hour that he was abſent, he blotted out as much as had taken full ſix months in writing.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Another day, as this lovely animal was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiating the charge it had of its own accord taken, being gone for wood, as wont to do when wanted, he finds in his way a wild pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate, whoſe extraordinary ſize and weight had cauſed it to fall off the tree: he takes it home, and then returns for his faggot; in which time Quarll, wiſhing the goodneſs of the inſide might anſwer its outward beauty, cuts it open; and, finding it of a dull luſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, too flat for eating, imagined it might be uſed with things of an acid and ſharp taſte; having therefore boiled ſome water, he puts it into a veſſel, with a ſort of an herb which is of taſte and nature of creſſes, and ſome of the
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:030190_0195_0FE5070A11337910"/>
pomegranate, letting them infuſe ſome time, now and then ſtirring it; which the monkey having taken notice of, did the ſame: but one very hot day, happening to lay the veſſel in the ſun, made it turn ſour.</p>
               <p>Quarll, who very much wanted vinegar in his ſauces, was well pleaſed with the accident, and ſo continued the ſouring of the liquor, which proving excellent, he made a five gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon veſſel of it, having ſeveral which at times he found upon the rock.</p>
               <p>Having now ſtore of vinegar, and being a great lover of pickles, which he had learnt to make by ſeeing his wife, who was an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary cook, and made of all ſorts every year; calling to mind he had often in his walks ſeen ſomething like muſhrooms, he makes it his buſineſs to look for ſome: thus he picked up a few, of which Beauſidelle (who followed him up and down) having taken notice, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ranges about, and being nimbler footed than his maſter, and not obliged to ſtoop ſo low, picked double the quantity in the ſame ſpace of time; ſo that he ſoon had enough to ſerve him till the next ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>His good ſucceſs in making that ſort of pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle encourages him to try another; and, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken notice of a plant in the wood that bears a ſmall green flower, which, before it is blown, looks like a caper, he gathers a few: and, their taſte and flavour being no way diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable, judging that, when pickled, they would be pleaſant, he tries them, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his mind, were full as good as the real ones; and gathers a ſufficient quantity,
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:030190_0196_0FE5070BEF685A40"/>
with the help of his attendant, ſtocking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with two as pleaſant pickles as different ſorts. But there is another which he admires above all: none, to his mind like the cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and the iſland producing none, left him no room to hope for any; yet (as likeneſs is a vaſt help to imagination) if he could but find any thing, which ever ſo little reſembles them in make, nature, or taſte, it will pleaſe his fancy: he therefore examines every kind of buds, bloſſoms, and ſeeds; having at laſt ſound that of a wild parſnip, which being long and narrow, almoſt the bigneſs and make of a pickling cucumber, green and criſp withal, full of a ſmall flat ſeed, not unlike that of the thing he would have it to be, he pickles ſome of them; which being of a colour, and near upon the make, he fancies them quite of the taſte.</p>
               <p>His beans being at that time large enough for the firſt crop, he gathers ſome for his din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: the ſhells being tender and of a delicate green, it came into his mind, they might be made to imitate French beans: <q>they are, ſaid he, near the nature, I can make them quite of the ſhape, ſo be they have the ſame ſavour.</q> Accordingly he cuts them in long narrow ſlips, and pickles ſome; the other part he boils; and there being none to contradict their taſte, they paſſed current for as good French beans as any that ever grew.</p>
               <p>The diſappointment of having ſomething more comfortable than water to drink being retrieved by producing, in the room thereof, wherewithal to make his eatables more delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

he proceeds in his firſt project; and, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary care to prevent that accident which intercepted ſucceſs in his firſt undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he accompliſhes his deſign, and makes a liquor no wiſe inferior to the beſt cyder; ſo that now he has both to revive and keep up his ſpirits, as well as to pleaſe his palate, and ſuit his appetite.</p>
               <p>Having now nothing to crave or wiſh for, but rather all motives for content; he lies down with a peaceable mind, no care or fear diſturbing his thoughts: his ſleep is not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with frightful fancies, but rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted with pleaſant and diverting dreams; he is not ſtartled at thunder or ſtorms, though ever ſo terrible, his truſt being on Providence, who at ſundry times, and in various manners, has reſcued him from death, though apparently unavoidable; being for above thirty years mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly protected and maintained in a place ſo remote from all human help and aſſiſtance.</p>

                  <hi>THE following Sketch of Univerſal Hiſtory was written by a gentleman for the uſe of two young ladies, and not intended for publication; but as it was deſigned to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply what he thought was wanting to give the minds of children ſome idea of general hiſtory, and as it perfectly anſwered the purpoſe for which he compoſed it, he has been induced to publiſh it, that others might reap the ſame advantage which thoſe have for whoſe uſe it was particularly compoſed.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>There are, it is true, many abridgments of Sacred, Greek, Roman, and Engliſh Hiſtories; but ſome ſhort ſketch of General Hiſtory ſeems wanting; that the learner may be enabled to ſee how the ſeparate parts are connected with each other. This deficiency is here attempted to be ſupplied; and as young minds are too volatile to be long fixed, it is drawn on as ſmall a ſcale as poſſible: on the ſame account it was thought proper not to load it with chronological dates, but to throw it into a conciſe and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple narrative, that the connexion of the ſucceſſive events
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:030190_0199_0FE4FDBD6F3232F8"/>
with each other might be readily acquired, and eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained when acquired.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The author has carefully avoided the giving a greater ſpace to thoſe circumſtances which are neareſt the preſent time: for though in larger hiſtories this muſt neceſſarily happen from the increaſing quantity of materials, yet it is a fault in a work of this ſort, ſince it tends to impreſs on the duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile imagination of youth wrong ideas of chronology which are not eaſily eradicated, as the mind will be apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect the length of the aera with the number of the pages it occupies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The author of theſe pages is free to confeſs that his own imagination, even in riper years, was ſo much biaſſed by this early prejudice, that it coſt him ſome pains to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it; and he will venture to ſay, that many perſons of no inconſiderable hiſtorical knowledge will find the time beſtowed on a careful peruſal of this Sketch, accompanied with an inſpection of Doctor Prieſtley's Hiſtorical and Biographical Charts, by no means thrown away.</hi>

            <div type="history">
               <p>THE earlieſt information we have of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mankind is from the Holy Scriptures. We have there an account of the creation of the world, the deſtruction of it by the Flood, the the renewal of mankind by the family of Noah, who were preſerved in the Ark, and their increaſe and diſperſion over the whole face of the earth. The Scriptures then proceed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally with the hiſtory of the deſcendants of Abraham, whoſe great grandſon Joſeph ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling in Egypt with his eleven brothers, they became, with their progeny, ſlaves to that powerful people. But increaſing in proceſs of time, they migrated from thence and ſettled in
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:030190_0200_0FE4FE82D3AAFD08"/>
Paleſtine, after many wars, expelling the old inhabitants, who are called in our tranſlation of the Bible, Philiſtines. The deſcendants of Abraham ſtyled themſelves Iſraelites, or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, from Jacob, the father of Joſeph, who was alſo named Iſrael. They divided the country among their twelve tribes, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the names of the twelve ſons of Jacob, from whom they were ſeverally deſcended. At firſt they were governed by magiſtrates called Judges; and afterwards by Kings. In the reign of Rehoboam, their fourth King, ſon to Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and grandſon to David, ten of the tribes revolted, under a leader named Jeroboam, leaving two tribes only, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Juda and Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin, under Rehoboam, whoſe deſcendants were called Kings of Juda, from whence the name of Jews was derived; and the ſucceſſors of Jeroboam were called Kings of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>Several powerful nations aroſe in their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, which all became in time ſubject to the empire of Aſſyria. To ſuch a formidable enemy the offspring of Abraham were an eaſy conqueſt: the ten tribes of Iſrael were carried into captivity, and their name no more heard of among the nations: the chief perſon among the Jews were alſo carried to Babylon, the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital of Aſſyria; but the people were permitted to remain at home under the dominion of their conquerors.</p>
               <p>Soon after this a new power aroſe. The King of Aſſyria turned his arms againſt the Medes and Perſians. Cambyſes, King of Perſia, had married Mandane, daughter of Aſtyages, King of Media. The firſt attack of the Aſſyrians
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:030190_0201_0FE4FE87A6B218F0"/>
was againſt Media. The Perſians ſent Cyrus, ſon of Cambyſes and Mandane, at the head of an army, to the aſſiſtance of his uncle Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axares, who was then King. The invader was repelled, invaded in his turn, the King of Aſſyria killed at the taking of Babylon, and the whole empire reduced under the dominion of the Medes and Perſians; over both of whom Cyrus reigned, by marrying the only daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his uncle Cyaxares. Thus was the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian empire founded.</p>
               <p>The Perſian empire extended over all the known parts of Aſia: and the ambition of Darius, a ſucceſſor though not a deſcendant of Cyrus, induced him to attempt the conqueſt of part of Europe; but here he met with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere repulſe from the Grecian republics.</p>
               <p>This ſmall people, who inhabited a country of narrow extent, were not only able by their courage and military ſkill to check this power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful invader, but they had made ſuch a profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in wiſdom and arts, that we may now ſay, every attainment modern Europe has made in both is principally, if not ſolely, derived from them. The origin of this ſingular people is very uncertain. The firſt time they made any conſpicuous figure in the annals of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, was in the Trojan war, which has been rendered immortal by the poems of Homer. At that time they were divided into ſmall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, under limited monarchs; all of which, before the Perſian invaſion, were formed into republics.</p>
               <p>The Perſian King Darius deſpiſed ſuch feeble antagoniſts; but both he and his ſon Xerxes
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:030190_0202_0FE4FE8935FC9650"/>
ſoon learned, by fatal experience, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of valour and diſcipline over timid mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes. After the loſs of immenſe armies, the Kings of Perſia contented themſelves with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the differences which began to ariſe among the Grecian republics, in which Athens and Sparta took the lead; and remaining anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpectators of the bloody wars which they made with each other, when freed from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of a foreign enemy.</p>
               <p>While Greece was thus waſting her ſtrength in wars at home, great jealouſy was ſtill enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained leſt the common enemy (for ſo the King of Perſia was eſteemed) ſhould take advantage of her weakneſs to accompliſh his ambitious deſigns, when a ſtorm unexpectedly burſt on them from another quarter.</p>
               <p>There was a country to the north of Greece, called Macedonia, which, though in many reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects congenial with it, was looked on as bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous (for the Greeks called all nations but themſelves barbarians). Macedonia was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by an abſolute King. Philip, Prince of Macedonia, happening, on ſome occaſion, to be an hoſtage among the Greeks, had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, at the ſame time, of learning their art of war and ſeeing their internal diſſentions. Profiting by this knowledge, when he ſucceeded to the throne of Macedonia, he ſo contrived to embroil the affairs of Greece by corruption and intrigue, and by taking part, ſometimes with one party, and ſometimes with another, ſo to weaken the whole, that, having bribed the chiefs of ſome of the republics to his intereſt, and totally defeated the Athenians and their
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:030190_0203_0FE508459CE199B8"/>
allies at the battle of Chaeronea, he rendered Greece entirely dependent on himſelf.</p>
               <p>Knowing, however, the difficulty of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a people in peaceable ſubjection, he planned the popular ſcheme of an invaſion of Perſia; aſſembling for this purpoſe the whole force of Greece, and cauſing himſelf to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged chief of the confederacy. In the midſt of this undertaking he was aſſaſſinated, and was ſucceeded in his power by his ſon, diſtinguiſhed by the appellation of Alexander the Great.</p>
               <p>Alexander, immediately putting himſelf at the head of this formidable army, conquered the Perſian empire with all its depedencies, and, penetrating to the banks of the Ganges, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued even part of that country ſo well known to us by the name of the Eaſt Indies. But this immenſe empire was of ſhort duration; for, on his return, he died at Babylon, as ſome ſay, by poiſon, as others by exceſſive drinking, leaving his vaſt dominions to be divided among his generals. Aſia, Egypt, and Greece, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited a continual ſcene of war and deſolation; eſpecially Greece, where there were perpetual ſtruggles between the ſucceſſors of Alexander for dominion, and the republics for liberty, till the whole was reduced to ſubjection by the power of Rome.</p>
               <p>Rome, which makes ſo conſpicuous a figure in the hiſtory of mankind, aroſe from being a ſmall ſtate to the utmoſt extent of territory and power. At firſt it was governed by Kings, who were expelled for their tyranny, and two annual magiſtrates choſen in their place; theſe,
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:030190_0204_0FE4FD6966F2BFB8"/>
with the ſenate and aſſemblies of the people, formed the government, not unlike our Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Senate, and Houſe of Repreſentatives. The Romans ſoon engaged in wars with the other ſtates of Italy, all of which they finally conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; increaſing by thoſe means not only their ſtrength but their military knowledge; and as many of the Italian ſtates were Greek colonies, they had all the advantage of the Grecian art of war improved by their own experience. Being maſters of Italy, they turned their arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sicily, which engaged them in a war with Carthage, a powerful ſtate on the north of Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, who had colonies in that iſland. This war was proſecuted with various ſucceſs, till the perſeverance and courage of the Romans pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and Carthage was totally ſubdued.</p>
               <p>To return to the affairs of Greece: Rome made the aſſiſting the Greek republics a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for interfering in their diſputes, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reduced both the oppreſſors and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to an entire dependence on herſelf.</p>
               <p>The armies of Rome now became invincible. Not only Aſia, Egypt, Greece, and the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts of Africa, were ſubdued, but ſhe extended her conqueſts to Spain, Gaul, and Britain.</p>
               <p>Yet, amid theſe ſplendid ſcenes of victory abroad, Rome was torn to pieces by factions at home. At firſt the ſtruggles were between the ſenate and the people, till particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons obtaining power by holding long com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands abroad, the names of the popular, or noble party were only uſed as ſkreens to the ambition of individuals. The laſt great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:030190_0205_0FE4FD6AEECC87A0"/>
was between Julius Caeſar and Pompey; the firſt of whom had commanded in the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern, and the other in the eaſtern provinces. The deciſive battle of Pharſalia, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent death of Pompey, gave the whole Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man empire into the hands of Caeſar. The ſpirit of liberty, however, made one dying ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Caeſar was ſtabbed in the ſenate houſe, and an army raiſed in defence of public free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But after a ſhort war, the veteran troops of Caeſar, under command of Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius, his nephew and adopted heir, Marcus Antonius, his friend, and Lepidus, one of his generals, defeated the army of the republic, and the three leaders divided the empire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</p>
               <p>Lepidus, being a weak man, was ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; and M. Antonius, devoted to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſhut himſelf up in Egypt with Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra, the queen of that country. Octavius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, taking advantage of his indolence, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached on his provinces, and a war enſuing, Antonius was totally defeated at the naval bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Actium, ſoon after which he killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and Octavius remained ſole maſter of the Roman empire, with the title of Emperor, and the name of Auguſtus Caeſar; and Rome, with its vaſt territories, from this period be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſubject to the dominion of an arbitrary monarch.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour was born during the reign of Auguſtus, and ſuffered crucifixion under Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, his immediate ſucceſſor.</p>
               <p>From this time the whole civilized world being under one maſter, hiſtory for a long pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:030190_0206_0FE5076B476497E8"/>
has little elſe to record than the characters of the Roman Emperors; and mankind were happy or miſerable as their governors were mild or cruel. Perhaps the ſtate of the human race was never more enviable than when ſuch charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as Titus, Trajan, or the Antonines, were maſters of the world. While under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch monſters, as Caligula, Nero, and Domitian, who ſeemed to delight only in cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, mankind were in the moſt miſerable ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, unable either to reſiſt the power of the tyrant, or eſcape from his dominions, as there was no country out of the limits of the Roman empire that was not inhabited by the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage barbarians. It may not be amiſs here to mention, that, under the reign of Titus, tenth Emperor from Auguſtus, the city of Jeruſalem, after repeated rebellions, was finally deſtroyed by the Romans, and the Jews diſperſed, as they remain at this day: a ſingular inſtance of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who, having loſt their country, ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, though ſcattered over the face of the earth, their religion, their language, and their laws, the ſame as they were at a period far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any antiquity to which the annals of any the moſt ancient nation extend.</p>
               <p>Though the barbarous tribes that bordered on the Roman empire were continually infeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the frontiers with hoſtilities, and gradually encroaching on its provinces, yet it ſuffered no great diminution of territory till after the time of Conſtantine, who was the forty-firſt Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in ſucceſſion from Auguſtus, and lived up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of three hundred years after him</p>
               <p>During that period Chriſtianity had been
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:030190_0207_0FE4FD6DEB059C60"/>
gradually, though privately, extending itſelf. The profeſſors of it had been cruelly perſecuted by ſome of the Emperors, and tolerated by others; but Conſtantine was the firſt Emperor who openly profeſſed to be a Chriſtian, and from his time Chriſtianity became the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed religion of the empire.</p>
               <p>Conſtantine, from an abſurd vanity, remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the imperial ſeat from Rome to a city of his own building, between the Mediterranean and Euxine Seas, which he called Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolis, or the city of Conſtantine; and on his death he divided the empire between his ſons. From this time the Roman empire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of two parts; the one, whoſe ſeat conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued at Rome, was called the Weſtern Empire; the other, whoſe capital was Conſtantinople, was called the Eaſtern, and ſometimes the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Empire</p>
               <p>The empire, being thus divided, grew con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently weaker, and the inroads of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous nations more formidable. The Goths and Vandals attacked the Weſtern empire. The Franks, a brave, though uncivilized peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, poſſeſſed themſelves of Gaul, from whom it received the name of France. The Britons, on being abandoned by Rome to the inroads of the ſavage tribes in the north of the iſland, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Saxons to their aſſiſtance, who ſoon made themſelves maſters of the whole, except the mountains of Wales and Scotland, which afforded an aſylum to the ancient inhabitants. And Rome itſelf, under Auguſtulus, the laſt of its Emperors, was taken by Odoacer, King of the Heruli.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="unknown:030190_0208_0FE4FDB03577A710"/>
The Eaſtern empire was attacked by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens, a fierce people, who had embraced the religion of Mahomet, an impoſtor and founder of a new ſect, whoſe doctrine ſoon ſpread, and ſtill retains its influence in the Eaſt. This warlike race conquered Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and the northern coaſts of Africa; but they were, in their turn, expelled by the Turks, a nation of Scythian origin, who adopted the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and manners of the vanquiſhed. The provinces of the Eaſtern empire gradually mouldered away, till it was at laſt confined to the walls of Conſtantinople. A final period was put to the Roman empire ſo late as the year of our lord 1453, when Conſtantinople was taken by Mahomet, Sultan of the Turks, of whoſe dominion it has ever ſince remained the capital. This happened under Conſtantine X. (the hundred and fourteenth Emperor in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from Auguſtus), who was killed in the aſſault, 2200 years from the foundation of Rome, and during the reign of Henry VI. of England.</p>
               <p>This was the real end of the Roman empire; but previous to this, ſo early as the year of our Lord 800, there was a pretended revival of it in the perſon of Charlemagne, or Charles the Great.</p>
               <p>The barbarous tribes who overturned the Roman empire, having very obſcure notions of any religion, eaſily adopted that of the people they conquered; and as the Saracens, and after them the Turks, who ravaged the Eaſt, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the errours of Mahomet, which they found eſtabliſhed in Arabia, ſo the northern barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:030190_0209_0FE4FDB215AC1498"/>
who conquered Gaul, Germany, and Italy, were eaſily converted to the faith of Chriſt: and the Biſhop of Rome, who aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the title of Pope, and Patriarch of the Roman church, ſoon obtained the ſame influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over the Heruli, and the Lombards, who ſucceeded them, as he had over the Romans under their Chriſtian Emperors. But Deſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, the Lombard King of Italy, oppoſing the ambition of Pope Stephen III. the Pope called Charlemagne, King of France, to his aid, who dethroned Deſiderius and conquered Italy: as a reward for which, the Pope crowned him Emperor at Rome; and Charlemagne becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards maſter of Germany, and divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his dominions between his ſons, that to whom Germany fell retained the title of Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, which his ſucceſſors ſtill continue to aſſume: and the head of a limited elective mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, who reſides at Vienna, now calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Emperor of the Romans, and takes the names of Caeſar and Auguſtus.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time that Charlemagne made theſe conqueſts on the continent of Europe, Egbert united the ſeven provinces into which the Saxons had divided all the ſouthern part of Britain (except Wales) into one kingdom by the name of England.</p>
               <p>Theſe barbarians were no ſooner ſettled in their conqueſts, and in ſome degree civilized, than a freſh inundation poured in from the north, under the name of Danes and Normans, and, committing the ſame ravages on the new poſſeſſors which they had committed on the old inhabitants, at laſt fixed themſelves, part in
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:030190_0210_0FE5076CF05B6118"/>
Germany, part in England, and part in that province of France which yet retains the name of Normandy; and, as their predeceſſors had done, ſoon aſſumed the religion and manners of the vanquiſhed.</p>
               <p>As theſe northern nations ſettled over all the weſtern parts of Europe, which were divided by them into many ſtates, ſo the ſame form of government, derived from the ſame origin, was eſtabliſhed in them all. The leader of each army of invaders was conſidered as King, and in ſome meaſure as proprietor of the conquered territory. But as it was neceſſary to have an army ready at all times to repel new invaders, and guard againſt the encroachment of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, the King, or General, parceled out his land among the ſuperior officers, who, by way of acknowledgment, were bound to furniſh him with a proportionable aſſiſtance of men and arms in time of war, and to attend his councils in time of peace. And theſe leaders, to enable themſelves to command the requiſite number of troops which they were to furniſh, allotted part of their lands again to the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior officers and ſoldiers, on condition that they ſhould attend them to the wars when ſummoned by the King or the Lord Paramount. And this, which is called the feudal ſyſtem, is the origin of that limited monarchy, which, till within theſe two centuries, was eſtabliſhed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the greateſt part of Europe, and which Great Britain has preſerved to this time.</p>
               <p>Civilization had as yet made but a ſmall progreſs: the writings of the ancient Greeks and Romans, which are now the models of
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:030190_0211_0FE5077146754648"/>
every thing great and elegant, were confined to the hands of a bigoted clergy; and war was the ſole delight of princes and nobles too igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant even to write their names.</p>
               <p>This warlike ſpirit, however, was attended by ſome good conſequences: for the Saracens, who had over-run the eaſtern parts of Europe, began to turn their arms againſt the ſouthern parts of weſtern Europe: they threatened Italy, invaded the ſouth part of France, their African colonies had made themſelves maſters of the beſt part of Spain, and nothing leſs than the warlike turn of its inhabitants could have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all Europe from becoming a prey to theſe fierce barbarians, and the conſequent rudeneſs and deſpotiſm which ever have attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the religion of Mahomet wherever it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtian Doctrine, corrupted as it was by the Church of Rome, had yet a tendency to poliſh and ſoften the manners of its profeſſors; and even the power of the Pope, whoſe ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy was acknowledged by ſo many independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and turbulent princes, though often uſed for the purpoſes of ſuperſtition, was ſometimes alſo inſtrumental in ſtopping the progreſs, or mitigating the horrors of war.</p>
               <p>A new ſpirit of enterprize now took place in Europe. As the zeal for Chriſtianity increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the warlike princes and nobles who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed it beheld with indignation the ſcene of all the miracles, recorded both in the Old and New Teſtament, in the hands of infidels. The Pope encouraged this religious fervour; and vaſt armies were poured forth to reſcue theſe
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:030190_0212_0FE5077D1709CBF0"/>
conſecrated ſeats from the Mahometans. But, after deluging the plains of Paleſtine with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian blood, and making a conqueſt of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, which could not be retained, the votaries of Mahomet remained, and ſtill remain, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of that country which is commonly called the Holy Land.</p>
               <p>Some advantage, however, was derived from theſe enterprizes. Part of the immenſe armies that paſſed from Europe to Aſia, took their rout by Conſtantinople; and though, to their ſhame it muſt be owned, that while their end was to reſcue part of Aſia from the power of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, they themſelves committed devaſtation in the dominions of the only Chriſtian Prince in the eaſt of Europe, yet they were ſtruck with the magnificence of the court of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where ſome relics of the ſplendour of the Roman empire were ſtill preſerved. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced a taſte for the arts among the Princes of weſtern Europe; and on the Turks putting an end to the Eaſtern empire by the capture of Conſtantinople, the learned men of that city migrated into France, Italy, Germany, and Britain, and introduced there a knowledge of Grecian literature.</p>
               <p>Happily for the revival of learning, Leo X. who was then Pope, was as deſirous of extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing literature as ſome of his predeceſſors had been of ſpreading ignorance; he therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained the Grecian exiles, and encouraged letters among the clergy. At this time Europe was in a more pacific ſtate: England breathed after the long wars between York and Lancaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: France, from being divided among a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:030190_0213_0FE5077EC25077E0"/>
of independent nobles, each able to awe the titular King, became one powerful monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy: the Moors were driven out of Spain, and that whole country, which had formed many ſeparate kingdoms, was united by the marriage of Ferdinand of Caſtile and Iſabella of Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon: Germany was one large republic of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of whom the Emperor was the head; and Italy was divided into many ſmall ſtates, the chief of which were the kingdom of Naples, and the commonwealth of Venice.</p>
               <p>The Pope now found his authority ſhaken. As literature advanced, a ſpirit of inquiry took place, and the monſtrous errours grafted by the church of Rome on the pure religion of Chriſt began to be perceived. Luther and Calvin publiſhed their opinions on this ſubject, and had many followers, who, from proteſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the errours of the church of Rome, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the name of Proteſtants; and their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions prevailed in England, the northern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and part of Germany and Switzerland.</p>
               <p>About this time the art of navigation being greatly improved, a large continent was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the weſt, called America. Many colonies were ſoon formed there by the Engliſh, French, and Spaniards, which have occaſioned frequent wars among thoſe nations. From this period, as commerce has increaſed, mankind have become more civilized. Religion and politics for a time filled both England and France with inteſtine commotions. Charles I. of England was brought to the ſcaffold by his ſubjects, and Henry IV. of France was ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an enthuſiaſt. By the arts of Lewis
<pb facs="unknown:030190_0214_0FE507804D86E7E8"/>
XIV. France was brought to be an abſolute mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, without any legal reſtraint, indeed, on the power of the crown.</p>
               <p>The laſt king of this potent empire was Lewis XVI. who was born Auguſt 23, 1754, married to Maria Antoniette of Auſtria, May 16, 1770; aſcended to the throne upon the death of his grandfather Lewis XV. May 10, 1774; and was crowned at Rheims, June 12, 1775.</p>
               <p>About this period Great Britain, through a miſtaken policy, differed with her colonies in North America, now the UNITED STATES; and after a fruitleſs and bloody conteſt for ſome years, was compelled to acknowledge them free and independent.</p>
               <p>A revolution commences in France July 14th, 1789—Royalty aboliſhed 10th. Auguſt 1792—Lewis XVI. ordered for trial to the bar of the convention 11th. December—Sentence of death decreed him, 19th. January 1793, and guillotined 21ſt. January. His Queen, Maria Antoniette tried and executed 16th. October 1793.</p>
               <p>The hiſtory of France and Great Britain, eternal rivals in glory and intereſt, for the two laſt centuries, is in fact the hiſtory of the world. During that period, there has been no war of any conſequence between European powers in any part of the world in which they have not acted a principal part; and a war between them extends its influence from the ſhores of Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica to the banks of the Ganges. They have been conſtantly ready to attack each other on the moſt trivial occaſions, and even their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of peace have ſeemed rather ceſſations of
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:030190_0215_0FE507838F23EE48"/>
hoſtilities for the purpoſe of renewing them with greater vigour, than any permanent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. When and how the preſent fruitleſs and wanton quarrel (on the part of Great Britain) may terminate, time muſt deve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope; for the ſake of humanity we wiſh it at an end, and that the future conteſts of all-mankind may be, who ſhall excel moſt in arts of peace and the purſuits of literature!</p>

            <head>THE ELEPHANT.</head>
            <p>NEXT to Man, the Elephant is the moſt reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable of the Almighty's creatures. In ſize he exceeds all other terreſtrial animals; and by his underſtanding he approaches nearly to the human ſpecies. His temper is naturally gentle. Even while wild in the foreſts he thirſts not after blood, nor does he uſe his vaſt ſtrength, except in defending himſelf or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting his companions. His favourite food is rice, roots, and herbs; he abhors fiſh and fleſh. When he finds a plentiful paſture, he makes uſe of a particular cry, which gives notice to his comrades to come and partake of the dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which he has found. An invitation which they readily obey, to the great loſs of the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the land.—The Elephant is caught and tamed without difficulty. His love of ſociety renders him eaſy to be allured into a ſnare by others of his own ſpecies, who have been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:030190_0222_0FE507A200091438"/>
for that purpoſe. Two of theſe, after he is in confinement, conſtantly attend all his motions, and, when he is not diſpoſed to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, compel him by ſtriking him with their trunks to obedience. Very ſoon, however, his own aſtoniſhing judgment convinces him that no harm, is meant to him, and that his efforts towards reſiſtance are all in vain. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this, he applies himſelf to learn his duty, and becomes the mildeſt and moſt obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of all domeſtic animals. He ſoon learns to comprehend ſigns. He diſtinguiſhes the tone of command, of anger, and of approbation. He never miſtakes the voice of his maſter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives his orders with attention, and executes them with prudence and eagerneſs, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out precipitation. He ſeems to take pleaſure in being covered with gilded harneſs and gay houſings. He draws carriages, waggons, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, &amp;c. with evenneſs and good humour, provided he be not treated ill, undeſervedly, and that the people who are employed with him have the air of being pleaſed with his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. His conductor (ſtyled his Cornac) generally rides on the Elephant's neck and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in his hand a ſharp iron, with which, when neceſſary, he pricks the creature's head or ears, to make him move faſter; but this is ſeldom put in practice, ſince words are always ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, provided that the Cornac has had time to acquire the Elephant's confidence; after which the beaſt's attachment and affection become ſo ſtrong, that one is actually recorded to have died of grief, becauſe in a fit of paſſion he had killed his keeper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="218" facs="unknown:030190_0223_0FE507A843977AB8"/>
Before the invention of gunpowder, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants were uſed in war, and have often by their efforts decided the fate of battles. On their backs they carried ſmall towers which held five or ſix armed men; and from their trunks hung heavy chains, which they were taught to ſwing around them in order to break the ranks of the enemy's army. But now that fire is the chief inſtrument of death in battles, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, as he is ſubject to dread both the noiſe and the flame of fire-arms, would be dangerous to his own party. He is ſtill employed by Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans in the Eaſt for the purpoſe of tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the baggage of their troops, and by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian princes, for carrying their women in large cages covered with green branches of trees.</p>
            <p>Elephants are more numerous in Africa than in Aſia, the only two parts of the world where they are, naturally, found. In Africa they live uncontrouled, for they deſpiſe the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes as a ſet of unſkilful, weak beings, who have neither ſtrength nor art enough to reduce them to ſlavery. Thoſe of the Aſiatic iſland, Ceylon, are looked upon as the largeſt, boldeſt, and moſt intelligent of the whole ſpecies.</p>
            <p>The Elephant is ſtrong in proportion to his vaſt bulk. He can with eaſe carry from three to four thouſand weight; and on his tuſks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone he can ſupport upwards of one thouſand pounds. The quickneſs of his paces, when the immenſe weight of his body is conſidered, is a proof of his amazing ſtrength. His uſual walk equals the common trot of a horſe; and he can run as faſt as a horſe can gallop. He is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally permitted to walk when loaded, and can
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:030190_0224_0FE507B083899BF0"/>
with eaſe perform fifty miles in a day, but, when puſhed, can go almoſt twice as far. He will do as much work as ſix ſtrong horſes, but his price is immenſe, and the charge of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining him very great indeed. An Elephant who has been properly diſciplined is worth from four to five hundred guineas; and he will eat in a day above a hundred pounds of rice, beſides vegetables. In India all barrels, ſacks, and bales of goods are carried from place to place by Elephants, and if their necks and trunks have no more room for burthens, they will carry an additional weight in their mouth. The Elephant unites ſagacity with ſtrength, and never injures any thing committed to his charge, be it ever ſo delicate. He will carry each particular parcel to a boat in his trunk without wetting it; he will range each in order, will try whether each lies firm, and will actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place ſtones where neceſſary to prevent caſks from rolling from their proper ſtation.</p>
            <p>The trunk (or proboſcis) of this wonderful animal ought to be particularly deſcribed. It extends itſelf conſiderably beyond his mouth, and is terminated by a protuberance which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms all the offices of, and is by no means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to, a finger: with this he can lift the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt piece of money from the ground; he can untie knots; he can turn keys, puſh back bolts, or looſen ſtraps from buckles; and with this he can gratify his ſenſe of ſmelling (which there is reaſon to believe to be very exquiſite) by ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering flowers, and conveying them to his noſe, which, as well as his finger, compoſes a part of his trunk. The orange tree, in whoſe
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:030190_0225_0FE507B27AD12CB8"/>
flowers he delights, both for their taſte and ſmell, is an object of his moſt eager purſuit.</p>
            <p>The Elephant, when old, ſuffers great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience from the increaſing ſize of his large teeth or tuſks; to remedy this evil, his natural ſagacity prompts him to make two holes in a tree, if wild, or if tamed, in a wall, to ſupport them, and prevent the vaſt fatigue which his neck endures from their weight. As great part of his ſkin is tender and delicate, he ſuffers much from the bites and ſtings of flies. To prevent this inconvenience, he puts in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice all the means which his peculiar good ſenſe ſuggeſts: if he cannot keep the inſects away by bruſhing them off with branches of trees and whiſps of ſtraw, he then wets all the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed parts of his body, and gathering duſt with his trunk, ſpreads it carefully over each un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded place.</p>
            <p>The height of the creature in his natural ſtate is generally between ten and fourteen feet; but in captivity his growth is conſiderably checked.</p>
            <p>He is nice in many particulars, abhors bad ſmells, and, probably on that account, dreads the ſight, or even the cry of a hog. In eating, let him be ever ſo hungry, he will faſt until he has nicely examined his victuals, and ſeparated from them every particle of dirt, duſt, or other uncleanlineſs.</p>
            <p>Both ancient and modern writers dwell with peculiar pleaſure on the innumerable inſtances of inſtinct, or rather ſomewhat which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches very nearly to reaſon, in this noble animal; but of theſe we ſhall ſelect a few of the beſt atteſted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="unknown:030190_0226_0FE507B412471B90"/>
An Elephant had been provoked by ill uſage to kill his conductor.—The widow, who had been a witneſs to the horrid ſcene, ruſhed with her two infant children to the enraged animal.—<q>Here, ſaid ſhe, ſince you have ſlain my huſband, take my life too, and complete your bloody buſineſs by deſtroying theſe poor babes!</q> The beaſt, apparently hurt at his own exceſs of paſſion, loſt at once his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and taking the eldeſt of the children in his trunk, adopted him, as it were for his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and would never ſuffer any other perſon to mount his neck.</p>
            <p>If the Elephant is revengeful when ill treated, he is truly grateful to thoſe who uſe him kindly. A ſoldier in the Eaſt Indies had been accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he received his pay, to treat one of theſe ſenſible animals with arrack; one day, having himſelf partaken too largely of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> liquor, he eſcaped from a detachment who had been ordered to convey him to priſon, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhelter beneath the creature whom he had obliged, he fell faſt aſleep. His purſuers find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Elephant had taken him under his protection, left him, and he, when he awoke, ſober, and frightened at his ſituation, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoled by the careſſes of the good-natured ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, who ſeemed ſenſible of the terrours which his benefactor felt, and willing to remove them. An Elephant, in a battle fought not many years ago, having been driven to diſtraction by the pain of his wounds, ran about the field making the moſt hideous cries. A wounded ſoldier of his own party lay juſt in his way and naturally expected inſtant deſtruction. But the
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:030190_0227_0FE507B59CD6FAF8"/>
poor tortured animal, conſcious that he owed none of his pain to the ſoldier, took him ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly up with his trunk, and, having placed him out of the common path, continued his route. This anecdote points out the ſpecies of excellent reaſoning in the Elephant, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents him from being provoked, even by the moſt accute pain, to hurt ſuch as have not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured him: but he muſt not be wantonly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted; and even the moſt trifling affront may expoſe the giver to a fatal recompence. An Elephant which was kept at Verſailles<note n="*" place="bottom">A palace about ten miles from Paris, where the Kings of France uſed to have a collection of curious beaſts, birds, &amp;c. &amp;c.</note> not many years paſt, appeared to know when he was mocked by any perſon, and ſeldom failed to revenge the inſult. A man deceived him, by pretending to throw eatables into his mouth. The animal took his opportunity to knock him down with his trunk, and treated him ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely that he ſcarcely eſcaped with life. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time a painter, in order to draw him with his trunk elevated, employed his ſervant to throw, or pretend to throw, fruit into the Elephant's mouth; the deceitful part of this order was reſented by the creature with ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſagacity, that inſtead of revenging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the ſervant, (who appears to have been within his reach,) he ſquirted ſuch a quantity of water from his trunk at the maſter, (whom he judiciouſly diſcerned to be the contriver of his mortification,) that it utterly ruined the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per on which his work was going forward.</p>
            <p>It is recorded, and univerſally credited, of an Elephant, that as he was paſſing along a
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:030190_0228_0FE507C1E59765D8"/>
ſtreet in the city of Delhi, he thruſt his trunk in at the window of a room where a tailor ſate employed on a rich habit.—This man, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at being interrupted in his work, cauſed the animal to withdraw in great haſte, by pricking him with a needle; provoked at this treatment, the Elephant, who knew that he ſhould paſs by the ſame ſtreet again the next day, it being the uſual road to his watering place, took care to be prepared for his enemy, by laying in a ſtore of dirty water; this he emptied from his trunk at the ſame window, and completed his revenge, by thoroughly ſpoiling the ſilk on which the tailor was at work.</p>
            <p>Accounts hardly credible, although perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well atteſted, are told of the Elephant's ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility to reproach. One in particular, having been upbraided by his keeper, as a poor indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent creature, for having failed in an effort to ſet afloat a veſſel which lay aſhore, an attempt which was really beyond his ſtrength, was ſo much hurt by the charge, that he made a new trial, ſucceeded in it, but fell inſtantly dead, from the damage which he had received in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the exertion.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid before, that mild as the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant naturally is, he is not to be trifled with. One of theſe animals having, with great ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, carried the iron veſſel in which he uſually drank, to the ſmith's ſhop where it uſed to be repaired; the workman mended it but by halves; the Elephant carried it back, and was ſeverely reproached by his maſter; who made him comprehend, by ſhowing him how the
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:030190_0229_0FE507C379600CA0"/>
water ran out of the veſſel, that it needed a farther repair. The animal, as much hurt as if <hi>he</hi> had been accountable for the workman's neglect, ſnatching the veſſel out of the owner's hand, half full of water as it was, carried it in haſte to the ſhop; and as ſoon as the perſon who had done his work ſo ill appeared, the Elephant diſcharged the water in his face, as a puniſhment for his miſbehaviour.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, Mr. Buffon has ſupplied what has been ſaid of the Elephant; what follows, is chiefly taken from Sparman's account of the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
            <p>A female Elephant loſt her young one. It ſeems, that it had fallen into the hands of a party of the native Hottentots, who had killed and devoured it. The mother, the next night, having ſome how (probably by the ſcent) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the place of its death, attacked the kraal or village in the dark, and utterly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, by beating down all the huts, and tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all the plantations to pieces. And here it may be properly remarked, that the Hotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tots eagerly ſeek the fleſh of the Elephant to eat it; which is not the caſe with any other Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican or Aſiatic people, that we read of.</p>
            <p>In the country round the Cape, the Elephant is purſued, not to be tamed, but to be ſlain for the ſake of the ivory which his teeth afford. In this chace, the danger to the hunter is great; but the hopes of a large profit (ſometimes as much as 300 gilders, or about twenty-ſix pounds, by a ſingle Elephant) make him cloſe his eyes to all perils. He muſt be very atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to approach the animal on the ſide whence
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:030190_0230_0FE507C507002510"/>
the wind blows; for ſhould he be diſcerned by his piercing ſcent, the Elephant ruſhes on him; nor can any thing ſave him, except a ſteep hill or wood, either of which circumſtances incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the beaſt, and ſave the ſportſman. The bullet which is deſtined to deſtroy this immenſe creature, muſt be made of a proportionable mixture of tin and lead; the piece from whence it is diſcharged, is generally one of thoſe muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets which were in uſe about one hundred and eighty years ago, ſo ſtrong and heavy, as to require a reſt to ſupport it when levelled. And yet, when theſe enormous pieces are deeply loaded, and ſupplied with proper balls, an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant has been known to receive eight wounds in his body, before he was deprived of life.</p>

            <head>THE LION.</head>
            <p>THE Lion, though inferior in ſize to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other animals which inhabit the ſame coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries with himſelf, is ſo ſuperior in the united qualities of ſtrength, addreſs, and courage, as to have obtained the higheſt rank amongſt the brute creation. Even the cumbrous Elephant, and the robuſt Buffalo, are conquered by this lordly beaſt, who proudly ſubdues and preys upon all, but is himſelf the prey of none. Nor is his courage leſs remarkable than his ſtrength. The fierce Lion, who has been uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, and is ignorant of the ſuperior power of man, will ſometimes ruſh upon a caravan which
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:030190_0231_0FE507C86A25EAC0"/>
is travelling through the deſerts; and ſuch is his contempt of danger, that when he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed, he does not turn his back and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to eſcape, but retreats ſighting, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending himſelf againſt the attacks of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The largeſt Lions are about eight or nine feet in length, and three or four feet in height: their colour is yellow on the back, and a duſky white on the ſides and belly. The male Lion is adorned with a large flowing mane, which grows larger as he advances in years; but the female is without this ornament, and is about one-fourth leſs in ſize. In general the Lioneſs is much more docile and gentle than the Lion; but when ſhe has young, ſhe becomes ſtill fiercer than he, and will attack a number of armed men in defence of her whelps. Her care to ſecure them from diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is ſhown before their birth; ſhe retires to the leaſt frequented places, and when they are brought forth, ſhe is ſo careful to preſerve them, that when ſhe leaves them to procure food, ſhe carefully bruſhes away the marks of her feet with her tail, that her young may not be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the prints of her ſteps. The Lion is an inhabitant of warm climates, and is never found in the frozen regions of the North. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the ſtrength and fierceneſs of this terrible animal appear to be greatly increaſed by the heat of the climate he inhabits; and there is a remarkable difference between the ferocity of thoſe Lions which breathe the temperate air of lofty mountains and of thoſe which dwell in the ſandy and ſcorching plains. The American Lions, which are natives of a milder climate, have neither the fierceneſs, the ſtrength, nor
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:030190_0232_0FE507D1444DDE20"/>
the courage of thoſe born under the fervid rays of an Indian or African ſun; nor are they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with a mane. Indeed, their differing in ſo many reſpects has made ſeveral Naturaliſts very doubtful whether or not they were of the true Lion ſpecies.</p>
            <p>Though the Lion is naturally an inhabitant of hot countries, he can ſubſiſt a long time in more temperate climates. Several have lived during many years in Europe, and ſome have brought forth young, and attained to a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable age, in Britain. The time which has been ſuppoſed the uſual term of their lives is between twenty and twenty-five years. Their numbers have been greatly leſſened by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the human ſpecies, and the invention of fire-arms; and though many ſtill inhabit the ſouthern parts of Africa and Aſia, and are very fierce and dreadful, yet they are no longer found in very large numbers. Thoſe Lions which dwell near the villages of India or Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary, have ſo often experienced the ſuperior powers of man, that they have loſt much of their native fierceneſs, and, if forced by hunger or provoked by the attacks of men, they attempt to aſſault them, they approach with great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſigns of fear. It is however aſſerted, that if this fierce beaſt has conquered, and has once taſted human fleſh, he will never after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards prey with equal pleaſure upon any other animal.</p>
            <p>When the Lion prepares to attack his prey, he generally makes uſe of ſtratagem to enſure his ſucceſs He lies in wait near the ſprings where the animals go to drink, couched upon
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:030190_0233_0FE507D2CF385CC0"/>
his belly, darts upon them as they paſs, and ſeldom miſſes his aim, though he frequently makes a leap twelve or fifteen feet in length. As he neither hears nor ſees very well, though he has the faculty of ſeeing in the night, he is known to employ great watchfulneſs to procure his prey; and is obliged to keep at a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable diſtance from the animal he means to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, who would, if he came nearer, ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover him by his ſtrong ſcent. Springs and fountains are very agreeable to him, not only on account of their being frequented by other animals, but alſo from the great thirſtineſs of the Lion; for though he is able to ſupport great hunger, he ſuffers much from thirſt. When he attacks the Buffalo, he ruſhes upon him unſeen, faſtens his two fore paws upon his mouth and noſtrils, and does not reſign his hold till the animal is quite ſtrangled; he then ſometimes tears out the entrails that he may remove the body with more eaſe, and drags it to a retreat, where he may enjoy his feaſt in ſecurity.</p>
            <p>All animals appear to have a natural dread of the Lion, and travellers have frequently been acquainted with their approach by the uneaſineſs of their cattle. The oxen and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſigh deeply, and ſhow every appearance of terrour, and the dogs creep cloſe to the feet of their maſters, and are afraid even to bark. At the ſound of his terrible voice the affrighted animals run wildly about to avoid him; but as he lays his mouth to the ground when he utters his deep continued roars, the ſound is ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, that they know not whence it proceeds,
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:030190_0234_0FE507D45A83AC88"/>
and they frequently advance to the very ſpot where he ſtands ready to devour them. But terrible as the Lion is to every other animal, he is ſo inferior to man, that he is not only fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently taken in toils which are formed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him, but is even hunted for amuſement. The inhabitants of the ſouthern parts of Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, mounted on horſeback, frequently purſue and kill him, and they eſteem his fleſh both pleaſant and nouriſhing. His ſkin, which in ſome countries has been uſed as a royal mantle, is however regarded as very inferior in real uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to the hide of an Ox.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of the Cape of Good Hope, who are much infeſted by Lions, which devour their flocks, make uſe of many artifices to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them. In travelling in the night, they are obliged to be pretty conſtantly upon their guard againſt this fierce animal, though he ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom attacks them in the day, except he is very hungry, or greatly provoked. A Hottentot, who was travelling to a conſiderable diſtance, obſerved that he was followed by one of theſe formidable animals, which kept ſeveral yards behind him, but advanced with exactly the ſame ſpeed. Senſible of the cunning of the Lion, who ſeldom attacks his prey openly, the traveller concluded that he only waited for the approach of darkneſs to ruſh upon him; and as he was without weapons, and at a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from any habitation, he was in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt danger of being torn in pieces by his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuer. His knowledge of the manners of the animal, and his own ingenuity, furniſhed him, however, with the means to eſcape. He care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:030190_0235_0FE507D7E2B98AA8"/>
ſought for ſome rocky place, which was level at the top, and had a deep precipice on one ſide; and ſeating himſelf on the brink, he prepared for the part he was to act to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from deſtruction, while his enemy lay couched upon the ground, and ſteadily obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. As ſoon as it became duſk, the Hottentot, gently ſliding forwards, let himſelf down upon a ſmall part of the rock which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected juſt below him, and which was juſt large enough to ſupport him; but in order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Lion, he raiſed his ſtick, upon which he had placed his hat and cloak, and made a gentle motion with it juſt above his head, at a ſmall diſtance from the edge of the mountain. This ſtratagem had the deſired ſucceſs. The Lion crept gently towards the ſtick, which he miſtook for the man, and then bounded upon it, with ſo exact an aim as to fall down the precipice cloſe to the ſpot where the Hottentot had placed the ſnare.</p>
            <p>There are few diſpoſitions ſo ſavage that they may not be tamed by kindneſs, and even the ferocious Lion has afforded the ſtrongeſt proofs of attachment and gratitude for the benefits he has received. The celebrated Earl of Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, when a boy, was preſented with a young Lion, which he greatly delighted to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs and to feed; and the animal became ſo tame as to ſuffer his lordſhip to play with him, with the familiarity of a brother. They grew up together, and their intimacy had continued ſeveral years, when the Earl was appointed by Queen Ann to the command of her army in Spain. His promotion did not, however, make
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:030190_0236_0FE507E1D5B9AD10"/>
him forgetful of his old friend the Lion; he gave ſtrict orders to his houſekeeper to take care of his playfellow. The animal ſhowed great concern at the abſence of his lordſhip, ſenſibly pined for his loſs, and refuſed his food; and the Earl, in order to preſerve his life, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to be preſented to her Majeſty, in hopes that the ſociety of the other animals in the Tower would make him forget his old friend. A long time paſſed before the return of the Earl from Spain, who brought over with him a Spaniſh officer whom he had taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. His humanity made him deſirous of making the captivity of the Spaniard as eaſy as poſſible; and in hopes of amuſing him, he took him to view whatever was curious, in or near London, and amongſt other places they viſited the Tower. Here the Earl was received by a roar of joy from his old companion, who immediately knew him, and ſhowed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt tranſports at the return of his benefactor; nor did he ſuffer him to depart, till, in the exceſs of his rapture, he had deprived his lordſhip of nearly the whole of his coat, though he very carefully avoided injuring his perſon.</p>

            <head>OF THE TWO-HORNED RHINOCEROS.</head>
            <p>THIS animal is ſound in Africa, chiefly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Cape of Good Hope, and is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the common or one-horned Rhinoceros, as well as from all other beaſts, by having two horns upon its noſe, the larger of which ſtands foremoſt towards the muzzle or ſnout of the animal, the ſhorter behind it, and higher up towards the forehead. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt horn grows almoſt to the length of two feet, and ſeven or eight inches thick at the bottom; the hindmoſt ſometimes meaſures ſo long as ſixteen inches, and proportionably thick. They are of a conical ſhape, with the tips inclined ſomewhat backwards, but their ſize does not always appear to be in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the body. This ſpecies of Rhinoce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros is endued with prodigious ſtrength, and, though little inferiour in ſize to the Elephant, and ſomewhat reſembling it in its enormous unwieldy make, runs with aſtoniſhing ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It harbours amongſt cloſe thickets and buſhy copſes, from whence it comes forth in the cool of the evening, to graze for the night. Its food conſiſts of plants and roots, with the
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:030190_0238_0FE507E4EB7C6A70"/>
tops of ſhrubs, and ſmall branches of trees. The roots it is ſuppoſed to dig up with the ſmalleſt of its horns, as this, eſpecially in the older animals, is moſt commonly obſerved to be worn away in different parts, which is never the caſe in the foremoſt and larger one. It is natural to ſuppoſe that this latter is the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive weapon of the animal, and is therefore never uſed in the ſervile employment of digging for its food, at which time it is turned on one ſide, out of the way; for theſe horns are ſaid to be ſo looſe and moveable, that when the Rhinoceros walks careleſsly along, one may ſee its horns dangle about, and hear them claſh and clatter againſt each other. The ſhrubs and plants, which alſo compoſe part of its food, it clips off with its lips, not having any fore teeth for that purpoſe, Indeed it has little room for them, as the mouth goes off ſo ſharp at the fore part (ſomething like that of a Tortoiſe) that it is only an inch and a half broad. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it has no occaſion for any teeth there, the ſkin which forms the lips being of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme hardneſs, that it can perform the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of teeth very well, and that with ſo much the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er eaſe, as the under jaw goes within the upper.</p>
            <p>The tongue is perfectly ſoft, which directly contradicts the common notion that the Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noceros kills by licking with his tongue.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the formidable bulk and amazing ſtrength of this animal, which has been known to run up to a waggon and carry it to a conſiderable diſtance on its ſnout and horns, the Hottentots and the Dutch farmers <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Good Hope, frequently attack and overpower it. For the purpoſe of ſhooting it they uſe balls made of lead and tin mixt, and having found out its retirement, they approach it on the ſide oppoſite to that from which the wind blows. This precaution is abſolutely neceſſary on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the very acute ſmell and hearing with which the animal is endued. At the leaſt noiſe more than uſual, it takes the alarm, and erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its ears, ſtands clapping with them and liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening; and if the hunter be ſo imprudent as to get to the windward of it, even at a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it ſeldom fails directly to follow him by the ſcent and attack him with the greateſt fury. Being therefore pretty ſecure on the ſide of the wind, the Rhinoceros has the ſagacity in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to chooſe, by way of entrenchment, a buſh very thick, and high on that ſide from whence it has no ſcent. If wounded it ruſhes out from the thickets into the plain, when the boldeſt ſportſmen prudently conſult their ſafety by flight. It ſoon, however, turns aſide, and if there be no copſe convenient for its eſcape, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

With a gentle riſe and fall of the neck it keeps on an even ſteady courſe, a kind of pacing, which nevertheleſs gets over a great deal of ground: but this pace, on hearing a few ſhots fired after it, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

ſportſman would inevitably be loſt, who ſhould happen to become the object of its purſuit, if he had not art enough to get out of the ſight and ſcent of it by ſhifting and dodging occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally. In this particular the Rhinoceros is ſaid to reſemble the Elephant, that without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying or ſtopping in the leaſt, it will run to the diſtance of many leagues from the place where it has been cloſely hunted, or in any other way moleſted.</p>
            <p>The two-horned Rhinoceros ſleeps in a different poſture from the Elephant; it lies down on the ground on one ſide, and withal is ſaid to ſleep ſo ſound, that the Hottentots and Dutch coloniſts frequently ſteal upon it while in that ſituation, and ſhoot it; it differs very much in this reſpect from the common or one-horned Rhinoceros, which is deſcribed as by no means a ſleepy animal. If it happens not to die immediately of its wounds, the Hottentot hunters will nevertheleſs follow the traces of it for one or more days, till it drops down with weakneſs and fatigue. In general, however, they poiſon one or two of their darts <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> they attack it, in which caſe they have no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to wait ſo many days as they otherwiſe would before their prey falls into their hands.</p>
            <p>Fortunately for thoſe who attack the Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noceros, with all its keenneſs of ſmell and hearing, it labours under the diſadvantage of being extremely near-ſighted. In effect, its eyes are very ſmall and ſunk into its head, which is perhaps the reaſon <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

of fifty or ſixty yards upon the open plain, unleſs directed by its ſcent or hearing to fix upon the object. Whenever therefore it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to receive a wound without being able to diſcover from what hand it proceeds, this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance ſeems to provoke it to a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of fury. Not knowing where to wreak its vengeance, it ſwings the fore part of its body violently from one ſide to the other, and ſnuffs up with its noſtrils as if endeavouring to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the enemy by its ſmell. The noiſe which it makes with its noſe upon ſuch occaſions is particularly terrible to the horſes of thoſe who are in chace of it: for when wounded, it will ſnuff and blow ſo hard and ſo loud as to ſtartle them, and make them uneaſy, at the diſtance of ſome hundreds of yards. Indeed, inſtinct ſufficiently informs the horſe of its danger, when the Rhinoceros is nigh, not only by the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but by the ſmell alſo; for whenever the ſportſmen approach its retreat, which is always done againſt the wind, the horſes having the advantage of the breeze, are enabled to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their tremendous enemy ſo far off as forty or fifty yards by the ſmell: upon this they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſtop, and give evident proofs of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror by their unwillineſs to proceed any farther.</p>
            <p>This animal is of a greyiſh or aſh colour, but, which is very remarkable, ſeems to change its hue, and become almoſt black upon being hard hunted. This is owing probably to the duſt and dried mud that ſticks to its ſkin (as it is very fond <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>rolling and wallowing in the mire), and when moiſtened by ſweat, becomes much darker in colour. About the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

however, where the ſkin is not ſo thick as on the reſt of the body, and almoſt quite ſmooth, it is nearly the colour of a man's fleſh. On all other parts the ſurface of the ſkin is rough and knotty, and not much differing from that of an Elephant, but of a cloſer texture, and when it is dry, extremely hard. It has not, however, any of thoſe plaits and folds which are to be obſerved in the common deſcriptions and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures publiſhed of it, and which give it the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of being covered with a harneſs. The hide is an inch and a half thick on the back, and ſomewhat thicker on the ſides, though leſs compact there. It is, however, by no means impenetrable, as has been commonly ſuppoſed. Leaden balls indeed will ſooner be flattened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſkin than pierce it; but when they are hardened by a proper mixture of tin, the Rhinoceros may be killed by a ſingle ſhot. Nay, its hide, as well as that of the Elephant, is capable of being penetrated by javelins and darts. A Hottentot, at the diſtance of five or ſix paces, has been known to pierce through the hide of a Rhinoceros half a foot deep into its body. Some have alſo imagined it to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs no feeling in its ſkin; but, beſides what is mentioned of the common Rhinoceros, that it is capable of being tickled under the belly with a whiſp of ſtraw, the Two-horned Rhinoceros is fond (as was mentioned before) of wallowing in the mire like a hog, which would hardly be the caſe were its hide abſolutely inſenſible; and indeed, when the thick hide of an Elephant is affected by the ſtinging of flies, we cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that of the Rhinoceros to be totally deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:030190_0243_0FE507F6C0133DC8"/>
of feeling. Its ſkin, though tough and cloſe in its texture, has, particularly about the groin, veſſels, blood, and juices, adapted for the nouriſhment of inſects; and in effect this animal is found to be infeſted in that part with a particular ſpecies of inſect; neither does the thickneſs of its hide hinder it from perſpiring. Laſtly, the Rhinoceros here deſcribed may be ſaid to be totally deſtitute of hair, though there are a few ſcattered dark briſtly hairs, about an inch long, on the edges of the ears, with a very few between and round about the horns, and at the tip of the tail. This part of the animal is about an inch thick, diminiſhing by degrees from the root to the tip, where it is flattened at the ſides; and on the edges, produced by this flatneſs, are to be ſeen ſome ſtrong ſtiff hairs, an inch or an inch and a half in length. Such of them as ſtand towards the creature's hard and rough body are viſibly worn down and ſtunted.</p>
            <p>Of the inward parts of this animal, it is ſufficient to obſerve, that its fleſh, when dreſt, taſte a good deal like pork, but much coarſer. Its brain are leſs than thoſe of a middle-ſized man; like the horſe, it has no gall; its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails alſo moſt reſemble thoſe of a horſe: ſo that this beaſt, notwithſtanding its being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with horns, does by no means belong to the claſs of thoſe which chew the cud, but rather of thoſe whoſe fat is of a ſoft nature like lard, and not hard like tallow. The ſtomach, however, does not bear the leaſt reſemblance to that of a horſe, but rather to that of a man or hog; and the contents of it, when opened,
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:030190_0244_0FE50805E39F1848"/>
after the animal has been lately killed, are uſually without ſmell, and perfectly freſh and ſweet, conſiſting of roots and ſmall branches of trees chewed, ſome of them as big as the end of a man's finger; and of ſucculent plants, the whole diffuſing around a very ſtrong and not diſagreeable aromatic odour.</p>

            <head>OF THE HUMMING-BIRD.</head>
            <p>OF this charming little animal, there are ſix or ſeven varieties, from the ſize of a ſmall wren, down to that of an humble bee. An European could never have ſuppoſed a bird exiſting ſo very ſmall, and yet completely furniſhed out with a bill, feathers, wings, and inteſtines, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly reſembling thoſe of the largeſt kind. A bird not ſo big as the end of one's little finger, would probably be ſuppoſed but a creature of imagination, were it not ſeen in infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and as frequent as butterflies in a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's day, ſporting in the fields of America, from flower to flower, and extracting their ſweets with its little bill.</p>
            <p>The ſmalleſt humming-bird is about the ſize of an hazel-nut. The feathers on its wings and tail are black; but thoſe on its body and under its wings, are of a greeniſh brown, with a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> red caſt or gloſs, which no ſilk or velvet can imitate. It has a ſmall creſt on its head, green at the bottom, and as it were gilded at the top; and which ſparkles in the ſun like a little ſtar in the middle of its forehead. The bill is
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:030190_0245_0FE5080793529C08"/>
black, ſtraight, ſlender, and of the length of a ſmall pin. The largeſt humming-bird is near half as big as the common wren, and without a creſt on its head; but to make amends, it is covered, from the throat half way down the belly, with changeable crimſon-coloured fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which, in different lights, change to a variety of beautiful colours, much like an opal. The heads of both are ſmall, with very little round eyes as black as jet.</p>
            <p>It is inconceivable how much theſe add to the high finiſhing and beauty of a rich luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous weſtern landſcape. As ſoon as, the ſun is riſen, the humming-birds, of different kinds, are ſeen fluttering about the flowers, without ever lighting upon them Their wings are in ſuch rapid motion, that it is impoſſible to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern their colours, except by their glittering. They are never ſtill, but continually in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, viſiting flower after flower, and extracting its honey. For this purpoſe they are furniſhed with a forked tongue, that enters the cup of the flower, and extracts its nectared tribute. Upon this alone they ſubſiſt. The rapid mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their wings brings out a humming ſound, whence they have their name.</p>
            <p>The neſts of theſe birds are not leſs curious than the reſt: they are ſuſpended in the air, at the point of the twigs of an orange, a pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate, or a citron tree; ſometimes even in houſes, if they find a ſmall and convenient twig for the purpoſe. The female is the architect, while the male goes in queſt of materials; ſuch as cotton, file moſs, and the fibres of vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. The neſt is about the ſize of an men's
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:030190_0246_0FE508091D38B298"/>
egg cut in two. They lay two eggs at a time, and never more, about the ſize of ſmall peas, and as white as ſnow, with here and there a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſpeck. The time of incubation contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues twelves days; at the end of which the young ones appear, and are much about the ſize of a blue-bottle-fly.</p>
            <p>It is a doubt whether or not theſe birds have a continued note in ſinging. All travellers agree that, beſide the humming noiſe produced by their wings they have a little interrupted chirrup; but Labat aſſerts, that they have a moſt pleaſing melancholy melody in their voices, though ſmall and proportioned to the organs which produce it. It is very probable that, in different places, their notes are alſo different; and as there are ſome that continue torpid all the winter, there may likewiſe be ſome with agreeable voices, though the reſt may in general be ſilent.</p>

            <head>THE NIGHTINGALE.</head>
            <p>THE NIGHTINGALE is the moſt famous of the feathered tribe. It viſits England in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of April, and leaves it in Auguſt. It is found but in ſome of the ſouthern parts of that country, being totally unknown in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Ireland, or North Wales. They fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:030190_0247_0FE5080AA8BB3F00"/>
thick hedges and low coppices, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally keep in the middle of the buſh, ſo that they are rarely ſeen. They begin their ſong in the evening, and generally continue it for the whole night. For weeks together, if undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed, they ſit upon the ſame tree; and Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear rightly deſcribes the nightingale ſitting nightly in the ſame place.</p>
            <p>In the begining of May, the nightingale prepares to make its neſt, which is formed of the leaves of trees, ſtraw, and moſs. The neſt being very eagerly ſought after, is as cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecreted; ſo that but very few of them are found by the boys when they go upon theſe purſuits. It is built at the bottom of hedges, where the buſhes are thickeſt and beſt covered. While the female continues ſitting, the male at a good diſtance, but always within hearing, cheers the patient hen with his voice, and, by the ſhort interruption of his ſong, often gives her warning of approaching danger. She lays four or five eggs; of which but a part, in that cold climate, come to maturity.</p>
            <p>The delicacy, or rather the fame, of this bird's muſic, has induced many to abridge its liberty to ſecure its harmony. Its ſong, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in captivity is not ſo very alluring; and the tyranny of taking it from thoſe hedges where only it is moſt pleaſing, ſtill more depreciates its impriſoned efforts. Geſner aſſures us, that it is not only the moſt agreeable ſongſter in a cage, but that it is poſſeſſed of a moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faculty of talking. He tells the following ſtory in proof of his aſſertion, which he ſays was communicated to him by a friend. <q>Whilſt
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:030190_0248_0FE50817975680A8"/>
I was at Ratiſbone, ſays his correſpondent, I put up at an inn, the ſign of the Golden Crown, where my hoſt had three nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales. It happened at that time, being the ſpring of the year, when thoſe birds are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſing, that I was ſo afflicted with the ſtone, that I could ſleep but very little all night. It was uſual then about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night to hear the two nightingales jangling. and talking with each other, and plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itating men's diſcourſes. Beſides repeating the daily diſcourſe of the gueſts, they chant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out two ſtories. One of their ſtories was concerning the tapſter and his wiſe, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to follow him to the wars as he deſired her; for the huſband endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade his wife, as far as I underſtood by the buds, that he would leave his ſervice in that inn, and go to the wars in hopes of plunder. But ſhe refuſed to follow him, reſolving to ſtay either at Ratiſbone, or go to Nuremberg. There was a long and earneſt contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; and all this dialogue the birds repeated. The other ſtory was concerning the war which the emperor was then threatening againſt the proteſtants; which the birds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably heard from ſome of the generals that had conferences in the houſe. Theſe things did they repeat in the night after twelve o'clock, when there was a deep ſilence. But in the day time, for the moſt part, they were ſilent, and ſeemed to do nothing but meditate and revolve with themſelves upon what the gueſts conferred together as they ſat at table, or in their walks.</q>

               <pb n="244" facs="unknown:030190_0249_0FE4FE8AC523DF48"/>
Such is the ſagacity aſcribed to the nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale. But there is a little bird, rather celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for its affection to mankind than its ſinging, which however, in a Britiſh climate, has the ſweeteſt note of all others. The reader already perceives that I mean the RED-BREAST, the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known friend of man, that is found in every hedge, and makes it vocal. The note of other birds is louder, and their inflections more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious; but this bird's voice is ſoft, tender, and well ſupported; and the more to be valued as it is enjoyed the greateſt part of the winter. If the nightingale's ſong has been compared to the fiddle, the red-breaſt's voice has all the delicacy of the flute.</p>

the age of Caſſander and that of Eugene, each ſhared invariably in the ſtudies as well as the amuſements of the other two; or whether it was the natural bent of their diſpoſitions, I know not, but they were remarkable for bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards each other a degree of affection that is rarely to be found amongſt brothers in general. In their ſports they were inſeparable; the inequality of their number was never an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to their all partaking of the ſame paſtime, though it might originally have been intended but for two; and notwithſtanding there would now and then ariſe a trifling diſpute amongſt them concerning their play, all differences were uſually ſettled and reconciled before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the game, ſo that they never parted from each other in a pet; but, on the contrary, after they were tired of play, it was no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common thing to ſee them linked all three arm in arm, ſauntering up and down the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den walks, which were commonly the ſcene of their amuſements; and in that friendly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude communicating to each other their little fancies, diſcuſſing the remarkale ſtories that occurred in the courſe of their leſſons, or elſe laying their heads together to plan and ſtrike out ſome new mode of diverſion.</p>
            <p>Thus agreeing, and unanimous in all things, they entered with pleaſure upon the courſe of ſtudy laid down to them by Mr. Markham, their tutor. Mrs. Smithſon had never, while her ſons were under her care, made their leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons a painful or diſagreeable taſk; the novelty therefore of Mr. Markham's firſt examination, under whom they found that they were to learn
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:030190_0252_0FE4FE9A2921A9C0"/>
both Latin and Greek, ſo charmed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted them, that they all three jumped for joy when their Papa ſhowed them three Latin Grammars, which they were to begin the next day.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>Beſides, their ſatisfaction at not being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to leave their dear parents, nor to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from each other, might not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the alacrity they ſhowed on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. In effect the quickneſs of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſurprized and delighted Mr. Markham,
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:030190_0253_0FE4FEA2A7825970"/>
their preſent tutor, as well as their former one, that is their Mama, to whom they would run every day in raptures of joy to communicate the contents of their ſeveral leſſons.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have ſeen Eugene, Richard and Caſſander, perfectly alike and equal in all things; it is neceſſary now to ſhow in what reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects they were unlike, and how the particular character and diſpoſition of each, though lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to actions extremely different from what the others would purſue, yet always uniformly concurred in the exertion of that amiable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, brotherly love.</p>
            <p>Eugene, therefore, with much generoſity and ſomething of fire in his compoſition, was at the ſame time a little arch, or what is called waggiſh. His pranks in general were the moſt innocent in the world, it is true, and he could ſay at leaſt, that he never meant to hurt: if, however, it would ſometimes happen, which after all was ſeldom the caſe, that any of his little jokes coſt either of his brothers a tear; that tear, it was eaſy to be ſeen, gave Eugene infinitely more pain than any he himſelf ſhed: but the open frankneſs and ardent good-nature, with which he would conſole his weeping bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſeldom failed to dry it up in a moment. He would never juſtify his own miſtakes or his awkwardneſs; and thus he ſeldom felt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of his companions, becauſe they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways found him ready to ſubmit to them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly, and, whenever it ſo happened, to own himſelf in the fault.</p>
            <p>Richard, on the other hand, was all ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: he had not the leaſt ſhadow of deſign in
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:030190_0254_0FE4FEA4A36FC700"/>
him; and were it not for the extraordinary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion that he ſhowed in his learning, in which he outſtripped both his brothers, he might be ſaid not to have a thought of his own. Thus Richard, though as cheerful as the day, ſeldom laughed unleſs Eugene or Caſſander led the joke. He never propoſed a new ſort of play, or invented a freſh plaything, but always was ready, with the greateſt good humour, to join in the one and admire the other, if offered to his attention by either of his brothers. He might even be ſaid to have no wants or likings of his own, but as they put him in mind of them. If Eugene ſaid to the maid, "Molly, I want to go to bed;" Richard would add, "ſo do I too." If Caſſander ſaid, "Mama, pray give me a piece of bread and butter," Richard, it preſent, would commonly join, "Aye, and me too." And this diſpoſition of Richard was the happieſt in the world; for preſerving the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Three Brothers; ſince, whatever advantage or ſuperiority he might have in his learning, all his amuſements, all the pleaſure that he enjoyed from ſociety, depended wholly on Eugene and Caſſander.</p>
            <p>This laſt was neither ſo volatile as his elder brother, nor ſo ſimple as Richard: he had ſomething grave even in his countenance, and though youngeſt of the three, was allowed to be much the moſt prudent; by which means he balanced, as it were, the oppoſite defects of his brothers, and frequently would act as their adviſer and cenſor, by reproving Eugene for his too great vivacity, which led him ſo often into ſcrapes, and Richard for his thoughtleſs abſence and extreme credulity. But though
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:030190_0255_0FE4FDBB8579E6B8"/>
he ſometimes took this freedom, it was always with the greateſt tenderneſs, being accuſtomed from his infancy to treat his elders with reſpect, particularly his brothers. Indeed a reſpect for their elders and ſuperiors Mrs. Smithſon took early care to inculcate on the minds of all her children. Richard was commanded, to yield in every thing to Eugene, and Caſſander to Richard; and all three to behave with proper deference to thoſe who were more advanced in life than themſelves. This injunction had a good effect more ways than one: it prevented any childiſh conteſts for the preference, as each knew and was contented with his own rank, and always waited his proper turn. Beſides, it made them behave with good manners to ſtrangers, let their condition in life be what it will; nor was any one of them ever known to ſpeak or act with petulance even to a beggar.</p>
            <p>After remaining a competent time under the inſtruction of Mr. Markham, it was their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's pleaſure that they ſhould all three enter the Univerſity together, and purſue their ſtudies there, in order to qualify themſelves for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of the learned profeſſions they might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards chooſe. This circumſtance gave them infinite pleaſure. The love that they bore to each other while children, was now ripening into a ſteady, ardent friendſhip, which no time could alter or diminiſh; and they ſaw before them a proſpect of being happy in each other's ſociety during the whole courſe of their lives. But human events are uncertain, and the ſhades of misfortune often intervene unexpectedly to chequer the moſt equal and placid ſunſhine of
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:030190_0256_0FE4FEA94EB7D668"/>
proſperity. Mr. Smithſon was ſtill in trade, and therefore liable to accidents and croſſes which merchants frequently experience. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, in the beginning of the war, that two ſhips, containing property of his to a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable amount, uninſured, were taken by the enemy. The deficiency produced in his capital by this misfortune, joined to ſeveral other ſmaller loſſes, obliged Mr. Smithſon to become a bankrupt; after which, conceiving a diſtaſte to his native place, he determined to take a voyage to the Weſt Indies, in order to look after an eſtate in land which had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed him as a legacy by ſome diſtant rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſince the time of his failure. At his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, not judging it expedient to take his wife along with him, he left her a ſmall ſum of ready money, but promiſed to ſend over remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances whenever the property, of which he went to take poſſeſſion, could be turned to any account.</p>
            <p>Our Three Brothers were inconſolable at parting with their father: this was the firſt time in their lives that they might be ſaid to feel the grief of abſence from their beloved parents; for while at College they could hardly be called abſent from home, as they converſed weekly, nay almoſt daily, by letters, either with Mr. or Mrs. Smithſon. But their ſorrow was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably increaſed, when, after two years had elapſed without any tidings from their father, they received a melancholy epiſtle from Mrs. Smithſon, informing them of her utter inability to maintain them any longer at College, and requeſting their immediate return, in order to
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:030190_0257_0FE4FEA63353CD10"/>
conſult how they ſhould diſpoſe of themſelves for their future ſettlement in life.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>During the laſt two years that they had ſpent at the Univerſity, nothing but the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt economy, on the part of the Brothers, as well as that of their indulgent parent, could have enabled them to ſubſiſt; yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the general diſſipation of the place, their temperance and frugality did not hinder them from ſupporting an amiable character, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing highly eſteemed by all who knew them. They were remarked for an obliging, affable demeanour, an unexceptionable attention to their College duties, but particularly for the ſtrict intimacy and happy degree of unanimity which they always appeared to maintain. They were indeed diſtinguiſhed by the title of the <hi>Three Brothers;</hi> and the wits of the place ſpoke of them as an exception to that remark of the poet
<q>
                  <l>Friendſhip, like love, is but a name,</l>
                  <l>Unleſs to one you ſtint the flame,</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="253" facs="unknown:030190_0258_0FE4FDB39FB0B390"/>
However, there was a conſiderable difference in their diſpoſitions, which, without the leaſt impairing their affection, grew every day more and more conſpicuous. Eugene was now am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, enterpriſing, and changeable: his parts were rather brilliant than ſolid. Caſſander, on the contrary, was ſteady in his opinions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, which he built on the ſoundeſt and moſt mature reflexion: he appeared more ſlow in apprehending the difficulties of ſcience than his elder brother; but, in return, his memory was more faithful and retentive, and whatever knowledge he once made his own was ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at his command; for, as Mr. Pope elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerves,
<q>
                  <l>Where beams of warm imagination play,</l>
                  <l>The memory's ſoft figures melt away</l>
               </q>
Richard was a ſort of <hi>medium</hi> between theſe oppoſites: with ſomething of Fugene's viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and the ſteadineſs of Caſſander, he had an ardent and inſatiable thirſt of knowledge; in effect, he had recommended himſelf ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to his ſuperiors, by the extent and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of his attainments, that he was at this very time of Mrs. Smithſon's writing for him and his brothers, pointed out to a nobleman, equally reſpectable for his rank and principles, as a proper perſon to be private tutor to his Lordſhip's two ſons, who were lately entered at the Univerſity.</p>
            <p>At their return, therefore, upon the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of their mother, when ſhe laid before them the melancholy ſtate of their affairs, the diſappointment of their expectations, and, to
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:030190_0259_0FE4FEB2CABDF060"/>
crown all, the dreadful apprehenſions that ſhe entertained of the loſs of her huſband, either at ſea or by the caſualties of war; concluding with the tendereſt advice to them, to unite their efforts towards the re-eſtabliſhing of their circumſtances by a ſteady courſe of induſtry in whatever profeſſions they might adopt: upon this occaſion it was that the advantages of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior application and a more rapid progreſs in learning appeared conſpicuous. While Eugene and Caſſander endeavour to comfort Mrs. Smithſon by the ſtrongeſt aſſurances of their future diligence and the exertion of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry in ſome line or other that might afford themſelves and her a decent maintenance, Richard had the happineſs of being able to make his mother and brothers the immediate tender of a ſmall competency from the ſalary which his noble patron was to allow him, who only waited for his anſwer to inveſt him with the care of his children's education. This proſpect was a ſeaſonable relief to Mrs. Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from the deſpondency into which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent gloom of her affairs had thrown her. It is true, the iron hand of want had not as yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to pinch her and her children, but the near approach of that unwelcome viſitor (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a reſource as Richard now ſuggeſted), was ſufficient to fill her mind with the moſt melancholy ideas and diſmal preſages of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Now therefore at length, by the irreſiſtible decree of neceſſity, were our Three Brothers obliged to part, and take different walks on the vaſt theatre of life. Richard, returning to the
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:030190_0260_0FE4FEB45F82C5C0"/>
Univerſity, attached himſelf with ſo much ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the education of his noble pupils, and to his own improvement, that, beſides being able for the preſent to contribute to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of his mother, and thoſe whom he held moſt dear next to her, he had the proſpect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him of obtaining an ample ſettlement in the church, through the intereſt of his munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent patron, whoſe favour he enjoyed in as full a meaſure as his numerous good qualities enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled him to it. Eugene, having procured re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations to a merchant in London, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired thither, and, applying himſelf ſteadily to buſineſs, in the courſe of four years gave ſuch proofs of his integrity and other good qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that he was taken by the merchant into partnerſhip. Caſſander, in the mean time, fearing to become a burthen on the moderate penſion that Richard allowed his mother, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the offer of a Newcaſtle trader, who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing formerly been an intimate friend of Mr. Smithſon's agreed to take Caſſander a voyage to the Eaſt country upon trial. Caſſander was ſtill but young, being no more than ſixteen at the time of his entering upon a ſea life, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his voyage of trial he prudently made it his choice, in preference to waiting for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain chance of ſome more brilliant eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In effect, what with the advantage of an excellent education, a patient and humane diſpoſition, and the uncommon character (for a ſeaman) of being remarkably ſober and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, he in a very few years ſo improved himſelf in the knowledge of trade and navigation, that he was appointed mate of a veſſel trading to
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:030190_0261_0FE4FEB5EC193328"/>
Ruſſia, the owners of which were ſo well pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his activity and good conduct, that they were determined, notwithſtanding his youth, to ſend him out maſter of one of their ſhips, the firſt opportunity that offered.</p>
            <p>Thus, for ſome years after the ſeparation of the Three Brothers, fortune ſeemed to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe the ſevere loſs that they had felt in the perſon of their father, concerning whom, all this time, notwithſtanding every poſſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, not the ſmalleſt intelligence had been received. But now, alas! once more, ſorrow and adverſity came hand in hand to diſquiet the feeling hearts of our three youths, by an hour of trial ſuch as they had never yet experienced. The news of their mother's death was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere prelude to their misfortunes. Richard had ſcarcely recovered the ſhock of this, when the death of his patron totally diſſipated all the flattering hopes that he had formed of fortune and preferment in the church, in which he had already taken orders. Eugene, and his partner had for ſome time felt their affairs in a critical condition; but this did not hinder him from exerting his native generoſity in the ſervice of an ancient friend. Indeed, the voice of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and gratitude always met with a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hearing from Eugene, let their ſummons be ever ſo preſſing and importunate. His old tutor, Mr. Markham, under whom he and his brothers had ſpent ſome of the happieſt years of their life, was at this time in London. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled by ſickneſs and infirmity, advancing faſt towards helpleſs old age, and ſorely galled by poverty and the neglect of the world, he was
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:030190_0262_0FE5071BE76F3AE8"/>
almoſt without a friend. In this criſis, chance threw his generous pupil in his way, who am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſupplied the place of one to him. Beſides
<figure/>
furniſhing him with the means of ſupplying his preſent neceſſities; Eugene, and by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion his partner, became ſecurity for the payment of a very conſiderable debt, which was on the point of conſigning Mr. Markham to a gaol, where he might probably have paſſed the remainder of his life. But how ill did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune requite Eugene for this friendly action! Mr. Markham died in leſs than three months after, when of courſe the debt devolved upon thoſe who had given ſecurity for him. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the heels of this misfortune follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another. The affairs of Eugene's partnerſhip growing deſperate, they were obliged to declare themſelves bankrupt, and this very kindneſs which he ſhowed Mr. Markham, was reckoned
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:030190_0263_0FE5071DF6F1E718"/>
among the misfortunes that contributed to his ruin. The ſhock that Eugene's ſpirits ſuffered upon this occaſion, as he found himſelf now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to fulfil engagements which he looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as ſacred, drove him from one act of raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deſpair to another; till in the end, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to extremity of want, in an obſcure coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try place, he madly and precipitately threw himſelf among a company of travelling players, and, to crown all, in this unpromiſing ſtate of life, being barely able to ſubſiſt himſelf, he had the deſperate imprudence to marry. It ſeems he had formed a ſlight acquaintance with a young lady (the daughter of a clergyman), who was ſo ſtruck with his figure and accompliſhments, that ſhe yielded to his ſolicitations to be united with him in the ties of clandeſtine wedlock; thereby utterly forfeiting all her expectations of fortune, together with the friendſhip of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of her relations. The conſequence of this unadviſed ſtep, which brought poverty and her train into Eugene's habitation in ſhapes unknown before, he bore with as much forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and philoſophy as uſually falls to the ſhare of five and twenty, that is, with very little if any at all. Some time before this, Caſſander who had made two or three voyages for his north-country owners, was invited to London by his brother and his partner, to take the command of one of the large ſhips in which they were principal proprietors. Overjoyed at this invitation, which would give him an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, or rather indeed lay him under the neceſſity, of being frequently with his brother while on ſhore, he came to town with all ſpeed,
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:030190_0264_0FE5072073094EC0"/>
and was juſt time enough to be witneſs to the unfortunate failure of Eugene and his aſſociate in trade.</p>
            <p>Thus were the Three Brothers plunged into circumſtances of the moſt helpleſs diſtreſs, juſt at a time when they entertained hopes (appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently well founded) of fixing themſelves to their ſatisfaction for life in their reſpective pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions. Had any one of them been exempt from the preſſure of misfortune, the other two would have been ſure of partaking with him in the comforts that depend on a competency of wealth. But all three were equally reduced; and the only remnant of happineſs, that they could call their own, was the ſenſe of their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual affection, which ſtill continued unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, amidſt the moſt pinching trials of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and calamity. In this ſituation were the Smithſons, when an incident happened which put that affection to the proof, and brought forth inſtances of ſelf-denial and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity that well deſerve to be recorded. In the courſe of Eugene's wanderings as a country player, fortune conducted him to Graveſend where, as he was exhibiting before an audience, chiefly compoſed of ſeafaring people, the ſame fortune unaccountably led his father to become a ſpectator of his performance. In order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the ſudden appearance of Mr. Smithſon, it will be neceſſary to relate what befel him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his departure from England. The reader will remember that this gentleman had ſet ſail for the Weſt-Indies, in order to take poſſeſſion of an eſtate in one of the iſlands there; but, having pretty early intelligence that the enemy
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:030190_0265_0FE5072201315410"/>
were maſters of the iſland, and therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending numberleſs obſtacles to his obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clear and quiet poſſeſſion of the eſtate; he formed the immediate reſolution of getting out, if poſſible, to the Eaſt Indies, where he truſted that, by his general knowledge of trade, he ſhould in a ſhort time be able to retrieve his ſhattered circumſtances, and to return to his native country with a fortune ſufficient to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the remaining years of his life eaſy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. At the ſame time he took another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution (the ſource of infinite grief and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet to his family), which was, never to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them of the place of his retirement until he had gained wealth ſufficient to releaſe them from the ſtate of indigence and obſcurity into which, he was purſuaded, his abſence muſt have plunged them. This object he amply accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in ten years, during all which time his family conſidered him as dead; and at the end of that period he was now returning to ſhare his riches with thoſe whom he held moſt dear; when the firſt ſight that ſaluted his eyes after he went on ſhore was his unfortunate ſon figuring in the humble profeſſion of a ſtroller. It is impoſſible to expreſs the rage, ſorrow, and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which at once took poſſeſſion of Mr. Smithſon's breaſt, when he was at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that his eyes and ears did not deceive him. He ſuddenly left the theatre, or rather barn, before the play was half over, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no farther notice of his ſon than to leave a note directed for him, and filled with the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt reproaches, he hurried on board the ſhip. Upon his arrival in London, finding his anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:030190_0266_0FE507309629A908"/>
wiſhes and all the projects of his affection diſconcerted by his eldeſt ſon's imprudence; his next care was to make inquiry about Richard and Caſſander; for his wife's death he had been informed of by mere accident a ſhort time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he left India. Richard he ſoon found out, who, upon the firſt ſummons, flew to embrace his long loſt parent. Mr. Smithſon, after brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relating to him the circumſtances of his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to and ſucceſs in the Eaſt Indies, began, bitterly to lament his misfortune in having a ſon ſo abandoned to modeſty and diſcretion, as he ſtyled the unfortunate Eugene. He added, that the bulk of the fortune which he had realized abroad, he intended now to divide between his two younger ſons, the elder having proved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo unworthy of his favour: that he did not mean to keep them in expectation until his death, but would put each of them in imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate poſſeſſion of an ample fortune; reſerving for himſelf what he was determined ſhould be ſufficient for his neceſſities during the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his life. He concluded with inſiſting, that whatever he meant thus to diſpoſe in favour of his younger ſons, he would take care to ſee ſettled in ſuch a manner, that neither Eugene nor his poſterity ſhould ever inherit a penny of it.</p>
            <p>Richard modeſtly thanked his father for the affectionate care that he teſtified for his intereſt, but tenderly intreated him not to form too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate a reſolution to the prejudice of his eldeſt born. He uſed many arguments to excuſe, or at leaſt to palliate Eugene's indiſcretion; repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the ſorrowful effects that a continuance
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:030190_0267_0FE5073221AB6280"/>
of his father's reſentment might have upon a mind ſo exquiſitely feeling as his; and ended with theſe words: "As to what regards my own perſonal advantage, I aſſure you Sir, I feel myſelf naturally very indifferent; and were I not ſo by nature, the profeſſion that I have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, the precepts of which I have with my whole heart conſented to obey, that profeſſion commands me to fix my thoughts and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations upon matters of a far different nature. Beſides, had I the moſt worldly regard for my own intereſt, the affection that I have ever borne, and ſtill bear to my brother Eugene, would ſtand as a bar to my accepting any fortune to which he had the moſt diſtant claim. I am not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hopes, my dear father, that when your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent anger ſubſides, you will once more look upon him with the tenderneſs of a parent, in which caſe you will, I truſt, applaud the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that induces me to decline your liberal offer." Mr. Smithſon, with aſtoniſhment in his countenance, aſked his ſon if he was ſerious in refuſing ſo handſome a fortune; and finding him fixed in the determination that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expreſſed, he roſe up with evident marks of vexation and diſappointment; and caſting ſome uncharitable reflexions on the deſtiny which, he ſaid, purſued him through life, baffling and fruſtrating the moſt favourite and even lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wiſhes of his heart, he added in a tone of voice, ſomewhat ſoftened, "Little did I expect, when I ſent for you, to find you an abettor of that profligacy which has alienated my heart from your elder brother. I fondly thought that my children would pay ſuch deference to my

authority as even to adopt my prejudices; but ſince you have determined to think for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, be your own maſter. Thank Heaven, I have yet one ſon left." Richard endeavoured in the moſt reſpectful manner, to repreſent the motives of his conduct, but perceiving that whatever he ſaid only tended to irritate his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that it was impoſſible, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to obtain a calm hearing, he reluctantly withdrew, leaving his father in a ſituation not to be envied by a parent.</p>
            <p>Nothing could arrive more opportunely to relieve the depreſſion of Mr. Smithſon's ſpirits, than the news that he heard next morning; which was, that a ſhip, in which Caſſander had gone out in the capacity of a mate, after the failure of Eugene, was returned from her voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in the river. His reſentment was now not only pointed at Eugene for his indiſcretion, but at Richard for his too ſcrupulous, uncomply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principles. He was therefore determined to beſtow his whole fortune upon Caſſander. But what language can expreſs the amazement of Mr. Smithſon, when, upon his propoſing to do ſo, the generous ſeaman, without the leaſt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation or preamble, flatly refuſed to accept a penny of it! He thought, however, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his father required him to give the reaſons on which he grounded his refuſal. He did ſo, and with arguments nearly the ſame as thoſe uſed by his brother Richard, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to convince his father that paſſion had a much greater ſhare than mature deliberation in the ſentence which he was going to paſs upon his eldeſt ſon: "We are all liable to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray,"
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:030190_0269_0FE5073534B0A5C0"/>
ſaid Caſſander: "happy is he who has the feweſt faults. If we do not forgive thoſe of a ſon, or a brother, Heaven help us when our own come to be judged! As for me, I have lived contented with a little, and am not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with hardſhip and diſtreſs. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, therefore, that I ſhould graſp at my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's birth-right.—But I declare, were Eugene no brother of mine, knowing as I do his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons nature and the warmth of his honeſt heart, I would go before the maſt all my life long, ſooner than accept, to his prejudice, a property which nature and reaſon ſo clearly adjudge to him."</p>
            <p>There was ſomething ſo ingenuous in this addreſs of Caſſander's, ſomething that ſpoke ſo feelingly to his father's breaſt, that, in ſpite of a ſhort conflict which reſentment endeavoured to excite there, he found himſelf conſtrained to yield the point, and while he wiped away a tear, the offspring of returning tenderneſs and affection, he took his ſon by the hand: "Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander," ſaid he, ſmiling, "thou haſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. Surely there muſt be ſomething of extraordinary merit in Eugene, ſince he has found two ſo reſolute advocates in his favour as you and your brother Richard.—Well, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give all the paſt—it ſhall be buried in oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.—Convince me, as I doubt not you will, that my eldeſt ſon poſſeſſes qualities worthy to excite ſuch ſentimnets as you have both expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his favour, and I ſhall be happy indeed."</p>
            <p>It is needleſs to add, that the joy produced by this favourable change in Mr. Smithſon's feelings was ſoon diffuſed in the breaſts of his
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:030190_0270_0FE5074552B00EC0"/>
two diſconſolate ſons. Eugene, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of his father's note, had hurried up to town from Graveſend, like one diſtracted, and was now at Richard's lodgings, indulging the moſt paſſionate effuſions of grief and deſpair, while Richard, depreſſed with a load of ſorrows, ſat moping in ſilence, without a word of comfort to offer to his brother. They hardly perceived Caſſander enter the room; but when he met their eyes, they ſtarted as at the ſight of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel. Something prophetic whiſpered comfort to their minds even before he ſpoke. But how
<figure/>
full was the meaſure of their joy when he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to them his father's invitation to repair immediately to his preſence! The ſequel is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to be imagined: all was reconciled: the paſt was forgotten, and the future opened a proſpect of happineſs before them more ſmiling than they had ever enjoyed before.</p>

Thus the Brothers, by the efforts of their mutual affection, increaſed the happineſs that proſperity afforded them, ſuſtained each other under the preſſure of misfortune, and, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering in unalterable friendſhip to each other, at length enſured both their own happineſs and that of their deareſt and firſt friend on earth—their Father.</p>

            <head>THE THREE SISTERS.</head>
            <p>NOT many years ago there returned from Bengal a man whom we will call John Sterling: he had been well educated, was ſprung from a decent family, and brought home the ſame good heart which he carried out with him from Britain. As his fortune was now very large, and he had formed no matrimonial connexions, his firſt care, on his arriving in his native land, was to diſcover what relations he had ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, and to inquire into their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in order to beſtow on the moſt deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, part of his great acquiſitions. It chanced that the perſon to whom he applied, was able to aſſiſt in his ſearch. "Some at leaſt," ſaid he, "of your family, I can give you a pretty good account of: you have two cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:030190_0272_0FE5074A504A74B8"/>
ſettled in London; they are ſiſters, and are by no means in diſtreſſed circumſtances, but are perfect contraſts to each other in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living. The eldeſt of them is avarici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to an extreme, lives in a paltry lodging, keeps but one maid ſervant, and in ſhort ſeems to have no pleaſure on earth, except that of heaping up money. Not ſo her younger ſiſter; ſhe takes care to ſpend to the very extremity of her income. She takes great delight in dreſs, equipage, and every ſpecies of luxury, but her expences of the ſhowy kind never prevent the exertions of her humanity: there paſſes no week in which ſhe does not diſtribute, on an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed day, money, cloaths, and victuals to a number of beggars, who crowd around her door to be relieved." "This laſt couſin of mine," ſaid our Indian, "I like well enough, by your account; but as to the other, not a penny of mine ſhall ſhe have, to add to her heaps, an old avaricious ſkin-flint!"</p>
            <p>With theſe ſentiments, John Sterling ſet out to viſit his youngeſt relation. From her he met with a polite and hoſpitable reception, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from her houſe in a perfect good humour with her and her manner of living.</p>
            <p>It happened that the only maid ſervant who lived with the eldeſt ſiſter, was acquainted in the family of the perſon from whom Sterling had received his intelligence concerning the characters of the two ſiſters. Some of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics had overheard the converſation, and took the firſt opportunity to reproach the girl for the parſimony of her miſtreſs, which they told her had loſt her the ſharing of a fine ſum of
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:030190_0273_0FE5074E810CD838"/>
money. This ſoon reached the ears of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male miſer, whoſe vexation, at hearing what ſhe had miſſed, was almoſt inſupportable. The large fortune, which by dint of the moſt penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious economy ſhe had ſcraped together, now appeared to her leſs than nothing, when ſhe conſidered the immenſe treaſures of her couſin, all of which ſhe thought might have been her own, had ſhe but managed ſo as to gain the good graces of the owner. "Perhaps," ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "it may not, even now, be too late to retrieve my error. Some of my money I muſt ſacrifice, it is true, but then if I ſucceed, I ſhall be nobly reimburſed. It will go to my heart, indeed, to part with what has been the whole joy of my life to procure, but I ſee no other chance in my favour, and this ſcheme muſt be tried." Having taken her reſolution, ſhe determined, as the firſt ſtep, to contrive to fall into company with her opulent relation. This ſhe ſoon brought about, by meeting him at her ſiſter's, where he was almoſt always to be found. She now endeavoured, by every win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace in her power to captivate his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and when ſhe thought ſhe had in ſome meaſure ſucceeded, ſhe took an opportunity to reproach him for appearing to have forgotten that he had ſuch a relation as herſelf. "No, Madam," ſaid the blunt Sterling, "I had by no means forgotten you, but the plain truth is, that finding on inquiry, that your turn and mine were as widely different as light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I thought that no good could ariſe from any connexion between us." "I comprehend you, Sir," (replied the lady,) you have heard
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:030190_0274_0FE50756EA349890"/>
me repreſented in the moſt odious colours, as a pattern of meanneſs and avarice. How cruel is the tongue of defamation! I have laid up mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, it is true, but Heaven knows with what intent! The ſervice of my indigent fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures has been my real motive, and it was only to amaſs a ſum ſufficient to lay the foundation of a new Hoſpital, that I have deprived myſelf of not only the <hi>ſuperfluities,</hi> but almoſt of the <hi>neceſſaries</hi> of life. At length I have attained to my wiſh, and to-morrow I intend to depoſit, in the hands of proper truſtees, five hundred guineas, which I mean to be laid out in the purchaſe of land for the edifice to ſtand upon." The honeſt Indian was completely taken in by this manoeuvre. "How unjuſtly," ſaid he to himſelf, "have I thought of this poor woman! Here has ſhe denied herſelf every gratification for the ſake of the poor, and I have looked on her as a ſelf-intereſted miſer! Well, well, I muſt contrive to make her amends." Then turning to the lady, "Madam," ſaid he, "hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I have miſtaken your character, but I now honour you as much as a few hours paſt I deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed you. But you muſt not prevent me from ſharing with you the merit of the noble work which you have taken in hand; to-morrow I will attend upon you, and will add my part to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which you are about to make." He kept his word, and accompanied her the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: he then ſaw her make a depoſit of the ſum which ſhe had mentioned, to which he joined a much more conſiderable preſent for the ſame charitable purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The worthy Sterling was recounting the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:030190_0275_0FE5075A6B2804F8"/>
of the day to his friend, and was tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him how very unjuſtly he had thought of the elder of his couſins, when he was told that an old domeſtic of the family earneſtly entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpeak with him. "Perhaps," ſaid the good Eaſt Indian, "he may need my aſſiſtance; let him come in." The poor fellow entered. "Can I, my good friend, be of any ſervice to you?" ſaid Sterling. "I am very unfortunate," ſaid the ſuppliant, "and it is only the report which I have heard of your goodneſs, which has tempted me to this application. I lived twenty years in the ſervice of your worthy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle: I married, and when I loſt my good maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſet up a little ſhop: when I was going on with tolerable ſucceſs, I was utterly ruined by an unfortunate fire, which conſumed my whole ſtock. Since that cruel event I have been unable to provide for my young and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous family, and I now preſume to hope that your goodneſs will enable me to put my poor children into ſome way of buſineſs."</p>
            <p>"But why, in the name of wonder, did you not apply to my two couſins!" "Alas, good Sir, I addreſſed myſelf to them in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my misfortunes; but from the eldeſt I met with a poſitive refuſal; and the other lady, though ſhe offered me ſome relief, yet ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied that offer with the condition of my coming publicly along with other poor, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive charity at her door; and indeed, Sir, it appeared hard to one who had been a reputable, tradeſman, to be reduced to beg his bread at a door in a public ſtreet. No Sir, I rather choſe
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:030190_0276_0FE5075BF6CA5E00"/>
to get into a ſervice, which I fortunately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to do."</p>
            <p>"And what my good friend became then of your children?"</p>
            <p>"My eldeſt daughter, Sir, has had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of being protected by your Honour's couſin, Madam Sophia, who is goodneſs itſelf, and who, although in very narrow circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet finds opportunities of doing a thouſand good actions."</p>
            <p>"How?" ſaid the good Sterling, "and have I another couſin? And is ſhe poor, and yet is ſhe charitable? And have I, like a blockhead as I am, been ignorant of her very exiſtence?"</p>
            <p>"There is ſuch a one, I aſſure you, Sir; ſhe is the daughter of your uncle, and young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the three ſiſters."</p>
            <p>"Is this poſſible?" ſaid the Eaſt Indian, "and if ſo, how comes it about that neither of her ſiſters have mentioned her name <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>? Where has ſhe lived? How came ſhe ſo poor?"</p>
            <p>"The good lady, Sir, truſted her fortune in the hands of a merchant who became a bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and loſt nearly the whole of it. She then retired, with what little ſhe had remaining, to a village in the country, where ſhe boarded at the houſe of a friend of her's who married a clergyman. There, from her ſmall income, ſhe found means to be of infinite ſervice to her poor neighbours; ſhe viſited the ſick, ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the young, and by her example and advice, ſhe reclaimed the idle, and encouraged the worthy members of ſociety. As to her name not being mentioned to you by her ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I fear their motive for keeping you in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:030190_0277_0FE5075F77C93C18"/>
concerning her, was their conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her ſuperior claim to your favour and protection."</p>
            <p>"This," cried Sterling, "is the exact per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that I am looking for. Come, my lad, get your boots ready, to-morrow you ſhall be my guide to the village where this precious couſin of mine reſides; trouble yourſelf no more about your children; they ſhall hence forward be <hi>my</hi> care: and as to yourſelf, quit your ſervice as ſoon as you can with decency; you are too old to wear a livery, I will provide for you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably for the reſt of your life."</p>
            <p>"Oh, Sir," ſaid the old ſervant, "be aſſured that what is left of that life ſhall be employed in praying for bleſſings on you, and on my kind benefactreſs Madam Sophia."</p>
            <p>Sterling ſoon reached the village. He alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the parſonage, and inquired of the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning his amiable couſin. "She is an angel," ſaid the prieſt; "notwithſtanding the loſs of her fortune, her countenance expreſſes the happy tranquillity of her mind. Nothing, in ſhort, can deprive her of her benevolence, and that benevolence muſt always inſure her tranquillity." "Tell her, I entreat you, Sir," ſaid Sterling, "that a relation, whom ſhe has never ſeen, begs to be introduced to her." So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia received her couſin with unaffected regard and natural politeneſs. "I am enchanted with you, my ſweet couſin!" ſaid the Eaſt Indian. "In your modeſt, neat, linen gown, you look more like a woman of faſhion than your ſhowy ſiſter in her gayeſt dreſſes; and poor as you are, your features are illuminated by an air of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:030190_0278_0FE50769B0591B10"/>
which never appears on the viſage of that other ſiſter of yours; that rich lady that founds hoſpitals! But tell me now, honeſtly, couſin Sophy, how has it happened that neither of my couſins ever made mention of your name to me ſince my arrival? Have you fallen out with them? Or do they not know where you reſide?"</p>
            <p>"Believe me, Sir," replied Sophia, "I love them both too well to keep them in ignorance of my place of abode, and within theſe laſt three days I have written to each of them." "Hard-hearted wretches!" exclaimed the good Sterling; "can I ever forget their indifference to ſo amiable a relation?" "Excuſe them this one time," ſaid the gentle Sophia; "I doubt not but that they meant to have made me amends for this omiſſion, by the future kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their behaviour." "No, no," ſaid her couſin, "I know the vileneſs of their hearts. They were conſcious of your ſuperior merit, and dreaded, leſt I ſhould reward it by beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on you that fortune which each of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready graſped as her own: but their odious cunning and greedineſs ſhall be diſappointed. To your oſtentatious ſiſter I will not give one farthing; ſhe does good, indeed, but it is merely for the ſake of being talked of abroad as a woman of unbounded charity. Your pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurious ſiſter I am ſtill leſs diſpoſed to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. The donation which ſhe has made in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the poor, has her own intereſt ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in view, that it gives me infinitely more <hi>diſguſt</hi> than <hi>pleaſure.

            <head>THE CONTRAST.</head>
            <p>FREDERIC was the ſon of a lady of fortune, who, having retired to her eſtate in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, beſtowed moſt of her time on his educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In return for her attachment to him, Frederic was modeſt, ſtudious, and humane; he felt the obligations which he was under to his parent, and did his beſt to requite them by purſuing her inſtructions with care, and by preferring her company to that of any other perſon. Jacob, a lad of the ſame age with Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric, and whoſe mother's cottage ſtood near the park-pale of the lady we have juſt ſpoken of, was in every reſpect of a character directly oppoſite to that of his amiable neighbour. He
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:030190_0280_0FE5081AF1907A00"/>
was loved by no one, not even by his poor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all whoſe endeavours could never prevail on him even to take the pains of learning to read. The moſt innocent way in which he ſpent his time was in loitering from place to place, and lounging about; at other ſeaſons he was the plague of his comrades, and, in conſequence, the deteſtation of the village. Frederic was too well bred up to chooſe ſo vile a boy for a play-fellow; Jacob, however, taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the opportunities which the ſituation of his mother's tenement gave him, ſtole, one day, into the room where Frederic's playthings were kept, broke to pieces his violin and his chariot, completely ſpoilt his bird organ, and carried off in triumph his hobby horſe.</p>
            <p>The author of this miſchief was ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and Frederic, in the firſt emotions of reſentment, was running, by the advice of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, to acquaint the mother of Jacob with the exploits of her ſon. "But, no," ſaid he checking his ſpeed, "ſhe is a ſevere woman, and ſhe will horſewhip him without mercy, and, may be, ſhut him up in an out-houſe for a week together. How ſhould I like that for myſelf? No, no, I had better forgive him, for this once."</p>
            <p>Not long after this, Frederic was walking out with his beloved mother, when unluckily they ſtrolled near a place where the thoughtleſs, wicked Jacob was amuſing himſelf by throwing ſtones with all his little force at every object within his reach, totally regardleſs of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which he might occaſion. One of theſe unluckily hit the little Frederic on the head,
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:030190_0281_0FE5081EEDD36E18"/>
and fetched the blood; but Frederic was too much of a man to cry at a little pain.—"Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma," ſaid the ſpirited lad, "this ſtone has hurt me a little, but I dare ſay the pain will ſoon be over." As his forehead, however, was all covered with blood, his mother went directly home with him and had every proper care taken of his wound. It was an ugly one, and brought on a fever, and it was the end of ſeven or eight days before he was permitted to walk out, and his mother being engaged with company, ordered a ſervant to accompany him. As they were walking, the diſcourſe turned on the wickedneſs of Jacob: and juſt as the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic was hopeing that they might ſee nothing of him during their walk, they heard a ruſtling noiſe in a tree behind them, and down, at once, came Jacob, ſcreaming and crying, from the top of an elm, which his uſual ſpirit of miſchief had tempted him to climb in purſuit of a crow's neſt. "I fear," ſaid Frederic, exerting his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours to raiſe the poor wretch, "that you have hurt yourſelf ſadly." Jacob ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his groans and cries; and well he might, for, upon examination, his leg appeared to be, broken in two places, "Poor fellow," ſaid the benevolent Frederic, "how he muſt ſuffer! let us contrive ſome how or other, to convey him home to his mother.—Unhappy woman! what diſtreſs muſt ſhe not feel when ſhe ſees the condition of her unlucky ſon!" Her diſtreſs was great indeed. "Poor as I am," ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "I can juſt ſupport myſelf and this ungracious lad; but how ſhall I ever be able to pay the long demand which the ſurgeon will
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:030190_0282_0FE5082AB4ED9368"/>
have upon me, by the time that Jacob reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers." Little Frederic, who was a witneſs to her complaints, afforded to them thoſe tears which his own ſuffering could never extort from him.—"Make yourſelf eaſy, my good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour," ſaid the amiable boy, "and oblige me ſo far as to accept this new crown-piece, which my good Mama has juſt given me that I might buy me a fairing, but I can do without it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>you</hi> can." The afflicted mother looked at him with ſilent admiration. Frederic pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to aſſure her, that he was conſcious of the ſmallneſs of the ſum, (though it was his all) he would uſe his intereſt with his parent for a larger ſupply, and did not doubt to obtain it. The unfortunate woman now found her tongue, and expreſſed in the moſt affecting terms, her aſtoniſhment at ſeeing his earneſtneſs in reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that worthleſs lad, by whoſe miſchievous hand his forehead was <hi>ſtill</hi> ſmarting. "This," ſaid ſhe, "is <hi>truly</hi> to return good for evil!" Frederic now returned to his mother, and after giving her the hiſtory of the whole occurrence, "How comes it, Mama," ſaid he, "that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I was truly ſorry for poor Jacob's miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and though I feel both for him and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <l>So three doors off the chaiſe was ſtaid,</l>

               <l>Now Mrs. Gilpin—careful ſoul—</l>
               <l>Had two ſtone bottles found,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Each bottle had a curling ear,</l>

               <l>Upon his nimble ſteed,</l>
               <l>Full ſlowly pacing o'er the ſtones,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>But finding ſoon a ſmoother road</l>
               <l>Beneath his well-ſhod feet,</l>
               <l>The ſnorting beaſt began to trot,</l>

               <l>So, "Fair and ſoftly," John he cried,</l>

            <head>FATAL EFFECTS OF DELAY.</head>
            <p>CHARLES STANLEY was the ſecond ſon of a gentleman, who poſſeſſed a ſmall eſtate in Yorkſhire, (Old England) which at his death was deſigned for his eldeſt ſon, and the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt was to be brought up to ſome genteel buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by which he might improve the little for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which his father intended for him. Charles gave early marks of a ſweet and engaging tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; he was dutiful to his parents, he tenderly loved his brother, and was ſo obliging to the ſervants, that he became the favourite with them all. Every little boy in the village talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the good nature of little Charles, and of his willingneſs to part with his ſweetmeats and playthings.</p>
            <p>When Charles was about four years old, his father ſent him to a neighbouring ſchool, where he was very ſoon as much remarked for the progreſs he made in learning as he had been for his ſweet temper. He read better than any boy in the ſchool, and whenever he went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:030190_0295_0FE50869C6FF6D78"/>
his maſter to ſpell, he was certain to get the firſt place. This great quickneſs gave much delight to his fond parents and his tutor, though they obſerved that with all his good qualities, Charles had one capital fault; inſtead of going directly to ſchool he would often loiter in the fields till long after the other boys had gone in, and his books were always to be ſought for at the very time when he ſhould have taken them to his maſter.</p>
            <p>At a proper age, Charles was placed by his father at a great ſchool, where he no longer found the indulgence to his faults, which he had met with from the village tutor. He was not allowed to defer the morning's taſk till the afternoon, and it was remarked to him that he was inferior in learning to many who were his juniors in age. Charles was ſtung with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark; he knew that he was able to excel, and he reſolved that he would at ſome time take great pains, and obtain the ſame rank he had held in the village ſchool; but he thought he might defer this till ſome future time. His work, while he was under the eye of his maſter, was performed as well, and in leſs time than that of moſt of his ſchool-fellows; but the taſks which he had to perform out of ſchool hours were always deferred, and everything furniſhed Charles with an excuſe for delay; not that he paſſed his vacant time in play; inſtead of that he was often employed in writing exerciſes for his ſchool-fellows while they were amuſing themſelves, and his own taſk was deferred till the morning, when there was little time to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it well, and he was puniſhed for the faults.
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:030190_0296_0FE5086BA32709E8"/>
Thus poor Charles ſeldom enjoyed the proper ſeaſon for play. He was compelled to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete his taſk, when his companions were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying themſelves in innocent ſports, and he was ſeldom ſet free from work till they were retiring to reſt.</p>
            <p>Charles continued in this ſituation till the age of fourteen, and was every day remarked for his abilities to excel, and for thoſe habits of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay which often deſtroyed all the advantages he naturally poſſeſſed. Mr. Stanley then took him to London, and placed him with a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, a friend of his, in the city, to whom he hoped Charles would become ſo agreeable, as in time to be admitted into partnerſhip with him. In this ſituation Charles gave the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt proofs of integrity, ſweet temper, and great abilities, but delay attended whatever he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took; he was not dreſſed till ſome hours after he ſhould be at the deſk; he did not get to the Cuſtom-Houſe till the books were ſhut, nor appear upon Change, till every man of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs had deſerted it. With more virtues, and greater ability, than almoſt any man of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, he became a general object of ridicule and deriſion, and when the term of his apprenticeſhip expired, he found that, with a character which was ſhaded with only one foible, all intimate connexions with him were ſhunned by the ſober part of the trading world.</p>
            <p>About this time Charles had the misfortune to loſe his father, who bequeathed him ſuch a fortune as entitled him to expect a partnerſhip in ſome reſpectable houſe. But his known ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of delay prevented his friends from making
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:030190_0297_0FE5086D37DEFA80"/>
the offer; and though he fully intended to ſeek ſuch a connexion, yet he continued to defer it till he had greatly leſſened his little patrimony. His father had introduced him to ſeveral friends who might have aſſiſted him greatly, but he had diſguſted them by his conduct, by deferring his viſits to unſeaſonable hours, and by protracting them till the repeated yawns of the family informed him that it was time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. Charles, who ſaw himſelf in a ſituation where he was very likely to be without either friends or fortune, now reſolved to exert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to follow the plan which his father had traced out for his conduct in life. He could not, indeed, meet with an agreeable partnerſhip, but he determined to enter into a mercantile line by himſelf; and his friends, who were delighted with his exertions, formed ſuch extenſive connexions for him, that he had the greateſt chance of being in a few years one of the richeſt men in the city. But alas! his habit of delay had acquired more ſtrength than he was aware of, and his efforts to conquer it were but tranſient. Charles ſoon relapſed into his former indolence. He deferred buſineſs till he had not time to tranſact it. He neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to comply with the orders of his correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents till the goods they ſent for were no longer wanted; and he omitted inſuring his veſſels, not becauſe he intended to riſk the loſs, but becauſe, as he did not ſee them ſinking he thought he might defer the buſineſs to ſome future <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. In a ſhort time his buſineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, ſeveral of his veſſels had either been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or loſt, his creditors poured in from every
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:030190_0298_0FE50870A0CF2798"/>
quarter, his property could not anſwer their demands; and Charles Stanley, whoſe integrity was reſpected by all, was hurried to priſon, with the conviction that his misfortunes were the conſequence of his folly.</p>
            <p>In this wretched ſituation Charles was a prey to ſorrow. His heart was melted at the miſery which many poor and innocent families muſt have ſuffered from his failure; and he thought of the uneaſineſs he muſt have given to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with agony. Firmly did he reſolve, that if he could ever again be eſtabliſhed, he would atone by his future diligence for his paſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct; but where could he look for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? His mother had no more than was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for her ſupport; and his brother had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given him whatever he could afford. Charles was ſitting alone, reflecting upon the ſad ſituation of his affairs, when he was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that a gentleman inquired for him below, and in a few moments he beheld a brother of his mother's, whom the family had believed to be dead, but who was juſt returned from India with a large fortune. Mr. Hilton was much grieved at the miſconduct and misfortunes of his nephew; but was ſo much affected by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous account of his paſt faults, and his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of amendment, that he generouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged all his debts, and enabled him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear again amongſt his old acquaintance with credit.</p>
            <p>Charles, fully ſenſible of the miſeries from which he had been delivered, was very earneſt to ſettle himſelf in ſome buſineſs which would afford him ſupport; and his kind uncle, who
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:030190_0299_0FE5088013EBAF88"/>
hoped that a new ſcene would be favourable to his new-formed plans, earneſtly adviſed him to embark for India, promiſing to return with him that he might ſee him well ſettled. This good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs filled the heart of Charles with the warmeſt gratitude; he fell at his feet, and declared with tears, that he would exert himſelf to the utmoſt to fulfil the commands of his generous bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor. Every thing was ordered for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and when the time arrived for the ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſhip, Mr. Hilton went on board with ſome goods which were in readineſs, leaving his nephew to follow him to the Downs with thoſe which were not quite finiſhed. But de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay again appeared in the conduct of Charles; he omitted inquiring after them till an expreſs arrived from Mr. Hilton, with the account that the veſſel was to ſail the next day, and that he muſt haſten down immediately. Charles then began to execute the orders which his uncle had left, but was detained ſo long before he could get the goods, that when he reached the Downs he found the ſhip had ſailed ſome hours. Almoſt diſtracted with this account, and with the thoughts of what his kind uncle muſt think of his miſconduct, he wandered about for ſome time in the greateſt diſtreſs, and at length having become almoſt deſperate, he hired a quick-ſailing boat, in hopes of being able to overtake the ſhip. For ſome time they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced rapidly, and gained ſight of the India ſhip, and the heart of Charles was alternately agitated by hope and fear. But ſuddenly the ſky was overcaſt, the ſea ſwelled, the wind roared, and the boatmen declared that there
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:030190_0300_0FE5088D169455A0"/>
was every appearance of an approaching ſtorm, which ſoon raged round them with the utmoſt fury. The veſſel, which was too light to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt its force, was toſſed about at the mercy of the wind and waves, and the only hope the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Charles had of ſaving his own life, and thoſe of his companions, was by reaching the ſhip which they ſaw at a ſmall diſtance before them. But they exerted every effort in vain; a great ſea broke over the bark, and Mr. Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton had the miſery of ſeeing it ſink for ever into the boſom of the ocean, and to lament the loſs of the unfortunate Charles, who, though poſſeſſed of ſuch talents as made him loved and admired by all, yet by one unhappy foible was rendered miſerable and ridiculous through life, and ſubjected to a dreadful and premature death.</p>

            <head>THE NOSEGAY.</head>
            <p>CAPTAIN DORMER, and his amiable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, had lived during ſeveral years at their ſeat in Dorſetſhire, happy in themſelves, and beloved by all around them, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the unwelcome account that the Captain was commanded to join his regiment, which
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:030190_0301_0FE5088EA1AE0A30"/>
was ordered to embark for America. The news of this event filled all the country with ſorrow. The rich grieved for the loſs of ſo excellent a neighbour; the poor mourned for the departure of their kind and conſtant bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor; and the tenants and ſervants wept aloud at the thoughts of being ſeparated from a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter who had always treated them more like children than dependants. But in vain were their intreaties that he would remain; honour called upon him to depart, and Mrs. Dormer ſaw, with the utmoſt ſorrow, that to honour he would ſacrifice the ſtrongeſt feelings of his breaſt. She reſolved, however, not to be left behind, and in a ſhort time they exchanged the tranquil pleaſures of Belmount, for the horrors of carnage and war.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Dormer had not been long in America before ſhe lay-in of twins, both daughters, and very beautiful. In the care of theſe ſweet children ſhe found ſome relief during the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent abſences of her huſband, and would oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en indulge the hope of returning peace, when the Captain, inſtead of engaging in the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his fellow-creatures, might enjoy the delight of improving his little Fanny and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. The children daily became more fond of their parents, often clinging to their father when they ſaw him preparing to go out, and always clapping their little hands with joy when they ſaw him return. As ſoon as they were able to ſpeak, Mrs. Dormer taught them to ſay Papa, and in a ſhort time, when they ſaw him at a diſtance, they would directly leave their play, and running up to Mama, would
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:030190_0302_0FE508902FC3F760"/>
cry out, <q>Papa is come, dear papa is come to ſee his little girls.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The improvement of the children became more viſible every day, and they were daily more dear to their parents, when Captain Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, returning from a foraging party, was fiercely and ſuddenly attacked by the Indians, and a deſperate engagement enſued. The time when Mrs. Dormer had expected his return had long paſſed, and ſhe ſat in ſilent agony look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at her dear children, whom at one moment ſhe feared were deprived of their parent, and the next, ſtepping to the room door, ſhe anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly liſtened to every noiſe, and was fearful, leſt even the ſound of her own breath ſhould prevent her from hearing the well-known ſtep of her beloved huſband. At length a ſound reached her ears—it came nearer; it increaſed, and ſhe flew down ſtairs in the fond hope of welcoming the return of what was moſt dear to her. The door was opened, but it no longer opened to admit the tender huſband and fond father joyfully returning from the labours of the day; Captain Dormer was brought in a mangled lifeleſs corpſe.</p>
            <p>Thus cruelly deprived of her huſband, Mrs. Dormer reſolved to return to England, and to employ her time in the education of her little girls. She took them down into Dorſetſhire, and inſtructed them herſelf; and little Fanny and Sophia Dormer were ſoon remarked as the neateſt work-women in the country. But their good Mama did not direct their attention merely to the little arts of making trifling or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments: ſhe taught them that virtue was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:030190_0303_0FE50893B42E3B08"/>
to accompliſhments, and that what was uſeful was more excellent than what was merely elegant. Little Fanny ſoon underſtood, that though muſic gave her great delight, it was ſtill more delightful by her own ſweetneſs to charm all around her; and Sophia learned that no pleaſure was equal to the pleaſure of doing good to her fellow-creatures.</p>
            <p>In this happy retirement Mrs. Dormer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſome years improving her ſweet girls in real virtue and uſeful knowledge. At this time Lady Aubrey, a relation of Mrs. Dormer's paid her a viſit, and upon her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn would gladly have prevailed with the good mother to ſuffer both her daughters to ſpend ſome time with her in London. This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Mrs. Dormer could not agree to; but as Fanny had ſhown a ſtrong affection for her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip, and earneſtly wiſhed to ſee London, ſhe conſented to her going; and Sophia, who preferred the company of her Mama to any other enjoyment, was left at home. At firſt indeed, ſhe felt uneaſy without her ſiſter; ſhe found a ſolo on the harpſichord was not half ſo agreeable as a duet, and the beautiful alcove in the garden was not near ſo pleaſant, as when Fanny ſat with her there, at her drawing or needle-work. By degrees, however, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came reconciled to her loſs, but frequently thought that Fanny could not enjoy half the pleaſure in London that ſhe did at Belmount, in aſſiſting her Mama to work for the poor people of the village, or in going with her to viſit thoſe who were ſick. But her greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light was in the office which Mrs. Dormer had
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:030190_0304_0FE5089DC46588B8"/>
given her of diſtributing the broken victuals, which were given away to the poor every day at her gate. This was the higheſt pleaſure Sophia could receive. She ſlew with rapture to the houſe keeper to obtain her welcome burden, under which ſhe tottered to the door. She exulted in ſeeing ſo many poor creatures made happy by her bounty, and delighted to hear them ſay, <q>Here comes the good little girl; ſhe will, one day, be as good a lady as her Mama;</q> and ſhe often thought with great pleaſure of the joy which her ſiſter Fanny would have, when ſhe returned, in this new employment.</p>
            <p>But Fanny's viſit to Lady Aubrey unfitted her for the innocent pleaſures of Belmount. She never heard of ſuch a thing as working for the poor from her Ladyſhip; and cards, dreſs, and elegant equipages, engaged the attention of all the circles to which Fanny was admitted. She almoſt learned to forget the poor; and when ſhe returned to Belmount, ſhe ſpoke haughtily to the ſervants, and ſcarcely noticed her inferiors; and when the poor came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their daily allowance, inſtead of ſerving them, ſhe either turned away, or ſuffered her little favourite dog, Surly, to bark at them, and ſhake their tattered cloaths. All the village talked of her pride, and lamented that the good Mrs. Dormer ſhould have ſuch a naughty little girl; but the good and gentle Sophia was loved by them all. They preſented her with the choiceſt flowers in their gardens, and the moſt beautiful bantams and pea-fowls were ſent to the poultry-yard of the good little girl that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:030190_0305_0FE5089F50E59B78"/>
ſo well to every one. When Mrs. Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer came from church, all the farmers and their wives made their beſt bows and curtſies to the good lady, who ſpoke kindly to them all. She was followed by Fanny, who never turned her head aſide; but when Sophia came near, the children plucked one another, and ſaid, <q>Here comes the good young lady, ſee how good humoured ſhe looks: ſhe will aſk us all how we do.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Fanny could not avoid ſeeing how diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able her pride made her to every body, and ſhe found herſelf much leſs happy than ſhe was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe went to London; but ſhe had learned there to think that ſuch behaviour was right, and, if it was an error, ſhe fooliſhly reſolved ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to adhere to it than to own ſhe had been wrong. She was one day invited with her ſiſter to a ball at the houſe of a lady in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, where ſhe was to meet all the young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in that country. Her heart exulted in the thoughts of this gay party, and ſhe reſolved to behave in the ſame manner ſhe had ſeen ſome faſhionable ladies do in London. Upon enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the room ſhe advanced to a ſmall knot of young ladies of her acquaintance; and, without ſpeaking to the reſt of the company, began to make remarks upon their dreſs and manners in a whiſpering voice, but in a tone loud enough to be heard. After ſome time a young lady, whom ſhe had never ſeen before, entered the room, in a dreſs made up in a manner very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from any that Fanny had ever obſerved; ſhe directly began to ſneer at her, and declared, that for her part ſhe was ſurpriſed ſuch ſtrange
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:030190_0306_0FE508A0DC0080B8"/>
figures ſhould think of mixing with people of faſhion, and wondered where they came from. The young lady, confounded at ſo rude a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, retired to a corner, where ſhe was joined by the good humoured Sophia, who chatted with her till the lady of the houſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the room, and introduced her into the company as the eldeſt daughter of the Duke of Dorſet, who was juſt returned from a tour to France. Nothing could exceed the chagrin of Fanny, when ſhe found that the young lady whom ſhe had been ridiculing was the principal perſon in the company, and that the dreſs ſhe had deſpiſed, was the admiration of all who ſaw it. She had not the aſſurance to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to repair her fault by apologies, or to preſs her acquaintance upon the lady whom ſhe had ſo groſsly affronted. Indeed ſhe ſaw that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her excuſes nor intimacy would be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſhe had the mortification of hearing her ſiſter Sophia receive a very preſſing invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to Dorſet Houſe, in which ſhe was not included.</p>
            <p>Fanny was greatly mortified at this incident, and ſhe reſolved never to behave in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner again. She ought, indeed, directly to have endeavoured to conquer every feeling of pride, and to return to that behaviour which made her beloved by every body; but ſhe only reſolved that ſhe would not again laugh aloud at a ſtranger in a genteel company, and run the riſk of offending her ſuperiors. As to the poor and miſerable, ſhe thought them beneath her regard.</p>
            <p>Some time after this, Fanny and Sophia were
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:030190_0307_0FE508A4478FE1F0"/>
again invited to the houſe of a lady, whom, as Fanny regarded her as a perſon of great taſte, ſhe was deſirous to pleaſe her by appearance. She put on all her little finery, but found that one thing was neceſſary to complete her dreſs, which was a Noſegay, and this ſhe was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to buy when they reached the town. They ſet off in the carriage, attended only by ſervants, and by Fanny's little dog, which ran at the ſide of the chariot. Fanny could talk of nothing but of calling at the floriſt's, and of the elegant Noſegay with which ſhe ſhould be adorned. At length they ſaw a little tattered girl laying aſleep upon the ſide of the road, whom Surley directly attacked, and began to ſhake her ragged cloaths. Sophia called him haſtily away, and would have ſucceeded before he had awakened the poor little girl, but Fanny encouraged him to proceed; upon this the child ſtarting up, aimed a blow at the dog, which he avoided, and made a ſnap at her leg. The poor terrified girl then endeavoured to run away, but in running miſſed her ſtep, and fell down the bank into the ditch. She had hurt her foot, and lay crying in the ditch till Sophia ordered the ſervant to take her up, and, contrary to the advice of Fanny, deſired him to place her in the chariot that they might convey her home. She then began to comfort the poor child, and inquired about her hurt; but ſhe continued to cry out, "O my poor mammy, my poor mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, what will ſhe do, now I cannot run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and beg for her and my daddy!" "Who is your mammy," ſaid Sophia, "and what ſhall we do for your foot?" "Oh! don't mind my
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:030190_0308_0FE508ADE11B6EF0"/>
foot," ſaid the child, "give me only ſome bread for my poor mammy and daddy, and my little brother, and I don't care what becomes of my foot."</p>
            <p>The child had ſcarcely finiſhed her ſpeech when the carriage ſtopped at the door of a cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which the little girl ſaid was her home. When ſhe attempted to get out, ſhe found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unable to walk, and was obliged to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the footman, who, accompanied by So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, entered the houſe, while Fanny remained in the carriage ſullenly pouting at her ſiſter's condeſcenſion, and very angry to be ſo delayed. She was indeed ſorry to ſee the poor child ſo hurt, and when ſhe was taken out of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage gave her what money ſhe could ſpare; but ſhe took care to keep enough to buy her elegant Noſegay. When Sophia entered the houſe, ſhe found a ſcene of miſery which ſhe could not have conceived. The father of the little girl had long laboured under an ague and fever, her mother was worn down with poverty and fatigue, and her little brother crying for hunger in a corner of a poor cottage, ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of almoſt of all its furniture, which had been ſold to buy neceſſaries. Sophia found that little Sally had gone out in the morning to beg ſomething for this afflicted family, and that, quite exhauſted with hunger and fatigue, ſhe ſet down upon the bank and cried herſelf to ſleep. The tender heart of Sophia was greatly affected by this diſtreſs; ſhe empitied her pocket of every farthing which it contained, and gave it to the good woman of the houſe, and would not keep enough to buy the collar which ſhe
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:030190_0309_0FE508B173F15918"/>
had once intended for her little favourite ſquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. She then prepared to leave the cottage, but before ſhe went, deſired the poor people to get what was neceſſary, and told them ſhe would ſoon return with her good Mama, who would give them cloaths and victuals enough.</p>
            <p>The ſiſters then proceeded to their viſit. Fanny bought her Noſegay, which was very beautiful: but the ſweetneſs of Sophia, and the cheerfulneſs which the thoughts of the good action ſhe had been performing inſpired her with, made her ſo agreeable, that all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were charmed with her, but paid little attention to Fanny. At night, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, Mrs. Dormer noticed Fanny's Noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay, which, though it had begun to fade, was ſtill very beautiful. This pleaſed Fanny, and ſhe cried out, "Ah! Mama, I was ſure you would like it, it is ſo very pretty, and my ſiſter liked it very much indeed." "Then why did ſhe not buy one?" ſaid Mrs. Dormer; Fanny hung down her head, and in a faultering tone anſwered, "Becauſe ſhe had no money." Mrs. Dormer, ſurpriſed at this, for ſhe had given ſome to each of them that very morning, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from Sophia what was become of it; Sophia then recounted to her mother the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which ſhe had ſeen the poor people at the cottage, but took care not to mention a word of Fanny's ill behaviour: ſhe then told her the way in which ſhe had diſpoſed of her money, and the promiſe ſhe had made of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Mama to the cottage; and ended by begging that ſhe would go with he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the morning. Tranſported with her conduct, Mrs.
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:030190_0310_0FE508B303C4EF70"/>
Dormer preſſed her virtuous child to her boſom, and promiſed to take care of the wretched fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, for whom Sophia was ſo much intereſted. Then looking with anger at Fanny, ſhe ſaid, "Did you then give nothing to theſe poor unhappy creatures?" Fanny hung down her head in ſilence, for ſhe was aſhamed to ſpeak; but Sophia ſaid, "Oh yes, Mama, indeed ſhe gave them all the money ſhe had; except juſt enough to buy her Noſegay and a trinket for her little watch; and I am ſure if ſhe had gone into the cottage and ſeen their miſery, ſhe would have given them that too." "She ſat at the door then," ſaid Mrs. Dormer, "while you went in." Then turning to Fanny, "Proud and unfeeling girl," ſaid ſhe, "who could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vain and trifling ornaments to the delight of relieving the ſick and miſerable! Retire from my preſence; take with you your trinket and Noſegay, and receive from them all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which they are able to beſtow."</p>
            <p>Sophia would gladly have retired with her ſiſter; ſhe was grieved at the diſpleaſure ſhe had incurred from her Mama, and ſhe wiſhed earneſtly to ſooth and comfort the dejected Fanny. Mrs. Dormer, however, choſe that ſhe ſhould be left alone, and Fanny was obliged to paſs the night by herſelf. She then began to reflect upon the happineſs which ſhe had known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe went to viſit Lady Aubrey: ſhe was then beloved by every one, every body met her with a ſmile; all the ſervants were ready to oblige her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all the neighbours loved her: now all was changed, and no one except Sophia, no, not even her Mama, ſeemed to love her.
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:030190_0311_0FE508B48F64F2D0"/>
At this thought ſhe wept bitterly. "And why am I not beloved?" ſaid ſhe. "And why does every one ſhun me, at the very time that they are ſo fond of my ſiſter? Alas! it is becauſe I am not ſo good as ſhe." Fanny then thought of the vexatious ſituations into which ſhe had been brought by her vanity and pride. They had cauſed her to be ſhunned not only by her inferiors, but by thoſe above her, and had made her generally hated or deſpiſed. Heartily aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of her conduct, and grieved at its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, ſhe paſſed the greateſt part of the night in weeping, and reſolved that ſhe would again be good, and again behave in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as ſhould make her beloved by all, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in herſelf.</p>
            <p>Towards morning Fanny fell aſleep, and, as ſhe was much tired with lying awake ſo long, ſhe ſlept till it was pretty late; the next day when ſhe awoke, ſhe inquired for her Mama, and was reſolved to aſk her forgiveneſs, and to inform her of her ſorrow for her paſt faults, and her reſolutions to amend. She was informed that Mrs. Dormer and Sophia were gone to the cottage, and had taken cloaths, and other neceſſaries for the family, and had ſent for a phyſician to attend the ſick man. "Ah!" ſaid ſhe, "Sophia is happy, and ſhe deſerves to be ſo, for ſhe is good; I was not worthy to have the pleaſure of going to the cottage, but I will begood and happy too." She then roſe, and the firſt thing ſhe ſaw was her Noſegay, which the maid had carefully put into a pot of water the night before. "This Noſegay," ſaid Fanny, "ſhall be the conſtant memorial of my faults, and of my repentance." She then reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:030190_0312_0FE508BA1E4E1E20"/>
her pallet, and making a beautiful ſketch of the almoſt dying flowers, ſhe wrote under them in a large hand, <hi>Virtue never fades,</hi> and placed the drawing in the moſt conſpicuous part of the room. When Mrs. Dormer returned, ſhe was ſtruck with this elegant performance, and calling for Fanny, had the delight of hearing from herſelf what had paſſed in her mind during the paſt night, and her reſolutions of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. After ſome time, during which Fanny had entirely laid aſide her haughty behaviour, the indulgent Mrs. Dormer would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the drawing that it might no longer mortify her child; but Fanny begged it might remain, and whenever ſhe found herſelf inclined to return to her former folly, ſhe placed herſelf before the picture, which ſoon became, not merely the ſhameful memorial of paſt faults, but the elegant monument of her return to virtue.</p>

            <head>COURAGE INSPIRED BY FRIENDSHIP.</head>
            <p>Two ſailors, a Frenchman named Robert, and a native of Spain, called Antonio, were ſlaves to the ſame maſter at Algiers. Friendſhip is the only conſolation of perſons in diſtreſs.
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:030190_0313_0FE508C416C9C168"/>
Antonio and Robert happily enjoyed this conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation—they communicated to each other their mutual griefs; they converſed perpetually about their families, their countries, and of the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite delight which the recovery of their liberty, ſhould it ever be granted to their wiſhes, would afford them. Their conferences always ended in a flood of affectionate tears, and this expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their hearts enabled them both to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the hard labour, which was their daily lot, with uncommon fortitude.</p>
            <p>The taſk appointed them was the conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a road on the top of a cliff which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hung the ſea. One morning the Spaniard reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a moment from his toil, and caſting an anxious look on the ſea, "My friend," ſaid he, "all my vows, all my hopes, are directed towards the oppoſite bounds of that vaſt liquid plain; why can I not, in company with the partner of my woes, attain thoſe happy ſhores? My wife, my children, are ever before my eyes, eagerly longing for my arrival, or bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly lamenting my ſuppoſed death." Antonio perpetually indulged himſelf in theſe gloomy reflexions, and every day that he was ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his work on the cliff, he turned his eyes to the ocean, and regretted the fatal expanſe which ſeparated him from his friends and his country.</p>
            <p>It chanced that one day a Chriſtian ſhip appeared at anchor not very diſtant from the ſhore. "There friend", cried the Spaniard, "do you ſee that veſſel? She brings us life and liberty. Though ſhe will not touch here, (for every one avoids theſe barbarous coaſts) yet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:030190_0314_0FE508C811D44CF0"/>
if you chooſe it, Robert, our woes ſhall end, and we will be free! Yes, to-morrow that ſhip will paſs within a league of the ſhore, and we will plunge into the ſea from this rock, or periſh in the attempt; for even death is preferable to this cruel ſlavery." "If you can ſave yourſelf," replied Robert, "I ſhall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port my unhappy lot with greater reſignation. You know, Antonio, how dear you are to me; my friendſhip for you will only terminate with my life. I have only one favour to aſk of you; endeavour to find out my father—If grief for my loſs, and old age, have not already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed him, tell him"—"What do you mean?" anſwered Antonio; "I ſeek your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!—And do you think I could live happily a ſingle moment with the idea of having left you in chains?" "But I cannot ſwim," cried Robert; "and you know"—"I know that I have the ſtrongeſt friendſhip for you," replied the Spaniard, embracing him, and ſhedding tears of affection: <q>friendſhip will give me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled ſtrength: you ſhall hold upon my belt, and we will both ſave ourſelves.</q> In vain did Robert repreſent the danger there would be of his periſhing himſelf, and dragging his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver down with him to deſtruction; nothing could overcome the reſolution of Antonio. <q>We will both eſcape, or both periſh toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</q> he cried. "But we draw the attention of our ſavage keepers; even ſome of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions would be baſe enough to betray us—Farewel—I hear the bell that calls us from our work; we muſt ſeparate; farewel till to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="310" facs="unknown:030190_0315_0FE508C99CE7F2B8"/>
They now returned to their dungeon.—Antonio was wrapped up in the idea of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: he fancied he had already paſſed the Mediterranean, and was in the arms of his friends, his wife, and his children. But Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert formed to himſelf a very different picture: he ſaw his friend falling a victim to his own generoſity, and dragged by him to the bottom of the ſea, and periſhing by that means, when, if he had only conſulted his own ſafety, he might have preſerved himſelf, and been reſtored to the boſom of his family, who moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly were continually lamenting his loſs. "No," ſaid the unfortunate Frenchman to himſelf, <q>I will not give way to the ſolicitations of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio; I will not repay ſo generous a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by being the cauſe of his death. He will be free. My unhappy father will at leaſt learn that I am alive, and that my affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him is unabated. Alas! I could wiſh to be the ſupport and conſolation of his age. He wanted my aſſiſtance—perhaps he is now periſhing in poverty, and wiſhing to ſee and embrace his ſon. However, if Antonio is happy, I ſhall die with leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſlaves were not taken from their priſon the next morning at the uſual hour. The Spaniard was all impatience, while Robert was in doubt whether he ſhould rejoice or grieve at the diſappointment. At length they were call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their labour, but they could not ſpeak to each other, for their maſter went with them. Antonio could only look at Robert and ſigh. Sometimes he caſt his eyes towards the ſea, and
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:030190_0316_0FE508D4E2F93388"/>
could hardly ſuppreſs his emotions. At length night arrives, and they find themſelves alone. "Let us ſeize this opportunity," cries the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, "Come!" "No," replies the other: my friend I never will conſent to endanger your life: farewel, Antonio! I embrace you for the laſt time. Save yourſelf, I conjure you; you have no time to loſe. Remember our friendſhip. I only requeſt you to remember your promiſe in regard to my father. He muſt be very old, and much in diſtreſs; go and conſole him. If he ſhould want aſſiſtance, I am ſure my friend"—At theſe words the voice of Robert failed—he ſhed a torrent of tears—his boſom was torn with anguiſh. "You weep, Robert," ſays Antonio; "it is not tears, but courage, that we now want: reſiſt no longer; a moment's delay may ruin us; we may never have the opportunity again; either deliver yourſelf to my direction, or I will daſh my head againſt thoſe rocks."</p>
            <p>The Frenchman threw himſelf at the feet of the generous Spaniard: he ſtill repreſented the hazard of the attempt, and pointed out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable danger that muſt attend his reſolution of endeavouring to preſerve him. Antonio made no reply, but catching him in his arms, he ran to the edge of the precipice, and plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him into the ſea. At firſt they both ſunk; but, riſing to the ſurface, Antonio ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted all his force, and ſwimming himſelf, kept Robert alſo above the water, who ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe his aſſiſtance, and to fear leſt he ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve him in his own deſtruction.</p>
            <p>The people in the ſhip were ſtruck with an

                  <pb n="312" facs="unknown:030190_0317_0FE508D6880E0300"/>
               </figure>
object which they could not well diſtinguiſh. They thought it was ſome ſea-monſter that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the veſſel. Their curioſity was now called another way; they ſaw a boat leave the ſhore and haſtily purſue what ſeemed to them a monſtrous ſea-animal. Theſe were the ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who guarded the ſlaves, and who were anxious to overtake Antonio and Robert. The laſt ſaw them approach, and, caſting his eyes on his friend, and perceiving that he grew weak, he made an effort and got looſe from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio,
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:030190_0318_0FE508D81CD5DDD0"/>
ſaying to him at the ſame time. "We are purſued. Save yourſelf, and let me pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; I only retard your courſe." He had hardly finiſhed theſe words when he ſunk. A new tranſport of friendſhip animates the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard; he darts towards the Frenchman, and ſeizing him as he is juſt ready to expire, they both diſappeared.</p>
            <p>The boat, uncertain which way to purſue, ſtopped; while another was ſent from the veſſel to diſcover what the object was which they had ſeen. The waves began to grow rough; at laſt they diſcovered two men, the one ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the other, and trying to reach the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. They rowed to them as faſt as poſſible, and came up with them juſt as Antonio's ſtrength began to fail. They took them both on board. Antonio cried out feebly, <q>Aſſiſt my friend—I die;</q>—and his countenance ſeemed convulſed with the agonies of death. Robert, who was in a ſwoon, recovering at the inſtant, and ſeeing Antonio without any ſign of life extended by his ſide, was almoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted; he threw himſelf on the body of his friend. "Antonio!" he cried, "my dear Antonio, my friend, my deliverer, have I been your murderer? Alas! you cannot hear me. Is this your recompenſe for having ſaved my life? But what is life? Who can ſupport it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the loſs of ſuch a friend?"</p>
            <p>Saying this, he ſtarted up in the boat, and, ſeizing a ſword, would have plunged it into his boſom, if he had not been diſarmed; but in the midſt of his lamentations and diſtraction, Providence, apparently to reward an affection
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:030190_0319_0FE508DB5B7F2F40"/>
ſo ſincere, interpoſed in his favour—Antonio breathed a ſigh. Robert flew to the aſſiſtance of his friend, who, lifting up his languid eyes, tried to find the Frenchman, and, as ſoon as he perceived him, cried out with a tranſport be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his ſtrength, "I have ſaved my friend!"</p>
            <p>They were both conveyed on board the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. Their exemplary friendſhip diffuſed a reſpect for them among the whole crew. And, ſuch is the effect of virtue even on the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt minds, every one contended with his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in ſhowing them attention. Robert ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving in France flew to his father, who was ready to die with exceſs of joy at ſeeing him, and was appointed to a genteel office under the Government. But the Spaniard, who was likewiſe offered a very advantageous poſt, for one in his ſituation of life, choſe rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his wife and family. But abſence did not diminiſh his friendſhip; he continued ſtill to correſpond with Robert, and their letters, which are maſter-pieces of ſimplicity and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do honour to the ſentiment which was capable of producing ſo heroic an action.</p>

            <head>THE DUEL; OR THE MAN OF TRUE COURAGE.</head>
            <p>MELCOUR loſt his parents at an age when he could not be ſenſible of the greatneſs of his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. One of his uncles took him home, brought him up with his own ſon, and paid the
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:030190_0320_0FE508E20B3ED090"/>
utmoſt attention to his education. Florival and Melcour, already united by the ties of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, were ſoon more ſo by thoſe of friendſhip, which, from their living conſtantly together, grew ſtronger every day. They were both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the army. When they were of a proper age, they got commiſſions in the ſame regiment. Florival always hated application, and the diſſipation that naturally attends a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary life ſtill inclined him leſs to it. As for Melcour, he had not only a very good natural genius, but a ſtrong inclination to cultivate it. His ſtudies had been properly directed; and a generous and humane diſpoſition, joined with a habit of thinking ſeriouſly, led him to condemn the criminal practice of fighting duels on tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial occaſions, a cuſtom too prevalent in the army.</p>
            <p>Different purſuits leſſened, by degrees, the friendſhip of the two young men. Florival was blinded by the love of pleaſure, he ran in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all ſorts of extravagance, and became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in debt. Melcour lamented his folly, aſſiſted him with his purſe, and endeavoured to ſave him from the ruin into which he was going to plunge. He repreſented to him how much his conduct degraded him in the eyes of ſenſible people. "Even thoſe," ſaid he to him, "who now applaud your extravagance, will be the firſt to upbraid you when they ſee you in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. They call themſelves your beſt friends, and you believe them; they have eſtranged you from me. They have painted me to you in the moſt unfavourable colours, and if they have not entirely extinguiſhed the friendſhip
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:030190_0321_0FE508E5A487CE80"/>
that ſubſiſted between us, at leaſt they have greatly weakened it. The wretches well knew my ſincere affection for you; they are informed of the pains I have taken to diſcover to you their perfidious deſigns, and they wiſh to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh me for them. O, my friend, if they ſhould ſucceed in robbing me of your eſteem, their triumph will be too complete! But, my dear Florival! I do not ſpeak on my own account only. I conjure you, by every ſentiment of virtue that united our infancy, not to plunge a dagger in the heart of the beſt of fathers. If he were to know the exceſſes you run into he would die with ſorrow."</p>
            <p>Theſe remonſtrances touched the heart of Florival. He promiſed to amend; but his perfidious friends repreſented vice to him in ſo amiable a form, that he was unable to reſiſt. Melcour being informed, that, after having loſt a great ſum of money at play, he was gone to diſſipate his ſorrow by infamous debauchery, immediately went to him, and urged to him, with ſome vehemence, the duties of his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the promiſes he had made to fulfil them.</p>
            <p>Florival was no longer maſter of himſelf; he fell into a moſt violent rage againſt his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin; he even drew his ſword on him; and on Melcour's refuſing to ſight him, he abuſed him in the groſſeſt terms, and was almoſt tempted to ſtrike him. His couſin ſtill kept his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: unworthy as Florival appeared of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, he yet only regarded him as a friend and relation.</p>
            <p>Overcome by this ſteadineſs, he at length
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:030190_0322_0FE508E72FEFAAE0"/>
recovered his temper. He was aſhamed of his behaviour, and begged pardon of Melcour for his violence, which was immediately granted by the generous youth, and an immediate and perfect reconciliation took place.</p>
            <p>An officer belonging to another regiment happened to be preſent during the affair; he had been witneſs to the provocation given by Florival, and he imputed the coolneſs of his couſin to want of courage. He did not fail to make many ſarcaſtic remarks on it, and they came at length to the ears of ſome of Melcour's friends. The leaſt ſuſpicion is deemed injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the honour of a ſoldier. After many inquiries, it was diſcovered whoſe conduct had given riſe to the ſcandal. They were told the honour of the corps was wounded through them, and it was their duty to vindicate it. The means were evident. If the report was true, they muſt fight each other; if falſe, they muſt puniſh the author of it. Melcour was truly miſerable. His principles diſapproved of duelling in any inſtance; and in this, if he obeyed the injunctions of his corps, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the terrible neceſſity of plunging his ſword into the boſom of his relation and friend. But, in vain did he repreſent his feelings to his brother officers, they would hear of nothing but the choice of weapons, time, and place. His ſorrow was unutterable: he retired to his apartment. Florival, who went to look for him, found him leaning on a table, hiding his face with his hands, his eyes ſtreaming with tears, and his continual ſighs only interrupted by the frequent repetition of the name of Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:030190_0323_0FE508EA6E41D7B8"/>
At ſuch a ſight he was not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf; he threw himſelf at the feet of his friend. His appearance recalled to Melcour all the horror of his ſituation—"What! in a moment I am called upon to pierce your heart, and do you come to ſeek me?—O Florival!" ſaid he, his voice almoſt choaked with tears, "ſhould my arm deprive you of life, I would not ſurvive you. What ſhould I ſay to your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? did he take ſo much care of my infancy, to ſee me ſtained with the blood of his ſon? O, wretched old man, whatever may be the event of this horrid duel, it will be an eternal ſource of anguiſh for you!"</p>
            <p>At this inſtant ſome of the officers forced open the door; they came to tell Melcour he could not delay the combat any longer without giving room to call his courage in queſtion. What a terrible ſituation! At this inſtant the two friends were embracing each other—they were unable to return any anſwer.</p>
            <p>Florival was the firſt who broke this mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſilence. In him the miſtaken principles of honour at preſent prevailed over thoſe of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. He got up, and extended his arm to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Melcour, without daring to look at him. He aroſe and walked about the room in the greateſt agitation; he fancied he ſaw his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and friend murdered by his hands, and his diſtracted uncle demanding vengeance for the blood of his ſon. At length, recovering himſelf, he turned to the officers, and ſaid to to them in a firm and reſolute tone of voice: I will no longer heſitate to act the part which is pointed out to me by the voice of religion, of
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:030190_0324_0FE508F42A6E2EC0"/>
reaſon, and of humanity, be the conſequence what it may. My determination is fixed. Go, and inform thoſe who ſent you, that Melcour prefers an <hi>imaginary</hi> diſhonour to a <hi>real</hi> crime, and that no conſideration upon earth ſhall tempt him to point his ſword againſt the boſom of his friend. This anſwer determined his fate. His brother officers informed him with the ſincereſt regret, that, as he had refuſed to fight, it was impoſſible for them to roll with him, and that he muſt quit the regiment. Who can deſcribe the feelings of Florival, when he heard this ſentence? it was <hi>be</hi> who had brought Melcour into this terrible ſituation. The diſgrace of his couſin was owing to <hi>his</hi> follies. Theſe thoughts almoſt drove him to diſtraction. His friends were alarmed for the conſequences, and removed him by force from the mournful ſcene.</p>
            <p>Melcour, left to himſelf, ſoon determined what ſteps to take. He was determined not to return home, to be there expoſed to a diſgrace he was conſcious of not deſerving. He reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to endeavour to improve the talents which Nature had endowed him with by travelling, till time ſhould either obliterate the memory of this unfortunate adventure, or ſhow it in its true light. That very evening he made the proper preparations for his journey, and wrote a letter to his couſin, acquainting him with his intended expedition. "Inform my uncle," he added, "of all that has happened; let him know that they wanted to compel me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your murderer. He will ſhudder at the thought. Though theſe barbarians, guided
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:030190_0325_0FE508F5C873CD98"/>
only by a falſe ſenſe of honour, think me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to ſerve my king and country, he at leaſt will applaud the courageous efforts I have made to preſerve us both from a crime. This leſſon, my dear Florival, will be of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to you; your eyes are now opened to the conduct of your companions. Still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue your regard for me; and never eſteem me unhappy while I preſerve a place in your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip."</p>
            <p>He ſet out at day-break the next morning, accompanied by a ſingle ſervant. He had not gone many miles from the garriſon when he ſaw a large detachment of the enemy on the point of defeating an inferior number of French troops. He could not behold his countrymen in danger of being vanquiſhed without burning with ardour to aſſiſt them. Regardleſs of the danger of the attempt, he only liſtened to the call of glory; and this Melcour, whoſe cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his brother officers had preſumed to queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, flew to the field of battle, performed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies of valour, took one of the enemy's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and animating his countrymen by his example, they obtained the victory.</p>
            <p>The general officer who commanded the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment was charmed with the bravery of the young warrior, and earneſtly deſired to know his name. "Sir," he replied, "I will tell you who I am directly; but, will you give me leave firſt to aſk, what is the immediate deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of your detachment?" "It is going," ſaid he, "to reinforce the neighbouring garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon," (naming that which Melcour had left.) "of which I am to take the command," <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Sir," ſaid Melcour, "if you will permit me, I will attend you thither, and receive there thoſe marks of your approbation that you ſhall be pleaſed to honour me with."</p>
            <p>They arrived. "Sir," ſaid Melcour, "the only favour I aſk of you, is to call together the officers of the regiment of ***" (that which he had quitted); they aſſembled, and Melcour appeared. "Behold, gentlemen," ſaid he, "the unfortunate victim of a falſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to which you ſacrifice every thing, though it often renders you cruel and unjuſt. Becauſe I refuſed to ſtain my hands with the blood of a relation younger than myſelf, and who had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated a very ſlight offence by the moſt unequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal marks of ſorrow and repentance; becauſe I liſtened to the voice of religion and humanity; becauſe I reſpected the laws, you have judged me unworthy to carry arms in the ſervice of my country. Blinded by prejudice, you have dared to accuſe me of cowardice. For that accuſation I have taken ample revenge. Theſe colours, taken from the enemy, are a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent teſtimony of my courage." His brother officers ſurrounded him, and embracing him, by the praiſes they laviſhed on him, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes they made, they atoned for the raſh ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions they had entertained of him.</p>
            <p>The general, aſtoniſhed and charmed with the behaviour of Melcour, preſſed him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume his rank for the preſent, till he could have an opportunity of reporting ſo gallant an action to the miniſter. Melcour yielded to his ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, ſeconded by thoſe of the officers of the regiment. "Accept," ſaid the general, "that
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:030190_0327_0FE508FA5EC574E8"/>
commiſſion you was deprived of yeſterday, as a tacit avowal of the injuſtice of that prejudice which condemned you, and may your example entirely root it out!" Then turning to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers who ſurrounded him, he added: "Let the behaviour of this virtuous young man teach you, for the future, not to accuſe that perſon of cowardice, who, obedient to the laws of true honour, and of his country, refuſes to become a murderer. Renounce, gentlemen, that fatal error, which ſhows you the man of true courage in him who is not afraid to waſh out an injury in the blood of his fellow citizen: behold him rather in the perſon who has greatneſs of ſoul to be above the deſire of revenge. For the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, defer your quarrels till the day of battle, and let the conteſts for ſuperior reſolution be decided in the face of the enemies of your king and country. Or, if the inſult offered you is amenable to the laws, let the laws fix that ignominy on your adverſary that his conduct may deſerve. But, let your warmeſt praiſes be beſtowed on Melcour, and on thoſe who have the magnanimity to follow the example he has this day given us."</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to deſcribe the tranſports of Florival during this affecting ſcene. From that moment he renounced his fatal errors, and, ſtrictly keeping the ſolemn promiſes he had made to his friend, and profiting by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they both were raiſed to the higheſt ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the army, which they filled with the greateſt honour to themſelves, their family, and their country.</p>

            <p>EMMELINE was the daughter of a gentleman of large fortune; ſhe was always dreſſed in the moſt elegant manner; her nurſery was filled with the moſt expenſive toys, and ſhe had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſervants to wait upon her. If ſhe wiſhed for any thing, however abſurd in itſelf, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of pleaſing her when obtained, yet Emmeline muſt be indulged. Not a ſervant in the houſe was ſuffered to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap>

ſometimes, if they happened to diſpleaſe her, ſhe would ſcratch and beat them in the moſt violent manner. Notwithſtanding her finery, and her ſuperfluity of toys, notwithſtanding ſhe had every thing at her command which riches could procure, and every one was ſtriving to make her happy, ſhe was a moſt miſerable lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle girl. Her tyrannical temper made her univerſally diſliked, even by thoſe who were obliged to be ſubſervient to her, and her fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and ill humour was a conſtant thorn in her own boſom.</p>
            <p>At the entrance of her father's park ſtood a lodge, which was inhabited by a poor man who had alſo one daughter. Little Jenny was one of the beſt tempered girls in the world; ſhe was never ſeen crying and out of humour like Emmeline, but on the contrary, was civil and obliging to every body. There was not a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant at the hall but loved her as if ſhe had been their own child; and never did they go down to the lodge, but they were ſure to carry her an apple, or a piece of plum-cake, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nice in their pockets. It frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that Jenny was ſent for to play with Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meline, which ſhe did not like at all, for the young lady was ſo whimſical it was impoſſible to pleaſe her, and frequently would deſire Jenny to do what was very improper. On ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions the would never comply; for though ſhe paid the haughty little girl every reſpect which was due to her rank, ſhe never forgot what was due to herſelf: well knowing that a wrong ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is equally culpable, whether he perſon who tempts us to commit it, be poor or rich.
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:030190_0330_0FE50905FAE1EDC8"/>
If in their play they happened to break any thing, Emmeline would deſire Jenny to ſay it was one of the ſervants who did it; and when ſhe refuſed to be guilty of ſo wicked an action, Emmeline would put herſelf in a violent paſſion, and frequently beat her. In ſhort it is not to be conceived how diſagreeable ſhe made her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. She was alſo very ignorant; ſhe could neither read, nor write; for though ſhe had ſeveral maſters, not one of them attended her more than three or four leſſons. Mrs. Gordon would not permit her to be reprimanded, and no one could long endure her unreſtrained inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. She was therefore unacquainted with the moſt common branches of learning, and when Jenny, who was nearly the ſame age, could read very well, Emmeline ſcarcely knew her letters. Jenny was one day as uſual ſent for to the hall, and when ſhe arrived ſhe found the young lady in the parlour with her Papa and Mama, who were endeavouring to divert her by a great variety of very pretty prints, which they had ſent for from London. She looked at them a little time, and then being tired, toſſed them away. Jenny took one to look at, when Emmeline ſnatching it from her, aſked her how ſhe dared touch it? <q>I beg your pardon, Miſs Emmeline, ſaid ſhe but I was only going to look at it.</q>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
               <p>I thought, Miſs Emmeline, you ſent for me to play with you, and not to laugh at my dreſs; it is the beſt my father

            <sp>
               <speaker>Emmeline.</speaker>
               <p>Oh I do not know: pray don't aſk me ſuch queſtions. Come let us go and play.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>They went into the garden, accompanied by a ſervant, for Emmeline was never ſuffered to move without one. As they were running about, Emmeline happened to fall, and ſcratch her arm againſt a gooſeberry buſh. She im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately began to cry and ſhriek ſo loud, that in a few minutes her Papa, Mama, and half the ſervants came running to ſee what was the matter. Mrs. Gordon chided the ſervant very much for the accident, though ſhe well knew it was in no ſervant's power to prevent her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's doing what ſhe liked. Mr. Gordon took her in his arms, and carried her into the houſe; but it was ſome hours before ſhe could be paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Such was the child, whom unbounded indulgence had totally ſpoiled, for Emmeline had not naturally bad diſpoſitions. With in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing years, her faults increaſed alſo, and her parents then began to ſee, and lament the folly of their conduct. Every pleaſure, every comfort of their lives were totally deſtroyed. They could not enjoy their own home from the wretched temper of their daughter, nor were they happier when abroad, as their fears for her ſafety were ever awake. They knew no one
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:030190_0332_0FE50910ABF743A8"/>
could controul her, and that however dangerous what ſhe had a fancy for, that, ſhe would do. They were invited to ſpend a month at a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's ſeat at ſome miles diſtance. Not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great reluctance did they accept the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but at length it was determined Jenny ſhould ſtay with Emmeline during their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Poor Jenny dreaded the perſecution ſhe knew ſhe muſt endure, and when ſhe put on her bonnet to go to the hall, ſhe could not help crying. The firſt day of her viſit was ſpent much as uſual; but the ſecond, Emmeline was if poſſible, more ill tempered than ever; and Jenny, tired beyond all endurance, thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed her: <q>Miſs Emmeline, I am come here, not becauſe I wiſh it, but becauſe your Mama, has deſired it; do not therefore think that I will be treated in this manner. I know that I am poor, and you are rich; but yet, Miſs Emmeline I would not change ſituations with you. Of what uſe to you is your rank, but to enable you to torment others, and to make every one as unhappy as yourſelf? I do not believe the pooreſt beggar ſuffers more than you do. You have riches, but you do not know how to enjoy them, and though you call yourſelf great, nobody loves you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was language Emmeline had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heard; ſhe would have uttered the effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her paſſion, but ſhame kept her ſilent. She felt a ſenſation ſhe had never experienced; and inferiority wholly new. How much did this little peaſant appear ſuperior to herſelf? how was all her boaſted conſequence dwindled to nothing?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="328" facs="unknown:030190_0333_0FE509141CB1E2E0"/>
Such is the power of Virtue, that even the wicked are awed by it. From that time Emme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line felt a veneration for Jenny ſhe knew not how to account for. She ſaw how happy ſhe always appeared, how much ſhe was beloved, and in ſhort, how different ſhe was in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to herſelf. Theſe reflexions firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced her of her folly, in imagining ſhe could ever be happy if ſhe was not good. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to imitate the conduct ſhe could not but admire, and, if poſſible, to become amiable. But ſhe found this a very hard taſk; ſhe had not only virtues to acquire, but faults to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer which <q>had grown with her growth, and ſtrengthened with her ſtrength.</q> But yet, though it was difficult, it was not impoſſible; ſhe told her reſolution to Jenny, who could ſcarcely contain the raptures ſhe felt at hearing this declaration; and ſhe thought Emmeline had never appeared ſo lovely as in that moment. Her countenance was no longer clouded by frowns and tears; ſhe began to feel what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs virtue can beſtow, and that it is ſhe alone who makes us truly great.</p>
            <p>Very often did ſhe relapſe into her former habits, but reflexion, by pointing out their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and experience, by ſhowing their miſery, fortified her mind to reſiſt their attacks; Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny too was near, and aſſiſted her to conquer them. Hitherto the profuſion of money, which the too great indulgence of her parents had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her, had been ſpent in cakes, ſugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plums, and toys; but now, a new ſource of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light was opened to her; ſhe taſted the charms of benevolence, and her boſom was warmed by
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:030190_0334_0FE50915AA2D64D0"/>
the emanations of charity. The poor of the village ſaw in her a riſing benefactreſs, and the widow and the orphan prayed for her happineſs. The ſervants too, whom ſhe now treated in a very different manner, reſpected her as much as they had before deſpiſed her; and every one was eager to wait upon, and oblige her. As for Jenny, by whoſe example and advice the little tyrant had been reclaimed (for it was ſhe who had taught her to pray Heaven to aſſiſt her good intentions) it is impoſſible to ſay with what warmth of affection ſhe loved her. Her ſtay at the hall was no longer diſagreeable to her, no longer occaſioned dread and uneaſineſs.</p>
            <p>Mr. and Mrs. Gordon had been perſuaded by their friends to extend their viſit a month longer. So uncomfortable was their own home, that they agreed to it with much leſs reluctance than they would otherwiſe have done. Two months, therefore, they had been abſent, when they began to prepare for their return. The pleaſure they would have felt in ſeeing Emme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line after this long abſence, was much damped by the conſciouſneſs how ill ſhe deſerved their affection: yet themſelves only had they to blame; for her heart was good, and naturally inclined to virtue; but <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> deſtructive are the conſequences of unreſtrained indulgence, that human nature is vitiated by it.</p>
            <p>The firſt glance Emmeline caught of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage among the trees, her heart began to beat with unuſual ſenſations. She felt the painful emotions of conſcious ſhame; ſhe knew how ill ſhe had requited the tenderneſs of her parents, and after a ſtruggle with ſome <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

ſparks of pride, ſhe determined to confeſs her faults, and entreat her parents' forgiveneſs. As ſoon as they entered the houſe, ſhe expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a manner very different from her former habits, the joy ſhe felt at ſeeing them. They claſped her to their boſoms, and looked at each other in ſilent aſtoniſhment. They now began to diſplay the profuſion of toys, which they had brought her home, and aſked her how ſhe liked them? She made no anſwer, but burſting into an agony of tears, threw herſelf on her knees before them, and declared her conduct had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto made her unworthy their goodneſs, but ſhe would in future endeavour to deſerve it more.</p>
            <p>Inexpreſſible were the raptures of Mr. and Mrs. Gordon, they could not find words to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their feelings, but each endeavoured to exceed the other in the moſt affectionate ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes. She now conſtituted their happineſs as truly as ſhe had before been the cauſe of their ſorrow. Her bad habits had been too long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged to yield to any thing but time and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; yet her relapſes were ſhort, and the contrition ſhe felt, was her beſt ſecurity againſt their return. When her parents were informed it was to Jenny they were in a great meaſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for their daughter's reformation, they determined their gratitude ſhould equal her virtue.</p>
            <p>Emmeline had very ſoon a worthy woman provided as a governeſs for her, to whom ſhe was docile, obedient, and attentive; and made ſo rapid a progreſs in her ſtudies, that ſhe aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed all who had known her former ignorance.
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:030190_0336_0FE50922B0A08838"/>
Jenny was kept at the hall, and ſhared in the pleaſure and inſtructions of her friend, to whom ſhe every day became dearer.</p>
            <p>From this ſtory, my little readers may learn the benign influence of Virtue. Vain are rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, vain the boaſt of power without it! They can never raiſe any one ſo high as Virtue.</p>
            <p>Let them conſider Emmeline and Jenny. How much was the latter, though cloathed in the ſimpleſt manner, ſuperior to her haughty friend, even when decked in the moſt coſtly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire! Let none then deſpiſe Poverty, it is often found the reſidence of Virtue. Let them pay to merit what is always its due, though found in the humbleſt walks of life. And let every one remember there is no real ſuperiority but that of Goodneſs; and that it is equally the part of Wiſdom and Virtue, to efface the wild ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality, the diſtinctions paid alone to rank and riches, which pride and folly have introduced into the world.</p>
