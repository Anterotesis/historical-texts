            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TWO SHOEMAKERS.</head>
            <p>JACKBROWN and JAMES STOCK, were two lads apprentic'd at nearly the ſame time, to Mr. Williams, a Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, in a ſmall town in Oxfordſhire; they were pretty near the ſame age, but of very different characters and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
            <p>Brown was eldeſt ſon to a farmer in good circumſtances, who gave the uſual prentice fee with him. Being a wild giddy boy, whom his father could not well manage or inſtruct in farming he thought it better to ſend him out to learn a trade at a diſtance, than to let him idle about at home: for Jack always preferred bird's neſting and marbles to any other employment; and would trifle away half the day, when his father
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037145_0003_100C94F0908581E8"/>
thought he was at ſchool, with any boys he could meet with, who were as idle as himſelf; and never could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to do, or to learn any thing, while a game at taw could be had for love or money. All this time his little brothers, much younger than himſelf, were beginning to follow the plough, or to carry the corn to mill as ſoon as they were able to mount a cart-horſe.</p>
            <p>Jack, however, who was a lively boy, and did not naturally want either ſenſe or good nature might have turned out well enough, if he had not had the misfortune to be his mother's favourite. She concealed and forgave all his faults.—<q>To be ſure he was a little wild,</q> ſhe would ſay, <q>but he would not make a worſe man for that, for Jack had a good ſpirit of his own, and ſhe would not have it broke, and ſo make a mope of the boy.</q> The farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for a quiet life as it is called, gave up all theſe points to his wife; and with them, gave up the future virtue and happineſs of his child. He was a
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037145_0004_100C94F289B07FD0"/>
laborious and induſtrious man but he had no religion; he thought only of the gains and advantages of the preſent day, and never took the future into the account. His wife managed him entirely, and as ſhe was really notable, he did not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his head about any thing farther. If ſhe had been careleſs in her dairy, he would have ſtormed and ſwore; but as ſhe only ruined one child by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, and almoſt broke the hearts of the reſt by unkindneſs, he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf little concern about the matter. The cheeſe, certainly was good, and that indeed is a great point; but ſhe was neglectful of her children, and a tyrant to her ſervants. Her huſband's ſubſtance, indeed, was not waſted, but his happineſs was not conſulted. His houſe, it is true, was not dirty, but it was the abode of fury, ill-temper, and covetouſneſs. And the farmer who did not care for drink, was too often driven to the publick-houſe of an evening, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his own was neither quiet nor comfortable. The mother was always ſcolding, and the children were always crying.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:037145_0005_100C94F4166FF520"/>
Jack, however, notwithſtanding his idleneſs, picked up a little reading and writing, but never would learn to caſt an account: that was too much labour. His mother was deſirous he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue at ſchool, not ſo much for the ſake of his learning, which ſhe had not ſenſe enough to value, but to ſave her darling from the fatigue of labour; for if he had not gone to ſchool, ſhe knew he muſt have gone to work, and ſhe thought the former was the leaſt tireſome of the two. Indeed this fooliſh woman had ſuch an opinion of his genius, that ſhe uſed from a child, to think he was too wiſe for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing but a parſon, and hoped ſhe ſhould live to ſee him one. She did not wiſh to ſee her ſon a miniſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe loved either learning or goodneſs, but becauſe ſhe thought it would make Jack a gentleman, and ſet him above his brothers.</p>
            <p>Farmer Brown ſtill hoped, that though Jack was likely to make but an idle and ignorant farmer, yet he might make no bad tradeſman when he ſhould be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037145_0006_100C94F62AF99E10"/>
from the indulgences of a father's houſe, and from a ſilly mother, whoſe fondneſs kept him back in every thing. This woman was enraged when ſhe found that ſo fine a ſcholar as ſhe took Jack to be, was to be put apprentice to a ſhoemaker. The farmer, however, for the firſt time in his life, would have his own way. But being a worldly man, and too apt to mind only what is falſely called <hi>the main chance;</hi> inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing careful to look out for a ſober, prudent, and religious maſter for his ſon, he left all that to chance, as if it had been a thing of little or no conſequence. This is a very common fault; and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who are guilty of it, are in a great meaſure anſwerable for the future ſins and errors of their children, when they grow up in the world, and ſet up for themſelves. If a man gives his ſon a good education, a good example, and a good maſter, it is indeed <hi>possible</hi> that the ſon may not turn out well, but it does not often happen; and when it does, the father has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o blame reſting on him; and it is a great point towards a man's
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037145_0007_100C94F86D74C3B8"/>
comfort to have his conſcience quiet in that reſpect, however GOD may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule events.</p>
            <p>The farmer however, took care to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire his friends to enquire for a ſhoema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker who had good buſineſs, and was a good workman; and the mother did not forget to put in her word, and deſired that it might be one who was not too ſtrict; for Jack had been brought up tenderly, was a meek boy, and could not bear to be contradicted in any thing. And this is the common notion of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs among people who know no better.</p>
            <p>Mr. Williams was recommended to the farmer as being the beſt ſhoemaker in the town where he lived, and far from a ſtrict maſter; and without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inquiries, to Mr. Williams he went.</p>
            <p>JAMES STOCK, who was the ſon of an honeſt labourer in the next village, was bound out by the pariſh, in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his father having ſo numerous a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037145_0008_100C94FAED5BE488"/>
family, that he was not able to put him out himſelf. James was in every thing the very reverſe of his new companion. He was a modeſt, induſtrious, pious youth; and though ſo poor, and the child of a labourer, was a much better ſcholer than Jack, who was a wealthy farmer's ſon. His father, had it is true, been able to give him but very little ſchooling, for he was obliged to be put to work when quite a child. When ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry young he uſed to run of errands for Mr. Thomas, the curate of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh; a very kind hearted young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who boarded next door to his father's cottage. He uſed alſo to rub down and ſaddle his horſe, and do any other little job for him, in the moſt civil obliging manner. All this ſo recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him to the clergyman, that he would often ſend for him of an evening, after he had done his day's work in the field, and condeſcended to teach him him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to write and caſt accounts, as well as to inſtruct him in the principles of his religion. It was not merely out of kindneſs for the little good-natured ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ervices
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037145_0009_100C94FC8155A8D8"/>
James did him, that he ſhewed him this favour, but alſo for his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the catechiſm and his devout behaviour at church.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that drew the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's attention to this boy, was the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:—He had frequently given him halfpence and pence for holding his horſe and carrying him to water, before he was big enough to be further uſeful to him. On Chriſtmas Day he was ſurpriſed to ſee James at Church, reading out of a handſome new prayer book; he wondered how he came by it, for he knew there was nobody in the pariſh likely to have given it to him, for at that time there were no Sunday ſchools; and the father could not afford it, he was ſure.</p>
            <p>"Well James, ſaid he, as he ſaw him when they came out, "you made a good figure at church to day; it made you look like a man and a chriſtian, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have ſo handſome a book, but to be ſo ready in all parts of the ſervice. How
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037145_0010_100C94FE8E26CD80"/>
came you by that book?" James owned modeſtly, that he had been a whole year ſaving up the money by ſingle halfpence, all of which had been of the miniſter's own giving, and in all that time he had not ſpent a ſingle farthing on his own diverſions. "My dear boy," ſaid good Mr. Thomas, "I am much miſtaken if thou doſt not turn out well in the world, for two reaſons:—firſt, from thy ſaving turn and ſelf denying temper; and next, becauſe thou did<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> devote the firſt eighteen pence thou waſt ever worth in the world to ſo good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> purpoſe."</p>
            <p>James bowed and bluſhed, and from that time Mr. Thomas began to take more notice of him, and to inſtruct him as I ſaid above. As James ſoon grew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do him more conſiderable ſervice, he would now and then give him ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. This he conſtantly ſaved till it became a little ſum, with which he bought ſhoes and ſtockings; well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his poor father, with a hard family and low wages; could not buy them for him. As to what little money
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037145_0011_100C9501332546E8"/>
he earned himſelf by his daily labour in the field, he conſtantly carried it to his mother every Saturday night, to buy bread for the family, which was a pretty help to them.</p>
            <p>As James was not very ſtout in his make, his father thankfully accepted the offer of the pariſh officers to bind out his ſon to a trade. This good man, howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, had not like Farmer Brown, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of chuſing a maſter for his ſon, or he would carefully have enquired if he was a proper man to have the care of youth; but Williams the ſhoemaker was already fixed on, by thoſe who were to put the boy out and if he wanted a maſter it muſt be him or none, for the overſeers had a better opinion of Williams than he deſerved, and thought it would be the making of the boy to go to him. The father knew that beggars muſt not be chooſers, ſo he fitted out James for his new place, having indeed little to give him beſides his bleſſing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:037145_0012_100C950323113410"/>
The worthy Mr. Thomas, however, kindly gave him an old coat and waiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat, which his mother, who was a neat and notable woman, contrived to make up for him herſelf without a farthing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and when it was turned and made fit for his ſize, it made him a very handſome ſuit for Sundays, and laſted him a couple of years.</p>
            <p>And here let me ſtop to remark what a pity it is, that poor women ſo ſeldom are able or willing to do theſe ſort of little handy jobs themſelves; and that they do not oftener bring up their daughters to be more uſeful in family work. They are great loſers by it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way; not only as they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualifying their girls from making good wives hereafter, but they are loſers in point of preſent advantage: for gentle-folks could much oftener afford to give a poor boy a jacket or a waiſtcoat, if it was not for the expence of making it
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037145_0013_100C9504ADC26AA0"/>
which adds very much to the coſt. To my certain knowledge, many poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would, often get an old coat, or bit of coarſe new cloth given them to fit out a boy, if the mothers or ſiſters were known to be able to cut it out to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and to make it decently themſelves. But half a crown for the making a bit of kerſey, which coſts but a few ſhillings, is more than many very charitable gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try can afford to give—ſo they often give nothing at all when they ſee the mothers ſo little able to turn it to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. It is hoped they will take this hint kindly, as it is meant for their good.</p>
            <p>But to return to our two young ſhoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers. They were both now ſettled at Mr. Williams's, who, as he was known to be a good workman, had plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of buſineſs. He had ſometimes two or three journeymen but no apprentices but Jack and James.</p>
            <p>Jack, who, with all his faults, was a keen, ſmart boy, took to learn the trade
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037145_0014_100C9506A667E8C0"/>
quick enough, but the difficulty was to make him ſtick two hours together at his work. At every noiſe he heard in the ſtreet, down went the work—the laſt one way, the upper leather another: the ſole dropped on the ground, and the thread he dragged after him, all the way up the ſtreet. If a blind fiddler, a ballad ſinger, a mountebank, a dancing bear, or a drum, were heard at a diſtance—out ran Jack—nothing could ſtop him, and not a ſtitch more could he be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on to do that day. Every day, every promiſe was forgot for the preſent pleaſure—he could not reſiſt the ſmalleſt temptation—he never ſtopped a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to conſider whether a thing was right or wrong, but whether he liked it or diſliked it. And as his ill-judging mother took care to ſend him privately a good ſupply of pocket-money, that deadly bane to all youthful virtue, he had generally a few pence ready to ſpend, and to indulge in the preſent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion whatever it was. And what was ſtill worſe than even ſpending his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he ſpent his time too, or rather his
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037145_0015_100C9509324D4220"/>
maſters time. Of this he was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reminded by James, to whom he always anſwered, <q>What have you to complain about? It is nothing to you or any one elſe; I ſpend nobody's money but my own</q> That may be, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the other, but you cannot ſay it is your own <hi>time</hi> that you ſpend. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon it that it was; but James fetched down their <hi>indentures,</hi> and there ſhewed him that he had ſolemnly bound himſelf by that inſtrument, not to waſte his maſter's property. "Now," quoth James, <hi>
                  <q>thy own time is a very valuable part of thy master's property.</q>
               </hi> To this he replied, <q>Every ones time was his own, and he ſhould not ſit moping all day over his laſt—for his part, he thanked GOD, <hi>he was</hi> no <hi>parish 'pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>James did not reſent this piece of fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh impertinence, as ſome ſilly lads would have done; nor fly out into a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent paſſion: for even at this early age, he had begun to learn of him <hi>who was meek and lowly of heart;</hi> and therefore
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037145_0016_100C950B2134AFC8"/>
               <hi>when he was reviled, he reviled not again.</hi> On the contrary he was ſo very kind and gentle, that even Jack, vain and Idle as he was, could not help loving him, though he took care never to follow his advice.</p>
            <p>Jack's fondneſs for his boyiſh and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diverſions in the ſtreet, ſoon produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the effects which might naturally be expected; and the ſame idleneſs which led him to fly out into the town at the ſound of a fiddle, or the ſight of a pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſhow, ſoon led him to thoſe places where all theſe fiddles and ſhows natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lead, I mean the ALEHOUSE. The acquaintance picked up in the ſtreet was carried on at the Greyhound; and the idle paſtimes of the boy ſoon led to the deſtructive vices of the man.</p>
            <p>As he was not an ill-tempered youth, nor naturally much given to drink; a ſober and prudent maſter, who had been ſteady in his management, and regular in his own conduct; who had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended good advice by a good example,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037145_0017_100C950CAE5F4AC8"/>
might have made ſomething of Jack. But I am ſorry to ſay, that Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams, though a good workman, and not a very hard or ſevere maſter, was neither a ſober nor a ſteady man—ſo far from it, that he ſpent much more time at the Greyhound, than at home. There was no order either in his ſhop or family. He left the chief care of the buſineſs to his two young apprentices; and being but a worldly man, he was at firſt diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſhew favour to Jack much more than to James, becauſe he had more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and his father was better in the world than the father of poor James.</p>
            <p>At firſt, therefore, he was diſpoſed to conſider James as a ſort of drudge, who was to do all the menial work of the family, and he did not care how little he taught him of his trade. With Mrs. Williams the matter was ſtill worſe; ſhe conſtantly called him away from the buſineſs of his trade to waſh the houſe, nurſe the child, turn the ſpit, or run of errands. And here I muſt remark, that though pariſh apprentices are bound in
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037145_0018_100C950E41674890"/>
duty to be ſubmiſſive both to maſter and miſtreſs, and always to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as uſeful as they can in a family, and to be civil and humble; yet on the other hand it is the duty of maſters al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to remember, that if they are paid for inſtructing them in their trade, they ought conſcientiouſly to inſtruct them in it, and not to employ them the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of their time in ſuch houſehold or other drudgery, as to deprive them of the opportunity of acquiring their trade.</p>
            <p>Mr. Williams ſoon found out that his favourite Jack would be of little uſe to him in the ſhop: for though he worked well enough, he did not care how little he did. Nor could he be of the leaſt uſe to his maſter in keeping an account, or writing out a bill upon occaſion, for, as he never could be made to learn to cypher, he did not know addition from multiplication.</p>
            <p>One day one of the cuſtomers called at the ſhop in a great hurry, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037145_0019_100C9510B933AD40"/>
his bill might be made out that minute: Mr. Williams, having taken a cup too much, made ſeveral attempts to put down a clear account, but the more he tried, the leſs he found himſelf able to do it. James, who was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itting at his laſt, roſe up, and with great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, aſked his maſter if he would pleaſe to give him leave to make out the bill, ſaying that, though but a poor ſcholar, he would do his beſt, rather than keep the gentleman waiting. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams gladly accepted his offer, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed as his head was with liquor, he was yet able to obſerve with what neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, diſpatch, and exactneſs, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was drawn out. From that time he no longer conſidered James as a drudge, but as one fitted for the higher employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the trade, and he was now regularly employed to manage the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, with which all the cuſtomers were ſo well pleaſed, that it contributed greatly to raiſe him in his maſter's eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem; for there were now never any of thoſe blunders, or falſe charges, for
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037145_0020_100C9512ACB8D270"/>
which the ſhop had before been ſo famous.</p>
            <p>James went on in a regular courſe of induſtry, and ſoon became the beſt workman Mr. Williams had, but there were many things in the family which he greatly diſapproved. Some of the journeymen uſed to ſwear, drink, and ſing very licentious ſongs. All theſe things were a great grief to his ſober mind; he complained to his maſter, who only laughed at him: and indeed, as Williams did the ſame himſelf, he put it out of his own power to correct his ſervants, if he had been ſo diſpoſed. James, however, uſed always to reprove them with great mildneſs indeed, but with great ſeriouſneſs alſo. This, but ſtill more his own excellent example, produced at length very good effects on ſuch of the men as were not quite har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened in ſin.</p>
            <p>What grieved him moſt was the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which the Sunday was ſpent. The maſter lay in bed all the morning,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037145_0021_100C9514A90338C8"/>
nor did the mother or her children ever go to church, except there was ſome new finery to be ſhewn, or a chriſtening to be attended. The town's people were coming to the ſhop all the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for work which ſhould have been ſent home the night before, had not the maſter been at the alehouſe. And what wounded James to the very ſoul was, that the maſter expected the two apprentices to carry home ſhoes to the country cuſtomers on the Sunday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: which he wickedly thought was a ſaving of time, as it prevented their hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their work on the Saturday. Theſe ſhameful practices greatly afflicted poor James; he begged his maſter, with tears in his eyes, to excuſe him, but he only laughed at his ſqueamiſh conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as he called it.</p>
            <p>Jack did not diſlike this part of the buſineſs, and generally after he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his parcel, waſted good part of the day in nutting, playing at fives, or dropping in at the public houſe: any thing was better than going to church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:037145_0022_100C95169C578228"/>
James, on the other-hand, when he was compelled, ſorely againſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to carry home any goods on a Sunday morning, always got up as ſoon as it was light, knelt down and prayed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heartily to GOD to forgive him a ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which it was not in his power to avoid; he took care not to loſe a moment by the way, but as he was taking his walk with the utmoſt ſpeed, to leave his ſhoes with the cuſtomers, he ſpent his time in endeavouring to keep up good thoughts in his mind, and praying that the day might come when his conſcience might be delivered from this grievous burthen. He was now particularly thankful, that Mr. Thomas had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught him ſo many pſalms and chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which he uſed to repeat in theſe walks with great devotion.</p>
            <p>He always got home before the reſt of the family were up, dreſſed himſelf very clean and went twice to church; and as he greatly diſliked the company and practices of his maſter's houſe, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly on the Sabbath-day, he preferred
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037145_0023_100C95192FEE8200"/>
ſpending his evening alone, reading his Bible, which I forgot to ſay the worthy clergyman had given him when he left his native village. Sunday evening, which is to ſome people ſuch a burthen, was to James the higheſt holiday. He had formerly learnt a little how to ſing a pſalm of the clerk of his own pariſh, and this was now become a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful part of his evening exerciſe. And as one of the journeymen; by James's advice and example, was now beginning to be of a more ſerious way of thinking, he often aſked him to ſit an hour with him, when they read the Bible and talked it over together in a manner very pleaſant and improving; and as this man was a famous ſinger, a pſalm or two ſung together, was a very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent pleaſure.</p>
            <p>James's good manners and civility to the cuſtomers, drew much buſineſs to the ſhop, and his ſkill as a workman was ſo great, that every perſon deſired his ſhoes might be made by James. Williams grew ſo very idle and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037145_0024_100C951B44411898"/>
that he now totally neglected his affairs, and to hard drinking added deep gaming. All James's care, both of the ſhop and the accounts, could not keep things in any tolerable order: he repreſented to his maſter that they were growing worſe and worſe; and exhorted him, if he valued his credit as a tradeſman, his comfort as a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and father, his character as a maſter, and his ſoul as a chriſtian, to turn over a new leaf. Williams ſwore a great oath, that he would not be reſtrained in his pleaſures to pleaſe a canting pariſh 'prentice, nor to humour a parcel of ſqualling brats—that let people ſay what they would of him, they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſay he was a hypocrite, and as long as they could not call him that, he did not care what elſe they called him.</p>
            <p>In a violent paſſion he immediately went to the Greyhound, where he now ſpent, not only every evening, which he had long done, but good part of the day and night alſo. His wife was very dreſſy, extravagant, and fond of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037145_0025_100C951CD0729A10"/>
and ſpent at home as faſt as her huſband did abroad; ſo that all the neighbours ſaid, if it had not been for James, his maſter muſt have broke long ago, but they were ſure he could not hold it much longer.</p>
            <p>As Jack Brown ſung a good ſong, and played many diverting tricks, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams liked his company, and often al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him to make one at the Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound, where he would laugh heartily at his ſtories; ſo that every one thought Jack was much the greater favourite—ſo he was a companion in frolick, and foolery, and <hi>pleasure,</hi> as it is called; but he would not truſt him with an inch of leather of ſixpence in money: No, no—when buſineſs was to be done, or truſt was to be repoſed, James was the man: the idle and the drunken never truſt one another, if they have common ſenſe. They like to laugh, and ſing, and riot, and drink together; but when they want a friend, a help in buſineſs or in trouble, they go farther a field; and Williams, while he would drink with
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037145_0026_100C838EC4BDE1E8"/>
Jack, would truſt James with untold gold, and even was fooliſhly tempted to neglect his buſineſs the more from knowing that he had one at home who was taking care of it.</p>
            <p>In ſpite of all Jame's care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, however, things were growing worſe and worſe: the more James ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the more the maſter and miſtreſs ſpent. One morning, juſt as the ſhop was opened, and James had ſet every body to their reſpective work, and he himſelf was ſettling the buſineſs for the day, he found that his maſter was not yet come from the Greyhound. As this was now become a common caſe, he only grieved but did not wonder at it. Whilſt he was indulging ſad thoughts on what would be the end of all this, in ran the tapſter from the Greyhound out of breath, and with a look of terror and diſmay, deſired James would ſtep o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the public-houſe with him that moment, for that his maſter wanted him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:037145_0027_100C951EF70C7FB0"/>
James went immediately, ſurpriſed at this unuſual meſſage. When he got into the kitchen of the public-houſe, which he now entered for the firſt time in his life, though it was oppoſite the houſe in which he lived, he was ſhocked at the beaſtly diſguſting appearance of every thing he beheld. There was a table covered with tankards, punch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowls, broken glaſſes, pipes, and dirty greaſy packs of cards, and all over wet with liquor; the floor was ſtrewed with broken earthen cups, odd cards, and an EO table ſhivered to pieces in a quarrel; behind the table ſtood a crowd of dirty fellows, with matted locks, hollow eyes, and faces ſmeared with tobacco; James made his way after the tapſter, through this wretched looking crew, to a ſettle which ſtood in the chimney corner. Not a word was uttered, but the ſilent horror ſeemed to denote ſomething more than a mere common drinking bout.</p>
            <p>What was the diſmay of James, when he ſaw his miſerable maſter ſtretched out on the ſettle, in all the agonies of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037145_0028_100C9521DE24E370"/>
death. He had fallen into a ſit, after having drank hard beſt part of the night, and ſeemed to have but a few minutes to live. In his frightful countenance was diſplayed the dreadful picture of ſin and death: for he ſtruggled at once un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilt of intoxication, and the pangs of a dying man. He recovered his ſenſes for a few moments, and called out to aſk if his faithful ſervant was come: James went up to him, took him by his cold hand, but was too much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſpeak. "Oh! James, James;" cried he in a broken voice, "pray for me, comfort me." James ſpoke kindly to him, but was too honeſt to give him falſe comfort, as is too often done by miſtaken friends in theſe dreadful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>"James," ſaid he, <q>I have been a bad maſter to you—you would have ſaved me, ſoul and body, but I would not let you—I have ruined my wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, my children, and my own ſoul. Take warning, oh, take warning by my miſerable end,</q> ſaid he to
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037145_0029_100C95236C7583F8"/>
his ſtupified companions; but none were able to attend him but James, who bid him lift up his heart to GOD, and prayed heartily for him himſelf. "Oh!" ſaid the dying man, <q>it is too late, too late for me—but you have ſtill time,</q> ſaid he to the half-drunken terrified crew around him. "Where is Jack?" Jack Brown came forward, but was too much frightened to ſpeak. <q>O wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed boy,</q> ſaid he, <q>I fear I ſhall have the ruin of thy ſoul, as well as my own, to anſwer for, Stop ſhort!—Take warning—now, in the days of thy youth.</q> 
               <q>O James, James, thou doſt not pray for me. Death is dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the wicked. O the ſting of death to a guilty conſcience!</q> Here he lifted up his ghaſtly eyes in ſpeechleſs horror, graſped hard the hand of James, gave a deep hollow groan, and cloſed his eyes never to open them but in awful eternity.</p>
            <p>This was death in all it's horrors! The gay companions of his ſinful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures could not ſtand the ſight; all ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unk
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037145_0030_100C838D111926C8"/>
away like guilty thieves from the late favourite friend—no one was left to Aſſiſt him but his two apprentices. Brown was not ſo hardened but that he ſhed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tears for his unhappy maſter; and even made ſome haſty reſolutions of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, which were too ſoon forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p>While Brown ſtepped home to call the workmen to come and aſſiſt in remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their poor maſter, James ſtaid alone with the corpſe, and employed thoſe awful moments in indulging the moſt ſerious thoughts, and prayed heartily to GOD, that ſo terrible a leſſon might not be thrown away upon him; but that he might be enabled to live in a conſtant ſtate of preparation for death.—The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions he made at this moment, as they were not made in his own ſtrength, but in an humble reliance on GOD'S gracious help, were of uſe to him as long as he lived; and if ever he was for a moment tempted to ſay, or do a wrong thing, the remembrance of his poor dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing maſter's laſt agonies, and the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037145_0031_100C9526F10316B0"/>
words he uttered, always inſtantly checked him.</p>
            <p>When Williams was buried, and his affairs came to be enquired into, they were found to be in a ſad condition. His wife, indeed, was the leſs to be piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as ſhe had contributed her full ſhare to their common ruin. James, however, did pity her, and by his ſkill in accounts, his known honeſty, and the truſt the creditors put in his word, things came to be ſettled rather better than Mrs. Williams expected.</p>
            <p>Both Brown and James were now within a month or two of being out of their time. The creditors, as was ſaid before, employed James to ſettle his late maſter's accounts, which he did in a manner ſo creditable to his abilities, and his honeſty, that they propoſed to him to take the ſhop himſelf. He aſſured them it was utterly out of his power for want of money. As the creditors had not the leaſt fear of being repaid, if it ſhould pleaſe GOD to ſpare his life, they generouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037145_0032_100C9529EA4B50F8"/>
agreed among themſelves, to advance him a ſum of money without any ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but his bond; for this he was to pay a very moderate intereſt, and to return the whole in a certain number of years James ſhed tears of gratitude at this teſtimony to his character, and could hardly be prevailed on to accept their kindneſs, ſo great was his dread of being in debt.</p>
            <p>He took the remainder of the leaſe from his miſtreſs and in ſettling affairs with her, took care to make every thing as advantageous to her as poſſible. He never once allowed himſelf to think how unkind ſhe had been to him, he only ſaw in her the needy widow of his deceaſed maſter, and the diſtreſſed mother of an infant family; and was heartily ſorry it was not in his power to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to their ſupport, for it was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his duty, but his delight to return good for evil; for he was a CHRISTIAN.</p>
            <p>James Stock was now, by the bleſſing of GOD on his own earneſt endeavours,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037145_0033_100C952BE050EB30"/>
maſter of a conſiderable ſhop, and was reſpected by the whole town for his prudence, honeſty, and piety. We will now proceed to ſhew how he behaved in his new ſtation, and alſo what befel his comrade Brown.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, other apprentices will do well to follow ſo praiſe worthy an example, and to remember, that the reſpectable maſter of a large ſhop, and a profitable buſineſs, was raiſed to that creditable ſituation, without money, friends, or connections, from the low beginning of a <hi>parish 'prentice by ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi> induſtry, <hi>the fear of God,</hi> and an obedience to the divine principles of the CHRISTIAN RELIGION.</p>
            <p>This ſudden proſperity was a time of trial to poor James; who, as he was now become a creditable tradeſman, I ſhall hereafter think proper to call Mr. James Stock. I ſay, this ſudden riſe in life was a time of trial; for we hardly know what we are ourſelves till we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our own maſters. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037145_0034_100C952D6B8F5630"/>
always a reaſonable hope that a good ſervant will not make a bad maſter, and that a faithful apprentice will prove an honeſt tradeſman. But the heart of man is deceitful; and ſome folks who ſeem to behave very well while they are under ſubjection, no ſooner get a little power than their heads are turned, and they grow prouder than thoſe who are gentlemen born. They forget at once that they were lately poor and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent themſelves, ſo that one would think that with their poverty they had loſt their memory too. I have known ſome who had ſuffered moſt hardſhips in their early days, become the moſt hard and oppreſſive in their turn; ſo that they ſeem to forget that fine conſiderate rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which God gives to the children of Iſrael why they ſhould be merciful to their ſervants, "remembering" ſaith he, "that thou thyſelf waſt a bondman."</p>
            <p>Young Mr. Stock did not ſo forget himſelf. He had indeed the only ſure guard from falling into this error. It was not from any eaſineſs in his natural
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:037145_0035_100C952F448D6F90"/>
diſpoſition: for that only juſt ſerves to make folks good natured when they are pleaſed, and patient when they have nothing to vex them. James went up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on higher ground. He did not give way to abuſive language, becauſe he knew it was a ſin. He did not uſe his appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices ill; becauſe he knew he had him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a maſter in heaven.</p>
