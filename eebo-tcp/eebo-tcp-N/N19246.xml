            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>THE next thing that claims our attention after the prophecies of the New Heaven, New Earth, and New Jeruſalem, and which is by far the moſt important ſubject of prophecy, is, <hi>The final reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration of fallen Intelligences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This appears to be the very deſign of God in the new creation, and the deſcent of the holy city from heaven to the new earth, as has been already ſhewn:<note n="*" place="bottom">The Reader will obſerve that the Author in theſe two Lectures has reference to ſome parts of his other Lectures, delivered previous to theſe.—The whole courſe of them that have been publiſhed in London, contain four large octavo volumes.—But few ſets have ever reached America. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</note> and indeed, if this hypotheſis is true, and theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies are to be underſtood in their plain, literal ſenſe, it will be impoſſible to gainſay the <hi>general reſtoration,</hi> which ſtands evidently connected with the new creation. For why ſhould the earth, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:025049_0004_0FCDAF73B3BB1E48"/>
of men, be renewed, unleſs it is the pleaſure of God to renew and reſtore mankind to dwell upon it? And to what purpoſe ſhould the holy city, the habitation of God, and the Lamb, and the ſaints, deſcend from heaven, unleſs with a view to this grand event? The argument drawn from the reſtoration of the natural and material creation, to that of the rational and moral, is to me highly concluſive and convincing. But in the account of the new creation, God does not leave us to our reaſon alone, to draw the concluſion of the reſtoration of men from thoſe premiſes before mentioned, viz. the Renovation of the earth and heaven, and the deſcent of the holy city, how rational and concluſive ſoever ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence would have been; but reveals in plain terms his glorious deſign, and the reaſon why he would have his tabernacle with men, viz. <hi>That he might dwell with them, and that they might be his people, and that God himſelf might be with them, and be their God: and that be might wipe away all tears from their eyes, and forever aboliſh death, ſorrow, crying and pain,</hi> (which are the very component parts of miſery) <hi>and that be might make all things new.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things I have conſidered in the two prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Lectures, and I really think, for my own part, that if the Scriptures of divine truth afforded no other conſcience of this glorious doctrine, THE UNIVERSAL RESTORATION, than what is found in the two laſt Chapters of the Revelation of St. John, there is enough to lay a foundation for our faith and hope in this matter, and eſpecially as God commanded thoſe words to be written in particular, and gave them the epithet of <hi>faithful and true ſayings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we have no need to confine ourſelves to theſe chapters, nor to this book; for the times of the <hi>reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titution of all things</hi> ſhall come, of which St. Peter informs us, that <q>God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets ſince the world began:</q>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:025049_0005_0FCDAFA969234000"/>
Acts iii. 21. And this glorious purpoſe of God, being time which he hath had in view from the beginning, and ſeeing that it is of the higheſt importance both to the honour of the great Creator, and the happineſs of his creatures, we may expect to find the knowledge of it communicated to men through all the ſacred writings, beginning with the firſt diſplay of the light of the goſpel, and opening and increaſing as that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. For this purpoſe let us carefully and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly ſurvey the prophetic writings upon this ſubject, beginning with Moſes, and coming down to St. John; one leading the van, and the other bringing up the rear. And if we find that the plain ſenſe of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy bids us look for the reſtoration of all mankind at laſt, to a ſtate of ſubjection to God, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliverance from ſin and its conſequences, and a return to holineſs and happineſs, let us not reject the idea becauſe it has not been generally received by mankind, but rejoice, and give praiſe to God, who hath revealed it for our comfort and ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>The firſt prophecy that I ſhall mention, and which is the foundation of all the reſt, is Gen. iii. 15. — <q>And I will put enmity between thee and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed: It (or, He) ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This was the firſt intimation of mercy to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of mankind after their fall, and may with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety be called, The Goſpel preached by JEHOVAH.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is without all doubt the very perſon intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Seed of the woman;</hi> and by his bruiſing the ſerpent's head, the total deſtruction of Satan's kingdom, works, &amp;c. muſt be meant, as I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; nor can I ſee how this threatening to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent can be conſiſtent with the common idea of the greater part of the human race being left to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity under the power and dominion of the devil.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:025049_0006_0FCDAF74DB7576F8"/>
Bruiſing the ſerpent's head is certain death to him; and applied to Satan, cannot mean leſs than the total deſtruction of his dominion, deſigns, and influence; and a full reparation for all the damage that he hath done to the human race, and to the perſon of Chriſt himſelf. A bruiſe of the heel is very painful, but the bruiſe of the head is mortal. This diſtinction, which was made by the great Judge himſelf, implies, that however great the miſchief done by Satan to mankind, and Chriſt as their head and repreſentative, might be, it ſhould be healed; (and conſequently the miſery occaſioned by ſin could not endure to all eternity;) and that Chriſt's victory over ſin and Satan ſhould be perfect and compleat. But if ſin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery are to laſt to all eternity, and hold their dominion over the greater part of mankind, we ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt tempted to reverſe the text, and ſay, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Chriſt and his religion might bruiſe the ſerpent's tail, and give a temporary ſhock to his kingdom, yet that finally he ſhould recover his ſtrength and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and be able to ſtand againſt the Prince of princes, and in ſpite of all his endeavours maintain his uſurped authority, and keep poſſeſſion of his vaſt empire, and hold his numerous ſubjects in their ſtate of vaſſalage.</p>
               <p>But as ſeveral paſſages in the writings of the Apoſtles are the beſt expoſitions of this prophecy that ever were written, I ſhall mention them here, that you may ſee how the ſacred writings agree upon this important point.</p>
               <p>Heb. ii. 14, 15. <q>Foraſmuch then as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame: that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil: And deliver them who through, fear of death were all their life time ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to bondage.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:025049_0007_0FCDAFAAE5F96B98"/>1 John iii. 8. <q>He that committeth ſin is of the devil: for the devil ſinneth from the beginning. For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the devil.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From theſe paſſages it appears evident to me, that one of our Saviour's deſigns in what he hath done and ſuffered, and is now doing, and will do hereafter, is to deſtroy and aboliſh the kingdom of Satan and darkneſs, ſin, and miſery out of the univerſe, until neither the name nor conſequences of evil ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in all the wide creation. For if the devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be ever deſtroyed, to exiſt no more as a devil, and ſin, which is his work be alſo totally deſtroyed by the Son of God, then how can the conſequences of tranſgreſſion endure to all eternity?</p>
               <p>But I muſt dwell no longer upon this firſt promiſe, but paſs to notice that Goſpel which the Scripture preached to Abraham, Iſaac, add Jacob, in full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation that God would juſtify the heathen through faith, I ſhall firſt collect the ſeveral paſſages, with St. Paul's comment upon them, and then make ſome very brief obſervations.</p>
               <p>When God firſt called Abram from out of his country, and from among his kindred, he made him ſeveral great promiſes for his comfort and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and concluded with theſe moſt gracious words, <q>And in thee ſhall all the families of the earth be bleſſed.</q> See Gen. xii. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>When Abraham had obeyed the voice of God, and had endured that moſt ſevere trial of offering up his ſon Iſaac upon the altar, then it pleaſed JEHOVAH to confirm his ſeveral promiſes made at different times to Abraham with a moſt ſolemn oath, and this among the reſt. And becauſe he could ſwear by no greater, he ſware by himſelf, thus giving him the firmeſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible foundation for his faith to lay hold upon, <q>By
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025049_0008_0FCDAF77187C91E8"/>
Myſelf have I ſworn, faith JEHOVAH, for becauſe thou haſt done this thing, and haſt not with held thy ſon thine only ſon: That in bleſſing I will bleſs thee,</q> &amp;c.—<q>And in thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed: becauſe thou haſt obeyed my voice.</q> Gen. xxii. 15—18.</p>
               <p>The ſame glorious promiſe was renewed to Iſaac in theſe words, <q>And I will perform the oath which I ſware unto Abraham thy father; &amp;c. And in thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Becauſe that Abraham obeyed my voice,</q> &amp;c. Gen. xxvi. 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>And the ſame was confirmed to Jacob, in nearly the ſame words, <q>And in thee, and in thy ſeed ſhall all the families of the earth be bleſſed.</q> See Gen. xxviii. 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>It is no wonder that the Apoſtle calls this, The Goſpel, or good news; For if any tidings from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ever deſerved the name of <hi>good news,</hi> ſurely thoſe words ſpoken by God to the Fathers do.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle's commentary upon the promiſes made to Abraham may be read in Rom. iv. and Gal. iii. but I ſhall only recite two paſſages out of the latter chapter: <q>And the ſcripture foreſeeing that God would juſtify the heathen through faith, preached before the goſpel unto Abraham, ſaying, In thee ſhall all nations be bleſſed.</q> ver. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now to Abraham and his ſeed were the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made: he faith not, And to ſeeds, as of many: but as of one, And to thy ſeed, which is Chriſt.</q> ver. 16.</p>
               <p>It is evident that according to theſe promiſes all
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025049_0009_0FCDAFB24EB72A88"/>
nations, tribes and families of the earth are to be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Chriſt Jeſus; who was the ſon and ſeed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, as well as the promiſed ſeed of the woman. The Apoſtle Peter informs the Jews that the covenant which Go! made with the fathers, had this moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; promiſe included therein, <q>And in thy ſeed ſhall all the kindreds of the earth be bleſſed.</q> Acts iii. 25. <hi>All nations, families, and kindreds of the earth,</hi> appear to me to intend all people and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons without any exception.</p>
               <p>Their being bleſſed in ihe ſeed of Abraham, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends their being bleſſed in Chriſt Jeſus; and their being bleſſed in Chriſt moſt intend their final ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for I cannot ſee how they can be bleſſed in Chriſt, if they are to be annihilated and wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed out of exiſtence, or, (which is worte) doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>endleſs</hi> miſery, woe and pain. They may be under the curſe and condemnation, and even puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and miſery for age, and yet the promiſe be at laſt fulfilled; but if they are to be curſed as long as God exiſts, I think it would be hard to prove that ever they ſhall be bleſſed at all.</p>
               <p>All <hi>nations</hi> have never yet been bleſſed in the ſeed of Abraham, ſtill leſs all <hi>kindreds</hi> and <hi>families;</hi> many of whom were totally extirpated, and wholly cut off from the earth before Chriſt came into the world: but if the ſcriptures are true that God <q>hath remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thouſand generations,</q> or ages, Pſal. cv. 8. then theſe promiſes may be fulfilled in the new earth, if not before; for not more than an hundred and fifty generations have paſſed ſince the creation.</p>
               <p>Let us always remember, that no length of time, diſtance of place, or change of circumſtances in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, can make the promiſes of the great Creator void and of none effect. All his words muſt be
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:025049_0010_0FCDAF7885CBEAD0"/>
fully accompliſhed at laſt, how long ſoever the time may be. But thoſe who imagine that unleſs the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God are all accompliſhed before the day of Judgment they cannot be fulfilled at all, have but narrow ideas of their vaſt extent, and amazing impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Since then all nations, families, and kindreds of the earth are to be bleſſed in Chriſt, but have never yet obtained the bleſſing, theſe prophecies yet remain to be fulfilled, and therefore they muſt be hereafter accomplished; and their full accompliſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves therein the final ſalvation of all mankind.</p>
               <p>This appears concluſive to me, and I do not ſee how the force of it can be fairly evaded.</p>
               <p>The next paſſages that I ſhall notice, are thoſe which extend the mercy of God beyond his wrath ſuch are Exod. xx. 5, 6. <q>Viſiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy unto thouſands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.</q> See alſo Deut. v. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>Theſe words plainly extend the mercy of God far beyond his wrath, even as thouſands are beyond three or four.</p>
               <p>Pſal. xxx. 5. <q>For his anger endureth but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.</q>
               </p>
               <p>—ciii. 8, 9. <q>JEHOVAH is merciful and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſlow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. He will not always chide; neither will he keep his anger for ever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:025049_0011_0FCDAFB456B2DA20"/>Jer. iii. 12. <q>For I am merciful, faith JEHOVAH, and I will not keep anger for ever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Lam. iii. 31. <q>For JEHOVAH will not caſt off for ever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Ezek. xvi. 42. <q>So will I make my fury to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee to reſt, and my jealouſy ſhall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe and many other texts not only ſpeak of an entire ceſſation of the anger of God, but even repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the time as ſhort, compared with the duration of his mercy: but there muſt be ſome ſtrange additions, to make theſe paſſages ſpeak conſiſtent with the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of endleſs miſery; in fact we muſt be obliged nearly to reverſe them all to make them compatible with that moſt dreadful idea.</p>
               <p>There are more than forty paſſages of ſcripture where it is ſaid of the mercy of God, that it endureth for ever. This is the chorus or burden of the ſong in Pſal. cxxxvi. where it is repeated in every verſe. Now mercy muſt be allowed to reſpect miſery, and is the form that love puts on towards the beloved objects, when in diſtreſs and miſery. It cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be exerciſed towards thoſe who never fell, nor any more upon them who are already perfectly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; and therefore fallen creatures, objects of God's love, are the only proper ſubjects of it. And ſo long as love endures towards creatures in miſery, ſo long will mercy have place; and this will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, or during all the ages that miſery remains. Mercy according to this plan, will outlive all wrath, pain, and miſery, and will reconcile all creatures; and will then return back to its original form and name, <hi>Love;</hi> in which it will remain to eternity.</p>
               <p>But if endleſs miſery be a truth, we muſt reverſe
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025049_0012_0FCDAF7EEE9FF960"/>
all theſe paſſages, and ſay, that <hi>The mercy of God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth but a moment, even for the ſhort term of a man's life, but his wrath endures for ever; follows the ſinner to all eternity; and ſhall never be appeaſed, nor leave any room for the exerciſe of mercy!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moſes calls upon the nations to rejoice with God's people, ſaying, <q>Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people;</q> Deut. xxxii. 43. thereby intimating that the deſigns of God towards the nations of the earth were ſuch as might lay a foundation for joy and rejoicing; and there are ſeveral intimations in the five books of Moſes of God's favour towards the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the earth, which my time will not permit me to mention.</p>
               <p>The name or character of God, as proclaimed by Himſelf to Moſes, is beautiful beyond deſcription, end exhibits as grand and lovely a picture of the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perfections of the Deity as any we find in the Scriptures:—</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And JEHOVAH paſſed by before him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, JEHOVAH, JEHOVAH GOD, merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and truth. Keeping mercy for thouſands, (of ages) forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; viſiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, unto the third and to the fourth genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q> Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>And when Iſrael rebelled againſt God, and he was juſt going to ſwear that the congregation then alive ſhould never enter into the land of Canaan, he never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs firſt revealed to Moſes his glorious purpoſe towards mankind, in theſe bleſſed words: <q>But as truly as I live, all the earth ſhall be filled with the glory of JEHOVAH,</q> Num. xiv. 21. Which I take
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:025049_0013_0FCDAFB548CA36B0"/>
to be the fame that is prophecied of by Iſaiah, chap. xi. 9. and by Habakkuk, chap. ii. 14. and by Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi, chap. i. 11.</p>
               <p>Theſe prophrecies ſhall all have their accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the time of the Millenium, which ſhall laſt a thouſand years. But glorious as that period ſhall be, it will be only a ſpecimen or type of the glory of the new heavens and earth; which I have already conſidered.</p>
               <p>But it is time to paſs on to the book of Pſalms, and to the writings of the prophets; where we ſhall find many declarations of God's favour to all mankind, and many prophecies of their being brought at laſt to a ſtate of ſubjection and obedience to their great Creator; and conſequently into a ſtate of happineſs.</p>
               <p>The book of Pſalms is ſo excellent and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, that there are but few matters of importance but what are touched upon therein; and though at firſt ſight one might think that it was intended whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the purpoſe of treating upon ſubjects of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and practical religion; yet upon a cloſer inſpection we find that it abounds in prophecies of various kinds; a great number of which reſpect the Redeemer in his various ſtates of humiliation, exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—the ſucceſs of his goſpel—and the univerſality of his empire. And it would be ſtrange, if ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a ſubject as the univerſal ſubjection of men to the Meſſiah was not mentioned. But ſo frequently is this great event alluded to in that book, that were I to confine myſelf entirely thereto, I ſhould find matter enough for this preſent Lecture, and many more.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Pſalm, God ſays to his Son, <q>Aſk of me and I ſhall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</q> ver. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:025049_0014_0FCDAF8006CF6C68"/>This requeſt has been made, and the Father hath given all things into the hands of Chriſt, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs purpoſes of their being ſubdued, humbled, made ſubject to God, and being brought back again to the ſervice and enjoyment of their great Creator.</p>
               <p>Receiving this gift, and thus on his part engaging to bring all back again, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt freely came into the world to do and ſuffer the will of the Father.</p>
               <p>In Pſalm xxii. Our Saviour's lamentation on the croſs, and his ſufferings are foretold, and many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular circumſtances of the ſame deſcribed in the moſt pathetic language; but towards the cloſe of that wonderful Pſalm, he is repreſented as breaking out in the moſt rapturous manner and joyful ſtrains, when he conſidered the conſequences of his death and ſufferings: in which are theſe remarkable words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>All the ends of the world ſhall remember and turn unto JEHOVAH: and all the kindreds of the nations ſhall worſhip before thee. For the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is JEHOVAH'S; and he is the governor among the nations. All they that be ſat upon earth ſhall eat and worſhip; all they that go down to the duſt ſhall bow before him; and none can keep alive his own ſoul. A ſeed ſhall ſerve him; it ſhall be accounted to JEHOVAH for a generation.</q> ver. 27, 28, 29, 30.</p>
               <p>In theſe words we have an important prophecy, that in conſequence of what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered, and what he will do as Mediator, all the ends of the world ſhall remember, and turn unto JEHOVAH, and all the kindreds of the nations ſhall worſhip before him. Theſe expreſſions are almoſt as general as words can expreſs, and take in the whole race of men, and the things foretold of them are ſuch as are inconſiſtent with a ſtate of endleſs miſery,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:025049_0015_0FCDAFB8DAA70750"/>
viz. that they ſhall <hi>remember,</hi> or think on their ways, lament their iniquities, reflect on the goodneſs and mercy of God, and the ſufferings of Chriſt; and in conſequence freely and heartily turn to JEHOVAH, and worſhip before him, giving praiſe and adoration to him that ſitteth upon the throne, and to him that ſuffered upon the croſs. For as the kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto JEHOVAH, and all men are his creatures, therefore he has a right to their higheſt praiſes, and their nobleſt ſervices; he claims them for his own, and will have them; for who ſhall withſtand the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the univerſe, who doeth his pleaſure both in heaven and in earth?</p>
               <p>As all that live are bound to worſhip God, and ſhall finally do ſo, as certainly as they ſhall eat, ſo if they die before they have ſubmitted to him, death ſhall not prevent the fulfilment of the divine purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; for all that go down to the duſt ſhall bow before him. And as none is capable of keeping alive his own ſoul, he that has the power of life and death in his own hands, is determined that all ſhall certainly bow and ſubmit to him whether alive on earth, or gone down to the duſt.</p>
               <p>Here we find alſo that a peculiar ſeed ſhall ſerve God, who ſhall be the firſt fruits of his creatures, and ſhall be accounted to him as a choſen generation; not to the excluſion of the reſt; for the general ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of all is firſt mentioned, and then this ſeed is particularly diſtinguiſhed. And this diſtinction of the ſpecial and general redemption and ſalvation, runs through the whole bible, as in intelligent reader may eaſily perceive.</p>
               <p>Pſalm xlv. treats wholly of Chriſt, his church, the ſucceſs of his goſpel, his ſubduing power, and the ſpread of his kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:025049_0016_0FCD83F200D7DDB8"/>How beautiful and grand are the following words, as addreſſed by the Father to the Son!</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Gird thy ſword upon thy thing, O moſt mighty, with thy glory and thy majeſty. And in thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ride proſperouſly, becauſe of truth and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs; and thy right hand ſhall teach thee terrible things. Thine arrows are ſharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee. Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the ſceptre of thy kingdom is a right ſceptre</q> ver. 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>Chriſt here repreſented as armed with power and might, wiſdom and righteouſneſs, truth and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſufficient to ſubdue and conquer his moſt ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born foes, and cauſe them to become his willing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>There is another paſſage in this beautiful Pſalm that has given me a great deal of pleaſure, and that is, that not only the royal ſpouſe, the bride of Chriſt, ſhall be brought into the king's preſence, but. <q>The virgins her companions that follow her ſhall be brought; With gladneſs and rejoicing ſhall they be brought: they ſhall enter into the king's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</q> ver. 14, 15. Theſe words appear to me to teſtify that many others beſides the choſen bride ſhall enter with gladneſs and rejoicing at laſt into the preſence of their King, and be for ever happy.</p>
               <p>The xlvii. Pſalm is an excellent piece of ſacred poetry, and, I am apt to think, deſcribes the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and glory of Chriſt, and his univerſal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over the earth; and the cloſe of it looks forward to that great day when all ſhall ſubmit to God,— <q>The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the ſhields of the earth belong unto God: he is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalted.</q> ver. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:025049_0017_0FCDAFBCCF6200E8"/>Theſe words intimate that as God is the great and rightful proprietor of all, ſo that finally all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the people ſhall gather together to adore him. This prophecy ſhall be partly fulfilled in the Milleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, when all nations ſhall gather together to ſerve the Lord; but compleatly in the new earth, when the kings of the earth ſhall bring their glory and honour into the heavenly city; and the glory and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the nations which they ſhall govern.</p>
               <p>Pſalm lxiv. 9. is worth reading in this place, <q>And all men ſhall fear and ſhall declare the work of God: for they ſhall wiſely conſider of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q> Theſe prophecies certainly intimate, that however long men may refuſe to fear God, and to be wiſe, yet they ſhall all be truly wiſe at laſt.</p>
               <p>Pſalm lxv. 1, 2, 3. <q>Praiſe waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion: and unto thee ſhall the vow be performed. O thou that heareſt prayer, unto thee ſhall all fleſh come. Iniquities prevail againſt me: as for our tranſgreſſions, thou ſhalt purge them away.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is a noble and very important prophecy, and includes ſeveral grand events therein, eſpecially theſe three, 1. That the vows which have been ſo often made to God, and ſhamefully broken, ſhall be at laſt performed to his acceptance. 2. That unto him ſhall all fleſh without exception come, voluntarily dedicating themſelves to his ſervice, in conſequence of his hearing their cries and granting them deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and 3. That although iniquities have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevailed againſt mankind, and even the beſt, yet finally all our tranſgreſſions ſhall be purged away.</p>
               <p>Pſalm lxvi. 3, 4. <q>Through the greatneſs of thy power ſhall thine enemies ſubmit themſelves unto
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025049_0018_0FCDAF8186EBC638"/>
thee. All the earth ſhall worſhip thee, and ſhall ſing unto thee: they ſhall ſing to thy name.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is a glorious prophecy of the univerſal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and humble ſubmiſſion of all God's creatures to him, in conſequence of the greatneſs of his power. And leſt any ſhould pretend that only a forced ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is intended, there is not only the expreſſion of their ſubmitting <hi>themſelves</hi> unto God, which imphes a voluntary act, but a declaration that all the earth ſhall worſhip God, and ſing to him, and his name, which certainly ſuppoſes a ſtate of happineſs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the plain meaning of the text.</p>
               <p>A ſimilar paſſage is found in Pſalm lxxxvi. 9. <q>All nations whom thou haſt made ſhall come and worſhip before thee, O JEHOVAH: and ſhall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify thy name.</q> If there are any nations and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom God hath not made, they are evidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted from this prophecy and promiſe, but elſe I cannot ſee why this is not as expreſs a promiſe of univerſal worſhip and adoration being given to God by all nations, and of their coming voluntarily, and glorifying his name by chearful obedience, as we could wiſh. One would think that nothing need be plainer, and yet many pay no more attention to theſe expreſs prophecies, than though they were not written.</p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> a moſt important prophecy in Pſalm cxxxviii. 4, 5. that may well be connected with the foregoing,— <q>All the kings of the earth ſhall praiſe thee, O JEHOVAH, when they ſhall hear the words of thy mouth. Yea, they ſhall ſing in the ways of JEHOVAH, for great is the glory of JEHOVAH.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is evident this prophecy has never been fulfilled, nor never can be unleſs the univerſal reſtoration of men is true; for the greater part of the kings of the earth have been ſo far from praiſing God, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025049_0019_0FCDAFBE4CCA9110"/>
in his ways, that they have been the fartheſt from all appearance of true piety of any of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race; and have been the greateſt rebels againſt him, and the moſt obſtinate, wicked and tyrannical being that ever exiſted: and ſo have lived and died. But if all of them ſhall be brought to ſubmit to JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH, and to praiſe him with heart and voice, and to hear and obey the words of his mouth, and to ſing in his ways, and to behold and delight in his great glory, as this prophecy declares; then who can doubt of the reſtoration of all the lower claſſes of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? For if the greateſt rebels ſhall be ſubdued, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly by parity of reaſoning, much more the leſs rebellious. And if all the haughty tyrants that ever wort a crown, or wielded ſword or ſcepter, ſhall hear the voice of God ſo as to praiſe him freely and heartily, I cannot ſee but the univerſal ſubjection of all their ſubjects to the Great King, is proved to a demonſtration.</p>
               <p>Pſalm cxlv. is one of the moſt beautiful Pſalms in the book, and contains excellent ſentences, and among the reſt, ſome charming declarations of God's univerſal goodneſs to his creatures, and faithful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies that they ſhall all praiſe his name, and ſing of his righteouſneſs and goodneſs:— <q>And men ſhall ſpeak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatneſs. They ſhall abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly utter the memory of thy great goodneſs, and ſhall ſing of thy righteouſneſs. JEHOVAH is gracious, and full of compaſſion; flow to anger, and of great mercy. JEHOVAH is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works. All thy works ſhall praiſe thee, O JEHOVAH, and thy ſaints ſhall bleſs thee.</q> ver. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>God is univerſally good to his creatures, and the time ſhall come when they ſhall be ſenſible of it, and ſhall praiſe his name with all their hearts, and with their nobleſt powers fulfil his bleſſed commands, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:025049_0020_0FCDAF831A5BE8D8"/>
glorify him for evermore. But all theſe expreſſions appear to me entirely inconſiſtent with the doctrine of endleſs miſery. For how can God be ſaid to be <hi>gracious, full of campoſſrom, ſlow to anger, and of great mercy, good to all, and extending his tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies over all his works,</hi> it he has no deſigns of grace and ſalvation all? And how is it poſſible that all his works ſhall praiſe him, if a conſiderable part of his nobleſt works ſhall never be brought to love him, but ſhall eternally, and while God exiſts, remain his irreconcileable enemies, blaſpheming his name, in a ſtate of endleſs, unavailing miſery?</p>
               <p>The book of Pſalms abounds with prophecies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſubject, many of which I have paſſed over for the ſake of brevity; and the very laſt verſe in the book, though it ſtands in our tranſiation in the form of an exhortation or command, <q>Let every thing that hath breath praiſe the Lord;</q> yet it might be rendered, perhaps with more propriety, <q>Every thing that hath breath ſhall praiſe JAH. Hallelujah.</q> Pſalm cl. 6. In this light it is a glorious, certain, and very extenſive prophecy: Words cannot be more univerſal, than <q>
                     <hi>every thing that hath breath:</hi>
                  </q> The word <hi>ſhall</hi> implies the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the accompliſhment of it, and the matter on ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the prophecy is moſt glorious, they ſhall <hi>praiſe</hi> JAH; they ſhall adore their great Creator, with all their hearts and tongues, according to his will, and ſhall give him the glory which is due to his name. And is not this prophecy abſolutely incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with any of God's creatures always continuing his ſors, and remaining in a ſtate of miſery during the whole of their exiſtence?</p>
               <p>But beſides theſe and many other prophecies, the very exhortations with which the book of Pſalms abounds, to all people, nations, and tongues, to praiſe and magnify, adore and bleſs God, are ſtrong arguments to prove the Univerſal Reſtoration: For,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:025049_0021_0FCDAFBFE47C31D8"/>
why are thoſe exhortations given, if they are never to be complied with? And why are all exhorted to praiſe God for his goodneſs, love, mercy, kindneſs, and compaſſion, if they are not all to ſhare in the ſame? Many other paſſages might be produced, and arguments advanced out of this divine book to prove the glorious doctrine true. But my plan will not ſuffer me to enlarge. The hints I have given are ſufficient to ſhew that it is by no means overlooked among the great variety of noble and important ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects treated of therein.</p>
               <p>I come next to conſider ſome of the prophecies of Iſaiah upon this very intereſting ſubject; and as he is commonly called, <hi>The evangelical Prophet,</hi> we may expect if this great event was revealed to any of the prophets, it was to him: And as St. Peter declares that God hath ſpoken of it <hi>by the mouth of all his boly Prophets, ſince the world began,</hi> Acts iii. 21. we may be ſure of ſinding it in his prophecy.</p>
               <p>But I muſt not think of reciting all the intimations that God has been graciouſly pleaſed to give us by the mouth or pen of this ſublime prophet, of his merciful deſigns towards the whole human race; but conſine myſelf to a few of the moſt important.</p>
               <p>The firſt I ſhall quote, is, chap. xxv. 6, 7, 8.— <q>And in this mountain ſhall JEHOVAH of hoſts make unto all people a feaſt of ſat things, a feaſt of wines on the lees; of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the le 3 well reſined. And he will deſtroy in this mountain the face of the covering caſt over all people, and the vail that is ſpread over all nations. He will ſwallow up death in victory; and Adonai JEHOVAH will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people ſhall he take away from off all the earth: for JEHOVAH hath ſpoken it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:025049_0022_0FCDAF87F7CCAEE8"/>This is a very extenſive and important prophecy: it began to be fulfilled at the commencement of the goſpel diſpenſation; is now fulſilling; and will be more fully accompliſhed in the time of the Milleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, when the knowledge of God ſhall be univerſal. But its compleat accompliſhment ſeems to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for that diſpenſation of which I have already treated, the new heaven and earth, when the New Jeruſalem ſhall deſcend, and the tabernacle of God ſhall be with men, and he will dwell with them; and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God; and when God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes; when there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, not crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain; for the former things ſhall be paſſed away; and all things ſhall be made new. It is evident that lſaiah and St. John ſoake of the ſame time or period, and nearly in the ſame words. The Gaſpel feaſt is a rich and noble feaſt, and the bleſſings of it are free for all, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for all, as God has a regard for all, and Chriſt died for all; and the darkneſs and ignorance ſhall be removed from the minds and hearts of all people and nations; death, even all kinds of deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be ſwallowed up in victory; tears ſhall be wiped away from all faces, by the kind and powerful hand of God, who alone can perform a work ſo great and glorious; all weeping, ſorrow, and rebuke ſhall forever ceaſe. This the mouth of JEHOVAH hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and it cannot fail of being accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>Then ſhall be fulfilled another glorious prophecy ſpoken by the ſame prophet, chap. xl. 5. <q>And the glory of JEHOVAH ſhall be revealed, and all fleth ſhall ſee it together: for the mouth of JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH hath ſpoken it.</q> This prophecy like the other is of great latitude and extent: it began to have us accompliſhment, at our Lord's coming forth to the work of the miniſtry, but it cannot be ſaid to be fully accompliſhed till all fleſh, or men, have not
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025049_0023_0FCDAFC285821C48"/>
only beheld the glory or ſalvation of God, but have ſeen it together, which cannot be but in the new earth.</p>
               <p>Then, when Christ ſhall have entirely finiſhed his work as Mediator, all fleſh ſhall behold the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God together, and be made partakers of his ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The next paſſage that I ſhall mention out of this divinely inſpired prophet, is one that I am perſuaded is foundation enough to build the important doctrine upon, even though no other of equal force could be found in ſcripture. Chap. xiv. 22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Look unto me, and be ye ſaved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none elſe. I have ſworn by myſelf, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteouſneſs, and ſhall not return, That unto me every knee ſhall bow, every tongue ſhall ſwear. Surely ſhall <note n="§" place="bottom">The reader may perceive that I have left out two words which the tranſlators have added to compleat the ſenſe, as they ſuppoſed; the ſenſe is compleat without any addition whatever; but the words they added were not full enough to correſpond with the reſt of the text. They have addled the words <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>men,</hi> which as the common reader may ſee, are printed in a different character. The words to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with the reſt of the text ſhould be <hi>every one</hi> or <hi>every tongue;</hi> and <hi>all men,</hi> but leave theſe words out and the ſenſe is the ſame, becauſe the words <hi>every knee</hi> and <hi>every tongue</hi> are expreſſed in verſe 23, and muſt conſequently be underſtood in the 24th verſe.</note> ſaw, In Jehovah have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength: even to him ſhall come; and all that are incenſed againſt him ſhall be aſhamed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this glorious prophecy there is firſt a general invitation given by Jehovah, (whom I take here by the parallel paſſages in the New Teſtament, to be the Son of God, the Saviour of mankind) to all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:025049_0024_0FCDAF8B2C747288"/>
to look to him, and be ſaved: The ends of the earth are invited, and ſalvation is promiſed to all who truly look to the glorious Saviour for ſuch a bleſſing.</p>
               <p>If the common Arminian ſyſtem was the whole truth, no more need to have been added; it would have been enough to have ſaid, <q>There is a general proviſion made for all men; and all the ends of the earth are invited to look to me, and ſuch as look ſhall be ſaved; and as for the reſt they ſhall have their choice, and I ſhall exert myſelf no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their behalf.</q> But the words go much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond an invitation, for that might be given, and yet take no certain effect upon the greater part, as we frequently ſee. But the great Saviour being deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to put an end to all rebellion, and bring every creature to a ſtate of ſubjection and obedience, hath not wholly reſted the matter there, but to put it out of all doubt, hath in the moſt ſolemn manner ſworn by Himſelf, and ſent forth the word from his mouth in righteouſneſs, never to return void, but to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his glorious purpoſes in the moſt abſolute man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. His fixed reſolution is, that every knee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception ſhall bow to him as their Lord; and every tongue ſhall ſwear allegiance and fealty to his righteous and juſt government<note n="*" place="bottom">In the firſt piece that ever I publiſhed upon this delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſubject, I introduced this part of the paſſage, and argned in the following manner upon it; of which I have yet ſeen no cauſe to be aſhamed. <q>If we obſerve the words, we ſhall find that God here promiſeth to bring all creatures to return again to their allegiance;</q> not one ſhall to endleſs eternity remain in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebellion againſt him; for ſwearing to him, plainly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a hearty returning. Therefore. If every knee ſhall bow, and every tongue ſhall ſwear, then not one ſhall remain to all eternity in oppoſition to God. But the firſt is true; therefore alſo the laſt. Thus as long as rebellion againſt God laſts, miſery muſt laſt alſo. But rebellion againſt God will not laſt to all eternity. Neither then will miſery laſt to all eternity. See my Sermon on the Seed of the Woman bruiſing the Serpent's head. Printed in Philadelphia, 1781. page 13.</note>.</p>
               <p>Every knee and every tongue, are words of the moſt ample ſignification, and if they do not intend <hi>all perſons without exception,</hi> it is impoſſible to expreſs
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:025049_0025_0FCDAFC38D393548"/>
that idea by any words in our language. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all allow that the expreſſions here are abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly univerſal and the only diſpute is what the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, bowing the knee, and ſwearing with the tongue intend. Some ſuppoſe that they intend no more than being brought before the bar of Chriſt, and giving up their accounts to the great Saviour and Judge of all men: and it muſt be confeſſed this is evidently included; and the words are cited by St. Paul in his epiſtle to the Romans in that light:— Chap. xiv. 10, 11, 12. <q>But why doſt thou judge thy brother? or why doſt thou ſet at nought thy brother? for we ſhall all ſtand before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of Chriſt. For it is written, As I live. ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall bow to me, and every tongue ſhall confeſs to God. So then every one of us ſhall give account of himſelf to God:</q> This was ſufficient for the apoſtle's purpoſe in the ſubject he was then upon; and we all know from the Scriptures that the diſpenſation of judgment muſt paſs upon all men here or hereafter: And I ſuppoſe, and think I have made it evident, that the judgment of thoſe who do not hearken to the invitations of the goſpel, is one of the means by which the Saviour of mankind will bring his ſoes to ſubmit to him; and if ſo, then the quotation of this text by St. Paul;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:025049_0026_0FCDAF8C0C5E9488"/>
in the fore cited paſſage of the epiſtle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, is ſo far from being contradictory to the ideas I have of the text, that it is perfectly conſiſtent there with. But St. Paul by no means ſuppoſed that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to judgment, and giving account of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God, was the whole meaning of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; for he has cited the ſame paſſage in a much fuller manner in the epiſtle to the Philippians, in which he makes it ſignify much more than being <hi>judged,</hi> even to comprehend hearty ſubmiſſion, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the moſt noble and free confeſſion, for the moſt important purpoſes; for the glory of God the Father, and the honour of the great Redeemer, and I may add, for their own happineſs, according to the language of the prophet. Becauſe Jeſus ſo humbled himſelf as to make himſelf of no reputation, to take upon him the form of a ſervant, and to be made in the likeneſs of men, and being thus degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as to be found in the faſhion of a man, he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf ſtill more, and became obedient unto death; yea, that his humiliation might be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that was poſſible, he ſubmitted to death in its moſt painful and ſhameful, yea, and moſt accurſed form, <hi>the death of the Croſs;</hi> a puniſhment inflicted by the Romans only upon ſlaves, in caſe of the moſt atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious crimes. <q>Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him; and hath given him a name which is above every name; That at (or in) the name of Jeſus, every knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue ſhould confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</q> Phil. ii. 7—11.</p>
               <p>Here the expreſſions are very full and particular, every knee in heaven, earth, and under the earth, ſhall bow, and ſubmit to Jeſus; they ſhall bow in his name, and pay him implicit homage and adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and every tongue ſhall do more than give an account to the Judge—they ſhall confeſs that he is
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:025049_0027_0FCDAFC7ABC809D0"/>
Lord—even their Lord—to the glory of God the Father!</p>
               <p>Every word here uſed ſeems to imply a <hi>willing</hi> and not a <hi>forced ſubjection,</hi> as <hi>bowing in the name of Jeſus, and confeſſing him to be Lord of all, to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God the Father.</hi> There is not the leaſt intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any exception, all ſhall bow and confeſs, and in the ſame manner, even in the name of Jeſus, and for the ſame deſign and end, the glory of God the Father. I can ſee no difference in the text with reſpect to this ſubjection and obedience, between thoſe in heaven, thoſe on earth, and thoſe under the earth; either all are willing and free, or none, for any thing that appears in the text. And indeed I am aſtoniſhed that any can imagine that God can be pleaſed and glorified, and Chriſt rewarded and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, with a forced ſubjection, what would not even pleaſe an earthly monarch. I might ſay in this caſe as God did reſpecting offering the blind, lame, and ſick, <q>Offer it now unto thy governor, will he be pleaſed with thee, or accept thy perſon? ſaith JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH of hoſts.</q> Mal. i. 8. God always requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt excellent things to be offered to him, and in the moſt free and willing manner; and as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the whole heart, mind, and ſtrength, to be free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dedicated to him, it is not likely that he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a nominal, unwilling, and forced ſubjection and ſervice.</p>
               <p>To return to the prophecy of Iſaiah.</p>
               <p>Whatever be the meaning of the words, <q>unto me every knee ſhall bow, and every tongue ſhall ſwear;</q> they ſhall certainly be accompliſhed in the very ſenſe which he intended; yea, they muſt, or the oath of God is made void at once, which would be horrid to ſuppoſe. Even concerning his word he ſaith, <q>For as the rain cometh down, and the ſnow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:025049_0028_0FCDAF8E20A066D8"/>
the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give ſeed to the ſower, and bread to the eater; So ſhall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it ſhall not return unto me void, but it ſhall accompliſh that which I pleaſe, and it ſhall proſper in the thing whereto I ſent it.</q> Iſai. iv. 10, 11. And if the word of God ſhall certainly accompliſh his intention at laſt, none can imagine that his moſt ſolemn oath ſhall be void. The bowing of the knee implies both ſubmiſſion and adoration; and ſwearing fealty and allegiance, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes pardon, reception, and protection, on the part of the monarch; and a hearty returning from rebellion, renouncing all other juriſdiction, true hearty ſubjection, allegiance, and obedience on the part of the rebel. And however kings of the earth may be deceived, and impoſed upon by falſe oaths, feigned ſubmiſſion, and forced unwilling ſubjection, it cannot be the caſe with the great Supreme.</p>
               <p>If this be allowed to be the true meaning of the text, I think the doctrine of the univerſal reſtoration is evident. And if we read and conſider the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going and following words, we ſhall find that <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and not <hi>damnation</hi> ſtands connected with this promiſe and oath of God; he doth not ſwear that they ſhall always remain his enemies, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary that they ſhall become his ſubjects; and that every tongue ſhall not only ſwear, but ſhall ſurely ſay, "In JEHOVAH have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength:" which ſurely is inconſiſtent with endleſs damnation, but perfectly conſiſtent with ſalvation. God does not ſay, <hi>They ſhall never come,</hi> but on the contrary, <hi>To him ſhall come;</hi> and all men are underſtood, by every knee, and every tongue; they ſhall all come to him, and own him their Lord, and declare that in him is their righteouſneſs and ſtrength: and if this doth not imply their ſalvation, I know not what doth; for if looking to him is ſufficient to ſave them, certainly coming to him can do no leſs; and if any
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025049_0029_0FCDAFC9AAFF7628"/>
doubt remained, the univerſal declaration of every tongue, that, "In JEHOVAH have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength;" would be, I think, fully ſufficient to ſet it aſide, and ſhew that all ſhould be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of ſalvation. And as for that expreſſion, that <hi>all that are incenſed againſt him ſhall be aſhamed;</hi> which many ſuppoſe intimates that ſome ſhall be left out, who ſhall not be delivered, but always remain under the power of ſin and ſhame; this may be eaſily, explained by a ſimilar paſſage in Ezek. xvi. where God promiſes to Jeruſalem, that he will remember his covenant, that he made with her in the days of her youth, and that he will eſtabliſh unto her an everlaſting covenant, which is certainly a ſtate of ſalvation and happineſs beyond all diſpute; yet he immediately adds, <q>Then thou ſhalt remember thy ways and be aſhamed, when thou ſhalt receive thy ſiſters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters; but not by thy covenant: And I will eſtabliſh my covenant with thee; and thou ſhalt know that I am JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH; That thou mayeſt remember and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and never open thy mouth any more becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou haſt done, ſaith Adonai JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH.</q> ver. 60, 61, 62, 63.</p>
               <p>Here it is plainly ſeen that a certain ſenſe of ſhame and confuſion of face, in thoſe who have been guilty of high rebellion againſt the God of love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when they come to be made ſenſible of it, and to have a manifeſtation of pardon and forgiveneſs, is perfectly conſiſtent with a ſtate of happineſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. Thus a ſenſe of ſhame, is ſo far from making ſalvation void, that it is conſiſtent with God's being entirely pacified towards them for all that they have done, and with their being joined to him in an everlaſting covenant.</p>
               <p>I might add much more upon this important pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:025049_0030_0FCDAF8F08077B20"/>
of Iſaiah, but having dwelt long upon it, I muſt paſs on, to other paſſages, deſerving our notice.</p>
               <p>This ſame inſpired writer makes the death of Chriſt and his juſtifying grace of equal extent, <q>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH hath laid on him the iniquity of us all;</q> even all of us who like ſheep have gone aſtray, and have turned every one to his own way. <q>He ſhall ſee of the travail of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied: by his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtify many (or the many); for he ſhall bear their iniquities,</q> Chap. liii. 6, 11.</p>
               <p>It is plain that our Lord will not finally loſe his labour, nor ſhed his blood in vain. The Prophet declared as poſitively that he ſhould juſtify the <hi>many,</hi> as that he ſhould <hi>bear their iniquities.</hi> And what the Prophet foretold, the Apoſtle confirmed in that prophetic chapter, Rom. v. which may be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the beſt comment upon this text that has ever been written. Therein he declares that, <q>As by the offence of one, Judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all men to juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life.</q> ver. 18.</p>
               <p>But perhaps ſome might ſay, This is only general proviſion, and there is no certainty that they ſhall ever become actual partakers of it. To prevent this, and to teſtify the univerſal reſtoration in the plaineſt manner, he adds, <q>For as by one man's diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of one ſhall many be made righteous.</q>—ver. 19 Here he aſſerts, not only that all who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came corrupted and condemned by the offence of one, have a proviſion made for their juſtification and happineſs in Chriſt, but that they ſhall as certainly become righteous at laſt, as they have been actually ſinners. So God hath greatly purpoſed, and his will muſt be done. And to confirm us, if poſſible,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:025049_0031_0FCDAFCD0AC30910"/>
ſtill more in this idea, the great Apoſtle ſays, <q>Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where ſin abounded grace did much more abound.</q> ver. 20. Here the Apoſtle ſpeaks like a Prophet, in the ſame grand and glorious ſtile; he ſpeaks of things not yet come to paſs, as though they were already fulfilled, to ſhew the abſolute cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of their accompliſhment, So God ſpake to Abraham, <q>A father of many nations have I made thee.</q> Gen. xvii. 5.—Rom. iv. 17. Though at that time Iſaac was not born; but he was a father of many nations <q>before him whom he believed, even God who quickeneth the dead, and calleth thoſe things that be not, as though they were.</q> So Iſaiah ſays, <q>Unto us a child is born, unto us a ſon is given,</q> &amp;c. Iſai. ix. 6. And hundreds of paſſages might be found of the like nature in the ſacred writings, which we muſt never interpret by mood and tenſe, and ſuch-like little criticiſms.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle to the Hebrews ſays, <q>Thou haſt put all things in ſubjection under his feet. For in that he put all in ſubjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we ſee not yet all things put under him.</q> Heb. ii. 8. And the ſame reaſoning may be applied to the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abounding of grace over ſin; it is done in the ſight of God, it certainly ſhall be compleatly performed at laſt, but we do not yet behold it; far from it; ſin has hitherto abounded much more than grace; but the ſcale will turn, and grace ſhall abound much more than ſin <note n="†" place="bottom">From this text alone an argument may be drawn in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the univerſal reſtoration that cannot eaſily be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and as it has ſtood in my printed works for nine years, without ever having been fairly anſwered, I will take the liberty of tranſcribing it here. <q>It is evident that ſin has abounded to the deſtruction of all men; now if grace abounds <hi>much more,</hi> it is evident that all muſt be at laſt reſtored thereby; otherwiſe there is no ſhadow of truth in the words. Therefore if grace ſhall abound more than ſin, it muſt be as extenſive; and more powerful: But the firſt is true: therefore the laſt alſo.</q> Sermon on the Seed of the Woman bruiſing the Serpent's head. Philadelphia, 1781.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:025049_0032_0FCDAF93DE1F5590"/>
But as though St. Paul was determined that none ſhould remain ignorant of the matter that ſhould read this epiſtle, he farther adds, <q>That as ſin hath reigned unto death, even ſo might grace reign through righteouſneſs unto eternal life, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</q> ver. 21.</p>
               <p>Many will allow that Chriſt's redemption is ſo far for all men as to give them the bleſſing of temporal life; but St. Paul here declares that grace ſhall <hi>reign to eternal life,</hi> even as ſin hath <hi>reigned unto death:</hi> and none will deny but ſin hath certainly reigned unto death over all men: (however differently they may explain the word <hi>death</hi>) then grace muſt reign through righteouſneſs, unto eternal life, over all men.</p>
               <p>Chriſt muſt ſee of the travail of his ſoul, and muſt be fully ſatisfied and contented; and who can tell how capacious the ſoul of Chriſt is? He will not, muſt not, cannot loſe the ſouls of men, whom the father gave him; whom he redeemed with his own precious blood; and whom he hath engaged to bring back to God again. For ſuch is the will of the Father that ſent him, and it muſt be done at laſt.</p>
               <p>If it can be proved from Scripture that the Father hath not given all the race of men into the hands of Chriſt, and that he hath not ſhed his blood for all; then I will give up the reſtoration of all; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

I cannot, unleſs I renounce the preſent ideas I have of the prophecies; and I have no reaſon to do that from paſt events; and I ſhall reſt a while to ſee how things go on, before I give up, what I truſt I have learned from the holy ſcriptures. I cannot think otherwiſe but what God will fulfil the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that are yet to be accompliſhed, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he has thoſe which have been already brought to paſs.</p>
               <p>I ſhall notice but one more prophecy in the book of Iſaiah, in favour of the Univerſal Reſtoration; and that (one would think) is enough to convince any unprejudiced mind, that wrath towards all God's creatures, is limited, and muſt at length have an end.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the ſpirit ſhould fail before me, and the ſouls which I have made.</q> chap. lvii. 10</p>
               <p>Here is a general declaration, that God will not contend for ever, neither be always wroth; and for this he gives a plain reaſon, founded in his love and pity towards the works of his hands; <hi>the ſpirit ſhould fail before me, and the ſouls that I have made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall treat very briefly upon this text, becauſe I have dwelt ſo long upon thoſe which I have already conſidered.</p>
               <p>Some may ſay, that God only ſpeaks of his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people, that he will not contend with them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, nor be always wroth with his choſen. But it is evident that he ſpeaks of ſuch who went on frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly in the way of their own hearts; whoſe ways he ſaw, and promiſed to heal them, and to reſtore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts unto them, and to their mourners. And the reaſon he gives why he will not contend for ever, nor be always wroth, is general, and founded upon the relation that God ſtands in to his creatures as
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:025049_0034_0FCDAF991E79A6A8"/>
their Creator and Father. And as he is the Father of all ſpirits, and Creator of all ſouls, the ſame reaſon in this reſpect ſubſiſts towards all alike. And it is worthy of our notice, that no reaſon is given in this text, why he will not contend for ever, not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wroth, but what equally applies to one as well as another. And I ſay now, as I have ſaid more than once in my writings, <q>Thoſe who venture to contradict their Maker in this aſſertion, and ſay, that he <hi>will contend forever, and will be always wroth,</hi> ought to be able at leaſt to aſſign as good a reaſon for it, as he has to the contrary, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently prove him not to be the univerſal Maker and Father of mankind.</q> This would be doing the work effectually, and would lay ſuch a firm foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the doctrine of endleſs miſery, as could not eaſily be overthrown. But as this can never be done by Scripture. I think we may affirm with the utmoſt certainty, according to this prophecy, that God will not contend with his creatures for ever, nor be always wroth with them; leſt the ſpirit ſhould fail before him, and the ſouls which he hath made. And this text concludes as ſtrongly againſt annihilation or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as it does againſt endleſs damnation: For in either caſe the ſpirit muſt fail for ever of attaining to the end for which God deſigned it, and it crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be in vain, and to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Truth is, that God will ſubdue <hi>All;</hi> bring every knee to bow, and tongue to ſwear; and thus as all ſhall ſubmit to him, become reconciled to his government, and obedient to his laws, all contention ſhall ceaſe; which cannot be the caſe till all creatures yield to their Creator, as he will never give up any of his rights.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thy mercy, O JEHOVAH, endureth for ever: forſake not the works of thine own hands.</q> Pſalm cxxxviii. 8. It is a great conſolation to think that God's mercy endures for ever; and that he will have
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:025049_0035_0FCDAFD1549CD330"/>
a deſire to the works of his hands, and will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, until he hath performed all his pleaſure, in them and for them; which ſhall iſſue in his own glory, and their felicity.</p>
               <p>I ſhall dwell no longer on the prophecy of Iſaiah: for though there are many other paſſages therein that intimate the Univerſal Reſtoration, ſome of which I have noticed already in this work, yet as other parts of Scripture demand our attention, I ſhall paſs to mention ſome of the moſt material prophecies that are yet to be conſidered reſpecting this moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant event. For though I conſider the texts already cited as ſufficient of themſelves to prove the doctrine of the Reſtoration true, yet it muſt give great pleaſure and ſatisfaction to the friends of this glorious ſyſtem, to ſee a point of this amazing magnitude confirmed by a great number of paſſages.</p>
               <p>The prophecy of Jeremiah has not very much in it that appears to me directly to relate to this ſubject. He may be called, <hi>The mourning prophet.</hi> His book is chiefly filled with accounts of black crimes, and dreadful judgments; nevertheleſs there are four or five chapters that contain many very gracious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; yet as they chiefly and moſt directly relate to the happy ſtate of Judah and Iſrael in the time of the Millenium, and have been conſidered in that light, I ſhall paſs them over here. For as the Millenium itſelf ſhall in many inſtances be a beautiful type and figure of the New Earth, and final happy ſtate of mankind, and the glorious recovery of the twelve tribes ſhall be a picture of the general reſtoration, the ſame promiſes that confirm the former may in many inſtances be applied to the latter event.</p>
               <p>That declaration of God by Jeremiah, Chap. iii. 12, <q>For I am merciful, ſaith JEHOVAH, and I will not keep anger for ever:</q> has been already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned among other paſſages of the ſame nature; and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:025049_0036_0FCDAF9B0A3F13D0"/>
well deſerves a place here, for it is like the ſun ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a cloud.</p>
               <p>And ſomething of the ſame kind appears in the book of lamentations, where we ſhould leaſt expect it. <q>For JEHOVAH will not caſt off for ever. But though he cauſe grief, yet will he have compaſſion according to the multitude of his mercies: For he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men.</q> Lam. iii. 31, 32, 33.</p>
               <p>Theſe words appear to me, to be without limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time, or perſons. God never afflicts willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor grieves the children of men in any ſtage of their exiſtence. Why then doth he afflict and grieve them at all? The anſwer is, It is neceſſary for their good. This, if admitted as true, ſettles the point at once; for if God always afflicts the children of men for their good and never merely for his own pleaſure then the doctrine of the Reſtoration is true. And would it not be abſurd to ſay, That although God doth not willingly afflict and grieve the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men in this life, but doth all for their good; yet as ſoon as they depart into another ſtate of exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he afflicts them in the ſevereſt manner, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and takes pleaſure in putting them to the utmoſt torture, without having the leaſt eye to their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage? But if it be univerſally true, that he <hi>will not caſt eff for ever;</hi> but although he may cauſe grief and ſorrow for a time, yet finally he <hi>will have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, according to the multitude of his mercies,</hi> then there is a glorious deſign, even in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that deſign can be no other than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming and reſtoring his fallen creatures.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral threatenings and promiſes made to the ſome people and nations in the prophecy of Jeremiah, that I could never reconcile together upon any other plan than the general Reſtoration: If any perſon can do it, I am ready to receive light. I will
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:025049_0037_0FCDAFD34D4625C8"/>
juſt mention them, and ſhew wherein the difficulty lies, and leave them to your conſideration.</p>
               <p>Jer. xlviii. 42. <q>Moab ſhall be deſtroyed from being a people, becauſe he hath magnified himſelf againſt JEHOVAH.</q> This ſeems to be a threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their total deſtruction from off the face of the earth: and this is repeated more particularly, and confirmed in the moſt ſolemn and awful manner by God, in the prophecy of Zephaniah, chap. ii. 8, 9. <q>I have heard of the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themſelves againſt their border. Therefore as I live, ſaith JEHOVAH of hoſts, the God of Iſrael, ſurely Moab ſhall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and ſalt-pits, and a perpetual deſolation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This threatening has been executed, and neither the name or nation of Moab or Ammon is to be found on earth, having been totally deſtroyed, This is conſiſtent with Jer. xlvi. 28. <q>Fear thou not, O Jacob my ſervant, ſaith JEHOVAH:: for I am with thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee; but I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in meaſure;</q> &amp;c. Here you ſee the diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Iſrael and other nations, they were to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut off, to be utterly deſtroyed: a full end was to be made of them, not to Jacob; a ſeed and remnant had a promiſe of being ſpared and preſerved.</p>
               <p>But theſe ſame nations of Moab and Ammen that are thus threatened with total and final deſtruction, and who do not exiſt on earth at preſent, are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a reſtoration, and return of their captivity in the latter days, <q>Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab, in the latter days, faith JEHOVAH,</q> Jer. xlviii. 47.— <q>And afterwards I will bring again
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:025049_0038_0FCDAF9CF4FF98B0"/>
the captivity of the children of Ammon, faith JEHOVAH.</q> chap. xlix. 6.</p>
               <p>The ſame threatnings and promiſes are made to Elam, <q>I will cauſe Elam to be diſmayed before their enemies, and before them that ſeek their life; and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, ſaith JEHOVAH: and I will ſend the ſword after them, till I have conſumed them.</q> chap. xlix. 37. Here is a full declaration of their being totally conſumed from the face of the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But it ſhall come to paſs in the latter days that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, ſaith JEHOVAH.</q> ver. 39.</p>
               <p>Now if any can ſhew how the captivity of nations that long ago have entirely periſhed from the earth can be returned in the latter days, unleſs the ſyſtem of the new earth and the reſtoration be true, I ſhould for one be glad to be informed of it. In the mean time, as I cannot ſee how theſe promiſes can be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled reſpecting Moab, Ammon and Elam, (as it is evident they never yet have been) unleſs their reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the manner I have laid it down is true; ſo I can ſee no reaſon why theſe three nations ſhould be diſtinguiſhed from the reſt that have in like manner periſhed; and therefore I conclude that they are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as ſpecimens and examples, and that the whole ſhall be ſharers together of the future reſtoration and deliverance, even as they have ſhared together in puniſhment and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>But the moſt remarkable prophecy of this kind is found in Ezekiel, chap. xvi. where God ſpeaks of the ſins of Sodom, and her daughters, the cities of the plain: and mentions that he took them away, as he ſaw good, by fire and brimſtone from heaven; which was a fact well known through the world at the time it happened, and was a dreadful warning to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:025049_0039_0FCDAFD54A998428"/>
all nations to avoid ſin. The ſins of Sodom and her daughters, are compared with the ſins of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem and her daughters, and the crimes of the latter are found far to exceed, both in number and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and being committed gainſt greater light and love, were much more aggravated. Yet God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to bring again the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, the cities of the plan; Samaria and-her daughters, the cities of Iſrael; and Jeruſalem and her daughters, the cities of Judah, at the ſame time, and that they ſhould embrace each other in the arms of love and ſincere affection. And akhough the idea of the reſtoration of the perſons of Samaria and Jeruſalem might be evaded, by ſaying that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of their deſcendants was intended, yet no ſuch evaſion can be uſed reſpecting Sodom and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as they were wholly deſtroyed by fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and none of them eſcaped, and conſequently not one of their deſcendants is now on earth. The reſtoration of thoſe very perſons of Sodom. &amp;c. who were deſtroyed, being here intended, (for what elſe can poſſibly be meant?) we are obliged to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the return of the captivity of Jeruſalem and Samaria here mentioned, in the ſame manner, for the reſtoration of thoſe very ſinners of thoſe cities, who were deſtroyed and cut off for their great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions; or elſe how can they know, receive, and delight in each other?</p>
               <p>This glorious return of their captivity as deſcribed in this chapter, I refer to the new earth; after the judgment, and conflagration, and the ages of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are paſt. Then all the nations of the old earth ſtill become inhabitants of the new, and their long captivity under the worſt of tyrants, ſin, death, hell and pain, ſhall be returned in the higheſt and beſt ſenſe of the words; which is indeed the only fair and reaſonable ſenſe, as far as I can ſee, that can be put upon the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:025049_0040_0FCDAF9F692B8D00"/>I might ſay much more here, but as my deſign is to diſcourſe upon theſe very remarkable predictions of Ezekiel reſpecting Sodom, Samaria, and Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and their daughters by themſelves, I ſhall ſay no more upon that ſubject now, but ſhall refer you to the words of the prophecy. Ezek. xvi. 44—63 And if after reading and attentively conſidering the matter, you can make any thing elſe to be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words ſo as to hold and run through the whole in harmony and perfect conſiſtency, then you will perform a taſk to which I have never yet found any perſon equal, whether by word or writing; and, from what I have ſeen hitherto, I am ready to judge is morally impoſſible.</p>
               <p>Ezekiel has many wonderful paſſages, wherein the greateſt mercies are promiſed to ſucceed the moſt terrible judgments, and many wherein it is expreſsly intimated that the end and great deſign of God in all the deſtructions threatened is, <hi>that they might know</hi> JEHOVAH; and this being a ſalutary and ſaving knowledge, I take all thoſe paſſages as proofs of the final reſtoration of thoſe who are thus deſtroyed on purpose, ſeemingly, that they might know the Lord. (See in this light Pſal. ixxxiii. and the obſervations which I have made upon the ſame.)</p>
               <p>But as I have taken notice of many of theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages already in the courſe of the Lectures, and as this diſcourſe has been already long, and I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing yet to add to it, I ſhall take my leave for the preſent of this excellent Prophet, whoſe prophecies have afforded me abundance of delight and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Daniel's prophecy is the next that we come to: he ſpeaks of the kingdom which Chriſt ſhall receive of the Father, <q>And there was given him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages ſhould ſerve him; his dominion
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:025049_0041_0FCDAFD677535C50"/>
is an everlaſting dominion, which ſhall not paſs away, and his kingdom that which ſhall not be deſtroyed. The ſaints of the Moſt High ſhall take the kingdom, and poſſeſſ the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever. And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatneſs of the kingdom under the whole heaven ſhall be given to the people of the ſaints of the Moſt High; whoſe kingdom is an everlaſting kingdom, and all dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him.</q> Dan. vii. 14, 18, 27.</p>
               <p>The Prophet declares that all people, nations and languages ſhall ſerve the glorious Meſſiah, when he ſhall come in glory, and that the ſaints ſhall poſſes the kingdom <hi>for ever,</hi> or for an age, which ſhall be in the Millenium, when they ſhall reign with Chriſt a thouſand years; <hi>even for ever and ever,</hi> or for ages of ages; theſe periods carry us far beyond the Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, even to the new earth, where Chriſt and his ſaints ſhall reign together for ages of ages, before the kingdom ſhall be delivered up to the Father, that God may be all in all. And during the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of this kingdom, all adverſe powers muſt be brought into ſubjection, for Chriſt muſt reign till all his enemies are put under his feet. See Rev. xxii. 5. compared with 1 Cor. xv. 24—28. And as the deſign of this kingdom of ages, after the judgment, is to reſtore and make all things new, (as I have ſhewn,) therefore theſe prophecies of Daniel muſt be underſtood to reach to that glorious period when God ſhall be all in all, <hi>and all dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him.</hi> And this to me appears to include their return to God and goodneſs, and conſequently to happineſs.</p>
               <p>Hoſea is a wonderful prophet to reconcile Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and mercy together; the moſt dreadful threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings are denounced againſt the ſame people and perſons to whom afterwards the greateſt promiſes are made. This in my opinion, can only be reconciled
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:025049_0042_0FCDAFA5474BB0E8"/>
upon the ſuppoſition that judgement ſhall be finally ſucceeded by mercy. To one that never read the prophet Hoſea with this view, his writing muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a continued chain of contradictions.</p>
               <p>In the firſt chapter God ſays, <q>I will no more have mercy upon the houſe of Iſrael. Ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.</q> ver. 6, 9. Yet directly after it is added, <q>And it ſhall come to paſs that in the place where it was ſaid unto them, Ye are not my people, there it ſhall be ſaid unto them, Ye are the ſons of the living God.</q> ver. 10.</p>
               <p>By the threatenings we ſhould conclude that no mercy could poſſibly reach them, but when we turn our attention to the promiſes we ſee cauſe to change our mind.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond chapter God promiſes to betroth thoſe to him for ever, whom before he declared that he had caſt entirely off, yea, to betroth them in righteouſneſs, and in judgment, and in loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in mercies; yea, even to betroth them to himſelf in faithfulneſs, and to give them to know him, whom to know is life eternal: And farther he ſays, <q>And I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will ſay to them who were not my people, Thou art my people, and they ſhall ſay, Thou art my God.</q> See ver. 19, 20.23. And the apoſtle explains this as conſtituting them heirs of ſalvation, and veſſels of mercy, on whom he would make the riches of his glory known, though before they had been veſſels of wrath: and to this purpoſe he quotes theſe very paſſages, ſaying, <q>As he faith in Oſee, I will call them My people, who were not my people; and her Beloved, who was not beloved. And it ſhall come to paſs, that in the place where it was ſaid unto them, Ye are not my people; there ſhall they be called The
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:025049_0043_0FCDAFDB107DC570"/>
children of the living God.</q> Rom. ix. 25, 26. And conſequently thoſe ſame perſons who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſhall become heirs of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>In chap. iv. 17. it is ſaid, <q>Ephraim is joined to idols, let him alone.</q> This looks dark, as though God had left Ephraim to himſelf to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally undone.</p>
               <p>In the vth chapter, it is ſaid, <q>And the pride of Iſrael, doth teſtify to his face: therefore ſhall Iſrael and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah alſo ſhall fall with them. They ſhall go with their ſlocks and their herds to ſeek JEHOVAH; but they ſhall not find him; he hath withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from them.</q> ver. 5, 6. There would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear little or no hope of the recovery of thoſe who ſhall fall in their iniquity, and who ſhall ſeek JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH and ſhall not find him, from whom he hath withdrawn himſelf. And the threatening is expreſſed in a ſtill more terrible manner towards the cloſe of the chapter, <q>For I will be unto Ephraim as lion, and as a young lion to the houſe of Judah: I even I will tear and go away, I will take away, and none ſhall reſcue him</q> ver. 14. Who would not be ready to conclude from this verſe, that certainly theſe people were undone and loſt for ever? and eſpecially ſince God by the ſame prophet ſays, <q>Yea, woe alſo to them when I depart from them!</q> Chap. ix. 12. Inevitable and eternal deſtruction, would ſeem their portion, and that God once departed in ſuch an awful manner, would never return again. But the 15th verſe of the vth chapter, changes the ſcene, declares the intention of God in withdrawing himſelf, and ſhews plainly that it is only for a time, till the divine purpoſe therein ſhall be fulfilled. <q>I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and ſeek my face: in their affliction they will ſeek me early.</q> This paſſage diſpels the gloom, and ſhews thst God has a deſign in all his
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:025049_0044_0FCDAFA650710BA0"/>
judgments, even to bring offenders to feel and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge themſelves guilty, and to ſeek his face; then his mercy ſhall be diſplayed, and he will return to them again with his loving favour.</p>
               <p>This is the conſtant tenor of the book, all the way through: but I muſt only mention ſome of the moſt ſtriking paſſages.</p>
               <p>Chap. vii. 13. <q>Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: deſtruction unto them! becauſe they have tranſgreſſed againſt me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have ſpoken lies againſt me,</q> This paſſage (as well as moſt others in this prophecy) repreſents them as the moſt wicked apoſtates, and abandoned ſinners, and that deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was their certain portion; and in chap. x. 8. the Lord ſays, <q>And they ſhall ſay to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.</q> And yet, O how kindly does God ſpeak of this ſame people in chap. xi. even when he had their baſeſt tranſgreſſions full in view? <q>And my people are bent to backſliding from me: though they called them to the Moſt High, none at all would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt him.</q> This was very grievous, and highly provoking; but what are the next words? <q>How ſhall I give thee up, Ephraim? how ſhall I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee, Iſrael? how ſhall I make thee as Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah? how ſhall I ſet thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together. I will not execute the fierceneſs of mine anger, I will not return to deſtroy Ephraim: for I am God and not man; the Holy One in the midſt of thee.</q> ver. 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>In Chap. xiii. God ſets forth his loving kindneſſes towards them, then their great ingratitude and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and then he threatens them in the moſt ſevere and dreadful manner, and then immediately promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to help, heal, recover, ranſom, and reſtore them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:025049_0045_0FCDAFDD0050E308"/>
—<q>Yet I am JEROYAH, thy God, from the land of Egypt, and thou ſhalt know no God but me: for there is no ſaviour beſide me. I did know thee in the wilderneſs, in the land of great drought. According to their paſture, ſo were they filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me. Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I obſerve them. I will meet them as a bear bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the caul of their heart. and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beaſt ſhall tear them.</q> ver. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Words can hardly be more terrible: the threatenings are of the moſt dreadful kind, and we ſhould be apt to think it impoſſible that any help or deliverance could ever be found for a people ſo ſinful, and whom God ſeems engaged utterly to deſtroy, and that without remedy. Yet the very next words, are kind expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of grace and mercy, and afford hopes of help and ſalvation, <q>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but in me is thine help. I will be thy king: where is any other that may ſave thee in all thy cities?</q> ver. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>Now how are theſe promiſes conſiſtent with the threatenings immediately before, unleſs the doctrine of the reſtoration be true? how is it poſſible that both can be accompliſhed upon any other ſyſtem? yet both moſt be fulfilled, one as well as the other; or elſe they are not equally alike true.</p>
               <p>The ſtate of Ephraim is again repreſented as moſt deſperate and deplorable, inſomuch that death and hell, or entire deſtruction, muſt be their inevitable portion; <q>The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his ſin is hid. The ſorrows of a travailing woman ſhall come upon him: he is an unwiſe ſon; for he ſhould not ſtay long in the place of the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of children.</q> ver. 12, 13. Nothing can be more finely imagined to ſet forth the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:025049_0046_0FCDAFA7CA54A740"/>
condition of thoſe who are confirmed in their ſins, and who have trifled away their time, and fooliſhly neglected the ſeaſon of grace, wherein they might have been delivered, and as it were borne out of ſin and miſery, into a ſtate of peace and ſelicity; they are compared to children who have come to the birth, but who by not coming forth in time, periſh and die without remedy. Yet even this ſtate of Ephraim ſhall not fruſtrate the divine counſels; though death and hell have ſwallowed them up as their lawful prey; and they to all human appearance are gone for ever, beyond the reach of mercy or hope. But what ſays God? <q>I will ranſom them from the power of the grave,</q> (or hell, the original word being the ſame for both) <q>I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues, O grave, (or hell) I will be thy deſtruction: repentance ſhall be hid from mine eyes.</q> ver. 14.</p>
               <p>Here we find that inſtead of death and hell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Ephraim for ever, as we might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the preceding words, God declares that he will finally ranſom Ephraim from the power of hell, and will redeem them from all that bears the lateful name of <hi>death;</hi> and to put the matter cut of all doubt, and to ſhew that it is his intention to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver all from theſe tyrants, he promiſes, to deſtroy them without repentance, that ſo they may never be able to receive or hold any more captives. When this prophecy ſhall be fulfilled, <q>There ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain:</q> all things ſhall be made new, and God ſhall wipe away all tears from off all faces, and death of every kind ſhall be wholly ſwallowed up of victory. See Rev. xxi. 4, 5. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Iſaiah xxv. 8. 1 Cor. xv. 54, 55.</p>
               <p>Then God ſhall ſay of Ephraim, <q>I will heal their backſliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.</q> Hoſea xiv. 4.

O glorious period, when wrath ſhall no more be known: when the boundleſs ocean of the free love of God ſhall overflow all his creatures, even thoſe who have been the moſt ſtubborn and rebellious!— <q>Who is wiſe, and he ſhall underſtand theſe things? prudent, and he ſhall know them?</q> ver. 9. Theſe are things worthy of being underſtood and known; are of the greateſt importance to all mankind, tend to the declarative glory of God, and the comfort and conſolation of all that love their fellow creatures.</p>
               <p>Thus far I have juſt run over the larger prophecies on this moſt bleſſed ſubject. I think enough has been advanced to prove the certainty of God's inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion finally to reſtore all mankind; and though much more might be added, I ſhall for bear at preſent, and conclude with the beautiful words of the prophet Micah, chap. vii. 18, 19.—</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his heritage? He retaineth not his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in mercy. He will turn again, he will have compaſſion upon us; he will ſubdue our iniquities; and thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depths of the ſea.</q>

                  <hi>LECTURE II.</hi> New Teſtament prophecies in favour of the doctrine of the Univerſal Reſtoration.</head>
               <p>IN the laſt Lecture I ranged over the prophecies of the Old Teſtament in favour of the General Reſtoration, as far as the prophecy of Hoſea. I had intended to give a ſketch of it from the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of all God's holy prophets, by whoſe mouth St. Peter aſſures us, that God hath ſpoken of the Reſtitution of all things ever ſince the world began. Acts iii. 21.</p>
               <p>But paſſing over the reſt of the minor prophets, without any obſervations upon what they have ſaid reſpecting this important ſubject, I ſhall come im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the writings of the evangeliſts and apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of our Lord, and attend to what they and their Maſter have declared on this head. But let me here advertiſe you, that you are not to expect that I ſhall conſider all that the New Teſtament writers have advanced in favour of it, but only thoſe paſſages which I conſider is propherical, to which I ſhall briefly attend.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:025049_0049_0FCDAFE60A87B978"/>
The firſt prophecy that we meet with on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is St. Matt. i. 21. <q>And ſhe ſhall bring forth a ſon, and thou ſhall call his name JESUS, for be ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This all-benignant prophecy is a counterpart to Gen. iii. 15. We find one at the beginning of the Old Teſtament, and the other at the beginning of the New. Theſe two paſſages are the foundation ſtones of the great doctrine of ſalvation; and all other prophecies reſpecting this matter, are but larger comments and explications of them. We ſee by comparing theſe texts together, that the <hi>Seed of the Woman,</hi> and the <hi>Virgin's Son,</hi> are the ſame perſon, and JESUS is the Saviour's name. One prophecy declares that <hi>He ſhall bruiſe the Serpent's head,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the devil and his works: and the other, that <hi>He ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If all men are his people, and the ſheep of his paſture, and the purchaſe of his blood, and were given to him by the Father, then this prophecy is plainly and fully to the purpoſe, and clearly proves the final reſtoration and deliverance of all men from their ſins, and of courſe from their miſeries; and ſhall as certainly be abſolutely fulfilled as any predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ever juſtified by its correſponding event.</p>
               <p>Need I ſpend time here, to prove that all men are the people of our Lord and Saviour, in all theſe reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects? <q>All things were made by him; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him was not any thing made that was made. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</q>. St. John i. 3.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>God created all things by Jeſus Chriſt.</q> Epheſ. iii. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, viſible, and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:025049_0050_0FCDAFE7B89031B0"/>
whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him.</q> Col. i. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>God hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom alſo he conſtituted the ages. Who being the brightneſs of his glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himſelf purged our ſins, ſat down on the right hand of the Majeſty on high.</q> Heb. i. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>It appears to me from theſe paſſages, that if crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and preſervation can make it proper for Chriſt to call all mankind his people, then they all are his people, in theſe reſpects, at leaſt.</p>
               <p>And if this be denied by any who think lower of JESUS than I do, and who may ſay, that the works of creation and providence ought not to be aſcribed to him in any ſenſe, yet they will allow that the Father was proprietor of all things; and if he gave, or giveth them to his Son Jeſus Chriſt, they are nevertheleſs truly and properly his. Let us view the Scriptures on this head, and we ſhall have reaſon to acknowledge that all men are certainly the people of Jeſus; and conſequently he ſhall ſave all mankind from their ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>All things are delivered unto me of my Father.</q> St. Matt. xi. 27. St. Luke, x. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Father loveth the Son, and he hath given all things into his hand.</q> St. John, iii. 35.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Jeſus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God.</q> chap. xiii. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:025049_0051_0FCDAFE9209D2AB8"/>
                  <q>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him.</q> chap. xvii. 2.</p>
               <p>Theſe paſſages all relate to the ſame thing: there is indeed ſome little difference in the expreſſions: but as the words <hi>delivered</hi> and <hi>given,</hi> are perfectly ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous, as all muſt allow, there can be no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the meaning. All things are given into the hands of JESUS; they were preſented to him by the Father, and he hath univerſal power over them. <hi>All men</hi> are certainly included in the expreſſion <hi>all things;</hi> though <hi>all things</hi> may include much more than <hi>all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that all men are the people of JESUS, as they are given him by the Father, and delivered into his gracious hands for the beſt of purpoſes and as he has power given him over them all: as he himſelf ſays, <q>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</q> St. Matt. xxviii. 18.</p>
               <p>All men are Chriſt's people, inaſmuch as he took part of the common fleſh and blood of all; and thus the birth of Jeſus was good news to all, and was ſo proclaimed by the angel. <q>Fear not: for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, who is Chriſt the Lord. Glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace, good will towards men.</q> St. Luke ii. 10, 11, 14.</p>
               <p>If all men were not intereſted in the ſalvation of Chriſt, how could his birth be good news of great joy to all people?</p>
               <p>But there is another ſenſe in which all men are the people of JESUS. He died for all, and purchaſed them with his own precious blood, which he freely
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:025049_0052_0FCDAFEEBAE5FCD8"/>
ſhed on the croſs for their redemption; as is evident from the following plain texts.</p>
               <bibl>2 Cor. v. 14, 15.</bibl>
               <q>For the love of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth us; becauſe we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: And he died for all, that they who live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him who died for them and roſe again.</q>
               <bibl>1 Tim. ii. 5, 6.</bibl>
               <q>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus; Who gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time.</q>
               <bibl>Heb. ii. 2.</bibl>
               <q>But we ſee Jeſus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the ſuffering of death, crowned with glory and honour: that he by the grace of God ſhould taſte death for every man.</q>
               <bibl>1 John, ii. 1, 2.</bibl>
               <q>And if any man ſin we have an advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous: And he is the propitiation for our ſins: and not for our's only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world.</q>
               <p>Chriſt having bought all men with his own blood, they are not their own, they belong to him, who died for their ſins, and was raiſed again for their juſtification.</p>
               <p>All men are the people of JESUS, foraſmuch as he maketh interceſſion for all, is engaged in their cauſe, and intereſts himſelf in their behalf.</p>
               <p>Thus in all theſe inſtances all men are the people of Jeſus, and therefore if this prophecy be true, he ſhall ſave all men from their ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="unknown:025049_0053_0FCDAFF257111B08"/>He ſhall ſave his people from their ſins. But all men are his people: Therefore he ſhall ſave all men from their ſins.</p>
               <p>I have taken ſome pains in the conſideration of this prophecy of the angel, as it is very important; and if I have proved my premiſes, the conſequences are evident.</p>
               <p>The next prophecy that I ſhall notice under this head, is that of our bleſſed Saviour, who was the greateſt Prophet that ever ſpake to men; and whoſe words are all words of the greateſt truth, and cannot fail of being accompliſhed at laſt.</p>
               <p>St. John, vi. 37, 38, 39. <q>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me. And this is the Father's will who hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It hath been before proved, from the plaineſt texts, that all things were given to Chriſt and delivered to him of the Father; and here he declares that all ſhall come to him in ſuch a manner as not to be caſt out. And that as the Father, on the one hand, hath given him all, ſo on the other hand, he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to bring all back to God again, according to his will. And he aſſures us that the will of the Father is that of all which he hath given to his Son, he ſhould loſe nothing; and as the Saviour came down from heaven to perform this will of the Father, there can be no doubt but it ſhall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed at laſt.</p>
               <p>As for the ſmall variation of the words from <hi>given</hi> to <hi>giveth,</hi> of which ſome would fain take advantage,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:025049_0054_0FCDAFF44E1915C8"/>
as though Chriſt did not mean juſt the ſame here, by <hi>giveth,</hi> as where he uſed the words <hi>given</hi> and <hi>deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> it is nothing to the purpoſe; for as the ſenſe is perfectly the ſame, and differs only in the timing of the verb, it ſhews the weakneſs of the cauſe which depends upon ſuch criticiſms. For whether the words, <hi>giveth, hath given,</hi> or <hi>ſhall give,</hi> are uſed, the ſenſe is the ſame; for the prophets frequently ſubſtitute one tenſe for another, as has been ſhewn in many inſtances; the <hi>preſent</hi> for the <hi>future,</hi> and the <hi>paſt</hi> for the <hi>preſent,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This prophecy of our Lord, is very important and intereſting, and certainly holds forth great things, and to me appears ſufficient to eſtabliſh the doctrine of the Reſtoration. God's will is, that all men ſhall be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth. i Tim. ii. 4. This will of God our Saviour came to perform: and it ſhall finally be accompliſhed, however long it may be reſiſted, and apparently fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated. All things and conſequently all men, belong to Chriſt, being given to him by the Father; and all that the Father giveth to Chriſt ſhall come to him in ſuch a manner as in no wiſe to be caſt our, and ſhall therefore be ſaved by him.</p>
               <p>The next prophecy of our bleſſed Saviour that I ſhall conſider, is that which is written in St. John xii. 32. <q>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me;</q> our glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, that great Prophet, had often before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of his death, and of the manner and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thereof: He had foretold that he ſhould be betrayed into the hands of ſinful men, and that they ſhould mock, ſcourge, and crucify him; that he ſhould ſuffer a violent death, and the third day ſhould riſe again. Theſe things he had frequently mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But in this text he utters a grand prediction of what ſhould be the conſequence of his being thus lifted up, <hi>as Moſes lifted up the ſerpent in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs;</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:025049_0055_0FCDAFF64CB95AD0"/>
viz. that he ſhould certainly at laſt draw all men unto himſelf. This was a part of the joy that Was ſet before him, and for the ſake of which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame. He beheld in proſpect Satan's empire fallen and deſtroyed; and all brought back again to God, being drawn by him in due ſeaſon; for as he <q>gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time;</q> (1 Tim. ii. 6.) ſo he will draw all unto himſelf in the fulneſs of the ages: for <q>he ſhall ſee of the travail of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied:</q> He ſhall juſtify the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude whoſe iniquities he hath borne. Iſai. liii. 11.</p>
               <p>This is the reward which he was to have for all his pain and ſorrow. And who that loves Jeſus, would wiſh him to be deprived of that infinite and inconoeivable pleaſure which he muſt have in ſeeing all men come to him, and obtain eternal life, through his ſufferings and death?</p>
               <p>It was for this reaſon that he had power given him over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to all, without, exception, whom, the Father had given him; St. John xvii. 2. And if any thing can be proved from expreſs words of Scripture, it is plain that all things were given into his hands for that very purpoſe.</p>
               <p>There are two or three ways that thoſe who are averſe to the doctrine of the General Reſtoration en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to evade or deſtroy the force of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy which I am now upon; but the attempts are ſo weak they are hardly worth notice. One is this, that <hi>all</hi> doth not intend <hi>all without exception.</hi> But this is anſwered by St. Paul, Heb. ii. 8. <q>Thou haſt put all things in ſubjection under hit feet. For in that he put all in ſubjection under him, ME LEFT NOTHING THAT IS NOT PUT UNDER him.</q> So that having the judgment of ſuch a
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:025049_0056_0FCDAFF806A08880"/>
reaſoner as St. Paul on my ſide, I ſhall be very little concerned at this evaſion.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, that nothing more was intended by our Lord in this prediction, but that if he was lifted up on the croſs, a great multitude of people would be drawn together to behold him. This is a pretty conceit indeed! ſo ſuppoſe our Lord juſt having heard a voice from heaven, ſhould comfort himſelf with this conſolation tending ſo greatly to mitigate his ſufferings! What ſhould we think of our Lord if we could receive this as the meaning of the text? We ſhould always take care not to indulge low and unworthy, mean and little ideas of the words of Chriſt. Would you not think a man bereaved of his reaſon, or exceedingly hardened and trifling, who being doomed to ſuffer a cruel and very ſhameful as well as painful death, ſhould conſole himſelf with the thought, that a vaſt number of ſpectators ſhould be preſent to behold him ſuffer? The idea is too ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to dwell upon.</p>
               <p>There are others who ſay the meaning of the words muſt be that Chriſt will draw all men before his judgment ſeat. But why was this connected with his ſuffering death on the croſs? The words muſt intend a kind of drawing of all men that could not have taken place unleſs he had ſuffered that kind of death; and alſo ſuch an event as gave him the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt poſſible pleaſure, and encouraged him to bear his ſufferings for the ſake of ſeeing its accompliſhment. Now both theſe ideas meet, if Jeſus ſhall draw all men without exception to himſelf, to be ſaved, but not elſe.</p>
               <p>For it is through (or in conſequence of) his death upon the croſs that men ſhall be drawn to him to be ſaved; and this ſhall afford him the higheſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. In conſequence of his thus humbling himſelf, and becoming obedient unto death, even the death
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:025049_0057_0FCDAFFBE39E2618"/>
of the croſs, he hath the higheſt glory, honour, and power given to him as Mediator; and ſhall have the pleaſure of drawing all to himſelf, of ſaving all from their ſins. And in his name every knee ſhall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and every tongue ſhall confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the glory of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Phil. ii. 10, 11. And as <q>no man can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt.</q> 1 Cor. xii. 3. and as all ſhall truly confeſs him Lord, to the glory of God the Father, it follows that all ſhall ſo come to Chriſt as to be ſaved by him; which was the thing to be proved. Thus he that was lifted up on the croſs ſhall attract all men to himſelf, for the moſt glorious purpoſes; and ſhall reveal the glory of the Lord to them, "And all fleſh ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God." St. Luke, iii. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the ſin of the world!</q> St. John i. 29. <q>For God ſo loved, the world, that he gave his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life. For God ſent not his ſon into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be ſaved.</q> Chap. iii. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We know that this is indeed the Chriſt, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world</q> chap. iv. 42.</p>
               <p>This is a moſt glorious view of the ſufferings of Chriſt; and conſidered as neceſſary in order to draw all men to him to be ſaved, they are highly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</p>
               <p>There are many other ſayings among the words of Chriſt ſavourable to the doctrine of the univerſal reſtoration; but as the three prophecies I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready conſidered are very full and plain to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I ſhall leave them to your meditation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:025049_0058_0FCDAFFE14BAF220"/>
to mention a few of thoſe prophetical ſayings written by the Apoſtles upon this head.</p>
               <p>The only paſſage I ſhall notice in the book of Acts, is chap. iii. 20, 21. <q>And he ſhall ſend Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus who before was preached unto you; Whom the heavene muſt receive until the times of the reſtitution of all things, which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets ſince the world began.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The reſtitution of all things is a truth, or there could be no times and ſeaſons appointed for it. The reſtitution of all things includes the reſtoration of man. This is one of the great ſubjects of prophecy. God hath not only revealed it in general, but hath ſpoken of it by the mouth of all his holy prophets ſince the world began. Therefore it is revealed in the old teſtament as well as in the new. It was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the prophets, and confirmed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and is a ſubject of the greateſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of any in all prophecy, ſince God hath declared it from the beginning, and it hath been revealed to all his prophets. It is very clear that it doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer to any thing that hath already taken place, ſince our Lord and Saviour muſt come from heaven to perform the important work. Reſtitution of all things is bringing every thing back to as good a ſtate, at leaſt, as that wherein they were placed at firſt by God. It is moſt certainly a change for the better, and never for the worſe. This important work is not to be done inſtantaneouſly, but in times, ſeaſons, and ages, and every thing in its proper order.</p>
               <p>Theſe propoſitions appear to me naturally to riſe out of the text, and many diſcourſes might be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from them.</p>
               <p>Some have ſaid, that the Reſtitution of all things in this paſſage cannot mean what I have ſuppoſed it
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:025049_0059_0FCDB00059C90B30"/>
doth, and only refers to the diſpenſation of grace in the preſent time before the ſecond coming of Chriſt, becauſe he muſt be retained in the heavens until the times of Reſtitution of all things <hi>are paſt;</hi> (as they would explain the words:) But as no ſuch idea is proved from the text, the general teſtimony of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives me authority to ſay that Chriſt ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the heavens until the times, ages, or ſeaſons of Reſtitution <hi>arrive,</hi> or <hi>commence;</hi> but by no means till they end; as ſuch a propoſition would be entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the whole ſyſtem of prophecy</p>
               <p>The next prophecy in order upon this great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is Rom. v. 18, 19, 20, 21. But this I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready conſidered. Let none ſay that this is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy: for the expreſſions, <q>ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous;</q> are as true and poſitive a prophecy, as it is a melancholy fact, that <q>by one man's diſobedience many were made ſinners.</q> If one be a true hiſtory, the other is of conſequence a true prophecy. <q>Where ſin abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed grace did much more abound:</q> is a glorious prophecy that puts the paſt tenſe for the future, to ſhew the abſolute certainty of its fulfilment, as though it was already done. It muſt be confeſſed to be a prophecy, for there never yet was a time when grace abounded as much as ſin, far leſs <hi>much more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sin hath reigned unto death: this is certain; ſo ſhall grace reign through righteouſneſs; not only ſo far as to make eternal life poſſible to all, but certain for all, or elſe the reign of grace would not be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and powerful as that of ſin.</p>
               <p>I come next to that very grand and glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, Rom. viii. 21. <q>Becauſe the creature it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="unknown:025049_0060_0FCDB00225D43828"/>I ſhall take the liberty of reading the foregoing and following verſes and the brief remarks which I made upon them in my fermon, called, <hi>The Goſpel preached by the Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 19—23. <q>For the earneſt expectation of the creature, (<hi>or</hi> the creation) waiteth for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the ſons of God. For the creature (<hi>or</hi> the creation) was made ſubject to vanity; not willingly, but by reaſon of him who hath ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame in hope: becauſe the creature (<hi>or</hi> the creation) itſelf ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorius liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth, and travaileth in pain together until now: and not only they but ourſelves alſo, which have the firſt-fruits of the Spirit; even we ourſelves groan within ourſelves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</q>
               </p>
               <p>'I would obſerve, on this text:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>1. That it is evident, that the whole creation ſtands here diſtinguiſhed from the ſons or children of God, who are ſpoken of apart.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>2. That the creation is now ſubject unto vanity, miſery, pain, death, and deſtruction: that under this burden it groaneth and travaileth in pain to be delivered from the ſame.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>3. That the creation is only ſubjected to this ſtate of miſery for a time, and hath hopes of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; and, therefore, waiteth for the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſons of God, with earneſt expectation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>4. That a time <hi>ſhall</hi> certainly come, when the creature itſelf (<hi>or</hi> the whole creation) ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the bondage of corruption; from ſin, with all its concomitants and conſequences, into
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:025049_0061_0FCDB005F9E2F840"/>
the glorious liberty of the ſons of God; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imply leſs than a total and final deliverance from ſin, guilt, pain, ſorrow, miſery, deſtruction, and death of every kind; for all theſe the ſons of God are freed from.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>5. If the whole creation is thus delivered, the ſouls and bodies of all men (the children of God except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who are ſpoken of apart, and are the patterns and firſt-fruits) muſt be neceſſarily included; as alſo all intelligences. For who can rationally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the inferior parts of the creation ſhall be delivered, and the more noble and valuable parts be left under the power and bondage of ſin and corruption, while God exiſts?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>6. We evidently ſee, that the children of God, who have the firſt fruits of the Spirit, who now bitterly groan for deliverance from ſin and its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, for perfect and compleat redemption, both of ſoul and body, which none can attain till the morning of the reſurrection, ſhall be firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered; and be the patterns and firſt-fruits of that general deliverance and liberty, which ſhall be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally given to the whole creation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thus, if the whole creation ſhall at length be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God; we that have the firſt fruits of the Spirit, may draw conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from that ſource; For ſurely, if God deſigns to deliver the whole creation, much more will be deliver <hi>us,</hi> to whom he hath already given his Spirit: and we ſhall become a kind of firſt fruits of his creatures.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Laſtly, We may obſerve, that thoſe who have the firſt-fruits of the Spirit, wait for the adoption, to wit, the redemption, reſurrection, or change of this earthly body. As the Apoſtle ſays to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians;</q>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="63" facs="unknown:025049_0062_0FCDB0070601C7E0"/>For our converſation is in heaven, from whence we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to ſubdue all things unto himſelf;</q> Phil. iii. '20, 21.'</p>
               <p>Rom. xi. Is a wonderful chapter, and is full of grace and truth, and contains promiſes of great mercy and favour to the reprobate part of the nation of Iſrael, whom God hath ſhut up in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon them all; But as I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to diſcourſe particularly on that chapter, I ſhall paſs over it at preſent; only I recommend to you to read it attentively, and ſee if it does not appear evidently favourable to the general reſtoration: for if the Jews that were cut off, ſhall be grafted in again, and are concluded, (or ſhut up) in unbelief for purpoſes of mercy and grace, can we think that all other nations that die in unbelief muſt remain ſo to eternity? Will God make ſo great a difference between thoſe whole caſes are ſo nearly alike?</p>
               <p>The next great New Teſtament prophecy of the final ſubjection, and as I believe, reſtitution of all things, is in 1 Cor. xv. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>For as in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive. But every man in his own or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; Chriſt the firſt fruits; afterward they that are Chriſt's at his coming. Then the end, when he ſhall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he ſhall have put down all rule, and all authority, and power. For he muſt reign till he hath put all enemies under his ſeet. The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is death, (or, Death the laſt enemy ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.) For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he faith, all things are put under him,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:025049_0063_0FCD83F12D71CDE8"/>
it is manifeſt that he is excepted who did put all things under him. And when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him, then ſhall the Son alſo himſelf, be ſubject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This paſſage ſeems to contain in miniature the whole great and glorious plan from beginning to end. The loſs that we ſuſtained by our connection with the firſt Adam, ſhall at laſt be fully repaired by the ſecond Adam. Some reckon that loſs greater, and ſome loſs; but this prophecy applies unſelf to all according to their ideas: for whatever life we loſt in him, we ſhall regain in Chriſt. But this renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be carried on in the moſt beautiful order imaginable. At the coming of Chriſt all his ſaints ſhall be entirely renewed in body as well as ſpirit, and ſhall be totally delivered from all the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſin: and in due time the creature itſelf alſo, or the whole creation, ſhall in like manner be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the bondage of corruption, all moral and natural, evil, into the glorious liberty of the children of God, as you have heard; for Chriſt muſt reign until all ſhall ſubmit to him, and all that bears the name of death ſhall be deſtroyed. Then ſhall he deliver the kingdom to the Father, that God may be all in all. This great event is the cloſing ſcene, as far as divine Revelation carries us; and I deſign to cloſe this courſe of Lectures on the prophecies with a diſcourſe on this very ſublime ſubject, and ſhall therefore paſs it over for the preſent.</p>
               <p>Three paſſages in the epiſtles of St. Paul that have long appeared to me as grand predictions of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſubjection, reheading and reconciliation of all things, are Epheſians i. 10. Col. i. 20 and Phil. ii. 9, 10, 11. Perhaps there may be ſome who will not like to conſider them in the light of prophecies; but if declarations made by divine authority of great things not brought about at the time when they are
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:025049_0064_0FCDB00A05C251C8"/>
ſpoken of, are prophecies, then theſe are ſo to all intents; for the things therein declared have not yet been fulfilled; but that is no argument that they never ſhall be. I ſhall therefore conſider them as glorious prophecies, not yet accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>In the laſt of theſe paſſages, which I had occaſion to conſider in the former Lecture, the apoſtle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and enumerates all intelligences in the moſt particular manner—<hi>every knee, and every tongue, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth.</hi> If theſe do not comprehend all intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences in the univerſe, I do not know what expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions can be uſed to convey that idea. And their bowing in the name of Jeſus, and confeſſing him Lord, to the glory of God the Father, to me evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implies, or rather, plainly expreſſes their ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and willing obedience to him, and their adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him.</p>
               <p>And in the firſt of the before-mentioned paſſages, the apoſtle ſpeaks to the Epheſians, that God, that great and glorious Being, who worketh all things after, or according to the counſel of his own will, had made known to them the myſtery of his will, according to his good pleaſure which he hath purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in himſelf, <q>That in the diſpenſation of thé fulneſs of times, he might gather together in one, (or re-head) all things in Chriſt, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him.</q> This great event is ſpoken of as certainly determined by the divine will, and it was therefore revealed or made known, though the actual and full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it was future, yea, and at a great diſtance of time; even in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times. This cannot therefore refer to any thing that actually took place at the aſcenſion of Chriſt, (as ſome would have us believe) but to what ſhall be performed before he ſhall deliver up the kingdom to the Father. Every thing muſt be re-headed in Chriſt; his whole
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:025049_0065_0FCDB00BD2BB3E08"/>
army ſhall be brought back again from all their wanderings and rebellions, and ſhall willingly rally, and range themſelves under the ſtandard of their great leader and head. And as it is impoſſible for them ſo to do until their league with hell and death is broken, and they are delivered from the love and power of ſin, which can have no connexion with the holy Lord; therefore I conclude their final reſtoration from this text.</p>
               <p>The other paſſage, Col. i. 20. in its connexion appears to me as luch a ſtrong proof of a real uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal reconciliation taking place throughout the univerſe, between all creatures and their God, and alſo among themſelves, that I almoſt wonder how it ſhould ever be explained away, as meaning little or nothing. It is ſo extenſive that there can be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; and ſurely all things being reconciled to God, is inconſiſtent with any of them being miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all eternity!</p>
               <p>I ſhall preſent the text before you in its connexion, and ſome remarks which I made upon it in my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon before mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Apoſtle, in the firſt chapter, having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Jeſus Chriſt, and redemption through him; goes on to tell the church, who Jeſus was, what he had done, and would do, in theſe words;</q> 
                  <q>Who is the image of the inviſible God, the firſt-born of <hi>every creature.</hi> For by him were <hi>all things</hi> created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, viſible and inviſible; whether they be thrones, or dominions or principalities, or powers: <hi>all things</hi> were created by him, and for him. And he is before <hi>all things,</hi> and by him <hi>all things</hi> conſiſt. And he is the head of the body, the church; who is the beginning, the firſt-born from the dead: that in all things he might have the pre-eminence. for it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:025049_0066_0FCDB01296C51618"/>
fulneſs dwell: and having made peace through the blood of his croſs, by him to RECONCILE ALL THINGS UNTO HIMSELF; by him I ſay, whether they be <hi>things in earth,</hi> or <hi>things in heaven:</hi>
                  </q> Col. i. 15—20.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If the Apoſtle had known, that the intention of God, actually to reconcile all things to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, who had made peace through the blood of his croſs, would have been diſputed, he could hardly have expreſſed himſelf, in a manner more calculated to deſtroy the very foundation of the diſpute for ever. He informs us plainly, what he means by <hi>all things,</hi> viz. all the things or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that were created by Chriſt, whether in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or in earth; whether to us viſible or inviſible; whether thrones or dominions, or principalities, or power: all theſe being created <hi>by him,</hi> were alſo created <hi>for him,</hi> for his glory and pariſe; he was head over them all. Some of them fell; thereby the whole glorious chain and connexion was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: God's wrath was revealed agaiſt ſin, his juſt indignation burned as a fire. Fallen creatures hated God and goodneſs, as alſo all thoſe of their fellow creatures who were ſtill attached to their Creator: conſequently, a fierce war was waged, between the two armies that before were one. In order to lay the foundation of a firm and eternal peace, Chriſt came and ſuffered, and hath made peace by the blood of his croſs, and hath opened a way for actual reconciliation to take place. He is now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the great work of ſubduing his foes, which he will finally compleat, and thus reconcile all things again to God; both celeſtial, or thoſe that were created in heaven; and terreſtial, or thoſe that were created on earth: And as they ſhall all be reconciled to God, ſo alſo to each other; and thus all ſhall be reſtored to their original harmony, beauty, and perfection. Now, who does not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, that the final extent of this reconciliation muſt be as large as creation itſelf, ſince the Apoſtle
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:025049_0067_0FCDB01928042018"/>
evidently uſe the ſame form of expreſſion in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing the one as the other? And this idea is never contradicted. Now, by the ſome rule that you will ſay, that the <hi>all things</hi> that ſhall be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God by Chriſt, both in heaven and in earth, are only <hi>ſome things;</hi> one may tell you, that he only created <hi>ſome things,</hi> and have juſt the ſame reſon for his aſſertion. And beſides, <hi>What are</hi> thoſe things in heaven, that need reconciling to God—if they are not the very things that the the Lord Jeſus created in heaven, and who kept not that firſt eſtate? It is plain then, that St. Paul, without giving us the leaſt notice of any deſign that he had of varying the meaning of the expreſſion, <hi>all things;</hi> hath applied it both to the creation and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of intelligences, without the ſmalleſt apparent difference: And can any rational perſon ſuppoſe, that a man of his character as a writer, and divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſpired with the Holy Ghoſt, ſhould deal ſo unfairly in a matter of ſuch infinite importance, as to uſe an expreſſion in an unlimited ſenſe, four or five times, as though he would fix that idea in our minds; and then, in a moment without giving the ſmalleſt hint, ſhould make uſe of it in a very different and partial manner, and condemn all as heretics, that ſhould not underſtand that he did ſo: even though it was impoſſible for any one to perceive, either by the ſubject or manner of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that he uſed it in a different ſenſe, and that he would never condeſcend to explain it?—They that can think ſo, muſt; I cannot.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The declaration of St. Paul to Timothy, if it has not the form, has all the ſubſtance and eſſence of a prophecy. And it may be obſerved that the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles to Timothy abound with great and important prophecies. He foretels in his firſt epiſtle the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy of the church of Rome in the plaineſt manner; chap. iv. 1, 2, 3. And in the ſecond, he ſpeaks no le's plainly of the defection of the proteſtant churches,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:025049_0068_0FCDB01B4D547DA8"/>
and the ſtate of mankind in theſe latter days. chap. vi. 1—7. Theſe two important, though melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly prophecies were delivered with great ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and certainty, and have been remarkably fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and are fulfilling in theſe days. It is however matter of great conſolation to find that St. Paul's character as a prophet is hereby ſo firmly eſtabliſhed, that we may ſafely believe what he declares to us as the will of God, reſpecting the final ſalvation, or reſtoration of mankind.</p>
               <p>I cannot but conſider that grand paſſage in his firſt epiſtle, chap. ii. 1—8. taken altogether, as ſuch a foundation for the doctrine I am now upon, as never can be overthrown by all the art of man. Firſt, he exhorts us to make ſupplications, prayers, interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and giving of thanks for all men; for kings and for all that are in authority: &amp;c. for which he gives this reaſon <q>For this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour (or Reſtorer); who will have all men to be ſaved (or reſtored), and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</q> It is therefore good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour to pray for all men, becauſe he will have all men to be reſtored, and as a mean thereto he will have them to come to the knowledge of the trurh; and therefore there is the higheſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for us to pray for all men, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there could not be. Now ſince it is the will of God that all men ſhould be ſaved or reſtored, and come to the knowledge of the truth, and it is alſo plain, that he worketh all things after the counſel of his own will; and doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, What doeſt thou? and his counſel ſhall ſtand, and he will do all his pleaſure: (See Epheſ. i. 11. Dan. iv. 35. Iſai. xlvi. 10.) What can poſſibly prevent the ſalvation, or reſtoration of all men?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:025049_0069_0FCDB01CC77CDEC0"/>Some will not allow the words to be read, <hi>who will have all men to be ſaved,</hi> but that he <hi>willeth that all men ſhould be ſaved;</hi> and ſome would inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate as though God had two contrary wills, one being his revealed will, that all men ſhould be ſaved, and the other his ſecret and efficacious will, that many ſhould be finally loſt. While others ſay, that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the will and pleaſure of God, and what would be agreeable to him, that all men ſhould be ſaved, but that they being moral agents have power to fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the will of God, But though I freely grant, man is a moral agent, otherwiſe he could not be a ſubject of rewards and puniſhments; and I alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that his will may for a time ſuſpend the will of God reſpecting his ſalvation, yet it cannot finally fruſtrate it; for God's will muſt be done, And tho' man's being a moral agent, is the true reaſon why he is wrong at all, or continues ſo a moment, yet that can be no proof that he ſhall be able to all eternity to withſtand the will of God, and if that be done at laſt it is enough to ſave the credit of the prophecy. If a parent has a ſtubborn child, and he corrects him with a will to reclaim him, though he ſtands out for a long time, yet if he be brought at laſt to yield, the parents will, as to the deſign, ſhall be as truly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed as though the child had reſigned the firſt minute. Thus it is with reſpect to the will of God, he will never yield the point until his pleaſure ſhall be fully performed.</p>
               <p>After St. Paul has declared what the will of God is, reſpecting the final reſtoration of all men, he proceeds to ſet before us the foundation there is laid for its accompliſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>For there is one God, and one Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus; Who gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in due time,</q> (or, a teſtimony for its proper ſeaſon)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:025049_0070_0FCDB01EA1D777A8"/>Many arguments might be drawn from theſe words in favour of the univerſal reſtoration; as from the conſideration of there being a God of infinite wiſdom, power, and goodneſs, the Father and Creator of all, whoſe determinate will and counſel it is that all men ſhould be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth. And the more effectually to perform this will, he hath ordained as a Mediator, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, the Anointed Saviour, who being a partaker of both natures, is well qualified to perform the great work: and who for that purpoſe gave himſelf a ranſom for all: and although this hath been long hidden from men, yet it is a teſtimony for its proper time and ſeaſon, and ſhall be made known and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come efficacious to all.</p>
               <p>Then the Apoſtle goes on to tell Timothy, that he was appointed an Apoſtle to the Gentiles, and a preacher of this doctrine, and that in faith and verity, and that he teſtified the truth in Chriſt, and did not lie nor deceive. And then to cloſe the whole, and to connect our practical duty with the belief of this great truth, he adds, <q>I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As much as though he ſhould ſay,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Since it is the will of God that all men ſhould be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, and that Chriſt Jeſus is the great Mediator appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring about this purpoſe of God, and he hath already given himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time; and I am appointed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim this good news; ſince theſe things are ſo, it is my deſire and wiſh, that men would pray every where for the accompliſhment of theſe divine pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, lifting up holy hands without wrath, and without doubting.</q> And as it is impoſſible to pray for the ſalvation or reſtoration of all men without
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:025049_0071_0FCDB023ED8117F8"/>
doubting, unleſs we believe that all ſhall be reſtored, and as St. Paul has commanded us to pray for it without doubting, it is evident that we ought to believe it firmly; and as we ought not to believe any thing unleſs it be true, it ſeems infallibly to follow, that all men without exception ſhall be reſtored, and ſhall come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
               <p>In this ſame epiſtle, chap. iv. 9, 10, 11. the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle writes thus, <q>This is a faithful ſaving, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all acceptation. For therefore we both la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and ſuffer reproach, becauſe we truſt in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe that believe. Theſe things command and teach.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This paſſage confirms the idea that we drew from the other, viz. that God will have all men to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth, He is the great reſtorer of all men, eſpecially of thoſe who now believe in him. But if he is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour or Reſtorer of believers only, why is it ſaid, <hi>eſpecially of thoſe that believe?</hi> Theſe ſtand diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from <hi>all men,</hi> of whom he is the Saviour or Reſtorer. Theſe things the Apoſtle preached, and exhorted Timothy to command and teach them. This fully anſwers thoſe who wiſh to have them kept ſecret. But is it not ſtrange that thoſe who believe God to be the Saviour or Reſtorer of all men, and truſt in him as ſuch, ſhould ſuffer reproach for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Yet thus it was in the days of St. Paul, and ſo it is now. Yet it ſtill remains a <hi>faithful ſaying,</hi> and it is <hi>worthy of all acceptation:</hi> and equally concerns all, as all are intereſted therein.</p>
               <p>In the epiſtle to the Hebrews, there is a paſſage which muſt be conſidered as a prophecy not yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled; for the Apoſtle aſſures us that we do not yet ſee it, and therefore as it muſt be ſeen, it remains to be accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="unknown:025049_0072_0FCDB025A8A9F150"/>Heb. ii. 8. <q>Thou haſt put all things in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection under his ſeet. For in that he put all is ſubjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we ſee not yet all things put under him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This text is another ſpecimen of the manner of the ſacred writers in ſpeaking of things that are to come as though they were already accompliſhed, to ſhew their certainty: But leſt any perſon ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the event actually done, and that nothing more was deſigned to take place than what has already been, he ſays, <q>But now we ſee not yet all things put under him.</q> All things muſt yield to him, without exception; for <hi>all</hi> includes the whole, and nothing ſhall be leſt. This reaſoning of the apoſtle reſpecting the word <hi>all,</hi> is a key to all thoſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant places of Scripture, where the ſame word is uſed, where the redemption of mankind is treated of, or any doctrine of importance; for unleſs the word <hi>all</hi> was uſed in its proper natural ſenſe in all ſuch paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, we ſhould be frequently led thereby into error and uncertainty, and into great miſtakes. The uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſubjection here ſpoken of, is ſomething that hath not yet taken place, and is conſiſtent with hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, ſince all things are to be thus brought into ſubjection: But all things cannot be miſerable, though all may be happy; and ſince all alike are to be put in ſubjection, the text evidently implies uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal happineſs. And to open a way for this, Jeſus Chriſt, by the grace of God, taſted death for all. And as all are purchaſed by his blood, ſo he hath power over all, to give eternal life to all whom the Father hath given to him; who are all, without any exception.</p>
               <p>And the apoſtle ſays in this ſame epiſtle, chap. x. 12, 13. <q>But this man after he had offered one ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſins, for ever ſat down at the right
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:025049_0073_0FCDB02684B3A4D0"/>
hand of God: From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footſtool.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The glorious Saviour who hath died for all, will finally ſubdue all; and his greateſt enemies ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him, and humble themſelves before his feet. He will abaſe the proud, and bring every knee to bow to him, and every tongue to ſwear; and then he will reſign the kingdom to the Father, that God may be all in all.</p>
               <p>I muſt now draw towards a cloſe, and paſſing over the ſhort epiſtles of St. James, Peter, John, and Jude, as I did moſt of the minor prophets in the Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, I ſhall come down to the book of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of St. John. And having already diſcourſed largely upon the new heaven, new earth, and New Jeruſalem, and the gracious deſigns of God in the new creation, &amp;c. I ſhall have the leſs to remark upon the contents of that ſacred book, and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral paſſages therein which are in favour of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reſtoration.</p>
               <p>It is worthy of notice, that our Saviour Jeſus is frequently ſtiled in this book <hi>The Alpha and Omega; the beginning and the end; the firſt and the laſt.</hi> Chap. i. 8.17. xxi. 6, xxii. 13. Theſe words appear to me to intimate, that as he was with the Father before the world began, or before the beginning of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and conſequently before ſin, miſery, pain, and death exiſted; ſo he ſhall remain when they have no more being. They ſhall all be deſtroyed by his power; he ſhall outlive all enmity, and ſhall conquer all his foes: Death the laſt enemy ſhall be deſtroyed; and if the very laſt of all be deſtroyed, there can be none left in exiſtence. <q>And there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain: for the former things are paſſed away.</q> chap. xxi. 4. If we may venture to believe theſe words generally and literally to be
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:025049_0074_0FCDB0280CF21258"/>
a ture prophecy, the controverſy is ſettled at once; for if neither any thing bearing the name of <hi>death,</hi> neither <hi>ſorrow, nor crying, nor pain</hi> ſhall be found in being, then moſt certainly none of God's creatures can be miſerable to all eternity.</p>
               <p>The diſtinction which is made in this book be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the elect or ſealed ones, and the great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude whom no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues, who yet were ſaved though they ſtood in a different order, gave me a moſt wonderful turn of mind, when I firſt obſerved and ſeriouſly conſidered it. I ſaw that the <hi>many</hi> ſhould be finally ſaved, though only the <hi>few</hi> in the firſt degree. I beheld theſe as two diſtinct bodies; their number, ſituation, and ſongs were clearly different; one was a ſmall certain number, the other an innumerable multitude; the one ſtood with the Lamb on Mount Sion, the other before the throne; one ſung a new ſong that no man could learn but the hundred forty and four thouſand, who were redeemed from the earth, and from among men, ſaying, <q>Thou art worthy; for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us unto God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And haſt made us unto our God, kings and prieſts; and we ſhall reign on the earth:</q> And the other, <q>Salvation to our God, who ſitteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the throne, and unto the Lamb.</q> See chap. xiv. 1—5. chap. vii. chap. v. 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>Time will not permit me now to enter minutely into the conſideration of theſe and ſeveral other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in this book: but there is one text that muſt not be paſſed over without ſome remarks, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a moſt glorious viſion of a ſcene charming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond deſcription, which St. John heard and ſaw, and which ſhall finally be realized:—</p>
               <p>Chap. v. 13. <q>And every creature who is in
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:025049_0075_0FCDB02D1E903800"/>
heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and ſuch as are in the ſea, and all that are in them, heard I ſaying, Bleſſing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words are ſo plain and full, that very little need be ſaid upon them. It is obvious that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are as univerſal as poſſible; <hi>every creature in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, and ſuch as are in the ſea, and all that are in them,</hi> muſt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all intelligent beings throughout the univerſe; and their unſeigned and joyful aſcription of <hi>Bleſſing, and honour, and glory, and power to him that ſitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever,</hi> not only ſhews them to be willing ſubjects of God and the Lamb, but that they ſhall at that time be compleatly happy under his government, and ſhall praiſe him with thankful hearts and chearful voices. <q>Every thing that hath breath ſhall praiſe the Lord. Hallelujah.</q> This is ſo inconſiſtent with endleſs miſery, that it is impoſſible they ſhould ever ſtand together: for either every thing that hath breath ſhall never praiſe JEHOVAH, or an end muſt be put to ſin and miſery.</p>
               <p>But as nothing can be plainer than that all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures without exception ſhall praiſe God, and aſcribe to him the glory due to his name; therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with the higheſt degree of moral certainty that ſin, ſorrow, miſery, pain, and all kinds of death muſt have an end, and all rational intelligences be reclaimed, and reſtored to the favour and enjoyment of God; and ſhall praiſe him through all ages, in the nobleſt ſtrains of gratitude and love.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this Lecture with the words of the pious and ingenious Mr. Brooke, in his elegant and entertaining work, called THE FOOL or QUA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LITY.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:025049_0076_0FCDB0305626A398"/>
                  <q>And thus, on the grand and final conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when every will ſhall be ſubdued to THE WILL OF GOOD TO ALL, our JESUS will take in hand the reſigned chordage of our hearts; he will tune them as ſo many inſtruments, to the ſong of his own ſentiments, and will touch them with the finger of his own divine feelings. Then ſhall the wiſdom, the might, and the goodneſs of our God, become the wiſdom, might, and goodneſs of all his intelligent creatures; the happineſs of each ſhall mlutiply and overflow, in the wiſhes and participation of the happineſs of all; the univerſe ſhall begin to ſound with the ſong of congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and all voices ſhall break forth in an eternal hallelujah of praiſe, tranſcending praiſe, and glory, tranſcending glory, to God and the Lamb! There ſhall be no lapſe thenceforward, no falling away for ever; but God in his Chriſt, and Chriſt in his redeemed, ſhall be a will and a wiſdom, and an action and a mightineſs, and a goodneſs and a graciouſneſs, and a glory riſing on glory, and a bleſſing riſing on bleſſedneſs, through an ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to a never ending ETERNITY.</q>
