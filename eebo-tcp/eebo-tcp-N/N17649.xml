            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IF theſe pious MEDITATIONS, of ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime a genius, ſhould be inſcribed to any name, there is none but your's muſt have ſtood in the front of them.

determine where this reſpect ſhould be paid.</p>
            <p>Beſides, Madam, you well know that ſome copies out of theſe papers have been your own ſeveral years by the gift of the deceaſed; and the favour you have done me lately by your permiſſion to peruſe them, has aſſiſted the correction of theſe Manuſcripts, and would add another reaſon to ſupport this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of them, if your fear of aſſuming too much honour could but have admitted this piece of juſtice.</p>
            <p>I know, Madam, your tenderneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to every thing Mrs. ROWE has written, cannot with-hold your judgment from ſuſpecting ſome of her expreſſions to be a little too rapturous, and too near a-kin to the language of the myſtical writers; yet your piety and candour will take no ſuch

offence as to prevent your beſt improvement by them in all that is divine and holy; and may your retired hours find ſuch happy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances and elevations hereby, that you may commence the joys of angels and of bleſſed ſpirits before-hand.</p>
            <p>And when your valuable life has been long extended amidſt all the temporal bleſſings you enjoy, and the chriſtian virtues you prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, may you at the call of God find a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſmiſſion from mortality, and aſcend on high to meet your deceaſed friend in paradiſe. Nor can I ſuppoſe that any of the inhabitants of that bliſsful region will ſooner recognize your glorified ſpirit, or will ſalute your firſt appearance there with a more tender ſenſe of mutual ſatisfaction. There may you join with your beloved <hi>Philomela,</hi> in paying celeſtial worſhip, in exalted and unknown forms, to her God, and your God; and may

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE admirable author of theſe devotional pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers has been in high eſteem among the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and the polite, ſince ſo many excellent fruits of her pen, both in verſe and proſe, have appeared in public. She was early honoured, under the feigned name of <hi>Philomela,</hi> before the world was allowed to know Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Singer</hi> by the name drawn from her family, or that of Mrs. <hi>Rowe,</hi> which ſhe acquired by marriage.</p>
            <p>Though many of her writings that were publiſhed in her life-time diſcover a pious and heavenly temper, and a warm zeal for religion and virtue; yet ſhe choſe to conceal the <hi>Devotions of her heart</hi> till ſhe was got beyond the cenſure and the applauſe of mortals. It was enough that God, whom ſhe loved with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ſupreme affection, was witneſs to all her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and intenſe breathings after him.</p>
            <p>In <hi>February</hi> laſt he was pleaſed to call her out of our world, and take her to himſelf. Some time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her deceaſe, theſe manuſcripts were tranſmitted to me, all incloſed in one ſheet of paper, and directed to me at <hi>Newington,</hi> by her own hand: In the midſt of them I found her letter, which intreated me to review them and commit them to the preſs. This letter I have thought neceſſary to ſhew the world, not ſo much to diſcover my right to publiſh theſe papers, as
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:022860_0007_0FBA9EC3BB4D0F90"/>
to let the reader ſee ſomething more of that holy and heavenly character which ſhe maintained in an uniform manner both in life and death.</p>
            <p>It is now almoſt thirty years ago ſince I was hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured with her acquaintance, nor could her great modeſty conceal all her ſhining graces and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments; but it is not my province to give a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account of this excellent woman, who has bleſſed and adorned our nation and our age. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect her temper, her conduct, and her virtues will be ſet in a juſt and pleaſing light among the memoirs of her life, by ſome near relations, to whom the care of her poetical pieces and her familiar letters is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Devout Exerciſes</hi> are animated with ſuch fire as ſeems to ſpeak the language of holy paſſion, and diſcovers them to be the dictates of her heart; and thoſe who were favoured with her chief intimacy will moſt readily believe it. The ſtyle, I confeſs, is raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above that of common meditation or ſoliloquy; but let it be remembered ſhe was no common Chriſtian. As her virtues were ſublime, ſo her genius was bright and ſparkling, and the vivacity of her imagination had a tincture of the muſe almoſt from her childhood. This made it natural to her to expreſs the inward ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of her ſoul in more exalted language, and to paint her own ideas in metaphor and rapture near a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin to the diction of poeſy.</p>
            <p>The reader will here find a ſpirit dwelling in fleſh elevated into divine tranſports congenial to thoſe of angels and unbodied minds. Her intenſe love to her
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:022860_0008_0FBA9EC804EDDB28"/>
God kindles at every hint, and tranſcends the limits of mortality. I ſcarce ever met with any devotional writings which gave us an example of a ſoul, at ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſeaſons, ſo far raiſed above every thing that is not immortal and divine.</p>
            <p>Yet ſhe is conſcious of her frailties too: She ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times confeſſes her ſolly and her guilt in the ſight of God in the moſt affecting language of a deep humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. It is with a pathetic ſensibility of her weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in the ſtrongeſt language of ſelf-diſplicien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſhe bewails her offences againſt her Creator and Redeemer; and in her intervals of darkneſs, ſhe vents her painful complaints and mournings for the abſence of her higheſt and beſt beloved.</p>
            <p>Let it be obſerved, that it was much the faſhion, even among ſome divines of eminence, in former years, to expreſs the fervours of devout love to our Saviour in the ſtyle of the <hi>Song of Solomon:</hi> and I muſt confeſs that ſeveral of my compoſures in verſe, written in younger life, were led by thoſe examples unwarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this track. But if I may be permitted to ſpeak the ſenſe of maturer age, I can hardly think this the happieſt language in which Chriſtians ſhould <hi>generally</hi> diſcover their warm ſentiments of religion, ſince the clearer and more ſpiritual revelations of the New-Teſtament. Yet ſtill it muſt be owned, there are ſome ſouls favoured with ſuch beatifying viſits from heaven, and raptured with ſuch a flame of divine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as more powerfully engages all animal nature in their devotions, and conſtrains them to ſpeak their pureſt and moſt ſpiritual exerciſes in ſuch pathetic
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:022860_0009_0FBA9EC8DAAAF720"/>
and tender expreſſions as may be perverſely profaned by an unholy conſtruction. And the bias and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity toward this ſtyle is yet ſtronger, where early impreſſions of piety have been made on the heart by devout writings of this kind.</p>
            <p>It ſhould be remembered alſo, there is nothing to be found here which riſes above our ideas; here are none of thoſe abſurd and incomprehenſible phraſes which amuſe the ear with ſounding vanity, and hold reaſon in ſovereign contempt: Here are no viſionary ſcenes of wild extravagance, no affectations of he tumid and unmeaning ſtyle, which ſpreads a glaring confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion over the underſtanding; nothing that leads the reader into the region of thoſe myſtical ſhadows and darkneſs which abound in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> writers, under the pretence of refined light and ſublime ecſtacy. Nor is the character of this ingenious author to be blemiſhed with any other reproaches which have been ſometimes caſt on ſuch ſort of meditations.</p>
            <p>I know it hath been ſaid, that this language of rapture addreſſed to the Deity, is but a new track given to the flow of the ſofter powers, after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment of ſome meaner love; or at leaſt, it is owing to the want of a proper object and opportunity to fix thoſe tender paſſions: But this cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be the caſe here; for as Mrs. <hi>Rowe</hi> had been ſought early be ſeveral lovers, ſo ſhe ſpent ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years of younger life in the connubial ſtate with a gentleman of ſuch accompliſhments and ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that he was well fitted to be a partner of her joys and cares.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xi" facs="unknown:022860_0010_0FBA9ECA59E3DA78"/>I know alſo that this ſoft and paſſionate turn of religious meditation has ſometimes been imputed to injuries and ill-treatment in the marriage ſtate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſame affections are weaned from an undeſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing object, and poured out in amorous language upon an object ſupremely worthy and divine. But neither has this reproach any pretence in the preſent caſe: That happy pair had ſouls ſo near a-kin to each other, that they preſerved an uncommon amity, and mutual ſatisfaction, ſo long as providence favoured him with life. It is ſufficiently evident, then, that in theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations there is no ſecret panting after a mortal love in the language of devotion and piety.</p>
            <p>Nor yet can it be objected, that it was any diſplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and peeviſhneſs toward other things round about her, that taught her to expreſs herſelf with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the things of mortality, and all the gay and tempting ſcenes of the preſent ſtate: She was by no means ſour and moroſe, and out of humour with the world, nor with her acquaintance that dwelt in it: She often converſed freely with the gay and the great, and was in high eſteem among perſons of rank and honour. But honour and rank among mortals, with all the ſcenes of gaiety and greatneſs, were little, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable and forgotten things, while in her devout moments her eye and her heart were fixed on God, the ſupreme original of all excellence and all honour.</p>
            <p>In common life ſhe was affable and friendly with perſons of every rank and degree; and in her latter years, as ſhe drew nearer to hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>n, if ſhe avoided any thing, it was grandeur and public appearances on
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:022860_0011_0FBA9ECBCDB6E128"/>
earth. But ſhe never ſo concealed and abſtracted herſelf from the ſociety of any of her fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as to deſpiſe the meaneſt of her ſpecies. She was ever kind and compaſſionate to the diſtreſſed, and largely liberal to the indigent. Nor did ſhe neglect the daily duties of human life under a vain imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſhe moved in a higher ſphere, and was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphically exalted above them.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, there is nothing in theſe papers that can juſtly ſupport any ſuch ſort of cenſures, though men of corrupt minds may cover the bible itſelf with ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ridicule. Let all ſuch readers ſtand aloof, nor touch theſe ſacred leaves, leſt they pollute them.</p>
            <p>Though there is not one complete copy of verſes amongſt all theſe tranſports of her ſoul, yet ſhe ever carried with her a reliſh of poeſy even into her ſacred retirements. Sometimes ſhe ſprings her flight from a line or two of verſe, which her memory had impreſſed upon her heart: Sometimes from the midſt of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious elevations ſhe lights down upon a few lines of ſome modern poet, even <hi>Herbert</hi> as well as <hi>Milton,</hi> &amp;c. though it is but ſeldom ſhe cites their names. At other times the verſes ſeem to be the effuſion of her own rapturous thoughts in ſudden melody and metre; or at leaſt I know not whence the lines are copied: But ſhe moſt frequently does me the honour to make uſe of ſome of my writings in verſe in theſe holy medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her heart. Bleſſed be that God, who has ſo far favoured any thing my pen could produce, as to aſſiſt ſo ſublime a devotion.</p>

in ſome of theſe pieces, as well as from the early tranſcripts of ſeveral among her friends, it is evident they were written in her younger days; others are of a much later original, though there is but one that bears a date, and that is <hi>April</hi> 30, 1735. They ſeem to have been penned at ſpecial ſeaſons and occaſions throughout the courſe of her life. A few of them bear the corrections or additions of her own pen, which diſcovers itſelf by a little difference of the hand-writing.</p>
            <p>Though ſhe was never tempted away from our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chriſtianity into the faſhionable apoſtacies of the age, yet I am well informed from many hands, that in her latter years ſhe entered with more zeal and affection into ſome of the peculiar doctrines of the goſpel: And it is evident that ſome of theſe devotional pieces have a more evangelick turn than others, and probably moſt of thoſe were compoſed or corrected in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of life. The oppoſition which has of late been made to ſome of theſe truths, gave occaſion to her further ſearch into them, and her zeal for them. However, I have placed theſe papers all as I found them pinned up in a wrapping-paper, though it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, from plain circumſtances, this is not the order in which they were written, nor is that of any great importance.</p>
            <p>Though theſe writings give us the aſpirations of a devout ſoul in her holy retirements, when ſhe had no deſign to preſent the public with them; yet they did not want a great deal of adjuſtment or correction in order to ſee the light. The numbers and the titles
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:022860_0013_0FBA9ED1F75E0E98"/>
are added by the publiſher, as well as the breaks and pauſes, which give a ſort of reſt to the reader's mind, and make the review more eaſy. Here and there a too venturous flight is a little moderated; sometimes a meditation or a ſentence is completed, which ſeemed very imperfect, or a ſhort line or two inſerted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the ſenſe where the language ſeemed too ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt or the meaning too obſcure. Her ſoul had a large ſet of ideas in preſent view, which made every expreſſion ſhe uſed eaſy and perſpicuous to herſelf, when ſhe wrote only for her own uſe; though ſometimes her entire ſenſe might not be quite ſo obvious to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reader without a little introduction into her track of ſentiments: Upon the whole, I muſt acknowledge I was very unwilling that this excellent work ſhould loſe any degrees of elegance or brightneſs by paſſing through my hands.</p>
            <p>When the manuſcript came firſt under my reviſal, I read it over with the eye of a critick and a friend, that I might publiſh it with honour to the hand that wrote it, and with religious entertainment and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the world: Nor was this employment deſtitute of its proper ſatisfaction. But never did I feel the true pleaſure of theſe meditations, till I had finiſhed this labour of the <hi>head,</hi> and began to read them over again as <hi>devout exerciſes of the heart:</hi> Then I endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured to enter more entirely into the ſpirit of the pious author, and attempted to aſſume her language as my own. But how much ſuperior was the ſatisfaction which I received from this review, eſpecially where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I had reaſon to hope I could pronounce her
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:022860_0014_0FBA9ED360FA6DB8"/>
words with ſincerity of ſoul. How happily did this raiſe and entertain all my pleaſing paſſions, and gave me another ſort of delight than the dry, critical peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of them, in order to judge concerning their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety? But I confeſs alſo, it was an abaſing and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying thought when I found how often I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to drop the ſublime expreſſion from my lips, or forbid my tongue to uſe it, becauſe my own attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſunk ſo far beneath thoſe ſacred elevations of ſpirit, and fell ſo far ſhort of thoſe tranſcendent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of divine affection and zeal.</p>
            <p>Let me perſuade all that peruſe this book, to make the ſame experiment that I have done; and when they have ſhut out the world, and are reading in their retirements, let them try how far they can ſpeak this language, and aſſume theſe ſentiments as their own: And by aſpiring to follow them, may they find the ſame ſatisfaction and delight, or at leaſt learn the profitable leſſons of ſelf abaſement and holy ſhame: And may a noble and glorious ambition excite in their breaſts a ſacred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>That the publication of this little book may be favoured with the divine bleſſing for this happy end, is the ſincere deſire and requeſt of the publiſher, as it was the real motive of the ingenious and pious writer, to commit them by my hand to the public view.

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE opinion I have of your piety and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the reaſon of my giving you the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of looking over theſe papers, in order to publiſh them; which I deſire you to do as ſoon as you can conveniently; only you have full liberty to ſuppreſs what you think proper.</p>
            <p>I think there can be no vanity in this deſign, for I am ſenſible ſuch thoughts as theſe will not be for the taſte of the modiſh part of the world; and before they appear, I ſhall be entirely diſintereſted in the cenſure or applauſe of mortals.</p>
            <p>The reflections were occaſionally written, and only for my own improvement; but I am not without hopes that they may have the ſame effect on ſome pious minds, as the reading the experiences of others have had on my own ſoul. The experimental part of religion has generally a greater influence than its theory; and if, when I am ſleeping in the duſt, theſe ſoliloquies ſhould kindle a flame of divine love in the heart of the loweſt and moſt deſpiſed Chriſtian, be the glory given to the great ſpring of all grace and benignity.</p>
            <p>I have now done with mortal things, and all to
<pb facs="unknown:022860_0017_0FBA9ED7DB783618"/>
come is vaſt eternity—eternity—How tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting is the ſound! as long as God exiſts, my being and happineſs is ſecure. Theſe unbounded deſires, which the wide creation cannot limit, ſhall be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for ever. I ſhall drink at the fountain head of pleaſure, and be refreſhed with the emanations of original life and joy. I ſhall hear the voice of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created harmony ſpeaking peace and ineffable conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to my ſoul.</p>
            <p>I expect eternal life, not as a reward <hi>(of merit)</hi> but a pure act of bounty. Deteſting myſelf in every view I can take, I fly to the righteouſneſs and atonement of my great Redeemer, for pardon and ſalvation; this is my only conſolation and hope. <hi>Enter not into judgment, O Lord, with thy ſervant; for in thy ſight ſhall no fleſh be juſtified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Through the blood of the Lamb I hope for an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire victory over the laſt enemy; and that before this comes to you, I ſhall have reached the celeſtial heights; and while you are reading theſe lines, I ſhall be ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the throne of God, where faith ſhall be turned into viſion, and theſe languiſhing deſires ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the full fruition of immortal love.

               <p>WHY, O my God, muſt this mortal ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture put ſo great a ſeparation between my ſoul and thee? I am ſurrounded with thy eſſence, yet I cannot perceive thee?

               <p>O thou, whom unſeen, I love, by what powerful influence doſt thou attract my ſoul? the eye has not ſeen, nor the ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man to conceive, what thou art; and yet I love thee beyond all that mine eye hath ſeen, or my ear heard, beyond all that my heart can comprehend. Thou dwelleſt in heights of glory, to which no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thought can ſoar, and yet thou art more near

and intimate to my ſoul than any of the objects of ſenſe. Theſe ears have never heard thy voice, and yet I am better acquainted with thee, and can rely on thee with more confidence, than on the deareſt friend I have on earth.</p>
               <p>My heart cleaves to thee, O Lord, as its only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and finds in thee a ſecret and conſtant ſpring of conſolation. I ſpeak to thee with the utmoſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and think thy being my greateſt happineſs. The reflection on thy exiſtence and greatneſs recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates my ſpirits, and fills my heart with alacrity; my ſoul overflows with pleaſure, I rejoice, I triumph in thy independent bleſſedneſs, and abſolute dominion.

               <p>I, a worm of the earth, would join my aſſent with the infinite orders above, with all thy flaming miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters who rejoice in thy kingdom and glory.</p>
               <l>Tho' not with them, thy happier race allow'd</l>

               <l>But yet I feel the ſame immortal flame,</l>

               <p>I love thee—Thus far I can ſpeak, but all the reſt is unutterable; and I muſt leave the pleaſing tale untold till I can talk in the language of immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and then I'll begin the tranſporting ſtory, which ſhall never come to an end, but be ſtill and ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: for thy beauties, O thou faireſt of ten

thouſand, will ſtill be new, and ſhall kindle freſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour in my ſoul to all eternity. The ſacred flame ſhall riſe, nor find any limits till thy perfections find a period.</p>
               <p>I love thee, and O thou that knoweſt all things, read the characters that love has drawn on my heart: what excellence but thine in heaven and earth could raiſe ſuch aſpirations of ſoul, ſuch ſublime and fervent affections as thoſe I feel? what could fix my ſpirit but boundleſs perfection? what is there elſe for whoſe ſake I could deſpiſe all created glory? why am I not at reſt here among ſenſible enjoyments? whence ariſe theſe importunate longings, theſe infinite deſires? why does not the complete creation ſatisfy, or at leaſt delude me with a dream of happineſs? why do not the objects of ſenſe awake a more ardent ſentiment than things diſtant and inviſible? why ſhould I, who <hi>ſay to corruption, thou art my father,</hi> aſpire after a union with the immenſe divinity?</p>
               <p>You angels of God that behold his face, explain to me the ſacred myſtery; tell me how this heavenly flame began, unriddle its wondrous generation: who hath animated this mortal flame with celeſtial fire, and given a clod of earth this divine ambition? what could kindle it but the breath of God, which kindled up my ſoul? and to thee, its amiable original, it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends; it breaks through all created perfection, and keeps on its reſtleſs courſe to the firſt pattern of beauty.</p>
               <p>Ye flowery varieties of the earth, and you ſparkling glories of the ſkies, your blandiſhments are vain,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:022860_0021_0FBA9EE0E2680778"/>
while I purſue an excellence that caſts a reproach on all your glory. I would fain cloſe my eyes on all the various and lovely appearances you preſent, and would open them on a brighter ſcene. I have deſires which nothing viſible can gratify; to which no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial things are ſuitable. O when ſhall I find objects more entirely agreeable to my intellectual faculties? my ſoul ſprings forward in purſuit of a diſtant good, whom I follow by ſome faint ray of light, which only glimmers by ſhort intervals before me. Oh! when will it diſperſe the clouds, and break out in full ſplendor on my ſoul?</p>
               <p>But what will the open viſion of thy beauties ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, if, while thou art but faintly imagined, I love thee with ſuch a ſacred fervour. To what bleſſed heights ſhall my admiration riſe, when I ſhall behold thee in full perfection; when I ſhall ſee thee as thou art, exalted in majeſty, and complete in beauty? how ſhall I triumph then in thy glory, and in the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of my own being? what ineffable thoughts will riſe to find myſelf united to the all-ſufficient divinity, by ties which the ſons of men have no names to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, by an engagement that the revolution of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal years ſhall not diſſolve? the league of nature ſhall be broken, and the laws of the mingled elements be cancelled; but my relation to the almighty God ſhall ſtand fixed and unchangeable as his own exiſtence? <hi>Nor life, nor death, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, ſhall ever ſeparate me from his love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Triumph, O my ſoul, and rejoice; look forward
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:022860_0022_0FBA9EE2D840E878"/>
beyond the period of all terreſtrial things: look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ten thouſand ages of celeſtial bleſſedneſs, look forward ſtill, and take an immeaſurable proſpect; preſs on and leave unnumbered ages behind, ages of ineffable peace and pleaſure; plunge at once into the ocean of bliſs, and call eternity itſelf thy own.</p>
               <p>There are no limits to the proſpect of my joy; it runs parallel with the duration of the infinite divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; my bliſs is without bounds; O when ſhall the full poſſeſſion of it commence.</p>

               <p>Yet ſtill there are higher aggravations of my iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and what gives me the utmoſt confuſion is, that I have ſinned againſt unbounded love and goodneſs: horrid ingratitude! here lies the emphaſis of my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and miſery: the ſenſe of this torments me, can I not ſay, as much as the dread of hell, or the fears of

loſing heaven? Thy love and tender compaſſion, the late pleaſing ſubjects of my thoughts, are on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count become my terror. The titles of an enemy and a judge ſcarce found more painful to my ears, than thoſe of a friend and a benefactor, which ſo ſhamefully enhance my guilt: thoſe ſacred names confound and terrify my ſoul, becauſe they furniſh my conſcience with the moſt exquiſite reproaches: The thoughts of ſuch goodneſs abuſed, and ſuch clemency affronted, ſeem to me almoſt as inſupportable as thoſe of thy wrath and ſeverity.</p>
               <p>O whither ſhall I turn! I dare not look upward; the ſun and ſtars upbraid me there: If I look down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the fields and fountains take their Creator's part, and heaven and earth conſpire to aggravate my ſins; thoſe common bleſſings tell me how much I am indebted to thy bounty; but, Lord, when I recall thy particular favours, I am utterly confounded; what numerous inſtances could I recount? Nor has my rebellion yet ſhut up the fountain of thy grace; for yet I breathe, and yet I live, and live to implore a pardon: Heaven is ſtill open, and the throne of God acceſſible. But oh! with what confidence can I approach it? What motives can I urge, but ſuch as carry my own condemnation in them.</p>
               <p>Shall I urge thy former pity and indulgence? This were to plead againſt myſelf; and yet thy clemency, that clemency which I have abuſed, is the beſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I can bring; thy grace and clemency, as reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Jeſus, the Son of thy love, the bleſſed recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciler of God and man.</p>

The ranſomed of the Lord ſhall join with me, while this glorious inſtance of thy grace excites their wonder, and my unbounded gratitude: thus ſhall thy glory be exalted.</p>
               <p>O Lord God, permit a poor worthleſs creature to plead a little with thee; what honour will my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction bring thee? What profit, what triumph to the Almighty will my perdition be? Mercy is thy brighteſt attribute; this gives thee all thy lovelineſs, and completes thy beauty. By names of kindneſs and indulgence thou haſt choſen to reveal thyſelf to men; by titles of the moſt tender import thou haſt made thyſelf known to my ſoul; titles which thou doſt not yet diſdain, but art ſtill compaſſionate and ready to pardon.</p>

               <p>If I muſt loſe thy <hi>favour,</hi> oh! let me forget what that word imports, and blot for ever from my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the joys that a ſenſe of thy love has excited: Let no traces of thoſe ſacred tranſports be left on my ſoul.</p>

               <p>OH! let not the Lord be angry, and I who am but duſt will ſpeak! Why doſt thou withdraw thyſelf, and ſuffer me to purſue thee in vain? If I am ſurrounded with thy immenſity, why am I thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of thee? Why do I not find thee, if thou art every where preſent? I ſearch thee in the temple, where thou haſt often met me; there I have ſeen the traces of thy majeſty and beauty; but thoſe ſacred viſions bleſs my ſight no more. I ſearch thee in my ſecret retirements, where I have called upon thy name, and have often heard the whiſpers of thy voice; that celeſtial converſation hath often reached and raptured my ſoul, but I am ſolaced no more with thoſe divine condeſcenſions; I liſten, but I hear thoſe gentle ſounds no more; I pine and languiſh, but thou flieſt me; ſtill I wither in thy abſence, as a drooping plant for the reviving ſun.</p>
               <p>O when wilt thou ſcatter this melancholy darkneſs? When ſhall the ſhadows flee before thee? When ſhall
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:022860_0066_0FBA9F3DD81FFAC8"/>
the cheerful glory of thy grace dawn upon my mind at thy approach? I ſhall revive at thy light? my vital ſpirits will confeſs thy preſence; grief and anxiety will vaniſh before thee, and immortal joys ſurround my ſoul.</p>
               <p>Where thou art preſent, heaven and happineſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue; hell and damnation fill the breaſt where thou art abſent. While God withdraws I am encompaſſed with darkneſs and deſpair; the ſun and ſtars ſhine with an uncomfortable luſtre, the faces of my friends grow tireſome; the ſmiles of angels would fail to cheer my languiſhing ſpirit. I grow unacquainted with tranquillity; peace and joy are empty ſounds to me, and words without a meaning.</p>
               <p>Tell me not of glory and pleaſure, there are no ſuch things without my God; while he withdraws, what delight can theſe trifles afford? All that amuſes man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, are but dreams of happineſs, ſhades and fantaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic appearances: What compenſation can they make for an infinite good departed? All nature cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair my loſs: Heaven and earth would offer their treaſures in vain; not all the kingdoms of this world, nor the thrones of archangels, could give me a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for an abſent God.</p>
               <p>O where can my grief find redreſs? whence can I draw ſatisfaction when the fountain of joy ſeals up its ſtreams? My ſorrows are hopeleſs till he return; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him my night will never ſee a dawn, but extend to everlaſting darkneſs: Content and joy will be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtrangers to my breaſt. Had I all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of creation to delight me, his frowns

would blaſt the whole enjoyment; unreconciled to God, my ſoul would be for ever at variance with itſelf.</p>
               <p>Even now, while I believe thy glory hid from me but with a tranſient eclipſe, while I wait for thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, as for the dawning day, my ſoul ſuffers inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible agonies at the delay; the minutes ſeem to linger, and days are lengthened into ages: But, Lord, what keener anguiſh ſhould I feel, did I think thy preſence had totally forſaken me, did I imagine thy glory ſhould no more ariſe on my ſoul? My ſpirits fail at the ſuppoſition; I cannot face the dreadful apprehenſions of my God for ever gone. Is it not hell in its moſt horrid proſpect? eternal darkneſs, and the undying worm, infinite ruin and irreparable dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age? Compared to this, what were all the plagues that earth could threaten, or hell invent? what is diſgrace, and poverty, and pain? what is all that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals fear, real or imaginary evils? they are nothing compared to the terrors which the thought of loſing my God excites.</p>
               <p>O thou, who art my boundleſs treaſure, my infinite delight, my all, my ineffable portion, can I part with thee? I may ſee without light, and breathe without air, ſooner than be bleſſed without my God. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs ſeparate from thee were a contradiction, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility (if I dare ſpeak it) to omnipotence itſelf. I feel a flame which the moſt glorious creation could not ſatisfy; an emptineſs which nothing but infinite love could fill. I muſt find thee, or weary myſelf in an eternal purſuit. Nothing ſhall divert me in the endleſs ſearch, no obſtacle ſhall fright me back, no

               <p>O GOD, when I ceaſe to love and praiſe thee, let me ceaſe to breathe and live; when I forget thee, let me forget the name of happineſs, and let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleaſing idea be razed from my memory. When thou art not my ſupreme delight, let all things elſe deceive me; let me grow unacquainted with peace, and ſeek repoſe in vain: let deluſions mock my gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hopes, let my deſires find no ſatisfaction, till they are terminated all in thee. When I forget the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions of thy love, O my God, let pleaſure be a ſtranger to my ſoul; when I prefer not that to my chiefeſt joy, let me be inſenſible of all delight; when thy benignity is not dearer to me than life, let that life become my burden and my pain.</p>
               <p>Search the inmoſt receſſes of my heart, and if thou findeſt any competitor there, remove the darling van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and blot every name but thine from my breaſt. Let me find nothing but emptineſs in the creature, when I forſake the all-ſufficient Creator: let the ſtreams be cut off, when I wander away and abandon

the fountain. Let me be deſtitute of aſſiſtance, when I ceaſe to rely on thee; let my lips be for ever ſilent, when they refuſe to acknowledge thy benefits, and make not thee the ſubject of their higheſt praiſe. Let no joyful ſtrain enter at my ears, when thy name is not the moſt delightful ſound they can convey to my heart.</p>
               <p>I have been pronouncing heavy curſes on myſelf, if thy love be not my chief bleſſing; yet, O my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good, my portion, and my only felicity, might I not go on farther ſtill, and even venture immortal joys on the ſincerity of my love to thee? Bleſſed Lord, forgive theſe dangerous efforts of a mortal tongue, which are the mere out-breakings of a fervent affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I could even dare to pledge all my hopes and my pretenſions to future happineſs, (and O let not my heart deceive me) I think I could riſk them all, if thou thyſelf art not the object of my brighteſt hopes, and the light of thy countenance the height of that expected happineſs.</p>
               <p>If I deſire any thing in heaven or on earth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of thee, I am almoſt ready to ſay, baniſh me as an eternal exile from the light of paradiſe: Even that paradiſe would be melancholy darkneſs without thee, and the obſcureſt corner of the creation, bleſſed with thy preſence, would be more agreeable. Oh! where could I be happy, remote from thee? what imaginable good could ſupply thy abſence? Say, O my God, do I not love thee?</p>

               <p>I love my friend; my vital breath and the light of heaven are dear to me: But ſhould I ſay I love my God as I love theſe, I ſhould belie the ſacred flame which aſpires to infinity.

Were the harps of angels ſilent, there would be harmony for me in the whiſpers of thy love: Were the fields of light darkened, thy ſmiles would bleſs me with everlaſting day; the viſion of thy face will attract my eyes, nor give me leiſure to waſte a look on other objects to all eternity, any farther than God is to be ſeen in his creatures.

What wonders, then, will the open viſion of thy face effect, when I ſhall enjoy it in ſo ſublime a

interval of their bliſs; aſk ſome radiant ſeraph, amidſt the fervency of his raptures, at what price he values his happineſs; and when theſe have named the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, earth and hell may try to balance mine. Let them ſpread the baits that tempt deluded men to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; let riches, honour, beauty, and bewitching plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure appear in all their charms, the ſenſuality of the preſent and paſt ages, the <hi>Perſian</hi> delicacy, and the <hi>Roman</hi> pride; let them uncover the golden mines, and diſcloſe the ruby ſparkling in its bed; let them open the veins of ſapphire, and ſhew the diamond glittering on its rock; let them all be thrown into the balance; alas! their weight is too little and too light.

               <p>O Death, where is thy ſting? where is thy boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed victory? The conqueſt is mine: I ſhall paſs in triumph through thy dark dominions, and through the grace of the Son of God, my divine leader, I ſhall appear there, not a captive, but a conqueror.</p>
               <p>O king of terrors, where are thy formidable looks? I can ſee nothing dreadful in thy aſpect: Thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareſt
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:022860_0079_0FBA9F59CE6B5090"/>
with no tokens of defiance, nor doſt thou come with ſummons from a ſevere judge; but gentle invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from my bleſſed Redeemer, who has paſſed gloriouſly through thy territories, in his way to his throne.</p>
               <p>Thrice welcome, thou kind meſſenger of my liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and happineſs! a thouſand times more welcome than jubilee to the wretched ſlave, than pardon to a condemned malefactor: I am going from darkneſs and confinement to immenſe light and perfect liberty: from theſe tempeſtuous regions to the ſoft and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful climes above; from pain and grief to everlaſting eaſe and tranquillity. For the toils of virtue, I ſhall immediately receive its vaſt rewards; for the reproach of fools, the honour and applauſe of angels. In a few minutes I ſhall be higher than yonder ſtars, and brighter far than they. I ſhall range the boundleſs ether, and breathe the balmy airs of paradiſe. I ſhall preſently behold my glorious Maker, and ſing hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs to my exalted Saviour.</p>
               <p>And now come, ye bright guardians of the juſt, conduct me through the unknown and trackleſs ether, for you paſs and repaſs the celeſtial road continually; you have commiſſion not to leave me till I arrive at <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the city of the living God; till I come to the innumerable company of angels, and the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect.</p>
               <p>Hold out, faith and patience; it is but a little while and your work will be at an end; but a few moments, and theſe ſighs and groans ſhall be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into everlaſting hallelujahs; but a few weary ſteps,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:022860_0080_0FBA9F5B0FC8C968"/>
and the journey of life will be finiſhed. One effort more, and I ſhall have gained the top of the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hills, and from yonder bright ſummit ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently look back on the dangers I have eſcaped in my travels through the wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>Roll faſter on, ye lingering minutes; the nearer my joys, the more impatient I am to ſeize them: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe painful agonies, how greedily ſhall I drink in immortal eaſe and pleaſure? Break away, ye thick clouds, be gone, ye envious ſhades, and let me behold the glories ye conceal: Let me ſee the promiſed land, and ſurvey the happy regions I am immediately to poſſeſs. How long will you interpoſe between me and my bright ſun, between me and the unclouded face of God? Look up, my ſoul, ſee how ſweetly thoſe reviving beams break forth; how they diſpel the gloom, and gild the ſhades of death.</p>
               <p>O bleſſed eternity; with what a cheerful ſplendor doſt thou dawn on my ſoul? With thee comes liberty, and peace, and love, and endleſs felicity; but pain, and ſorrow, and tumult, and death and darkneſs van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh before thee for ever. I am juſt upon the ſhores of thoſe happy realms, where uninterrupted day and eternal ſpring reſide: Yonder are the delectable hills and harmonious vales, which continually echo to the ſongs of angels. There the bliſsful fields extend their verdure, and there the immortal groves aſcend; but how dazzling is thy proſpect. O city of God, of whom ſuch glorious things are ſpoken? In thee <hi>there ſhall be no more night, nor need of the ſun or moon</hi>; for the throne of God and of the Lamb is in the midſt of
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:022860_0081_0FBA9F5C8EB23500"/>
thee, <hi>and the nations that are ſaved ſhall walk in thy light, and the kings of the earth ſhall bring their glory and honour into thee, and there the glorious Lord ſhall be to us a place of defence, a place of ſtreams and broad rivers,</hi> and the voice of joy, and the ſhout of triumph, ſhall be heard in thee for ever.</p>
               <l>There holy ſouls perpetual ſabbaths keep,</l>
               <l>And never are concern'd for food or ſleep:</l>
               <l>There new come ſaints with wreaths of light are crown'd,</l>
               <l>While ivory harps and ſilver trumpets ſound:</l>

               <l>And raptur'd cherubs loud reſponſes ſing.</l>
               <p>
                  <hi>My eyes ſhall there behold the King in his beauty,</hi> and oh! how raviſhing will the aſpect of his love be? What unutterable extaſies ſhall I feel, when I meet thoſe ſmiles which enlighten heaven, and exhilerate all the celeſtial regions? When I ſhall view the beatific glory without one interpoſing cloud to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? When I ſhall drink my fill at the fountains of joy, and in thoſe rivers of pleaſure that flow from his right hand for ever.</p>

               <p>MY all-ſufficient friend, <hi>my ſhield, and my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great reward!</hi> I have enough: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded avarice can covet nothing beyond thee; the

ſoul whom thou doſt not ſuffice, deſerves to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally poor. Thou art my ſupreme happineſs, my voluntary choice: I took thy love alone for my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in that bleſſed day when I entered into covenant with thee, and became thine: I made no articles with thee for the friendſhips, the honours and pleaſures of the world; but ſolemnly renounced them all, and choſe thy favour for my ſingle inheritance, leaving the conduct of my life entirely to thee.</p>
               <p>Theſe were my vows, and theſe I have often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; and ſhall I now retract ſuch ſacred obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and alter a choice ſo juſt and reaſonable? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it, gracious God! let me never be guilty of ſuch madneſs: The world has often diſappointed my moſt confident expectations, but thou haſt never deceived me. In all my diſtreſs I have found thee a certain refuge, <hi>my ſhield, my fortreſs, my high tower, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer, my rock, and he in whom I truſt.</hi> When there was none to ſave me, thy powerful hand has ſet me free; thou haſt redreſſed my grievances, and diſſipat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my fears; thou haſt brought me light out of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, and turned my darkneſs into day.</p>
               <p>When the world could afford me nothing but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt and diſorder, with thee I have found repoſe and undiſturbed tranquillity. Thou haſt been my long experienced refuge, my unfailing confidence, and I ſtedfaſtly depend on thee for my future conduct. I cannot err when guided by infinite wiſdom; I muſt be ſafe in the arms of eternal love, to which I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly reſign myſelf. Let me have riches or poverty, honour or contempt; whatever comes from thy hands
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:022860_0083_0FBA9F620B542968"/>
ſhall be thankfully received. I would hear no voice but thine, nor make a ſtep but where I am following thee.</p>
               <p>If thou wouldſt leave me to chuſe for myſelf, I would reſign the choice again to thee; I dread no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than the guidance of my own blind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; I tremble at the thought of ſuch a fatal liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Avert, gracious God, that miſerable freedom. Thou foreſeeſt all events, and at one ſingle view doſt look through eternal conſequences; therefore do thou determine my circumſtances, not to gratify my own wild deſires, but to advance thy glory.</p>
               <p>Thou haſt an unqueſtioned right to diſpoſe of me; I am thine by neceſſary ties, and voluntary engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which I thankfully acknowledge and ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renew: Deliberately and entirely I put myſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy hands. Whatever intereſt I have in this world I ſacrifice to thee, and leave my deareſt enjoyments to thy diſpoſal, acknowledging it my deareſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be guided by thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord, what is man, that thou art mindful of him?</hi> That thou, who art ſupremely bleſſed, and independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently happy, ſhouldſt concern thyſelf with human af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and condeſcend to make our wants as much thy care as if mortal miſeries could reach thee, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt immortal bleſſedneſs. Thou wouldſt make us ſenſible of thine indulgence by the moſt tender ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes: A father's gentle care but faintly ſhadows thine, and all we can conceive of human pity falls ſhort of thy compaſſion. Thou doſt ſeem to ſhare in our calamities, and ſympathize in all our grief. No

friend flies to our aſſiſtance with half the ſpeed that love brings thee, nor canſt thou ever want methods to relieve thoſe that confide in thee.</p>
               <p>Thy providence finds or makes its way through all oppoſitions: The ſtreams ſhall roll back to their fountains, the ſun ſhall ſtand ſtill, and the courſe of nature be reverſed, rather than thou want means to bring thy purpoſes to paſs. No obſtacle puts a ſtand to thy deſigns, nor obſtructs thy methods: It is thy will that makes nature and neceſſity: Who can ſtay thy hand, or ſay unto thee, <hi>What doſt thou?</hi> Thy counſel ſhall ſtand, and thou wilt do all thy pleaſure. Nothing is impoſſible for thee to accompliſh? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I caſt my eyes, I ſee inſtances of thy power: The extended firmament, the ſun and ſtars, tell me what thou art able to perform; they atteſt thy om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence, and rebuke my unbelief. The whole cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation pleads for thee, and condemns my infidelity.</p>
               <p>Almighty God, forgive my diffidence, while I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it is moſt inexcuſable. Thy hand is not ſhorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor are the ſprings of thy bounty ſealed; thy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient miracles have not exhausted thy ſtrength, nor hath perpetual beneficence impoveriſhed thee; thy power remains undiminiſhed, and thy mercy endureth for ever. That dazzling attribute ſurrounds me with tranſporting glories: Which way ſoever I turn, I meet the bright conviction; I cannot recal a day of my paſt life on which ſome ſignature of thy goodneſs is not ſtamped.</p>
               <l>Oh! who hath taſted of thy clemency</l>
               <l>In greater meaſure, or more oft than I?</l>

               <l>I ſee thy mercy and thy glory meet.</l>
               <p>In whatever thou haſt granted, or whatever thou haſt denied me, thy beneficence has been mingled with every diſpenſation; thou haſt not taken the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of my follies, nor been ſevere to my ſins; but haſt remembered my frame, and treated me with the utmoſt indulgence.

I welcomed its cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful luſtre, and felt the ſacred influence; the flames of holy love awoke, and holy joys were kindled.</p>
               <p>The earth and all its pageantry diſappeared like clouds before the morning ſun: The ſcenes of para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe were opened—ſeraphie pleaſures and unutterable delights: All hail, I cried, you unknown joys, you unexperienced pleaſures! compared to you, what is all I have reliſhed till now? what is earthly beauty and harmony? what is all that mortals call charming and attractive? I never lived till now: I knew no

               <head>XXVII. Breathing after God and weary of the World.</head>
               <l>'TIS no mean beauty of the ground</l>
               <l>That has allur'd my eyes:</l>
               <l>I ſaint beneath a nobler wound,</l>
               <l>Nor love below the ſkies.</l>
               <p>If words can reach the heights of love and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, let me pour out the ſecret ardour of my ſoul; O let it not offend thy greatneſs, that duſt and vanity adores and loves thee. If thou hadſt given me other capacities, and formed any thing more ſuitable to my wiſhes, I might have found a lower happineſs, and been content with ſomething below the infinite Deity; but the ſcanty creation affords nothing to ſatisfy me, and I follow thee by a divine inſtinct and mere neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of nature.</p>
               <p>My life is uſeleſs, and my being inſignificant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee: My reaſon has no proper employment; love, the nobleſt paſſion of my ſoul, has no object to anſwer its dignity. I am reduced to abſolute pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; my nature is entirely ruined; I am loſt, eternally loſt, undone, and abandoned to deſpair, if I am depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of thee. There can be no reparation made for an infinite loſs; nothing can be inſtead of God to my ſoul.</p>
               <p>I have willingly renounced all things elſe for thy ſake: All the ſentiments of tenderneſs and delight, that my ſoul ever feels for any earthly object, is mere
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:022860_0101_0FBA9DEBE77C42D8"/>
indifference, compared to my love for thee: and it grows into hatred when that object ſtands as thy ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val or competitor. This is the conquering, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior flame that draws in and ſwallows up all the other ardours of my nature. My engagements with all terreſtrial things are broken; the names of father, of brother, or of friend, are no more: abſtracted from thee, theſe tender titles give me neither confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, nor joy, and are mere inſignificant names, but as thou doſt give them an emphaſis; they are nothing at all without thee; and with thee, what finite good can be an addition?</p>
               <l>The ſoul can hold no more, for God is all,</l>
               <l>He only equals its capacious graſp,</l>
               <l>He only overfills to ſpaces infinite.</l>
               <p>Thou art my God, and I have enough; my ſoul is ſatisfied, I am entirely at reſt. Divide the vain, the periſhing creation, to the miſerable wretches that aſk no other portion: let them, unenvied, poſſeſs the honours, and riches, and pleaſures of the world; with a laviſh hand divide them away: theſe things are but as the duſt of the balance to the happy ſoul that knows what the light of thy countenance imports. After that there can be no reliſh left for the low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of mortality.</p>
               <l>Loſt in the high enjoyments of thy love,</l>
               <l>What glorious mortal could my envy move?</l>

have no ſentiment of pleaſure left but for you. My God revealing his glories and his graces in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> his Son, is ſufficient for my eternal entertainment.</p>
               <p>What if all former ideas of viſible things were wip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from my ſoul? what if I had no imagination, no memory, no traces left of any thing but the joys I have found in thy preſence, and the aſſurance of thy everlaſting favour? thoſe are the only paſt moments I recal with pleaſure, and oh! let all the vaſt eternity before me be ſpent in theſe ſatisfactions.</p>

               <p>O Lord God, great and holy, all-ſufficient, and full of grace, if thou ſhouldſt bid me form a wiſh, and take whatſoever in heaven or earth I had
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:022860_0106_0FBA9DF5357C2380"/>
to aſk, it ſhould not be the kingdoms of this world, nor the crowns of princes; no, nor ſhould it be the wreaths of martyrs, nor the thrones of arch-angels: My firſt requeſt is to be made holy; this is my high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt concern. Rectify the diſorders ſin has made in my ſoul, and renew thy image there; let me be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with thy likeneſs. Thou haſt compaſſed my paths with mercy in all other reſpects, and I am diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented with nothing but my own heart; becauſe it is ſo unlike the image of thy holineſs, and ſo unfit for thy immediate preſence.</p>
               <p>Permit me to be importunate here, O bleſſed God, and grant the importunity of my wiſhes; let me be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with a gracious and ſpeedy anſwer, for I am dying while I am ſpeaking: The very breath with which I am calling upon thee, is carrying away a part of my life: This tongue, that is now invoking thee, muſt ſhortly be ſilent in the grave: Theſe knees, that are bent to pay thee homage, and theſe hands, that are now lifted to the moſt high God for mercy, muſt ſhortly be mouldering to their original duſt: Theſe eyes will ſoon be cloſed in death, which are now look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to thy throne for a bleſſing. Oh! prevent the flying hours with thy mercy, and let thy favour outſtrip the haſty moments.</p>
               <p>Thou art unchanged, while rolling ages paſs along; but I am decaying, with every breath I draw: My whole allotted time to prepare for heaven is but a point, compared with thy infinite duration. The ſhortneſs and vanity of my preſent being, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of my eternal concerns, join together to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:022860_0107_0FBA9DF60FD982A8"/>
my utmoſt ſolicitude, and give wings to my warmeſt wiſhes. Before I can utter all my preſent deſires, the haſty opportunity perhaps is gone, the golden minute vaniſhed, and the ſeaſon of mercy has taken its everlaſting flight.</p>
               <p>Oh! God of ages, hear me ſpeedily, and grant my requeſt while I am yet ſpeaking; my frail exiſtence will admit of no delay; anſwer me according to the ſhortneſs of my duration, and the exigence of my cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. My buſineſs, of high importance as it is, yet is limited to the preſent NOW, the paſſing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for all the powers on earth cannot promiſe me the next.</p>
               <p>Let not my preſſing importunity, therefore, offend thee; my happineſs, my everlaſting happineſs, my whole being is concerned in my ſucceſs: As much as the enjoyment of God himſelf is worth, is at ſtake.</p>
               <p>Thou knoweſt, O Lord, what qualifications will fit me to behold thee; thou knoweſt in what I am defective; thou canſt prepare my ſoul in an inſtant, to enter into thy holy habitation: I breathe now, but the next moment may be death; let not that fatal moment come before I am prepared. The ſame cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating voice the ſaid, <hi>Let there be light,</hi> and there was light, can in the ſame manner purify and adorn my ſoul, and make me fit for thy own preſence; and my ſoul longs to be thus purified and adorned. O Lord, delay not, for every moment's interval is a loſs to me, and may be a loſs unſpeakable and unrepairable. Thy delay cannot be the leaſt advantage to thee; thy power and thy clemency are as full this preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:022860_0108_0FBA9DF7944A6D70"/>
as they will be the next, and my time as fleeting, and my wants as preſſing.</p>
               <p>Remember, O eternal God, my loſt time is for ever loſt, and my waſted hours will never return, my neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected opportunities can never be recalled; to me they are gone for ever, and cannot be improved; but thou canſt change my ſinful ſoul into holineſs, by a word, and ſet me now in the way to everlaſting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</p>
               <p>O let not the ſpirit of God reſtrain itſelf, but bleſs me according to the fulneſs of thy own being, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the riches of thy grace in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy infinite, unconceivable love, manifeſted in that glorious gift of thy beloved Son, wherein the fulneſs of the Godhead was contained: It is through his merit and mediation I humbly wait for all the unbounded bleſſings I want or aſk for.</p>

               <p>Thou didſt accompany Jacob in his journey to Padan-aran, and gave him bread to eat, and raiment to put on, till greatly increaſed in ſubſtance: He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned

to his father's houſe, he wreſtled for a bleſſing, he wreſtled with the Almighty, and prevailed.</p>
               <p>With Joſeph thou wenteſt down into Egypt, and didſt deliver him out of all his adverſities, till he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat his ſorrows, and all the toil of his father's houſe.</p>
               <p>Thou didſt remember thy people in the Egyptian bondage, and look with pitying eyes on their afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and after four hundred and thirty years, on the very day thou hadſt promiſed, didſt releaſe and bring them out with triumph and miracles. Thy preſence went with them in a pillar of a cloud by day, and a protecting fire by night: Thy conquering hand drove out great and potent nations, and gave them an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire poſſeſſion of the land promiſed to their fathers: Nor didſt thou fail in the leaſt circumſtance of all the good things thou hadſt promiſed.</p>
               <p>What a cloud of witneſſes ſtand on record! Joſhua and Gideon, Jephtha and Sampſon, who through faith obtained promiſes.</p>
               <p>Thou didſt command the ravens to feed thy holy prophet; and at the word of a prophet, didſt ſuſtain the widow's family with a handful of meal.</p>
               <p>Thou didſt walk with the three Hebrews in the fiery furnace: Thou waſt preſent with Daniel in the lion's den, to deliver him, becauſe he truſted in thee.</p>
               <p>In what inſtance has the prayer of faith been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected? Where were the righteous forſaken? Who can charge God without charging him fooliſhly? What injuſtice has been found in the Judge of all the earth? His glorious titles have ſtood unblemiſhed from generation to generation; nor can any of his perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

decay, or rolling years make a change on the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of days.</hi>

               <p>Are not his words clear and diſtinct, without a double meaning, or the leaſt deceit? Are they not ſuch as may juſtly ſecure my confidence? Such as would ſatisfy me from the mouth of man, unconſtant man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, and his founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the duſt, unſtable as water, and fleeting as a ſhadow? And can I ſo ſlowly aſſent to the words of the Moſt High? Shall I truſt impotent man, that has neither wiſdom nor might to accompliſh his deſigns, that cannot call the next breath or motion his own, nor promiſe himſelf a moment in all futurity? Can I reſt on theſe feeble props; and yet tremble and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond when I have the veracity of the eternal God to ſecure and ſupport me?</p>
               <p>I know he will not break his covenant, nor ſuffer his faithfulneſs to fail: I dare atteſt it in the face of earth and hell, I dare ſtake my all for time and eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on this glorious truth; a truth which hell cannot blemiſh, nor all its malice contradict.</p>
               <p>Exert yourſelves, ye powers of darkneſs, bring in your evidence, collect your inſtances, begin from the firſt generation, ſince the world was peopled, and men began to call on the name of the Lord; when did they call in vain? When did the Holy One of Iſrael fail the expectation of the humble and contrite ſpirit? Point out in your blackeſt characters the diſmal peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, when the name of the Lord was no more a refuge to them that truſted in him? Let the annals of hell be produced, let them mark the dreadful day, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish it with eternal triumphs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="unknown:022860_0120_0FBA9E0EEC9F7258"/>In vain you ſearch; for neither heaven, nor earth, nor hell, have ever been witneſs to the leaſt deviation from truth or juſtice. The Almighty ſhines with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſhed glory, to the confuſion of hell, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of thoſe that put their truſt in him.</p>
               <p>On thy eternal truth and honour I entirely caſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? if I am deceived, I am deceived: Angels and arch-angels are deluded too; they, like me, have no dependence beyond the divine veracity for their bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and immortality; they hang all their hopes on his goodneſs and immutability; if that fails, the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial paradiſe vaniſhes, and all its glories are extinct; the golden palaces ſink, and the ſeraphic thrones muſt totter and fall. Where are your crowns, ye ſpirits elect; where are your ſongs and your triumphs, if the truth of God can fail? A mere poſſibility of that would darken the fields of light, and turn the voice of melody into grief and lamentation.</p>
               <p>What pangs would riſe, even through all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of bleſſedneſs, what diffidence and fear would ſhake the heart of every inhabitant, what agonies ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them all, could the word of the moſt high God be cancelled? The pillars of heaven might then trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the everlaſting mountains bow, the celeſtial foundations might be moved from their place, and that nobleſt ſtructure of the hands of God be chaos, and eternal emptineſs.</p>
               <p>But for ever <hi>juſt and true are thy ways, thou King of ſaints; bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in thee;</hi> for thou art a certain refuge in the day of diſtreſs, and under the ſhadow of thy wings I will rejoice. <hi>My

               </head>
               <p>I AM now ſetting to my ſeal that God is true, and leaving this as my laſt teſtimony to the divine ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity. I can from numerous experiences aſſert his faithfulneſs, and witneſs to the certainly of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. <hi>The word of the Lord is tried, and he is a buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to all thoſe that put their truſt in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O come, all you that fear the Lord, and I will tell you what he has done for my ſoul; I will aſcribe righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to my Maker,</hi> and leave my record for a people yet unborn; that the generation to come may riſe up and praiſe him.</p>
               <p>Into whatever diſtreſs his wiſe providence has brought me, I have called on the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears; I truſted in God, and he ſaved me. Oh! let my experience ſtand
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:022860_0124_0FBA9E16567392E8"/>
a witneſs to them that hope in his mercy; let it be to the Lord for a praiſe and a glory.</p>
               <p>I know not where to begin the recital of thy nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous favours. Thou haſt hid me in the ſecret of thy pavilion, from the pride of man, and from the ſtrife of tongues, when by a thouſand follies I have merited reproach: Thou haſt graciouſly protected me, when the vanity of my friends, or the malice of my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, might have ſtained my reputation: Thou haſt covered me with thy feathers, and under thy wings have I truſted: Thy truth has been my ſhield and my buckler; the thee I owe the bleſſing of a clear and unblemiſhed name, and not my own conduct, nor the partiality of my friends.—Glory be to thee, O Lord.</p>
               <p>Thou haſt led me through a thouſand labyrinths, and enlightened my darkneſs. When ſhades and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity ſurrounded me, my light has broke forth out of obſcurity, and my darkneſs been turned into noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. Thou haſt been a guide and a father to me. When I knew not where to aſk advice, thou haſt given me unerring counſel: <hi>The ſecret of the Lord has been with</hi> me, and he <hi>has ſhewn me his covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In how many ſeen and unſeen dangers haſt thou delivered me? How narrow my gratitude? How wide thy mercy? How innumerable are thy thoughts of love? How infinite the inſtances of thy goodneſs? How high above the ways and thoughts of man?</p>
               <p>How often haſt thou ſupplied my wants, and by thy bounty confounded my unbelief? Thy benefits have ſurprized and juſtly reproached my diffidence;
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:022860_0125_0FBA9E17D1924E68"/>
my faith has often failed, but thy goodneſs has never failed. The world and all its flatteries have failed, my own heart and hopes have failed, but thy mercy endures for ever, thy faithfulneſs has never failed.</p>
               <p>The ſtrength of <hi>Iſrael</hi> has never deceived me, nor made me aſhamed of my confidence. Thou haſt never been as a deceitful brook, or as waters that fail, to my ſoul.</p>
               <p>In loving kindneſs, in truth, and in very faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thou haſt afflicted me: Oh! how unwillingly haſt thou ſeemed to grieve me? With how much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence has the puniſhment been mixed? Love has appeared through the diſguiſe of every frown: Its beams have glimmered through the darkeſt night; by every affliction thou haſt been ſtill drawing me nearer to thyſelf, and removing my carnal props, that I may lean with more aſſurance on the eternal rock.</p>
               <p>Thy love has been my leading glory from the firſt intricate ſteps of life: The firſt undeſigning paths I trod were marked and guarded by the vigilance of thy love: Oh! whither elſe had my ſin and folly led me?</p>
               <p>How often have I tried and experienced thy cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, and found an immediate anſwer to my prayers? Thou haſt often literally fulfilled thy word: I have a freſh inſtance of thy faithfulneſs again: Thou haſt made me triumph in thy goodneſs, and given a new teſtimony to the veracity of thy promiſes.</p>
               <p>And after all, what ingratitude, what inſenſibility reigns in my heart! Oh! cancel it by the blood of the covenant: Root out this monſtrous infidelity that ſtill returns after the fulleſt evidence of thy truth.
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:022860_0126_0FBA9E1B43CECAE0"/>
Thou haſt graciouſly condeſcended to anſwer me in my own time and way, and yet I am again doubting thy faithfulneſs and care. <hi>Lord,</hi> pity me, <hi>I believe, O help my unbelief.</hi> Go on to ſuccour, go on to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and at laſt conquer my diffidence. Let me hope againſt hope, and in the greateſt perplexity give glory to God, by believing what my own experience has ſo often found—<hi>That the ſtrength of</hi> Iſrael <hi>will not lie; nor is he as man, that he ſhould repent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While I have memory and thought, let his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dwell on my ſoul. Let me not forget the depth of my diſtreſs, the anguiſh and importunity of my vows: When every human help failed, and all was darkneſs and perplexity, then God was all my ſtay. Then I knew no name but his, and he alone knew my ſoul in adverſity. Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and forget not all his benefits.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Long as I live I'll bleſs thy name,</l>
                  <l>My King, and God of love;</l>

               <p>I have yet a thouſand, and ten thouſand deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances to recount, ten thouſand unaſked-for mercies to recal: No moment of my life has been deſtitute of thy care, no accident has found me unguarded by thy watchful eye, or neglected by thy providence.
