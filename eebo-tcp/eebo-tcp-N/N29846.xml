            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>An Introduction in order to an Expoſition upon the 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> of the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>John.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BUt before we enter upon the Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, let us premiſe theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars: In the firſt place
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:039690_0002_10143ADEF54B6AD8"/>
let us take Notice, this Firſt <hi>Chap.</hi> is an Epiſtle written by it ſelf, diſtinct from the reſt of the Book; and not written Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> as the reſt of the Book is, as appears Verſe 1ſt, <hi>That which we have ſeen,</hi> Verſe 2nd, <hi>For the life was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, and we have ſeen it:</hi> Verſe 3d, <hi>That which we have ſeen,</hi> Verſe 4th, <hi>And theſe things write we unto you,</hi> Verſe 5th, <hi>This then is the meſſage which we have heard of him, and declare unto you:</hi> thus it appears to be written Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitively; that is, by more than by the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> in uſing the word We.</p>
               <p>But the reſt of the Books, is written. Singularly by the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> as appears, Chap. 2.1. <hi>Theſe things write I unto you,</hi> verſe 7th, <hi>I write no new commandment unto you,</hi> and ſo through out the book; as appears in the laſt Chap. verſe 13. <hi>Theſe things have I writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten unto you, that believe on the name of the Son of God.</hi> Thus it appears, that the ſecond Chapter to the end of the Book is a ſecond Epiſtle, written to believers in the Light, to encourage them to continue in that State; and written by the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> in his own name Singularly, in Saying; <hi>I write unto you,</hi> not uſing the word we, as he doth in the firſt Chapter.</p>
               <p>A Second thing to be obſerved, is, That as
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:039690_0002_10143ADEF54B6AD8"/>
the firſt Chapter contains a diſtinct Epiſtle from the reſt of the Book; So it is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to perſons in the ſame State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as the other part of the Book is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to: for the firſt 4 Verſes of this Chap. is written to the Sinful World, or to ſuch as were not in fellowſhip with the Children of God, as appears in the 3d and 4th Verſes. <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard declare we unto you, that ye alſo may have fellowſhip with us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And theſe things write we unto you,</hi> &amp;c. And the other 6 Verſes, contains a Meſſage ſent from God, and directed to ſuch, as had loſt Sight of their Calling and Election, &amp; were in a State of darkneſs, with the reſt of the world; having wandred from the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Fellowſhip which once they were in with God: and the meſſage from God was, and is, to reduce and bring them back to God again, by repentance and confeſſion of their Sins; that thereby they might obtain forgiveneſs of them, and ſo come to be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from all Sin, as thoſe were that walked in the light: as God is in the Light, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the 7th verſe.</p>
               <p>And <hi>thirdly</hi> we may obſerve, that the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> in Chap. 2.1. begins his own Epiſtle in his own name, thus; <hi>My lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children theſe things write I unto you,</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:039690_0003_10143AE09F7E60C0"/>
ſo goes on in his writing, from babes in Chriſt, to young men and Fathers in Chriſt, yea, unto all Sorts and degrees of Chriſtians, who were in the light. But the firſt Chap. contains a particular Epiſtle written in the Pluralitive; that is in the name of many, or in the name of all the Children of God, who were in the light, as God is in the light; who were cleanſed by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt from all Sin, as appears in the 7 verſe, and by them directed to the World, and to them that were in a State of Sin and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as appears in the 5th and 6th verſes.</p>

who had this unction, knew the truth of <hi>Johns</hi> writing: but theſe Anti-chriſts knew not the truth of it, and therefore would not believe this Doctrine; as appears in the 6th verſe of ſaid 4th Chapter. <hi>He that is not of God heareth not us.</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, and they not hearing us, in this our teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Gods dwelling and abiding in us, who is greater in us, than he that is in the world: <hi>hereby</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, in this 6th verſe, <hi>know we the Spirit of truth, and the Spirit of errour;</hi> for he that is in the Spirit of truth will confeſs this Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine to be truth: becauſe his Faith is from a ſight of Jeſus Chriſts coming into his body of fleſh, and is a preſent help and deliverer out of Sin, and from the Power of Satan, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves whether ye be in the Faith, prove your own ſelves: know you not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.</hi> For if your faith be not from this ſight of Chriſt in you; ye are yet in your Sins, and your Faith is only the hypocrites Faith: or the Faith of thoſe Anti-chriſts, that believe only in the Son of man a great way off in the viſible heavens; who know nothing of the Power of God: tho' they have a faith of Chriſt in our nature, up in

               <p>Theſe are undeniably Hypocrites, and Counterfeits fore-told off by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, that ſhould appear in theſe laſt days; and deceive the very elect if it were poſſible, by their hypocritical lying ſigns and wonders to deceive.</p>
               <p>And therefore as we have taken a view of their deceiving Doctrine; let us in the next place take a view of their contrary practice to the Doctrine of Chriſt and his holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, to ſeduce and deceive the very elect if it were poſsible: and therefore let us take a view of the Doctrine of Chriſt; to ſee how contrary they Act to it, which may be ſeen by their Synagogue prayers, and trumpet ſounding alms, or publick Synagogue contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions, and hypocritical faſts.
