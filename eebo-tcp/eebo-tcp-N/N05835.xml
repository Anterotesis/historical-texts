            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> Map, that theſe Sheets accompany, and that they are intended to explain and ſupply, is preſented to the Public, when a longer Time was indeed neceſſary to have given it the Degree of Correctneſs that was intended it. But the preſent Conjuncture of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in America, and the generous Aſſiſtance of the Aſſembly of Penſilvania, have brought it to Light, when the Public will, it is hoped, receive Advantages from it, that will render an Apology for its premature Publication needleſs; and think it wortby the Encouragement of a <hi>BODY</hi> who devote the Public Money to the Public Service.</p>
            <p>IT comprizes ſuch an Extent, as is connected with that very valuable Country on the OHIO, which is now the Object of the Britiſh and French Policy, and the different Routes of both Nations thither. The Lake Ontario is equally open to both; to the one by the River St. Laurence; to the other by the Rivers Hudſon, Mohocks and Seneca. But the French hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thirty Years ago, fixed themſelves on the Streights of Niagara, by building Fortreſſes on Lands confeſſedly Britiſh, ſecured the Key on that Side to all the Country Weſtward. Thoſe in Power ſee at laſt its Conſequence, and are projecting the Recovery of it; and with great Judgment, for that Purpoſe, are eſtabliſhing a naval Force on Lake Ontario, as very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in the Recovery and Securing of it. The Iſſue of this Enterprize will have great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on our Affairs, and of all Things it becomes the Colonies to puſh it on with Vigour. If they ſucceed here, the Remainder of the Work will be eaſy; and Nothing ſo, without it. The Engliſh have ſeveral Ways to Ohio; but far the beſt is by Potomack.</p>
            <p>BY Reaſon of the little Acquaintance the Public has with theſe remoter Parts, where the Country is yet a Wilderneſs, and the Neceſſity of knowing the Ways of Travelling there, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by Water: In the Map is pointed out the <hi>Nature of the</hi> ſeveral <hi>Streams;</hi> as where rapid, gentle or obſtructed with Falls, and conſequently more or leſs fitted for Inland Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Canoes, Boats or larger Veſſels; and where the <hi>Portages</hi> are made at the Falls, or from one River, Creek or Lake to another. And for diſtinguiſhing the Extent of the Marine <hi>Navigation,</hi> the Places, that the <hi>Tide</hi> reaches, in the ſeveral Rivers, are pointed out. And in theſe Sheets, both the Marine and Inland Navigation are treated of at Length.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:007411_0003_102BAF198F8C50F0"/>
AS the Natures of the Soil and Streams depend upon the <hi>Elevation and Depreſſion of the Land;</hi> I have particularly explained here the different Stages that it is divided into. It were to be wiſht, that we had like Accounts of all Countries; as ſuch would diſcover to us great Regularity, where an unattentive Obſerver would imagine there was Nothing but Confuſion; and at the ſame Time explain the Climates, the Healthineſs, the Produce and Conveniencies for Habitations, Commerce and Military Expeditions, to a judicious Reader in a few Pages, better than Volumes of Remarks on Places, drawn without theſe Diſtinctions.</p>
            <p>TO render this Map uſeful in Commerce, and the Aſcertaining the Boundaries of Lands, the Time of <hi>High-Water,</hi> at the Full and Change of the Moon, and the <hi>Variation of the Magnetical Needle</hi> are laid down. But as theſe deſerve particular Explanations, I have, for want of Room, concluded to treat of them at large in a ſeparate Eſſay.</p>
            <p>ALONG the Weſtern Margin of the Map is drawn a Line repreſenting the <hi>greateſt Lengths of Days and Nights</hi> (without Allowance for the Refraction) which will aſſiſt Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, in forming ſome Judgment of the Latitude of Places, by the Help of their Watches only.</p>
            <p>THOUGH many of theſe Articles are almoſt peculiar to the Author's Maps, they are of no leſs Importance than any Thing, that has yet had a Place amongſt Geographers. But Want of Room in the Plate, has obliged me to leave out, what would have very much aſſiſted my Explanation of the Face of the Country, I mean <hi>a Section of it in ſeveral Directions;</hi> ſuch would have exhibited the Riſing and Falling of the Ground, and how elevated above the Surface of the Sea; what Parts are level, what rugged; where the Mountains riſe, and how far they ſpread. Nor is this all that a perpendicular Section might be made to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; for, as on the upper Side, the Elevations, Depreſſions, outer Appearances and Names of Places may be laid down; on the lower, the Nature of the Soil, Subſtrata and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Foſſils may be expreſt. It was with Regret I was obliged to omit it. But in ſome future Maps of ſeparate Colonies, I hope to be furniſhed with more Room.</p>
            <p>THE preſent, late, and antient <hi>Seats of the original Inhabitants</hi> are expreſſed in the Map; and though it might be imagined that ſeveral Nations are omitted, which are mentioned by Authors, it may be remarked, that Authors, for Want of Knowledge in Indian Affairs, have taken every little Society for a ſeparate Nation; whereas they are not truly more in Number than I have laid down. I have been ſomething particular in theſe Sheets in repreſenting the Extent of the Country of the <hi>Confederates</hi> or <hi>Five Nations;</hi> becauſe, whatever is ſuch, is expreſly acceded to the Engliſh by Treaty with the French.</p>

            <p>As different Parts of this Map are done with very different Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Exactneſs, Juſtice to the Public, requires my diſtinguiſhing the Degree of Credit every Part deſerves; and to make ſome recompenſe for the Defects of thoſe Places, where no actual Surveys have been yet made, by giving ſuch a Deſcription as the Nature of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject will admit; which may, at this Time, be of as much Conſequence as the niceſt Surveys deſtitute of this Advantage.</p>
            <p>THE Britiſh Settlements are done, for the greater Part, from actual Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys.
<note place="margin">Latitudes. Longitude of Boſton and Philadelphia agree.</note> The Latitudes of many Places taken with good Inſtruments, and the Longitudes of Philadelphia and Boſton, obſerved by different Perſons, and well agreeing, give a Foundation for the Projection of the Map. And as Philadelphia is a fine City, ſituate near the Center of the Britiſh Dominions on this Continent, and whether inferior to others in Wealth, or Number of Houſes, or not, it far excels in the Progreſs of Letters, mechanic Arts, and the public Spirit of its Inhabitants; Reaſons ſufficient for paying it the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Diſtinction of making it the firſt Meridian of America.
<note place="margin">Philadelphia made the firſt Meridian.</note> And a Meridian here I thought the more neceſſary, that we may determine the Difference of the Longitude of Places by Menſuration; a Method far excelling the beſt aſtronomical Obſervations; and as we may be led into ſeveral Errors by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways reckoning from remote Meridians. Thoſe who have only ſeen the Plans and Maps of this City, muſt be cautioned not to give any of them Credit, for it extends only on the Weſt Side of Delaware, about a Mile and a Half in Length, and about Half a Mile in the greateſt Breadth. Near the Weſtern Extremity is the Statehouſe, the Spot propoſed for my Meridian to be drawn through.</p>

THE Settlements made by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are bounded on one Side by the Ocean, and on the other by no certain Line or Diſtance; for in ſome Places they are not above 30 or 40 Miles from the Heads of Tide, and in others 150 or 200. In general, they may be conſidered as extended to No. 4

            <p>THO' there have been many other Obſervations made in ſeveral Places, in the Settlements, I have always choſen to adjuſt their Situations by the actual Menſurations; becauſe many of the Inſtruments yet uſed, are not ſufficiently accurate to determine the Latitude of Places with Nicety.</p>
            <p>A MAP I publiſhed of <hi>PENSILVANIA, NEW-JERSEY, NEW-YORK,</hi>

In the firſt Impreſſion of my former Map I committed ſome Miſtakes in the Names of Places, near
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007411_0007_102BAF218E5AE958"/>the Entrance of Delaware Bay on the Weſt Side
<note n="§" place="margin">H d</note>,

I have ſince had an Opportunity of making a thorough Enquiry into this Affair, and conclude, that the Names that the Places thereabouts are now called by, and are the ſame as laid down in my General Map, are the only Names they ever had, and ſtill retain amongſt thoſe acquainted with them; as Lewes, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kill Road, Cape Hinlopen, Falſe Cape, and Fenwick's Iſland: Excepting, that Mr. WILLIAM PENN called Cape Hinlopen by the Name of Cape <hi>James;</hi> and Whorekill <hi>Lewes,</hi> on his firſt Arrival in 1682; the former is ſcarce known at this Day, and the Name <hi>Lewes</hi> is confined to the Town, while the Creek ſtill retains the Name of the <hi>Whorekill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALL muſt admit that the preſent Names are rightly laid down; but what is related in regard to the antient Names muſt be underſtood as only my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. There are others, who think, on no leſs Opportunity of forming a Judgment, that Cape Hinlopen was formerly called Cape Cornelius; and that <hi>Fenwick's Iſland</hi> was the <hi>Falſe Cape,</hi> or <hi>Cape Hinlopen,</hi> of the Dutch, and others, till the Arrival of the Engliſh in thoſe Parts under Mr. PENN.</p>
            <p>To complete what was left imperfect in my former Map, eſpecially in <hi>New-York,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. William Alexander's Aſſiſtance.</note>, I have been in a particular Manner aſſiſted by Mr. WILLIAM ALEXANDER, whoſe numerous Obſervations and Collections add greatly to the Merit of this Part of the preſent One, as it will Authority with all who know him.</p>
            <p>BESIDES a general Map of Connecticut, which the Rev. Mr. CLAP fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured me with,
<note place="margin">Authorities for the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Colonies.</note> I have been aſſiſted in drawing the <hi>EASTERN CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LONIES</hi> by Memorials preſerved in DOUGLAS'S Summary of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony Lines, as actually run round three Sides of <hi>CONNECTICUT</hi> and <hi>RHODE-ISLAND,</hi> and between <hi>NEW-HAMPSHIRE</hi> and <hi>MASSACHUSET;</hi> and the Extenſion of theſe Lines in two Places to Hudſon's River. As for that, ſaid to be run from Deerfield to this River, there is certainly a Miſtake of ſeveral Miles in the Length of it. Theſe, with ſeveral Surveys by Meſſieurs HELM, KELLOG, and CHANDLER, amongſt which is an entire One of Connecticut River from No. 4
<note n="‖" place="margin">C b</note> to the North Side of Connecticut Colony
<note n="¶" place="margin">D b</note>, given me by Mr. POWNALL, together with his own itinerary Obſervations on the Face of the Country, the Ranges and Bearings of the Hills, and Diſtances of Places, contribute to give theſe Parts a great Degree of Exactneſs. Nor am I obliged, in theſe Parts alone, to this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, but for the Corrections of many Articles, which had eſcaped me in the former Map, and ſome other valuable Papers he procured me.</p>
            <p>THE greateſt Part of <hi>VIRGINIA</hi> is compoſed with the Aſſiſtance of Meſſieurs FRY and JEFFERSON'S Map of it;
<note place="margin">Fry and Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon's Map of Virginia.</note> and as this had the Aſſiſtance of actual Surveys of the Diviſion Line with <hi>Carolina,</hi> and of the Rivers <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pahannock</hi> and <hi>Potomack,</hi> from their Entrances to their Heads, joined to the Experience of two ſkilful Perſons, it would have been Affectation to have
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007411_0008_102BAF231158F2D0"/>omitted the Advantage of it. But however, an actual Survey from Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia to the Mountains, near the great Bent of Potomack, by the Penſilvania Surveyors in 1739, enabled me to give the juſt Longitude of that Place from Philadelphia, which they miſtook by 10 or 12 Miles; and this obliges me to give Potomack, and the whole Country, a Poſition ſomething different. As that Performance is very valuable, I contrived mine to interfere as little as Poſſible with it; and omitted the Counties and numerous Gentlemens Seats that it contains, to give Room for the Roads, Inſpection-houſes, Court-houſes, and the Seats of ſome Half a Dozen Gentlemen, noted in the literary Way.</p>
            <p>I AM obliged to the ſame Map,

HOXTON'S Chart of <hi>Cheſopeak</hi> Bay, for <hi>MARILAND.</hi> But this Colony is the worſt done of all the Settlements in mine, yet the Bay from Annapolis to the Head I have lately had an Opportunity of adjuſting; as well as to meaſure the Iſthmus acroſs from the Head of Elk to Delaware River, about three Miles below New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Caſtle. There is a conſiderable Error in my General Map, which came Time enough to my Knowledge to be mentioned here, tho' not to be recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and that is, the Breadth of the Peninſula from Fenwick's Iſland to the South Side of Little Choptank, which I make 65 Miles, whereas Mr. PAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SONS, one of the Surveyors, who ran the Line acroſs, informs me, that it ſhould have been 70.</p>

            <p>To recount all the Surveys of Roads, Tracts of Land and general Lines,
<note place="margin">The Author's Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of Aſſiſtance given him.</note> that I have been favoured with, in the Compoſition of my former Map, which makes ſo conſiderable a Part of this, would be endleſs: But I muſt not omit here to repeat, with Gratitude, my Thanks, not only for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours many Gentlemen did me, but the Chearfulneſs they ſhewed in aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Deſign intended for public Service. It would have been almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to have ſucceeded in the Compoſition,
<note place="margin">Such Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly neceſſary in America; and why.</note> notwithſtanding all theſe Helps, without my perſonal Knowledge alſo of almoſt all the Country it contained. One of the greateſt Miſtakes in it aroſe, from my going from Kinderhook to Albany by Night, where the Skipper deceived me in the Diſtance. An Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean may be at a Loſs to know, why there is a Neceſſity for theſe Sorts of Helps in making a Map of a Country; for that Reaſon it muſt be obſerved, that all America, Eaſt of Miſſiſippi, low Lands, Hills and Mountains, is every where covered with Woods, except ſome interval Spots of no great Extent, cleared by the European Colonets. Here are no Churches, Towers, Houſes or peaked Mountains to be ſeen from afar, no Means of obtaining the Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or Diſtances of Places, but by the Compaſs, and actual Menſuration with the Chain.
<note place="margin">All the Mountains alike.</note> The Mountains are almoſt all ſo many Ridges with even Tops, and nearly of a Height. To look from theſe Hills into the lower Lands, is but, as it were, into an Ocean of Woods, ſwelled and depreſt
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007411_0009_102BAF261C8982F0"/>here and there by little Inequalities, not to be diſtinguiſhed, one Part from another, any more than the Waves of the real Ocean.</p>
            <p>THE Uniformity of theſe Mountains,
<note place="margin">Their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</note> tho' debarring us of an Advantage in this Reſpect, makes ſome Amends in another. They are very regular in their Courſes, and confine the Creeks and Rivers that run between; and if we know where the Gaps are, that let through theſe Streams, we are not at a Loſs to lay down their moſt conſiderable Inflections.</p>
            <p>FOR the better underſtanding the Authorities whereon the reſt of the Map is founded,
<note place="margin">The Land is divided into different Stages.</note> it muſt be previouſly obſerved, that the Land, in the Parts of America included in this Map, is divided into different Stages; and that Hudſon's River divides the whole into two Series, both running parallel to the Sea.
<note place="margin">Hudſon's Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver divides the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two <hi>Series.</hi>
               </note> That to the Eaſtward is ſo to the Maſſachuſets Bay; at firſt its Direction is nearly North,
<note place="margin">The Eaſtern Series.</note> and then it trends more and more Eaſterly, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Shape of the Shore. This Series conſiſts of two Stages; and (ſuppoſing you travel acroſs it Weſtward from Boſton) the firſt begins about Water Town
<note n="§" place="margin">D a</note>,
<note place="margin">Its firſt Stage.</note> and continues a rough hilly Ground till you are paſt <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">A Place ſo called.</note>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">D b</note>; thence to within twenty Miles of Hudſon's River, the ſecond Stage is for a great Part covered with ſmall Mountains, running here in long Chains and Ridges;
<note place="margin">Second Stage.</note> which extend Southerly to the Sound dividing Long Iſland from the Main, and form thoſe Cliffs, Ridges and broken ſtony Ground, which you obſerve in travelling along the Connecticut Colony Shore
<note n="†" place="margin">E b</note>, and prevent the Poſſibility of making a better Road in that Direction further within Land. The greater Part of Connecticut is of this ſecond Stage, and is enriched by the fine interval Lands between the Chains, the greateſt being along the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut River, and near 20 Miles wide. 'Tis the Courſes of theſe Chains of Mountains and Hills that give Direction to the ſeveral Creeks and Rivers.
<note place="margin">Gathered Land.</note> To the Eaſtward of the firſt Stage, ſome Land is made by an Accumulation of Sand from the Ocean, heaped together by the Meeting of the Recoil of the Flood Tide from the North Eaſtward with another from the South Eaſtward; and forms near all the Land of Cape Cod to the Eaſtward of the Bottom of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets Bay.
<note place="margin">Cape Cod.</note> There are in this Series ſome few other Gatherings of Sand, but ſcarce worth the mentioning here.
<note place="margin">Long-Iſland.</note> As for the outer Part of <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſts of both Sand from the Ocean and Soil waſht from the Continent, thrown into this Shape by the Direction given the Tides and Cunents by the adjacent Coaſts.</p>
            <p>THE Land,
<note place="margin">The Weſtern Series.</note> South Weſtward of Hudſon's River, is more regularly divided, and into a greater Number of Stages than the other. The firſt Object worthy Regard, in this Part, is a Rief or Vein of Rocks, of the Talky or Iſinglaſſy Kind, ſome two or throe, or Half a Dozen Miles broad; riſing generally ſome ſmall Matter higher than the adjoining Land; and extending from New-York City South Weſterly by the Lower Falls of Delaware, Schuylkill, Suſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanna, Gun-Powder, Patapſco, Potomack, Rapahannock, James River and Ronoak. This was the antient maritime Boundary of America, and forms a
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007411_0010_102BAF284FBC2ED8"/>very regular Curve. The Land between this Rief and the Sea, and from the Nàveſink Hills South Weſtward as far as this Map extends, and probably to the Extremity of Georgia, may be denominated the <hi>Lower Plains,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of Soil waſht down from above,
<note place="margin">Firſt Stage, or Lower Plains.</note> and Sand accumulated from the Ocean. Where theſe Plains are not penetrated by Rivers, they are a white Sea-Sand, about twenty Feet deep, and perfectly barren, as no Mixture of Soil helps to enrich them. But the Borders of the Rivers, which deſcend from the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, are rendered fertile by the Soil waſht down with the Floods, and mixt with the Sand gathered from the Sea. The Subſtratum of Sea Mud, Shells and other foreign Subjects, is a perfect Confirmation of this Suppoſition. And hence it is, that for 40 or 50 Miles inland, and all the Way from the Nave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finks to Cape Florida, all is a perfect Barren, where the Waſh from the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land has not enriched the Borders of the Rivers; or ſome Ponds and Defiles have not furniſhed proper Support for the Growth of White Cedars. There is commonly a Vein of Clay ſeaward of the Iſinglaſſy Rief, ſome three or four Miles wide; which is a coarſe Fullers Earth, and excellently fitted, with a proper Portion of Loam, to make Bricks of.</p>
            <p>FROM this Rief of Rocks,
<note place="margin">Second Stage, or the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> over which all the Rivers fall, to that Chain of broken Hills, called the South Mountain, there is the Diſtance of 50, 60 or 70 Miles of very uneven Ground, riſing ſenſibly as you advance further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and may be denominated the <hi>Upland.</hi> This conſiſts of Veins of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Kinds of Soil and Subſtrata, ſome Scores of Miles in Length; and in ſome Places overlaid with little Ridges and Chains of Hills. The Declivity of the whole gives great Rapidity to the Streams; and our violent Guſts of Rain have waſht it all into Gullies, and carried down the Soil to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Borders of the Rivers in the <hi>Lower Plains.</hi> Theſe Inequalities render half the Country not eaſily capable of Culture; and impoveriſhes it, where torne up with the Plough, by daily waſhing away the richer Mould that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the Surface.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>South</hi> Mountain is not in Ridges like the <hi>Endleſs</hi> Mountains,
<note place="margin">Third Stage, or Piemont.</note> but in ſmall, broken, ſteep, ſtony Hills; nor does it run with ſo much Regularity. In ſome Places it gradually degenerates to Nothing, not to appear again for ſome Miles, and in others ſpreads ſeveral Miles in Breadth. Between the South Mountain and the hither Chain of the Endleſs Mountains, (often for Diſtinction called the North Mountain,
<note n="‖" place="margin">H k</note> and in ſome Places the Kittatinni,
<note n="§" place="margin">F f</note> and Pequílin,
<note n="†" place="margin">F e</note>) there is a Valley of pretty even, good Land, ſome 8, 10 or 20 Miles wide, and is the moſt conſiderable Quantity of valuable Land that the Engliſh are poſſeſt of; and runs through New-Jerſey, Penſilvania, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riland and Virginia. It has yet obtained no general Name, but may properly enough be called <hi>Piemont,</hi> from its Situation. Beſides Conveniencies always attending good Land, this Valley is every where enriched with Limeſtone.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Endleſs Mountains,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fourth Stage, or the Endleſs Mountains.</note> ſo called from a Tranſlation of the Indian Name, bearing that Signification, come next in Order. They are not confuſedly
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007411_0011_102BAF2A5FEA0758"/>ſcattered, and in lofty Peaks overtopping one another, but ſtretch in long uniform Ridges, ſcarce Half a Mile perpendicular in any Place above the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate Vallies. Their Name is expreſſive of their Extent, though no Doubt, not in a literal Senſe. In ſome Places, as towards the Kaats Kill,
<note n="‖" place="margin">D e</note> and the Head of Ronoak,
<note n="§" place="margin">J k</note> one would be induced to imagine he had found their End, but let him look a little on either Side, and he will find them again ſpread in new Branches, of no leſs Extent than what firſt preſented themſelves. The <hi>further</hi> Chain,
<note place="margin">Allegeny Mountains.</note> or Allegeny Ridge of Mountains,
<note n="‖" place="margin">F h</note> keeps moſtly on a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel with the <hi>Iſinglaſſy</hi> Rief, and terminates in a rough ſtony Piece of Ground at the Head of Ronoak and New River.
<note n="§" place="margin">D c</note> The more Eaſterly Chains, as they run further Southward, trend alſo more and more Weſterly; which is the Reaſon that the <hi>Upland</hi> and <hi>Piemont</hi> Valley are ſo much wider in Virginia than farther Northward. This South Weſterly trending of the Hither Chains brings them to meet the Allegeny Mountain, and in ſeveral Places to interſect it and form new Series of Mountains; as is the Caſe, I believe, of the <hi>Oua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioto.</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">J n</note> Where the ſeveral Chains croſs one another, or ſome ſmall <hi>Spurs</hi>

<note place="margin">A Caution in laying out Roads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſtMoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</note> It may be obſerved, that in laying out Roads amongſt Mountains, 'tis beſt to chuſe the ſtony, and not the rocky Ground; though from the Fewneſs of the apparent Rocks, the latter, to an unexperienced Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, would be more promiſing; becauſe, where a great Deal of looſe Stones lie upon the Edges of Hills, and have not fallen from the impending Rocks, 'tis a ſure Sign, that, on the Removal of them, looſe Earth lies underneath; for the Rains waſhing away ſuch, has been the Cauſe of leaving ſo many Stones bare.</p>
            <p>THERE are ſeveral Chains of the Endleſs Mountains which have not come to my Knowledge, and had they been ſo, might have filled ſeveral Places which lie vacant in the Map. But ſo far as we are acquainted with them, we obſerve that each Chain conſiſts of a particular Kind of Stone, and each dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the reſt; and theſe Differences continue for their whole Extent, as far as I can learn. When I croft them I was not apprehenſive of this, and omitted enumerating their Species. Some of the Chains are ſingle narrow Ridges, as the Kittatinni; ſome ſpread two or three Miles broad on the Top; ſome ſteep on one Side and extending with a long Slope on the other; and the ſteeper they are, the more rocky; but they are every where woody where there is Soil proper and ſufficient to ſupport the Trees. Towards the further Ridges North Eaſtward the Mountains conſiſt of rich Land, and in ſome Places are but as large broad Banks, which take three or four Miles to croſs. In the Way to Ohio by Franks Town, after you are paſt the Allegeny Mountain, the Ground is rough in many Places, and continues ſo to the River. Hereabouts the Lawrel Hill ſprings from the Mountain, and continues, though not large, in a very regular Chain, I believe, to the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007411_0012_102B8749B845A3C0"/>Ouaſioto Mountain. For though the Allegeny Mountain is the moſt Weſterly, on the Weſt Branch of Suſquehanna
<note n="‖" place="margin">F h</note>, it is far from being ſo, back of Virginia.</p>
            <p>EXCEPT the further Ridges, as juſt now mentioned,
<note place="margin">Land amongſt the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</note> there is but little good Land in the Mountains; to be ſure not one tenth Part is capable of Culture, and what ſmall Matter there is, conſiſts of extream rich Soil, in Lawns, on the River Edges, being ſo much rich Mud ſubſided there; and commonly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered above Falls, formerly in drowned Land, and now drained, by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers wearing Channels through the Rocks.</p>
            <p>To the North Weſtward of the Endleſs Mountains is a Country of vaſt Extent,
<note place="margin">Fifth Stage, or the Upper Plains.</note> and in a Manner as high as the Mountains themſelves. To look at the abrupt Termination of it, near the Sea Level, as is the Caſe on the Weſt Side of Hudſon's River, below Albany, it looks as a vaſt high Mountain; for the Kaats Kills
<note n="‖" place="margin">D c</note>, though of more lofty Stature than any other Mountains in theſe Parts of America, are but the Continuation of the Plains on the Top; and the Cliffs of them, in the Front they preſent towards Kinderhook. Theſe <hi>UPPER PLAINS</hi> are of extraordinary rich level Land, and extend from the Mohocks River
<note n="§" place="margin">C d</note>, through the Country of the Confederates. Their Termination Northward is at a little Diſtance from Lake Ontario
<note n="‖" place="margin">C e f g h j</note>; but what it is Weſtward is not known, for thoſe moſt extenſive Plains of Ohio are Part of them; which continue to widen as they extend further Weſtward, even far beyond the Miſſiſippi; and its Boundary Southward is a little Chain of broken Hills, about 10 or 15 Miles South of the Ohio River. 'Tis an odd Phaenomenon to obſerve how near the Tide comes up Hudſon's River
<note n="§" place="margin">D c</note> to the Heads of Delaware and Suſquehanna
<note n="‖" place="margin">D d</note>; when theſe two Rivers are obliged to go ſo far to meet it in their own Channels. The Reaſon is, Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware and Suſquehanna have their Heads in the <hi>Plains,</hi> and Hudſon's River the Tide at the Foot of them.

            <p>THE Country between the <hi>Mohocks</hi> and St. <hi>Laurence</hi> Rivers is entirely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſable by Reaſon of Ridges of Hills,

            <p>THE Country round Lake Champlain is a Mixture of broken, rocky,
<note place="margin">Lake Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</note> moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous Land, with very rich fine Bottoms. I have not been able to learn the Order of the Hills, and how they run in Chains; but one, I am told, which is the Continuation of the vaſt high Mountains on Lake St. Sacrament

THE Map,

Hitherto there have not been any Surveys made of them, except the Road which goes from Shippenſburg round Parnel's Knob and by Ray's Town, over the Allegeny Mountains. For this Reaſon I have particularly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to give theſe Parts, which are done from Computations, another Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance than thoſe among the Settlements, where I had actual Surveys to aſſiſt me; leſt the Reader be deceived by an Appearance of Accuracy, where it was impoſſible to attain it.</p>
            <p>THE Paſs through the Mountains from Penſilvania,
<note place="margin">The Author's Route to Oſwego.</note> by Shamokin to Onon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daga and Oſwego, is from my own Obſervations, and well deſerves Regard; becauſe I had a pretty good Inſtrument for obſerving the Latitude, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely noted all our Courſes, and am well accuſtomed to form a Judgment of travelling Diſtances. Mr. WILLIAM FRANKLIN'S Journal to Ohio has been my principal Help in aſcertaining the Longitude of the Fork of Ohio and Monaungáahela;
<note place="margin">Latitude of Fort du Queſne.</note> but however I muſt not omit mentioning, that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of this Fork is laid down from the Obſervation of Colonel FRY, and is at leaſt ten Miles more Northerly than I would otherwiſe have thought it was.
<note place="margin">Ohio not very crooked.</note> The River from hence downward, is agreed by all who have gone down it, to be in general pretty ſtrait, nor can its Curves be indeed conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able where it is confined in a Manner by a Chain of little Hills, from the laſt mentioned Fork, to ten Miles below the Falls. Mr. JOSEPH DOBSON gave me an Account of the Diſtances from Creek to Creek, as they fall in, and of the Iſlands, Rifts and Falls, all the Way from the Fork to Sioto; and Mr. ALEXANDER MAGINTY and Mr. ALEXANDER LOWRY, gave me the reſt to the Falls, as well as confirmed the others. The River from the Fork upwards, is moſtly from Mr. JOHN DAVISON; but that Part from Canawagy to the Head is entirely by Gueſs, for I have no other Information of it, than that it heads with the Cayúga Branch of Suſquehanna.
<note place="margin">General Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations.</note> The Routs acroſs the Country, as well as the Situation of Indian Villages, trading Places, the Creeks that fall into Lake Erie, and other Affairs relating to Ohio and its Branches, are from a great Number of Informations of Traders and others, and eſpecially of a very intelligent Indian called <hi>The Eagle,</hi> who had a good Notion of Diſtances,
<note place="margin">Detroit.</note> Bearings and delineating. The Situation of <hi>Detroit</hi> is chiefly determined by the Computation of its Diſtance from Fort Niagara by Mr. MAGINTY, and its Bearing and Diſtance from the Mouth of Sanduſky.</p>
            <p>I MUST not omit my Acknowledgment to Mr. WILLIAM WEST,
<note place="margin">Aſſiſtance given the Author.</note> for ſeveral valuable Notes about Potomack, the Forks of Ohio, and Parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent; nor to RICHARD PETERS, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> for the great Chearfulneſs he aſſiſted me with in this Compoſition. As for the Branches of Ohio, which head in the New Virginia
<note n="*" place="bottom">So they call, for Diſtinction-ſake, that Part of Virginia South Eaſt of the Ouaſioto Mountains, and on the Branches of Green Briar, New River, and Holſton River.</note>, I am particularly obliged to Mr. THOMAS WALKER, for the Intelligence of what Names they bear, and what Rivers they fall into Northward and Weſtward; but this Gentleman being on a Journey when I
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007411_0014_102BAF30C081DA30"/>happened to ſee him, had not his Notes, whereby he might otherwiſe have rendered thoſe Parts more perfect. But the Particulars of theſe and many other Articles relating to the Situation of Places, I muſt defer, till I deliver an Account of the ſeveral Rivers and Creeks, their Navigation, Portages and Lands thereon.</p>
            <p>IN Regard to the Boundaries of the Colonies,
<note place="margin">Boundaries of Colonies.</note> I have inſerted thoſe eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Authority, and left the reſt undetermined. But I muſt not omit obſerving,
<note place="margin">Between New-York &amp; New-Jerſey.</note> that though the Line between the upper Part of New-Jerſey and New-York, is not ſettled, the Station Point in Latitude 41 : 40, on the only Branch of Delaware in that Latitude, was ſettled by Commiſſioners and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians, appointed by Acts of Aſſembly of both Provinces, and certified under their Hands and Seals, in 1719. But the Determination of the other End, on Hudſon's River, in Latitude 40, by Reaſon of a Difference of four Minutes in ſome Obſervations made with the Inſtrument, was ſuſpended till a more accurate One could be procured.
<note place="margin">of Penſilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia and Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware.</note> The Southern Boundaries of Penſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, and thoſe of Delaware Colony, are according to a late Decree in Chancery; but how far Penſilvania extends Northward is not yet ſettled, but I am convinced the Patent intended it at Latitude 43, though it calls it the Beginning of the 43d Degree. But the Diſputes about Plantation Bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries I have determined to reſerve for another Place.</p>
            <p>I HAVE not Room here to enlarge on the State of the <hi>INDIANS,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Indian Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</note> nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe their ſeveral Boundaries. But it muſt be obſerved, that they do not generally bound their Countries by Lines, but by conſiderable Extents of Land. For as their Numbers are not conſiderable in Proportion of the Lands they poſſeſs, they fix their Towns commonly on the Edges of great Rivers for the Sake of the rich Lawns to ſow their Corn in. The intermediate Ground they reſerve for their Hunting, which equally ſerves for that Purpoſe and a Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier: For Example;
<note place="margin">The Bounds of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Confederates. towards Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada.</note> The Confederates
<note n="*" place="bottom">Otherwiſe called Iroquois, Five Nations, Six Nations, Minquas and Mingoes.</note> actual Settlements were bounded Northward by the <hi>Cloven</hi> Rock and <hi>Regioghne</hi> Point, on Lake Champlain; the Raarondacks were bounded by the further Side of St. Laurence River; and all the intermediate Ground reſerved for a Frontier between them.</p>
            <p>THE Bounds of the <hi>Confederates</hi> Land on that Side is ſtill the ſame. And as it may be Matter of Enquiry at this Time, I ſhall, as well as I am able, in a little Compaſs, give the ſame on the other Sides, as far as can be learnt with Certainty;
<note place="margin">towards Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany.</note> but ſhall not regard the Purchaſes made by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, but their old Boundaries only on this Side. They formerly included the Branches of Otter Creek and Wood Creek

<note n="‖" place="margin">I f</note>, to the Great Bent of Potomack
<note n="§" place="margin">G g</note>; and as theſe were ſubdued by the Engliſh, the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates claim no Right to that Part of Virginia. The <hi>Monacans</hi> or <hi>Tuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>róras</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">I j</note>, divided alſo into many Tribes, occupied the Branches of James Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from the Falls upwards, and the Country thence Southward.

And tho' the Confederates lay no Claim to theſe Parts in Right of the <hi>Tuſcaroras,</hi> who form one Nation of the Confederacy, becauſe they have been obliged by the Force of Arms to abandon it; they are not ſo well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Regard to the Lands of the <hi>Tuteloes</hi> and <hi>Meherins,</hi> who are other Tribes, and received into their Protection; from whence the Boundary here is not ſo certain.</p>

Though the Engliſh have lately ſettled thereabouts, and the Country had not any Indian Settlers, the Confederates claim a Right there in Virtue of having acquired it by Arms from the former Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Shiwaneſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Shawaneſe conquered.</note> who were formerly one of the moſt conſiderable Nations of theſe Parts of America, whoſe Seat extended from Kentucke
<note n="‖" place="margin">I p</note>, South Weſtward to Miſſiſippi, have been ſubdued by the Confederates, and the Country ſince become their Property.

               <note place="margin">Welinis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered.</note> called by the French <hi>Ilinois,</hi> had their Seat on a fine River, which bears their Name
<note n="§" place="margin">In the Sketch.</note>, and thence North Eaſt by the South End of Lake Ilinois, along Mineami River to Lake Erie. They had many Years War with the Confederates, and were compelled to acknowledge their Superiority, but however without being Subjects. They are now in cloſe Friendſhip; and for the Sake of their having the Advantage of Trade with the Engliſh, the Confederates allotted them the Land on Quiaághtena

<note n="‖" place="margin">G o p q r</note>, which is ſtill the Property of the Confederates; but the Land of the Wellnis, where they were formerly ſeated, ſtill remains their own. As for the Land from the Weſt End of Lake Erie to the South End of Lake Ilinois
<note n="§" place="margin">E o p q r s</note>, which, in the Courſe of the War, the Confederates gained with the Sword, they have allotted Part to the Wiandóts.</p>

Upon this Account all that Peninſula between the Lakes Michigan, Huron and Erie, is become the Property of the Confederates, and the Wian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dóts their Subjects; and to preſerve their Fidelity, and to afford them Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, their preſent Seat was allotted them.
<note place="margin">United with the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.</note> The Delawares and theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into an entire League of Aſſociation in 1751. I think the Wiandóts the ſame as the <hi>Foxes</hi> or <hi>Outagamis.</hi> Their Language diſcovers them of the original Stock of the Erigas and Confederates.</p>
            <p>THE Outagamis and ſome other Nations on the further Side of the Lakes are ſubdued by the Confederates; but I am not enabled to relate the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars with any Certainty, and ſo cannot ſpecify what Lands they have a Right to beyond the Weſtern Side of Lake Michigan. And though they have of ten carried their Arms far beyond the Miſſiſippi, and compelled the Nation ſeated there to retire further Weſtward, I have not been able to learn how far their Dominion extends on that Side, though they ſay it is conſiderably.</p>

               <note place="margin">Skaniadaráde conquered.</note> which lies on the North Side of Lake Erie, has long been ſubjected to the ſuperior Arms of the Confederates; its antient Inhabitants, called by the French, <hi>Hurons,</hi> from the beaſtly Shapes of their Heads, and nearly related to the Raaróndacks, who do not trim their Hair in the ſprightly Form of the other Savages, as almoſt extinct. But the Country all along the South Side of the Outawa River, for a conſiderable Extent, belongs to thoſe Remains of Algonkins, the

<note place="margin">Algonkins not ſubdued.</note> Nipiſſings, &amp;c. who by the Aſſiſtance of the French have eſcaped the Fate of moſt other Nations, who have had Occaſion to contend with the Confederates.</p>

<note place="margin">French Rights from F.

<note place="margin">Other Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the Confederates.</note> eſpecially on the South Side, as far as Tadouſac, but as in Treaties of Peace, the Bounds of Countries are not often inſiſted upon by the Americans, they are entirely at a Loſs, what their Rights are in thoſe Parts.</p>
            <p>I HAVE not Room to enlarge on theſe Articles, nor to give the Authorities whereon they are founded; nor likewiſe to enumerate the ſeveral Tribes of Nations who occupy the Country included in this Map. But however, I muſt not omit mentioning,
<note place="margin">Vulgar Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots.</note> that the Number of Nations is far leſs than is commonly imagined. The Notions that every little Society is a ſeparate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that the Chief of a Village is a King, or that there is any ſuch Thing as coercive Power amongſt the American Natives of theſe Parts, ſo generally maintained by the Engliſh, are without the leaſt Foundation.

               <note place="margin">The preſent Indians on Suſquehanna.</note> after a great Defeat by the Marilanders, were eaſily exterminated by the Confederates. So, thoſe Nations who are now on Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quehanna, are only ſuch as the Confederates have allotted that River for; as the <hi>Nanticokes,</hi> from the Eaſtern Shore of Marilanda <hi>Tuteloes</hi> from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herin River in Virginia, and the <hi>Delawares,</hi> under which we include the <hi>Minneſinks,</hi> and the <hi>Mandes,</hi> or Salem Indians.</p>

This Inſult of the French on Britiſh Rights, and other Captures made of our Allies and Traders in thoſe Parts, which ſoon followed, and no Meaſures taken to repel them, gave the French a reaſonable Pretenſion for eſtabliſhing themſelves in Junundat
<note n="§" place="margin">I n</note>, Preſquiſle
<note n="‖" place="margin">Ej</note>, Mad Creek
<note n="†" place="margin">G q</note>, Winingo
<note n="¶" place="margin">Ej</note>, and Fort du Queſne
<note n="*" place="margin">F j</note>, as Places not worth our Regard or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. But it is to be hoped, that notwithſtanding the Induſtry ſo lately uſed, not by the French alone, for the Eſtabliſhment of the French Power in America, his Majeſty of Great-Britain is no longer to be kept unacquainted with the Conſequence of the Country between the Britiſh Settlements and Miſſiſippi; which muſt one Day determine, whether the Southern Colonies ſhall remain the Property of the Britiſh Crown; or the Inhabitants, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the entire Defection of their Slaves, which the French will encourage, as the Spaniards now do at St. Auguſtine, be obliged to fall under the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of France. Let not the Public think this a remote Contingence: If the French ſettle back of us, the Engliſh muſt either ſubmit to them, or have their Throats cut, and loſe all their Slaves. As bad as French Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Religion is to thoſe who have any Remains of Britiſh Spirit, it is eaſy to gueſs what Alternative the moſt zealous of us would chuſe.</p>
            <p>I MUST not omit giving one Caution to thoſe in Power,
<note place="margin">A Caution to ſecure the Country back of Carolina in Time.</note> in this public Manner, for I find from Experience, that few are to be benefited by private Information. Hitherto we have apprehended no greater Scheme of the French than making a Chain of Communication between Canada and the Mouth of Miſſiſippi. As this was remote, we thought ourſelves but little intereſted in it. Now they attempt it nigher to us, by the Way of Ohio, where they have begun an Eſtabliſhment; if this ſucceed, it is not Ohio only muſt fall under their Dominion, but the Country thence Southward to the Bay of Mexico. For that Reaſon, it becomes the Engliſh immediately to eſtabliſh Forts on the Cherokee River, and other Paſſes in the Way from Ohio to Moville, before the French attempt to ſettle there, or draw off the Cherokees, Chicaſaws or Creeks from their Friendſhip to the Engliſh. And ſuppoſing the French ſhould be beaten off from the Ohio, 'tis ten to one but they will turn their Forces, in Hopes of better Fortune, to the Back of Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina. We charge the Indians with Fickleneſs,
<note place="margin">Miſtakes in Indian Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</note> but with greater Propriety we ſhould charge ourſelves with great Want of Senſe or Experience, in ſuppoſing any Nation is to be tied to another, by any Thing than Intereſt. The We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linis cultivated a Friendſhip with the Engliſh for the Sake of Trade, and got Leave of the Confederates to remove nigher them. They ſhewed both Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Reſolution in the Defence of the Engliſh at the Tawìghtawi Town
<note n="§" place="margin">G p</note>, where they loſt out of 70, not leſs than 22 Warriors on the Spot: And though the French afterwards offered them very advantageous Terms, they ſtill perſiſted in their Affection to us; and in their War with the French,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007411_0019_102D81F39E1A2188"/>amuſed with Expectation of Relief, they were baſely abandoned, without Arms and without Ammunition, to the Reſentment of an enraged Enemy. 'Tis a Cuſtom, eſtabliſhed with the Engliſh, to purchaſe the Friendſhip of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Nations at a great Expence, and to abandon their Friends. Hence thoſe who know this Mixture of Weakneſs and Baſeneſs that poſſeſſes us, keep Members of Council in the French Intereſt as well as ours, as the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates do, to keep us under a perpetual Contribution; while thoſe Nations who are truly in our Intereſt are entirely ſlighted.</p>
            <p>IF we ſecure the Country back of Carolina in Time, we ſhall yet defeat the very Point that it is the French Intereſt to purſue, I mean a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Ohio and Moville. Whatever we may ſurmiſe in Regard to the great River Miſſiſippi being the only Channel fitted for the inland Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of Florida,
<note place="margin">'The bad Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation of Miſſiſippi.</note> and no other would ſuit the French, we ſhall find ourſelves extremely miſtaken. Even now the French ſcarce ever come up that River by Water, by Reaſon of its great and uniform Rapidity, ſcarce to be ſtemm'd in a Canoe and ſix Oars in Mid-channel. This obliges the French, in coming up, to take to the River Rouge, notwithſtanding they are obliged to make one or two very long Portages. The Edges are leſs rapid in the Miſſiſippi, but them the Enmity of the Indians on its Banks prevents their keeping ſo near the Shore. Therefore, to make what Uſe this River is capable of, the French muſt ſecure the Country of the Chicaſaws and Cherokees; and then Moville, and not New Orleans, will be the Center of the French Trade of Florida; ſince the latter, though ſcarce forty Leagues up the Miſſiſippi, by Reaſon of the Rapidity of the River, is not reached with Ships in leſs than thirty or forty Days from the Mouth; and Moville is upon Tide Water. If, in Purſuit of our preſent Point on Ohio, we ſhew any Remiſneſs in our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the Safety of thoſe Indians, who are our Friends, or we neglect to ſecure the Country back of Carolina, the Defection of the Indians there is inevitable; ſince the French have long known the Conſequence of it, though much to their Coſt. The Public may be amuſed with a Notion that we have Forts and Settlements there already, as repreſented in ſome Maps, publiſhed with great Authority—I can only ſay, That I wiſh either were true. Itinerant Trading is not a <hi>Settlement,</hi> in the Senſe the Engliſh uſe the Word; nor a Houſe built of Logs of Wood, without Order or Artillery, or Garriſon, a <hi>Fort</hi> in any Senſe.</p>

               <p>THE Face of the Country,
<note place="margin">All the Rivers and Creeks navigable in the Lower Plains.</note> as already repreſented, determines the Nature of the Rivers. The Flat Country (or <hi>Lower Plains</hi>) which lies between the Falls and the Sea, is every where interwoven with the moſt beautiful Bays, Rivers and Creeks, navigable for all Sorts of Veſſels; and is the Reaſon of ſo many fine Creeks ſpreading on every Side, from the Bays of Cheſopeak and Delaware. For, as the Land has no Declivity, the Flux and Reflux of the Sea contributes to ſo wide extended Navigation. All the Creeks on Delaware, the Verges of the Sounds, which extend along the Sea-coaſt, and ſome
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007411_0020_102D81F70CC33A28"/>Creeks in Virginia,
<note place="margin">Salt Marſhes.</note> and towards the Head of Cheſopeak on the Weſt Side, are bordered with Salt Marſhes, ſome a Mile or two wide. The firſt Settlers of America, for the Sake of the Graſs for the Winter Support of their Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, fixing their Habitations along theſe Places, were infeſted with Muſkitoes and Intermitting Fevers, gave the Foundation for ſuppoſing America un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy. The reſt of Cheſopeak Bay, and its Branches, is almoſt all a clean, gravelly, ſteep, dry Bank; and, were it not for the Scarcity of Freſh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in ſome Parts of the Eaſtern Shore, would be as pleaſant a Country as Imagination could well repreſent.</p>
               <p>THE Iſinglaſs Vein already deſcribed, though broken at New-York, to let the Tide through into Hudſon's River, to a far greater Diſtance than any other River on this Coaſt, continues ſtill North Eaſtward, but with leſs Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, over the Weſt End of Long-Iſland and the Connecticut Shore, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing but here and there, by Reaſon of its being overlaid with the Ridges which terminate here.</p>
               <p>THAT Part of New-England laid down in this Map, as well as thoſe Parts of New Jerſey,
<note place="margin">The Upland has great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity, and the Rivers ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid.</note> Penſilvania, Mariland and Virginia, between the Iſinglaſs Vein and the North Mountain, ſlopes toward the Sea with a great Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and by that Means the Rivers and Rivulets have great Rapidity, and are excellently fitted for all Sorts of Mills; a great Advantage to Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies like ours,

In the Endleſs Mountains, the Rivers are generally ſtony and rapid; and in ſome Places, where interrupted with Riefs of Rocks, not yet worn to the Level, they fall in great Cataracts; and above ſuch Places are generally dead and ſlow, or ſpread in Ponds, to drown the ſurrounding Land.</p>
               <p>IN the elevated Flats,
<note place="margin">In the Upper Plains, the Rivers gentle, and well fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Inland Navigation.</note> which form the Country of the Confederates and Ohio, the Rivers are generally eaſy in their Currents; and as that Country is of vaſt Extent, they are large and excellently accommodated for Inland Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation. This may ſuffice in general, but it is worth while to ſpecify ſome of the moſt conſiderable Rivers contained in this Map.</p>

<note place="margin">To Montreal.</note> which is half Way; the Paſſage is commonly five or ſix Days with a fair Wind, by Reaſon of ſunken Rocks in the Tide Way, and the Shallowneſs of Lake St. Pierre, compelling them to lie by a Nights; and the Rapidity of the Current thence to Montreal. From this to the Anſe of la Galette

                     </gap> c</note>, is very gentle and eaſily paſſed with Boats or Canoes. Though it bears the Name of St. Laurence no further, I ſhall proceed with the Water that ſupplies it.</p>
               <p>ONTARIO or Cataraqui is a beautiful Lake of freſh Water,
<note place="margin">Lake Ontario.</note> very deep, and has a moderate ſteep Bank and gravelly Shore along the South Side:
<note n="§" place="margin">C f g h j</note> The Rivers which fall into it are apt to be ſometimes barred at the Entrances. This,
<note place="margin">Its Tides.</note> like the Mediterrancan, the Caſpian and other large invaſated Waters,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007411_0021_102D81F8F3E2AF30"/>has a ſmall Riſing and Falling of the Water like Tides, ſome 12 or 18 Inches perpendicular, occaſioned by the Changes in the State of the Atmoſphere; riſing higher, as the Weight of the incumbent Air is leſs, and falling, as it becomes greater. This Lake is beſt fitted for the Paſſage of Batteaux and Canoes, along the South Side, the other having ſeveral Rocks near the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Water; but the Middle is every where ſafe for Shipping. The Snow is deeper on the South Side of this Lake, than any other Place in theſe Parts; but the Lake does not freeze, in the ſevereſt Winter, out of Sight of Land.
<note place="margin">The Streight of Niágara.</note> The Streight of <hi>Oghniágara</hi>
                  <note n="§" place="margin">C D j</note>, between the Lake Ontario and Erie, is eaſily paſſable ſome five or ſix Miles with any Ships, or ten Miles in all with Canoes;
<note place="margin">Portage.</note> then you are obliged to make a Portage up three pretty ſharp Hills about eight Miles, where there is now cut a pretty good Cart-way. This Portage is made to avoid that ſtupendous Fall of Oghniágara,
<note place="margin">Falls.</note> which in one Place precipitates headlong five or ſix and twenty Fathoms, and continues for ſix or ſeven Miles more to tumble in little Falls, and run with inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Rapidity. And indeed the Streight for a Mile or two is ſo rapid, above the Fall, that it is not ſafe venturing near it. They embark again at the Fiſhing Battery, and thence to Lake Erie it is eighteen Miles, and the Stream ſo ſwift, that the ſtiffeſt Gale is ſcarce ſufficient to ſtem it in a Ship; but it is eaſily paſſed in Canoes, where the Current here, as in all other Places, is leſs rapid along the Shore.</p>
               <p>LAKE <hi>Erie</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">DEjklmno</note> has a fine ſandy Shore on the North Side;
<note place="margin">Lake Erie.</note> and in many Places ſuch, on the other, eſpecially towards the South Eaſt Part. The Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Climate of this is far more moderate than that of Ontario.</p>
               <p>THE Streight St. Clair,

                  <note n="¶" place="margin">E k</note>, fine Rivers, navigable a good Way with Shallops, fall into the South Side of Lake Erie. Though the Bank on this Side is about eight or ten Feet high,
<note place="margin">Rivers on the South Side of Lake Erie.</note> and dry enough in moſt Places, the Land, a little Way back, is generally wet and ſwampy, by Reaſon of theſe Rivers wanting ſufficient Deſcent, or better Channels made to drain it.</p>
               <p>THE great and little <hi>Sèneca</hi> Rivers
<note n="§" place="margin">C e C g</note> are the moſt conſiderable Waters that fall into the South Side of Lake Ontario,
<note place="margin">On the South of Lake On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tario.</note> but neither navigable with Shallops, ſave about Half a Mile in the former, and two or three Miles in the latter. Their Falls, over the Edge of the elevated Plains, are the Cauſes of theſe Obſtructions. But after you are gone up the Little Seneca River above the three Falls, and the great Seneca River, about Half a Mile above the Mouth of Onondaga River, they are both very ſlow and deep. The latter is beſt laid down in the Map, for I have had an Opportunity of viewing it myſelf
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007411_0022_102D81FB16A378A0"/>from Onondaga downwards, and thence upwards I have been favoured with the Obſervations of Mr. BLEECHER.</p>
               <p>THE River <hi>Sorêl,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sorel River.</note> falls into St. Lawrence, at the upper End of Lake St. Pierre, and drains the Lake Champlain. The Stream is pretty moderate from the Mouth to the Baſon at Chamle; from thence to St. Jean are three Falls, impaſſable for any Craft, and for that Reaſon they make a Portage of ſix Miles.
<note place="margin">The Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Canada and Albany.</note> But this is little frequented. The Communication between the French and Engliſh Colonies is extreamly difficult by any Way than this to Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's River; which makes Lake Champlain and its Branches one of the moſt important Waters in North-America; inſomuch, that whether the French or Engliſh remain Maſters of it, the Colonies of the other muſt lie at their Mercy.</p>
               <p>THE Route from Montreal
<note n="§" place="margin">A c</note> to Albany
<note n="‖" place="margin">D c</note> is begun by ferrying over to <hi>la Praire</hi>
                  <note n="§" place="margin">A c</note>, and thence a Land Carriage, over low wet Ground, fifteen Miles to <hi>St. Jean.</hi> From this Poſt, which is truly but a Magazine, they go in a Schooner to Grown Point,
<note place="margin">Crown Point.</note> a very conſiderable Fortreſs, at the Head of Lake Champlain, and the Mouth of Wood Creek. Two Ways lead from hence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Hudſon's River;
<note place="margin">Paſſage by Lake St. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> the one by Lake St. Sacrament, in which there is a Mile Portage, in the Streight between the Lake and Wood Creek. 'Tis very dangerous paſſing this Lake at the Change of Weather, by Reaſon of the great Waves ariſing without much Wind, and the inacceſſible Cliffs of vaſt high Mountains on the Eaſt Side. At the Head, the Lake divides into two Bays, from the Eaſtermoſt of which is a Portage twelve Miles, or more, to Hudſon's River
<note n="‖" place="margin">C c</note>. And from this Portage to Albany, you go down Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's River, without any other Interruption than two little Portages
<note n="§" place="margin">C c</note> of about Half a Mile each. The other Way from Crown Point towards Hudſon's River,
<note place="margin">By Wood Creek.</note> is altogether by Wood Creek, and you are only interrupted with a Portage
<note n="‖" place="margin">C b</note> of a Stone's Throw or two in Length, at a Place, called Kingia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaghtenec. The Portage from Wood Creek to Hudſon's River
<note n="§" place="margin">C c</note> is twelve Miles alſo; and the Paſſage thence to Albany is by the ſame River, and with the ſame. Interruption. The whole performed in five or ſix Days.</p>
               <p>I HAVE not Room to enlarge on all the Rivers that fall into the Ocean in the Britiſh Colonies; nor do I think it neceſſary, ſince many are ſo well known; but for particular Reaſons it is worth deſcribing ſome Half a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of the moſt conſiderable.</p>
               <p>CONNECTICUT River

<note n="§" place="margin">C b</note>, after falling with great Rapidity, the River ſhoots between two Rocks, ſcarce thirty Feet aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Between Miller's River and Deerfield are two Falls, the lowermoſt impaſſable. Between Mount Tom and the Hollyhocks is a very bad Rift; and five or ſix Miles lower are the Hampton and Fiſhing Falls, both paſſable. The Gulf Bar is a paſſable Rift, juſt above Enfield Meeting-houſe. Theſe are all the Falls that have come to my Knowledge; the River elſewhere is
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007411_0023_102D81FCB4E628F8"/>moderately ſwift, and may be improved to a fine Inland Navigation. For though I have extended it no higher than No. 4, It continues a very fine Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in much the ſame Direction;

This Creek takes the general Courſe laid down in the Map. But as Mr. EDWARD SCULL, to whom I am obliged for many Obſervations in the Courſe of my Map has lately laid out ſome great Tracts of Land on this Creek, and given me an Account of it, ſince the Engraving of that Part, I ſhall here deliver a few Particulars, to avert ſome public Diſputes that have been about it. From the Mouth to the Fork the Courſe is S. 70° W about
<note place="margin">Its Fork.</note> twelve Miles in a ſtrait Line, the Creek crooked and rapid. There the two Branches are nearly of a Bigneſs, the Southern one rather the largeſt. Half a Mile above the Fork, the South Branch, or Wallanpaupack,
<note place="margin">The Southern Branch.</note> rumbles about thirty Feet perpendicularly; and a little Way higher are two other Falls, not quite ſo large. From the Fork to the Proprietaries Tract,
<note place="margin">Three great Falls.</note> it is S. 60 W. four or five Miles, the Channel pretty ſtrait. Thence for ten Miles taken in a ſtrait Line, the Courſe is S. 56 W. by Compaſs, the Stream crooked and very gentle. By the Range of the Hills, this Branch continues much the ſame Direction to its Source. The Northern Branch of Legheiwacſein,
<note place="margin">The North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Branch forks again.</note> divides again into two Branches, at about a Mile and a Quarter above the Mouth, where each is about large enough to turn an under-ſhot Griſt Mill. Three Quarters of a Mile higher is a great Pine Swamp, through which both Branches come. Mr. SCULL thinks that theſe Branches, whoſe general Courſe is about N. W. do not at moſt extend above 15 Miles; and that all the Waters this Way are confined to the lower Side of the great Chains of Mountains, which extend from about the Station Point to Suſquehanna about Whiôming.</p>

Delaware has no other Branches on the Weſt Side between the Station Point and Eaſton, worth the mentioning; the Country being drained by little Runs and Creeks.</p>

<note n="§" place="margin">G g</note>, which however is paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The River runs through the North Mountain without any Fall; and from thence to Wills's Creek
<note n="‖" place="margin">G h</note>, there are three or four Rifts paſſable with Canoes or Batteaux, when the Water is not very low. The Inland Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by this River is ſcarce begun; but one may foreſee that it will become in Time the moſt important in America, as it is likely to be the ſole Paſſage from Ohio to the Ocean. The North Branch is ſcarce paſſable with Canoes beyond the Shawane Fields, ſome three or four Miles above Wills's Creek. The Portage from this Branch to Ohio is yet unſettled,
<note place="margin">Portage from Wills's Creek to Youghio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gani.</note> by Reaſon of the bad Roads and Hills. But as at this Time it may be an Object of Enquiry, ſome Account of the Ground will not be unacceptable. From Wills's Creek the Ground is very ſtony for the greater Part of the Way to the Allegeny Mountain
<note n="§" place="margin">G h</note>; but not ſo much ſo from the Shawane Fields. The Mountain, though pretty ſtony, may have a good Waggon Road made over it. On the North Weſt Side of this Chain of Hills, there is all along a great Deal of Swampy Ground, which is a conſiderable Obſtruction to a direct Paſſage; but yet manageable by taking ſome little Compaſs round. From this Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you croſs two Branches of Youghiogani; the greater, which is the moſt Weſterly, at three Miles above the Joining of the three Forks, or Turkey Foot
<note n="‖" place="margin">G j Ohiopyle Falls.</note> And the three Forks are three Miles above the Lawrel Hill, thro' which Youghiogani precipitates by a great Fall of near thirty Feet, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to run with great Rapidity for two or three Miles further. At this Time to go from the great Croſſing to Youghiogani below the Falls, they are obliged to go by the Meadows, there croſs Lawrel Hill, and return again Northward, and by that Means take near thirty Miles to reach the navigable Water of this River: Whereas if a Road could be made near the Fall, 15 or 20 Miles might be ſaved in the Way to Fort du Queſne. There is a good Ford through Youghiogani, and the Ground all the Way good and ſound; and a Road eaſily made along it. Lawrel Hill, though ſmall,
<note place="margin">Lawrel Hill G j</note> is a Ridge very hard to croſs, by Reaſon of its Steepneſs; but at the Meadows is the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007411_0027_102D71B56F665A88"/>beſt Paſs we know of yet towards Virginia; there a Waggon, which would require four Horſes to travel with, may be drawn up by Six. Probably a Paſs may alſo be found for Wheel Carriages to the North of the Falls; and if there ſhould, it would much improve the Portage between Potomack and Youghiogani, and reduce it to fifty Miles, whereas it is now but little ſhort of Seventy. If we have the good Fortune of being Maſters of Ohio the Navigation of Youghiogani will be of Importance,
<note place="margin">Youghiogani navigable to the Falls.</note> ſince it is paſſable with flat-bottomed Boats, capable of carrying four or five Tons, from the Mouth to the Foot of the Rift below the Falls. A Horſe Path may be conducted in ſix or ſeven Miles without much Expence from the great Croſſing to the Head of navigable Water. From this to Fort du Queſne you may go down in a Day, but it requires at leaſt Three to return up the Stream.</p>

                  <note place="margin">South Branch of Potomack.</note> the KING'S and Lord FAIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FAX'S Commiſſioners determined the <hi>North</hi> to be the main Branch; yet it is very well known, that the <hi>South</hi> Branch is navigable forty Miles up, with Batteaux. And as it was not clear to me that the true Head of Potomack was at the Place thoſe Gentlemen determined it, I have not laid down the Weſtern Side of Mariland, which ſhould be a Meridian drawn from the Head of Potomack to the Penſilvania Line. If the Affair is candidly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, it will probably be determined, that the South Branch is the moſt conſiderable. If ſo, the Head of the North Branch will not be the Weſtern Extremity of Mariland, though it now is of Lord FAIRFAX'S Grant. No Search has been yet made, if there is any Portage by a good Road from the South Branch to Monaungáhela

<note place="margin">Navigation to Chartier's. Fj</note> the Navigation of this River may be divided into four Parts. 1. From Canawagy to Chartier's Old Town, in Battoes, capable of carrying about three or four Tons, and drawing twelve Inches Water. 2. From Chartier's to the Big Bent, in Flats, like thoſe uſed in Delaware
<note place="margin">To the Big Bent. H m</note>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Page 21.</note>, or larger; bearing eighteen or twenty Tons. Theſe two Parts muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in long flat-bottomed Boats, as better fitted for ſetting in ſhallow Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and rapid Streams. 3. From the Big Bent to the Falls, in Shallops or Schooners, of ten or fifteen Tons. As theſe are made for ſailing and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Windward, they muſt have ſharp Bottoms, and deep Keels; and though made broader than the Flats, they will not admit ſuch great Lengths, and therefore not capable of ſo large Burdens. 4. From the Falls to Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippi, in good Sloops or large Schooners. The Navigation of Miſſiſippi thence to the Sea is only fitted for light Canoes or Battoes againſt the Stream; but for any Veſſels downwards, when the Floods are not ſo high, as to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow the adjoining wide extended Flats. Hence, in Proceſs of Time, large Ships may be built upon Ohio, and ſent off to Sea with the heavy Produce of the Country, and ſold with the Cargoes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>OHIO</hi> has a great many <hi>Branches,</hi> which furniſh good Navigation to the adjacent Parts; the moſt remarkable I intend to enumerate.</p>
               <p>CANAWAGY
<note n="‖" place="margin">Canawagy. E j Portage to Lake Erie.</note>, when raiſed with Freſhes, is paſſable with Bark Canoes, or light Battoes, to a little Lake at its Head; from which there is a Portage of twenty Miles to Lake Erie, at the Mouth of a little Creek called Jadáphque. This Portage is but little frequented, becauſe Canawagy is too ſhallow in Summer, for the lighteſt Craft.</p>
               <p>BUGHALOONS
<note n="§" place="margin">Bughaloons E j</note> is not navigable; and noted only for large Meadows, as the Word ſignifies in the Delaware Indian Language.</p>
               <p>TORANADAGHKOA, French Creek, or Riviere le Bieuf
<note n="‖" place="margin">Riviere le Bieuf. E j</note>, is noted for its furniſhing the neareſt Paſſage to Lake Erie. It is navigable with Canoes to the French Fort, by a very crooked Channel; the Portage thence to another Fort on Lake Erie, called <hi>Preſqu' Iſle,</hi> from an adjoining Peninſula,
<note place="margin">Portage to Lake Erie. Licking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Creek, &amp;c. Ej</note> is fifteen Miles; this Way the French come from Canada to Ohio. <hi>Licking Creek</hi> and <hi>Lacomick</hi> have no Navigation; but the former has Plenty of Coals.</p>
               <p>TOBY'S Creek, is paſſable with Bark Canoes a good Way up,
<note place="margin">Toby's Creek E j</note> towards the Weſt Branch of Suſquehanna; and a pretty ſhort Portage may probably be found between them.</p>
               <p>MOGHULBUGHKITUM is paſſable alſo a good Way towards the ſame Branch,
<note place="margin">Moghulbugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kitúm. F j</note> and will probably furniſh a good Portage alſo.</p>
               <p>KISHKEMINETAS is paſſable with Canoes forty or fifty Miles;
<note place="margin">Kiſhkemìne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas. F j</note> and good Portages will probably be found between it and Juniata and Potomack. It has Coal and Salt.</p>
               <p>MONAUNGAHELA is a very large Branch,
<note place="margin">Monäungá<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hela. F j</note> at whoſe Junction with Ohio ſtands Fort du Queſne. It is deep and gentle, and paſſable with large Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes beyond Redſtone Creek, and ſtill farther with lighter Craft. At ſix Miles from the Mouth it divides into two Branches;
<note place="margin">Youghigani. F j</note> the Northermoſt Youghio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gani, paſſable with good Battoes to the Foot of the Rift at Lawrel Hill. The Portage from this to Potomack has been already mentioned

                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:007411_0031_102D820C6465C3A8"/>
THE <hi>Soil</hi> along theſe Parts of Ohio and its Eaſtern Branches,
<note place="margin">Sorts of Land on Ohio a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Fort du Queſne.</note> though but little broken with high Mountains, is none of the beſt; conſiſting in general of low dry Ridges of White-Oak and Cheſtnut Land, with very rich inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val low Meadow Ground. Here and there are Spots of fine White-Pines, and in many Places great Extents of poor Pitch Pines. The Land from the Back-part of the Endleſs Mountains, Weſtward to Ohio, and from Fort du Queſne upward, is of theſe Sorts. The ſame little broken Chain of Hills, which borders it here, near the River Side, continues South Weſterly, till it ends at ten Miles below the Falls; keeping at ſome ten or fifteen Miles from the general Courſe of the River all the Way down.</p>
               <p>BEAVER CREEK
<note n="§" place="margin">Beaver Creek. F k</note> is navigable with Canoes only. At Kiſhkuſkes, about 16 Miles up, two Branches ſpread oppoſite Ways; one interlocks with French Creek and Cherâge; the other weſtward with Muſkíngum and Cayahóga; on this are many Salt Springs, about Thirty-five Miles above the Forks; it is canoable about twenty Miles farther. The Eaſtern Branch is leſs conſiderable; and both are very ſlow, ſpreading through a very rich level Country, full of Swamps and Ponds; which prevent a good Portage, that might otherwiſe be made to Cayahóga; but will, no doubt, in future Ages, be fit to open a Canal between the Waters of Ohio and Lake Erie.</p>
               <p>MUSKINGUM
<note n="§" place="margin">Muſkíngum G l</note> is a fine, gentle River, confined within high Banks, that orevent its Floods from damaging the ſurrounding Land. It is paſſable with large Battoes to the Three Legs, and with ſmall Ones to a little Lake at its Head, without any Obſtruction from Falls or Rifts. From hence to Cayahóga is a Portage
<note n="§" place="margin">Portage to Cayahóga. F l Cayahóga. E m Its Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Muſkingum.</note> a Mile long. <hi>Cayahóga,</hi> the Creek, that leads from this Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to Lake Erie is muddy and middling ſwift, but no where obſtructed with Falls or Rifts. As this has fine Land, wide extended Meadows, lofty Timber; Oak and Mulberry fitted for Ship-building, Walp Cheſtnut and Poplar for domeſtic Services, and furniſhes the ſhorteſt and beſt Portage between the Ohio and Lake Erie; and its Mouth is ſufficient to receive good Sloops from the Lake; it will in Time become a Place of Conſequence <hi>Muſkingum,</hi> though ſo wide extended in its Branches, ſpreads all in moſt excellent Land, abounding in good Springs, and Conveniencies, particularly adapted for Settlements re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from mature Navigation, as Coal, Clay and Freeſtone. In 1748 a Coal Mine, oppoſite Lamenſhìkola Mouth, took Fire, and kept burning above a Twelve-month, where great Quantities are ſtill left. Near the ſame Place is excellent Whetſtone; and about eight Miles, higher up the River, is Plenty of White and blue Clay for Glaſs Works and Pottery. Though the Quantity of good Land on Ohio, and its Branches, is vaſtly great, and the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies attending it ſo likewiſe; we may eſteem that on Muſkingum the Flower of it all.</p>
               <p>HOCKHOCKING
<note n="§" place="margin">Hockhóck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. G m</note> is paſſable with Battoes ſeventy or eighty Miles up; it has ſine rich Land, and vaſt graſſy Meadows, high Banks, and ſeldom overſlows. It has Coals about fifteen Miles up, and ſome Knowls of Freeſtone.</p>
               <p>BIG CANHAWA falls into Ohio on the South Eaſt Side,
<note place="margin">Big Canha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wa. H m</note> and is ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a Branch, that it may, by Perſons coming up Ohio on that Side, be miſtaken for the main River. It is ſlow for ten Miles to the little broken
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:007411_0032_102D820E25CA0E98"/>Hills, and the Land very rich; as it is for about the ſame Breadth along Ohio, all the Way from the Pipe Hills to the Falls. After ten Miles up Canhawa, the Land is hilly, the Water pretty rapid, for fifty or ſixty Miles further to the Falls, to which Boats may go. This is a very remarkable Fall,
<note place="margin">Its Falls, H m</note> not for its great Height, but for coming through a Mountain now thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſable for Man or Beaſt, and is itſelf impaſſable. But no doubt Foot or Horſe Paths will be found, when a greater Number of People make the Search, and under leſs Inconveniencies than our Travellers at preſent. By Reaſon of the Difficulty of paſſing the Ouafioto Mountains, I thought them a very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Boundary between Virginia and Ohio in theſe Parts; and for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon made them the Bounds of the Colours (in the coloured Maps) not, that there is any Difference of Right between one Side and the other. <hi>Louiſa,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Its Branches.</note> 
                  <hi>New River,</hi> and <hi>Green Briar,</hi> are fine large Branches of Canhawa; which in future Times will be of Service for the Inland Navigation of New Virginia, as they interlock with Monaungáhela, Potomack, James River, Ronoak and the Cuttawa River.</p>
               <p>TOTTEROY
<note n="§" place="margin">Totteroy. H n</note> falls into Ohio on the ſame Side, and is paſſable with Boats to the Mountains. It is long, and has not many Branches, interlocks with Red Creek, or Clinch's River
<note n="§" place="margin">J n</note> (a Branch of Cuttawa). It has below the Mountains, eſpecially for fifteen Miles from the Mouth, very good Land. And here is a viſible Effect of the Difference of Climate from the upper Parts of Ohio. Here the large Reed, or Carolina Cane, grows in Plenty, even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Upland, and the Severity of the Winter does not kill them; ſo that Travellers this Way are not obliged to provide any Winter Support for their Horſes. And the ſame holds all the Way down Ohio, eſpecially on the South Eaſt Side to the Falls
<note n="‖" place="margin">J r</note>, and thence on both Sides.</p>
               <p>GREAT SALT LICK CREEK
<note n="§" place="margin">Great Salt Lick Creek. H p</note> is remarkable for fine Land, Plenty of Buffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes, Salt Springs, White Clay and Limeſtone. Canoes may come up to the Croſſing of the War Path, or ſomething higher, without a Fall. The Salt Springs hurt its Water for Drinking, but the Number of freſh Springs near it make ſufficient Amends.</p>
               <p>KENTUCKE
<note n="‖" place="margin">Kentúcke. J p</note> is larger than the foregoing, has high Clay Banks, abounds in Cane and Buſſaloes, and has alſo ſome very large Salt Springs. It has no Limeſtone yet diſcovered, but ſome other fit for building. Its Navigation is interrupted with ſome Shoals, but paſſable with Canoes to the Gap, where the War Path goes through the Ouaſioto Mountain. This Gap
<note n="§" place="margin">An import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Paſs thro' Ouaſioto Mountain. J o</note> I point out in the Map, as a very important Paſs; and it is truly ſo, by Reaſon of its being the only Way paſſable with Horſes from Ohio Southward for 3 or 400 Miles Extent. And if the Government has a Mind to preſerve the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try back of Carolina, it ſhould be looked to in Time.</p>
               <p>As we go farther down Ohio, the Diſtance from the Ouaſioto Mountains to the River becomes more conſiderable. The Land, from the little broken Hills to the Mountains, is of a middling Kind, and conſiſts of different Veins and Stratas; and though every where as good as any Part of the Engliſh Settlements, falls far ſhort of that on the other Side of Ohio, or between the little Hills and the River. Theſe Hills
<note n="‖" place="margin">The little Hills South of Ohio. J q to F j</note> are ſmall, and ſeem only the Brink of a riſing Stage of Land, and dividing the rich Plains of Ohio from
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:007411_0033_102D82106684E2B8"/>the Upland, bordering on the Ouaſioto Mountains. They terminate at ten Miles below the Falls; indeed a little Spur extended from their Side is that Limeſtone Rief that Ohio ripples over at the Falls.</p>
               <p>Now to return to the other Side of Ohio.
<note place="margin">Sioto. H o</note> 
                  <hi>Sióto</hi> is a large gentle River, bordered with rich Flats, which it overflows in the Spring; ſpreading then above Half a Mile in Breadth, though when conſined to its Banks it is ſcarce a Furlong wide. If it floods early, it ſcarce retires within its Banks in a Month, or is fordable in a Month or two more. The Land is ſo level, that in the Freſhes of Ohio the Back-water runs eight Miles up. Oppoſite the Mouth of this River is the Lower Shawane Town
<note n="§" place="margin">Lower Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wane Town. H o</note>, removed from the other Side, it was one of the moſt noted Places of Engliſh Trade with the Indians. This River, beſides vaſt Extents of good Land, is furniſhed with Salt on an Eaſtern Branch, and Red Bole, on Necunsia Skeintat. The Stream is very gentle, and paſſable with large Battoes a great Way up, and with Canoes near 200 Miles to a Portage near the Head, where you carry over good Ground four Miles to Sanduſki. <hi>Sanduſki</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">Sanduſki, F n, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Place.</note> is a conſiderable River, abounding in level rich Land, its Stream gentle all the Way to the Mouth, where it will receive conſiderable Sloops. This River is an important Paſs, and the French have ſecured it as ſuch; the Northern Indians croſs the Lake here from Iſland to Iſland
<note n="§" place="margin">E n</note>, land at San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſki, and go by a direct Path to the Lower Shawane Town, and thence to the Gap of Ouaſioto, in their Way to the Cuttawas Country. This will no Doubt be the Way that the French will take from <hi>Detroit</hi> to <hi>Moville,</hi> unleſs the Engliſh will be adviſed to ſecure it, now that it is in their Power.</p>
               <p>LITTLE MINEAMI River
<note n="‖" place="margin">Little Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neami River. H p</note> is too ſmall to be gone far with Canoes. It has much fine Land, and ſome Salt Springs; its high Banks, and middling Current, prevent its overflowing much the ſurrounding Land.</p>
               <p>GREAT MINEAMI River, Afferenîët, or Rocky River
<note n="§" place="margin">Rocky Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. G p</note>, has a very ſtony Channel, a ſwift Stream, but no Falls. It has ſeveral large Branches, paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with Canoes a great Way; one
<note n="‖" place="margin">H q</note> extending Weſtward towards the Quia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aghtena River; another towards a Branch of Mineami River (which runs into Lake Erie) to which there is a Portage, and a third has a Portage to the Weſt Branch of Sanduſki; beſides Mad Creek, where the French have lately eſtabliſhed themſelves. A Vein of elevated Land, here and there a little ſtony, which begins in the Northern Part of the Peninſula, between the Lakes Erie, Huron and Michigan, extends acroſs the Lake Mineami Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, below the Fork, and Southward along the Rocky River, to Ohio; and is the Reaſon of this River's being ſtony, and the Grounds riſing a little higher than the adjacent Plains. It is, like all the Land on this River, very rich, and would ſcarce have been perceived, had not the River worn the Channel down to the Rocks which lie beneath.</p>

E o</note> a conſiderable Stream, navigable with Canoes to the Portages, which lead to the Quiaaghtena and Rocky River, interrupted with three conſiderable Rifts below the Forks: But however it is an important River, becauſe of the Portages it furniſhes South-Weſtward.</p>
               <p>WERE there nothing at Stake between the Crowns of Britain and France, but the Lands on that Part of Ohio included in this Map, we may reckon it as great a Prize, as has ever yet been contended for, between two Nations; but if we further obſerve, that this is ſcarce a Quarter of the valuable Land, that is contained in one continued Extent, and the Influence that a State, veſted with all the Wealth and Power that will naturally ariſe from the Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſo great an Extent of good Land, in a happy Climate, it will make ſo great an Addition to that Nation which wins it, where there is no third State to hold the Ballance of Power, that the Loſer muſt inevitably ſink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Rival. It is not as two Nations at War, contending the one for the other's Habitations; where the Conquered, on Submiſſion, would be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to partake of the Privileges of the Conquerors; but for a vaſt Country, exceeding in Extent and good Land all the European Dominions of Britain, France and Spain, almoſt deſtitute of Inhabitants, and will as faſt as the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans ſettle become more to of its former Inhabitants. It is impoſſible to conceive, that had his Majeſty been made acquainted with its Value, the large Strides the French have been making, for ſeveral Years paſt, in their Incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on his Dominions; and the Meaſures ſtill taken to keep the Colonies diſunited, and of impeding the generous Attempts of his moſt zealous Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; his Majeſty would have ſacrificed, to the Spleen of a few bitter Spirits, the beſt Gem in his Crown. It is not yet too late to retrieve the whole, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided</hi> the Britiſh Plantations are not thought to be grown already too large— if ſuch an Opinion prevails, an Opportunity now offers of ſoon making them leſs.
<note place="margin">The Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable than commonly ſuppoſed.</note> We may reckon the Repreſentation of the Extent and Power of the Plantations being great, and that ſuch Power may be dangerous to their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Country, amongſt the greateſt of vulgar Errors. Any Perſon, who knows the Nature of the Soil, and the Extent of our Settlements, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that all the Land, worth the Culture, from New Hampſhire to Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, and extended as far back as there are Planters ſettled within three or four Miles of one another, though including nine Colonies, is not equal in Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity to Half the arable Land in England.

Suppoſing the Colonies were grown rich and powerful, what Inducement have they to throw off their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency? National Ties of Blood and Friendſhip; mutual Dependencies for Support and Aſſiſtance, in their civil and military Intereſts, with England; each Colony having a particular Form of Government of its own, and the Jealouſy of either's having the Superiority over the reſt, are unſurmountable Obſtacles to their ever uniting, to the Prejudice of England, upon any am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Views of their own. But, that repeated and continued ill Uſage, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringements of their dear-bought Privileges, ſacrificing them to the Ambition and Intrigues of domeſtic and foreign Enemies, may not provoke them to do their utmoſt, for their own Preſervation, I would not pretend to ſay; as weak as they are. But while they are treated as Members of one Body, and allowed their natural Rights, it would be the Height of Madneſs for them to propoſe an Independency, were they ever ſo ſtrong. If they had any ambitious Views,
<note place="margin">A ſtrong Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony of the Enemy near, dangerous.</note> a ſtrong Colony, of a natural Enemy to England, on their Borders, would be the only Article that would render any Attempt of Independency truly dangerous; and for that Reaſon it becomes thoſe who would regard the future Intereſt of Britain and its Colonies, to ſuppreſs the Growth of the French Power, and not the Engliſh, in America.</p>
