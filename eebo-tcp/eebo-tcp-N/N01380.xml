            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>THe Examination of the</hi> Portſmouth <hi>Diſpute</hi> does not pretend to Elegancy of Stile, nor accurateneſs of Method, nor to pleaſe the learned Critick (the Author having this dozen years laboured under the diſadvantage of a ſmall Maintenance and a great Family, whereby thoſe few Notions of Learning which he had, have almoſt ſlipt his Memory) He only conſults the Edification of the <hi>Reader,</hi> by plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laying open the Falacies of falſe
<pb facs="unknown:001635_0003_0FB3E21DAD97E7D0"/>Argument, and honeſtly Teaching and proving the <hi>Truth</hi> from holy Scripture. It does not expect to go free from the Carps of <hi>Momus,</hi> nor to be without Fault; but it hopes to have ſo much Vertue, by having the Truth on its ſide, as to induce the Vertuous to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look its Infirmities. It does not ſeek to findout all the Faults of thoſe it Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, but only to anſwer what makes againſt the Truth: Neither does it ſpare Friends nor Enemies, where it thinks them materially out of the way. The Book which it undertakes to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe being chiefly ſpread in that part of the Country where the Author dwells, and there being no opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that he was ſure of, to imploy an abler hand with ſo much ſpeed as the Truth of the Goſpel of Chriſt, the true Worſhip of God, and the good of Mens Souls (and, as he is perſwaded,

               <salute>Chriſtian Reader;</salute>

            <p>IT is a very Awful thing for a Perſon to be deceived in his Faith; and it is an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable Evil, when a perſon, thro' ſloath or prejudice, will not love the Truth, ſo as to ſubmit to the Evidence of it, when it is laid before him.</p>
            <p>Some Errors are ſuch, that he that believes them will be Damned, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11, 12. but others are ſuch, that except a perſon willfully hold them, againſt the evidence of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, they may be ranked among the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities even of Believers.</p>
            <p>Of this latter kind, I take the enſuing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy to be, and therefore have been always loath to meddle with it. Not but that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is well worth the labour, and is in it ſelf a great Duty; but leſt by ſo doing I ſhould do the leſs in things, which more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concern <hi>Judgment, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> and leſt by ſtriving to mend Faults in the Practice of the <hi>Outſide</hi> part of Religon, I ſhould ſtir up ſtrife and cauſe people to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the <hi>inward</hi> part of Religion, and break the bands of Love to one another, and ſo
<pb facs="unknown:001635_0006_0FB3E2222C6DB3F8"/>make a greater Fault than I mend; belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who hold and live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the eſſential part of Religion, ought to Love one another, and bear with one anothers Infirmities, and prudently to avoid thoſe things, which otherwiſe might be very needful, rather than make a <hi>Rent</hi> and <hi>Schiſm</hi> (and ſo hinder mutual Edification) in the more <hi>vital</hi> part of Religion. For a perſon may be baptized and yet be a very wicked Man; but a Man cannot exerciſe <hi>ſound Repentance,</hi> a <hi>lively Faith, true Humility, unfeigned Love,</hi> and a <hi>holy Life,</hi> and yet be a wicked Man.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I always avoided theſe Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, yet carefully practiſed that which I believe the <hi>Right,</hi> and never refuſed to give my Reaſons for what I held, when I was asked.</p>
            <p>But now I am called to ſpeak, and dare no longer keep ſilence, becauſe of a Book, which I have formerly read (hoping, if I was in an Error, to be <hi>Convinced,</hi> but if in the Truth, <hi>Confirmed</hi>) and returned it to the Owner, but made no ſtir about it, becauſe it was not very publick.</p>
            <p>But of late this Book is Re-printed, and ſpread among us, and given among the People
<pb facs="unknown:001635_0007_0FB3E223A30D82C0"/>under my Charge, as well as among others; and many people, who hold with it, glory in it abundantly.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, I knowing the falſe Arguments and other unſufferable Evils in it, do account it would be ſinful Silence in me to be ſilent, when I ſee not only Gentlemen, not here to ſpeak for themſelves (I think) ſlandered, but alſo the Truth run down, Falſhood believed, and the Weak deceived, and, it may be, ſome ſeduced from the right Way of Worſhip, whom it is my Charge to defend, I may not wait till it can be done by an abler hand, nor take much time about it my ſelf; but it is ſo eaſie to anſwer that there is little need of either.</p>
            <p>If my writing increaſe <hi>Anger,</hi> and hinder <hi>Love</hi> in ſome, I cannot help it; I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to treat the erroncous Narrator with as eaſie Language as the Truth will bear.</p>
            <p>But the chief deſign of this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> is to intreat the <hi>Reader,</hi> for Gods ſake, and for his Souls fake, to take heed and lay aſide all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice when he comes to read this, &amp; compare with that, what it undertakes to anſwer.</p>
            <p>I adviſe him (if he be a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>) to make his earneſt Requeſt at the Throne of Grace, before he read it, That God would (in his infinite Mercy in Jeſus Chriſt) cauſe him to
<pb facs="unknown:001635_0008_0FB3E22520904DC0"/>ſee and believe the Truth, and ſave him from believing Error, or rejecting the Evidence of Truth, whether it be on the One part or the Other. For which end, that he take away all prevailing Prejudice, or deſire of believing the one or the other, leſt he be like thoſe <hi>who did not receive the love of the Truth, and ſo God gave them up to ſtrong Deluſions to believe a Lye, that they might be Damned.</hi> Know, that all your Will and Reaſon and Means will neither bring you <hi>TO</hi> nor keep you <hi>IN</hi> the Truth, without Gods bleſſing, which is not promiſed, except you ſeek aright, <hi>James</hi> 4.3, 4.</p>
            <p>Pray do not make the Reading of this a hindrance to your Exerciſe in the ſpiritual part of Religion, but while you are informing your ſelf in the Doctrine of the <hi>Adminiſtration of Baptiſm,</hi> let your chief care be to be made Partaker of the <hi>Grace</hi> repreſented in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> otherwiſe you will have the <hi>Shell</hi> without the <hi>Kirnell.</hi>
            </p>

                  <hi>2dly.</hi> In the Dedication they tell, that Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon</hi> gave one of them the <hi>Lye,</hi> but I do not find it in the Narrative, which, ſince they have publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed it here, I conclude, it would not have been wanting there, if their Memory would have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to know where to place it; which ſhews that there is much wanting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> In ſix or eight hours Diſcourſe without Intermiſſion, would have made a much larger Volumn than the Whole Book, whereas a great part of the Book is made up of other matter, as the Dedication, &amp;c. and many remarks of Dr. <hi>Ruſſels</hi> after the Diſpute, and his Quotations in the end of the Book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly,</hi> I find ſeveral times that he tells us of a long Diſcourſe of one of their Antagoniſts about ſuch or ſuch a thing, but relates little of it, and ſometimes ſays it was not worth Writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>5thly. I</hi> have heard ſeveral wayes, and from ſuch as know not each other, that this is a falſe Narrative, and that it has occaſioned the true (really taken from the Town-Clerks) Notes to be alſo printed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>6thly.</hi> Another Reaſon, which confirms me in it, is, that according to this Narrative the <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> have acted as if their very deſign was to give away their Cauſe, by calling a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude together to hear, and then purpoſely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to diſpute, but always making ſure to
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001635_0011_0FB3E229AE743A28"/>leave room to be anſwered, and giving their Opponents opportunity to frame their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and pretending to anſwer them, but always making ſure to leave them them unanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered. It can hardly be that they were ſerious if this Narrative be True.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>7thly.</hi> I find much ſaid by him, but little by his Antagoniſts through the Book, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>My <hi>8th Reaſon</hi> I leave till afterwards. But is not this very unfair, (not to call it worſe) if they not only to detract from Mens Reputation, but alſo deceive people (by a falſe Narrative) in things concerning their Salvation; (making people believe, this is the ſtrength of what is alledged againſt their way, when indeed it is not the tenth part, yea, <hi>I</hi> may ſay, not the hundredth part of it, as to ſolid Arguments) For the tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of the truth, and leaving out a part, is many times as pernicious Lying, as utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down-right falſhood, and many times does more harm, becauſe it is more eaſily believed. And if I may ſay it, without Comparing the Narrator to him, the Devil, the Father of Lyes does, for the moſt part, exerciſe his moſt hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful falſhood this way. However, <hi>I</hi> will hope that the Narrator (having ſo light an eſteem of the Arguments which he thinks are againſt the truth) did ſet down all the Arguments brought againſt him, which he thought had any weight in them ſo far as they came to his knowledge.</p>
               <p>Yet I muſt, as a Friend, adviſe the <hi>Antipaedo-Baptiſts</hi> to diſown this Narrative, (under theſe circumſtances) left they make people think they
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001635_0012_0FB3E22B214862C0"/>reſemble the Kingdom of the Devil, which is built up by Lyes, and leſt people think they are conſcious, that their Cauſe is ſo weak that truth alone is not ſufficient to defend it, and left People think it is not for <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſake that they hold their way, but from ſome am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Contentions and uncharitable Diſpoſition; For any one may know, that he, that holds any Tenet for Conſcience-ſake, will deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Truth to defend it, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will oblige him as ſoon to believe the contrary, when he ſees good Evidence for it. But whether this Narrative be true or falſe, the Truth is the Truth, if thoſe men could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it. And it not being defended in this Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, is the reaſon of my writing this Reply.</p>
               <p>I take Notice alſo of (<hi>I</hi> think) a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in the Title-page it is ſaid, <hi>It was taken from two Copies taken at the Diſpute;</hi> And in the Dedication he tells us of other Letters, his Memory, &amp;c. If part of it was taken from thoſe Copies, yet it is not true to ſay, the Narrative was, except it was all.</p>
               <p>I alſo obſerve in the Dedication, That Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſeems to be concern'd for his own honour, by publiſhing to the world, <hi>That his Preaching was approved,</hi> and how he deſerves <hi>the Title of Doctor,</hi> and being concerned left his partner, Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> ſhould have the greateſt ſhare of the <hi>Honour of their Days works,</hi> ſaying, <hi>What he ſpoke was far ſhort of what Dr.</hi> Ruſſel <hi>ſpoke.</hi> But it may be he had good cauſe for all this.</p>
               <p>So <hi>I</hi> proceed to their Arguements, wherein I
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001635_0013_0FB3E22CC09FFD08"/>ſhall always repeat the <hi>Medium,</hi> and ſo much more, that the Argument compoſed, ſhall be clearly underſtood, and I hope to leave none of their Arguments unanſwered, either directly, or by anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wering other Arguments; and ſuch as queſtion it may have recourſe to the Narrative it ſelf, which is now plentiful in the Country.</p>
               <p>In the General, I find not one Argument uſed by them, but what is either a Fallacy or improved into a Fallacy. And never did I before ſee ſo much Sophiſtry put together and approved by a learned Man. If it had been one that knew not the Rules of Argument, he might be better excuſed. I am ſorry to offend his Friends, by ſaying it, but I dare not mince the Truth when I am called to ſpeak; He has often ſaid worſe of his Antagoniſts, both in his Dedication and Narrative, and that without cauſe. But <hi>I</hi> muſt proceed to ſhew that <hi>I</hi> have cauſe to ſay this.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Whether, according to the Commiſſion of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, Adult believers are only the proper Subjects of</hi> Baptiſm, <hi>and not Infants?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> takes it in the Affirmative, and his firſt Argument is,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:001635_0014_0FB3E22EE2751B20"/>
                  <hi>If Chriſt hath no where required any of his Miniſters to Baptize Infants, then the Baptiſm of Infants is not according to the Commiſſion of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Chriſt hath no where required any of his Miniſters to Baptize Infants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Argument is well enough according to the Rule, but his fallacy is in proving it, as we ſhall ſee by his inſiſting to have them expreſſed in the Commiſſion, ſaying, <hi>That ſome are expreſly Commanded to be Baptized in the Commiſſion.</hi> The fallacy lies here, <hi>[Expreſſed]</hi> is a Word that may be taken ſeveral ways, and ſo have one ſignification in the <hi>Major,</hi> and another in the <hi>Minor,</hi> which will neceſſarily make a falſe concluſion, as every Logician well knows. For thus it is, Some are expreſſed in the Commiſſion, viz. <hi>Believers</hi> and <hi>Diſciples,</hi> but the Commiſſion does not tell us, whether they be <hi>Adult</hi> or <hi>Infants,</hi> it may be either or both, or neither, if a third ſort could be found, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe Words; But under the Name of Believers and Diſciples are expreſſed the perſons that are ſo, whether Adult or Infants.</p>
               <p>But to ſhew his fallacy, and prove the contrary to his Minor,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> By his way of arguing, and their way of Anſwering (as here related) he would have been as hard put to it to prove Adult perſons included in the Commiſſion; for they are no more expreſſed than Infants; But by as good Conſequence as expreſs Words, ſome Adult perſons are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001635_0015_0FB3E22FA2903C70"/>and others included; and I hope by Gods Grace to make the ſame appear of Infants.</p>
               <p>Yea, by his arguing, how will he prove himſelf <hi>a Miniſter,</hi> ſeeing he is not <hi>experſſed</hi> in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> argue the very ſame againſt Baptiſm with Watter, becauſe Water is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Commiſſion, or any Command; and in truth, they have equal Reaſon for it, and I know not one of his Arguments to prove his firſt by, but what the <hi>Quakers</hi> uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> That Infants are as much expreſſed in the Commiſſion as the Adulte I prove thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All that are Believers in Chriſt are included in the Commiſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But There are Infants who are Believers in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ergo, <hi>There are Infants included in the Commſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Major will not be diſputed. The Minor I Prove thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All that are ſaved by Chriſt are Believers in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But there are Infants ſaved by Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ergo, <hi>There are Infants who are Believers in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Minor I think will be granted: The Major I ſhall prove. But firſt, to feed the <hi>Antipedobaptiſts</hi> with a little of their own meat, I cite <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that Believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> The foregoing Words, <hi>He that Believeth and is Baptized,</hi> is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>them</hi> with that <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. to prove that a profesſion of faith is pre-requiſite to baptiſm.</p>
               <p>I argue, either theſe texts concern only the Adult, or it concerns Adult and Infants both. If it concern only the Adult, then Infants are not concerned in it, and if Infants are not concerned
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001635_0016_0FB3E231208AB428"/>in it, then here is nothing to be proved for or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Infants Baptiſm by it. Yea, ſuppoſe Infants have not Faith, theſe Scriptures ſpeaking nothing of them, but only of Adult, that Faith is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary pre-requiſit to Baptiſm in them which Believe and practiſe. Theſe Texts do not prove but that Infants may be Baptized without Faith, though Adult may not, as well as be ſaved without Faith, as the <hi>Antipedobaptiſts</hi> believe they are. Therefore if theſe and ſuch like Texts concern not Infants, let them not plead any more <hi>Believe and be baptized,</hi> againſt Infants Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>They muſt take ſome other Arguments to deny them Baptiſm, if they will do it.</p>
               <p>But if ſuch Texts do concern Adult and Infants both, then it muſt follow of Infants ſo well as Adult They either are Believers, or elſe they are Damned. But there are Infants, who dye in Infancy, are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and not damned. Therefore they are Believers, and therefore ſo well or as much expreſſed in the Commiſſion as adult Believers.</p>
               <p>But take it either way, and it is as rational to infer from ſuch Scriptures, that Infants are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as that they are not the Subjects of Baptiſm. But they ſay, <hi>Infants cannot have Faith for want of the Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Will.</hi> pag. 54.</p>
               <p>I Reply,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> A Man has not the exerciſe or act of his Underſtanding when he is a ſleep, and few men have it when they dye, ſhall we from thence infer that they dye Unbelievers, and are damned, or that Unbelievers are ſaved?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> This which is the foundation of denying
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001635_0017_0FB3E232A26A8FE8"/>Infants Baptiſm, is wholy Unſcriptural, and againſt expreſs Scripture, and is the very ſame Argument uſed by the <hi>Pelagians</hi> to deny Original ſin; and if the one may be denyed by it, the other may alſo. Or does God require more to conſtitute a good Act than he imputes to be an evil Act? But hence many <hi>Antipedobaptists</hi> deny original Sin with <hi>Pelagius</hi> their Father. Therefore I adviſe ſuch of them as believe Original Sin, to reject this Argument, leſt they bring in that Old Hereſy, and overthrow all ſound Repentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> It matters not to us in what ſence they may be ſaid to believe, ſo long as God owns them for Believers, by giving them the Priviledge of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, which is Salvation. I argue thus:</p>
               <p>Thoſe that God does own for Believers, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them the Priviledge of Believers, we ought to own for Believers included in the Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>But God doth own Infants for Believers, by giving them the Priviledge of Believers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> we ought to own them for Believers inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>If they deny the Major, let then ſhew us by what Rule they can ſhew us, that God requires us to make a diffrence, where he makes none.</p>
               <p>If they deny the Minor, they muſt deny that Infants are ſaved by Faith, and ſo bring in a new way of Salvation, never heard of in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> will not here plead for the <hi>Acts</hi> of Faith, nor undertake to prove a <hi>Habit</hi> of Faith in infants; It matters not, whether I know what it is or no, ſo long as I know it is that which God accepts of for Faith, and therefore that His Miniſters ought to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001635_0018_0FB3E23426E1C028"/>do it alſo, and that God does give them the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Believers by ſaving them, and therefore that his Miniſters ought to do it by Baptizing them.</p>
               <p>But to prove that Infants are ſaved by Faith, whatever that Faith be, I argue,</p>
               <p>All that are ſaved, are in this World ſanctifyed, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Holineſs without which no man</hi> (or as the prime Signification of the Word <hi>oudeis</hi> is <hi>no one</hi>) <hi>ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Eccl. 11.3.</p>
               <p>But there are Infants that are ſaved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> there are Infants in this World ſanctifyed.</p>
               <p>I hope they will not ſay that this Text alſo ſpeaks only of the Adult, and ſo that Infants may be ſaved without Holineſs, and ſo make God unholy, which they muſt do, or grant my Argument, or elſe deny Original Sin, as <hi>Pelagius</hi> a Heretick about four hunderd Years after Chriſt, denyed Infant Baptiſm, and with ſome reaſon, according to his principle; For he denyed Original Sin, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving they had no Sin nor pollution by Sin, be believed they needed no cleanſing nor Sign of cleanſing.</p>
               <p>So denying Infants Baptiſm, and denying Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin agree excellent well together, as has been ſhewn before, and may be ſhewed again.</p>
               <p>But becauſe ſome <hi>Antipedobaptiſts</hi> will deny any thing rather than yield, I digreſs one word for that.</p>
               <p>All that Chriſt came to ſave are ſinners,</p>
               <p>But Chriſt came to ſave Infants,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infants are Sinners.</p>
               <p>The Major is evident, the Miner <hi>I</hi> prove thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:001635_0019_0FB3E235A862E1E8"/>
If none under Heaven among men can be ſaved but by Chriſt, then Infants cannot be ſaved but by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But none under Heaven among men can be ſaved but by Chriſt. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See Acts 4 12. The Greek word here <hi>[anthropes]</hi> as here uſed, ſignifies, <hi>All Men, Women</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> not one excepted. Therefore Infants are Sinners.</p>
               <p>As the Faith of Infants, ſo their Sin is that which <hi>I</hi> do not undertake to deſcribe: But thus far I think, no man of reaſon can deny to follow of conſequence, That as our Saviour, ſo <hi>Adam</hi> being a publick Perſon, to act in ſome things for his Poſterity, <hi>Adam</hi> by ſin having loſt that which is greateſt of all, <hi>viz.</hi> his Right and Title to <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Delight,</hi> in the enjoyment of the light of Gods Countenance, could not leave it to his Poſterity, and ſo they are born without a Title to it, and cannot recover it but by that which God accepts of for Faith in Chriſt. And that he, having loſt his Priviledge of ever being received into Glory, <hi>by keeping the Law,</hi> could not leave that Priviledge to his Children, and ſo they are born without it, and now cannot be received into Glory but by Faith in Chriſt. And <hi>Adam</hi> having his whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture corrupted with <hi>an averſion</hi> from God and Holineſs, could not beget Children of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore they cannot be received into Glory, till they are ſanctified. So <hi>I</hi> argue,</p>
               <p>If Sanctification cannot be without Faith, then all that are Sanctified have Faith.</p>
               <p>But ſanctification cannot be without Faith.</p>
               <p>Therefore all that are ſanctified, have Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:001635_0020_0FB3E2372CB08188"/>
The ſequel of the <hi>Major</hi> is ſelf evident. The Proof of the <hi>Minor</hi> we ſhall hear more afterwards. So I argue,</p>
               <p>If Infants are Sanctifyed, Infants have Faith.</p>
               <p>But Infants are Sanctifyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infants have Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> Gods Love to Man is diſtinguiſhed into a Love of <hi>Benevolence,</hi> or willing them Good, a Love of <hi>Beneficence,</hi> or doing them Good; and a Love of <hi>Complacency,</hi> or being pleaſed with them. With a Love of Benevolence God Loves his Elect from Eternity; and before their Converſion or Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, with a Love of Beneficence when he does them good; and with a Love of Complacency, when they are ſanctified, and not before.</p>
               <p>So <hi>I</hi> argue,</p>
               <p>All that are fit to be ſaved, God loves with a Love of Complacency, <hi>i. e.</hi> they pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>But there are Infants fit to be ſaved, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed.</p>
               <p>Therefore there are Infants that pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> think neither part will or can be denyed by any.</p>
               <p>Hence <hi>I</hi> argue,</p>
               <p>None can pleaſe God but ſuch as have Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.</p>
               <p>But there are Infants that pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> there are Infants that have Faith.</p>
               <p>If any object and ſay, it is after their death that they are ſanctifyed and pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> anſwer;</p>
               <p>It muſt be a true work, if not a perfect work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore death, except we bring in a new Goſpel of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation after Death.</p>

It matters Not to us what this Regeneration &amp; Faith in Infants is, ſo long as it is ſomething real, and God accepts it.</p>

                  <hi>3dly. I</hi> having from two undeniable arguments proved Infants Faith, proceed to expreſs Scripture, Mat. 18.6. <hi>Whoſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones that believe in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this is ſpoken properly of a little <hi>Child</hi> or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant (whatever ſome Annotators may ſay) appears from theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> If it were not litterally a little child or Infant, the end of our Saviours calling or ſetting him before his diſciples was loſt. For a Child of ſome Years is angry, contentious, deceitful, proud, &amp;c. which evils this was to convince them of. It muſt have been a child who by reaſon of his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age had none of theſe faults. I think it muſt have been a very young Infant; And if it had been one called a child, becauſe of his child-like Humility, &amp;c. this was no ſign to thoſe that knew not his heart, and they would have thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as good as he.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> If this be admitted, we know not when the Scripture ſpeaks properly, nor where parables.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>4thly.</hi> It is ever a Rule, for the right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture, to take it litterally, where there is no neceſſity to underſtand it otherwiſe, to take the plain obvious Signification; and here can be no pretence for taking it otherwiſe, except</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt. He called him.</hi> Whether it was the Child or h<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001635_0022_0FB3E23A212759B8"/>for ſuch as were brought, were ſaid to come. Chap. 19.13, 14. But a Child that is a perfect Infant in underſtanding may go alone, and underſtand to be called.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Such a child may be offended.</hi> I anſwer;</p>
               <p>If offending be taken for <hi>Afflicting</hi> or making <hi>ſorrowful,</hi> this may be done to a young ſucking Child.</p>
               <p>If offending be taken for <hi>Diſhonour, Reproach and Scandal,</hi> this may be done to an Infant new born, by denying him to be a member of Chriſt's Church, and ſo ranking him among the Heathen.</p>
               <p>If it be taken for a <hi>Stumbling-block</hi> and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his Edification, this may be done by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to be brought up where he ſhall not learn to know his Maker, Redeemer and Sanctifyer, or by ſetting evil examples before him when he begins to come to underſtanding, and while he is yet an Infant, as to his being capable of any knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> A third pretence is, that <hi>ſuch a Child is ſaid to believe in Chriſt.</hi> And the fear of believing this, is it that makes ſome ſo loath to believe this place litterally; For ſome men will bend Gods Holy Word any way rather then bend themſelves to that. But to ſay, they have that which God owns for Faith, and is as ſufficient for them as the Faith of adult perſons is for them, takes away this objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now ſeeing all the other objections are taken away, <hi>I</hi> have not only inconteſtable proofs from Scripture <hi>Conſequence,</hi> but expreſs Scripture Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that there are little Children or Infants which do believe in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And from the Text and Context <hi>I</hi> do infer and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001635_0023_0FB3E23BA67CCC68"/>aver, that there are little Children, who are ſo young and ſmall, that no evil example can be found in them, becauſe they are uncapable of it, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their tender age, of whom it may be ſaid, <hi>They do believe in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence I argue,</p>
               <p>All that are Believers are included in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for Baptiſm.</p>

               <p>Hence to anſwer Dr. <hi>Ruſſels</hi> firſt argument, I ſay,</p>
               <p>The Commiſſion for Baptiſm includes infants.</p>
               <p>Chriſt has required his Miniſters to baptize all ſuch as the Commiſſion includes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt has required his Miniſters to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize infants.</p>
               <p>And it muſt be the ſame way that we prove any Adult perſon to be included in the Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>Thus far in anſwer to Dr. <hi>Ruſſels</hi> firſt Argument, and his ſaying, <hi>That neither Mr.</hi> Chandler <hi>nor any other perſon whatſoever could ſhow, that it is recorded in holy Scripture, that Chriſt has required any of his Miniſters to Baptize infants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if by <hi>Recorded</hi> he mean <hi>in expreſs words,</hi> I challenge him to ſhow that he has required the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of Adult perſons <hi>in expreſs words;</hi> But if the expresſing ſuch as believe, be to expreſs ſome Adult, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

If any enquire what infants we ſhall look upon as Believers, let him look for that in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: I need not trace all his words, having as I think fully anſwered all his allegations.

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>On Dr.</hi> Ruſſel'<hi>s ſecond Argument.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>His Second Argument is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Infants are not capable to be made Diſciples of Chriſt by the Miniſtry of Men, then they cannot poſſibly be the ſubject of Baptiſm intended in Chriſts Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Infants are not capable to be made Diſciples of Chriſt by the Miniſtry of Men. Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I deny his <hi>Minor,</hi> and affirm the contrary. For their Parents being brought into the School of Chriſt, to be learners of the Word, and that by the Miniſtry of Men; this brings the Children alſo in, and they no ſooner begin to underſtand, but they begin to learn, and that by vertue of their Parents Diſcipleship, without any further work of the Miniſtry than what was improved on their Parents. So the Miniſtry of Men is the cauſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually of their being learners of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and a Diſciple is nothing but a Learner. It matters not whether the Miniſtry be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001635_0025_0FB3E23EC59B4D80"/>the cauſe of their diſcipleship, or mediately by their Parents, ſo it be the cauſe in Gods hand. We ſee by experience that the Children of true Diſciples are always <hi>thus</hi> diſcipled; and they were entred in the School the day that their Parents were either Converted or brought to acknowledge the Truth' and ſeriouſly to Learn it, and if they are born afterwards, they are born in the School, and devoted to be learners of Chriſt. But it is not ſo with the Children of <hi>Heathen</hi> or other Prophane Perſons, who teach not their children as Diſciples ought to be taught in <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> anſwered well, by diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>incompleat</hi> Diſciples; But this Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> could not bear, nor be found to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it.</p>
               <p>The truth is, it was too hard for him, and ſo he blames ſuch <hi>Diſtinctions</hi> as <hi>Equivocable Expreſſions.</hi> Surely Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> muſt know that Diſtinctions are abſolutely neceſſary for the right underſtanding of the Truth, whether in Divinity or Philoſophy, and what elſe is intended by thoſe Words, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Rightly dividing the word of Truth.</hi> And in Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, one ſpecial uſe of Diſtinctions is to avoid the Fallacy of Equivocable Expreſſions. It is a general Rule <hi>Qui bene diſtinguit, bene docet.</hi> He that Diſtinguiſhes well, Teacheth well. But this was one of the Doctors Remarks after the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute was over, which might take with the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Reader, and, it may be, help prevail with him to be plunged before he ſhould hear it anſwered, <hi>I</hi> think he knew that we uſe this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001635_0026_0FB3E2402C0C7958"/>and it was his bufineſs to make appear that there is no ſuch diſtinction, if he did not believe it.</p>
               <p>An infant is an in compleat Subject of the King. He is a real Subject, and the King defends him for a ſubject, and yet he cannot perform one action of Subjection.</p>
               <p>As God does not expect that of any Creature, which he never made him capable of, ſo we do not expect that the Faith or diſcipleſhip is the ſame with that of Adult perſons, who are capable of more, yet we believe it as acceptable with God, who has no need of our Service, and that what God has affixed his promiſe to in them, is as effectual a means for them as hearing and learning is for grown perſons. So I argue,</p>
               <p>If God own the infants of believing Parents, giving them the Bleſſings that belong to Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, obliging himſelf to them by his Covenant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, owning them as <hi>nigh</hi> and not afar off, and giving to ſome of them ſanctifying Grace, which implyes all that he does for grown Diſciples, and that on the account of their Parents diſcipleſhip, then he owns them as Diſciples, &amp; we ought to own them as Diſciples</p>
               <p>But all this God does for them, and that on the account of their Parents Diſeipleſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now all that are brough into the School of Chriſt, or born in the School, they and their Children, ſo continuing, are under Gods Covenant promiſe, &amp; therefore he gives to them all ſaving Grace, except they tranſgreſs the Condition after, which we do
<pb n="19"
                      facs="unknown:001635_0027_0FB3E241A5AD1C70"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>not know that infants can do.</p>
               <p>And Heathens alſo after they are called and brought in, are under this Promiſe.</p>
               <p>But what God does with the Infants of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, he has not told us, and ſo it is none of our buſineſs to enquire; Nor has he told us what he does with any infants that are not devoted to be learners of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now that ſaving Grace is the thing promiſed, appears <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.3.5. and that this promiſe is made to grown Diſciples and their Children, appears <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. <hi>I</hi> argue.</p>
               <p>Either the Children of thoſe new Believers were of the number of thoſe afar off, or they were not.</p>
               <p>If they were, then their Parents were alſo; for it may be either three ſorts, or but one ſort that are ſpoken of. If but one ſort, then the Parents, Children, and ſtrangers were all the ſame perſons, which is the greateſt Non-ſenſe; But the Scripture ſpeaks of them as three ſorts, whereof <hi>Two</hi> are nigh, and <hi>One</hi> afar off.</p>
               <p>But if they were not afar off, then they were nigh, that is, of the Church <hi>de Jure,</hi> and ſo under the Covenant-Promiſe; for there are but thoſe afar off, and thoſe that are nigh, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>World</hi> and the <hi>Church.</hi> See more Eph. 2.12. to 18. where alſo we find, that thoſe afar off <hi>were ſtrangers to the Covenant of Promiſe,</hi> and this being a property of their unhappineſs, it muſt be, that thoſe that were nigh, were not ſtrangers to it. Therefore the Children of believing Parents being not afar off, out nigh, are not ſtranger to it, but fellows citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens under the Priveledge of Diſciples contained in the promiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20"
                      facs="unknown:001635_0028_0FB3E2432A9DBE88"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
So it follows,</p>
               <p>That the Children of grown Diſciples are belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, who are made ſo by the Miniſtry of Men, have the ſame Priviledges of Gods Covenant-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe with their Parents, and the Miniſtry is the cauſe of both, by one Act. Now as Dr <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſays, <hi>That which God hath joyned, let no man put aſunder.</hi> Let him ſhow us a Rule to ſhut out ſuch as God has received, and by what Rule God has required or allowed us to receive Parents without their Children, when we read not of any Perſon baptized who had a Houſhold, but his Houſhold was alſo baptized, that <hi>I</hi> remember.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diſcipleſhip</hi> is nothing but that which brings us under the advantage of obtaining ſaving Grace, or making a greater progreſs and growth therein, by bringing us into that ſtate, which has Gods Promiſe annexed to it, which in grown perſons is, The Diligent uſe of the Means God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, as <hi>Hearing, Learning,</hi> &amp;c. and in Infants it is the <hi>being the Children</hi> of ſuch Parents devoted by Baptiſm, till they are grown big enough to learn, and then by the learning they have from them.</p>
               <p>I do not ſay but that God does uſually defer the giving affectual ſaving Grace to ſuch as live to grow up, till they make choice for themſelves, wherein they have the Promiſe of ſaving Grace, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Salvation, upon condition, that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove well the means which they now enjoy, which Promiſe the <hi>Heathen</hi> have not, and this is to be a Diſciple, or elſe thoſe that left our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.66. were no Diſciples; but if they be not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently Taught, that is their Parents breach of Vow. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:001635_0029_0FB3E2449FFD1A28"/>
                  <hi>I</hi> further argue, from Acts 2.39.</p>
               <p>Either thoſe Words, <hi>As many as the Lord your God ſhall call,</hi> have reference to thoſe Children of Believers, or they have not. If they have, then thoſe Children were not yet called, but ſome of them were to be called, yet thoſe Children were not reckoned among thoſe afar off, <hi>i. e.</hi> the World, and therefore muſt be reckoned among thoſe that were nigh, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Church. They were under Gods ordinary appointed means for Salvation, and ſo Diſciples. Hence I infer, That <hi>Infants of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are to be looked upon as Members of the Church before they are called;</hi> Therefore nigh, and under the Covenant-Promiſe, which is the Ground for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> the Promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. But if thoſe Words have not reference to thoſe Children of Believers, then they are expreſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Promiſe by being the Children of Believers, without reſpect to any other call.</p>
               <p>Chuſe which you will.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſon here given for Baptiſm is the Promiſe; And if Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> can give a Reaſon to cut off the Apoſtles Reaſon, and ſhew us why the Apoſtles Reaſon is not ſufficient for one, ſo well as another, let him do it: In the mean time, till Scripture teach us to make a diffrence, we dare make none.</p>
               <p>Now if Dr. <hi>Ruſſel's</hi> Argument be true, That none may be Baptized but Diſciples, made ſo by the Miniſtry of Men,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> argue,</p>
               <p>All that are under the Covenant promiſe muſt be baptized, according to the Commiſſion (if the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001635_0030_0FB3E24630854F78"/>Apoſtles knew the Commiſſion and acted by it.)</p>
               <p>But Infants are under the Covenant promiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infants are to be baptized, according to the Commiſſion,</p>
               <p>Whence, <hi>All that are to be Baptized, according to the Commiſſion, are made Diſciples by the Miniſtry of Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Infants are to be baptized, according to the Commiſſion;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> Infants are made Diſciples by the Miniſtry of Men; and therefore are capable to be made ſo. And I will believe the Apoſtles of our Lord and Saviour, ſooner than I will believe Dr. <hi>Ruſsel,</hi> who has but his own Reaſon, helped by many ſophiſms, for what he ſays.</p>
               <p>His Error is grounded in the meaning of the Word <hi>Diſciple;</hi> For the Queſtion is, <hi>What is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by it in holy Scripture?</hi> Whether it ſignify one that is <hi>actually taught,</hi> or whether it intend one that is <hi>devoted to be a Learner,</hi> either by himſelf or by another? Dr. <hi>Ruſsel</hi> takes it in the <hi>former</hi> ſenſe; But the Apoſtles of Chriſt took it in the <hi>Latter,</hi> as appears, and I believe they knew beſt. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it is a poor caſe when men will build their Faith upon the acceptation of a Word, which in uſe commonly varys from the <hi>prime</hi> Signification; but that [<hi>Mathetes</hi>] <hi>Diſciple,</hi> need not do, to be taken after one <hi>devoted to be a Learner,</hi> although not yet taught.</p>
               <p>But the Antipoedo Baptiſts object, <hi>That this we bring <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregenerate Perſons into the Church.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> A Perſons bring a Diſciple does not infer his

               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> What the Miniſtry can do, is, to bring them into the School of Chriſt, and inſtruct them there; But it is the Spirit of God that ſanctifies them there, (and has not promiſed to do it any where elſe) which he does ſome Adult and ſome Infants; But neither we, nor ſuch as baptize only Adult Perſons, know certainly who they are; But we muſt judge charitably of all that we find in the School, till their Works prove them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, which if they do, before they are baptized, they ought to be refuſed, and if after it, to be diſowned, &amp;c. Once more,</p>
               <p>Seeing they will have none baptized but ſuch as are made Diſciples by the Miniſtry of Men, yea, and by teaching too, <hi>I</hi> would know, how <hi>Annanias</hi> druſt baptize <hi>Paul,</hi> who was not made a Diſciple by the Miniſtry of Men? If they ſay he had a ſpecial Commisſion, let them ſhew it, or the account of it, ſeeing they vaunt ſo much that they have expreſs Scripture for all they do.</p>
               <p>Thus far againſt Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s ſecond Argument, and to prove the contrary <hi>viz,</hi> that infants of Believers are ſo well Diſciples of Chriſt as their Parents.</p>

But why ſhould they be angry at the diſcovery of falſe reaſons, for ſo they will ſeem to love them</p>

He ſhews his skill in expounding of Scripture, telling us, <hi>That the Apoſtles were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> Mark 16.15, 16. <hi>To baptize ſuch as they had made Diſciples by their Preaching.</hi> Whereas there is not a word of <hi>Diſciples</hi> there. <hi>I</hi> grant that our Lord commanded it, as he commanded the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of Infants or Adult Perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. But ſeeing Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the one, tho' from as good Conſequence, why does he affirm the other, when there is not ſuch a word in the Text?</p>
               <p>Come Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> (to uſe his own way) I beg of you, ſhew me the word [<hi>Diſciple</hi>] there; you ſay it, if you do not ſhew it, the People will think you cannot.</p>
               <p>He next tells us, That in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>They were commanded to Baptize ſuch as they had made</hi> Diſciples <hi>by</hi> Teaching.</p>
               <p>But this is worſe, for Conſequence will hardly
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001635_0033_0FB3E24AA29CCB48"/>help you here, <hi>Doctor.</hi> Here he allows Teaching and Making Diſciples to be two things; for the one may be done by the other. And ſeeing they are Two Things, whereof the one at leaſt may be without the other, how can he infer from hence That the word ſignifies both? For if <hi>Matheteuſate</hi> here ſignifies <hi>Teach ye,</hi> that is all, and [<hi>Make Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>] is not here; for an Old Diſciple may be Taught, who was not made one by this Teaching; but if it ſignifie <hi>Make Diſciples,</hi> that is all, and <hi>Teach</hi> is not here; and if they can be made Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples by other means, they are to Baptize them according to this Commiſſion, and that although they were never Taught, notwithſtanding this Text, but only they were made Diſciples, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be Taught.</p>
               <p>One word may ſignify ſeveral things, but not at one time, but according to what it is uſed for at ſeveral times. You might better have ſaid, <hi>Make Diſciples</hi> by <hi>Baptizing</hi> them; for both theſe words are in the Text, and Baptiſm is an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be a Diſciple; and if it be done by Baptiſm it is alſo done by the Miniſtry of Men.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Matheteuſate</hi>] <hi>Make Diſciples,</hi> is a Verb, and [<hi>Baptizontes</hi>] <hi>Baptizing,</hi> is a Particle, which are uſually uſed together in the Greek Tongue, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs one act; as, [<hi>Apocritheis Eipen</hi>] <hi>Anſwering, ſaid.</hi> So, <hi>Make Diſciples, Baptizing,</hi> may refer to one only act. But where is your <hi>Make Diſciples, Teaching,</hi> when there is but one of the words?</p>
               <p>Thus he will have [<hi>Matheteuſate</hi>] ſignify <hi>Make Diſciples,</hi> when he thinks that will help him (to ſhut out thoſe that God has received.) Then
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001635_0034_0FB3E24CDF874618"/>again, it muſt ſignify <hi>Teach,</hi> when he can improve it beſt ſo. And then he will have it both together, whereas if That be True, it is not in the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that Chriſts Miniſters ſhall preach at all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there be ſome Unbelievers to hear, and be made Diſciples by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctor,</hi> do you expound Scripture thus, when you preach to your People?</p>
               <p>In the next page, he has another Fallacy, for want of the word <hi>Only</hi> in line 23. For it would not be true to ſay, <hi>The Miniſtration of the Goſpel does</hi> only <hi>inform what is good, and what is evil,</hi> and does nothing elſe; and if he ſay not this, he had as good ſay nothing, except to amuſe the ignorant: for there are other things wherein Infants may partake of the Miniſtration of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>I think any one may ſee the Fallacy of ſuch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and learn to avoid ſuch a Teacher. The Lord pity ſuch as build their Faith on ſuch Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
               <p>I have not Room to enlarge upon his ſhufling off Mr <hi>Chandlers</hi> Diſtinction which ſo hurt him, and ſeveral other things. It ſeems his ſureſt way of anſwering, to come off with honour, was, to evade it, and ſo he, as it were, forcibly proceeds to another Argument, leaving <hi>this,</hi> with that which is well if ſome do not ſay is a <hi>Lye;</hi> for he ſaith, That <hi>Mr.</hi> Chandler <hi>had granted every part of his Argument,</hi> when his own Narrative does not tell us (that I can find) any more that was granted than <hi>That Infants cannot be compleat Diſciples, becauſe they know not good and evil,</hi> which I know not that ever any denyed.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>On Dr.</hi> Ruſſel<hi>'s Third and Fourth Arguments, pag.</hi> 29.</head>
               <p>HIs Third Aargument is, That <hi>the Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>did declare all the Counſel of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and yet did never declare Infants Baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This were ſomething, if he could prove it, but which way can that be done, except we had all the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Sermons, that ever he taught? Therefore his bringing this is Ridiculous, and the deſign of it is altogether a Sophiſm, as appears by his way of proving it.</p>
               <p>However, his argument is not true, and I prove the contrary of it, thus.</p>
               <p>All the Counſel of God, with reſpect to our Faith and Practice, was taught by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But all the Commiſſion for Baptiſm, is a part of of the Counſel of God in that reſpect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> all the Commiſſion for Baptiſm was taught by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi> Hence,</p>
               <p>If the Commisſion for Baptiſm includes Infants, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> taught Infants Baptiſm,</p>
               <p>But the Commisſion for Baptiſm includes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:001635_0036_0FB3E24FED3BFC90"/>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> taught Infant Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>The Minor, which only can be objected againſt, <hi>I</hi> have proved before.</p>
               <p>But to return to Dr. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> p. 30.</p>
               <p>His next arguement to prove his Third by, is both falſe in it ſelf, and the Fallacy, called, <hi>The begging of a Principle,</hi> except all <hi>Pauls</hi> Sermons were written in the New Teſtament; But he is ſtill a good help to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> for by the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Baptiſm with Water</hi> may be denyed, if it be not written in the New Teſtament, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> taught it, and I think it was for ſuch Reaſons that a <hi>Palagian Quaker</hi> here was ſo forward to have it Re-printed. And by the ſame Rule we may deny that Buggery is a Sin, or for a Man to marry his Siſter or his Daughter, if it be not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the New Teſtament that <hi>Paul</hi> taught that it is.</p>
               <p>In page 23. he very Uncivilly Scoffs at Mr. <hi>Leigh's</hi> Simile, and yet ſeems as if he were in Sober Earneſt.</p>
               <p>The following pages are almoſt full with his words, but I cannot ſee with what deſign, except to amuſe the ignorant who judge of a Diſpute only by the many Words, Scoffs and Triumphs uſed by the Diſputant. And I fear too many of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes are won by no other means.</p>
               <p>As for inſtance. In the end of the <hi>page</hi> 33, to prove that all that <hi>Paul</hi> taught is recorded in the Scripture, he cites <hi>Acts</hi> 20.27. <hi>I have not ſhunned to declare to you all the Counſel of God.</hi> Admirable Interpreter of Scripture! What is this at all to the purpoſe? If it had been, <hi>I have not ſhunned
<pb n="29"

                         rendition="simple:additions"/>to write in my Epiſtles all the Counſel of God,</hi> it had been ſomething to his purpoſe. All the reſt of his diſcourſe on this Argument is of the ſame Stamp. But <hi>I</hi> preceive his admirers think he has proved all he ſaid <hi>effectually.</hi> The Lord pity them and all that are taught by ſuch as can own ſuch Arguments! if they apply Scripture <hi>thus</hi> alſo, when they teach the ſpiritual part of Religion.</p>
               <p>Page 58. Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> in his remark ſince the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, tells us a ridiculous ſtory of a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſter preaching about the Eunuchs Wife and Children. Though I do not believe ſo ignorant a Creature was ever approved by a <hi>Presbytrey</hi> to be a Miniſter, nor hath he recited all Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi>'s words there. But I hope now that this party will not be angry if I tell them I have heard of an <hi>Antipedo-Baptiſt</hi> preacher, of a great Name among ſome of them, who, preaching, how Chriſt <hi>being rich, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Poor for our ſakes,</hi> among other things, ſaid, <hi>That he parted with his Eternity.</hi> Some call it Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: And that ſome well approved Miniſters of the <hi>Antipedobaptiſts</hi> interpret that in <hi>Luke</hi> 10.33. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Samaritan</hi> to be our Saviour, the Hoſt to be the Holy Ghoſt, the Two Pence to be Grace and Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> (if he ſpeak ſence, and it were an affront to ſay he does not) infers from <hi>Acts</hi> 20.27. <hi>That the Scripture contains a Record of all that</hi> Paul <hi>taught,</hi> that is, that <hi>all</hi> Paul<hi>'s Sermons are at large recorded in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> if he ſpeaks to the purpoſe. I think this is as bad as the Eunuchs Wife and Children; and if this be not enough, we ſhall have more before the Diſpute cloſes the firſt Queſtion. and I think this
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001635_0038_0FB3E252F768C8B0"/>may the better be remembred of Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> becauſe of what he ſays in plain words from a ſaying of Mr. <hi>Leighs, viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In pag. 36. Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> tells his Reader, <hi>That theſe Men have the confidence to affirm before ſo great an Auditory that is written in the Commiſſion that</hi> Paul <hi>did declare the Baptiſm of Infants to be a Goſpel Inſtitution.</hi> What ſhall we call this? Let the Reader view Dr. <hi>Ruſſels</hi> own Narrative, and ſee if he can find ſuch a word, or any thing more that Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will ſay it is in the Commiſſion, ALL NATIONS,</hi> which is as much to as ſay, <hi>As</hi> Paul <hi>taught all the Counſel of</hi> God, <hi>ſo he taught Infant Baptiſm, which is in the Commiſſion implyed in theſe words, ALL NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS, although there be no other account of it.</hi> I will not plead the ſufficiency of that argument; But what is this to affirming that it is written in the Commiſſion that <hi>Paul</hi> taught it? Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> can make ſuch <hi>long</hi> Conſequences on a Mans words, and ſay the Man affirmed ſo. It is ſtrange that he cannot take up with a neceſſary Conſequence, that the Commiſſion implies Infants; Yea, with the Hundredth part of the Conſequence, that there is for it, he may as well ſay Infants are expreſſed in the Commiſſion, as to ſay, that Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> thus affirmed; But he aſcribes it to them all, ſaying <hi>Theſe Men.</hi> But in Truth Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> did not ſay, <hi>it was written there,</hi> much leſs affirm it, except to ſay <hi>All Nations,</hi> be to ſay, <hi>Paul taught,</hi> &amp;c. I muſt not remark upon it!</p>
               <p>I obſerve, from one Argument to another, he has the laſt word, without being contradicted, <hi>That his Argument ſtands good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:001635_0039_0FB3E2546CFDEDD8"/>
Theſe things conſidered, with Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s granting every part of his ſecond Argument, and what he tells his Reader here, and ſome other things, do ſerve me for an eight Reaſon mentioned in my firſt Chapter.</p>
               <p>And I cannot but take Notice, how he that in his Dedication, tells, how ready he is to ſuffer for Chriſt, does joyn with it ſo much Conſcience of ſpeaking the Truth, and uſing no Fallacious Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor ſtriving for Maſtery, but only ſincerely for the Truth, without ſtriving to hide his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondents Arguments, which things the love of Chriſt obliges, ſo well as to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>His Fourth Argument, pag. 39. is, <hi>Chriſts Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion doth ſhew who are to be Baptized,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it doth not ſhew, that Infants are to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>This is a Fallacy all over, which he uſed in other words, on his firſt Argument, and I have anſwered it in the beginning of my ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>And by this Argument I can as well prove, that Dr. <hi>Ruſsel</hi> has no power to Baptize. Thus,</p>
               <p>Chriſts Commiſſion doth ſhew us who are to Baptize,</p>
               <p>But it doth not ſhew us that Dr. Ruſſel is to baptize any,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Dr. Ruſſel is not to Baptize, according to Chriſts Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>If he ſay, The Commiſſion ſhews it by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, he muſt then acknowledge his Argument a Fallacy. For if the Commiſſion ſhews it by Conſequence, it ſhews it. And let him know,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001635_0040_0FB3E255E6B03878"/>that the Commiſſion expreſſes <hi>Believers,</hi> and that the Scripture calls ſome <hi>Infants</hi> Believers; but it does not call Dr. Ruſſel a Miniſter.</p>
               <p>Now, I having already anſwered all he ſays on this Argument, need not trouble the Reader fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, only it is worth Noticing again, how ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly he preſſes for Infants to be <hi>Expreſsed,</hi> or not baptized, although he allowed, or pretended to allow of Conſequence, at firſt. And ſeeing he preſſes ſo hard for <hi>Expreſs Scripture,</hi> I Challenge him to bring Expreſs Scripture for <hi>Making Diſciples by Teaching,</hi> which is his ground Work here.</p>
               <p>Come, <hi>Doctor,</hi> You make a great Triumph, when you demand of your Reſpondents <hi>Expreſs Scripture</hi> for that which they do not pretend to prove, but by <hi>Conſequence,</hi> Where is your <hi>Expreſs Scripture</hi> that ſays, <hi>Make Diſciples by Teaching?</hi> ſeeing you pretend to have Expreſs Scripture for all you do. And where is it written, That they cannot be made any other way?</p>
               <p>If what I have ſaid be not enough, I add, If the <hi>Anti-Paedo-Baptiſts,</hi> to prove making Diſciples by Teaching, plead <hi>Mat</hi> 28.20. <hi>Teaching them, &amp;c.</hi> I will, for once, allow it; but then let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, That by the ſame Rule they are firſt to be made Diſciples by <hi>Baptizing, v.</hi> 19. And if I ſhould undertake to prove, that in Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, None are regularly Diſciples till baptized, and that all ſuch are, except by their Works they cut themſelves off again; and that to be viſibly a Diſciple, or viſibly a Church-Member, or to live under the ordinary appointed Means for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in Covenant with God, is
<pb n="33"
                      facs="unknown:001635_0041_0FB3E2576043EEF8"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>all one thing; I think they would not eaſily find it Confuted.</p>
               <p>And hence, the Faith, that in the Commiſſion, is a Qualification for Baptiſm (if believing be there named as a Qualification) is joyned with the Promiſe of Salvation; and if I affirm, that all that are viſibly Subjects of that Promiſe, and no other, are the Subjects of Baptiſm, according to the Commiſſion, I think they will not eaſily find it Confuted.</p>
               <p>I further add, If the Apoſtles had left out <hi>Infants,</hi> the <hi>Judaizing Chriſtians</hi> would have more ſtrenuouſly Oppoſed them for that, than they did for leaving out Circmuciſion, the Ceremonial Law, the yearly Feaſt-days, and Change of the Sabbath-day.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Judaizing Chriſtians</hi> did not Oppoſe them for leaving out Infants, <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did not leave out Infants.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews,</hi> who took ſuch great Satisfaction in having their Children in Covenant, with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and in their receiving the Ordinance of being received into the Covenant, would not have ſilently left out their Children, and ſet them upon equal Terms with the Children of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and make no Oppoſition.</p>
               <p>Now, from time to time, as we have the account of their Oppoſing the Apoſtles for leaving out Circumciſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of the Apoſtles vindication of their ſo doing, there is never one title of the leaving out of infants, or of the <hi>Judaizing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> pleading for their being in the Covenant, or the Apoſtles pleading againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:001635_0042_0FB3E258ED600EF0"/>
And when the ſcripture gives us the Account of the Oppoſition of theſe <hi>Judaizing Chriſtians,</hi> ſo often and full, it is not rational to think it would have been ſilent in this, which would have been the greateſt part of their Oppoſition, if Infants had not been ſtill partakers of the Sign of entring into the Church or Covenant, ſo well as formerly.</p>
               <p>The only Objection the <hi>Anti-Pedo-Baptiſts</hi> make, that has the colour of reaſon in it, is, <hi>That thus People are brought into the Church by natural Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not by Regeneration.</hi> To which <hi>I anſwer:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> the baptizing them, is an acknowledgment, that they cannot be ſaved without Regeneration; but ſuch as deny them baptiſm, have no ſuch ſign, and yet believe they are ſaved.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> It is not their natural Generation, but their being under the care of ſuch Parents or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as will bring them up under the ordinary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed means for Salvation, which entitles them to Baptiſm; for ſo was the Covenant with Father <hi>Abraham;</hi> And to be under the ordinary appointed means, is to be under a Conditional Promiſe, and ſo in Covenant, which is to be a Church-Member or Diſciple. So this Objection is falſe.</p>

               </head>
               <p>PAg. 54. <hi>I</hi> find nothing, but what is anſwered already till we come to what the Doctor helps after the Diſpute. It is his perverting that Scripture, Rom. 10.14. <hi>How ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard, &amp;c.</hi> which Text refers only to ſuch as can actually <hi>Call upon the Name of the Lord.</hi> But if this Text concerns Infants, we may as well infer, that they cannot be ſaved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they call not on the Name of the Lord, as that they cannot believe, becauſe they cannot hear with underſtanding.</p>
               <p>His next Argument, <hi>That a Miniſter muſt have an account of a perſons Faith, before he baptize him,</hi> is anſwered already. <hi>I</hi> now add, that we have no way to know an Adult Perſons Faith, but by his Profeſsion and Practice; But the Faith of Infants is known from a better Teſtimony, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Holy Scripture, as has been ſhewed.</p>
               <p>And his next following pag. 60. Of <hi>Self-denyal being neceſſary to make a Diſciple</hi> is of the ſame nature. The real deſign of that Scripture, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.27. and other like, is, to ſhew us that falſe Diſciples cannot be ſaved; altho they be viſible Diſciples they ſhall not be accepted as true Diſciples, even
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001635_0044_0FB3E25BDF64E938"/>all ſuch as will not deny themſelves for Chriſt. In the ſame ſence we read Rom. 2. leter end, <hi>That is not Circumciſion which is outward in the Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. So Rom. 9.6. <hi>They are not all</hi> Iſrael <hi>who are of</hi> Iſrael. So, if it be rational to apply this Scripture to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, the inference muſt be, That they are all Damned who dye in Infancy. <hi>Judas</hi> was a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if the Scripture ſay true, and yet this Curſe came upon him, becauſe he had not the Grace of Self-denyal, but loved the <hi>Reward of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> But how Unreaſonable is it to apply to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants the Curſes which belong only to grown Hypocrites, who for want of Self-denyal follow their Luſts, which Infants do not! That this is the deſign of ſuch Scriptures, deny if you can. And for what Reaſon muſt they be kept out of the Church, for that which will not keep them out of Heaven? Aſſign a Reaſon from Scripture he that can. And why, ſeeing they own that Infants have the bleſſing of Diſciples in their Salvation, how Unreaſonable is it to apply to them the Curſes that are intended only for Hypocrites! How theſe People underſtand the Scripture! If they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it thus in all things, it is time for all ſuch as love their Souls to be weary of them. I know they would take it very heniouſly if one ſhould ſay of them, <hi>when the blind lead the blind, both fall into the Ditch.</hi> But <hi>I</hi> hope Gods Mercy does prevail above ſome of their ignorance, for I think <hi>I</hi> know ſome good men of their Profeſsion, at leaſt of one fort of them.</p>
               <p>But <hi>I</hi> muſt obſerve, how readily they turn it off, as not to concern Infants, when ſuch Scriptures,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001635_0045_0FB3E25D6D1A3BF0"/>as, <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> is alledged for Infants Faith; but how they take all that they can pervert againſt it, although never ſo forreign to the purpoſe. <hi>I</hi> would know, by what Rule they do it, except it be that of <hi>Reſolving to ſee with but one Eye, although God has given them two?</hi> And by what Rule theſe ſcriptures concern Infants more than that?</p>
               <p>Next comes in Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> again, with his old and common Sophiſm, <hi>Denying that ever the Apoſtles baptized any Infant, demanding an Inſtance that they did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if that be a Rule, we may deny that ever they gave the Lords ſupper to <hi>Women,</hi> or Prayed, when they met on the Lords Day, to Preach, &amp;c. and many other things; for all their Acts are not Recorded; It is enough that they had Commiſſion ſo to do.</p>
               <p>But here lies the ſtrength of his fallacy, In ſtead of arguing, <hi>If they did, there is ſome account of it in ſcripture,</hi> he leaps over that to prove there is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it, and ſo might eaſily ground his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent, and blind the ignorant, and yet has proved nothing.</p>
               <p>Page. 64. Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> anſwers him well, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding an Inſtance of <hi>one born of a believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that was baptized at age.</hi> But he omitting to inſert (<hi>after Baptiſm</hi> was inſtituted) Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> p 66. takes the advantage of it, to Inſtance our Saviour; Which proves as much as to Inſtance, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> circumciſed at thirteen years old, would prove that Infants were not to be circumciſed at eight days old, when Circumciſion was not inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:001635_0046_0FB3E25EE8CA46A8"/>before he came to that age. And the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> approves it as a <hi>pertinent Anſwer,</hi> and ſo do his friends, as one of the greateſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits they had performed; and Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> is ſo pleaſed with that Opinion, as to publiſh it in his Dedication. Indeed, it will ſerve a Sophiſter very well, who has no regard to Truth nor Conſcience, but only to carry the Cauſe right or wrong.</p>
               <p>Me thinks this ſhould make Conſcientious People weary of them, I could not have believed it of them, if I had not ſeen it in their own works, ſo much admired by their Party here. If I hadbeen half perſwaded to be of their Opinion, I think ſuch things would have made me Sick of them; For if their Opinion could be true, it is as clear as the ſhining of the Sun, that they are ſatisfied in it by falſe Arguments; and I know not of one true Argument they uſe, having alſo read and well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed Mr. <hi>Keache's Rector rectified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Child may know, that neither Adult nor Infants ſhould be baptized before Baptiſm was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, be they whoſe Children they will. And <hi>I</hi> do ſay, that, till they give an Inſtance, as the Queſtion ſhould be ſtated, Mr. <hi>Leigh's</hi> Argument is as good againſt them, as theirs againſt him, and a little better, becauſe we read of ſeveral housholds baptized, though Infants be not expreſſed in them.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Ruſſel's</hi> Inſtances, p. 65, of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and others, are not ſcriptural, and therefore not to the Queſtion, neither were theſe baptized by the Apoſtles, but long after.</p>
               <p>But we muſt remember, that many Chriſtians in thoſe times had a fancy that Baptiſm cleanſed

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>them from all Sins paſt, but from none that were committed after, and therefore many inclined to have their Baptiſm deferred till juſt before their Death. And as for <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> his Father was a <hi>Pagan</hi> till <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was conſiderably grown, and being a <hi>Great Prince,</hi> and his Wife of the Nation of the <hi>Tributary Britains,</hi> it is rational to conclude, that he would not ſuffer him to be baptized in his Infancy. And moreover (if I miſtake not) <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> had a great deſire to be baptized over the ſepulchre of our Saviour, and ſo deferred it long, but how that could be done by plunging, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Next, follows Mr. <hi>Leigh's</hi> Opponency, pag. 67. where Dr. <hi>Ruſsel</hi> mannages his skill again into Sophiſtry, by not conſidering the Diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Church Members <hi>de jure, of right,</hi> and <hi>de facto, in fact.</hi> Baptized perſons, till excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, are Church-Members, and diſciples <hi>de facto.</hi> But its only ſanctified Believers (bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed or not baptized) are ſo <hi>de Jure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His anſwer to Mr. <hi>Leighs</hi> Induction, is alſo like the reſt. <hi>I</hi> paſs by his Language, though as good a Gentleman as himſelf, and obſerve his addition ſince the diſpute, when there was none to anſwer him, where he makes his Reader believe that which Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> never ſaid; For Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> denies that Infants are the <hi>Graces of the Kingdom</hi> or the <hi>Glory of the Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Heaven;</hi> and Dr. <hi>Ruſsel</hi> will ſeem to underſtand it, <hi>That they have no Interest in them;</hi> whereas a Child may know, that, <hi>to be a thing,</hi> and <hi>to have a right in a thing,</hi> are ſo far from being the ſame, that they are quite Oppoſite.

Indeed it will do to amuſe the Ignorant, and help to lead the blind Captive. <hi>I</hi> am weary of this, and ſorry that I muſt expoſe Men that profeſs Religon, to defend the Truth that ſuffers, and to defend thoſe that they unjuſtly expoſed. If I could but find fair Arguments modeſtly managed, to anſwer, it were a more grateful work. And if theſe Men that quietly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, muſt be ſo repreſented, how ſhall <hi>I</hi> eſcape, who expoſe their unfair dealing, &amp;c.? I would not do it, if I durſt omit it, for fear of the Laſh of their Tongues, eſpecially when they find that they cannot anſwer me any other way, though <hi>I</hi> encourage my ſelf, that ſuch of them as are good men, will not reproach me for my love to them; for if <hi>I</hi> could have found a way to clear the Truth from falſe arguments, without accuſing them of Sophiſtry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ſhould not have found that, nor any other word to gall them. And <hi>I</hi> comfort my ſelf, that if I ſuffer Reproach for doing that, which I am bound in Conſcience to do, it will not turn to my loſs. However, <hi>I</hi> hope that the fence of my Duty to my Maker will keep me from fearing them, ſo as to deſiſt, and I am willing to leave it to wiſe indifferent men to judge; and if I have wronged them, they ſhall have ſatisfaction.</p>

                  </hi> of Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> his Oppſiote Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I deny. For if Infants are not members of the Univerſal Church, I know not how they can be fit for Heaven when they dye.</p>

And his reply to Mr. <hi>Robinſons</hi> demand of <hi>an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Prohibition of Infants Church-memberſhip,</hi> will not do in this caſe. For, <hi>firſt,</hi> we inſiſt upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Conſequence for it, which if it be overthrown it muſt be by expreſs Scripture, or overturning our Conſequence; But the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do not pretend Scripture (that I know of) for uſing <hi>Cream</hi> and <hi>Spittle</hi> in Baptiſm. 2<hi>dly,</hi> We have expreſs Scripture that has taken Infants into the Church, and we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that they may not be turned out again, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expreſs Scripture. If the <hi>Anti-Pedo-Baptiſts</hi> have the power, we would be very glad to ſee their Commiſſion, and to know what Offence the poor Infants have committed that they muſt be caſt out of the Church, when they were Promiſed to have a right in it to all Generations.</p>
               <p>It ſeems ſtrange, that Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Scripture for turning Wicked perſons out of the Church, p. 73. but they ſay it.</p>
               <p>Pag. 74. Dr. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> unasked, acknowledges, That <hi>Infants have a Title to Grace here.</hi> I would know how this can be reconciled, with their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Faith, and which way their Grace ſhall be exerciſed without Faith? Or, if it can be in <hi>Habit</hi> only, why Faith may not alſo? But to have other Graces, and no Faith, ſeems to me like a Tree growing up and ſtanding without Roots. I think all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> call Faith the Radical Grace. How can one love, or fear, or hope in, or deſire that which he believes nothing of, &amp;c? If there be the Habit of one, I think of the other neceſſarily; But let Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> with his <hi>expreſs Scripture,</hi> ſhew, why a Root of Faith may not as well be in them
bernard villanueva
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:001635_0050_0FB3E2654322A0A8"/>as of other Graces? Yea, let him do it by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and in the mean time, I beg of him and his friends, to conſider it well and Conſcientiouſly, leſt they be found ſuch as reſiſt the evidence of Truth, againſt their own Conſcience. Or does he mean Grace after Death? No, for it is Grace <hi>here</hi> and Glory hereafter; beſide, that muſt infer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation after Death, which I cannot think he believes. Or by Grace does he mean only <hi>Temporal Comfort,</hi> ſuch Grace as the Beaſts have?</p>
               <p>He ſays, this is <hi>by Chriſts Righteouſneſs imputed</hi> to them, and when he brings Scripture to prove. that <hi>Chriſts Righteouſneſs</hi> is imputed to ſuch as have no Faith, we will bring Scripture to Baptize them. I may not enlarge to ſhew how he interprets <hi>Acts</hi> 15. (p. 75.) nor how he pleads that the <hi>Manner</hi> of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſſion was the thing there in debate, and ſays, The <hi>Manner of</hi> Moſes <hi>was to cut off the fore-ſkin,</hi> &amp;c, as if the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had uſed Circumciſſion, but in another manner, and many more ſuch things. However I will not undertake to prove infants Diſcipleſhip from <hi>that</hi> Scripture, till I can do it by a Syllogiſm, which (according to Rule) ſhall have no Fallacy in it.</p>
               <p>He ſays <hi>they</hi> (his Opponents) <hi>know, that the Churches in thoſe times conſiſted of Adult perſons.</hi> If he had ſaid, <hi>Only Adult, I</hi> would have ſaid ſomething to him. He alſo vertuoſly denys Infants, ſuch as (he ſays) have the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to them, and have a Title to <hi>Grace &amp; Glory,</hi> to be Brethren, ſo well as Believers. So they may have a Title to Glory in Heaven, and be the Brethren of our Lord and Saviour, who calls ſuch <hi>Brethren,</hi> and
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:001635_0051_0FB3E266B3D921E0"/>yet (it ſeems) not good enough to be Dr. <hi>Ruſſels</hi> Brethren.</p>
               <p>Further on, pag. 77. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> vertually denys their having received the <hi>Ho'y Ghoſt.</hi> But how this will agree with his Brother <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> who ſays, <hi>They have a Title to Grace here</hi> (Or are they cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their Title, and never have the thing) or with his own aſſertion, That <hi>Chriſts Righteouſneſs is imputed to them,</hi> and not his Spirit given, I cannot underſtand, eſpecially ſeeing the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> whom I have a greater eſteem of, ſays, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9.) <hi>If any Man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> The Greek [<hi>'Tis</hi>] <hi>any Man,</hi> is as applicable to Infants, as men. If they have Grace without the Spirit, I think it is not of Gods making, and ſo they had better be without it. However, I believe they cannot go to Heaven till they have received the Holy Spirit here in this Life, and I believe the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> underſtood himſelf very well, when he ſaid, <hi>Who can forbid Watter, that theſe may be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized who have received the Holy Goſt ſo well as we.</hi> And I pray theſe People to conſider it, and I pray God to give them a heart to do it. They have need to believe ſomething that will conſiſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Soon after, how ſincerely does Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> beg of them for an inſtance of infants Baptiſm? Poor Man! how he longed for, it when he knew they did not pretend to prove it that way. But could they have found, &amp; had the Conſcience to bring a like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to theirs, for a Child of a Believer baptized at age, <hi>I</hi> wonder if they would not have made a great cry of the Fallacy.</p>

Next follows, after a few more of Dr. <hi>Ruſſels</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks and Syllogiſms, a great bluſter about making Diſciples of Beaſts, which is about as reaſonable as many other of their arguing. For.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Infants</hi> have immortal Souls, <hi>Beaſts</hi> have not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Infants</hi> are coming on to the uſe of Reaſon, <hi>Beaſts</hi> not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we may believe <hi>Dr. Ruſſel,</hi> infants have a Title of <hi>Grace here, i. e.</hi> Grace while Infants, <hi>Beaſts</hi> have not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Infants</hi> have a fair advantage for their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the inſtruction they ſhall have meerly by vertue of their Parents Diſcipleſhip, <hi>Beaſts</hi> have not.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Lord adds to the Church ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.47. <hi>Infants</hi> are ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Beaſts</hi> are not.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Infants</hi> of believing Parents, brought under the Covenant-Promiſe, have this <hi>Promiſe</hi> as effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual a means for them, as <hi>Deligent hearing</hi> is for their Parents, who have no other Title by it but Gods promiſe, <hi>Beaſts</hi> have not.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Infants</hi> have Faith, Beaſts have not.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Infants have the Spirit of Chriſt, elſe they are none of his, <hi>Beaſts</hi> have not.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Infants</hi> have Chriſts Righteouſneſs imputed to them, which I think infers that he owns them for Diſciples, but Beaſts have not.</p>

For though I acknowledge grown Diſciples are made and edified by Teaching, and not without, yet I deny that the Commiſſion for Baptiſm obliges only ſuch to be baptized who are ſo made, as I have ſufficiently ſhown; and his Argument is wholly a <hi>begging of a Principle:</hi> And ſo long as our Saviour owns them for Diſciples, I am not ſo much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how Dr. <hi>Ruſ</hi> accounts them; But I deſire him to ſhew me the Rule by which our Saviour has requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Baptiſm of ſome Diſciples, and not others.</p>

               <p>Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> in one of his Remarks, made after the Diſpute, the better to help his cauſe, pag. 79 does give infants Baptiſm a title of <hi>an unſcriptural Practice, not to call it worſe;</hi> which indeed were enough to fright a perſon of a tender Conſcience.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed</hi> alſo, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>i. e.</hi> it was to remain, when Circumciſion is aboliſhed. <hi>Abraham</hi> was to be <hi>Heir of the World,</hi> v.13. The Uncircumciſed <hi>Gentile Church,</hi> and not the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> only, were to come into his Covenant; Yea, it is expreſs, <hi>v.</hi>16. <hi>Therefore it is of Faith, that it might be by Grace, to the end the Promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed, not to that only which is of the Law, but to that alſo which is of the Faith of</hi> Abraham, <hi>who is the Father of us all,</hi> Thus it was a Goſpel Covenant, to remain for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And becauſe we are brought into it, he is called, <hi>The Father of us all,</hi> not our ſpiritual Father, except he were the Inſtrument of our Converſion, but the Man with whom a formal Covenant was made, not only for himſelf, but for all that ſhould
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001635_0056_0FB3E27030C3E300"/>come into it; and this Covenant includes the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanter</hi> and his ſeed, and it contains the whole Goſpel of Salvation by Faith in Chriſt, who was promiſed in it. Now this Covenant was a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Faith</hi> with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Infant ſeed included in it, had no more Faith than ours have. His ſeed that lived to grow up might looſe the Bleſſings of it by tranſgresſing the Conditions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had obtained the covenanted ſaving Grace, and ſo may ours, and ſo may an Adult per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, received in by Diſcipleſhip, but not yet fully regenerate. Now this Covenant being the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the viſible Goſpel Church, all that are included in it, are Church Members and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Now that which was legal, as Circumciſion, is expreſsly repealed, but the ſame Covenant is ſtill of as good force after <hi>that</hi> is repealed. This covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>not</hi> repealed in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> time, and we believe it never was ſince. If the [<hi>Antipedobapsiſts</hi>] ſay, it is, they would do well to ſhew it, for they have not done it yet. And if they ſay, Infants are alſo taken out of it, let them produce Scripture for it, and it will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and they, who plead ſo hard for <hi>Expreſs Scripture, I</hi> think, are obliged to do it, or yield. And in the mean time, we believe, that if Infants, or Children, or Seed, were never once mentioned in the New Teſtament, they have as good a Title as they had in <hi>Abrahams</hi> days, to all the Signs of the Covenant of Grace, and that it belongs not to us to prove them a New to be in the Covenant, whom we find once in the Covenant now in being, but that it belongs to ſuch as deny it to prove them
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:001635_0057_0FB3E272252F41B0"/>turned out. And we think that to be ſo far beyond any warrant they can find in Sripture, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Infants or Children, on the account of their Parents, are expreſsly included ſtill, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.29. And that this Covenant or promiſe is the ground for Baptiſm. <hi>v.</hi> 28. Hence I argue,</p>
               <p>If being in the Covenant, be the Ground for Baptiſm, then all in the Covenant ought to be baptized,</p>
               <p>But being in the Covenant, is the Ground for Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> All in the Covenant ought to be baptized.</p>
               <p>And now, Dr. <hi>Ruſsel,</hi> for your <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſcriptural Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> which you ſo vaunt with, If any ſtill deny Infants being included in the Promiſe, contrary to Scripture, I would know of them, by what War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant they believe GOD will do that which he has never promiſed? Or elſe <hi>I</hi> ſhall believe it an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural Practice in Dr. <hi>Ruſsel</hi> to believe ſo uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably of Infants; They may be every ſoul of them damned, for any thing he knows, if they are not included in the promiſe; <hi>Ay, but he has proved by Scripture, that they have a right to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory in Heaven,</hi> ſee pag. 69. Very well, They are not in the Kingdom of Glory yet, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore it muſt be a Promiſe, and I know of no Goſpel Promiſe but what is either Abſolutely or Conditionally, and either mediately or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the Promiſe of eternal Life; and <hi>I</hi> know of no ſuch Promiſes to any of the Children of Men, but what are Goſpel promiſes; and I know no diſtinction in ſuch revealed Promiſes, with reſpect to Baptiſm.</p>

               <p>But nothing without the Promiſe is a Rule for Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Promiſe is our Rule to know whom to baptize.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diſcipleſhip, Faith, Repentance,</hi> and the <hi>Profesſion of Faith,</hi> are to the Miniſters only Rules to know who are under the Promiſe, and thereby Rules for Baptiſm. So any other Mark of being under the promiſe, as to be the Child of a believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, is a Rule for Baptiſm. I wonder what good Diſcipleſhip or Faith would do us, in order to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, if neither abſolute nor conditional Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were annexed, and therefore are they expreſſed in the Commisſion. I conclude, that when an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Eunuchs Faith were demanded, it was to know whether he had an Intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Promiſe; For other Marks are required in the Adult, than in infants. I argue <hi>a pari,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Promiſe be our Rule to know whom to baptize, then infants under the Promiſe, ſo well as their Parents, are to be baptized, ſo well as the Parents.</p>
               <p>But the Promiſe is our Rule to know whom to Baptize,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> infants under the Promiſe, ſo well as their Parents, are to be baptized ſo well as their Parents.</p>
               <p>The Adult have no other Title to it but the Promiſe, and if Dr <hi>Ruſsel</hi> ſay true, that Infants have a right to the Kingdom of Glory before they are in it, they have their <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>Again, I argue,</p>
               <p>If Baptiſm ſignify that which Circumciſion did (<hi>viz.</hi> an Entrance into the Church) then Baptiſm is (in that) come in the room of Circumciſion.

               <p>Whence I argue,</p>
               <p>If Baptiſm be come in the room of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, then all that were to be Circumciſed, are to be baptized, except ſome new order to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is come in the room of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and no new order to prohibit any, but to add the Females.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> All that were to be circumciſed, are to be baptized, and the Females added.</p>

               <p>Only that Baptiſm which repreſents every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith, is the right Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>But the Baptiſm only of Infants, ſo well as Adult, repreſents every Article of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Baptiſm only of Infants, ſo well as Adult, is the light Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Again,</p>
               <p>That Baptiſm which repreſents only ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith, is not the right Baptiſm.</p>

               <p>Now, I dare Challenge any one to name one

Again, If Baptiſm belcome in the room of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, then the Threatnings to the neglect of Circumciſion are to be applyed to the neglect of Baptiſm, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now the Uncircumciſed Child was threatned with ſomething like damnation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.14 He was to be <hi>Cut off from his People.</hi> Make the leaſt of it, it was to be cut off from the Covenant Promiſe, and ſo is out of the Church, and the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment promiſes no Salvation to the Unbaptized, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. Therefore let theſe People allow their Infants the Covenant-ſign, or lay aſide their confidence of their Salvation, when they dye in Infancy; For they have no promiſe of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it is but gueſs-work, as appears, thus, If they are in Covenant, they are in the Church, and the ſign belongs to them; But if there be no Covenant, there is no Promiſe belonging to them. And I think it is a ſinful Preſumption, to believe and rely upon that which God has not promiſed, eſpecially when we thereby neglect that which he has annexed his Promiſe unto.</p>
               <p>They ask expreſs Scripture, <hi>Baptize Infants;</hi> But there is no expreſs Scripture, <hi>Baptize Grown Perſons,</hi> or <hi>give the Lords Supper to Women,</hi> or the like. But <hi>I</hi> think <hi>I</hi> have made appear, that there is in all things the ſame Rule for the one as the other. <hi>I</hi> might add much more, but I think it is needleſs, except there ſhould need a few expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to ſtop the Mouth of <hi>Momus</hi> but that may be beſt done when <hi>Momus</hi> has acted his part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NB.</hi> Some of theſe Argumental have occaſionally
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:001635_0062_0FB3E27AAE409380"/>uſed before and proved them, I therefore only here name them in order, leſt the Reader over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look them in reading the former; ſome are New, and ſome I have uſed ſeveral times upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers occaſions, and to conclude ſeveral Arguments.</p>
               <p>Now if I have committed any Fallacy in all that I have done, it is more than I know of, and <hi>I</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that ſuch as do it knowingly, in things that concern the Worſhip of God and Mens immortal Souls, are the worſt of men, and next to Devils.</p>
               <p>In ſome leſſer Arguments, that were not bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I</hi> have not taken ſo much pains to find out, if there were any Fallacy in them, as <hi>I</hi> have done in the greater, ſuch as ſurely carry the Cauſe, if they be true; But if any Fallacy be found in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or leſſer Arguments, I will retract them.</p>
               <p>Perhaps our Oppoſers will object, That I have committed their Fault in applying ſome ſcriptures to Infants, which do not belong to them, &amp;c. To which I ſay, I hope it will not be ſuch ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as expreſs them, nor ſuch as mean the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of Mankind, nor ſuch as are as applicable to Infants as to grown Perſons, if they have the pollution of Original ſin; and if they find any other, and can give as good a Reaſon againſt its concerning Infants, as I gave againſt thoſe they bring and apply to infants, I will retract its Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to what is ſaid, I deſire the Reader to uſe this point of good Conſideration, that if he find one Argument in the Book that is undeniably binding, to know that that Argument does carry it, although all the reſt were nothing worth, and that he again pray God for wiſdom.</p>

A Word on this firſt Queſtion.</p>
               <p>I do not undertake to tell the reaſon why ſuch as wickedly give themſelves up to the Devil to ſerve him, can never finiſh their Covenant with him, till they Renounce their Baptiſm (which for the moſt part was performed by ſprinkling in their Infancy) But we may remember, that Baptiſm is the ſigning of our Covenant which GOD has made with us.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>WHether the Ordinance of Baptiſm, as appointed by Chriſt, is to be adminiſtred by Dipping, Plunging or Overwhelming only, and not otherwiſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Ruſſel takes it in the Affirmative. His firſt Argument is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Holy Scripture ſhews us the right way of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it doth not ſhew us that it ought to be done by ſprinkling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ergo, <hi>Sprinkling is not the right way of Baptizing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I deny his <hi>Minor,</hi> and ſhall anon prove the contrary. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the ſame argument I can prove that <hi>Plunging</hi> is not the right way; for the Scripture doth not ſhew us that is ought to be done ſo, as <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſhew.</p>
               <p>His next Argument is, That <hi>Sprinkling does
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:001635_0064_0FB3E27DB8DD28D0"/>ſignify that which ought to be repreſented in Baptiſm,</hi> &amp;c. which I alſo deny, and ſhall prove the contrary; and I ſay, and ſhall prove the ſame of <hi>Plunging.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To prove this, he undertakes to ſhew from <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. and <hi>Col</hi> 2.12. <hi>That Baptiſm repreſents the Burial and Reſurrection of our Saviour, and ours by him,</hi> which if true, does not prove his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, except it repreſent nothing elſe, if it do then. But the deſign of theſe Scriptures is only to preſs to a <hi>Holy Life,</hi> and one Argument is taken from Baptiſm, becauſe that it is an obligation to a holy Life, which is called <hi>a dying to Sin</hi> and a being <hi>crucified to the World,</hi> Gal. 6.14, &amp;c. But if he will have the manner of Baptiſm repreſent Chriſt's Death or Burial, becauſe it obliges to Duties of Mortification that reſemble it, and are the effect of it, he would do well to bring ſome clearer Scripture for it. But if his Argument be true, our Baptiſm muſt reſemble more, for it is ſaid <hi>Ro.</hi> 6.3. <hi>are Baptized into his Death.</hi> Now that was by hanging on the Croſs and ſheding his blood; Therefore Baptiſm muſt alſo reſemble that; But if the manner of Baptiſm muſt anſwer the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, the truth is, it ſignifies the waſhing away of Sin by the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. <hi>Ariſe and be Baptized,</hi> and waſh away thy Sins. 1 Joh. 1.7. <hi>And the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all Sin.</hi> Now the way which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the application of the Blood of Chriſt, Is ſprinkling, 1 Pet. 1.2. <hi>Through Sanctification of the Spirit unto Obedience, and ſprinkling of the Blood of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Baptiſm repreſents and is an engagement
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:001635_0065_0FB3E27F29E0AC30"/>to the anſwer of a good Conſcience 1 Pet. 3.21. <hi>The like Figure whereunto even baptiſm doth now ſave us, not the puting away the filth of the fleſh, but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of a good Conſcience,</hi> &amp;c. Now this is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by ſprinkling. Heb. 10.22. <hi>Having our Hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience.</hi> Now if the next words, <hi>And your Bodies waſhed with pure Water,</hi> ſignify the ſame with the former, then the waſhing thereis Sprinkling, which doubtleſs it is; but if it be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is not that which repreſents cleanſing the Conſcience, and therefore is not Baptiſm. But Baptiſm ſignifies Cleanſing the Conſcience, and that is done by ſprinkling. Now this ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Baptiſm and Sprinkling I have from expreſs Scripture.</p>
               <p>But where is his ſignification of Plunging from expreſs Scripture, which they ſo much boaſt of? Therefore I muſt turn upon Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> a little of that which he lays ſo confidently upon others, with Triumph.</p>
               <p>The way which doth not ſignifie that which ought to be repreſented in Baptiſm, according to Chriſts appointment, is not the right way of baptizing.</p>
               <p>But Plunging doth not ſignify that which ought to be repreſented in Baptiſm, according to Chriſts appointment.</p>
               <p>Ergo, Plunging is not the right way of Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.</p>
               <p>The Major is Dr. <hi>Ruſſels</hi> own. The Minor they will deny; Therefore I muſt uſe his own Argument.</p>
               <p>If plunging do ſignify that which ought to be

               <p>But it is nowhere ſo recorded in Holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Plunging doth not ſignify that which ought to be repreſented in baptiſm according to Chriſts appointment.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is his own Argument, and the <hi>Minor</hi> I muſt prove by his Argument.</p>
               <p>If it be any where ſo recorded in Holy Scripture, Dr. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> or ſome other perſon, is able to ſhew it.</p>
               <p>But neither Dr <hi>Ruſſel</hi> nor any other perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is able to ſhew it,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is no where ſo recorded.</p>
               <p>Now if they cannot ſhew us by Scripture that Chriſt has appointed <hi>Plunging</hi> to ſignify that which ought to be repreſented in Baptiſm, they muſt not blame us if we, after their Example, accuſe them of an <hi>Unſcriptural Practice, not to call it worſe, viz.</hi> a ſuperſtitious binding that which God has not bound, or laying a Command on Men in Gods Worſhip, which God has not commanded.</p>
               <p>I have produced <hi>expreſs ſcripture,</hi> that ſprinkling does ſignify the Application of the Blood of Chriſt, and cleanſing from an evil Conſcience, and that theſe ought to be repreſented in Baptiſm; But they, without any true Conſequence, much leſs expreſs ſcripture, ſay, that <hi>Plunging</hi> repreſents a Burial, and that <hi>that</hi> ought to be repreſented in Baptiſm. However <hi>I</hi> will not contend about the latter, let Baptiſm repreſent a Burial, The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of burying is by throwing the Earth on
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:001635_0067_0FB3E282316C4860"/>to the Body, And hereafter we ſhall hear how it repreſents a Reſurrection alſo.</p>
               <p>Having tryed <hi>Plunging</hi> by ſome of Dr. <hi>Ruſſels</hi> Arguments, I proceed to try Sprinkling by the ſame Rule, and ſay,</p>
               <p>The way which doth ſignify that which ought to be repreſented in Baptiſm, according to Chriſts appointment, is the right way of baptizing.</p>
               <p>But <hi>ſprinkling</hi> doth ſignify that which ought to be repreſented in Baptiſm, according to Chriſts appointment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Sprinkling is the right way of Baptizing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is his own; the <hi>Minor</hi> I have proved by expreſs Scripture.</p>
               <p>Now by the ſame Rule, I ſay, That manner which ſignifies Cleanſing from ſin, muſt be uſed in Baptiſm. But ſprinkling is that manner which ſignifies Cleanſing from ſin, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Sprinkling muſt be uſed in Baptiſm. Again,</p>
               <p>That which is a ſufficient ſign of cleanſing from ſin, is a ſufficient ſign to be uſed in Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>But ſprinkling is a ſufficient ſign of cleanſing from ſin, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36, 25. <hi>Then will I ſprinkle Clean Water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ergo</hi> Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is a ſufficient ſign to be uſed in Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Now that <hi>Plunging</hi> does <hi>Not</hi> ſignify that which ought to be repreſented in Baptiſm, appears thus,</p>
               <p>The principal thing repreſented in Baptiſm is our cleanſing from ſin by the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But the Blood of Chriſt was not a River or Pond great enough to cover a Man, but ſome ſtreams, enough to ſprinkle with; and this agrees with ſcripture, which never deſcribes our cleanſing from
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:001635_0068_0FB3E283A94E9D90"/>ſin by any other Figure than <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> that I remember.</p>
               <p>Again, Baptiſm repreſents the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.8. This is expreſſed by <hi>Pouring,</hi> and not by plunging, that ever I remember. See Iſai. 44.3. <hi>And I will pour my Spirit upon thy ſeed,</hi> &amp;c. See alſo <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28.</p>
               <p>Thus name what Repreſentation in Baptiſm you will, and <hi>ſprinkling</hi> ſignifies it, As, <hi>ſanct fication,</hi> the <hi>Gift</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt, Cleanſing from ſin</hi> or <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> a <hi>good Conſcience</hi> or <hi>holy Life,</hi> the <hi>Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Blood of Chriſt,</hi> The <hi>Death of Chriſt,</hi> (by the ſign of <hi>Sprinkling</hi> his Blood) a <hi>Burial,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>Body.</hi> But where is the ſcripture that <hi>Plunging</hi> ſignifies any one of theſe things, but moſt of them are expreſſed of <hi>Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> or <hi>Pouring,</hi> which is much the ſame. Hence the Blood of Chriſt where-with we are cleanſed, is called <hi>The Blood of Sprinkling,</hi> Hebr. 12, 14.</p>
               <p>So when the Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, it was ſaid, <hi>ſo ſhall he Sprinkle many Nations,</hi> Iſa. 52, 15. which muſt needs allude to ſomething, and what more properly than their <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> at their Converſion, which was the Token of it.</p>
               <p>And now, where is Dr. <hi>Ruſſels</hi> Argument, that <hi>Rhantiſma</hi> is never uſed where the Ordinance of Baptiſm is ſpoken of? Now let them, if they can, produce any ſcripture that ſays, <hi>I will Plunge them in clean Water, and they ſhall be clean;</hi> Or of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Gentiles. <hi>So ſhall he Plunge many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> Or <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſays, <hi>Planged from an evil Conſcience;</hi> or calls the Blood of Chriſt <hi>The Blood of Plunging,</hi> or any thing equivolent to theſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="unknown:001635_0069_0FB3E2852AC226D8"/>
His next Argument is, <hi>That there is no account in ſcripture that ever the Apoſtles, or any other Miniſters in thoſe times and baptize any other way than by dipping,</hi> p. 89. Whereas by the ſame Medium, <hi>I</hi> can as well prove <hi>Sprinkling</hi> to be the only right way, and ſay, there is no account that ever they bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed any other way than by <hi>Springling.</hi> And till they produce an Inſtance of another way, my Argument is as good as his.</p>
               <p>But they ſuppoſe they have plentiful proof for Dipping, of which we ſhall hear more anon.</p>
               <p>The next Debate is upon the Etymology of the word <hi>Baptizo,</hi> p. 90. It is derived from <hi>Bapto</hi> which ſignifies <hi>To Dip.</hi> Now <hi>Baptizo</hi> being alſo a Verb, ſo well as <hi>Bapto,</hi> and being derived from it, muſt according to the ordinary and uſual way have ſome difference of ſignification; and there is no better way to know what it is, than by ſeeing in what ſenſe it is uſed in the New Teſtament, where the Ordinance of Baptiſm is not ſpoken of, to know how to underſtand it where the Ordinance is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mark.</hi> 7. We read of the Phariſees who <hi>waſh their hands before they eat,</hi> verſ. 4. <hi>When they come from the Market, except they waſh, they do not eat.</hi> In the Greek Original it is [<hi>ei me Baptizontai</hi>] <hi>Except they are Baptized,</hi> which was but the waſhing of their hands, Then follows the <hi>Waſhing of Cups and Pots and brazen Veſſels, and Tables.</hi> In the Greek it is [<hi>Baptiſmous</hi>] the <hi>Baptiſms</hi> of Cups, &amp;c. Now Tho ſmaller things they might eaſily <hi>Dip</hi> all over, but I conceive that in a Country where there was but little Water, ſew had convenience to dip their
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:001635_0070_0FB3E286ABF33880"/>Tables all over under water. Luke 11.38. <hi>The Phariſees marvelled that</hi> (our Saviour) <hi>had not firſt Waſhed before dinner;</hi> In the Greek it is [<hi>e baptiſthe</hi>] that he was not <hi>Baptized.</hi> Again, Heb. 9, 10. <hi>divers Waſhings;</hi> in the Greek it is <hi>divers Baptiſms;</hi> but thoſe Baptiſms (as after deſcribed) were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Sprinklings.</hi> Hence <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> are words ſo near of like ſignification, that they are uſed for the ſame thing. Now let them, if they can, produce one place where <hi>Baptizo,</hi> or its derivatives, are uſed for <hi>Dipping</hi> or <hi>Plunging. Bapto</hi> indeed is often uſed for <hi>Lipping,</hi> and I think in no other ſenſe; but <hi>Baptizo</hi> is another word. It matters not ſo much how it is uſed in Authors, becauſe ſeveral places and ſeveral Ages apply the ſame word to divers Uſes, as may be ſeen in the ſeveral ſhires in <hi>England,</hi> (not to look into other Countries or Tongues) as I can perceive by ſuch as come from thence; Therefore the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Dialect is the only beſt Rule, and there we find that on all other occaſions <hi>Baptizo</hi> ſignifies either Waſhing or Sprinkling, and not Dipping.</p>
               <p>He next argues upon the Prepoſition [<hi>into</hi>] in the Greek [<hi>eis</hi>] and ſays, that <hi>when it is joyned with an Accuſative it ſignifies Into,</hi> which is not a Rule, and therefore not ſufficient to rely ones Faith upon. Matth. 18.15, <hi>[ean amarteſe eis ſe Ad<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:001635_0071_0FB3E2894F8AF930"/>I might add a multitude of Examples. So it is not certain that <hi>Phillip</hi> and the Eunuch went more than <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto</hi> the water. John 12, 17. [eis ten he meran] <hi>Againſt the day,</hi> Not <hi>Into</hi> it, for ſhe ſpent her Oyntment before the day came. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26, 10. [eis eme] <hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon,</hi> as when the Tempter took our Saviour up <hi>Into</hi> an high Mountain, it was but <hi>On to</hi> it, otherwiſe he could not have ſhewed him much. So the Particle <hi>[eis]</hi> cannot help them, nor can <hi>Into the Water</hi> (as it is tranſlated.) They alſo plead the coming <hi>Out</hi> of the Water, which will help them no more. Our Saviour came [apo tou hudatos] <hi>From the Water,</hi> is the true Translation, if <hi>Matth.</hi> 19, 8. [ap' archis] <hi>From the beginning,</hi> be true, and many more ſuch, as Matt. 1.17, &amp;c. All with a Genitive, The Eunuch came <hi>[ec tou hudatos]</hi> and the ſame alſo with a Genitive. Matth. 19.20. [ecneotetos meu] <hi>From my Mouth,</hi> &amp;c. I need not add; But ſee how they build their ſeparation from other Chriſtians on a falſe Foundation.</p>
               <p>He brings the opinion of a multitude of Authors, which ſtill is no Proof, if his Quotations be never ſo true; and tho they all had baptized by Dipping or Plunging.</p>
               <p>We read <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.17. of ſitting under <hi>Booths,</hi> which was commanded in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but had not been done ſince the days of <hi>Joſhua</hi> the Son of <hi>Nun.</hi> Now if ſo many good Men, wiſe Men, and Kings and Prophets, ſuch as <hi>David, Solomon,</hi> &amp;c. did not ſee to amend this, it is no wonder now, if
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:001635_0072_0FB3E28A744D6F50"/>ſo many miſs the ſignification of the word <hi>Baptizo,</hi> and take the Original ſignification in ſtead of that which was in uſe by the Apoſtles; and if they fall into a miſtake, becauſe we read ſometimes of their going down <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Water,</hi> &amp;c. to Baptize, when they were in the woods, and had no other way.</p>
               <p>In the next place he pleads from the places of <hi>Much Water</hi> ſpoken of, as <hi>Enon,</hi> which in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſignifies <hi>Springs,</hi> and Travellers tell us, it is only a place of <hi>Many Springs,</hi> but no place for plunging, and I think they would not have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cold ſpring Water for that uſe; and the <hi>Greek</hi> word is <hi>Many Waters,</hi> which agrees with this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; and it was therefore a convenient place that People might alſo have Water to drink.</p>
               <p>His next Argument is from <hi>Acts</hi> 8.38. of Phillip <hi>and the</hi> Eunuch <hi>going down Into the Water.</hi> But does it ſay that he plunged or dipped him all over there? for the word <hi>Baptized</hi> does not prove that, as we have ſeen; nor is it certain that they went more than <hi>to</hi> the Water, ſo far as to dip a handful, as has been evidenced; nay, if they went but half way over Shoes, they went into the water. But he ſays, <hi>they could have ſent for a little Water,</hi> But how does he know they had any empty veſſel?</p>
               <p>And what is the reaſon, (when we read of ſo many Perſons, baptiſed in Houſes and Cities) that there is never any mention of their going <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto</hi> nor <hi>into</hi> that Water, but only in the woods (as <hi>John</hi>) and on the Road, as <hi>Phillip</hi> with the Eunuch.</p>
               <p>Alſo, we read <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47. <hi>Who can forbid Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi> which has as fair a ſhow for its being brought, as going <hi>to</hi> the water, (when they had no other
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:001635_0073_0FB3E28BEBD129C0"/>way to get it) has of their Plunging, and <hi>I</hi> think a little fairer.</p>
               <p>And the baptizing in <hi>Jordan,</hi> does no more Prove their <hi>Plunging</hi> all over in it, than the man wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing his Eyes in the Pool of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>loam</hi> does prove that he was plunged all over, ſeeing <hi>[baptizo]</hi> proves no more but <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> and <hi>[eis]</hi> is ſo well uſed there as in the other.</p>
               <p>Thus it appears, their Arguments from the word <hi>Baptizo,</hi> and from going <hi>to</hi> or <hi>Into,</hi> and <hi>Out</hi> of or <hi>From</hi> the Water, and of baptizing <hi>in Jordan,</hi> and where there was <hi>Much Water,</hi> carry no Proof in them, and are but Probabilities at the beſt; and ſo is <hi>en hudati,</hi> ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. <hi>[en huio,] by his Son.</hi> And theſe are all the Proofs they have; For their Arguments from what ſhould be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in baptiſm, are wholly for us; for we have plentiful Expreſs-Scripture that <hi>Sprinkling</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies every thing that the ſcripture ſpeaks of as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in Baptiſm, but there is no ſcripture that ſpeaks of <hi>Dipping,</hi> as ſignifying any ſuch thing; And <hi>I</hi> hope, they will own, that it belongs to God, and not to Man, to appoint what ſign ſhall repreſent the thing ſignifyed.</p>
               <p>Come now Dr. <hi>Ruſsel,</hi> Who are guilty of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural Practice? Under the Ceremonial Law Typical Ordinances were commanded, in what manner they were to be uſed, unto a <hi>Circumſtance;</hi> but under the Goſpel Adminiſtration, the <hi>ſpiritual Improvement</hi> is principally looked upon. Baptiſm muſt be with <hi>Water,</hi> but it is not ſaid <hi>How;</hi> and I believe, if it had been tyed to any ſet Form, it had been written in the Scripture; Therefore let
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:001635_0074_0FB3E28D67D34C18"/>us not <hi>Bind</hi> what God has left Unbound; but if the ſcripture have given us any Rule for the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it muſt be <hi>Sprinkling;</hi> And it is moſt evident from ſcripture (as has been ſhown) that <hi>Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> is fully ſufficient, and has the Promiſe annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that Sign, <hi>And they ſhall be Clean,</hi> but no ſuch promiſe annexed to Plunging.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, it muſt be none of the ſmalleſt of thoſe Sins, that are committed under the colour of Gods Worſhip, when People deny the Baptiſm which they have received according to Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, by receiving another.</p>
               <p>But God does not always ſhew viſible ſigns of his diſpleaſure at evil Actions and profaning his Ordinances, ſeeing we have the ſcripture to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie.</p>
               <p>I find the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> (for they are worthily ſo called) often Challenge People to give an Inſtance of any one that ever got any harm by being plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in cold Water, as if it were rational to expect that GOD had commanded a Duty, and that only in matter of ſacrifice, which did many times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a Miracle to preſerve us above the ordinary courſe of Nature in performing it; Though I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it would be preſumption for a perſon to run himſelf into imminent danger, under this imagination, if not a breach of the ſixth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and a Tempting of God. Yet I know not but God may in his Mercy forgive the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and accept the Zeal of ſome, and not let them ſuffer for it, eſpecially ſuch as have not been baptized before, whoſe duty it is to be baptized ſome
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:001635_0075_0FB3E28EF18D93D0"/>way; And I think, that People are ſo begotted to their Error, that if ſome get cold and dye of it, they would not believe that to be the cauſe.</p>
               <p>But to anſwer that challenge, I can tell them of a more awful thing than getting Cold. I will not relate it as a thing of my own knowledge, for it was done before I was born, or not long after; but ſuch as would be ſatisfied, may enquire at <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> where dwelt one <hi>Betts,</hi> a Member of the Congregational Church there, who turned <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> and was dipped, and (as I am told) came out of the water <hi>diſtracted,</hi> and ſo remained; And his Children whom he, by this, did what was in him to throw out of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came alſo Diſtracted: Two of his Sons I have ſeen, who are both Diſtracted Men; but his Grand Children are as other People; they all live now far from that place, and are as far from that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who have ſo much reaſon as to know of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. The Concluſion.</head>
               <p>I Adviſe the Reader, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Do not put away all Charity toward ſuch as differ from you in this Doctrine, Provided you ſee in them the other Marks of the Fear of GOD; for great Faults in things not eſſentially neceſſary to ſalvation, when they proceed from meer Ignorance, do not hinder the ſalvation of ſuch as are in the eſſential part ſound and ſincere, and therefore ought not to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our love to them, for his ſake that accepts and loves them, and forgives their Ignorance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> Do not think your ſalvation ſecure, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe you are ſatisfied, that you are purely right in this Doctrine; for Baptiſm, not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, will do you no more good than knowledge not improved.</p>
               <p>To help you herein, conſider That the <hi>Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal words</hi> repreſent the <hi>Faith of the Holy Trinity.</hi> Improve it in the ſaving knowledge of God our Maker, Redeemer, and Sanctifyer, and perform your Engagements to him, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Application of <hi>Clean Water</hi> implies a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:001635_0078_0FB3E2942AF5A288"/>that we are <hi>Polinted by Sin;</hi> For that which is clean, needs no Waſhing. Therefore be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and penitent, and judge and condemn your ſelf from the ſenſe of it, and ſo find your need of a Saviour, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Water applyed,</hi> repreſents, That our help comes from without our ſelves, namely, by the Blood of Chriſt that takes away our Guilt, and procures Pardon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by his ſpirit that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it in our Sanctification. There ſeek it.</p>
               <p>Again, the <hi>Water, applyed by the hands of another,</hi> (who is Gods Officer) implies, That it is not in our own power to apply theſe things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeek to him that can do it.</p>
               <p>There being alſo <hi>Our Act</hi> in receiving Baptiſm on our ſelves or Children, implies, That we are not to expect the Bleſſings repreſented in Baptiſm, as Promiſes to us, except we be found ſeeking in Gods appointed way, as his Word, Meditations, Prayer, Practice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again the <hi>Applying Clean Water,</hi> implies our Obligations and Engagements to a holy Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which cannot be without ſelf-denyal.</p>
               <p>And in the Baptiſmal words, <hi>Gods Name being put upon us,</hi> implies. That we are <hi>wholly his,</hi> and devoted to give up our ſelves to ſerve <hi>Him Only</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and deny all that is againſt him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our bodies</hi> being the part that the Elementary part is applyed to, repreſents the <hi>Reſurrection of the Body</hi> to enjoy theſe bleſſings.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of the Chief things repreſented in our Baptiſms; ſo improve it, and it will be your happineſs, otherwiſe it is a Mockery, and taking Gods Name in vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:001635_0079_0FB3E295A6F81EB8"/>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> I adviſe ſuch as have not been baptized, or have not got their Children baptized, not to delay it, leſt the Curſe written, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.14. come upon them; Nor to delay performing that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as our Duty in Baptiſm, that they may have the Grace repreſented in it; Otherwiſe the ſame Curſe will nevertheleſs come upon them; <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.25, 26.</p>
               <p>I am not of their mind, who would have the Unbaptized deprived of any of the Priviledges common to Mankind, to force them; for Chriſt, our Redeemer, needs no forced ſubjects. It were a diſhonour to think he did, or that his Grace were not lovely enough it ſelf for a Motive; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they come to him in Truth, who come againſt their will; and to adminiſter his Ordinance to ſuch, were greatly to profane it, and take Gods Name in vain; <hi>I</hi> mean, to ſuch as are come of Age to chuſe, and in their heart do refuſe.</p>
               <p>But <hi>I</hi> would have no other force or motive uſed than Gods Word. For though Baptiſm is not ſo eſſentially Neceſſary, but that he, that has not the opportunity, may be ſaved without it, if he have the Grace repreſented, yet it is not ſo with him that knows his duty, and has the Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and will not do it; For any wilful ſin, though never ſo ſmall, perſiſted in, brings Damnation, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10. becauſe it is not want of Ability, but willful Rebellion. Hence ſalvation is promiſed to him <hi>that believes and is Baptized,</hi> but not to the Unbaptized, to him it is ſilent. And when ſome <hi>were pricked to the heart, and cryed, What ſhall we do?</hi> The reply was, <hi>Repent, and be Baptized,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:001635_0080_0FB3E2972D833AD8"/>Acts</hi> 2.37, 38. and upon that condition the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> was promiſed.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4thly,</hi> Let ſuch, as have got their Children baptized, remember, you have in a moſt ſolemn manner declared them to be Diſciples. Now, how came they to be Diſciples, but by being the Children of one who will ſurely <hi>Teach them aili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,</hi> and ſet them all Examples of Piety. They are not Diſciples by being under your care, if you do not do it ſo ſoon as they are capable. Now you have declared to God and his Church, That they are ſuch, and that in a ſolemn manner, by having Gods ſacred <hi>Name</hi> named over them, as his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples; ſo that, if you neglect, you are guilty in a high degree of <hi>Lying unto God,</hi> and of taking his holy Name in vain! beſide many more evils. Oh tremble to think upon it! Therefore Teach, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, and Pray for them, till you ſee the bleſſings of Diſcipleſhip in them.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5thly,</hi> I adviſe the Reader, that, if he ſee ground of Conviction by this Doctrinal, or this latter Practical Diſcourſe on Baptiſm, that he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, It is GOD, and not Man, <hi>with whom we have to do!</hi> Take heed, leſt ye <hi>Reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> in refuſing the evidence of Truth. It will not help you in the Day of Judgment, that you have been wont to believe or practiſe otherwiſe; for if <hi>GOD wincked at your Ignorance</hi> before, <hi>now he calls you to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> and you have <hi>no Excuſe</hi> for the time to come. Therefore think upon it, as you expect to appear before the <hi>Judge of Quick and Dead.</hi>

            <head>The Summ of the Matter.</head>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> propoſes a good Rule page 50. where he ſays, He <hi>had rather walk</hi> exactly <hi>by the Commiſſion than by ſuch Conſequences wherein he may be deceived.</hi> Now the Commiſſion <hi>expreſſes</hi> Believers, and our ſaviour calls ſome Infants <hi>Believers;</hi> The Apoſtles, who walked by the Commiſſion, <hi>expreſs</hi> the Promiſe as the ground for Baptiſm, and <hi>expreſs</hi> the Children of Believers, as being now under this promiſe; And much more, as has been ſhown.</p>
            <p>Again, the Scripture <hi>expreſſes</hi> almoſt (if not) all that is to be repreſented in Baptiſm, by the word <hi>Sprinkle,</hi> &amp;c but none of them by <hi>Dipping.</hi> Nor is there one expreſs Scripture, nor neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that ever the Apoſtles or <hi>John</hi> Baptized by Dipping. This I averr, and dare challenge any <hi>Anti-pedo-baptiſt</hi> that goes on the ground, to deny any one of theſe Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>Now, if I am in an Error, I pray GOD that I may ſee it! and that this Book may not proſper if it defend Error! for I would not for a thouſand Worlds be inſtrumental to pervert Gods Truth or miſlead any Perſon. But if it be the Truth, I pray God defend and proſper it againſt all the Powers of Hell, and make it a means to convince ſuch as err from the Truth, and to confirm me and others in it, and in the good uſe of it. AMEN.</p>

            <p>IF it be worth while to trouble the Reader with it (which I had not intended to have done, but I underſtand the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> ſadly blame Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> for queſtioning Dr. <hi>Ruſſels</hi> skill in the <hi>Hebrew)</hi> Pag. 102. Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> complains of a <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Trouble</hi> put upon him to look the <hi>Hebrew, Dan.</hi> 4.33. It was indeed a <hi>needleſs Trouble</hi> to look for <hi>Hebrew</hi> there; for he that underſtands <hi>Hebrew</hi> when he reads it, will ſee, that the fourth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Daniel</hi> is not written in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> but in the <hi>Caldean Tongue.</hi> I do not blame him for being ignorant of <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> (if he be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant) if he be not a vain glorious Pretender to what he has not, and conſequently an ambitious willful Deceiver (I do not ſay he is ſuch an one) And I the rather inſert this, becauſe I have lately heard, that he has put out a book to render Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> &amp;c. as vile as may be, on purpoſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate his Narrative of the <hi>Portſmouth Diſpute</hi> (for I hear he has given out one.) I am not acqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inted with either of them, and know not their honeſty; But this, and many things more (ſome of which I mentioned before) look to me dubious on Dr. <hi>Ruſsels</hi> part.</p>
            <p>A bare Ignorance may be born with in them, if they do not pretend above their ſphere; but ſuch an Ignorance as I have heard of in one of their Preachers, who preaching how <hi>Chriſt being Rich,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:001635_0083_0FB3E29BAF4EFE10"/>became Poor for our ſakes,</hi> among other things, ſaid, <hi>He parted with his Eternity</hi> for a time; I think this is too groſs for a <hi>Communicant,</hi> and much more for a <hi>Teacher;</hi> ſome call it Blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak not this to vilify them, as Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> did the <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> in his ſtory of the Eunuchs Wife and Children, but to warn them to take better care to examine their Preachers, and to adviſe them to hear ſuch as can give a better reaſon for their Faith, and be leſs conceited of their own knowledge; For the man I ſpeak of has a great name among many of them. But if Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> had not told that Story, I had not told this; and I have as good Authority for my ſtory as he for his, <hi>I heard ſo,</hi> and that from a credible Perſon, that heard it.</p>
            <p>Well, Mr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> looked for <hi>Tabal,</hi> Dan. 4. 33. but it <hi>was not there.</hi> And how ſhould it, it being properly an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word, and the place <hi>Chaldee?</hi> But why does he not tell us what he found there, and what the advantage was to his Argument? For it is <hi>Tſabaa</hi> (or as it is comonly read <hi>Tſahang</hi>) there uſed [<hi>Jitſtabbaa</hi>] and in the <hi>Caldean</hi> Tongue ſignifies to Dip, as <hi>Tabal</hi> does in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> but may be applyed alſo to <hi>Sprinkling</hi> or Weting with the Dew, and ſo does <hi>Bapto,</hi> if Dr. <hi>Ruſsel</hi> ſay true, that the <hi>Greek</hi> here in the Tranſlation cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Septuagent,</hi> is <hi>Ebaphe,</hi> which differs from <hi>Bapto,</hi> juſt as much as <hi>He was wet,</hi> differs from <hi>I wet;</hi> For we muſt believe, whoever did it, they were ſuch as underſtood the uſe of <hi>Greek</hi> words in that Age (ſome time before Chriſt) ſo well or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then any do now.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>SInce the fore going <hi>Examination of the Portſmouth Diſpute</hi> was ſent to the Preſs, I got a ſight of the Narrative of the ſame diſpute given out by Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robinſon.</hi> They do not pretend to relate all that was ſpoken, but only ſo much as the Writers took down, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by moſt of the Arguments are given in ſhort; and where they found a neceſſity to add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by their Memory, to make the ſenſe, they gave it in other Characters, that it might be known. There are many Arguments which are not in Dr. <hi>Ruſſels,</hi> and they accuſe him of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what was not ſpoken, &amp;c. They have their Narrative atteſted by Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> one of the writers, that it agrees exactly with his and Mr. <hi>Malthy's</hi> Notes.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> and his Friends have ſet out a Reply, (entitled) <hi>Truth prevailing againſt the the fierceſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> (which <hi>I</hi> ſaw with it) wherein they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> of the ſame faults. I am not capable to ſay which of them ſpeaks the Truth; Though I was ſatisfyed when I had ſeen only Dr. <hi>Ruſsels,</hi> that it was not a true Relation (and that by the contents of it) I know not what theirs is. But in Dr. <hi>Ruſsels</hi> Reply, I am ſure he is wrong in ſome things.</p>
            <p>As for Inſtance. Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> to ſhow his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why he thinks Dr. <hi>Ruſsel</hi> beholding to others for his <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> tells of a Book which has falſe <hi>Greek,</hi> prefixed to the Title, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:001635_0086_0FB3E2A0238A7ED8"/>it done by Dr. <hi>Ruſsel,</hi> becauſe he gave it a New Edition, &amp;c. The words are <hi>Baptiſmon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daches;</hi> It ſhould have been <hi>didache,</hi> and then it had been proper, <hi>The Doctrine of Baptiſms;</hi> But <hi>didaches</hi> is <hi>Of the Doctrine,</hi> and always has relation to ſome other word fore-going, and ſo it is uſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. very properly, which Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, and ſuppoſes that Title taken thence by one that knew not the Nominative Caſe from the Genitive. This he does to ſhew the vanity of a man who would be thought to be more than he is.</p>
            <p>This Dr. <hi>Ruſsel</hi> ſpends many lines upon, and has it over in two places in his book, and infers that Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> accuſes the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> of falſe <hi>Greek,</hi> and improves it, That <hi>thus</hi> the <hi>Apostle muſt be whipt</hi> (by Mr. <hi>Chandler) to learn him better,</hi> &amp;c. By this I cannot but have the leſs eſteem of his Reports and Judgment in other things, ſeeing him ſo ſeverely condemn a man for that which he is not guilty of.</p>
            <p>They both uſe Expreſſions which I think tend more to <hi>exaſperate</hi> than to <hi>Edify.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Ruſsel</hi> and his Friends blame them much for ſuch Expreſſions, and ſee the evil of it ſo much themſelves, that they uſe no worſe than they can invent. For Inſtance, Becauſe they were accuſed of Lying, they call them <hi>Ill bred <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmannerly Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> and are themſelves ſo well bred that they call them <hi>Lyars,</hi> no plainer than it can be written, with many like Expreſſions; and toward the end of the Book, they call Mr. <hi>Chandler, A wicked man,</hi> and one of them deſires not his Prayers, becauſe the <hi>Prayers of the wicked is an Abomination.</hi>

Where Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> had ſaid that <hi>Bapto</hi> was uſed for the <hi>Dipping in the Diſh,</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Judas,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ruſ.</hi> ſays, <hi>It is utterly falſe.</hi> (Whereas it is certainly true.) It is not another verb, nor a word derived, more than <hi>He that Dippeth</hi> or <hi>Dipped,</hi> is a differing word from <hi>dip.</hi> (It is uſed in a Participle, and <hi>Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped</hi> is a Participle, from <hi>Dip,</hi> and ſo is <hi>Dipping.)</hi> It is indeed ſometimes compounded with a Prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to add to the ſignification [<hi>in</hi>] It is ſingle, <hi>John.</hi> 13.26. <hi>Bapſas,</hi> and alſo compound <hi>Emba<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>They blame Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> for ſaying <hi>Doop</hi> in Dutch ſignifies other waſhing. But the Dutch, who beſt underſtand it, uſe it, and ſo underſtand it for <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> as in Baptiſm, and many Dutch <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> for <hi>Pouring on water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>Doopen</hi> ſignifies alſo <hi>Dipping ſome part of</hi> a thing, to <hi>wet</hi> it, but when they ſpeak of <hi>Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping all over,</hi> they ſay <hi>Dompelen,</hi> and <hi>indompelen,</hi> not <hi>Doopen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to what is of more value.</p>
            <p>They argue much upon <hi>Johns</hi> denying Baptiſm, to ſome who were Church Members.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. 1ſt.</hi> Let them ſhew where it is written that he denyed them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> I think the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> will deny Church Priviledges to their diſorderly Members, and <hi>John</hi> threatn'd them that they ſhould be <hi>cut down, i. e.</hi> caſt out, if they did not bring forth good Fruits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> I think they will alſo warn their Church-Members not to truſt to their Church-Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip alone; as <hi>John</hi> did theſe.</p>

               <hi>4thly,</hi> I think it was the Phariſees themſelves that refuſed to be baptized.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> has a ſermon in ſaid Book full of erring reaſons.</p>
            <p>He denies thoſe to whom the promiſe was, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. to have been believers, Page 153. and in page 156. He ſays, That <hi>to have an Intereſt in the Covenant, an Intereſt in the Promiſe,</hi> and <hi>to be ferde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally holy, is the ſame thing.</hi> [<hi>True.</hi>] He alſo denies that thoſe had an intereſt in the Promiſe, and ſays, It was only offered to them. But the words in the ſcripture are <hi>The Promiſe is to you,</hi> and not <hi>It may be.</hi> And I will believe the ſcripture firſt. And if they were not Believers, then I infer, That Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers may be in Covenant with God, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Goſpel Covenant; (For there is no other now) and ſo be Church-Members, <hi>de jure.</hi> And I hope he that is a Goſpel Church-Member (of right) is a ſubject of Baptiſm, and therefore <hi>(ad hominem</hi>) Infants whom they account Unbelievers may be ſubjects of Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>If they object, it is alſo <hi>to thoſe afar off,</hi> then I <hi>anſw.</hi> The verb <hi>eſti,</hi> is, cannot be in the preſent and future Tenſe both, but it is ſuited to the neareſt, it <hi>is</hi> to them, and <hi>will be</hi> to the other when they are called, and made nigh, as thoſe were; For thoſe afar off are <hi>ſtrangers to the Covenant of Promiſe, having no Hope, and without God in the world,</hi> Eph. 2. But it could not be ſo with theſe who were not of thoſe afar off. (<hi>See more in my Third Chap.</hi>) He alſo denies that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is come in the room of <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi> becauſe they were both in force at once, <hi>viz.</hi> in the time of <hi>Johns</hi> Miniſtry.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I know of none that ſay it is in all things come in the room of Circumciſion. (Circumciſion ſignifyed ſomething which Baptiſm does not, and ſo muſt remain after Baptiſm began, till the Blood of Chriſt was ſhed.) And when a new Miniſtry, of a more ſpiritual Adminiſtration of the Covenant began (As in <hi>John</hi> and the Apoſtles) then Baptiſm, the ſign of this ſpiritual Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, began. Baptiſm is the ſign of giving the Holy Spirit, and ſo of worſhipping <hi>not at</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>but in ſpirit and Truth,</hi> which was began be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Worſhip ended, which it came in the room of, <hi>John.</hi> 4.23. <hi>The time cometh and now is,</hi> &amp;c. Circumciſion was the Token of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, and Baptiſm is the Token of giving the Holy Ghoſt, and that is Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with us, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.21. <hi>This is my Covenant, my ſpirit, &amp;c.</hi> So Baptiſm is <hi>Now</hi> what Circumciſion <hi>then</hi> was, <hi>viz.</hi> the Token of the Covenant, and Children are in the Covenant, on their Parents account, without reſpect of another Call, if to have an Intereſt in the Covenant or in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, be the ſame thing [<hi>ſee more in my ſixt Chap. Arg.</hi> 8]</p>
            <p>Alſo, Mr. <hi>Sharp</hi> in that Book (for it has many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and all approved by Dr. <hi>Ruſsel</hi>) ſays, pag. 38 very well, that <hi>Infants are made meet for Glory by the work of the ſpirit, which (to us) is altogether ſecret.</hi> Now this muſt be by Sanctification (I hope) And he Sanctifies them thro'-out (I hope) And if ſo, they muſt have a habit of every Grace, and if ſo, of Faith too (and <hi>I</hi> think they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meet for Heaven while their natural un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:001635_0090_0FB3E2A629ED9CB0"/>remains full, and they in that part no way Sanctifyed) and if ſo, they are Subjects of Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>This is <hi>to us ſecret,</hi> and ſo a Faith to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen. And why will they not believe it then, except they ſee it?</p>
            <p>However, theſe Infants have the Spirit; And who can forbid them Baptiſm? <hi>ſee more in my fifth Chapter,</hi> and alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. and Acts 10.</p>
            <p>And Now, Mr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> where is your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, That <hi>Infants Baptiſm hath neither Precept nor Precedent in the Word of God?</hi> When the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter</hi> Challenged any one that dare deny it them? If you ſay True, That <hi>the Spirit makes them meet for Glory;</hi> The Spirit is Promiſed in the Covenant; Baptiſm is the Sign of it, and <hi>Peter</hi> argues well, that ſuch as God has taken into his Covenant, by giving what it <hi>Promiſes</hi> ſhould have the <hi>Sign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Promiſe is at leaſt Conditional to all that are <hi>Called,</hi> and their Children; Theſe we know, and theſe are viſible Members.</p>
            <p>The Promiſe is abſolute to all that are <hi>Choſen;</hi> Theſe we know not, but by their Calling.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given a taſte of the good that may be gotten out of their Book, but I forbear to enlarge, except they Re-print that alſo.</p>

            <p>SINCE I ſent my <hi>Examination of the Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth Diſpute</hi> to the Preſs, I have ſeen a Book written againſt <hi>Poedo-Baptiſm,</hi> by one <hi>Phillip Cary,</hi> Prefaced and highly approved by <hi>Will.

Sleed, Benj Keach</hi> and <hi>M.E.</hi> wherein is this Paſſage, p 65.<q>Now it cannot be ſuppoſed that the Infants of Believers <hi>Indifferently</hi> or <hi>Univerſally</hi> have <hi>actually</hi> the thing ſignified by <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> that is, <hi>The holy Ghoſt, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt, Adoption, Forgiveneſs of Sins, Regeneration</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life;</hi> for then they are all Sanctified, and all Believers; and if that could be proved, there would be no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion about <hi>Poedo-Baptiſm;</hi> Thoſe Texts, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. chap. 10.47 and 11.17 would undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably prove it. And there is no <hi>Anti-Poedo-baptiſt</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="unknown:001635_0092_0FB3E2A9335CCDC0"/>but will grant, that all thoſe concerning whom there is any <hi>Tolerable Evidence</hi> given that they are <hi>Regenerated Perſons, united to Chriſt,</hi> whoſe <hi>Sins are forgiven,</hi> and that they have <hi>received the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> are to be baptized. Now to affirm that all infants of Believers, either actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally or Imputatively <hi>are Sanctified, Regenerated, Juſtified, is quite contrary to</hi> Rom. 9.6 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo to daily experience.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This they bring as an Argument againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> We cannot Prove that they all have the thing ſignified by Baptiſm, Yea, that it is evident that ſome have not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Reply. 1ſt.</hi> By the ſame Rule, <hi>no Adult</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt be Baptized; for we cannot prove that all who profeſs Faith, and viſibly appear to have it, are believers with all their Heart; Yea, it is evident, that many have not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> By this Rule, Where there is any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Evidence given, that an Infant is <hi>Regenerated, United to Chriſt</hi> &amp;c. that Infant is to be Baptized. Now to know whether there be or no, let us Year what they ſay pag. 57.
<q>We do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Infants from the great Work of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. And Pag. 59. We do not exclude Infants of Believers from the Ordinary way of Salvation; and they may be ſanctified by the Spirit of God.</q> Thus, if we may believe them, There is a tolerable Evidence given of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of believers, that they are <hi>Regenerated, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited to Chriſt</hi> (for that is the Ordinary way of Salvation) that their Sins are forgiven, and that they have received the Holy Ghoſt. But
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:001635_0093_0FB3E2AAE7CF0658"/>
               <hi>we are not Sure they all are Regenerate, &amp;c.</hi> No more are we of any Adult Perſon profeſſing it. It is not an Aſſurance but a tollerable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that is required unto Baptiſm; we know that ſome Infants of Believers are <hi>united to Chriſt,</hi> and while we have no more reaſon to doubt of <hi>this Infant</hi> more than of <hi>that,</hi> we have a tolerable Evidence for both, and this is as much as can be ſaid of <hi>Adult perſons</hi> profeſſing Faith</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> By this Rule, if Infants are ſaved in the ordinary way, then they are Sanctified, and are Believers. And now ye <hi>Anti-Poedo-Baptiſts,</hi> where is your Argument <hi>That an infant cannot be a Believer?</hi> For by your own words, ſome Infants are Believers, and are to be Baptized. Get this off if you can, and if your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will allow you to oppoſe the Truth, which is ſo evident as to force a confeſſion from thoſe who do their utmoſt to oppoſe it.</p>
            <p>And I would know why ſome Infants may not have a <hi>Principle</hi> of Faith without exerciſe, ſo well as all Infants have a <hi>Principle</hi> of Reaſon without exerciſe.</p>
            <p>If there need a further Teſtimony, I add a fourth Argument to my ſecond Chapter, Rom. 4.11. <hi>And he received the Sign of Circumciſion, the Seal of the Faith, which he had.</hi> &amp;c. Hence</p>
            <p>If Circumciſion was a Seal of Faith, then all that were to be circumciſed, were ſuch of whom there was a viſible or tollerable Evidence that they were believers. The Infants of viſible believer were to be circumciſed. Again,</p>
            <p>If Circumciſion was a ſign or Seal of Faith
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:001635_0094_0FB3E2AC35AF54F8"/>then it was of the ſame uſe that Baptiſm is now, and Baptiſm is come in the room of it, and Circumciſion was a Token of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>But the principal deſign of their Book is to ſhut Infants out of the Covenant of Grace, by anſwering the Arguments that prove them in it, ſo they deny that circumciſion was appointed as a Seal or ſign of Faith in <hi>all,</hi> tho' it was ſo in <hi>Abraham, Beauſe he was circumciſed to be the Father of al them that believe, &amp;c. which others were not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Then it was a Covenant of <hi>Faith,</hi> to which he was circumciſed; and as the <hi>believing Father,</hi> ſo the <hi>believing Children</hi> were to be circumciſed. If he had been circumciſed to be the Father of the <hi>Legally righteous,</hi> it had been to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Again, they object <hi>He was to be</hi> Heir of the World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> An anſwerable Heirſhip belongs to his believing Children, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>Again, they ſay, <hi>Some were circumciſed who were not true believers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The ſame Rule may deny <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to be uſed as a ſign of Faith; For many are Baptized who are not true believers, and even falſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the Apoſtles days.</p>
            <p>Again, they deny <hi>That the circumciſion Covenant required Regeneration,</hi> &amp;c. contrary to <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.26. and many other Scriptures in both Teſtaments, alſo contrary to expreſs Sripture, which calls circumciſion the <hi>Token of the Covenant,</hi> and as a Token required <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servants to
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:001635_0095_0FB3E2ADB4D2DB90"/>be circumciſed. They deny that theſe were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant, <hi>Becauſe God would eſtabliſh his Covenant with</hi> Iſaac.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. 1ſt.</hi> Even at this day the Covenant is not eſtabliſhed with all viſible believers, but only with true Believers <hi>2dly.</hi> The Covenant ſo to be eſtabliſhed with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and not with the reſt, was the Heirſhip of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again, they object Gal. 5. <hi>If ye be circumciſed Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> that was after Circumciſion was aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, becauſe Chriſts blood (which it Typified) was now already ſhed. Now to be circumciſed did vertually deny any benefit by the Sufferings of Chriſt, which were paſt, and conſequently any benefit at all; but if it had been ſo before, Then <hi>Abraham</hi> and the <hi>Propkets</hi> and <hi>all Iſrael</hi> had no profit by Chriſt. In this Sence it is that <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and the <hi>Levitical Prieſthood</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies annexed</hi> were legal; They were <hi>only</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant of Chriſt and his ſufferings <hi>to come</hi> (and ſo in the time of them were purely <hi>Evangelical</hi>) But when the <hi>Anti-type</hi> was come, the uſe of them did, by ſignifying that it was yet to come, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy a denyal of him, and ſo bound men to the Law for Salvation: and thus became purely <hi>Legal.</hi> And the aboliſhing of this Law by the coming of Chriſt, typifies our being freed from the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> and <hi>Curſe of the Low</hi> by <hi>Faith in Chriſt.</hi> Theſe ſignifying only things to come, expired of Courſe, when they were come, and yet were expreſly repealed, much
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:001635_0096_0FB3E2AF2C547ED8"/>more would Infants <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Right to the ſign of the Covenant of Grace, (if that had expired alſo) After circumciſion was aboliſhed, the uſe of it tending to deny that Chriſt had already paid the price of our Redemption, left men under the Covenant of the Law, which we are all by nature under, till redeemed from it by Chriſt. In a word, circumciſion was the ſign of the <hi>Circumciſion of the Heart,</hi> which is <hi>Regeneration</hi> or a <hi>New Creature,</hi> and cannot be without the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, and is the ſelf-ſame which is <hi>now</hi> ſignified by Baptiſm, and belongs wholly to the Covenant of Grace; And this the Apoſtle ſufficiently declares to have been the uſe of circumciſion before it was aboliſhed, and makes that an Argument againſt it, now it obliges to the Covenant of works.</p>
            <p>But they object, That Baptiſm is not a Seal (as Circumciſion was) Becauſe <hi>It is by the Holy Spirit that we are Sealed to the day of Redemption,</hi> Eph. 4.30.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. 1ſt.</hi> The Spirit is not there ſpoken of, as the matter and form of the Seal, but as the <hi>Efficient</hi> or Author of the Sanctification ſignifyed by it, which is a <hi>Sure</hi> Pledge of Salvation; deny this he that can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> A Seal is an appointed viſible ſign for confirmation, which Circumciſion <hi>was</hi> and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm <hi>is,</hi> of the Covenant of Grace, and Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, ſo far as it is <hi>viſible</hi> of Eternal life, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>Again, they ſay <hi>pag</hi> 42 that ſtrangers bought

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. 1ſt.</hi> By the ſame Rule they may deny the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> to be a Goſpel, Becauſe it contains many Threatnings. <hi>2dly.</hi> It is expreſſed to be a covenant beſide the covenant made in Horeb, <hi>i. e.</hi> when they came out of the land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Now beſide, is as much as <hi>another,</hi> and ſo not the ſame, Yet they ſay <hi>it was the ſame,</hi> and ſo they contradict expreſs Scripture.

            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="unknown:001635_0098_0FB3E2B22C2F9988"/>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 14. They ſay <hi>Abrahams Church State is at an End.</hi> Wherein they contradict the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. and ſomething elſe. Theſe are their principal Arguments in the Book. I return to the proof of Infants being in the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 25. They ſay, <hi>Now it is true, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the</hi> Subſtance <hi>of the Covenant, we have the ſame graffting into the Olive, the Church of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, of which</hi> Abraham <hi>is the root.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pag. 30 They ſay, <hi>The Intereſt which a Child had in the Everlaſting Covenant under the former Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, it ſtill retains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it follows, that Infants were in the Covenant of Grace under the former Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and are ſtill.</p>
            <p>And if it was under an Adminiſtration, there muſt have been ſomething <hi>adminiſtred</hi> to them, by virtue of their Intereſt in the everlaſting Covenant, or Covenant of Grace The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>that</hi> and <hi>this</hi> Adminiſtration, was in viſible Ordinances; ſo there muſt have been a <hi>Goſpel Covenant Ordinance</hi> adminiſtred then to Infants. Tell me he that can what this was, except <hi>Circumciſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And from the Quotations p. 25. it ſeems <hi>Abrahams</hi> Church is ſtill in being, and is a Goſpel Church, and we are in it. Tell us where our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are turned out, before they turn themſelves out by unbelief and Diſobedience? (as the <hi>Jews</hi> did in our <hi>Saviours time,</hi> and as many evil deeds did (by Gods Command from <hi>Abrahams</hi> time) require a <hi>cuting off from their People,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:001635_0099_0FB3E2B3B5F727B0"/>they had <hi>Abraham to their Father,</hi> which the proud Phariſees did not conſider, till <hi>John</hi> told them of it) ſeeing a Child ſtill retains the Intereſt it had then.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 62 They tell us <hi>In Chriſt and a right to the Promiſes Out of Chriſt,</hi> and ſtrangers to the Covenant of Promiſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12.</p>
            <p>Hence it follows, ſeeing Infants are ſaved in the <hi>Ordinary way,</hi> which is by being <hi>United to Chriſt,</hi> and there is no Salvation out of Chriſt) ſome Infants are in Chriſt, and therefore have a right in the Promiſes.</p>
            <p>The Qeſtion is, where thoſe promiſes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded? If it be the Promiſes to believers, then ſome Infants are believers (but that is already granted, p 65. For if all Infants of believers are <hi>United to Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. then they are <hi>al Believers;</hi> So ſeeing only ſome are, there are ſome Infants Believers. I admire the Impudence of ſome men to forbid them Baptiſm, ſeeing all agree that the Commiſſion requires the Baptiſm of all Believers, Yea, and that a tollerable Evidence is ſufficient, even where there is ground in Charity to hope it). But if the Promiſe to Infants be where little Children were brought to Chriſt, then the promiſe is only to ſuch as are brought, for of ſuch is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven; I mean we know not that it is to more. Now theſe muſt be brought by order of believing Parents or Maſters; for unbelievers will not bring theirs.</p>
            <p>If it be the Promiſes to Believers, and their Children, we alſo know what Infants they are,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:001635_0100_0FB3E13A67774580"/>whom we are to account in the Covenant. One would think now that we had done, ſeeing they own <hi>Abrahams</hi> Church to be a Goſpel Church, and ſtill in being, and we in it, and that our Infants ſtill retain their right in that Everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they are not ſo willing to be convinced themſelves or to leave gaining Proſelites (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Children commonly are proſelyted and made their Diſciples by virtue of their Parents being proſelited) But ſeeing it will not do after ſpending ſo many Sheets of Paper: but infants will be in the Covenant of Grace and under the Promiſe ſtill, They even conclude to do as well <hi>another way,</hi> and deny the <hi>Covenant or Promiſe to be the Ground of Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now</hi> if by the <hi>Ground</hi> or <hi>Rule</hi> they mean the Commiſſion or Command, we will agree with them, that the Promiſe is not the Command.</p>
            <p>But if they deny that the Commiſſion requires the baptizing of all that are viſibly in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or under the promiſe, and no others, we muſt try to confute them. We muſt remember they tell us <hi>Out of Chriſt and ſtrangers to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of promiſe,</hi> Therefore if a right in the Promiſe, then in Chriſt, and if in Chriſt, that is, United to him, <hi>Then they are Sanctified, and are believers,</hi> and then thoſe Texts <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47. <hi>Acts</hi> 11.17. do undeniably prove their right to Baptiſm. All this they ſay, and therefore nothing without the promiſe is a Rule for Baptiſm (as I once ſaid) <hi>That is,</hi> nothing but by virtue of the Promiſe.</p>
            <p>If any reject their Teſtimony, as Humane
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:001635_0101_0FB3E13BE5DBAA68"/>(though ſufficiently grounded on the Scripture (underſtood with the diſtinctions between <hi>really</hi> and <hi>conditionally,</hi> and <hi>viſibly</hi>) The Gift or promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, is the reaſon for Baptiſm, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38.</p>
            <p>The Covenant is the Gift or promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Jſai.</hi> 56 <hi>ult.</hi> And till ſome in the revealed Covenant are excepted, we take this for a Rule.</p>
            <p>I pray God to give them a Heart willing to believe the Truth. I was told by one of their conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Preachers,</hi> in the preſence of ſeveral of their people, That <hi>if my Book contain matters of Faith (i. e.</hi> Arguments againſt their Practice) <hi>I might be Sure it would be anſwered.</hi> Which implies they are reſolved not to believe it, and that before they know what it is. To what purpoſe ſhall Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be uſed with ſuch men! I hope they will conſider better. But if an Anſwer come out againſt my Book, we have cauſe to fear from what principle it comes. The Lord make us all willing to believe the Truth!</p>
            <p>Thus I have given an account of the principal Arguments in this Book, ſo highly commended by ſeveral of their Chief Writers, as the excelling all that went before it.</p>
            <p>The latter part of the Book is cheifly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the two Covenants, wherein <hi>I</hi> take him to be partly right, but it does not much concern the controverſy. He often flies to their common refuge, of crying out againſt uſing that in Gods Worſhip which he has not commanded. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he owns that to be an <hi>undenyable proof for Baptiſm</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="unknown:001635_0102_0FB3E13D67976BF8"/>if it were in Infants; which he owns to be in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants (as I have ſhown).</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> add yet, which might end the controverſy, We need ſome humane means to underſtand the Holy Scriptures, as to learn to ſpeak and read, ſo we need <hi>Hiſtory</hi> to underſtand the Propheſies in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> and the <hi>Revelations,</hi> ſo we need to ſearch <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity</hi> to know in what ſenſe any doubtful word in the Scripture was uſed in the <hi>Nation and Age</hi> wherein it was written; and ſome have proved that the name of <hi>Proſelyte</hi> or <hi>Diſciple</hi> was given to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants with their Parents, in the age when our Saviour lived on Earth, and is ſo by the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtill; And that the Apoſtle and ſuch as firſt followed them underſtood the commiſſion no other way.</p>
            <p>I deſire the Reader to excuſe me, having had no opportunity this twenty years to read Ancient Hiſtory; if <hi>I</hi> miſtook about <hi>Pelagius,</hi> ſetting him a hundred Years too late, and ſaying, <hi>he denyed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants baptiſm,</hi> which was only judged the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his Doctrine, But he being charged with it, ſaid, <hi>He never heard that ever any man denyed it,</hi> &amp;c. And this was ſufficient ground for <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to write in Defence of Infant Baptiſm, not to prove the thing (which was not denyed) but to prove it neceſſray as a ſign <hi>of Remiſſion of ſins,</hi> ſo well as for other reaſons. Alſo, I am not ſure whether <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did not defer his Baptiſm to be baptized in <hi>Jordan.</hi> Theſe things <hi>I</hi> have lately met with in Quotations, and will not truſt my memory.</p>
            <p>But finding that <hi>Pelag us</hi> made this reply, after he had travelled many Countryes <hi>I</hi> infer, that
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:001635_0103_0FB3E13EE995F730"/>Denying Infants Baptiſm was ſo little thought of, two or three hundred years after the Apoſtles days, that he whoſe Doctrine led directly to it, did not then once think of bringing ſuch a new unknown thing into the Church, and it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that men of his parts and learning and Travel ſhould not have known it, if ever it had been denyed in the ſpace of two or three hundred Years before.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> do by the Books of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> as they do by many Authors now, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the <hi>Church Catechiſm,</hi> out of which they may as well make thoſe that know not the <hi>Church of England,</hi> believe, that they deny Infant Baptiſm, as they do now make, ſuch as know no better, believe, the Fathers denyed it.</p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>Tertullian,</hi> by himſelf, was againſt Baptizing Infants or young perſons, except they were in danger of Death, leſt they ſhould not live anſwerably. This was no denying the thing, but accounted by him a point of prudence.</p>
            <p>I have alſo to advertiſe the Reader, that in the beginning of my ſecond Chapter, in Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s firſt Argument, I had alſo Referrence to his fourth Argument, where he inſiſts upon the ſame Fallacy in many pages together, though he pretends not to inſiſt upon it, and pretends to be content with <hi>any proof,</hi> and yet nothing will ſerve him but an <hi>Inſtance.</hi> This <hi>I</hi> anſwered (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it a Fallacy) where I firſt found it; and indeed all his arguments, and all the Arguments they uſe againſt Infant Baptiſm depend upon that <hi>one Fallacy,</hi> as he that obſerves will find.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="unknown:001635_0104_0FB3E140604250E8"/>
Hence the ground of their Faith in ſeperation from all other Chriſtians, depends on a falſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and ſo we ſee the Ground they have to <hi>rend</hi> the Church of Chriſt to pieces, and <hi>tear</hi> his members one from another, and cauſe the <hi>Wounds</hi> and <hi>Pains</hi> of <hi>Strife, Anger</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,</hi> and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Love</hi> (ſo earneſtly recomended by our Lord and Saviour, as his <hi>delight,</hi> and the <hi>Glory of his Kingdom,</hi> and the way for our <hi>Edification</hi>) and cauſe, in ſtead thereof, <hi>Contention, Miſ-ſpending of Time, Lying, Revenge</hi> and every evil Work.</p>
            <p>One Word more, becauſe ſome excuſe their Re-baptizing, from <hi>Acts</hi> 19.5.</p>
            <p>That verſe is only a continuation of <hi>Pauls</hi> words, wherein be tells what <hi>John</hi> ſaid to ſuch as came to him, and that <hi>when they heard it, they were baptized in the Name of the</hi> Lord Jeſus (<hi>i. e.</hi> by <hi>John</hi>) And when <hi>Paul</hi> had told them this, he laid his hands upon them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Suppoſe it were doubtful whether it was thus, or whether they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized again, who that fears God would venture upon a doubtful Interpretation of Scripture, to deny his Baptiſm, the ſign of his Covenant with God, and thereby uſe the ſign of caſting himſelf out of the Covenant of Grace, as they that were circumciſed (after Circumciſion was aboliſhed) did, to be taken in a-new? For there is but one <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> and one <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> the ſign of it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5. and he that is caſt out, cannot take himſelf in again, and has no other ſhelter to fly to. There is help in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> for ſuch as have broke the <hi>Law Covenant,</hi> but no more help for ſuch as are caſt out of the <hi>Goſpel Covenant</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="unknown:001635_0105_0FB3E141E22A79A8"/>Therefore take heed of uſing the ſign of it! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>reſembles</hi> the thing it ſelf! and there is no Covenant but the Goſpel to be ſaved by, ſince the Fall.</p>
            <p>I find ſome of their Authors tell us, that Gods Word has limitted Baptiſm to <hi>Actual Believers.</hi> I deſire them to ſhew the Scripture for it; They deſpiſe the diſtinction of <hi>Compleat</hi> and <hi>Incompleat</hi> Diſciples, as unſcriptural. But where is the Scripture for <hi>Actual Believers,</hi> in diſtinction from another ſort. A diſtinction may be made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scripture, but then we may not apply that to the one which we deny to the other without Scripture. Now if they find the Scripture that tells us what Believers muſt be baptized, and which not, and the like of Diſciples, we will hear them.</p>
            <p>Thus they fly from Church Memberſhip, the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> Yea, and <hi>ſome Faith,</hi> being the ground of Baptiſm, when theſe are proved in Infants, rather then yield, and that after they have ſo long ſtrove to keep them out of all, and that after they have owned, that if theſe things could be proved, they ought to be baptized; <hi>Lord what ſhall be done with ſuch Men, who are reſolved not to ſee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other day occaſionally opening the <hi>Greek</hi> Teſtament, I hit upon <hi>John</hi> 20.4, 5. <hi>And the other Diſciple out-ran</hi> Peter, <hi>&amp; came firſt [eis to Menemeon] to the Sepulcher,</hi> v. 5—<hi>but he went not in.</hi> This alone is enough to cut off all their pretence from the Baptized going into the water. and for their coming out of the water, it is as much as thoſe,
