            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>UNDERSTANDING you are vastly fond of plays and farces, and frequently exhibit them for your own amusement, and the laudable purpose of ridiculing your masters (the</hi> Yankees, <hi>as you call 'em) it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected you would have been polite enough to have favoured the world, or America at least, (at whose expence you act them) with some of your play-bills, or with a sample of your composition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I shall however not copy your churlishness, but dedicate the following Tragi-Comedy to your patronage, and for your future entertainment; and as the most of you have already acted your particular parts of it, both comic and tragic, in reality at Lexington, Bunker's-hill, the Great-Bridge, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. to the very great applause of yourselves, tho' not of the whole house, no doubt you will preserve the marks, or memory of it, as long as you live, as it is wrote in capital American characters and letters of blood on your posteriors: And however some Whigs may censure you for your affected mirth (as they
<pb n="IV" facs="unknown:014823_0003_0F9738EAE9E5B158"/>
term it, in the deplorable situation you are now in, like bogs in a pen, and in want of elbow room) yet I can by no means agree with them, but think it a proof of true heroism and philosophy, to endeavour to make the best of a bad bargain, and laugh at yourselves, to prevent others from laughing at you; and tho' you are deprived of the use of your teeth, it is no reason you should be bereaved of the use of your tongues, your eyes, your ears, and your risible faculties and powers. That would be cruel indeed! after the glorious and fatiguing campaign you have made, and the many signal victories obtained over whole herbs of cattle and swine, routing flocks of sheep, lambs and geese, storming hen-roosts, and taking them prisoners, and thereby raising the glory of Old England to a pitch she never knew before. And ye Macs, and ye Donalds upon Donalds, go on, and may our gallows-bills and liberty poles be honour'd and adorn'd with some of your heads: Why should Tyburn and Temple-bar make a monopoly of so valuable a commodity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wishing you abundance of entertainment in the re-acting this Tragi-Comedy, and of which I should be proud to take a part with you, tho' I have reason to think you would not of choice let me come within three hundred yards of your stage, lest I should rob you of your laurels, receive the clap of the whole house, and pass for a second Garrick among you, as you, know I always act with applause, speak bold—point blank—off hand—and without prompter.</hi>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SOLOMON said, "Oppression makes a wise man mad:" but what would he have said, had he lived in these days, and seen the oppression of the people of Boston, and the distressed situation of the inhabitants of Charlestown, Falmouth, Stonning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Bristol, Norfolk, &amp;c. Would he not have said, <q>The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst; the young children ask for bread, but no man breaketh it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them?</q> 
               <q>They that did feed delicately, perish in the streets; they that were brought up in scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, embrace the dung.</q> What would he have said of rejected petitions, disregarded supplications, and contemned remonstrances? Would he not have said, "From hardness of heart, good Lord, deliver us?" What would he have said of a freeborn people butchered—their towns desolated, and become an heap of ashes—their inhabitants become beggars, wanderers and vagabonds—by the cruel orders of an unrelenting tyrant, wallowing in luxury, and wantonly wasting the people's wealth, to oppress them the more? Would he not have said, it was oppression and ingratitude in the highest degree, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the oppression of the children of Israel? and, like Moses, have cried out, let the people go? Would he not have wondered at our patience and long-suffering, and have said, 'Tis time to change our master!—'Tis time to part!—And had he been an American born, would he not have shewed his wisdom by adopting the language of independency? Happy then for America in these fluctuating times, she is not without her Solomons, who see the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I'll wave my own pretensions, and bend my power and affiduity to it in favour of one, the nearest a kin to me, you know who I mean, and a particular friend of yours, provided I continue to be dictator, as at present; and further, I intend America shall submit.—What think you of it so far?</p>

                  <p>As to the militia, they are half of them my friends, witness Lancaster, Manchester, Liver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool, &amp;c, &amp;c. &amp;c. the other half scarce ever fired a gun in their lives, especially those of London, and I shall take care by shaking the keys a little to have such officers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed over them, who are well known to be in my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest. As to the German forces, I have nothing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend from them; the parliament can soon pass an act against the introduction of foreign troops, exept the French or Spaniards, who can't be called foreign, they are our friends and nearest neighbours.

Are not the daily papers filled with treasonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves of American congresses and committees, extracts of letters, and other infamous pieces and scurrilous pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, circulating with unusual industry throughout the kingdom, by the enemies of Britain, thereby poisoning the minds of our liege subjects with their detestable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets?—And did you not this day see the procession, and that vile miscreant Lord Patriot at their head, going to St. James's with their remonstrance, in such state and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade as manifestly tended to provoke, challenge and defy majesty itself, and the powers of government? and yet nothing done to stop their pernicious effects.—Surely, my Lords and Gentlemen, you must agree with me, that it is now become highly expedient that an immediate stop should be put to such unwarrantable and dangerous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, by the most vigorous and coercive measures.</p>

                  <p>I entirely agree with your Lordship, and was ever firmly of opinion, that licentiousness of every kind, (particularly that of the Press) is dangerous to the state; the rabble should be kept in awe by examples of severity, and a proper respect should be enforced to supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors. I have sufficiently shewn my dislike to the freedom of the press, by the examples I have frequently made (tho' too favourable) of several printers, and others, who had greatly trespassed, and if they still persist, other measures should be taken with them, which the laws will point out; and as to Lord Patriot, he's a fellow that has been out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law'd, scandal proof, little to be got by meddling with him; I would advise to let him alone for the present, and humble America first.</p>

there are numbers of men in this country who are ever studying how to perplex and entangle the state, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly thwarting government, in ev'ry laudable under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; this clamorous faction must be curbed, must be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and crush'd—our thunder must go forth, America must be conquered.

                  <p>I entirely agree with you, Mr. Brazen; my advice is, that Lord Boston and Admiral Tombstone be immediately despatch'd to Boston, with two or three regiments (tho' one would be more than sufficient) and a few ships to shut up their ports, disannul their charter, stop their trade, and the pusillanimous beggars, those scoundrel rascals, whose predominant passions are impudence and fear, would immediately give up, on the first landing of the regulars, and fly before 'em like a hare before the hounds; that this would be the case, I pawn my honour to your Lordships, nay I'll sacrifice my life: My Lords, I have more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the testimony of General Amherst and Colonel Grant to back my assertion; besides here's Mr. Judas, let him speak.</p>

No, 'tis impossible!-View that arch-dragon, that old fiend, Paramount, that rebel in grain, whispering in his ear. View his wretched ministers hovering round him, to accomplish their accursed purpose, and accelerate his destruction—View the whole herd of administration (I know 'em well) and tell me if the world can furnish a viler set of miscreants? View both houses of parliament, and count the number of Tyrants, Jacobites, Tories, Placemen, Pensioners, Sycophants and Panders. View the constitution, is she not disrob'd and dismantled? is she not become like a virgin deflower'd? View our fleets and armies commanded by bloody murdering butchers!

scale of Europe. When a British king proves ungrateful and haughty, and strives to be independent of his people, (who are his sole support) the people will in their turn likewise strive to be independent of him and his myrmidons, and will be free; they will erect the anfractuous standard of independency, and thousands and tens of thousands will flock to it, and solace themselves under its shade.—They have often been told of this, but affected to despise it; they know not America's strength, they are ignorant of it; fed by the flatt'ry of every sycophant tale, imagine themselves almighty, and able to subdue the whole world. America will be lost to Britain for ever, and will prove her downfall. America is wise, and will shake off the galling yoke before it be rivetted on them; they will be drove to it, and who can blame them? Who can blame a gally slave for making his escape?—Britain will miscarry in her vile projects, her knight errant, her Don Quixotte schemes in America: America will resist; they are not easily to be subdued; (nay 'tis impossible) Britain will find it a harder task than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer France and Spain united, and will cost 'em more blood and treasure than a twice seven years war with those European powers; they will stand out 'till Britons are tired. Britain will invite her with kind promises and open arms; America will reject them; America will triumph, rejoice and flourish, and become the glory of the earth; Britain will languidly hold down her head, and become first a prey to a vile Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I should not be at all surpris'd to hear of independency pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd throughout their land, of Britain's armies beat, their fleets burnt, sunk, or otherwise destroy'd. The same principle which Mr. Brazen speaks of, that inspires British soldiers to fight, namely the ferment of youthful blood, the high spirit of the people, a love of glory, and a sense of national honour, will inspire the Americans to withstand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>Sir, my reason is not to be trifled with. Do you not see or hear ev'ry day of insults and provocations to the peaceable inhabitants? This is only a prelude. Can men of spirit bear forever with such usage? I know not what business they have here at all.</p>

                  <p>Nay, Sir, I know not their business;—let us yet bear with them 'till we know the success of the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Congress;—if unfavourable, then it will be our time.</p>

Here I cannot stay;—there I may behold something favourable to calm this tumult in my breast.—But, alas! I fear—Guards, attend me.</p>

               <head>Roger and Dick, two shepherds near LEXINGTON, after the defeat and flight of the Regulars.</head>

                  <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                  <p>Whilst early looking, Dick, ere the sun was seen to tinge the brow of the mountain, for my flock of sheep, nor dreaming of approaching evil, suddenly mine eyes beheld from you hill a cloud of dust arise at a small distance; the intermediate space were thick set with laurels, willows, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greens, and bushes of various kinds, the growth of wild nature, and which hid the danger from my eyes, thinking perchance my flock had thither stray'd; I descended, and straight onward went; but, Dick, judge you my thoughts at such a disappointment: Instead of my innocent flock of sheep, I found myself almost encircled by a herd of ravenous British wolves.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dick.</speaker>
                  <p>Dangerous must have been your situation, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whatever were your thoughts.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                  <p>I soon discovered my mistake; finding a hostile appearance, I instantly turn'd myself about, and fled to alarm the shepherds.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dick.</speaker>
                  <p>Did they pursue you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                  <p>They did; but having the start, and being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the bye-ways, I presently got clear of their voracious jaws.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dick.</speaker>
                  <p>A lucky escape, indeed, Roger; and what rout did they take after that?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                  <p>Onwards, t'wards Lexington, devouring geese, cattle and swine, with fury and rage, which, no doubt, was increased by their disappointment; and what may appear strange to you, Dick, (tho' no more strange than true) is, they seem'd to be possessed of a kind of brutish music, growling something like our favourite tune Yankee Doodle, (perhaps in ridicule) 'till it were almost thread bare, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vastly pleased (monkey-like) with their mimickry, as tho' it provoked us much.</p>

                  <speaker>Dick.</speaker>
                  <p>Nature, Roger, has furnish'd some brute animals with voices, or, more properly speaking, with organs of sound that nearly resemble the human. I have heard of crocodiles weeping like a child, to decoy the unwary

traveller, who is no sooner within their reach, but they seize and devour instantly.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                  <p>Very true, Dick, I have read of the same; and these wolves, being of the canine breed, and having the properties of blood-hounds, no doubt are possess'd of a more acute sense of smelling, more reason, instinct, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity, or what shall I call it? than all other brutes. It might have been a piece of cunning of theirs, peculiar to them, to make themselves pass for shepherds, and decoy our flocks; for, as you know, Dick, all our shepherds both play and sing Yankee Doodle, our sheep and lambs are as well acquainted with that tune as ourselves, and always make up to us whene'er they hear the sound.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dick.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, Roger; and now you put me in mind of it I'll tell you of something surprising in my turn: I have an old ram and an old ewe, that, whenever they sing Yankee Doodle together, a skilful musician can scarcely distinguish it from the bass and tenor of an organ.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                  <p>Surprising indeed, Dick, nor do I in the least doubt it; and why not, as well as Balaam's ass, speak? and I might add, many other asses, now-a-days; and yet, how might that music be improved by a judicious disposition of its various parts, by the addition of a proper number of sheep and young lambs; 'twould then likewise resemble the counter, counter tenor, treble, and finest pipes of an organ, and might be truly called nature's organ; methinks, Dick, I could forever sit and hear such music,</p>

                  <speaker>Dick.</speaker>
                  <p>Delightful, indeed; I'll attempt it with what little skill I have in music; we may then defy these wolves to imitate it, and thereby save our flocks: I am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, Roger, these wolves intended it rather as a decoy than by way of ridicule, because they live by cunning and deception; besides, they could never mean to ridicule a piece of music, a tune, of which such brutes cannot be supposed to be judges, and, which is allowed by the best masters of music to be a composition of the most sublime kind, and would have done honour to a Handel or a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellius. Well, go on, Roger, I long to hear the whole.</p>

                  <p>When they came to Lexington, where a flock of our innocent sheep and young lambs, as usual, were feeding and sporting on the plain, these dogs of violence and rapine with haughty stride advanc'd, and berated them in a new and unheard of language to us.</p>

                  <p>Not content with this, their murdering leaders, with premeditated malice, keen appetite, and without provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, gave the howl for the onset, when instantly the whole herd, as if the devil had entered into them, ran violently down the hill, and fixed their talons and jaws upon them, and as quick as lightening eight innocent young lambs fell a sacrifice to their fury, and victims to their rapacity; the very houses of our God were no longer a sanctuary; many they tore to pieces, and some at the very foot of the altar; others were dragged out as in a wanton gamesome mood.</p>

                  <p>Well pleased, Roger, was I with the chace, and glorious sport it was: I oft perceiv'd them tumbling o'er each other heels over head; nor did one dare stay to help his brother—but, with bloody breech, made the best of his way—nor ever stopped 'till they were got safe within their lurking-holes—</p>

                  <p>May this be the fate of all those prowling sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stealers; it behooves the shepherds to double the watch, to take uncommon precaution and care of their tender flocks, more especially as this is like to be an uncommon severe winter, by the appearance of wolves so early in the season—but, hark!—Roger, methinks I hear the sound of melody warbling thro' the grove—Let's sit a while, and partake of it unseen.</p>

                  <p>With all my heart.—Most delightful harmony! This is the First of May; our shepherds and nymphs are celebrating our glorious St. Tammany's day; we'll hear the song out, and then join in the frolick, and chorus it o'er and o'er again—This day shall be devoted to joy and festivity.</p>

                  <p>I fully expected, with the help of the last reinforcement you brought me over, and the advice and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of three accomplish'd and experienc'd Generals, I should have been able to have subdued the rebels, and gain'd immortal laurels to myself—have return'd to Old England like a Roman Consul, with a score or two of the rebel Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, Colonels and Majors, to have grac'd my triumph.</p>

                  <p>Our late great loss of men has tore up the foundation of our plan, and render'd all further attempts impracticable—'twill be a long time ere we can expect any more reinforcements—and if they should arrive, I'm doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of their success.</p>

                  <p>The provincials are vastly strong, and seem no novices in the art of war; 'tis true we gain'd the hill at last, but of what advantage is it to us?—none—the loss of 1400 as brave men as Britain can boast of, is a melancholy consideration, and must make our most sanguinary friends in England abate of their vigour.</p>
