            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>UNDERSTANDING you are vastly fond of plays and farces, and frequently exhibit them for your own amusement, and the laudable purpose of ridiculing your masters (the</hi> Yankees, <hi>as you call 'em) it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected you would have been polite enough to have favoured the world, or America at least, (at whose expence you act them) with some of your play-bills, or with a sample of your composition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I shall however not copy your churlishness, but dedicate the following Tragi-Comedy to your patronage, and for your future entertainment; and as the most of you have already acted your particular parts of it, both comic and tragic, in reality at Lexington, Bunker's-hill, the Great-Bridge, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. to the very great applause of yourselves, tho' not of the whole house, no doubt you will preserve the marks, or memory of it, as long as you live, as it is wrote in capital American characters and letters of blood on your posteriors: And however some Whigs may censure you for your affected mirth (as they
<pb n="IV" facs="unknown:014823_0003_0F9738EAE9E5B158"/>
term it, in the deplorable situation you are now in, like bogs in a pen, and in want of elbow room) yet I can by no means agree with them, but think it a proof of true heroism and philosophy, to endeavour to make the best of a bad bargain, and laugh at yourselves, to prevent others from laughing at you; and tho' you are deprived of the use of your teeth, it is no reason you should be bereaved of the use of your tongues, your eyes, your ears, and your risible faculties and powers. That would be cruel indeed! after the glorious and fatiguing campaign you have made, and the many signal victories obtained over whole herbs of cattle and swine, routing flocks of sheep, lambs and geese, storming hen-roosts, and taking them prisoners, and thereby raising the glory of Old England to a pitch she never knew before. And ye Macs, and ye Donalds upon Donalds, go on, and may our gallows-bills and liberty poles be honour'd and adorn'd with some of your heads: Why should Tyburn and Temple-bar make a monopoly of so valuable a commodity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wishing you abundance of entertainment in the re-acting this Tragi-Comedy, and of which I should be proud to take a part with you, tho' I have reason to think you would not of choice let me come within three hundred yards of your stage, lest I should rob you of your laurels, receive the clap of the whole house, and pass for a second Garrick among you, as you, know I always act with applause, speak boldâpoint blankâoff handâand without prompter.</hi>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SOLOMON said, "Oppression makes a wise man mad:" but what would he have said, had he lived in these days, and seen the oppression of the people of Boston, and the distressed situation of the inhabitants of Charlestown, Falmouth, Stonning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Bristol, Norfolk, &amp;c. Would he not have said, <q>The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst; the young children ask for bread, but no man breaketh it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them?</q> 
               <q>They that did feed delicately, perish in the streets; they that were brought up in scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, embrace the dung.</q> What would he have said of rejected petitions, disregarded supplications, and contemned remonstrances? Would he not have said, "From hardness of heart, good Lord, deliver us?" What would he have said of a freeborn people butcheredâtheir towns desolated, and become an heap of ashesâtheir inhabitants become beggars, wanderers and vagabondsâby the cruel orders of an unrelenting tyrant, wallowing in luxury, and wantonly wasting the people's wealth, to oppress them the more? Would he not have said, it was oppression and ingratitude in the highest degree, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the oppression of the children of Israel? and, like Moses, have cried out, let the people go? Would he not have wondered at our patience and long-suffering, and have said, 'Tis time to change our master!â'Tis time to part!âAnd had he been an American born, would he not have shewed his wisdom by adopting the language of independency? Happy then for America in these fluctuating times, she is not without her Solomons, who see the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

As to the German forces, I have nothing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend from them; the parliament can soon pass an act against the introduction of foreign troops, exept the French or Spaniards, who can't be called foreign, they are our friends and nearest neighbours.

Are not the daily papers filled with treasonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves of American congresses and committees, extracts of letters, and other infamous pieces and scurrilous pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, circulating with unusual industry throughout the kingdom, by the enemies of Britain, thereby poisoning the minds of our liege subjects with their detestable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets?âAnd did you not this day see the procession, and that vile miscreant Lord Patriot at their head, going to St. James's with their remonstrance, in such state and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade as manifestly tended to provoke, challenge and defy majesty itself, and the powers of government? and yet nothing done to stop their pernicious effects.âSurely, my Lords and Gentlemen, you must agree with me, that it is now become highly expedient that an immediate stop should be put to such unwarrantable and dangerous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, by the most vigorous and coercive measures.</p>

                  <p>I entirely agree with your Lordship, and was ever firmly of opinion, that licentiousness of every kind, (particularly that of the Press) is dangerous to the state; the rabble should be kept in awe by examples of severity, and a proper respect should be enforced to supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors. I have sufficiently shewn my dislike to the freedom of the press, by the examples I have frequently made (tho' too favourable) of several printers, and others, who had greatly trespassed, and if they still persist, other measures should be taken with them, which the laws will point out; and as to Lord Patriot, he's a fellow that has been out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law'd, scandal proof, little to be got by meddling with him; I would advise to let him alone for the present, and humble America first.</p>

No, 'tis impossible!-View that arch-dragon, that old fiend, Paramount, that rebel in grain, whispering in his ear. View his wretched ministers hovering round him, to accomplish their accursed purpose, and accelerate his destructionâView the whole herd of administration (I know 'em well) and tell me if the world can furnish a viler set of miscreants? View both houses of parliament, and count the number of Tyrants, Jacobites, Tories, Placemen, Pensioners, Sycophants and Panders. View the constitution, is she not disrob'd and dismantled? is she not become like a virgin deflower'd? View our fleets and armies commanded by bloody murdering butchers!

                  <p>Gratitude, like religion and patriotism, are about taking their flight, and the law of the land stands on tiptoe; the constitution, that admirable fabric, that work of ages, the envy of the world, is deflower'd indeed, and made to commit a rape upon her own body, by the avaricious frowns of her own father, who is bound to protect her, not to destroyâHer pillars are thrown down, her capitals broke, her pedestals demolish'd and her foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation nearly destroy'd.âLord Paramount and his wretched adviser Mocklaw baffles all our efforts.âThe statutes of the land superseded by royal proclamations and dispensing powers, &amp;c. &amp;c. the bloody knife to be held to the throats of the Americans, and force them to submit to slav'ry.âAdministration have commenced bloody tyrants, and those that should protect the subject, are become their execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners; yet will I dispute with them inch by inch, while there's a statute book left in the land.

                  <p>Our friends must bestir themselves once more, perhaps we may yet turn the scale.âIf the voice of religion, wisdom and justice should fail, let us sound the trumpet of liberty and patriotism, that will conquer them in America, I know; let us try to storm them here with the united whole, and if by a base majority they still carry their point, we can nevertheless wash our hands and be clean.</p>

Hear now, O house of Britain, is it a small thing for you to weary man, but will you weary your God also? In the house of Lords have I borne my testimony: Hear now, O ye Princes, and I will yet declare in Britain, and shew forth in America, I will not cease 'till I bring about (if possible) unity, peace and concord.</p>

                  <p>Much to be wished for; but alas! I fear it's now too late; I foresee the tendency and consequence of those diabolical measures that have been pursued with unrelenting fury. Britain will ruin her trade, waste her wealth, her strength, her credit and her importance in the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014823_0024_0F973A2B8E1043F8"/>
scale of Europe. When a British king proves ungrateful and haughty, and strives to be independent of his people, (who are his sole support) the people will in their turn likewise strive to be independent of him and his myrmidons, and will be free; they will erect the anfractuous standard of independency, and thousands and tens of thousands will flock to it, and solace themselves under its shade.âThey have often been told of this, but affected to despise it; they know not America's strength, they are ignorant of it; fed by the flatt'ry of every sycophant tale, imagine themselves almighty, and able to subdue the whole world. America will be lost to Britain for ever, and will prove her downfall. America is wise, and will shake off the galling yoke before it be rivetted on them; they will be drove to it, and who can blame them? Who can blame a gally slave for making his escape?âBritain will miscarry in her vile projects, her knight errant, her Don Quixotte schemes in America: America will resist; they are not easily to be subdued; (nay 'tis impossible) Britain will find it a harder task than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer France and Spain united, and will cost 'em more blood and treasure than a twice seven years war with those European powers; they will stand out 'till Britons are tired. Britain will invite her with kind promises and open arms; America will reject them; America will triumph, rejoice and flourish, and become the glory of the earth; Britain will languidly hold down her head, and become first a prey to a vile Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I honour the plant, I revere the tree, and would cherish its branches. Let us, my friends, join hands with them, follow their example, and endeavour to support expiring liberty in Britain; whilst I have a tongue to speak, I will support her wherever found; whilst I have crutches to crawl with, I will try to find her out, and with the voice of an arch-angel will demand for a sacrifice to the nation those miscreants who have wickedly and wantonly been the ruin of their country.

I should not be at all surpris'd to hear of independency pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd throughout their land, of Britain's armies beat, their fleets burnt, sunk, or otherwise destroy'd. The same principle which Mr. Brazen speaks of, that inspires British soldiers to fight, namely the ferment of youthful blood, the high spirit of the people, a love of glory, and a sense of national honour, will inspire the Americans to withstand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>I have said and done all that man could say or do.â'Tis wrong, I insist upon it, and time will show it, to suffer them to take possession of Castle William and fortify Boston Neck.</p>

                  <p>I cannot see, good Sir, of what advantage it will be to them;âthey've only a mind, I suppose, to keep their soldiers from being inactive, which may prejudice their health.</p>

                  <p>I wish it may prove so, I would very gladly confess your superior knowledge in military manoeuvres; but till then, suffer me to tell you, it's a stroke the most fatal to us,âno less, Sir, but to cut off the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the town and country, making prisoners of us all by degrees, and give 'em an opportunity of making excursions, and in a short time subdue us without resistance.</p>

                  <p>Sir, my reason is not to be trifled with. Do you not see or hear ev'ry day of insults and provocations to the peaceable inhabitants? This is only a prelude. Can men of spirit bear forever with such usage? I know not what business they have here at all.</p>

                  <p>Nay, Sir, I know not their business;âlet us yet bear with them 'till we know the success of the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Congress;âif unfavourable, then it will be our time.</p>

                  <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                  <p>Whilst early looking, Dick, ere the sun was seen to tinge the brow of the mountain, for my flock of sheep, nor dreaming of approaching evil, suddenly mine eyes beheld from you hill a cloud of dust arise at a small distance; the intermediate space were thick set with laurels, willows, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greens, and bushes of various kinds, the growth of wild nature, and which hid the danger from my eyes, thinking perchance my flock had thither stray'd; I descended, and straight onward went; but, Dick, judge you my thoughts at such a disappointment: Instead of my innocent flock of sheep, I found myself almost encircled by a herd of ravenous British wolves.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dick.</speaker>
                  <p>Dangerous must have been your situation, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whatever were your thoughts.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                  <p>I soon discovered my mistake; finding a hostile appearance, I instantly turn'd myself about, and fled to alarm the shepherds.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dick.</speaker>
                  <p>Did they pursue you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                  <p>They did; but having the start, and being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the bye-ways, I presently got clear of their voracious jaws.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dick.</speaker>
                  <p>A lucky escape, indeed, Roger; and what rout did they take after that?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                  <p>Onwards, t'wards Lexington, devouring geese, cattle and swine, with fury and rage, which, no doubt, was increased by their disappointment; and what may appear strange to you, Dick, (tho' no more strange than true) is, they seem'd to be possessed of a kind of brutish music, growling something like our favourite tune Yankee Doodle, (perhaps in ridicule) 'till it were almost thread bare, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vastly pleased (monkey-like) with their mimickry, as tho' it provoked us much.</p>

                  <speaker>Dick.</speaker>
                  <p>Nature, Roger, has furnish'd some brute animals with voices, or, more properly speaking, with organs of sound that nearly resemble the human. I have heard of crocodiles weeping like a child, to decoy the unwary

traveller, who is no sooner within their reach, but they seize and devour instantly.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                  <p>Very true, Dick, I have read of the same; and these wolves, being of the canine breed, and having the properties of blood-hounds, no doubt are possess'd of a more acute sense of smelling, more reason, instinct, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity, or what shall I call it? than all other brutes. It might have been a piece of cunning of theirs, peculiar to them, to make themselves pass for shepherds, and decoy our flocks; for, as you know, Dick, all our shepherds both play and sing Yankee Doodle, our sheep and lambs are as well acquainted with that tune as ourselves, and always make up to us whene'er they hear the sound.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dick.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, Roger; and now you put me in mind of it I'll tell you of something surprising in my turn: I have an old ram and an old ewe, that, whenever they sing Yankee Doodle together, a skilful musician can scarcely distinguish it from the bass and tenor of an organ.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                  <p>Surprising indeed, Dick, nor do I in the least doubt it; and why not, as well as Balaam's ass, speak? and I might add, many other asses, now-a-days; and yet, how might that music be improved by a judicious disposition of its various parts, by the addition of a proper number of sheep and young lambs; 'twould then likewise resemble the counter, counter tenor, treble, and finest pipes of an organ, and might be truly called nature's organ; methinks, Dick, I could forever sit and hear such music,</p>

                  <p>Delightful, indeed; I'll attempt it with what little skill I have in music; we may then defy these wolves to imitate it, and thereby save our flocks: I am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, Roger, these wolves intended it rather as a decoy than by way of ridicule, because they live by cunning and deception; besides, they could never mean to ridicule a piece of music, a tune, of which such brutes cannot be supposed to be judges, and, which is allowed by the best masters of music to be a composition of the most sublime kind, and would have done honour to a Handel or a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellius. Well, go on, Roger, I long to hear the whole.</p>

                  <p>Not content with this, their murdering leaders, with premeditated malice, keen appetite, and without provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, gave the howl for the onset, when instantly the whole herd, as if the devil had entered into them, ran violently down the hill, and fixed their talons and jaws upon them, and as quick as lightening eight innocent young lambs fell a sacrifice to their fury, and victims to their rapacity; the very houses of our God were no longer a sanctuary; many they tore to pieces, and some at the very foot of the altar; others were dragged out as in a wanton gamesome mood.</p>

                  <p>Our numbers increasing, and arm'd with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, we in our turn play'd the man; they, unus'd to wounds, with hideous yelling soon betook themselves to a precipitate and confused flight, nor did we give o'er the chase, 'till Phoebus grew drowsy, bad us desist, and wished us a good night.</p>

                  <p>Of some part of their hasty retreat I was a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful spectator, I saw their tongues lolling out of their mouths, and heard them pant like hunted wolves indeed.</p>

                  <p>Did you not hear how their mirth was turn'd into mourning? their fury into astonishment? how soon they quitted their howling Yankee Doodle, and chang'd their notes to bellowing? how nimbly (yet against their will) they betook themselves to dancing? And he was then the bravest dog that beat time the swiftest, and footed Yankee Doodle the nimblest.</p>

                  <p>Well pleased, Roger, was I with the chace, and glorious sport it was: I oft perceiv'd them tumbling o'er each other heels over head; nor did one dare stay to help his brotherâbut, with bloody breech, made the best of his wayânor ever stopped 'till they were got safe within their lurking-holesâ</p>

                  <p>May this be the fate of all those prowling sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stealers; it behooves the shepherds to double the watch, to take uncommon precaution and care of their tender flocks, more especially as this is like to be an uncommon severe winter, by the appearance of wolves so early in the seasonâbut, hark!âRoger, methinks I hear the sound of melody warbling thro' the groveâLet's sit a while, and partake of it unseen.</p>

                  <p>With all my heart.âMost delightful harmony! This is the First of May; our shepherds and nymphs are celebrating our glorious St. Tammany's day; we'll hear the song out, and then join in the frolick, and chorus it o'er and o'er againâThis day shall be devoted to joy and festivity.</p>
