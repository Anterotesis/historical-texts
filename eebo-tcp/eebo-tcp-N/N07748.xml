            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> Auguſt 22, 1764, taken from the <hi>London Chronicle</hi> No. 1223.</head>
            <p>OUR Indian War ſtill greatly diſtreſſes our Frontier Counties, great Numbers are driven from their Habitations, and Want and Poverty force many to live on their Plantations, tho' they never go to Bed without Danger of being cut off by the Savages before the Morning. This was the Fate of ſome Families lately, who were our Neighbours and intimate Friends ſome Years ago, while they lived in the interior Counties. They murdered a Woman with Child, cut the Infant out of her Womb, and made her and it moſt horrid Spectales of their Cruelty. They alſo, not many Weeks ago, ſtole down thro' the Inhabitants and maſſacred a Schoolmaſter and his Scholars in a moſt barbarous Manner. Theſe Murders are generally committed by Indians who lived either near or among the Europeans in the Time of Peace; they know the State of the Frontiers, and how to diſtreſs them, and ſteal off without Diſcovery. Theſe Indians are the Remains of a Part of the Indian Nation from whom we bought our Lands. They are a free independent People; they are no Subjects of England, as ſome believe, nor did they ever give up their National Independency; they have been in Alliance with England, but ſtill have all the Powers of a free Nation, and make War and Peace with us, as with others, as they pleaſe. The Quakers are chiefly in our three interior Counties, as they were the firſt Settlers; and the five Frontier Counties are ſettled in general with People of other Denominations, chiefly Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, and Dutch and Engliſh Presbyterians, with a Mixture of Baptiſts and the Church of England. In all our Troubles the Quakers, at leaſt a Quaker Faction, have ſecretly ſupported the Indians, held Treaties and Correſpondence with them in our Wars, and beſtowed on them Arms and Ammunition, and Tomahawks, even when they were murdering our Frontier Inhabitants. When a Peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, if we may uſe an Indian Idiom, they wiped away the Blood ſhed by the Indians without obliging them to return our Captives. We put 500 l. into the Hands of our Governor, who entruſted it to our Provincial Commiſſioners, to redeem our Captives ſo ſhamefully deſerted; but we did not receive above a Score, if ſo many, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our utmoſt Endeavours. The very Indians who lived among us, and had done us great Miſchiefs, during the War, ſat in the Council with the Nations to whom they belonged, and concluded this Peace: And even in Time of Peace, before this War broke out, they told the Inhabitants among whom they lived, that they had
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:009892_0004_0F7AD578A9EEAE20"/>
ſcalped and carried them into Captivity, and would do it again. The War broke out, and in a few Days above 750 Families were driven from their peaceable Habitations, were forced to adandon their Cattle, Crops, and Houſhold Furniture, nay many were glad to eſcape with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bringing Bed <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ths and wearing Apparel with them, and they lived in Wig-wams like the Indians, hardly ſheltered from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clemency of the Weather. When ready to periſh for want of the Neceſſaries of Life, our Society ſent them 150 l. as we wrote you Word; and ſoon after Collections were made by every Religious Society in this City (the Quakers only excepted) tho' they were earneſtly preſſed to contribute to their Relief: Even the Roman Catholics, unaſked, generouſly made a Collection for their Relief. You deſired to know the Reaſon why the Quakers were ſo backward, I really can give none that they have aſſigned, ſave this, that they knew other Societies would relieve them, and they would afterwards aſſiſt, if there was occaſion; but had all taken this cold Method, many of them muſt have periſhed; and tho' their Diſtreſſes are ſtill great, and tho' it is acknowledged even in our Aſſembly, that 100,000 l. would not pay their Loſſes, yet they would do Nothing then, nor now, to help them: Yet, during the laſt War, they expended 5000 l. in Preſents to the Indians, while they were drenching our Frontier Settlements in the Blood of the diſtreſſed Inhabitants. We know no Reaſon for this Conduct, but an envious Temper, becauſe the Frontier Counties, who are of different Denominations, muſt ſhare the Power with them, that they now abuſe; and to prevent this, they have, in forming the new Counties, ordered it ſo, that but ten Repreſentatives are ſent from five Frontier Counties, and twenty-ſix are ſent from the three Interior Counties, under the Quakers Influence. Theſe Frontier Inhabitants complain that they are not fairly repreſented, or elſe they had not been ſuch Sufferers; and as the Charter allows every County at leaſt four to repreſent them, they deſire this Charter Privilege; and this occaſions, as far as I can judge, all our Quakers Uncharitableneſs. No Men were ever fonder of Power. The Frontier Inhabitants expoſed to daily Incurſions of the Indians, formed a Party of Volunteers to go and deſtroy ſome Indian Town, near our Borders, on Suſquehanna; accordingly 116 Men marched almoſt to their Towns, and were informed that 50 of thoſe Indians, againſt whom they had ſet out, were on their March againſt the Frontiers. They returned and overtook the Indians, and routed them at the Munſey Hill on Suſquehanna. They then propoſed to follow their Blow, and applied to Colonel Armſtrong, who commanded the Provincial Forces. Two Hundred Volunteers went out with him, and 150 Provincials; but the Indians among us gave Notice to our Enemies, and they eſcaped; but our People deſtroyed about 300 Acres of Corn, and burnt their Dwellings, and returned enraged to find that an Indian Town of about twenty or thirty Perſons had now informed their Friends, againſt whom our Men had marched, and
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:009892_0005_0F7AD5790FE1DF48"/>
who were perfidiouſly playing the ſame Pranks as they did laſt War; they marched to their Town and cut off ſome of them, others fled to a Borough named Lancaſter, and there they came and cut them off. This the Quakers have painted as a Maſſacre and a moſt horrid Murder, tho' it was no more but what our People ſuffered on all Occaſions. After their Corn was deſtroyed, and that troubleſome Neſt were obliged to remove, a Party of Indians among the Inhabitants that carried the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Arms and Ammunition, and had conducted them into the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and aſſiſted in murdering the Inhabitants, applied to the Quakers, and they found Means to bring them down to Philadelphia, and have maintained them at the Expence of the Province. Afterwards ſome of the very Indians that were beat at the Munſey Hill, and that had their Corn deſtroyed, ſued for the ſame Privileges, and were brought to Philadelphia, and maintained by the Province. This inflamed the Reſentment of a Number of the Inhabitants on the Frontiers, and about 500 came down well armed, without forming themſelves into Companies, determined to cut off theſe Enemies. The Indians were then under the Governor's Protection, and at the Requeſt of the Quaker Faction were guarded by a Company of the King's Forces. Theſe Inſurgents declared they were Loyal Subjects, and had fought the King's Battles ſince Braddock's Defeat, and would not do what looked like Rebellion, tho' they thought it exceeding hard that they ſhould be obliged to pay Taxes to maintain their Enemies. They complained of Grievances and Sufferings that would have drawn Tears from Stones; the Mayor of our City, two leading Members of the Aſſembly, and the King's Attorney-General, and about ten Miniſters and Gentlemen, were at the Conference, and they were ſolemnly promiſed a Redreſs of Grievances, if they appointed two of their Number to lay them before the Governor and Aſſembly, and returned in Peace to their Dwellings: This they did; and marched Abroad and Home with Decency above 100 Miles, paying every One for what they had on their Journey. But they are ſtill without Redreſs of their Grievances. This has inflamed the Quaker Faction, who are fooliſhly attached to the Indians, and is made a Plea for with-holding their Charity. We have been able to do Nothing to ſpread the Goſpel either among the Indians or the Europeans ſince the War broke out: We have aſſiſted and are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to aſſiſt the diſtreſſed Inhabitants; and we rejoice that thro' your Liberality, a kind Providence has enabled us at any Time, when their Diſtreſſes grow very great, to give them Relief.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>REVEREND SIRS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN the London Chronicle, No. 1223, is a very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Letter, dated at <hi>Philadelphia, Auguſt</hi> 22, 1764, which, tho' not ſign'd with your Names, carries evident Marks of your being the Authors. I confeſs it gave me real Concern to find that Men of your holy Function, could cooly and deliberately publiſh to the World ſo many defamatory Untruths, as that Letter contains, againſt a Society of People, whoſe Merit and virtuous Demeanor, ever ſince the Settlement of the Colony, had gain'd them the Confidence and Eſteem or the Publick. You have therein endeavoured to make the prudent Policy of the Government appear criminal, by wickedly miſrepreſenting its Tranſactions; and, having done this, you impute the imaginary Crimes to the <hi>Quakers</hi> with the uncharitable Deſign of rendering their Conduct obnoxious to their Sovereign and odious to Mankind.</p>
            <p>WITH this View it is, you alledge,
<q>That the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers have <hi>ſecretly</hi> ſupported the Indians, held Treaties and Correſpondence with them, in our Wars, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on them <hi>Arms and Ammunition and Tomhawks,</hi> even when they were murdering our Frontier Inhabitants.</q>
I am at a Loſs what Words to uſe in remarking on this Charge. I am not fond of uſing harſh Ones, and yet when the Manner of making it, and the Heinouſneſs of
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:009892_0007_0F7AD57A479FDBC8"/>
the Accuſation is conſidered, every honeſt Mind muſt determine none can be found too ſevere. The Charge is general, and in the Affirmative, and therefore by the Policy and Reaſon of all Laws ought to be proved before it is credited; otherwiſe the moſt abandoned Wretch, may at any Time take the Life, and ruin the Reputation, of the moſt innocent and virtuous on his bare Aſſertion. And indeed, a great Writer obſerves, that a general Charge in a Libel ought not to be credited, tho' it was ſupported by the Oath of the Libeller. The Laws of the Land are made to puniſh Offenders, and no one ought to be publickly diſgraced before he has had an Opportunity of vindicating his Innocence. The Crime you accuſe this People with is <hi>High Treaſon.</hi> The Courts of Juſtice have ever been open to receive your Informations againſt them, and the Government ready to inflict the Puniſhment on Men that deſerve it. Had you then the leaſt Proof of the Facts, What Reaſon can be given, why the ſame Malice and Ill-will have not prompted you to bring them to Juſtice, which induced you thus publickly to defame them in your Letter? Your Duty to the Community, and your Loyalty to your Sovereign, ſhould have incited you to the Firſt: The Rules of Morality and the Precepts of the Religion you profeſs and publickly teach, ſhould have deter'd you from the other. How then ſhall we account for this Breach of the Duties of Morality and Religion? Why did you not make this Charge before ſome proper Judicatory, inſtead of publiſhing it in a Libel? It muſt be becauſe you were conſcious it ſprung from the wicked Invention of your own Brains, and therefore impoſſible to be ſupported.</p>
            <p>BUT permit me to aſk you, <hi>when, where,</hi> and <hi>how</hi> was this heinous Offence againſt your Sovereign and the Government committed by the Quakers? If you cannot tell the <hi>Time, Place,</hi> or the <hi>Manner,</hi> were you, or ten Thouſand like you, to make the Charge even upon Oath, you muſt not expect to be credited—And if you can give
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:009892_0008_0F7AD57C4C711AB8"/>
ſuch Information, how dare you conceal an Offence of High Treaſon from the Goverment? Is your Loyalty ſo faint, and your Virtue ſo low, as not to be powerful enough to prevail on you to diſcharge your Duty to your King and your Country?</p>
            <p>AFTER making this Charge againſt the Quakers in general, you deſcend to ſay, "at leaſt a Quaker Faction" have done this. Pray inform us how many compoſe this Faction? If they are numerous, it affords you a better Opportunity of fixing it on ſome of them, and of bringing them to Juſtice. If a few, how baſe and wicked is it in you, Reverend Sirs, to endeavour from the Crimes of a few Individuals, ſuppoſing your Accuſation to be juſt, to calumniate the Reputation of a whole Society? Fifty Seven Preſbyterian Ruffians attacked the Indians, the antient <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Allies</hi> of the Engliſh, who had been long <hi>peaceably</hi> ſettled at <hi>Coneſtogo,</hi> a Place far within the inhabited Parts, and barbarouſly murdered in cool Blood, diſarmed Men, helpleſs Women, and innocent Infants, when on their bended Knees proteſting their Innocence, and with uplifted Hands imploring their Lives. Now, would you think it juſt in the Quakers to impute theſe horrid Deeds to your whole Society, and publiſh them to the World in the London Chronicle? I am ſure you would not.—But why then, Reverend Sirs, have you ſo widely deviated from that golden Rule, <hi>Do unto others as you would they ſhould do unto you?</hi> Think of this Queſtion—Think ſeriouſly of it on your Pillows— think of it in your Pulpit and when at Prayers; and, if no Remorſe or Penitence is the Effect of your Reflections, your Hearts muſt be harder than the <hi>Nether Mill-ſtone.</hi> For it is written,

It was the Folly and Raſhneſs of <hi>one Man,</hi> that furniſhed them with the Means of giving their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentations of the Conduct of the Aſſembly an Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Truth, at a Time when the Houſe had given the moſt evident Proof of their Obedience to the Royal Orders.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009892_0010_0F7AD57DB6ED5B08"/>
And it is this officious, miſcheivous and ambitious Man, againſt whom alone you have heretofore made the Charges, which you now impute to the Society,
<q>of holding Treaties and Correſpondence with the Indians, and beſtowing on them Tomhawks in Time of War,</q>
—with how much Juſtice and Truth, you and he alone can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. The Dexterity and Succeſs with which you and your Party have uſed the Follies of this Man, to abuſe and diſcredit the Society he unhappily belongs to, are now fatally notorious. The Taſk of reciting all the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs which he has brought on the Society, the Diſgrace he has, and is continually ſubjecting them to, his wild Schemes to promote his own Importance, the Numbers his abſurd Conduct has driven from the Society, and the other Effects of his fickle, yet headſtrong impetuous Temper, would take up more Time than I can at preſent ſpare: I ſhall therefore only add, that Confuſion and Diſcredit have conſtantly attended the Affairs of thoſe who have had any Connections with him; and that it would have been happy for the Society, and the Liberties of Pennſylvania, if they had never had any Fellowſhip with a Perſon of his Diſpoſition: For your Malevolence will never want a plauſible Pretext for Miſrepreſentation and Slander againſt the <hi>whole Society,</hi> while he continues a Member, and your Conſciences will permit you to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the Follies of an <hi>Individual</hi> into heinous Crimes, and to impute them to the Society in general, who either never thought of them or gave them Oppoſition.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now leave this high Charge againſt the Quakers, which, without one probable Circumſtance attending it, reſted ſolely on your meer Aſſertion. And how much Credit ought to be given to that, I ſhall make evident before I conclude.</p>
            <p>THERE are ſome Men who, determined to ſucceed in their Deſigns, are utterly regardleſs of Truth, and ſo indifferent to the Shame of being detected in a Falſehood; that they never reflect whether the Facts they affirm are
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009892_0011_0F7AD57E0A157390"/>
true or falſe. This Part you have acted; being determined at all Events, to deſtroy the Reputation of the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT when I conſider the <hi>Falſehoods</hi> you, and your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, have had the Hardineſs to publiſh, with this Intent, even upon the Spot where they might be eaſily detected, I the leſs admire at your Wickedneſs in publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your venomous Slanders in England, where they might chance not to fall in the Hands of thoſe who were able to refute them. In ſome of your inflammatory Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations you did not ſcruple to aſſert, that the Aſſembly had employed the Publick Money in hiring the Indians to deſtroy the back Inhabitants. But tho' the Author of the <hi>Preface</hi> to Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi>'s Speech, ſoon after tax'd you with downright <hi>Lying</hi> on the Occaſion, you have never thought fit to deny the Charge, nor indeed will you ever be able to wipe off the Infamy with which you have thereby covered yourſelves. I muſt beg Leave, however, to repeat ſome of that Author's Words, as I think them very expreſſive of your Conduct.
<q>Are there not, ſays he, Pamphlets continually written and daily ſold in our Streets to juſtify and encourage a Spirit of Riot and Violence? —Are not the mad armed Mob in thoſe Writings inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to imbrue their Hands in the Blood of their Fellow Citizens;—by firſt applauding their Murder of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and then repreſenting the Aſſembly and their Friends as worſe than <hi>Indians,</hi> as having privately ſtirr'd up the <hi>Indians</hi> to murder the white People, and arm'd and rewarded them for that Purpoſe?—LIES, Gentlemen, villainous as ever the Malice of Hell invented; and which to do you Juſtice, not one of you believes,—tho' you would have the Mob believe them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To proceed,—In hopes that ſome of your ſlanderous Slime might ſtick, you wickedly aſſert, That
<q>when a Peace was concluded, they (the Quakers) wiped away the Blood ſhed by the Indians without obliging them to return our Captives;</q>
confeſſing at the ſame Time that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009892_0012_0F7AD57ED23DA1C8"/>
the <hi>wiping away</hi> the Blood is an "Indian Idiom" for making of Peace. I ſay you have <hi>wickedly</hi> aſſerted this, as I am convinced that you muſt at the very Time have known, that the Meſſages of Invitation to the Indians were ſent by the <hi>Governor;</hi> that the Negotiations were conducted by <hi>him,</hi> with the <hi>Advice</hi> of his <hi>Council;</hi> that the Peace was concluded, or the Blood <hi>wiped away</hi> as you term it, by the <hi>ſame Authority;</hi> and that the few Quakers who attended the Treaty, were never conſulted on the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and even the Provincial Commiſſioners were but ſeldom treated with that Reſpect. Had either of theſe been the Caſe, the Meaſure you complain of would have been at leaſt recommended.—If this Step was prudent or neceſſary, it was the Province of the <hi>Governor,</hi> and thoſe who had the Management of the Treaty under their Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to inſiſt on and enforce it. And, if any Perſons are culpable, they muſt be thoſe whoſe Duty it was to obtain a Reſtitution of the Captives, and not thoſe who had the Inclination without the Power. But if, Reverend Sirs, it was your Opinion, that it was the Duty of others, beſides the executive Part of Government
<q>to oblige the Indians to return our Captives</q>
why did <hi>you</hi> not perform this important Service? It was <hi>as much</hi> in <hi>your Power</hi> as in that of the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and ſome of you actually attended the Treaty. Was it becauſe you at that Time had really but little Concern about the Captives? Or was it becauſe you had not then reſolved to lay aſide the arduous Duties of your ſacred Offices, for the Sake of Politics and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Politicians?—Give me leave to tell you ſeriouſly, that the Zeal you, and thoſe you can influence, have lately ſhown in vilifying the <hi>Quakers,</hi> is thought, by the ſenſible moderate Men of every Perſuaſion in the Province, to be owing to your <hi>political Deſigns.</hi> It is imagined, that you expect you ſhall, by rendering the Quakers odious, recommend yourſelves to the Proprietors, and thereby the eaſier engroſs all Power, and reduce all other Societies, the Church of England not excepted, to your Will and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009892_0013_0F7AD57F8F7BE5D0"/>
Pleaſure, as your Society have in a great Degree already done in ſeveral other of his Majeſty's Colonies.</p>
            <p>IN the next Sentence you tell us, that you
<q>put £. 500, into the Hands of the Governor, who entruſted it to the Provincial Commiſſioners, to redeem our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſo ſhamefully deſerted.</q>
I am obliged to you, Gentlemen, for this Diſcovery. It ſeems then that the Authors of ſo many bold Untruths and uncharitable Cenſures, as are contained in the Letter before me, are the ſame Perſons who gave into the Governor's Hands £. 500, for the Redemption of Captives.—And when I have Recourſe to the Receipt ſigned by the Governor for that Money, I find it was paid by the Corporation for the Relief of Preſbyterian Miniſters, their Widows and Children,—not out of your private Purſes, or from any Contributions of your Society in this Province, as you have left the World to conclude; but from the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Donations of the good People of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> for this <hi>very Purpoſe,</hi> and not for the Purpoſe to which you have applied the Bulk of thoſe Donations. Wherein then does your <hi>Charity</hi> conſiſt? Is it in abuſing your Neighbours, and aſſuming the <hi>Charity</hi> of <hi>others</hi> to <hi>yourſelves?</hi> But are you not yet aſhamed to keep the <hi>Amount</hi> of this Donation a <hi>Secret</hi> from the World—and not give an Account thereof either to the Contributors in Europe, or to the People of this Province? The firſt have a Right to expect it, becauſe the Money was theirs, and it was given by them on this expreſs Condition; and the latter, becauſe it was given to relieve them from an Expence which otherwiſe they muſt have neceſſarily provided for.</p>
            <p>And are you not alſo aſhamed to ſay, that the Governor entruſted the Money to the <hi>Provincial Commiſſioners;</hi> when you know in your own Conſciences, that they never received a ſingle Farthing, or had the leaſt Direction in the Diſpoſal of it; but that it was entruſted by Governor <hi>Hamilton,</hi> to two Gentlemen of <hi>your own Religion,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:009892_0014_0F7AD5810976C290"/>
for the Purpoſes you intended it, and for which they are accountable to the Governor? To prove that you muſt have been conſcious of this, and, that the
<q>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives were not ſo ſhamefully deſerted</q>
by the <hi>Publick</hi> as you repreſent, but that their not being relieved, was owing to a ſudden Turn of Indian Affairs; I ſhall inſert a Copy of a Note ſent by one of you to the Secretary, and by him laid before the Commiſſioners. viz.</p>

                  <p>Dr. Aliſon preſents his Compliments to Mr. Secretary <hi>Shippen,</hi> and ſends him a Copy of the Minute relating to the Money allotted to the Redemption and Relief of Captives, together with a Copy of the Receipt Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> gave for the ſame. He would obſerve on this Matter, that the Money was <hi>joined</hi> with ſome <hi>Publick</hi> Money, put into the Hands of Commiſſioners, ſent to <hi>Pittſburgh,</hi> to forward down, and to relieve the Captives expected to be reſtored by the Indians, <hi>in Conſequence of the Treaty of</hi> Lancaſter.—But as from the <hi>unſucceſsful Turn Indian Affairs took, little Room was afforded to lay out the ſame;</hi> it is expected that moſt of this Sum, lies yet unapplied.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Province Commiſſioners</hi> think fit to lay it out for the Relief of the Poor People, who have been delivered up to Colonel <hi>Bouquet,</hi> and will render ſuch particular Accounts of the ſame, with former Diſtributions and Diſburſements, as may ſatisfy the Donors, or otherwiſe if they will return the Money to be laid out by thoſe who advanced it, they will either Way give Satisfaction.</p>

            <p>IN all this Time, it ſeems you have diſpoſed of but £. 500, and you have lately requeſted the Governor and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Commiſſioners to ſettle the Accounts thereof. What the Amount of the Collection was is uncertain to us; it may have been £. 5000, or more.—You have confeſſed there is a Ballance remaining in your Hands; which to be ſure you will not venture to appropriate to any other

than the Purpoſes intended by the Contributors, without their Aſſent.—If this be really your Deſign, Might you not as well have laid before the ſame Gentlemen, the whole Accounts of this charitable Donation, containing the Amount thereof, the Sums you have expended, and the Ballance now remaining in your Hands? This would be acting the Part of Men of Honour and Honeſty. It would give the Contributors in England the Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the are entitled to, which they have often complained of the Want of; and which they will undoubtedly find out Meaſures to compel you to do, ſhould you trifle with them much longer.</p>
            <p>I will follow you ſtill further in your boaſted Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities to the back Inhabitants.
<q>When ready to periſh for want of the Neceſſaries of Life," you ſay, "our Society ſent them £. 150, and ſoon after Collections were made by every Religious Society in this City, the Quakers only excepted.</q>
It is not my Inclination to depreciate from the Charities of any Religious Society; nor would I willingly employ my Pen to ſo odious and unchriſtian a Purpoſe. This kind of Work, I would chuſe to leave to ſuch Lovers of Defamation and Falſehood as are the Authors of the Letter in queſtion. I have Reaſon to know, that there are many worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and Loyal Subjects among the Preſbyterians in this Province; and I am confident there would be yet many more, had you confined yourſelves to the Duties of your ſacred Functions, and never dabbled in Politicks. A Science you do not underſtand; or did you, you could not put your Knowledge in Practice, conſiſtent with your Stations in Life, and the Offices you have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. The Influence you have among your People in the City, the Authority you have aſſumed over all the Preſbyterian Clergy, and their Congregations in the Country, to which the Majority of them implicitly ſubmit, as is plain by the ready Obedience they paid to your <hi>Circular Letter,</hi> deſcribing the Change from a
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009892_0016_0F7AD581C79FEB68"/>
Proprietary to a Royal Government, as productive of their <hi>Ruin,</hi> and the great Induſtry and Pains you have taken to render the latter <hi>odious,</hi> muſt have had ſome Effect with them, and cooled, if not totally alienated the Affections of many from the Perſon of their Sovereign. For this Peice of Service, his Majeſty and Miniſtry have few others to reward but yourſelves, and a noted <hi>Church of England</hi> Clergyman, who has by uncommon Effrontery repeatedly impoſed on the Clergy of Eminence in our Mother Country.—But it is more than probable, that the Time is near when you will all be ſtripp'd of your borrowed Plumes.—Pardon this Diſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>IT is I ſay, a Taſk no ways agreeable to me, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Conduct of different religious Societies: And yet when the Slanders publiſhed by the Miniſters of one Sect, render the Compariſon neceſſary for the Vindication of another, there needs but little Apology. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lay before you, thoſe Sums of Money which the Quakers have generouſly beſtowed on the Frontier Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants to relieve their Diſtreſs, and to reſtore Peace to our Borders in which thoſe poor People were ſo much intereſted.</p>
            <p>IN the Year 1755, the Quakers, affected with the Diſtreſſes of the Frontier Inhabitants, who were then attacked by the French and Indians, were the <hi>only</hi> People that ſent them any Relief.—They raiſed in the City of Philadelphia, upwards of Five Hundred Pounds, and faithfully diſtributed it among them.—The Friends in the Country alſo join'd in this Charity, and diſpatched ſeveral Waggon Loads of Proviſions for the Subſiſtence of thoſe who were rendered deſtitute of the Neceſſaries of Life. Who were to be relieved?—not Quakers, for you agree the Quakers are chiefly in the three interior Cities. They were People of other Societies, and principally of your own. At this Time your Bowels of Compaſſion were not even moved,—all your Charity lay faſt aſleep!—What a grateful Return have you then made for this early and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009892_0017_0F7AD584C9A36C28"/>
ſeaſonable Act of Benevolence! For their Charity you have given them Abundence of Slander and Abuſe—And for Brotherly Love and Good Will towards your Society, you have endeavoured to ruin their Reputation as a People with all Mankind.</p>
            <p>AND, at the very Time you ſent up the £. 150, you mention, to the Frontiers, the Quakers in the Country Meetings alſo made Collections for the ſame Purpoſe, and ſent up ſeveral Sums of Money to relieve the Diſtreſſes of the poor People; and you have acknowleged in one of your former Publications, that ſome
<q>worthy Individuals (among the Quakers) in the City, contributed on the Occaſion.</q>
It is true, the Quakers as a Society, did not at this Time raiſe any Money in the City.—Their Reaſons were,—That the Application for Relief was firſt made to other Societies—to whom it came naturally firſt, as their People were the Objects in Diſtreſs. However, the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in the City, had a Meeting on the Occaſion, and upon Enquiry, found that the Sums of Money which had been already collected were ſo liberal, that they were more than ſufficient to anſwer the preſent Purpoſe.— And ſo it afterwards proved; for a Part of the Money ſent up to Cumberland and other Places, remained in the Hands of the Perſons to whom ſent, <hi>undiſtributed</hi> for <hi>many Months</hi> after.—And yet this did not prevent their reſolving (as appears by their Minutes) that they would largely contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute in the <hi>Winter</hi> Seaſon, when in all Probability, the Diſtreſſes of the Frontiers would demand much greater Relief.—In Purſuance of this Reſolution, it is well known upwards of £. 500, was ſubſcribed, a Part of it diſpoſed of, and a Part remains for want of Objects: As does likewiſe a great Part of the Money raiſed ſeveral Years before by your Miſſionary in Europe for the ſame Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>THESE were the only Motives that prevented the Quakers from contributing at this Time, as they had done before, to the Relief of the Frontiers. To have added to the Sums then raiſed for this Purpoſe, would
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009892_0018_0F7AD5858AF5D8E0"/>
have been Wantoneſs, not Charity, would have ſavoured more of Pride than Prudence. But any Reaſon ſuited your Purpoſe better than the true One, as you were determined to defame a whole Society of People, the Objects of your Envy and inveterate Malice, which was out of your Power to do, while you adhered to Truth. You therefore after racking your Invention to find out a Falſehood to ſerve your Purpoſe, aſſert,
<q>We know of no other Reaſon for this Conduct but an <hi>envious Temper,</hi> becauſe the Frontier Counties who are of different Denominations, muſt ſhare the <hi>Power</hi> with them which they now <hi>abuſe.</hi>
               </q>
It ſeems then the Quakers have <hi>Power.</hi> And permit me to aſk you why ſhould they not? Are they not in every Reſpect as much entitled to it as any others?—Have they not Life, Liberty and Property to be repreſented and protected as well as others? And have they not given as full Proof of a faithful and loyal Attachment to their Sovereign and his Government as thoſe of any other Society, and much more than thoſe of your own who have been under your particular Influence? It is true, you have taken great Pains to repreſent the People of that Society as principled againſt granting Aids to the Crown, and againſt paying the Taxes for the Defence of the Province. You have made Uſe of a Petition preſented to the Aſſembly, ſet on foot by a miſchievous wrongheaded Man among them, who, with all his Art and Influence, could obtain but 29 Perſons beſides himſelf to ſign it; and you have baſely impoſed it on the World as an Act of the whole Society, tho' you well knew that the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, even when compoſed of a great Majority of Quakers, have granted ſeveral Hundred Thouſand Pounds to the Crown, for thoſe very Purpoſes. You have alſo taken Advantage of the Conduct of the ſame obſtinate Perſon, in refuſing to pay his Taxes; tho' you knew there were not one in a Thouſand of that Society, but paid them with as much Chearfulneſs as any of the King's Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:009892_0019_0F7AD58648D907A8"/>GREAT as your Enmity is to Quakers, you cannot, Rev. Sirs, charge that Sect with having ever attempted to behead or depoſe their Sovereign, or with treaſonable Conſpiracies, Murders, Riots, or illegal Oppoſition to Government. On the contrary, it is well known to the World, that this Province was firſt ſettled by Quakers; it's Government carried on, and it's Peace and Welfare promoted, by Meaſures founded on Wiſdom and Prudence; the beſt Legiſlative Regulations were made, and Juſtice adminiſtred with the ſtricteſt Rectitude at Home, while Peace and Amity were carefully cultivated with the Natives abroad; and thoſe very Indians, whoſe Intereſt it was to deſtroy the White People, were, by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate Policy, made inſtrumental in promoting the Settlement and Welfare of the Colony. And the ſame Policy had ſtill continued, and the Happineſs of the People been equally promoted, had not Proprietary pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſt interfered and prevented.</p>
            <p>PERMIT me, before I leave this Point, to contraſt the Conduct of the Quakers with your own, and thoſe under your Influence. The Quakers have ever virtuouſly exerted themſelves in favour of the juſt Rights and Liberties of Mankind, and have endeavoured to reſtrain the Proprietary Power within its proper Bounds: You, on the other Hand, have join'd with that Power, in the fooliſh and vain Expectation of uſurping the Whole.—The Quakers have ever ſupported the Government, its Laws and Conſtitution, and that againſt all rebellious Riots and Attempts to tread it under Foot: You, and thoſe under your Influence, have been either the Principals or Abettors of all the Riots that have been inſolently raiſed in Defiance of Government and its Laws, as your many inſidious Writings, and the Letter now before me will teſtify. The Quakers, at the Requeſt of the Government, united with others in defending it againſt the Rioters: But the Congregation under your Care, one or two at moſt excepted, were either paſſive,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009892_0020_0F7AD58728EC5568"/>
if not joyful Spectators of the imminent Danger, or intermixed with them, abetting and encouraging their horrid Deſign. The Quakers, when they found Life, Liberty and Property were no longer ſecure under a P—y Government, did, from a <hi>perfect Confidence</hi> in their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> unite in petitioning for a <hi>Royal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> while you were employed in ſpreading <hi>Diſaffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> and an <hi>Averſion</hi> to a <hi>Kingly Government</hi> among your whole People; and in prevailing not only on the Men, but even Children at School to petition againſt it.—The Quakers have expended many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds towards reſtoring Peace to, and relieving the Diſtreſſes of the Frontier Inhabitants, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Captives, tho' ſcarcely any of their Society are ſettled there; while you have only contributed a pitiful £. 150, for one of theſe Purpoſes, tho' the People of your Society were the very Objects that were to be benefited and relieved. Thus, Reverend Sirs, had you the leaſt Degree of Candor, you would confeſs, that the Quakers have uniformly ſhewn by their Actions that they are govern'd by the Principles of Reaſon, and are Friends to good Government: That while they have with Steadineſs promoted the true Intereſt and Happineſs of the Country, and oppoſed the arbitrary and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Meaſures of a private Subject, they have at the ſame Time exerted themſelves in maintaining and defending even the Government that was occaſionally oppreſſing them, againſt every audacious Attempt that has been made to deſtroy its Laws, and annihilate its Power. And, to do you Juſtice, Gentlemen, I muſt confeſs, you have not been leſs uniform in the Execution of your Plan of trampling on all Government and Order: For it is well known it was thoſe under the Influence of one of you, that formed the Riot in Gov. <hi>Morris</hi>'s Adminiſtration, which was intended to intimidate the Aſſembly into the arbitrary and unjuſt Meaſures of the Proprietaries.—It was People of the ſame Society, that perpetrated the Murders at
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009892_0021_0F7AD588632924F8"/>
               <hi>Coneſtogoe</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> which you can, conſiſtent with your Religion, even endeavour to juſtify. It was the ſame People that committed that daring Inſult on the Government at <hi>Germantown,</hi> and have ſince that ſeized and deſtroyed <hi>the Goods of the</hi> CROWN, and impudently declared, "that they were <hi>better Judges</hi> of what was right to be done in America, than their <hi>Sovereign</hi> and the <hi>Britiſh Parliament</hi> united." You formerly join'd with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietaries againſt the Aſſembly, contrary to your own and the Rights of your Fellow Subjects, and you now unite with the ſame Power againſt the Rights of His Majeſty himſelf. Uniformly you have acted indeed, but with how much Reputation and Credit to yourſelves and your Society, the candid Part of Mankind will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after determine.</p>
            <p>BUT this Want of Charity in the Quakers proceeds as you alledge from an
<q>
                  <hi>envious Temper,</hi> becauſe the Frontier Inhabitants muſt ſhare the Power with them.</q> To prevent this, you ſay, <q>they have in forming the new Counties ſo ordered it, that but ten Repreſentatives are ſent from five frontier Counties, and twenty ſix from the three interior Counties under the Quakers Influence.</q>
It is no uncommon Thing to find Men who have invented a Falſehood to promote their wicked Deſigns, to loſe themſelves when they attempt to offer Reaſons in Support of it. This certainly is your Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance; for can there be any Reaſon or Cauſe for <hi>envying</hi> a Power which the Frontiers do not enjoy, and which you declare the Quakers have ſo ordered, that they cannot exerciſe it.—This weak Reaſon for the Quakers Uncharitableneſs I ſhall leave at preſent for you to mend, or to invent a new One, as ſhall be moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to you.— But why would you venture thus, without the leaſt Foundation, to impute to the Quakers a Paſſion which it is here ſo well known, may, with the ſtricteſt Juſtice and Propriety, be charged to yourſelves. <hi>Envy,</hi> and a <hi>Thirſt after Power,</hi> are your characteriſtic Paſſions.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009892_0022_0F7AD588C2EE5DC0"/>
Envy at the Encreaſe, Happineſs and Promotion of the Church of England and the Quaker Religion, is what deſtroys your Peace, and renders you thus reſtleſs and tumultuous: And Thirſt after Power, never to be ſatiated until all other Societies are reduced to your Domain, is the chief Motive of your late Conduct. It requires no great Depth of Penetration to perceive this Truth.— Should the Frontiers ſucceed in their unreaſonable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which has ſprung entirely from your Policy, the Legiſlative Power would be in the Hands of your Sect, and your whole Scheme of Dominion executed at once. Hence ariſes your Complaint that the Frontiers are not juſtly repreſented. And do you then ſeriouſly think, that a People who have thus groſsly abuſed the Share of Power they at preſent enjoy, who have trampled on all Laws both human and divine, to gratify their frantic Rage and ſuperſtitious Fury, and who have ſpurned at, defied and inſulted the Powers of Government itſelf, ſhould be entruſted with more? This Queſtion, if I am right in judging from your paſt Conduct, you will certainly anſwer in the Affirmative: For you ſeem deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſucceed in your Plan at all Adventures. Hence it is that you deſerted the ſacred Duties of your Profeſſion for the Sake of Politicks. Hence it is that you have long ſince laid your Schemes to render your own Sect the moſt numerous and powerful in <hi>America.</hi> Hence it is that all thoſe Riots and Tumults which have put an End to all Government in the Province, encouraged and countenanced by your Performances, have ariſen. And from theſe Motives have proceeded all your falſe Clamours, groundleſs Abuſe and infamous Calumnies againſt the Quakers, whoſe Merit has recommended them to that Confidence of the People of other Societies, which your own never could obtain; and whoſe Conduct in Support of the Government and its Laws againſt the moſt wicked Attempts, has been a Mountain of Oppoſition in your Progreſs to lawleſs Power, the great Object of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009892_0023_0F7AD58975361200"/>
your Wiſhes. Be not deceived, Rev. Sirs, your Plan is not ſo deeply laid as to conceal theſe ſolemn Truths from Perſons of other Profeſſions: They ſee your Deſigns, and it is much to be regretted, that the Eyes of thoſe unhappy Men, who have long been made the Dupes of your Folly and Wickedneſs, were not alſo opened, that they might ſee the Ruin which your Doctrines and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct muſt lead to, ſooner or later.</p>
            <p>BUT to proceed in manifeſting the Weakneſs of the Foundation upon which you attempt to erect your Power:
<q>The Charter, <hi>you ſay,</hi> allows to every County four Members at leaſt to repreſent them,</q>
and that the Frontiers "deſire this Privilege." Here you diſcover the Folly of Divines when they undertake to expound Temporal Laws. In the Year 1701, the <hi>Province</hi> and <hi>Territories</hi> were united in Legiſlation; they conſiſted of ſix Counties, three in each: The Proprietor and People finding the Original Frame of Government defective, agreed on a new Charter; the whole Number of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives was ſettled at Twenty-four, i. e. four for each County. And therefore the Charter, in erecting and proportioning the Legiſlative Authority of the Counties then laid out; declares, in §. 2.
<q>That there ſhall be an Aſſembly yearly choſen by the Freemen thereof, to conſiſt of four Perſons out of each County;</q>
making in the Whole the Number intended.—But as there was then a Probability, from ſome Differences ſubſiſting between the Members of the three Counties of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and thoſe of the three Counties of the Territories, that they would ſeparate in Legiſlation, in the ſubſequent Part of the Charter a Power is given to them for that Purpoſe: And, in caſe they ſhould ſeparate, it was further declared, that the Inhabitants of each of the three Counties of this Province ſhould not have leſs than 8 Members to repreſent them in Aſſembly, without the leaſt Direction for the future Regulation of the Conduct of the Government, in forming <hi>new Counties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:009892_0024_0F7AD58A2A0337F0"/>IMMEDIATELY after the Execution of this Charter, the Province and Territories ſeparated; and each of the three <hi>Provincial</hi> Counties elected and ſent to the Seat of Legiſlation 8 Members, making up the Number 24, as the Charter directed. And the three <hi>Lower Counties</hi> ſent 18, <hi>i. e.</hi> Six for each County, to their Aſſembly; I ſuppoſe by Virtue of a Law made for that Purpoſe. Hence the Meaning and Deſign of the Charter appears to be no more than to aſcertain the Number of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers for each of the Counties <hi>then in being;</hi> and to limit that of the Provincial Aſſembly to 24, leaving the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Legiſlatures to grant ſuch a Number of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives to the new Counties, if any ſhould thereafter be erected, as upon Conſideration of their Circumſtances ſhould appear prudent and ſafe. Any other Conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Charter muſt be abſurd and unjuſt.</p>
            <p>IT is ſcarcely poſſible to aſcertain the Number of Repreſentatives that ought to be in any Country, and much leſs in a new One, on equitable Principles. I know of no Rule to fix their Proportions, but the Number of Taxables, and the Quantity of Money they pay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Defence and Support of the Government. And as the Number and Quantity of theſe are ſubject to continual Encreaſe and Changes, even this Mode muſt be attended with Difficulties if carried ſtrictly into Practice.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, let us for once agree on this as a Rule, as we know of no better at preſent, and thereby examine into the Juſtice of the Complaint of the Frontier Counties, that they are not <hi>equally repreſented.</hi> To determine the Matter, we muſt fix on one County as a <hi>Standard:</hi> None can be ſettled as ſuch with more Propriety than the County of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> becauſe it is the moſt opulent and numerous, and contains a greater Number of Men, who underſtand Government and Laws. Now the County of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> contains about 8300 Taxables, and pays towards the Support and Defence of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment annually, upwards of £. 12,400, and ſends eight
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009892_0025_0F7AD58ACA178EA0"/>
Members to repreſent it in Aſſembly. Calculate the Number of Members which the five Frontier Counties ought to ſend, by the ſame Rule of Proportion; and <hi>Lancaſter, York,</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi> will be found to be entitled to ſend no more than what they now have a Right to ſend by the Laws in force; <hi>Cumberland</hi> one more than it ought, and <hi>Berks</hi> one leſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>

                  <p>In Proportion to the publick Taxes paid by any Part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, we muſt naturally conclude there is an Intereſt to defend; ſo that whatever Number of Members <hi>Cumberland</hi> County may require to defend a Property that pays £. 1200, it muſt naturally follow, that <hi>Philadelphia</hi> County which pays above ten Times that Sum, ſhould at leaſt have ten Times the Number of Repreſentatives, and the other Counties in the ſame Proportion.</p>
               </note> Thus you find, upon a candid and fair Examination that the Complaint which you have wickedly infuſed into the Heads of the Frontier Inhabitants againſt the Quakers, is without the leaſt Juſtice or Foundation The Frontier Counties are upon the whole, as fully repreſented as the firſt and principal County in the Province.—Indeed they are not equally repreſented among themſelves, as one of them enjoys the Right of ſending one Member <hi>more</hi> than it ought, and another ſends one <hi>leſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT ſuppoſing the Frontier Counties had not been equally repreſented—Why is this Charge made againſt the Quakers? Was not the Number of the Repreſentatives eſtabliſhed by an Act of the whole Legiſlature, in which the <hi>Governor,</hi> whom you will allow was not a <hi>Quaker,</hi> had an equal Share? And permit me alſo to remind you that the Inhabitants, at the Time they petitioned for theſe
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009892_0026_0F7AD58C1B2AC1F8"/>
Counties to be formed out of the old Ones, never requeſted in any of their Petitions to have a ſeparate Election.— All the Inconveniencies therein complained of, were the Diſtance from the Courts of Juſtice, and the Difficulty of attending them to bring Malefactors to Juſtice, or to recover their civil Rights, when invaded. And the Government might have remedied the Miſchiefs pointed out to them, and left the People of theſe Counties to attend the Election of Repreſentatives in the old Counties, without any reaſonable Complaint, as has been done in two neighbouring Provinces.</p>
            <p>BUT what fully evinces the Abſurdity of ſome of the back Counties complaining that their Intereſt ſuffers by the interior Counties having a greater Number of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives than they, and ſhows that they have been put upon this Meaſure to anſwer Party Purpoſes, is, that they have generally elected a Part of their Repreſentatives from among the Inhabitants of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> owing to their having hardly any Perſons of ſufficient Lieſure and Property in their own Counties, who would be at the Trouble and Expence of ſerving them in that Capacity. So that if they were to have an additional Number allow'd them, they would be obliged to elect them from the City likewiſe, which would make the Ballance, if at preſent againſt them, ſtill greater in their Disfavour. Even thoſe Members who are choſen among themſelves, can ſcarce ever be got to attend more than half a Seſſions, alledging, that they cannot afford to be abſent ſo long a Time from their Families and Buſineſs; and I am convinced, that if thoſe Counties were obliged to ſend 8, or even 4 Members each, to the Aſſembly, from among their own Inhabitants, and their Wages to be paid by the County, we ſhould have much louder Complaints on that Head, than any we have yet had for Want of Repreſentatives.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add to the Evidences already given of the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Diſpoſition of the Quakers towards the Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians on the Frontiers, what you mention in your Letter
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009892_0027_0F7AD58CB5AF1E48"/>
of their having beſtow'd £. 5000, <hi>in Preſents to the Indians,</hi> notwithſtanding you have ſo ſeverely cenſured them on that Account. What the exact Sums were, which theſe People have expended in <hi>Preſents</hi> to the <hi>Indians,</hi> I cannot aſcertain; tho' I doubt not but they were conſiderable, as their Contributions to publick Services generally have been: They may perhaps have amounted to the Sum you mention. I am however fully perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the greateſt Benevolence and publick Spirit, were manifeſted by their Conduct on this Occaſion; and the Facts will I think prove it.</p>
            <p>A FEW of the Quakers, when they conſidered the Friendſhip which had ſubſiſted between the firſt Settlers of the Province and the Indians; the repeated Acts of Love and Benevolence, which the former had on all Occaſions ſhewn to the latter; the Cordiality and brotherly Union which had continued without ever being broken, from the Dawn of the Colony to the Time of the late Indian Hoſtilities; were prevailed on to think that ſome extraordinary Cauſe muſt have given Riſe to ſuch a Change of Conduct in the Indians, from whom they and their Predeceſſors had received ſuch Proofs of <hi>Humanity</hi> and <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> They alſo reflected, that little Security was to be expected in the military Way, as the Diſputes between the two Branches of the Legiſlature, obſtructed the Aids that were neceſſary for that Purpoſe:<note n="*" place="bottom">

Frontiers were then bleeding in every Quarter, the People in the utmoſt Conſternation, and the Country every Day more and more deſerted for want of Protection. Theſe Things, I ſay, led them to think, that if the Indians could be brought to a Conference with the Government, an Explanation of their Aggrievances, if any, might be obtained, and thoſe Aggrievances redreſſed; that Peace might be reſtored to the deſponding Inhabitants of the Frontiers, and the <hi>antient Friends</hi> of the Province be taken from their new Allies the <hi>French,</hi> and reſtored to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt; which, at that Time, in <hi>America,</hi> had the moſt unfavourable Appearance.

            <p>IN purſuance of this Policy, <hi>firſt</hi> thought of, and recommended to the Government by the <hi>Quakers.</hi> Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were ſent to the Indians, and the Treaty at <hi>Eaſton</hi> held with them. And it is a Truth too notorious to be denied, that from the Arrival of the Meſſengers from the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009892_0029_0F7AD58DC8DEFB18"/>
Governor at <hi>Tiagon,</hi> a Northern Settlement of Indians, the ſalutary Effects of this Meaſure were obvious. Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities immediately ceaſed on our Northern Frontiers, a Stop was put to the moſt cruel Devaſtations, and Peace for a Time reſtored to thoſe unhappy People, which the Province at that Time was unable to procure from any other Meaſure whatever.</p>
            <p>AFTER this the <hi>firſt Treaty</hi> at <hi>Eaſton</hi> was held; the Truſtees of the <hi>Friendly Aſſociation</hi> attended it, and offered their Purſe and their Services to the Government; the Governor chearfully accepted their Preſents, and gave them to the Indians in their Names, together with another from the Government.</p>
            <p>AND, at the <hi>ſecond Treaty</hi> at <hi>Eaſton,</hi> the Truſtees again waited on the Governor with a written Addreſs, and offered their Service; he was pleas'd to approve of their Conduct, agreed to accept their Preſents, and invited them to attend the Treaty; which they accordingly did, to the Satisfaction of the Governor, with whoſe Approbation their Preſents were at this Time alſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Indians.</p>
            <p>THE good Effects of theſe, with ſeveral ſubſequent Treaties, were ſoon felt; the Frontier Inhabitants were made eaſy, many Lives were ſaved, the Complaints of the Indians againſt the Proprietors were ſettled, and a fortunate Iſſue put to their ſavage Depredations; which could not otherwiſe have been effected, without an immenſe Expence of both Blood and Treaſure. Thus benevolent and charitable, and founded on the wiſeſt Policy, were the Preſents given by theſe People, with the <hi>Approbation</hi> of the Governor, to the Indians, which you, Reverend Sirs, have baſely repreſented as proceeding from a greater Reſpect and Regard for the Enemy, than for the People of the Province.</p>
            <p>THAT the Indians have had frequent juſt Cauſes of Complaint againſt the Proprietaries and their Agents, may be ſeen in a Pamphlet written in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and

Nay, ſo many and frequent are the Inſtances of Injuſtice being done to the Indians by Britiſh Subjects, that Accounts of them have at length reach'd the Throne, and occaſioned ſeveral wiſe and humane Orders to be iſſued, for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the ſame in future. In ſeveral of the American Gazettes was publiſhed a circular <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> dated <hi>December</hi> 9, 1761, to the Governors of the different Colonies, of which the following is an Extract, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>WHEREAS the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> of our Colonies and Plantations upon the Continent of America, does <hi>greatly depend</hi> upon the <hi>Amity</hi> and <hi>Alliance</hi> of the ſeveral Nations and Tribes of <hi>Indians</hi> bordering upon the ſaid Colonies, and upon a juſt and faithful Obſervance of thoſe Treaties and Compacts, which have been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ſolemnly entered into with the ſaid Indians, by our Royal Predeceſſors, Kings and Queens of this Realm. And whereas, <hi>notwithſtanding</hi> the repeated Inſtructions which have been, from Time to Time, given by our late Royal Grandfather, to the Governors of our ſeveral Colonies upon this Head, the ſaid Indians have made, and do ſtill continue to make <hi>great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,</hi> that Settlements have been made, and Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion taken of Lands, the Property of which they have by Treaty reſerved to themſelves, by Perſons claiming the ſaid Lands, <hi>under pretence of Deeds of Sale and Conveyance illegally, fraudulently and ſurreptitiouſly obtained of the ſaid Indians:</hi> And whereas it has like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe been repreſented to us, that <hi>ſome</hi> of our <hi>Governors,</hi> or other chief Officers of our ſaid Colonies, <hi>regardleſs</hi> of the Duty they owe to us, and of the Welfare and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009892_0031_0F7AD590D403BFB0"/>
Security of our Colonies, have countenanced ſuch <hi>unjuſt</hi> Claims and Pretenſions, by paſſing Grants of the Lands ſo pretended to have been purchaſed of the Indians. We therefore taking this Matter into our Royal Conſideration, as alſo the <hi>fatal Effects</hi> which would attend a <hi>Diſcontent</hi> among the <hi>Indians</hi> in the <hi>preſent Situation</hi> of Affairs, and being determined upon all Occaſions, to <hi>ſupport</hi> and <hi>protect</hi> the ſaid <hi>Indians</hi> in their juſt Rights and Poſſeſſions, and to keep <hi>inviolable</hi> the Treaties and Compacts which have been entered into with them. Do hereby ſtrictly enjoin and command, that neither yourſelf, nor any Lieutenant Governor, Preſident of the Council, or Commander in Chief of our ſaid Province, do, upon any Pretence whatſoever, upon Pain of our higheſt Diſpleaſure, and of being forthwith removed from your or his Office, paſs any Grant or Grants to any Perſon whatſoever, of any Lands within or adjacent to the Territories poſſeſſed or occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by the ſaid Indians, or the Property or Poſſeſſion of which has at any Time been reſerved to, or claimed by them."—"And it is our further Will and Pleaſure, that you forthwith cauſe theſe our Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to you to be made publick, not only within all Parts of our ſaid Province, inhabited by our Subjects, but alſo amongſt the ſeveral Tribes of Indians living in the ſame; to the End that our Royal Will and Pleaſure in the Premiſes may be known, and that the <hi>Indians</hi> may be apprized of our <hi>determined Reſolution</hi> to <hi>ſupport</hi> them in their <hi>juſt Rights,</hi> and <hi>inviolably to obſerve our Engagements.</hi> G. R.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AND from His Majeſty's Proclamation, dated <hi>October</hi> 7, 1763, is the following Extract, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>And whereas great <hi>Frauds</hi> and <hi>Abuſes</hi> have been committed in the purchaſing Lands of the <hi>Indians,</hi> to the <hi>great Prejudice</hi> of <hi>our Intereſts,</hi> and to the <hi>great Diſſatisfaction</hi> of the <hi>Indians;</hi> in order therefore to prevent ſuch Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009892_0032_0F7AD5918EF05358"/>
for the future, and to the End that the <hi>Indians</hi> may be convinced of <hi>Our Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>determined Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to <hi>remove</hi> all reaſonable <hi>Cauſe of Diſcontent,</hi> We do,</q>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>You next proceed to relate the Feats of the Provincials and Volunteers, in deſtroying the Indian Towns, and their Corn; and to give an Account, ſuch as it is, of that <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>heroic</hi> Action of deſtroying the Indians at <hi>Coneſtogo</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> Let us have it in your own Words, for I think there is ſomething curious in them;
<q>They (the Volunteers) ſay you, returned enraged to find that an Indian Town of about 20 or 30 Perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had now informed their Friends againſt whom our Men had marched, and who were perfidiouſly playing the ſame Pranks as they did laſt War; they marched to their Town and cut off ſome of them, others fled to a Borough called <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and there they came and cut them off. This the Quakers have painted as a Maſſacre and moſt horrid Murder, tho' it was no more but what our People ſuffered on all Occaſions.</q>
In this Repreſentation of the Murders at <hi>Coneſtogo</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> you have aſſerted ſeveral of the groſſeſt Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, miſrepreſented ſeveral Circumſtances, and omitted the moſt eſſential and material Facts:—For, give me Leave to aſk you, what Foundation have you for aſſerting, that theſe miſerable <hi>Victims</hi> to the Rage of <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> ever gave the leaſt Information to the Enemy of the Volunteers deſign; You, or thoſe whoſe <hi>barbarous Murders</hi> you palliate and juſtify, have taken great Pains to procure ſome Proof of it, but in vain. Had you ſucceeded, you would no doubt have laid them before the Government, to ſhow that they were Enemies, or at leaſt that they adhered to the Enemies. But Nothing of this kind has been done; and therefore the whole Province muſt be convinced, that all your Accuſations againſt them are founded in Policy, not in Truth. They were indeed invented after the Fact done, to palliate a Deed
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009892_0033_0F7AD59273CF7168"/>
which muſt excite in every humane <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> utmoſt Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence. For it is unfortunate for <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> that the very Perpetrators of the horrid Act at the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it was done, gave a very different Reaſon, viz.
<q>That they were <hi>Heathens,</hi> and therefore ſhould be cut off from the Face of the Earth.</q>
—But let us enquire in what Light the <hi>Governor, Council,</hi> and <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> of the Province, looked on theſe barbarous Actions. Let us inſpect the Meſſages which paſſed between them, and your Miſrepreſentations and Falſehoods will appear glaring and wicked indeed.—In a Meſſage from the Governor to the Aſſembly, dated Dec. 21, 1763, he expreſſes himſelf in this Manner.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am alſo to lay before you a Piece of Intelligence I received from <hi>Lancaſter</hi> on <hi>Friday</hi> laſt, which has given me the utmoſt Concern.—On the Fourteenth Inſtant, a Number of People, well armed and mounted, went to the <hi>Indian</hi> Town in <hi>Coneſtogo</hi> Manor, and, <hi>without the leaſt Reaſon or Provocation, in cool Blood, barbarouſly killed</hi> ſix of the <hi>Indians</hi> ſettled there, and would probably have treated all the reſt with the <hi>ſame Cruelty,</hi> had they not providentially been abroad at that Time; and after burning all their Houſes, the Perpetrators of this <hi>inhumane</hi> and <hi>wicked</hi> Action re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>As the <hi>Indians</hi> were <hi>ſeated</hi> on the Manor by the <hi>Government,</hi> and had lived there <hi>peaceably and inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively</hi> during <hi>all</hi> our late Troubles, I conceived they were as much under the <hi>Protection</hi> of the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and its <hi>Laws,</hi> as <hi>any others</hi> amongſt us; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thought it my Duty to do every Thing in my Power for the immediate apprehending and bringing to Juſtice the Authors of this <hi>horrid Scene;</hi> and accordingly, by the <hi>Advice</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> I have diſpatched Letters to the Magiſtrates of <hi>Lancaſter, Cumberland</hi> and <hi>York</hi> Counties, requiring and charging them to exert themſelves, and endeavour, by all
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009892_0034_0F7AD5930D406908"/>
poſſible Means, to diſcover and ſecure the Principals concerned in this <hi>outrageous Act,</hi> and their Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices. I am alſo preparing a Proclamation, ordering and requiring all Officers, civil and military, and all His Majeſty's Subjects in this Government, to be aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and aſſiſting to the Magiſtrates in the Execution of the Laws on this unhappy Occaſion.—Such of the <hi>Coneſtogoe Indians</hi> as had the good Fortune to eſcape the <hi>Fury</hi> of the abovementioned <hi>lawleſs Party,</hi> are now taken under the <hi>Protection</hi> of the <hi>Magiſtracy at Lancaſter,</hi> and are ſecured in the Workhouſe there, but are in great Diſtreſs for Want of Neceſſaries and Apparel, having loſt every Thing, except the little they had on their Backs, in their Houſes, which were burnt.—As they do not apprehend themſelves to be ſafe where they are, they have, by a verbal Meſſage by one of your Members, requeſted of me that they may be removed to this City, or its Neighbourhood; and I am <hi>very ready</hi> to <hi>comply</hi> immediately with <hi>their Deſire,</hi> provided you will enable me to defray the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AND in another Meſſage, dated <hi>January</hi> 3, 1764, his Honour has theſe Words, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I WAS preparing a Meſſage, to inform you of the <hi>cruel</hi> MASSACRE of the <hi>Indians,</hi> in the Work-Houſe of the Borough of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> on the 27th of laſt Month, by a <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>lawleſs</hi> Sett of <hi>Rioters,</hi> when I received a Meſſage by two of your Members, that you were already made fully acquainted with the Particulars of that <hi>horrid Scene of Barbarity,</hi> and <hi>inſolent and daring violation of the Laws.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>WIDELY different indeed, Reverend Sirs, is this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the <hi>Facts</hi> from that you have baſely impoſed on the People in <hi>England.</hi> You here find the Governor and his Council, who are far more proper Judges of the Matter, than Perſons in your clerical Offices,—declare, that theſe unhappy <hi>Indians</hi> were
<q>ſeated on the Manor
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009892_0035_0F7AD593D0D4E620"/>
by the <hi>Government,</hi>—that they had lived there <hi>peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably</hi> and <hi>inoffenſively,</hi> during all our late Troubles,— that they were as much under its <hi>Protection</hi> and its <hi>Laws</hi> as <hi>any others</hi> amongſt us,—and that they were <hi>barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly killed,</hi> nay <hi>cruelly maſſacred,</hi> in <hi>cool Blood</hi> without the <hi>leaſt Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Provocation.</hi>
               </q>
Certainly then, let theſe Actions be "painted" by <hi>Quakers</hi> or <hi>others,</hi> they convey the full Idea of a <hi>"Maſſacre</hi> and a moſt <hi>horrid Murder."</hi> How then ſhall we account for the Offence you have taken at the Terms applied to them, and your Manner of gloſſing over this moſt infernal Villainy? Is it becauſe you are attached to every Villain, and would ſcreen him from the juſt Puniſhment of the Laws, who is of the ſame Denomination of Religion with yourſelves?—or becauſe you think it no Offence to take away the Life of a human Creature who is of a different Colour or Perſuaſion?</p>
            <p>INDEED, ſeveral of your Writers in favour of the <hi>Paxton Men,</hi> have before expreſſed much Reſentment, that the <hi>Killing</hi> of the <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould be called <hi>Murder.</hi> One of them in particular, ſpeaking of the worthy Author of the <hi>Narrative,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">An Abſtract of the <hi>Narrative</hi> of the Maſſacres in <hi>Lancaſter</hi> County, was publiſhed in the <hi>Gentleman's Magazine</hi> for April, 1764. And in the Magazine for <hi>June,</hi> was inſerted a Piece, entituled,
<q>An impartial Account of the Riſe and Proceedings of the <hi>Paxton</hi> Volunteers,</q>
by way of <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Narrative.</hi> This Piece, it is ſaid, was compiled, by Order of the Pr—rs, from the <hi>Plain Dealers,</hi> and other virulent Publications of the Pr—ry Party, in hopes of prejudicing His Majeſty and his Miniſters againſt the Quakers, as they had formerly done by the Publication of the <hi>Brief State</hi> and <hi>Brief View,</hi> which aimed at obtaining an Act of Parliament for rendering Quakers inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of holding Offices in this Government.—The numerous vile Falſehoods, however, of the Account publiſhed in the <hi>June</hi> Magazine, will readily appear upon the Peruſal of the authentic Documents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Addreſs.</note> has theſe Words, viz. <q>But it ſeems this Gentleman was determined to avail himſelf of any Thing, that he thought might bring Infamy and Odium upon the <hi>Paxton People;</hi> and for this End he has not <hi>ſcrupled</hi> to call the <hi>Killing</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi>

MURDER! —But I am perſuaded this Writer, with all his Ingenuity, will find it too hard a Taſk to prove it <hi>Murder.</hi>
               </q>
—Now, to convince this abſurd Author, and another equally abſurd who dates his Letter from <hi>Elizabeth-Town,</hi> that it is not ſo <hi>hard a Taſk,</hi> nor does require ſo much <hi>Ingenuity</hi> as they repreſent, to prove that the <hi>Killing</hi> of the <hi>Indians</hi> was properly and juſtly called <hi>Murder,</hi> I ſhall give them the following Extract from a new Work, entitled, <hi>Lex Coronatoria,</hi> viz.
<q>When a Man of the Age of Diſcretion, and <hi>compos mentis,</hi> unlawfully, publickly or privately, by any external Act of Violence, killeth any reaſonable Creature, <hi>in rerum Natura,</hi> under the King's <hi>Protection;</hi> Subject, or <hi>Alien,</hi> Chriſtian, or <hi>Heathen,</hi> attainted, or <hi>not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted,</hi> with Malice forethought, either expreſs or implied; and the Party die of the Wound, or the Hurt, within the Year and the Day, <hi>this</hi> KILLING is MURDER; and even in the Caſe of a Feme-Covert, if committed with the Huſband, Coercion is no Plea.—Vide 1 <hi>Hale,</hi> 429, 433, 434.—<hi>Bro. Cor.</hi> 196.—<hi>Fitz. Cor.</hi> 323.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the Author of <hi>The Conduct of the Paxton-Men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially repreſented</hi> (from whom the above Quotation reſpecting the Author of the <hi>Narrative</hi> is made) not ſatisfied with having thus expoſed his Folly and Ignorance, has had the horrid Impiety to undertake to <hi>juſtify,</hi> from <hi>Scripture,</hi> the <hi>Murdering</hi> of Perſons in <hi>cool Blood,</hi> even tho' a Man may have <hi>pledg'd his Faith</hi> to them, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he may at the very Time be <hi>receiving</hi> from them <hi>Acts of Hoſpitality</hi> and <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> Permit me to tell you, Reverend Sirs, that when you, or thoſe you are connected with, publiſh to the World ſuch <hi>horrid Doctrines</hi> as theſe, you do yourſelves and your Cauſe more real Diſſervice than would ever be in the Power of your warmeſt Adverſaries: For every rational humane Being muſt neceſſarily hold the Men who can publickly avow ſuch <hi>Tenets</hi> in the greateſt Deteſtation! And
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:009892_0037_0F7AD5956BAFBB28"/>
you may depend that thoſe of your Society who now blindly follow you in thus <hi>vindicating Murderers,</hi> and in <hi>oppoſing a Royal Government,</hi> will ultimately find themſelves involved in much Confuſion and Diſgrace.</p>
            <p>THE next Thing that calls for my Attention is another Charge equally falſe and groundleſs againſt the Quakers, —
<q>That a Party of Indians <hi>among the Inhabitants</hi> that carried the Enemies Arms and Ammunition, and had conducted them into the Settlements, and aſſiſted in murdering the Inhabitants, applied to the Quakers, and they found Means to bring them down to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and have maintained them at the Expence of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</q>
Here I conclude you mean the <hi>Moravian</hi> Indians of <hi>Nain</hi> and <hi>Weketank,</hi> two Plantations of the Brethren; for no Other Indians remained among the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants after the Maſſacre at <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> Theſe Indians you well know were Part of the <hi>Moravian Community,</hi> converted to the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> by Miſſionaries of their and <hi>your</hi> Society, lived on their Lands, and were daily under their Care. They were alſo received, as Subjects, and taken under the Protection of the Government at their particular Requeſt upwards of twenty Years ago, by Governor <hi>Thomas;</hi> afterwards, in the late War, by Governors <hi>Morris</hi> and <hi>Denny.</hi> They had ever ſince lived peaceably and inoffenſively in this Situation, if the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their Divines and others who were conſtantly reſident among them may be credited.—But as they were ſituated near the Frontiers, ſome of the People of the County were ſuſpicious that they held a ſecret Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Enemy: And one of them was charged with the Murder of one <hi>Stinſon</hi> in Company with other Indians, but was acquitted by a Jury of the County on a fair Trial. However, a Pannick ſeized many of the Inhabitants, and Numbers declared, if thoſe Indians remained among them, they would deſert their Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.—Several <hi>Requeſts</hi> came down to the <hi>Governor</hi> to deſire their Removal to ſome other Place.—He laid them
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:009892_0038_0F7AD59608EB91C0"/>
before the Provincial Commiſſioners, and at their Board it was agreed that the latter, ſome of them being Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Aſſembly, ſhould lay the Matter before the Houſe, with their Opinion thereon, that it was
<q>abſolutely neceſſary that theſe Indians ſhould be removed into the interior Parts of the Province,—where their Behaviour might be more cloſely obſerved.</q>
—Upon which the Houſe reſolved,
<q>that the Expence of their Removal and Support while it ſhould be neceſſary, be defrayed by the Government.</q>
And it is well known to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and the Board of Commiſſioners, that the Quakers never interfered in the Matter, nor indeed had they the leaſt Connection with theſe Indians. This, Reverend Sirs, is the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth, relative to the Tranſaction you impute to Quakers.—It was a meer Act of <hi>Government</hi> to prevent the Evacuation of the Settlements adjoining to <hi>Nain</hi> and <hi>Weketank,</hi> and indeed of the <hi>whole County</hi> of Northampton. How then could you charge this Fact to the Quakers without Bluſhing? You might with equal Juſtice and Reaſon impute the Murders at <hi>Coneſtogoe</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> or the late Death of the Emperor of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>BUT ſince you are ſo violent in cenſuring the Meaſures taken by the Government, permit me to aſk you, What Method would your Wiſdom, Prudence and Humanity have dictated to you, had you had the Power in <hi>your</hi> Hands? The bringing of them down to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> it ſeems you cenſure as highly criminal, and therefore no doubt but this would be your laſt Reſolution: Would you have driven them into the Woods, and obliged them to ſeek Protection from the Enemy, and of Conſequence to unite with them in their Barbarities againſt us? You certainly would not have done this: Common Prudence, nay common Senſe forbid it.—A Meaſure of this Kind which would ſtrip them of the Neceſſaries they had laid up for the Winter Seaſon, muſt have juſtly enraged them and rendered them our moſt dangerous and inveterate Foes.

I ſay moſt dangerous, becauſe beſides adding to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our Enemies, the Men were intimately acquainted with the interior Parts of the Province, and would no doubt have acted as Spies and Conductors to Parties of foreign Indians, to the utter Deſtruction of the Country.—But one Thing elſe remained that could be done, and this I make no ſcruple of ſaying, I doubt not but your Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Chriſtian Love towards them would have pointed out to you: I mean, to deprive them of their Arms, coop them up in a Pen or perhaps ſome ſtrong Houſe, and put them all to death, Men, Women and ſucking Infants, in one general Maſſacre. This, to be ſure, Gentlemen, would have been excellent Policy, it would have rendered theſe ſuſpected People inoffenſive indeed, and removed from the Minds of the Frontier Inhabitants all Apprehenſions of Danger from them.—Am I too ſevere in this Cenſure? —Muſt we not ſuppoſe that the Men whoſe wicked Hearts without the leaſt Qualm or Remorſe can invent a Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood with the iniquitous Deſign of bringing into Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace a whole Society of People, can take Offence at others for calling the moſt horrid Scenes of Infernal Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and Cowardice by their proper Names <hi>Maſſacre</hi> and <hi>Murder,</hi> and can even <hi>vindicate</hi> the <hi>Perpetrators</hi> of the <hi>Savage Acts,</hi> would not heſitate to act on ſuch Principles?</p>
            <p>DISAGREABLE as it is to me, and unneceſſary as it muſt appear to every candid Mind, after refuting ſuch a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of malignant Charges againſt the Quakers, to wade through all the Untruths contained in your Letter, yet ſince I have undertaken it, I ſhall proceed. The very next Sentence to the one I have remarked on, contains another Falſehood. You aſſert, that
<q>
                  <hi>afterwards</hi> ſome of the very Indians that were beat at the Munſey-Hill, and that had their Corn deſtroyed, ſued for the ſame Privilege, and <hi>were brought</hi> to Philadelphia, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Province.</q>
—Here I again conclude your dark Expreſſions mean the <hi>Wighalouſin</hi> Indians,—for none others ſued for the Protection of the Government, or were
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:009892_0040_0F7AD5988ABCA840"/>
brought down after the Moravian Tribes.—Theſe Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were lately in the Barracks, and if any of them were in the Engagement of Munſey-Hill, why have you not informed the Government and proved the Fact? —I call on you to do it yet. And if you do not, will not all Men unite in determining that your Delight is Falſehood and Defamation, and that you are, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding your religious Profeſſions, loſt to all Senſe of Morality and Religion?</p>
            <p>BUT ſuppoſe ſome of thoſe Indians were brought down with the <hi>Wighalouſin</hi> Tribe. The Cenſure cannot remain with the <hi>Quakers,</hi>—for this Tranſaction which you have wickedly imputed to them was alſo the <hi>Act of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Theſe poor Indians, moſt of whom are converted to the Chriſtian Faith, being our Friends, and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of Danger, not only from the violent Rage of the Frontier Inhabitants, but from the Enemy Indians; ſent Meſſengers down to treat with the <hi>Governor</hi> reſpecting their State of Inſecurity. And in their Conferences with <hi>him,</hi> intreated the Protection of the <hi>Government,</hi> and requeſted that they might come down and live among us. —The <hi>Governor</hi> convinced of their Sincerity, warmly <hi>recommended,</hi> the Matter to the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> who agreed to the Meaſure, and to provide for them during their Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence among us.

            <p>
               <q>I lay before you the Minutes of ſeveral Conferences I have held with <hi>Papounan,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Indians,</hi> who live at <hi>Wighalouſin,</hi> on the River <hi>Saſquehanna.</hi> I have <hi>no Reaſon to doubt</hi> that they have diſcloſed to me <hi>all that they really know</hi> of the preſent State of the <hi>Indian</hi> War, and of the <hi>Cauſes aſſigned</hi> by the Enemy <hi>Indians</hi> in their Neighbourhood for their renewing Hoſtilities againſt us.—They have intimated to me that they, and a few others, with whom they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, being really our <hi>ſincere Friends,</hi> are uneaſy at their preſent Situation, and would incline to come and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009892_0041_0F7AD599433AC458"/>
live among us, if we would <hi>receive</hi> and <hi>protect</hi> them. They have been very importunate with me for an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Anſwer, alledging, as they have been very kindly treated by us, if this Overture ſhould be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe favourably accepted, that it would <hi>confirm</hi> thoſe who are already well diſpoſed, and alſo <hi>incline many others,</hi> who are at preſent <hi>in Arms</hi> againſt us, to ſue for <hi>Peace.</hi>

               <q>THE <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> who are joined with me in the Diſpoſition of the public Money, were made acquainted with this Affair; and though they agreed with me as to the <hi>Expediency and Utility</hi> of the Meaſure, yet as it would be attended with Expence, and the public Funds were nigh exhauſted, we did not think proper to go into it.—I therefore recommend it to you to conſider this Matter; and if you <hi>concur with me in Opinion</hi> that this will be for the public Service, and will provide a Fund on the Occaſion, I deſire you will give me your Anſwer as ſoon as poſſible, that I may no longer detain the <hi>Indians,</hi> who are impatient to return Home with my Meſſages.</q>

            <p>THUS you find, and indeed you well knew it before, that this Meaſure which your Malice has imputed to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> took its Riſe with the <hi>Governor,</hi> and was <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> of by <hi>both</hi> Branches of the Legiſlature. A Meaſure conſiſtent with ſound Policy, as it prevented an Increaſe of the Number of our Enemies, and added to thoſe of our Friends. And as much ſo with Humanity, as it afforded Protection to thoſe that demanded it, and relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them from the Neceſſity of uniting with the Enemy, and the Perpetration of Cruelties that their Conſciences diſapproved of.</p>
            <p>TO unfold to the World all your Falſehoods is a tedious Taſk, not from the Difficulty of refuting them, but from the Number you have the Art of throwing into a ſmall Compaſs. You next aſſert, that theſe Indians,
<q>
                  <hi>at the Requeſt of a Quaker</hi> Faction, were guarded by a Company of the King's Troops.</q>
You, or ſome of you, Gentlemen, were on the Spot, and you muſt know the Facts to be as I ſhall now relate them.—The <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> receiving daily Accounts of the avow'd Deſign of the Rioters, to deſtroy the Indians in the Barracks, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them to the Province Iſland, a Place of difficult Acceſs, and more diſtant from the Danger of being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized: Flats were prepared to carry them off to ſome Place of Safety, in Caſe the Rioters ſhould put their rebellious Threats in Execution.—But the cold Weather
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:009892_0043_0F7AD59A8A033798"/>
coming on, and the River being full of Ice, both the Government, which was then deſtitute of any Mode of defending them, and the Indians themſelves, became uneaſy at their Situation. This drew a Requeſt from them to be removed to Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi>'s, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on the <hi>Governor</hi> to gratify them. They were accordingly ſent under the Care of Capt. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> of the Regulars, from hence to <hi>Amboy,</hi> in <hi>New-Jerſey;</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor <hi>Franklin</hi> having, at the Requeſt of Governor <hi>Penn,</hi> readily aſſented to their Paſſage through that Province. But from ſome Reaſons of Policy, the Governor and Council of <hi>New-York</hi> refuſed them Admittance into that Government. General <hi>Gage</hi> finding, that the Governor of <hi>Penſylvania</hi> had
<q>thought it adviſeable to put them under the Military," reſolved, "that they ſhould not be abandon'd by the Eſcort,</q>

                  <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> who were lately ſeated by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the <hi>Province Iſland,</hi> were, at their own earneſt Requeſt, ſent off in a Body by me, under an Eſcort, on the fifth Inſtant, with an Intention of removing them, through the Governments of <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> and <hi>New-York,</hi> to Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> to whoſe Care and Protection, as they were not in a State of Security here, I recommended them.</p>
                  <p>I took the Precaution of acquainting the reſpective Governors of thoſe two Provinces with this Meaſure, and requeſted that they would be pleaſed to permit them to proceed unmoleſted, and furniſh them with Paſſports. The Governor of <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> with great <hi>Politeneſs</hi> and <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> complied with my Requeſt; but, to my great Surprize, I received a Letter Yeſterday from the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-Governor of <hi>New-York,</hi> acquainting me that
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:009892_0044_0F7AD59B63037488"/>

            <p>THE Statute for ſuppreſſing of Riots, was, agreeable to this Requiſition, extended to this Province; and the Governor and his Council, in the <hi>greateſt Diſtreſs,</hi> invited the People to ſupport him, againſt the lawleſs Violence threatned by theſe Rebels, whoſe Cauſe your Pen is proſtituted to vindicate. The Governor himſelf appeared at the Head of the Citizens, and with the Advice of his Council, and the Provincial Commiſſioners, conducted the Whole. Which of theſe Facts will you have the Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to deny? Surely not that which the General ſo plainly declares in his Letter, That the Reaſon of his not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Indians "to be abandon'd by the Eſcort," was becauſe the <hi>Governor</hi>
               <q>had thought it adviſeable to put them under the Military."—But ſuppoſe, for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſake, this had been done "at the Requeſt of the Quakers,</q>
was it not both prudent and humane?—You will anſwer me, I doubt not in the Negative; becauſe it was, and it ſeems ſtill is your Opinion, that the Indians ſhould be maſſacred; or you could not take Offence at the only Meaſure which ſaved them from it. But will you conſider a Moment, that General <hi>Gage</hi>'s Conduct was approved of by both <hi>Governor</hi> and <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> and they acknowledged themſelves under <hi>Obligations</hi> to him for it? —The Governor informs the Aſſembly, that they will perceive by the General's Letter,
<q>how much we are obliged to him for the kind Part he has taken in this Matter:</q>
—And the Aſſembly requeſts the Governor
<q>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:009892_0048_0F7AD59F85C62640"/>will be pleaſed to return his Excellency their Thanks, for this generous and ſeaſonable Act of Goodneſs.</q>
And how indecent and fooliſh is it then in a few Clergymen, to undertake to cenſure the Conduct of a whole Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of his Majeſty's General, only becauſe it did not quadrate with their wicked and rebellious Sentiments, deſtructive of all Humanity, Allegiance and Order?</p>
            <p>BUT as you have repeatedly endeavoured to have it thought, that none but <hi>Quakers</hi> or their Friends, have painted the Actions of the <hi>Paxton</hi> Rioters in a horrid Light, I ſhall therefore give you an Extract of another Meſſage from the <hi>Governor,</hi> in which he expreſſes his Sentiments very ſtrongly with Regard to thoſe People.
<q>I am ſorry to inform you, ſays he, that the <hi>ſame Spirit</hi> and <hi>frantic Rage,</hi> which actuated thoſe who lately put to Death the <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>Lancaſter</hi> County, ſtill prevails among them; and that inſtead of having any <hi>Remorſe</hi> for, or in the leaſt dreading the bad Conſequences of their Conduct, I have juſt Reaſon to believe they are daily ſtrengthning their Party, and adding greatly to their Numbers, and threaten to come down armed in a Body, and repeat the ſame <hi>Acts of Cruelty</hi> on the <hi>Indians</hi> in the Barracks, in the <hi>Northern Liberties</hi> of this City, determined to <hi>ſpare none</hi> who oppoſe their <hi>wicked</hi> Deſigns. They have already given <hi>abundant Proof,</hi> that neither <hi>Religion, Humanity</hi> or <hi>Laws,</hi> are Objects of <hi>their</hi> Conſideration, or of <hi>ſufficient Weight</hi> to <hi>reſtrain</hi> them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I THINK, Reverend Sirs, you will hardly ſay that theſe Sentiments were dictated by a <hi>Quaker</hi> Faction; for among all the Faults you may find with this Gentleman's Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, you cannot ſurely charge him with any Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality to <hi>Quakers,</hi> whatever you may do to <hi>others.</hi> 'Tis however more than probable, that his H—r's <hi>Language</hi> is ſince <hi>altered</hi> with reſpect to thoſe Murderers, but it is impoſſible that his <hi>Sentiments</hi> ſhould. Whence this <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> aroſe is in your Power to unfold, and you may

poſſibly flatter yourſelves, that no one elſe is enabled to do it: I have, notwithſtanding great Reaſon to expect that it will not be long before you are fully convinced to the contrary.</p>
            <p>DETERMINED to depreſs and abuſe the Quakers, and to excuſe the Rioters, you are pleaſed to add what you ſay, were the Declarations of the latter,—
<q>Theſe Inſurgents (ſay you) declared that they were <hi>Loyal Subjects,</hi> and would not do what <hi>looked like Rebellion,</hi> tho' they thought it exceeding hard that they ſhould be obliged to pay Taxes to maintain their Enemies.</q>
With what View did you mention this Declaration?—Was it from any fooliſh Hope you had, that you could perſuade Mankind to credit the Aſſertions of Men, whoſe Actions had been, and were at the very Time flatly contradictory.—Your moral Philoſophy muſt tell you, that Actions are more evidently indicative of the Mind than Words.—Some of thoſe Rioters were the Men that had committed the Murders at <hi>Coneſtogoe</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter.,</hi> contrary to the Faith of the Government, the Laws of the Country, and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's Proclamation. Puſhed on by the Conſciouſneſs of Guilt, and a Dread of Puniſhment, mixed with an enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic Rage and Hatred againſt all Indians, they reſolved to take up Arms againſt the Government itſelf, prevailed with others to join them, with a View to encreaſe the Number of Offenders, ſo much as to render it dangerous or difficult to bring them to juſtice.—With this View they came down to <hi>Germantown,</hi> and from thence ſent out their Spies to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> to obſerve the Conduct and Preparations of the Government againſt them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually publiſhing their Reſolution to deſtroy the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>all that defended them;</hi> nor was the <hi>Governor</hi> himſelf free from their <hi>Menaces.</hi> And do you ſeriouſly think, Reverend Sirs, that the breaking of Goals and murdering of Indians under the immediate Protection of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in Defiance of its Proclamations and its Laws, does not <hi>"look like Rebellion,"</hi> and that the Conduct of
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:009892_0050_0F7AD5A0D58A1190"/>
theſe Rioters in endeavouring to proſecute their Murders were Proofs of their Loyalty?—That they ought not to ſubmit to the Laws of the Land, but had a Right to trample on all Laws, both Humane and Divine? If you do not, how could you without the higheſt Remorſe, offer a Syllable in Vindication of ſuch Rebels againſt their King, their Country and their God?</p>
            <p>HAVING thus by plain and authentic Evidence refuted all your malignant Slanders againſt a People whoſe Conduct in Life has been ever attended with the higheſt <hi>Reſpect for Government,</hi> and the <hi>trueſt Loyalty</hi> to their KING, whoſe <hi>publick Spirit</hi> has equalled their Loyalty, and whoſe <hi>Benevolence and Charity</hi> to Mankind in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral has not fallen ſhort of any one Sect in the World; I ſhall conclude this Addreſs to you, with a few ſerious Remarks on your Conduct, in Hopes of prevailing on you to alter it in future, and to amend your Hearts.</p>
            <p>To traduce the private Character of an Individual, is an Offence which every moral Man would bluſh at being charged with. And to aſperſe the publick Reputation of a whole Society, to accuſe them of Crimes of the moſt atrocious Nature, puniſhable with Death itſelf, without the leaſt Foundation, and to publiſh the Accuſation throughout the World in a publick News-paper, is an Offence ſo much more aggravated, that every good Mind muſt be ſtruck with Abhorrence at the Thought of it. Surely on a Moment's Reflection you muſt acknowledge, that it is contrary to the Duty of a good Member of Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with the Principles of Morality, and highly inconſiſtent with the Precepts of the <hi>bleſſed Goſpel.</hi> It is an Offence that ill becomes any Man, but much more ſo thoſe that have entrered into the ſacred and awful Engagements of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and publickly profeſs to be his Apoſtles. Muſt it not then give your Friends and Hearers, who rely on you for Guidance in the Paths of Religion, great Contempt for your Doctrines, and afflict
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:009892_0051_0F7AD5A149A281C8"/>
them with the deepeſt <hi>Sorrow,</hi> to find that you are Men who have been guilty of the Crime I have deſcribed.</p>
            <p>Is it wonderful, then,
<q>that you have been able to do <hi>Nothing</hi> (as you obſerve) to ſpread the Goſpel either among the <hi>Indians</hi> or <hi>Europeans?</hi>
               </q>
Have you taken even a probable Method of promoting the Truths of the bleſſed Goſpel?— It is juſtly obſerved by a great and good Divine, that Perſons in your Offices have Occaſion for their whole Time, to employ it
<q>in Study, Labour, and the Performance of their Duty, and that all the Powers of Humane Nature are ſcarcely ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to diſcharge it fully.</q>
I make a ſolemn Appeal to your own Conſciences: Have your Actions of late, diſcovered any Senſe of this Truth; to you an important Truth? Have you not, inſtead of endeavouring to ſpread the Goſpel, and laying out your Talent in a profitable Merchandize, been entering into the Intrigues of the World, and the Hurry of Politics? Has not your Time been engroſſed in the Works of Ambition, in paying court to the Great, and in learning and executing their wicked Artifices? Has it not been employed in the Invention of Falſehoods, to calumniate a religious Society of People, who have been long the Objects of your Envy and Hatred? Has it not been employed in forming the moſt vile Untruths, to cover the moſt horrid Crimes, and to reſcue from Puniſhment, Rebels againſt the Government, and the Murderers of the Innocent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it's Protection? Has it not been employed in promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Party Feuds and irreconcileable Diſcord among the People? In writing, and encouraging the writing of falſe and infamous Libels, dectructive of the Reputation of your honeſt Neighbours, which to them is more valuable than Life? Have you not ſubmitted your Judgments and Conſciences to the Direction of the Proprietary Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians, and buſied yourſelves in rendering the immediate Government of your Sovereign odious and deteſtable to his honeſt and faithful Subjects? Have you not wrote
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:009892_0052_0F7AD5A218764C70"/>
your <hi>Circular Letters,</hi> and ſent your Emiſſaries throughout the Province, repreſenting a <hi>Royal</hi> Government, as oppreſſive and tyrannical? Have you not for this very Purpoſe, proſtituted your Churches and Houſes, erected alone for the Worſhip of God, to hold your dirty Cabals, and to lay your Plans for carrying into Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Schemes of your Political Matters? Theſe Things have eradicated from your Hearts, that <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Meekneſs and Simplicity, which eveir diſtinguiſhed the Conduct of our Divine Inſtructor, and which ever muſt be the chief Ornament of his true Miniſters. You have left the Paths of Virtue, and become Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of Vice; you have exchanged <hi>true Religion</hi> for <hi>deceitful Politicks;</hi> for as you have uſed them they may be juſtly defin'd, <hi>Ars non tam regendi quam fallendi hominem.</hi> You have exchanged Brotherly <hi>Love, Peace</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will</hi> towards your Neighbours, for <hi>Envy, Malice</hi> and <hi>Falſehood.</hi> In fine, was I to ſearch the Defects of human Nature through, it would be impoſſible to find any Thing more inconſiſtent with the Principles of Chriſtianity, than the whole of your late Conduct. Could you expect then that the divine Author of all Goodneſs, Virtue, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Charity and univerſal Benevolence, would bleſs the feeble and inſincere Endeavours of ſuch, Inſtruments? If theſe divine Truths, or the Spirit of the Author of all true Religion, ever touched your Hearts, be exhorted to turn from the Evil of your Ways, like the prodigal Son, and repent in Duſt and Aſhes, that you may find Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; for you cannot "ſerve <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Mammon</hi> too."</p>
