            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is a very remarkable ſaying of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to his diſciples: <hi>Bleſſed are your eyes, for they ſee; and your ears, for they hear.</hi> It teaches us, that the dulneſs and heavineſs of mens minds, with regard to ſpiritual matters, is ſo great, that it may juſtly be compared to the want of eyes and ears, and that God has ſo filled every thing, and every place, with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and arguments for a godly life, that they who are but ſo bleſſed, ſo happy, as to uſe their eyes and their ears, muſt needs be affected with them.</p>
            <p>Now, tho' this was in a more ſpecial manner the caſe of thoſe, whoſe ſenſes were witneſſes of the life, miracles and doctrines of our bleſſed Lord, yet is it as truly the caſe of all Chriſtians at this time: for the reaſons of religion, and the calls to piety, are ſo written and engraved upon every thing, and preſent themſelves ſo ſtrongly and ſo conſtantly to all our ſenſes, in every thing that we meet, that they can only be diſregarded by eyes that ſee not, and ears that hear not. What greater motive to a religious life, than the vanity and poorneſs of all worldly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? And yet who can help ſeeing and feeling this every day of his life! What greater call to look towards God, than the pains, the ſickneſs, the croſſes and vexations of this life! And yet whoſe eyes and ears are not daily witneſſes of them! What miracles could more ſtrongly appeal to our ſenſes, or what meſſage from heaven ſpeak louder to us, than the daily dying and departure of our fellow-creatures does. Let us but intend to ſee and hear, and then the whole world becomes a book of wiſdom and inſtruction to us. All the miſtakes and diſappointments that happen to ourſelves, all the miſeries and errors that we ſee in other people, become ſo many plain leſſons of advice to us, teaching us with as much aſſurance as an angel from heaven, that we can no ways raiſe ourſelves to any true happineſs, but by turning all our thoughts, our wiſhes and endeavours after the happineſs of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:011654_0003_0F87C9DA007CA628"/>life. <hi>Octavius</hi> is a learned, ingenious man, well verſed in moſt parts of learning, and no ſtranger to any kingdom in Europe. The other day, being juſt recovered from a lingering fever, he took upon him to ſpeak thus to his friends: <q>My glaſs, ſays he, is almoſt run out; and your eyes ſee, how many marks of age and death I bear about me: But I plainly feel myſelf ſinking away faſter than any ſtanders-by imagine. I fully believe, that one year more will conclude my reckoning.</q> The attention of his friends were much raiſed by ſuch a declaration, expecting to hear ſomething truly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent from ſo learned a man, who had but a year longer to live; when <hi>Octavius</hi> proceeded in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <q>For theſe reaſons, ſays he, my friends, I have left off all taverns; the wine of thoſe places is not good enough for me in this decay of nature. I muſt now be nice in what I drink; I can't pretend to do, as I have done, and therefore am reſolved to furniſh my own cellar with a little of the very beſt, though it coſt me ever ſo much. I muſt alſo tell you, my friends, that age forces a man to be wiſe in many other reſpects, and makes us change many of our opinions and practices. You know how much I have liked a large acquaintance; I now condemn it as an error. Three or four chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diverting companions is all that I now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; becauſe I find that in my preſent infirmities, if I am left alone, or to grave company, I am not ſo eaſy to myſelf.</q> A few days after <hi>Octavius</hi> had made this declaration to his friends, he relapſed into his former illneſs, was committed to a nurſe, who cloſed his eyes before his freſh parcel of wine came in. Young <hi>Eugenius,</hi> who was preſent at this diſcourſe, went home a new man, with full reſolutions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting himſelf wholly unto God. <q>I never, ſays <hi>Eugenius,</hi> was ſo deeply affected with the wiſdom and importance of religion, as when I ſaw, how poorly and meanly the learned <hi>Octavius</hi> was to leave the world, thro' the want of it. How often had I
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011654_0004_0F87C9DA20F0D898"/>envied his great learning, his ſkill in languages, his knowledge of antiquity, his addreſs and fine manner of expreſſing himſelf upon all ſubjects! But when I ſaw, how poorly it all ended, what was to be the laſt year of ſuch a life, and how fooliſhly the maſter of all theſe accompliſhments was then forced to talk, for want of being acquainted with the joys and expectations of piety; I was thoroughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that there was nothing to be envied or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, but a life of true piety; nor any thing ſo poor and comfortleſs, as a death without it.</q> Now as the young <hi>Eugenius</hi> was thus edified and inſtructed, ſo, if you are ſo happy as to have any thing of his thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful temper, you will find, that all the world preaches to an attentive mind; and that, if you have but ears to hear, almoſt every thing you meet, teaches you ſome leſſon of wiſdom. But now, if to theſe admonitions and inſtructions, which we receive from an experience of the ſtate of human life, if to theſe we add the lights of religion, thoſe great truths which the Son of God has taught us; it will be then as much paſt all doubt, that there is but one happineſs for man, as that there is but one God. Was all to die with our bodies, there might be ſome pretence for thoſe different ſorts of happineſs that are now ſo much talked of: But ſince our all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at the death of our bodies; ſince all men are to be immortal, either in miſery or happineſs, in a world entirely different from this; ſince they are all haſtening hence at all uncertainties, as faſt as death can cut them down, ſome in ſickneſs, ſome in health, ſome ſleeping, ſome waking, ſome at midnight, others at cock-crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all at hours that they know not of; is it not certain, that no man can exceed another in joy and happineſs, but ſo far as he exceeds in thoſe virtues, which fit him for a happy death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Serena</hi> is a lady poſſeſſed of a conſiderable eſtate, whoſe time and fortune is wholly employed in what is called a genteel, faſhionable way of life. Now, agreeable to the doctrine of the Goſpel, if <hi>Serena</hi> had been obliged by the neceſſities of life to waſh
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011654_0005_0F87C9DB4CEF7660"/>cloaths for a maintenance, to wait upon ſome miſtreſs, or to procure a poor living by teaching little children, it would then have been her duty to ſerve and glorify God by ſuch humility, obedience and faithfulneſs, as might adorn that ſtate of life in which it had pleaſed God to place her. It would have been her duty to improve that one talent in the beſt manner ſhe was able; that when the time came that mankind were to be rewarded for their labours, ſhe might be received with a <hi>Well done, good and faithful Servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</hi> But as God has given her five talents, as he has placed her above the neceſſities of life, in the happy liberty of chuſing the moſt exalted ways of virtue; as he has left her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do but to make the beſt uſe of variety of bleſſings, to make the moſt of a ſhort life, in ſtudying her own perfection, the honour of God, and the good of her neighbour, it is her buſineſs and duty to turn her five talents into five more, and to conſider how her time and health and fortune may be made ſo many happy means of purifying her own ſoul, improving her fellow creatures in the ways of virtue, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying her at laſt to the greateſt heigths of eternal glory. As ſhe has no miſtreſs to ſerve, her own ſoul ought to be the object of her daily care; ſhe is called to mourn for its impurities and imperfections, and ſtudy all ways and means of reſtoring it to its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive purity. This, <hi>Serena,</hi> is your indiſpenſible duty; for as ſure as God is one God, ſo ſure it is, that he has but one command to all mankind, whether they be bound or free, rich or poor; and that is, to act up to the excellency of that nature which he has given them, to live by reaſon, to walk in the light of religion, to glorify God in all his gifts, and dedicate every ſtate and condition of life to his ſervice.</p>
            <p>Let us look now at a ſtate of life, which draws the admiration and envy of far the greater part of the world, <hi>viz.</hi> the condition of thoſe who have amaſſed great riches; a ſituation which our bleſſed Saviour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to be extremely dangerous, <hi>Luke</hi> 18:24. <hi>How
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011654_0006_0F87C9DB9DF3C920"/>hardly ſhall they that have riches, enter into the kingdom of heaven!</hi> And again, <hi>Luke</hi> 6:24. <hi>Wo to you rich; for ye have received your conſolation.</hi> And yet a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which multitudes are preſſing after, many even without ſeeming to propoſe any other uſe from their riches, than the bare pleaſure of amaſſing and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing them. <hi>Negotius</hi> is a temperate honeſt man. He ſerved his time under a maſter of great trade, but has by his own management made it a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable buſineſs than ever it was before. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good of trade ſeems to <hi>Negotius</hi> to be the general good of life. As money is continually pouring in upon him, ſo he often lets it go in various kinds of expence and generoſity, and ſometimes in ways of charity. If you aſk what it is that has ſecured <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotius</hi> from all ſcandalous vices, it is the ſame thing that has kept him from all ſtrictneſs of devotion, it is his great buſineſs. He has always had too many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant things in his head, his thoughts have been too much employed, to ſuffer him to fall either into any courſe of rakery, or to feel the neceſſity of an inward ſolid piety. If <hi>Negotius</hi> was aſked, what it is he drives at in life, he would be at a loſs for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. He has ſeveral confuſed notions in his head, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is ſomething great to have more buſineſs than other people, to grow continually richer and richer, and to raiſe an immenſe fortune before he dies. The generality of people, when they think of happineſs, think upon <hi>Negotius,</hi> in whoſe life every inſtance of happineſs is ſuppoſed to meet. Let us now look at this condition in another, but truer light. Let it be ſuppoſed, that <hi>Negotius</hi> was a painful labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious man, every day deep in variety of affairs; that he was ſober and regular in his buſineſs; that he grew old in this courſe of trading, and that the end and deſign of all this labour was only this, that he may die poſſeſſed of more than an hundred thouſand pair of boots and ſpurs. Let it be ſuppoſed, that the ſober part of the world ſay of him, when he is dead, that he was a great and happy man, a thorough
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011654_0007_0F87C9E09AEF7260"/>maſter of buſineſs, and had acquired an hundred thouſand pair of boots and ſpurs, when he died. Now if this was really the caſe, I believe it would be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily granted, that a life of ſuch buſineſs was as poor and ridiculous as any that can be invented. But it would puzzle any one to ſhew, that a man that has ſpent all his time and thoughts in buſineſs and hurry, that he might die, as it is ſaid, worth an hundred thouſand pounds, has done more good for himſelf, than he who has taken the ſame pains to have as many of any thing elſe, when he leaves the world. For if the temper and ſtate of our ſouls be our whole ſtate; if the only end of life be to die as free from ſin, and exalted in virtue, as we can; if naked as we came, ſo naked we are to return, and to ſtand a trial before Chriſt and his holy angels, for everlaſting happineſs or miſery, what can it poſſibly ſignify what a man had or had not, in this world? What can it ſignify, what you call thoſe things, which a man has left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him; whether you call them his, or any one's elſe; whether you call them trees or fields, or birds or feathers; whether you call them an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, or an hundred thouſand pair of boots. I ſay, call them; for the things ſignify no more to him than the names. Now as it is eaſy to ſee the folly of a life thus ſpent, there needs no better faculty of ſeeing, no finer underſtanding, to ſee the folly of a life ſpent in making a man poſſeſſor of ten towns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dies; for if, when he has got all his towns or all his boots, his ſoul is to go to his own place among ſeparate ſpirits, and his body to be laid by in a coffin, till the laſt trumpet calls him to judgment; where the inquiry will be, how humbly, how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly, how purely, how meekly and charitably we have ſpoke, thought and acted, whilſt we were in the body; how can we ſay, that he who has wore out his life in raiſing an hundred thouſand pounds, has acted wiſer for himſelf, than he who has had the ſame care to procure an hundred thouſand of any thing elſe. But farther: Let it now be ſuppoſed, that <hi>Negotius,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:011654_0008_0F87C9E12602FCD0"/>when he firſt entered into buſineſs, happening to read the goſpel with attention and eyes opened, found that he had a much greater buſineſs upon his hands, than that to which he had ſerved an apprenticeſhip; that there were things which belong to man, of much more importance than all that our eyes can ſee; ſo glorious as to deſerve all our thoughts, ſo dangerous as to need all our care, and ſo certain as never to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the faithful labourer. If <hi>Negotius,</hi> believing theſe things to be true, had entirely devoted himſelf to God at his firſt ſetting out in the world, reſolving to purſue his buſineſs no farther than was conſiſtent with great devotion, humility and ſelf-denial; and for no other ends, but to provide himſelf with a ſober ſubſiſtence, and to do all the good that he could to the ſouls and bodies of his fellow-creatures. Now, had this been the Chriſtian ſpirit of <hi>Negotius,</hi> can any one who is truly in his ſenſes, ſay he had loſt any degree of true joy and happineſs, by thus conforming to the ſpirit of Chriſtianity: And yet I doubt not, but worldly Chriſtians of every denomination will oppoſe, and endeavour to diſcredit ſuch a repreſentation of Chriſtianity; but when you repreſent to your mind, how Chriſtians ought to live unto God, and in what degree of wiſdom and holineſs they ought to uſe the things of this life, you muſt not look at the world, which lies in wickedneſs, and whoſe wiſdom is fooliſhneſs with God; but you muſt look towards heaven. You muſt with the eyes of faith penetrate into the inviſible world, the world of ſpirits, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider your order and condition among them; you muſt endeavour, by the help of grace, to put in practice the higheſt precepts of the goſpel; you muſt think, how departed ſouls would live, if they were again to act the ſhort part of human life, and what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of wiſdom and holineſs you will wiſh for, when you are leaving this world. Now, this is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to ourſelves any needleſs perfection; it is but barely complying with the precepts of the goſpel, which requires, that we <hi>be holy in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:011654_0009_0F87C9E1A1B79398"/>And as the holineſs of Chriſtianity conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates all eſtates and employments of life unto God, ſo are we more eſpecially obliged to obſerve this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious exactneſs in the uſe of our eſtates and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, becauſe, if we waſte them, we don't waſte a trifle, that ſignifies little; but we waſte that, which might be made as eyes to the blind, as a huſband to the widow, and as a father to the orphan. If a man had eyes, hands and feet, that he could give to thoſe that wanted them; if he ſhould either lock them up in a cheſt, or pleaſe himſelf with ſome needleſs and ridiculous uſe of them, inſtead of giving them to his brethren that were blind and lame; ſhould we not juſtly reckon him an inhuman wretch, if he ſhould rather chuſe to amuſe himſelf with furniſhing his houſe with thoſe things, than to entitle himſelf to an eternal reward, by giving them to thoſe that wanted eyes and hands; might we not juſtly reckon him mad? for after we have ſatisfied our own ſober and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wants, all the reſt of our money is like ſpare eyes and hands; ſomething that can only be well uſed, by giving it to thoſe that want it. Theſe tempers and this uſe of our worldly goods, is ſo much the doctrine of all the New Teſtament, that you can't read a chapter without being taught of it, particularly that remarkable paſſage at <hi>Matth.</hi> 25:31, 46.</p>
            <p>The life of the pious lady <hi>Elizabeth Haſtings</hi> is an extraordinary inſtance of the happy effect which Christianity has upon thoſe who by joining with the calls of grace, become willing to give up their whole hearts to follow its dictates. This pious lady's firſt principle appears to have been the Glory of God, and the purity of her own heart; next to this a continual ſolicitude and labour to hold all her capacities, all her power and all her fortunes continually upon ſtretch for the good of all men, weeping with thoſe that wept; rejoicing with thoſe that rejoiced; given to hoſpitality; diſtributing to the neceſſity of the ſaints, and to thoſe that were leſs ſo, having joy at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a ſinner, or the leaſt appearance of it; but
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011654_0010_0F87C9E261D44740"/>the care of all her cares was the ſtranger, the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and the widow, the needy, and he that hath no helper, the lame, the halt and the blind. And in this place, ſays the author of her life, what ſhall I ſay! or how can I expect to be believed! The bent of her ſpirit ever lay towards theſe: She had a ſhare in all their ſufferings; ſhe would often converſe with them, and enquire into their hiſtory, with as much poverty of ſpirit, as they were in of outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; ſhe would ſtudy their particular caſes, and put them in the way of better welfare. Some of theſe were ever in her houſe, and frequently in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and it was no neglect of her's, if any one went away unrelieved with meat, phyſic, raiment or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; many of theſe that lived remote, had yearly allowances, and large ſums frequently iſſued out into diſtant parts of the kingdom. Her ſtill larger appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations were fixed penſions upon reduced families, the maintenance of her own charity-ſchool, contributions to others, &amp;c. &amp;c. She was a great miſtreſs of all parts of oeconomy, with reſpect to what ſhe laid out upon herſelf. Her body, ſhe knew, was the temple of the Holy Ghoſt, which the believer muſt poſſeſs in ſanctification and honour, wherefore her ſupport of it in meat, drink and ſleep was ever bounded by neceſſity; for they that walk in the Spirit, as this pious lady did, die progreſſively to every vanity, and dare not indulge the hurtful gratifications of the fleſh, but labour to keep it under, as knowing it to be the ſeat and repoſitory of their moſt dangerous and deadly enemy. Nevertheleſs ſhe ſought not her ſalvation by the force of her alms, highly affluent as they were; for theſe, though neceſſary duties, yet, ſhe well knew, were not the charity of the goſpel; not that charity which the Apoſtle Paul ſo divinely deſcribes at 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13:3. She was ſenſible, that Jeſus Chriſt muſt be revealed in the heart, before we can have any juſt claim to diſcipleſhip, and that it is his ruling and bringing all things there in ſubjection to his Spirit that was the great and only principle of Chriſtian
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011654_0011_0F87C9E478433A90"/>charity. She knew, that the great ſcene of religion lay within, in the right government of the heart; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly her eye was ever upon her heart, to ſee that all its principles were cleanſed from evil mixtures, had no taint from ſelf-love, were not ſullied with vain-glory; her care was to obſerve the tendency of all its motions, how its ſtruggles weakened in ſinful deſires, endeavouring continually to nouriſh it by acts of faith and in the blood of her Redeemer. She had well learnt to overcome evil with good, to ſuffer long and be kind, to bear all things, and if ever by ſpeech, carriage or otherwiſe ſhe ſuſpected, that ſhe had diſturbed the ſpirit of any, ſhe had no peace with herſelf till ſhe had taken care for the recovery of theirs.</p>
            <p>Much more might be ſaid of the endowments and virtues of this true diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt, more eſpecially of her patience under ſufferings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to Divine will; under the painful diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe paſſed through, during the laſt eighteen months of her life, occaſioned by a cancer in her breaſt, which, notwithſtanding ſhe ſuffered it to be ſeparated from her body, yet in the end occaſioned her death. This painful operation ſhe not only bore with patience, but even rejoiced, that ſhe was counted worthy to ſuffer, knowing her Saviour had ſuffered in his fleſh, and that, as ſufferings was the way to his perfection, it muſt alſo be the way to ours, this being the declared condition of our being glorified with him; the trueſt marks of adoption, and the moſt ſovereign medicine ſent from heaven for our cure. Theſe truths this truly pious Lady was ſo well acquainted with, that ſhe declared, <hi>She would not wiſh to be out of her preſent ſituation, nor exchange it for any other at any price.</hi> Thus with great meekneſs and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, with chearfulneſs ſcarce to be believed, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſerenity and freedom, ſhe continued her uſual life till the time appointed for the operation. When that time of deep trial came, ſhe ſhewed no reluctance or ſtruggle, but endured all even without complaint;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011654_0012_0F87C9E4A082C8D0"/>only towards the end ſhe drew ſuch a ſigh, as the compaſſionate reader who reads this, may do. Hence it appears, how thoſe that follow the Lamb with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, are endowed with virtue and power reſulting from the true ſpirit of his religion, which others are unacquainted with. The night following the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not indeed a night of much ſleep, but of truly celeſtial reſt; a night of thankſgiving to her God for the viſible demonſtration of his power in her and about her, for his ſtretch'd-out arm in her great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, for the bountiful proviſion her had made for her body and ſoul, holding all the powers of her ſpirit exerciſed in acts of love, gratitude and adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. She ſooner than was expected got upon her feet, and, with every improvement that could be made, into the ſame way of life that ſhe had been in before, wholly intent upon the glory of God, and the good of her fellow-creatures. But the diſtemper, only repreſſed for a time, roſe upon with great malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to the much greater affliction of numbers in the world, than of her that bore it; for ſhe had now been, for ſome time, in the ſchool of affliction, exerciſed with its ſharp diſcipline, and found its ſalutary effects. Under theſe ſentiments her hope was full of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and the eternal weight of glory, now in full view, made all her afflictions light. In this near and certain approach of death, her cheriſhing warmth, like that of the ſun, though it might be moſt felt by thoſe neareſt, yet alſo reached thoſe at greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; witneſs the great numbers of letters ſhe writ, and dictated to others when ſhe became unable to write, full of ſweet counſel, having for their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the bleſſedneſs of piety; preſſing home the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it, and ſetting forth its true nature; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alſo the number of perſons of all conditions who reſorted at her houſe, to behold the living power of religion in her, and to be benefited by her wiſdom. With ſome of theſe ſhe continued in heavenly confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as long as ſhe had ſtrength. Her life was near drawing to its laſt ſtage; but her lamp and her life
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011654_0013_0F87C9E55E8293D0"/>muſt be extinguiſhed together, and ſhe muſt occupy till her Lord comes. Accordingly ſhe convened her houſhold, to ſtrengthen and enforce every thing that ſhe had done or ſhewn them before, by her dying counſels; and would have extended this care to the whole village, but was reſtrained by the phyſician. <hi>The path of the juſt is as a ſhining light, which ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day.</hi> 
               <q>The truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, whoſe evidences for heaven are clear, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and well grounded, have a tide of joy ſpringing up in their minds beyond expreſſion; ſomething more moving and ſatisfactory than any one can imagine, but they that perceive it.—When they are juſt entering upon the promiſed land, the ſplendor of the eternal day dawns upon them, and ſhines as through the breaches of their ſhattered bodies, and raiſes in the inward man ſuch earneſt of happineſs, ſuch foretaſtes of joy, as enables them to paſs through the valley of death in peace and triumph.</q> As death drew near, ſhe was in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, quite melted down with the impreſſion of glory, 'broke out with a raiſed accent into theſe words: <hi>Bleſs me, Lord! what is that I ſee!—Oh! the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the glory that is revealed in me,—that is before me.</hi> And ſome time after ſhe had ſo ſaid, ſhe fell aſleep.</p>

               <hi>A Chriſtian's daily Converſation with</hi> GOD, Exemplified in a ſhort Extract OF THE Holy Life of ARMELLE NICOLAS.</head>
            <p>THE perſon, whoſe daily converſation is here deſcribed, was not long ſince a poor ſimple country maid, and ſervant to a great family in <hi>France.</hi> The whole courſe of her life was very inſtructive, and a moſt ſhining pattern of a true ſpiritual conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011654_0014_0F87C9E639606E48"/>'Tis remarkable, that this perſon who ſerved God with ſuch unwearied prayer and watchfulneſs, was ſo ignorant, that ſhe could neither read nor write, and was in the ſtation of a ſervant, conſtantly employed in buſineſs and hard labour. Hence we ſee, that the true ſervice of God is ſpiritual, univerſal, plain and eaſy, ſo that no perſon can be excuſed from it by any pretence whatſoever.</p>
            <p>'Tis not ſo much the changing of places, or names, or modes and forms, or of any thing without us, as the changing of our will and heart, that will render our ſervice acceptable to God. Hence the ſcripture declaring, what ſort of change is to be wrought in a ſoul, requires a tranſlation from darkneſs to light, (<hi>Acts</hi> 26:18.) from death to life, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 2:5.) and from being loſt to be found again.</p>
            <p>The Lord give his grace to all that heartily deſire it, always to walk before him after ſuch a pious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as this devout ſoul did! whereof ſhe herſelf gave the following account to the author of her life.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I wake in the morning, I throw myſelf into the arms of my heavenly love, as a child into the arms of his father. I riſe with a deſign to ſerve and pleaſe him, and if I have time to pray, I fall upon my knees in his holy preſence, and ſpeak to him as if I really ſaw him with my bodily eyes. I give my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up wholly to him, and deſire him to fulfil all his holy will in me, and that he would not ſuffer me that day to do the leaſt thing which might be offenſive to him. In ſhort, I love and praiſe him as much and as long as my affairs permit; though very often I have hardly ſo much time as to ſay the Lord's prayer. But I do not trouble myſelf about that; for I have God always in my heart, as well when I am about my buſineſs, which I do in obedience to his will, as when I retire on purpoſe to pray to him. This he himſelf has taught me, that whatever I do out of love to him, is a real prayer.</p>
            <p>I dreſs myſelf in his preſence, and he ſhews me that his love ſupplies me with raiment. And when
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011654_0015_0F87C9E6DAA37D10"/>I go about my buſineſs, even then doth he not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me, nor I him, but he converſes with me; yea, I am then as much united to him, as when I am at my prayers, ſet apart on purpoſe for my ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection. O! how ſweet and eaſy is all labour and toil in ſuch good company! Sometimes I perceive ſuch ſtrength and ſupport in my mind, that nothing is to hard for me. Nothing but the body is at work, the heart and myſelf burn with love to God.</p>
            <p>When the body begins to be weary, or to repine, or to deſire unſeaſonable reſt, being oppreſſed with uneaſineſs; my divine love enlightens me forthwith, and ſhews me how I ought to ſuppreſs thoſe rebellious motions of corrupt nature, and not to nouriſh them at all, either by word or deed. This love keeps the door of my lips, and watches over my heart, that it may not in the leaſt contribute to ſuch irregular paſſions.</p>
            <p>But if, at any time, for want of care, I am ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed with theſe or the like faults, I cannot be at reſt till I have obtained pardon, and God be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to me. I lie proſtrate before his foot-ſtool, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing all my faults to him, and there I continue till he has forgiven me, renewed his friendſhip with me, and confirmed it more than before. If people perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute me, and by foul and uncharitable cenſures raiſe ſcandals upon me, or any other way afflict me; or if evil ſpirits attack me with their crafty and cunning temptations, I then preſently run to my heavenly Love, who readily ſtretches forth his ſacred arms to receive me, ſhewing me his heart and wounds open for my ſecurity, in which I hide myſelf as in a ſtrong caſtle and fortreſs. And then I am ſo mightily ſtrengthned, that if the whole army of hell itſelf, together with all the creatures, ſhould riſe up againſt me, I fear them not, becauſe I am under the protection of the moſt high God, his love being the hiding-place and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of my ſoul.</p>
            <p>If God at any time hides his face, making as if he would go away from me, I tell him, O! 'tis no
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011654_0016_0F87C9EC2E3A9C28"/>matter, my Love, conceal thyſelf as much as thou pleaſeſt, nevertheleſs I'll ſerve thee; for I know thou art my God. And then I ſtand upon my guard more than ever, to be faithful to him, for fear of diſpleaſing my Love. And at the ſame time perceiving the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my miſery and poverty, I inſiſt the more upon the merits of our Saviour, and reſolve to reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, tho' it ſhould pleaſe him to leave me all the days of my life in ſuch a condition. But he never lets me continue long under theſe circumſtances, and if I may venture ſo to ſpeak, he cannot forbear loving me, any more than I can live without him.</p>
            <p>If I am perſuaded on holidays to be merry in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, I excuſe myſelf. For nothing can be compared to the pleaſures of my Love, which are ſo much the ſweeter and greater for my withdrawing from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany whatſoever. If people wonder, how I can ſtay always at home alone, I think within myſelf: O! if you knew the glorious company I have, you would not ſay that I was alone; for I am never leſs alone, than when I have nobody with me.</p>
            <p>The night coming on, and every one going to reſt, I find reſt only in the arms of divine love: I ſleep leaning on his holy breaſt, like a child in his mother's boſom. I ſay, I go to ſleep, but being ſtill buſied about the love and praiſes of my God, till I fall quite aſleep. Many times this love rouſes up all my ſenſes, ſo that I cannot ſleep the greateſt part of the night, but I ſpend it in the embraces of the grace of God, which never forſakes ſuch a poor miſerable creature as I am, but preſerves me, and takes ſpecial care of me.</p>
            <p>If in the night the evil ſpirits hover about, to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or to ſurpriſe me, (which often happens) this divine love guards me, and fights for me. Yea, it gives me grace too, to reſiſt them courageouſly, as if I were awake. For they ſeldom continue long to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault me, unleſs it be in my ſleep.</p>
            <p>And this is the life I have led for theſe twenty years paſt, without perceiving the leaſt change of that
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011654_0017_0F87C9EE31ACB0A8"/>love which was poured out into my heart, after my ſincere converſion unto him. Nay, I have obſerved its daily increaſe, tho' every day it ſeemed impoſſible to endure any addition to what I already enjoy. But truly, it is an infinite love, which ſatisfies and nouriſhes me, ſo that every day I have a new hunger, tho' methinks I can receive no more, than what I poſſeſs already every moment.</p>
            <p>THE author of her life ſays, concerning the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of her expreſſions, that they were always very modeſt, without any noiſe or vehemence: her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſcourſes were always holy and edifying; whereas others too commonly mis-ſpend their time in uſeleſs converſation and unprofitable talk.</p>
            <p>For a long while ſhe could bear no other diſcourſe but of God and his holy love. <hi>I cannot imagine,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>how a ſoul, created for heaven, can be concerned about the droſs of this world.</hi> From that time, if ſhe happened to be in company, where the ſubject of the diſcourſe was but indifferent, either ſhe did not mind it at all, entertaining herſelf in the mean while with God; or, as ſoon as ſhe thought it proper, ſhe diverted and changed the diſcourſe; thinking it but loſt time, which was ſpent in this trifles of this world.</p>
            <p>To every body that had a mind to be acquainted with God Almighty, ſhe gave this advice: To be ſilent, and to learn to keep their thoughts together in the center of the heart: for this (ſaid ſhe) is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our union with God, and by theſe means the ſoul forgets earthly things, and raiſes herſelf up to the contemplation of heavenly objects. We ought to loſe our familiarity with the creatures, if we deſire to enjoy the converſation of the Creator, a moment of which doth afford more delight and ſatisfaction, than all the fineſt diſcourſes in the world.</p>
            <p>The real experience ſhe had of the inward and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life of grace, and of the manifold operations it was attended with, doth abundantly appear from the larger account of her life and converſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:011654_0018_0F87C9EEE10308D8"/>
One time when her miſtreſs was afraid that <hi>Armelle</hi> was like to run quite mad by an exceſs of devotion, ſhe forbad her all ſpiritual exerciſes, and would not let her go even to church, except on the Lord's day only: <hi>Armelle,</hi> being ſenſible of the falſe ſtep her miſtreſs took, ſmiled within herſelf, ſaying, Truly, I am not mad, after I have found my Beloved, whom I now love with all my heart. I remember a time, when I was ſeeking only God without me, and then I was mad indeed. This miſtreſs of hers being of a ſour and moroſe humour, ſhewed a deal of ill-nature to <hi>Armelle,</hi> of which, however, ſhe never complained, but rather thanked God, that he was pleaſed to make this a means of her fuller purification. Some ſeeing what ſhe ſuffered in hat houſe, adviſed her entirely to quit that place; ſhe replied, according to her uſual earneſtneſs: Why would you have me flee from the croſs which the Lord himſelf has entailed upon me? No, by no means: I ſhall never do it, except they turn me away by force. In which unexpected an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer her friends entirely acquieſced, never prompting her again to quit a place where ſhe had daily oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to practiſe patience and ſelf-denial; virtues ſo much contrary to the whole bent of corrupt nature, and yet ſo neceſſary for rightly framing a Chriſtian life and converſation. At another time ſhe ſaid: If the ſoul be but well grounded in the favour of God, and lively affected with the operations of his grace, all the inſults of the devil, and of the creatures, are borne with joy and comfort. But this is miſery indeed, when the Lord himſelf withdraws from the ſoul, and lets her ſhift for herſelf.</p>
            <p>In what company ſoever ſhe was, ſhe talked of nothing more, than of being <hi>faithful to God.</hi> Nothing dropped more from her mouth, than, <hi>Let us be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, let us be faithful to the Lord.</hi> This word ſhe thought fit for any time, and ſuitable to every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Being aſked by her friends, whether ſhe had nothing elſe to ſay, ſhe anſwered: Don't wonder at my ſaying this over and over again. If I ſhould
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011654_0019_0F87C9EF24274B78"/>live a thouſand years, I ſhould ſtill tell you the ſame thing. For 'tis faithfulneſs, wherein the perfection of a Chriſtian life conſiſts.</p>
            <p>Of the conſtraining power of the divine love ſhe has the following expreſſion: Whenever I happened to adhere a little too much to my natural inclinations, (apt to ſteal in upon the mind under the ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of neceſſity) I was immediately reproved by the love of God. This divine love is like a careful tutor, who takes all the pains imaginable for advancing his pupil in the way of learning he is engaged in; and for this reaſon keeps his eye conſtantly fixed on him, both to correct his failings, though never ſo ſmall, and to prevent his being led away by any thing that might divert him from his chief employment. Thus, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> dealt the Lord with me. He kept me cloſely confined to an holy awe and warineſs; and when I happened by one overſight or other to withdraw, as it were, from his eye, he in that very moment pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued after me, and recalled me to my duty. But all this was done with ſo much love and tenderneſs, that it muſt be a heart of braſs, if not mollified by ſuch endearing marks of love and kindneſs.</p>
            <p>She often wondered at ſome peoples dilatory doings in the ſervice of God, and ſaid, it was a cunning fetch and ſtratagem of the devil, to make people put off from one day to another ſuch deſigns as might ſerve to advance the glory of God, and the good of our fellow-creatures. <hi>For,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that that grace which at one hour offers itſelf to a man, in order to ſupport him under ſome difficult enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, is not ſo eaſily met with at another time.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, how uncertain is our life! nay, if we were ſure to live longer, yet ought we not to linger upon that account at all, nor to defer from one day to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other what might be done this day. A man that is full of delays in the ſervice of God, muſt needs have but little love at the bottom. <hi>Wherever love is raiſed to any eonſiderable degree, there the ſoul can't reſt, whilſt there remains any thing to be done required by the beloved.</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:011654_0020_0F87C9EFE0FF6B10"/>And this dilatory temper, <hi>ſhe ſaid,</hi> was a great in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment in the way to perfection. Many ſouls were convinced of the will of God, but being too back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conſtantly to ſtruggle againſt the corrupt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities of their dull and lazy temper, they made but a ſlow progreſs in the work of religion. They ſay, to-morrow, to-morrow it ſhall be done in good earneſt; but that to-morrow never comes. The conſequence whereof is, that the longer they flatter themſelves in their diſorderly and wonted cuſtoms, the leſs able they are to reſiſt them at laſt at all: the Lord leaves them now to their own will, ſince they did not improve faithfully what once they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>Her humility was alſo grounded on a true and ſolid foundation. She confeſſes, that the infinite love of God kept her undefiled as to the vanity of pride. I was aſtoniſhed, ſays ſhe, when I was told to watch againſt pride, for I thought whilſt I was well in my wits, I could not poſſibly be proud. I was ſo fully convinced that every thing really good was from God, that if all angels and men had offered to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap> me to the contrary, I ſhould never have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them. And this ſenſe fortified me againſt every kind of pride.</p>
            <p>Becauſe her love to God was ſo great and fervent, the love ſhe bore to her fellow-creatures was alſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully influenced and inflamed thereby. When ſhe conſidered the woful ſtate of the wicked, and the dreadful judgment that is like to befal them at laſt, ſhe then felt a more tender and commiſerating love, and her very bowels began to yearn for compaſſion. When ſhe looked upon the happy ſtate ſhe was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to, and the ſevere doom attending ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate wretches, ſhe uſed to ſay, ſhe ſeemed unto herſelf like one that had been in a great ſtorm at ſea, and by ſtreſs of weather like to be caſt away every minute; but getting off at laſt ſafe and ſound, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered now aſhore the dangers his brethren and near relations were ſtill expoſed to, being toſſed up
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011654_0021_0F87C9F09EC3D6D8"/>and down in the huge ocean, and left to the mercy of the roaring billows. Alas! ſaid ſhe, thus it is with me, when I lay to heart the danger ſinners run themſelves into. For the more endearing marks of divine grace the Lord has been pleaſed to beſtow upon me, the more fervent is my deſire, that alſo others might partake of the ſame with me.</p>
            <p>AND now, ye learned men, and refined wits of the age, come hither and admire the ignorance and ſimplicity of this poor country-maid! Conſider how far ſhe exceeds your high flown ſuperficial wiſdom, and the dark flaſhes of human wit and learning? And was it poſſible for her to attain to this <hi>heavenly wiſdom and divine knowledge,</hi> to ſuch a nobleneſs and elevation of mind, without the ſcraps and aſſiſtance of artificial learning and philoſophy? then truly there muſt be another ſchool wherein thoſe that <hi>flow unto the Lord,</hi> (Pſ. 34:5) <hi>are lighted.</hi> Indeed <hi>to know the love of Chriſt, paſſeth all knowledge,</hi> Eph. 3:19. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which our Saviour was pleaſed thus to expreſs his grateful ſentiments with hearty joy and heavenly triumph: <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes. Even ſo, Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight,</hi> Matth. 11:25, 26. <hi>For it is written,</hi> (ſays St. Paul) <hi>I will deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe, and will bring to nothing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the prudent? Where is the wiſe? where is the ſcribe? where is the diſputer of this world? But God hath choſen the fooliſh things of this world, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the wiſe; and God hath choſen the weak things of the world, to confound the things which are mighty. And baſe things of the world, and things, which are deſpiſed, hath God choſen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are. That no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence,</hi> 1 Cor. 1:19, 20, 27, 28, 29. Iſa. 29:14. Chap. 33:18.</p>

            <head>THOUGHTS ON Impartiality and Goſpel Love, Recommended to the Notice OF THE Truly Pious of every Chriſtian Profeſſion.</head>
            <p>THE inſpiration of God and the clear infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the holy ſcripture aſſures us, that God reſerves his choiceſt ſecrets for the pureſt minds, and that true holineſs is the only ſafe entrance into divine knowledge. The apoſtle declares, <hi>Acts</hi> 10:34, <hi>That he perceived of a truth, that God is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecter of perſons; but in every nation, he that feareth him and worketh righteouſneſs, is accepted with him.</hi> Yet, notwithſtanding the clearneſs of this and many more ſuch doctrines contained in the ſcripture, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhneſs and partiality, thoſe inhuman and baſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, are ſuffered to prevail even amongſt ſuch as are eſteemed the moſt pious in the ſeveral diviſions of the Chriſtian church, ſo as to raiſe a flight, and often a kind of enmity, againſt thoſe of other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions. Nevertheleſs, the truly pious-hearted of every party are indeed nearer to one another than many of them apprehend; and it would on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience be found, that if each particular diviſion of Chriſtianity could produce but one man a piece, that had the piety of an apoſtle, and the impartial love of the firſt Chriſtians, they would not want half a ſheet of paper to hold the articles of union, nor be half an hour before they were of one religion, however they may differ in ſome external practices. If we ſought truth for its own ſake; if we loved our neighbour as ourſelves; and, if we deſired nothing by our religion, but to be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011654_0023_0F87C9F21BB2C648"/>to God, this partial ſpirit would have no place with us. That univerſal love, which gives the whole ſtrength of the heart to God, and makes us love every man as we love ourſelves, is the nobleſt, the moſt divine and Godlike ſtate of the ſoul; and religion does people very little good, but ſo far as it brings this perfect love with it. Perfection can no where be found, but in a pure, diſintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed love of God and our neighbour. There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a communion of ſaints in the love of God, which no one can learn from that which is called orthodoxy in the different ſects, but is only to be had by a total dying to all worldly views, by a pure love of God, and by ſuch an unction from above, as delivers the mind from ſelfiſhneſs, and makes it love truth and goodneſs with an equality of affection in every man, let his name and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to religion be what it may. And by thus uniting in heart and ſpirit with all that is holy and good in all profeſſions, we enter into the true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of ſaints, and become real members of the true univerſal Chriſtian church. It is thus, that the angels, as miniſtring ſpirits, aſſiſt, join, unite and co-operate with every thing that is holy and good in every diviſion of mankind. He that has been all his life long uſed to look with great ſlight upon thoſe of other profeſſion, muſt naturally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, they will be treated by God, as they have been by him; and if he had the keys of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven, ſuch people would find it hard to get a place in it. But it ſtands us greatly in hand to get rid of this temper before we die; for if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but univerſal love can enter into the kingdom of God, what can be more neceſſary for us, than to be full of this love before we die?</p>
            <p>We ſometimes hear people of great zeal declare on their deathbeds their ſtrict attachment to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular profeſſion to which they belong, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their diſunity with all other churches; but
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011654_0024_0F87C9F9296AC498"/>how much better would it be, if ſuch a perſon was to ſay: In this divided ſtate of Chriſtendom, I have choſen to live and die in outward communion with the ſociety to which I am joined; fully believing, that if I worſhip God in ſpirit and in truth in this divided part of the church, I ſhall be as acceptable to him, as if I had been a faithful member of the one whole church, before it was broken into ſeparate parts. But as I am now going out of this diſordered divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, into a more univerſal ſtate of things, as I am going to the God of all churches, to a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of univerſal love, which muſt have its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants from all people, nations and languages of the earth; ſo in this ſpirit of univerſal love, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to perform my laſt act of communion, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in heart and ſpirit with all that is Chriſtian, holy and good in all other churches; praying from the bottom of my ſoul, that every church may have its ſaints; that God's kingdom may come, his will be done in every diviſion of Chriſtians and men, and that every thing that hath breath, may praiſe the Lord!</p>
