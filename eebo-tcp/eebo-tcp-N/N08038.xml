            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the appearance, which is not of man, nor according to man, I looked, and beheld a great mountain;</p>
            <p n="1">1—2 And thereon ſtood candleſticks of gold, of ſilver, of braſs and iron, and in them were candles, ſome of them burning bright and clear, and ſome appeared dull, and almoſt gone out, and ſome were gone out quite.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And others were covered with <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> out, and ſome of them overthrown; and whilſt I was looking off the walls of the mountain, which was built of pure gold and precious ſtones,</p>
            <p n="4">4 There appeared a numerous company from another coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, following <hi>ignus fatus,</hi> and their leader rode a ſcarlet colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beaſt, and his name was Oppreſſion and Defence; and when they that ſat in darkneſs upon the mountain, ſaw the multitude which came forth, they went forth from the mountain, and broke over the precious walls that were round it, and went to the leader of the multitude, and honoured him with great honour, and ſome joined with him in his hoſt, and followed <hi>ignus fatus,</hi> and they rejoiced, ſaying, We will do valiently, for our God is with us, and we will tread down our enemies, and every one that riſeth up to oppreſs us; and others gave him money and many great gifts, ſaying, Go forth with thy army, and bear down thoſe ſtorms and tempeſts.</p>
            <p n="5">5 So he went forth with his company, and fought againſt, but could not prevail; and they which remained in darkneſs upon the mountain <hi>(a),</hi> made war with the golden candleſticks, whoſe light appeared bright, and ceaſed not from ſhining; but they were not able ſo much as to dim the light thereof neither they nor the tempeſts that beat againſt them; For they <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p n="8">8 And ſuddenly the walls, which were of gold and precious ſtones, were taken away from about the mountain, and the wild boar of the foreſt entered into the borders thereof, and raged in his fury, for his chains were looſed <hi>(a),</hi> and he was releaſed out of his priſon, and began to remove many candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, and aſſayed to deſtroy the whole mountain, and the cry of the widow and orphans began to be heard in the land, and they were greatly diſtreſſed who truſted in the holy name of JESUS, whoſe light ſtill appeared; and they mourned and wept for the candleſticks that were removed out of their places and for the golden walls that were taken from about them <hi>(b).</hi>

            <p n="19">19 And behold, the wind of heaven aroſe, and blew upon the mountain, and the waters of a great river came forth, and paſſed over the mountain, and there was a great earthquake, and after that a great furnace, whoſe burning was as the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of lime, and the candleſticks of ſilver, of braſs and of iron were caſt into the furnace, and the fire thereof burned in them, and all they which came forth out of the furnace, were as pure gold; but they which came not out, were no more, but as fuel of fire, and many golden candleſticks were refined therein; and as I looked, there appeared candles in all of them which came out of the furnace, which were all of pure gold <hi>(a)</hi> ſet round with precious ſtones.</p>
            <p n="20">20 And one of great power rent the heavens above, and came down, having in his right hand a live coal, which he had taken from the holy altar of the moſt high God, and he touched the candles therewith, and the light appeared; and I looked, and the waters of the great river aſſuaged, and there was a calm <hi>(a),</hi> and the golden candleſticks (which were <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

            <head>THE EXPLANATION.</head>
            <p n="1">1 THIS mountain is the Quaker profeſſion, or yearly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in Pennſylvania.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Shews the members, under the term of candleſticks, and thoſe who were born ſons. By candles, and thoſe which ſhined bright, were ſuch who bore a clear teſtimony againſt the idol diſcipline: They had not only oil in their lamps, but lighted alſo, and burning bright.</p>
            <p n="3">3 As thoſe in this verſe, being covered, ſhews ſome, who, in their private opinion, were one with the bright ones; their lamps were alſo lighted, but kept under cover, for fear of the yearly meeting authority, and ſelect party:—Whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, to deal with ſuch who could not conform to diſcipline, were the clouds that carried thoſe ſtorms which darkened the light of the Spirit of God in almoſt all the members minds; and as ſome were overthrown, it ſhews that ſome were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by thoſe ſtorms, and their faith ſailed in the light of Chriſt, in their own hearts; and they put their truſt in, and depended upon the wall for ſecurity, which was diſcipline; being built of, or compoſed of ſuch laws and rules as was truly the inward law of God's own Spirit; that is, where men truly, by the dictates of God's own Spirit, made conſcience of things, and according as they walked, as to outward actions, by the leading of that Spirit;—this was collected into writing, and made into a law of diſcipline; thus was this idol, or wall, in which they truſted, made of precious ſtones.</p>
            <p n="4">4 But this company, from another country, ſhews the natural man acting, exactly in all outward appearance, to this law, while yet ſtrangers to the work of converſion; following the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of this diſcipline and orders, ſenſe, judgments and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments of the meetings of buſineſs, which is <hi>ignus fatus,</hi> for every man and woman that ever acted in any ſervice of a religious nature, by virtue of their appointment from a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo far as that appointment was their warrant, or motive of inducement, ſo far they followed <hi>ignus fatus,</hi> whoſe prime leader to all the inferior meetings, is the authority of the yearly meeting. This authority is the ſcarlet coloured beaſt; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſcarlet is the kingly colour here in the kingdom of England; and it is to ſignify, that it has a ſhew of kingly or royal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: And as in its very nature it oppreſſes, which begets defence, ſo oppreſſion and defence is its proper name. (That its very nature is to oppreſs, will be ſhewn at large in a work now preparing for the preſs, wherein the myſtery of <hi>Babylon</hi> will
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010258_0009_0F7E24735276F978"/>
be fully ſhewn and demonſtrated to be moſt compleat in the Quakers.) The natural man, thus acting according to the very exact copy of the living world, while yet entire ſtrangers to it, deceived thoſe who had once known it, and were darkened again by this great outward ſhew; ſo that they went forth from the true living word of God, in their own heart, which was going out of the very profeſſion: Omitting juſtice and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is alſo breaking over the rule, becauſe this is the end and deſign; and breaking over the very wall, whole very firſt foundation was laid by the firſt Quakers, not to ſtir or act but in God's power only; but inſtead thereof, their eyes are turned to the leader of this multitude, namely, the orders and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the yearly meeting; him they honour, and in that they truſt, and alſo rejoice; yea, alſo ſay, that we will do valiantly, for our God is with us. It is high time to riſe againſt the mighty, (has been a common ſaying in meetings of buſineſs, by the ſelect party) meaning ſuch who call the authority of the body of friends in queſtion, and the authority of the yearly meeting. Let the diſcipline be put in practice, and compare this with the latter part of this verſe; as alſo, the yearly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections to print epiſtles, with private gifts to traveling friends, who are valiant for this cauſe; obſerve alſo by the way, that though, as hinted in (3), thoſe committees were the very clouds, ſet to work by this authority, which carried or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned all contention, tempeſts and ſtorms, or ſtrife; yet they themſelves aſſigned the cauſe to an oppoſite ſpirit.—Having ſet the reader on the tract or true ſent of the meaning of this viſion, ſhall now but juſt give a hint of matters in ſhort, in order to leſſen the bulk of the book.</p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>(a)</hi> Such who had known the truth, made war alſo <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thoſe whoſe light ſhined to diſcover this falſe idol diſcipline but could not dim it. Witneſs that nine years ago the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the yearly meeting was ſcarce queſtioned; Quakers were ſtartled, (as I remember <hi>J-n C-n</hi> ſaid, I marveled at it) if any drop'd ſuch an expreſſion: And now it is become a fire ſide and table talk. Thoſe tempeſts here relate to the diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thrown in the way, as calling us heathens, ranters, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts; and the works (or uſe made of them) of <hi>Barclay's</hi> Anarchy, <hi>Ellwood</hi>'s works, and others, on or touching this point, who had once known the truth. This proves a hard labour, even if it were poſſible to deceive the very elect; yet a number has witneſſed all this, not ſo much as able to dim the light for they laboured diligently, and found the pearl of great price, that is, appealed only to the witneſs of truth in their own hearts; this is the tower againſt the moſt plauſible out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance.</p>
            <p n="6">6 <hi>(a)</hi> Meetings, conferences, &amp;c. <hi>(b),</hi> let us make a new rule of diſcipline; (now began the diſcipline to vary from being
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010258_0010_0F7E247626218920"/>
a true copy of the living word) <hi>(c);</hi> diſcipline, with all its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and amendments, ſaid to be all done by the voice of God and his wiſdom, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="7">7 <hi>(a)</hi> This one was the voice of truth in the ſons of God, or ſons of the free woman, that cried againſt this diſcipline, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, memorials, &amp;c. <hi>(b)</hi> The wall of this tower, being ſure, alludes to the other as not ſure: <hi>(c)</hi> This; ſhews, they truſt to this diſcipline, as a things of their own ſtrength; though of pure gold, and precious ſtones. <hi>(d)</hi> Forgot to ſet truth and honeſty, and the ſpirit which trades it, above rule and order. <hi>(e)</hi> Let truth yet remain, under the name of the ſociety.</p>
            <p n="8">8 <hi>(a)</hi> This was quite obvious, for the ſerpent had twiſted himſelf, and mixed to ſuch with the truth, that it was difficult for the ſons of God, to ſtrike at this great order and authority, without giving encouragement to a libertine ſpirit. So when peoples eyes began to be opened, the libertine and vain broke looſe, who were chained down by the remains of the power and function that went with the order and authority of ſuch who had acted truly in God's power; for this power had in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure remained till it was removed by a diſcovery of the cheat. <hi>(b)</hi> This wild boar aſſayed, in its fury, to overrun the pure power and word of life, as well as the falſe, which cauſed the widow and orphan to be diſtreſſed; that is, thoſe who were motherleſs and fatherleſs, or forſaken of the yearly meeting, namely, the golden ones, who had cried againſt order and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline <hi>(a),</hi> or the ſin of <hi>Onan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9 <hi>(b)</hi> This covenant is made between God and every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſoul, where it covenants in the ſecret of its ſoul, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the light and convictions of God's Spirit in his own heart, on penalty of his eternal wrath, and willingly covenants its being the day of God's power in the ſoul. And it is fitting to obſerve here, that God tries the ſoul, upon the conditions of its covenant, which ſometimes will be to prohibit it from lawful things: And among Quakers, we find of late, they are tried with a breach of diſcipline, may be to riſe in prayer, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, before they are received in unity, by the paper god; as <hi>E—b A—b,</hi> and others I could produce.</p>
            <p n="10">10 This verſe foreſheweth a peculiar day of grace and light at hand; for though this day is to be deſired, yet while the ſoul paſſes through the furnace, it is not pleaſant, at the preſent, and this grievouſly torment the Phariſee ſpirit, (or ſelect party) as our dictionaries explain the word.—Gnaſhing of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> there will be, when they behold God's power, working in oppoſition to them, and their idol god: Then Jeruſalem will be encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with armies, and Quaker Phariſees will be in the Jewiſh condition, when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was taken, after Chriſt was put to death.</p>
            <p n="11">11 This is ſpoke of outward famine and ſword, even the dry
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010258_0011_0F7E2476A0257A18"/>
unnatural ſeaſons and Indian war; for as the kernel of a nut is encloſed with a rind, and then a ſhell, the nearer to the kernel, the more reſembling the ſubſtance; even ſo this Indian war and outward ſociety of Quakers, and contention and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies between them and other ſects, is the rind or ſhell which encloſed the kernel of the viſion; and has ſo near a reſemblance, that them who dwell in the outward court, can form an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect explanation of it outwardly, alſo points towards the truth or kernel.</p>
            <p n="12">12 <hi>(a)</hi> Thoſe were not the ſelect party, nor thoſe who ſat in the gallery ſeats, with their certificates and authority of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, rich broadcloths and line white beavers. Theſe have been far from that low, meek appearance of Jeſus's true meſſengers, who ever yet have been rejected of men and the body of the church. <hi>(b)</hi> All affliction of body is faſting, as abſtinence from converge, reading news papers, or other worldly matters <hi>(c);</hi> they thirſt to kill the character of ſuch who keep to truth, whereby their wickedneſs is uncovered, and honour and reputation of ſociety ſtained.</p>
            <p n="13">13 This river is the ſame enemy, ſuffered to come; not the boar nor ſword, but is the voice of God, ſent out in writing, as well as verbal teſtimonies, which will come out ſo thick, as to overflow and ſweep away all tradition, ſenſe and judgment of weighty friends (ſo called) out of mens minds, to ſerve the living God, and not idols, compoſed of a body of men and women.</p>
            <p n="14">14 <hi>(a)</hi> Many who acted by diſcipline, ſhall ſtrive to reconcile their paſt conduct to the light, but none ſhall be able but ſuch as bore an open teſtimony againſt it; theſe ſhall now reap the fruit of their labour in this life, ſaying, No diſcipline, order, or yearly meeting advices has been of the leaſt good ſervice.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Wild nature ſhew many by fornication, drunkenneſs, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and unuſual publick wickedneſs abounding; and the ſelect party roſe up, and fought againſt it with their diſcipline and preparations of war, and wounded it a little, and cried out to ſuch, who they perceived a ſlackneſs in of attending their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of buſineſs, to come forward, and join in the Lord's work, &amp;c. and power was given them to ſet at nought ſuch as did not attend meetings of buſineſs, and join with the ſelect party, but contended againſt the diſcipline, queries, &amp;c. thoſe were ſet at nought, and contemn'd, as not concerned, to ariſe to help, but enemies to the work of God; and by this oppreſſion and outſide beauty of this order ſome who had known the truth, joined in this work of diſcipline.</p>
            <p n="16">16 <hi>(a)</hi> Ceaſed oppoſing diſcipline, and cried for the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wickedneſs in the ſociety.</p>
