            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE neceſſity of a well regulated government in civil States, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all; and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and benefit of true Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, in order thereto, is no leſs certain. For the great Author of it aſſures us, that his diſciples are the <hi>ſalt</hi> of the earth, and the <hi>light</hi> of the world, Mat. 5.13, 14. That is, his religion is as neceſſary for the well-being of human ſociety, as ſalt is to preſerve from putrifaction, or as light is to direct our way, and to guard againſt enemies, confuſion, and miſery. This is evident, becauſe 1ſt, The univerſal rule of equity, enjoined by our Lord, has the moſt natural and effectual tendency to promote extenſive union of any means in the world: And both our friends and our enemies know, that our ſalvation and welfare, as a people, greatly depends thereupon. 2d, His precepts plainly require, the yielding to all their dues, faithfulneſs in every ſtation, benevolence to all, and the working ill to none. 3d, A regard to all theſe things is enforced with the certain promiſes of his help and bleſſings, for time and eternity, to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:016195_0003_0F9BD3E1F411E138"/>
thoſe who pleaſe him; and with as ſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of tribulation and wrath, diſtreſs and anguiſh, upon every ſoul of man that doeth evil. And who can help ſeeing, that theſe things are as neceſſary to the welfare of ſociety, as ſalt and light are for our bodies? But if ſo, why have ſuch quarrels and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſuch deceit and cruelty, been practiſed for many ages under the Chriſtian name? The anſwer in general muſt be, becauſe many miſtakes, and corrupt principles have been covered with that lovely name; of which the following are not the leaſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A conceit that religion gives the ſubjects of it, a right of dominion over the perſons and properties of others. Which is as contrary to the laws of Chriſt, as darkneſs is to light; <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 10.11—14. Luke 10.5—11. 1 Cor. 10.32; 1 Peter 2.12.</note> and is the evil that all <hi>contention</hi> comes from. Prov. 13.10. This moved ſuch as called themſelves Chriſtians in Europe, to claim the property of infidels in America; from the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof we are not yet thoroughly purged.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Inſtead of holding faſt THE FORM of ſound words, which requires our ſupreme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to God, and the loving of our neighbor as ourſelves, men have invented A FORM of godlineſs, to cover <hi>ſelf-love</hi> with; under which they have been <hi>falſe accuſers, and fierce deſpiſers of thoſe that are good.</hi> 2. Tim. 1.13 and 3.1—5. Under this maſk, one generation after another
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:016195_0004_0F9BD3E333DC61E8"/>
have caſt the reproach of their own wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon others, and have made a prey of ſuch as have departed from their evils. Iſai. 59.15. And what leſs than this, has been done to the Baptiſts, for above two hundred years? It is moſt evident that the mad actions at Munſter, in 1533, proceeded from a conceit, that the ſword was then conſecrated to the chriſtian cauſe, ſo that thoſe who had got it into their hands were to enforce their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſentiments thereby. Which conceit never was admitted by any Baptiſt church that we know of, either in Britain or America; yet the ruling parties in both countries, have held that evil faſt, while they have, not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the Baptiſts with the ſcandals it has produced, but alſo have often made a <hi>prey</hi> of them for departing therefrom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By theſe means <hi>partiality</hi> has been eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed by law, and men have been empow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to give away the money, and to judge the cauſes, of ſuch as they were <hi>intereſted</hi> againſt.</p>
            <p>Teſtimonies againſt this iniquity, have not only been given by diſſenters from the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed worſhip in this country, but alſo by ſome of the greateſt men among the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationaliſts; tho' little regard was paid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. In 1656 the town of Ipſwich impoſed a tax upon all the inhabitants, for a miniſter's ſettlement, for which diſtreſs was made.— Whereupon one of their greateſt rulers prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016195_0005_0F9BD3E3C6B90608"/>
from the firſt principles of government, that repreſentatives have no right to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any money, but only for the good of the whole community; and that the taking of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from one perſon or party, and giving it to another, was TYRANNY. <note n="*" place="bottom">Maſs. hiſtory, vol. 3. p. 291—309. Baptiſt hiſt. p. 310—312.</note> And one of their chief miniſters, who had been attached there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, till he ſaw the ſame meaſures meted to them again, by the tyrant Andros; was ſo much enlightened thereby, as to ſee, that a man has a right to all his temporal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before he becomes a Chriſtian, which he is ſo far from loſing by embracing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, becauſe he does not happen to be of the uppermoſt party, that he ſaid, "For an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt party of Chriſtians, to puniſh men in their temporal enjoyments, becauſe they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from them in ſome religious opinions, or with an excluſion from the temporal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which would juſtly belong to them, is a ROBBERY." <note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Increaſe Mathor's life, p. 59.</note> And in the year 1700, he plainly proved, that Chriſt has given the right of chuſing all church officers, to the <hi>brethren</hi> in each particular church; from whence he aſſerted that it would be SIMONICAL to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that this ſacred priviledge may be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with money. <note n="‡" place="bottom">His vindication of goſpel order, p. 67, 68.</note> And the town of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, where he was miniſter, procured a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial

act of the aſſembly, to exempt them from this ſimony, which has been impoſed upon the country ever ſince. If any enquire how ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, ſimony, and robbery came to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, and to be practiſed ſo long, under the Chriſtian name? The anſwer is plain, from the word of truth. It was by <hi>deceitful reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> from the <hi>hand-writings</hi> which Chriſt <hi>blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out,</hi> and <hi>nailed to his croſs.</hi> Col. 2.8, 14. In thoſe writings direction was given to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, to ſeize the lands and goods of heathens, to make ſlaves of them; and in other reſpects, to make a viſible diſtinction in their dealing betwixt their own brethren and all others. A high prieſt was alſo ſet up at the head of their worſhip, who, with his family, were to have the whole direction thereof; and at whoſe ſentence unclean perſons were to be excluded from their camp; unclean houſes pulled down and removed; and who had power to turn even a king out of the temple. And who can deſcribe all the ſuperſtition, blind-devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and church-tyranny, that have been bro't in by deceitful reaſonings from thence! Whereas the new teſtament plainly ſhews, that the church of Iſrael was typical of the elect among all nations. Their literal enemies types of the ſaints ſpiritual foes, and the gain they made of them, figurative of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages believers receive from tribulations and perſecutions. That their prieſthood were
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016195_0007_0F9BD3E5A0308E08"/>
types of Chriſt and his ſaints; and officers are never called prieſts in the new teſtament, in diſtinction from other believers. And in theſe and a great number of other inſtances, the comparing of type and antitype together, is very inſtructive and edifying; but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of officers, orders, and ceremonies, in the Chriſtian church, to anſwer to thoſe of the Jews; yea, and to exceed them, as the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian privileges were to be the greateſt, is the very way that myſtery Babylon was built; which myſtery is ever to be known by theſe two infallible marks.</p>
            <p n="1">1 By not holding THE HEAD, even the ONE LAWGIVER, in whom the church is COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLETE; but impoſing <hi>ordinances</hi> upon her, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>doctrines and commandments of men,</hi> which have a <hi>ſhew,</hi> but not the reallity, <hi>of wiſdom.</hi> Col. 2.10, 19—22. James 4.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2 By not allowing each believer to act <hi>as he has been taught,</hi> but others, <hi>puft up with a fleſhly mind,</hi> aſſume the power to <hi>judge</hi> for them in religious matters. Col. 2.7, 16—18.</p>
            <p>And can any religious eſtabliſhment by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man laws be found, without, at leaſt, theſe <hi>marks</hi> of the beaſt, and the <hi>number of his name,</hi> which is the <hi>number of a man.</hi> In the typical ſtate of the church, the number ſix, whether in weeks, months or years, was deſcriptive of ſeaſons of fatigue and labour, and the ſeventh
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016195_0008_0F9BD3EC1F66D950"/>
of each, were reſting times. So the beaſt can get no further than the toiling number, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in units, tens, or hundreds. But thoſe who had gotten the victory over the beaſt, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, were ſeen by John, in his viſion, ſtanding upon the ſea of glaſs, ſinging the ſong of Moſes; and of the Lamb.

               </gap>8 and 15.2, 3. Now as the pure word of God is compared to <hi>glaſs.</hi> 2 Cor. 3 18. James 1.23—25. does not this viſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the reſt and joy that believers will find, upon their getting victory over all the inventions of men, when they ſhall ſtand and act intirely upon divine truth, which is as clear as <hi>cryſtal,</hi> and enforced by divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, compared to <hi>fire?</hi> Jer. 23, 29. Rev. 4, 5, 6. And is it not ſtrictly true to ſay, that the whole of the late eccleſiaſtical laws of this province, were commandments of men, which empowered the ruling party to judge for the reſt in religious affairs, and to enforce that judgment with the ſword. There has been ſo much of real chriſtianity in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, from its firſt plantation, as greatly to check and reſtrain the poiſonous influence of this partiality; but the nature of it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the better for that. So far from it, that while ſome are trying to cover themſelves with all the good things that have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016195_0009_0F9BD3EE03E14D28"/>
us, and from thence are denying that they have oppreſſed any; others are catching at thoſe evils, to ſhield themſelves againſt the truth. Many in the State of Rhode-Iſland, bolſter themſelves up in an irreligious way, by the ſtories they have heard of the injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and cruelty which the Maſſachuſetts and Connecticuts did to their fathers, under a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious maſk; while that very irreligion is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten recurred to, as a prevailing argument for a religious partiality in theſe other States. And though we have great cauſe of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, for the light, to diſtinguiſh things more clearly, which has lately been granted, and that our honored rules have diſcovered ſo much of a regard to equal religious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet, leſt the ſame ſhould be fully allowed, I hear that ſome plead, that if rulers have no right to eſtabliſh any way of religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for its own ſake, they have a right to do it for the good of civil ſociety. The import of which plea, in my view, is juſt this viz. That becauſe religion is a means of great good to human ſociety, therefore rulers ought to improve their power to deſtroy the means, in order to accompliſh the end!</p>
            <p>For the whole of religion is to <hi>fear God, and keep</hi> HIS <hi>commandments;</hi> with a realizing view, that HE will bring <hi>every work into judgment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good or evil.</hi> And the teaching of <hi>his fear by the precepts of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016195_0010_0F9BD3EF2FF81720"/>

But it is evident, that the ſword is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the kingdom of the Redeemer, and that he gave this, as a ſufficient proof, why it did not interfere with the government of civil ſtates. John 18.36. And it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to blend church and ſtate together, without violating our Lord's commands to both.

But it has appeared for theſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, that pure goſpel diſcipline in the church, is very little, if at all known, in ſtate eſtabliſhments of religion; and that inſtead of letting conformiſts thereto, and diſſenters therefrom, grow together, or enjoy equal worldly privileges, the ſword has been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to <hi>root up,</hi> and to <hi>prepare war againſt,</hi> all ſuch as put not into the mouths of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed teachers, who are the means of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding ſuch rulers as <hi>pervert all equity.</hi> Jer. 5.31.

And it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, from the above paſſages, and many others, that the arming any to take it away with the ſword, under a religious maſk, is the greateſt engine of tyranny in the world.</p>
            <p>The celebrated Biſhop of Gloceſter wrote a volumn, about forty years ago, wholly upon this argument, that rulers ought to keep up a religious eſtabliſhment for the good of civil ſociety. He owns that the church was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally a ſociety, diſtinct from, and independent of the ſtate: But denies her being <hi>complete</hi> without an alliance therewith. Which is a plain mark of the beaſt, as I have before proved. The motives that he ſays, the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate has, for taking the church into alliance, are to preſerve the eſſence and purity of religion, to apply its influence for the good of the ſtate, and to prevent the miſchief it might otherwiſe occaſion thereto. To prove that the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate ſhould be concerned to preſerve the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of religion, he ſays, <q>Obſerving <hi>truth,</hi> is acting as things really are; he who acts as things really are muſt gain his end; all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment proceeding from acting as things really are not.</q>

he is ſo far from proving that point, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another turn of his diſcourſe, he flatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it; and, in order to prove that his ſcheme did not interfere with the right of private judgment, he poſitively aſſerts, that for rulers to eſtabliſh any religion becauſe it is the truth, is <hi>unjuſt,</hi> as they have no right to judge for others in ſuch matters; and alſo that it is <hi>abſurd,</hi> to ſuppoſe ſuch an end could be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thereby; as the eſtabliſhed religion all the world over will be the magiſtrates; that is, ſays he, <q>For one place where the <hi>true</hi> religion is eſtabliſhed, the <hi>falſe</hi> will be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed in a thouſand.</q>

voluntary ſociety. No body is born a member of any church, othewiſe the religion of parents would deſcend unto children, by the ſame right of inheritance as their temporal eſtates; and every one would hold his faith by the ſame tenure he does his lands; than which nothing can be imagined more abſurd." <note n="*" place="bottom">On toleration p. 17.</note> Yet in reality this imagination lies at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of all this controverſy. By deceitful rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings from the Jewiſh hand-writings, men have been brought to imagine themſelves to be born members of the chriſtian church, and therefore have had the token of memberſhip put upon them in their infancy; and from thence hold, that the ſame power which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends their lands, ſhould ſupport their religion. <note n="§" place="bottom">Baptiſt hiſtory, p. 483.</note> And they have no better colour for accuſing the Baptiſts of extreme rigidneſs, and of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to authority, than becauſe they cannot in conſcience give their aſſent to theſe two points. As for thoſe who ſay, That religion would ſoon fail from among us, and human learning alſo, if force was not uſed to ſupport miniſters, let them conſider, that thoſe who have a form, but deny the power of Godlineſs, are <hi>ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the</hi> TRUTH; and that they <hi>creep into houſes,</hi> inſtead of going in <hi>uprightly.</hi> 2.

upon the TRUHT; and that it prevailed gloriouſly, for three centuries, by the power of it, without the help of the ſword. And that deceit and amazing ignorance followed the introduction of the ſword to ſupport mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. And the town of Boſton have found equal religious liberty to be ſo friendly to human learning, that for theſe thirty years paſt they have been chiefly beholden for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, to diſtant colleges where ſuch liberty is enjoyed, to the neglect of the mercenary ſons of Cambridge, though within ſight of their own doors. Many of whom by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other men's works to country pariſhes, have got ſettled in the miniſtry; after which the people have been compelled to ſupport them from year to year, let them be ever ſo little edified by them. Is not this a <hi>creeping</hi> into houſes? And though ſuch are apt to turn a deaf ear to all the remonſtrances of ſcripture and reaſon, yet perhaps the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing facts may convince them, that it is out of their power to bring their old eccleſiaſtical laws into our new conſtitution of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="1">I. They have loſt much of the religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence which firſt introduced that ſcheme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this country.

ſterling a year, much of which he ſpent in promoting a religious ſettlement here; where, for all his vaſt pains and ſervices in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he had ſcarce a ſixth part of that income for his ſallery. A like religious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence appeared in many other of their rulers. And were can that party now find ſuch miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to inforce their laws as the famous Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Hooker, Norton, Mitchel, and others were? yet with all that help, their eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſo weak, when it was fifty years old, that one of their greateſt miniſters compared it to a <hi>ſmall boat,</hi> and only one Baptiſt ſociety in the colony, to the ballaſt of a <hi>great ſhip,</hi> which would ſink it. <note n="*" place="bottom">Baptiſt hiſtory p. 494, 544.</note>

            <p n="2">II. The influence of religion is now againſt them. The two capital points of purity and liberty that our fathers came to this country for, are, that none ſhould be received to full communion without a credible profeſſion of regeneration; and that a particular church thus conſtituted is the higheſt religious judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature upon earth, to whom councils are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adviſory. But thirty-nine years after Boſton was ſettled, a number of miniſters aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in forming a church there; in open <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration</hi> from the firſt church in the town, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the new invention of the half-way co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was excluded therefrom. <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 388, 405.</note> And the apoſtacy prevailed ſo faſt, for thirty years, as

to move Dr. Increaſe Mather then to declare, that if it ſhould do ſo for thirty years more, the moſt conſcientious people in New-England would think themſelves concerned to <hi>gather churches out of churches.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Vindication of goſpel order. p. 12.</note> It was then become a matter of diſpute, whether any church was intitled to the protection of the laws, if ſhe refuſed to be controuled in the choice of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, by other miniſters, and the pariſh. And forty four years after, that queſtion was deſided in the negative, when, becauſe the firſt church in Canterbury refuſed to receive the miniſter they had provided for her, a <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate</hi> church was formed in the place, <note n="†" place="bottom">A like <hi>ſeparation</hi> was made at Middleborough the ſame year.</note> and ſaid miniſter was ordained over it; and no better encouragement was given to the firſt church, by the ordaining council, than only the uſe of their influence with the legiſlature of the colony, that ſaid church <hi>might obtain all legal religious privileges</hi> whenever they deſired it. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Fiſh's examiner examined. p. 76.</note> And becauſe they did not deſire any new incorporation from the ſtate, but only protection from injuries, their goods were ſpoiled, and their perſons impriſoned, for fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years to ſupport a miniſter they never choſe, and had no more relief afforded to them, either by miniſters, or civil officers, than the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:016195_0017_0F9BD3FA8BDA4D40"/>
prieſt and levite gave to the man that fell among thieves. Conſcientious people in other places waited a year, after Canterbury church was thus ſtripped of all legal privileges, and then began to gather churches out of churches in imitation of the firſt churches of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And though their miniſters have often been reproached with the name of <hi>lay-teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> yet we can prove, that their ordinations were derived, in a direct line of ſucceſſion, from the baptiſt miniſter that Dr. Mather helped to ordain in Boſton in 1718 <note n="*" place="bottom">This is mentioned to ſilence their cavils, and not becauſe our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority depends upon a local line of ſucceſſion.</note> And now, within theſe ten years, it has plainly appeared, by their own publications, that the miniſters who are moſt earneſt to keep up their eccleſiaſtical laws, are againſt requiring a profeſſion of regeneration in order for full communion; and that they hold, that when a miniſter is ſettled in any pariſh, the court muſt compel them to ſupport him, until he, or other miniſters, conſent to his diſmiſſion, even though the church ſhould convict him of ſcandalous immoralities. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Baptiſt hiſt. p. 109, 110.

And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the many hundred inſtances of making diſtreſs for miniſters ſupport in our day, I have not heard of one, but what has cauſed ſome conviction of the impolicy, if not of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, of that practice.

Jer. 5.31. Micah 4.5—12. The Epiſcopalians covered their pleas for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing biſhops eſtabliſhed in America, with many plauſible pretences; but their wiſdom failed them. For in the midſt of thoſe pleas they have owned, that a bill for that purpoſe had almoſt got through the parliament when Queen Ann died, which was defeated thereby. And that though their party have been watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever ſince, they never could find ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother favourable opportunity, 'till now in 1767. <note n="*" place="bottom">Chandler's appeal, p, 50—54.</note> And thoſe who are verſed in the hiſtory of the nation know, that the liberties thereof were in eminent danger when the ſaid Queen died, which never were in ſo great danger ſince, till the ſcheme was invented to tax America; upon which, it ſeems, Biſhops were to have been ſent over. To prevent which Dr. Chauncy plainly denied that any ſtate had a right to make religious eſtabliſhments.

pretended right, than from all other cauſes put together; and it is with me, paſt all doubt, that it will never be reſtored to its primitive purity, ſimplicity, and glory, until religious eſtabliſhments are ſo brought down as to BE NO MORE" <note n="*" place="bottom">Chauncy's reply to Chandler's defence. 1770. p. 144, 145.</note> Theſe are the words of the miniſter, who has written the moſt, for theſe 40 years, to uphold the eſtabliſhment we complain of, of any man upon earth. And when I mentioned his firſt denial of that right laſt fall, a writer appeared in the Boſton Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette of November 2, and charged me with <hi>ignorance,</hi> for calling their eccleſiaſtical laws, an eſtabliſhment; and with <hi>impudence</hi> and <hi>abuſe,</hi> for writing againſt them. And on Dec. 28, he ſaid, "In our laws, which relate to the ſettlement and ſupport of miniſters, I am not able to find any thing that has the appearance of eſtabliſhment. All the various denominations of Proteſtants are treated <hi>alike</hi>—all Proteſtants are, therefore, in the view of our laws, <note n="‡" place="bottom">A more glaring falſhood could not be uttered than this.</note> EQUALLY orthodox." Now as our legiſlature have conſtantly called thoſe laws an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for theſe eighty-ſeven years, they are involved with me, in this charge of ignorance; and as the party they were made for, refuſed to own the truth in that reſpect, it ſeems that our honored Repreſentatives thought it high time to diſcard <hi>ſuch learning,</hi> and to appoint
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016195_0022_0F9BD402CA9E2F78"/>
a miniſter to preach to them, who was in <hi>truth</hi> a friend to the liberty others made a <hi>falſe</hi> pretence of. True wiſdom is, therefore, ſo far from favouring thoſe laws, that the <hi>folly of fools</hi> has been now made uſe of to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them. Prov. 14.8. And can they ſtand upon ſuch a bottom! Men have three things to be concerned for, namely, ſoul, body, and eſtate. The two latter belong to the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate's juriſdiction, the other does not. There is a learned profeſſion ſuited to each of theſe intereſts; yet every man and every woman have long been allowed that liberty, about phyſicians and lawyers, that has been denied them about ſoul-guides. And can my dear countrymen any longer ſuffer officers to do that out of their province, which they dare not do in it!</p>
            <p>As no man can have a right to judge for others in ſoul-affairs, ſo they never could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey ſuch a right to their repreſentatives; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all the taxes, to ſupport religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and judgements in ſuch caſes, that have been among us, were a taxing of us where we were not repreſented, and impoſing jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges upon us who were intereſted againſt us. Which meaſures God has again meted to this country in a moſt terrible manner. Self-love, under the ſpecious name of government, and a concern for the public good, has moved,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016195_0023_0F9BD403C79A4DE8"/>
and now moves, the Britons, to act towards us like incarnate devils. And ſelf-love in this country, by ſinking our public credit, has expoſed us to greater danger, than all their fleets and armies could do. The ſword, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by wiſe councels, has been the grand means of our defence againſt thoſe invaders; and infidels muſt ſee, that an inviſible power has turned the ſcale in thoſe matters, one way and the other, from time to time, entirely out of the reach of human foreſight. And how ſtrong is the argument from hence, for faithfulneſs in all rulers, to the truſt repoſed in them; and faithfulneſs in their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, to ſupport them therein? yea, and for faithfulneſs alſo in miniſters and people, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward each other, as they will anſwer therefor to the Judge of all. It was before proved, that the uſe of the ſword, againſt ſuch as work ill to their neighbours, is expreſsly warranted by the new-teſtament. And the time when it is to be laid aſide is plainly marked out in the prophecies; namely, when the <hi>knowledge of God</hi> ſhall have ſuch extenſive influence, that there ſhall be <hi>none to hurt or deſtroy,</hi> or even to <hi>make us afraid,</hi> Iſaiah 11.9. Micah 4.1—4. In the mean time, the Redeemer has exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſword from his kingdom, which he gives as the reaſon why it does not interfere with the government of <hi>worldly</hi> ſtates. John
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:016195_0024_0F9BD4041F73A2C0"/>
18.36. And how can any be true miniſters of his kingdom, who cannot be content with all the ſupport that his laws and influence will give them! Although the comfortable ſupport of religious miniſters, is moſt expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required, both in the old and new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet the uſe of force to collect it, and againſt thoſe who have teſtified againſt that practice, has produced ſuch effects in all ages, as none have been willing to own. But the Judge cannot be deceived by their deceitful coverings; and tells us all what will become of thoſe who <hi>allow</hi> of ſuch deeds, againſt plain light to the contrary. Mat. 23.29—33. Luke 11.46—52.</p>
            <p>Rulers, miniſters and people, have now a fair opportunity given them, to turn from and quit themſelves of thoſe evils; and I cannot but hope they will improve it. Eight years ago ſelf-love, under a religious pretence, had ſuch influence in our legiſlature, that we had no way left, to ſave our friends in Aſhfield from being robbed of their lands, but by an appeal to Britain. And if that evil ſhould be ingrafted into our new plan of government, we ſhould have no conſtitutional remedy againſt it left upon earth: For the Congreſs refuſe to be judges of ſuch matters. We know that Tories had then the chief ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagment of thoſe deceitful and cruel proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:016195_0025_0F9BD404C876A810"/>
againſt us; and alſo that the king and council, did not give relief in that caſe, from a regard to equal religious liberty, (which they deny at home) but for other ends. Therefore we have joined as heartily, in the general defence of our country, as any deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination therein; and I have a better opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my countrymen, than to think the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of them will now agree, to deny us liberty of conſcience.</p>
