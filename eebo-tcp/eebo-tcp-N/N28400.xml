            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER, &amp;c. TO THE CITIZENS OF PENNSYLVANIA.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Fellow citizens,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE following plan of an association, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to promote Agriculture, Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the useful Arts, has been adopted by a large number of respectable Citizens at the Seat of Government. Should it meet with your approbation; your countenance and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to establish similar Societies, within the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Counties of this Commonwealth, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly contribute to the Happiness and Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of our common Country.</p>
            <p>It is more than twenty years since Pennsyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania has taken her station among the Nations of the Earth, as a free, sovereign, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Republic. Our political existence commenced in a manner that reflected on us the greatest glory; and the first dawnings of the American Empire seemed to presage its fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture greatness. Our Country possessed every
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037840_0003_100F8437092ADCE0"/>
thing necessary to constitute a truly indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and happy People. No Country ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed these requisites in a higher degree. Such were our prospects; but we have tarnished the rising glory of our Country, and involved it in difficulties and distress. We have wantonly sported with the fair portion allotted to us by Heaven. We have departed from those plain and simple manners, and that frugal mode of living, which are absolutely necessary in the infant state of our Country, and best suited to our Republican form of Government.</p>
            <p>A vast work remains to be done, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires all the Virtues and Abilities of every individual Citizen to accomplish. The World expects measures to evince, that our contest with Great Britain was for a noble oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of promoting the general good of our Country; and not for the poor purpose of gratifying inferior designs. Guided by these laudable views, you will generously disdain any other conduct, than that of diffusing benefits to your Fellow-citizens. Your enlightened minds will readily determine, that he is an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the State, who treats his Fellow-citizens with neglect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:037840_0004_100F843AC3824CD8"/>In a State of civil Society, man must be considered as a Member of a great political Family. He is connected with his Fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, by ties of <hi>interest</hi> and <hi>benevolent attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and his social affections must extend to the whole Community of which he is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. He should feel the Safety, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Welfare, intimately connected with his own; and he should think nothing unimpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to himself, which concerns the welfare of his Country. This it is that constitutes what is called Patriotism, a principle that excites and cherishes every generous sentiment we possess. Since then, it is equally our interest as duty to promote the Welfare and Honor of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, we should make every possible exertion to establish and maintain both. The public Good and our own, are, with respect to their ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate effects, closely united; for which reason it is incumbent on us to do every thing in our power to enrich our Courtry, and to prevent its disgrace.</p>
            <p>Upon the Citizens of Pennsylvania is turned the attention of Europe, observing, whether we know how to use, as well as how to acquire, Empire; whether we are to be admired, or
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037840_0005_100F843D8C92E328"/>
despised; in fine, whether, left as we are to ourselves, upon this fair and solemn trial, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Nations of the Earth, the cause of Republican Liberty shall be justified by its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, or shall be condemned as the introducer of more Calamities than it removes. With you is the sacred Trust of realizing the Bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Freedom, and of improving, to the best advantage, the signal favors which our Country now enjoys. But, solid advantages can never be attained in a Commonweatlth, unless the Members of the Community are impressed with an affectionate regard for each other. Every individual should constantly remember that he is <hi>a Citizen;</hi> that Heaven itself has formed the Relationship, with all its obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by endowing man with Reason, and fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his nature for civil Society: That, of course, he ought to love his Companions, and be as anxious and active for their combined Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Honor, as for his own Welfare; and he should firmly believe that this is his true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, as well as his inviolable Duty.</p>
            <p>It was by thinking and acting in this manner, that the Citizens of Greece and Rome, in their better days, elevated those Republics to the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037840_0006_100F843F1EB55018"/>
eminent rank in Fame, which, even at this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant period of time, engages the universal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause of Mankind. Nor should it be forgot, that it was ceasing thus to think and act, that their degenerate Posterity resigned themselves to feuds and discords; and, with mutual ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, undermined that strength, which all their foreign Foes could not conquer. At length they sunk together into irrecoverable confusion and utter destruction. More recent, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mournful, examples of this political Truth, might be adduced.</p>
            <p>The same vices produce, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> different regions and ages, the same consequences; and the fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Divisions among Citizens, are still found to change the enraged Adversaries, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intent only on the success of their own igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quarrels, into the humble Slaves of a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
            <p>Let us not, with presumptuous rashness, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that we can imitate their Faults, without experiencing their Fate. Their Misfortunes, and the causes of them, have been providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally transmitted to us, as faithful Warnings. All the succeeding improvements of the human
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037840_0007_100F844208512E50"/>
mind, are presented to us for our use, inviting to an observance of them by the most sublime considerations. To offend against such know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, thus munificently offered to our use, is despitefully to reprobate the best Gifts of the bountiful Creator, and impiously to renounce that kind and social temper, which his immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Law makes the foundation of all private Happiness. May the People of Pennsylvania be governed by better Principles, so that, whilst every Citizen is stedfastly seeking to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the best interests of his Country, the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected force of the whole may be uniformly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted to supply that common fund of Prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, from which every individual must draw his share. May no contention remain among us, but who shall best serve his Country.</p>
            <p>Let Pennsylvania not only exhibit flourishing Inclosures and Harvests, but the comfortable Houses of industrious Artists and Manufactur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. It is impossible to contemplate the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress which we have already made, without inspiring a desire to progress in every useful Occupation. The certainty of its being possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, affords sufficient encouragement to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere with Ardor and Enthusiasm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:037840_0008_100F8445FA4DD3B8"/>In an age, also, when Philosophical Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have universally pervaded the civilized World, and when human researches have been directed to the attainment of useful knowledge; the Arts and Sciences have arrived to a degree of improvement, that justly distinguishes the present Century, as the aera of refined Genius and Learning; Objects of Science are, however, continually acquiring new Lights, and the Arts are still advancing towards he highest perfection, of which they are susceptible; Perseverance in the investigation of the nature, properties, and the uses of things must necessarily lead to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attainments in useful knowledge.</p>
            <p>For your encouragement in this patriotic un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, it may be observed, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the establishments which have taken place in the World, calculated to promote the useful Arts, have been brought about by the exertions of private Citizens: Yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing a degree of presumptuous confidence, which always accompanies grand and useful undertakings; we must not disguise the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition and Difficulties you will meet with, from interested Foreigners, who have been too long in the habit of furnishing our Country with
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037840_0009_100F8448A272E0D0"/>
those articles, which we now desire to have supplied by the Ingenuity and Industry of our own Citizens. It is high time, that the influx of foreign Manufactures and the adoption of foreign Fashions, should not destroy our National Character, or impede our progress to a situation <hi>truly independent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Proud of the Advantages which our own Country will afford, and which our own La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour will procure; let us disdain to be the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Imitators of other Nations, or to adopt foreign manners inconsistent with our Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can form of Government. The smallness of your numbers, in any particular District, should not discourage you from establishing patriotic Societies: In small Societies, men are encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged to communicate their sentiments freely; and there is scarcely any man whose Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations will not, on some occasions, be of use. Nor should slight difficulties in the undertaking be any obstacle to your perseverance. Make but a sincere beginning, and the immediate Advantages, that will result from your Associ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ations, will stimulate to a laudable persever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:037840_0010_100F844A348A12C0"/>The breast of every Republican Citizen will glow with the importance of the cause in which he is engaged. No man deserves Confidence, who is shaken by every wind, or who can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure no Adversities in the cause in which he may be engaged.</p>

               <p>INDEPENDENT Communities do not owe their Characters to the Soil which they occupy; but to their Progress in the useful Arts. To those Causes are to be attributed, not only the difference in the Characters and the Manners of Nations, but their Prosperity, Strength, and Happiness. On this account, Political Justice requires, that every Individual, in becoming a Member of a particular Society, should adopt a mode of conduct consistent with his relative situation to such Society. Men would never have associated together, if they
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037840_0012_100F845144870EC0"/>
had not expected, that, in consequence of such Association, they would mutually conduce to the Advantage and Happiness of each other. This is the <hi>real Purpose,</hi> the <hi>genuine Foundation</hi> of civil Society; and, as far as this Purpose is answered, so far does civil Society answer the end of its institution.</p>
               <p>Upon the Emancipation of our Country from the Political Yoke of Great Britain, we deemed and called ourselves a free and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Commonwealth: But there are means of inferior and indirect Subjugation, from which our Country is not yet emancipated.</p>
               <p>The Citizens of Pennsylvania are yet behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the British, for the determinations of her Courts, for her Maxims of Commercial Policy, and for many Political Prejudices.</p>
               <p>We are dependent on Great Britain for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every Article of Clothing we wear, for a great part of the Furniture of our Houses, for the Instruments of our amusements, and for the means of our Defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:037840_0013_100F845413BFDCC8"/>Nor is it only for Articles of immediate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from that Country, that we are dependent on Great Britain. The dangerous preeminence of her Navy: A Navy that Domineers, with impunity, on the Ocean; that incessantly threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the Peace of the Earth; that carries the devastations of War, upon every pretended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult, from the Shores of that Island, to the remotest parts of the Globe; that imperiously forces every Maritime Country to take part in, or suffer by her quarrels; and prohibits, at pleasure, the Commercial Intercourse of the World. From the dangerous preeminence of this Navy we, also, are perpetually liable to be interdicted from those Articles of Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Expedience or Necessity have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced us to seek for from other Countries: And yet our Clothing, imported from Great Britain, is made tributary to support this very Navy; which is daily committing the most wanton Depredations on our Commerce. Nor is it an Evil of trifling magnitude, that the Credit, almost forced upon our Merchants by the cupidity of the British Traders, has overwhelmed our Country with British Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, far beyond the real Wants of the Consumer. It has excited our Farmers to need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037840_0014_100F8455A2EF4878"/>
Expense, and involved them in Difficulties, for Articles of mere Luxury: It has rendered the plain, but comfortable, Manufactures, which employed the leisure hours of their Wives and Daughters, disreputable, because unfashionable. It has made the Farmer tributary to the Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper; the Storekeeper, to the Merchant of Philadelphia; the Merchant of Philadelphia, to the Merchant of Great Britain. The Credit thus given, can, at any time, be withdrawn; the Debts thus contracted, can, at any time, be demanded; and the Peace and Comfort of a numerous Body of American Citizens are now, and have long been, at the Mercy of British Merchants, and of the British Court. Hence are our Commercial Towns filled with British Subjects, who conduct our Trade; with British Agents, who drain our Wealth; with British Politics, British Interests, and British Influence. To lessen, in part, these enormous Evils; to render our Citizens, in their private as well as in their public Capacities, really as they ought to be, <hi>independent of Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> for Articles which the Necessities, or the Comforts, of Life require; and to suppress the Temptations to improvident Expense; <hi>We propose</hi> a general encouragement to Agriculture,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037840_0015_100F8458568EBC08"/>
Manufactures, and the useful Arts. An en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement that shall make <hi>the use of</hi> our own Productions and Manufactures the fashionable Articles of Consumption; at least in every Circle of <hi>American Republicans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not that it is our Desire to make this, in the common acceptation of the Word, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturing Country: Nor do we contemplate any Manufactured Article for an export Trade; nor any Manufacture among ourselves, which the natural Resources of our Country may not make profitable.</p>
               <p>Still less are we desirous of introducing in this happy Country, that baneful system of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean Management which dooms the human Faculties to be smothered, and Man to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a Machine. We want not that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling plan of Manufacturing Policy, which has debilitated the Bodies, and debased the Minds, of so large a Class of People as the Manufacturers of Europe.</p>
               <p>Nor are we ambitious to see a Manufacturing Capitalist, as in the great Manufacturing Towns of Europe, enjoy his Luxuries, or fill his Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037840_0016_100F845C877A2B58"/>
by paring down the hard-earned Wages of the laborious Artists he employs.</p>
               <p>But the Object of our Association is, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, from the fertile Soil of Pennsyvania, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Production it is capable of affording; and, from the Labour and ingenuity of independent Citizens, every Article of Manufacture and of the useful Arts, necessary to render our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try happy, prosperous, and truly independent.</p>
