            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT ſeems to be a kind of duty incumbent on thoſe who devote themſelves to Poetry, to raiſe, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the dignity of a declining Art, by making it as beneficial to Life and Manners as the limits of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and the character of modern Times will allow: The ages, indeed, are paſt, in which the ſong of the Poet was idolized for its MIRACULOUS EFFECTS; yet a Poem, intended to promote the cultivation of good-humour, may ſtill, perhaps, be fortunate enough to prove of ſome little ſervice to ſociety in general; or, if this idea may be thought too chimerical and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic by ſober Reaſon, it is at leaſt one of thoſe pleaſing and innocent deluſions, in which a political Enthuſiaſt may be ſafely indulged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:020410_0003_0FAF08FBF3502B60"/>THE following production owes its exiſtence to an incident in real life, very ſimilar to the principal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the laſt Canto; but in forming the general plan of the work, it ſeemed to me abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to introduce both the agency and the abode of SPLEEN, notwithſtanding the difficulty and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of attempting a ſubject ſo happily executed by the maſterly pencil of Pope. I conſidered his Cave of Spleen as a moſt exquiſite cabinet picture; and, to avoid the ſervility of imitation, I determined to ſketch the manſion of this gloomy Power on a much wider canvaſs: Happy, indeed, if the judgment of the public may enable me to exclaim, with the honeſt vanity of the Painter, who compared his own works to the divine productions of Raphael,
<q>E ſon Pittore anch' Io!</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE celebrated Aleſſandro Taſſoni, who is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conſidered as the inventor of the modern Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comic Poetry, was ſo proud of having extended the limits of his art by a new kind of compoſition, that he not only ſpoke of it with infinite exultation in one of his private letters, but even gave a MS copy of his work to his native city of Modena, with an inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which he ſtyled it a new ſpecies of Poetry, invented by himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:020410_0004_0FAF08FE42A523A8"/>A FEW partial friends have aſſerted, that the preſent performance has ſome degree of ſimilar merit; but as I apprehend all the novelty it poſſeſſes, may rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an apology, than entitle its Author to challenge commendation, I ſhall explain how far the conduct of the Poem differs from the moſt approved models in this mode of writing, and ſlightly mention the poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal effects, which ſuch a variation appeared likely to produce.</p>
            <p>IT is well known, that the favorite Poems, which blend the ſerious and the comic, repreſent their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal characters in a ſatirical point of view: It was the intention of Taſſoni (though prudence made him attempt to conceal it) to ſatirize a particular Italian Nobleman, who happened to be the object of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment. Boileau openly ridicules the French Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtics in his Lutrin; Garth, our Engliſh Phyſicians, in his Diſpenſary; and the Rape of the Lock itſelf, that moſt excellent and enchanting Poem, which I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver contemplate but with new idolatry, is denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated THE BEST SATIRE EXTANT, by the learned Dr. Warton, in his very elegant and ingenious, but ſevere Eſſay on Pope: A ſentence which ſeems to be confirmed by the Poet himſelf, in his letter to Mrs. Fermor, where he ſays, <q>The character of Belinda,
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:020410_0005_0FAF08FF49D5FD78"/>
as it is now managed, reſembles you in nothing but beauty.</q> Though I think, that no compoſition can ſurpaſs, or perhaps ever equal this moſt happy effort of Genius, as a ſportive Satire, I imagined it might be poſſible to give a new Character to this mixed ſpecies of Poetry, and to render it by its Object, though not in its Execution, more noble than the moſt beautiful and refined Satire can be. We have ſeen it carried to inimitable perfection, in the moſt delicate raillery on Female Foibles:—It remained to be tried, if it might not alſo aſpire to delineate the more engaging features of Female Excellence. The idea appeared to me worth the experiment; for, if it ſucceeded, it ſeemed to promiſe a double advantage; firſt, it would give an air of novelty to the Poem; and, ſecondly, what I thought of much greater importance, it would render it more intereſting to the heart. On theſe principles, I have endeavored to paint SERENA as a moſt lovely, engaging, and accompliſhed character; yet I hope the colouring is ſo faithfully copied from GENERAL NATURE, that, every man, who reads the Poem, may be happy enough to know many Fair ones, who reſemble my Heroine.</p>
            <p>THERE is another point, in which I have alſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to give this Poem an air of novelty: I mean, the manner of connecting the real and the viſionary
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:020410_0006_0FAF08FFAFDBB580"/>
ſcenes, which compoſe it; by ſhifting theſe in alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Cantos, I hoped to make familiar Incident and allegorical Picture afford a ſtrong relief to each other, and keep the attention of the Reader alive, by an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance particularly diverſified. I wiſhed, indeed (but I fear moſt ineffectually) for powers to unite ſome touches of the ſportive wildneſs of Arioſto, and the more ſerious ſublime painting of Dante, with ſome portion of the enchanting elegance, the refined imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and the moral graces of Pope; and to do this, if poſſible, without violating thoſe rules of propriety, which Mr. Cambridge has illuſtrated, by example as well as precept, in the Scribleriad, and in his ſenſible Preface to that elegant and learned Poem.</p>
            <p>I HAVE now very frankly informed my Reader of the EXTENT, or rather of the EXTRAVAGANCE of my deſire; for I will not give it the name of DESIGN:— They, whom an enlightened taſte has rendered tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly ſenſible how very difficult it muſt be to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh ſuch an idea, will not only be the firſt to diſcern, but the moſt ready to pardon thoſe errors, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which ſo hazardous an attempt may perhaps have betrayed me. I had thoughts of introducing this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance to the Public, by a Diſſertation of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble length on this ſpecies of Poetry; but I forbear to indulge myſelf any farther in ſuch preliminary remarks,
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:020410_0007_0FAF09007A795088"/>
as the anxiety of authors is ſo apt to produce, from the reflection, that, however ingeniouſly written, they add little or nothing to the ſucceſs of a good Poem and are utterly inſufficient to prevent that neglect, or oblivion, which is the inevitable fate of a bad one.</p>
            <p>IN diſmiſſing a work to my Fair Readers, which is intended principally for their peruſal, I ſhall only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to their attention; and bid them farewell, in the words of the pleaſant and courteous Taſſoni—
