            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <bibl>
                     <hi>EPHESIANS II. 8.</hi>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the preceding Chapter the Apoſtle endeavours by various Arguments, to Confirm the Epheſians in the Belief of this great Truth, That Divine Grace alone Challenges the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003123_0004_0FF0029DF16E8E68"/>
Glory of the Salvation of Sinners. In this, he Amplifies the Riches of it, from the Conſideration of the ſtate ſuch are in, before they are Quickned with Chriſt: And this he tells them in the firſt Verſe, <hi>is a ſtate of Death; Ye were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins</hi>: Not only Judicially dead, becauſe obnoxious to Death, but really Spiritually dead, alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in their Hearts from GOD; which is properly Spiritual Death. This their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Death, he proves from the Effects or Fruits of it; when he tells them their Life had been in Sin, a Walk, or Courſe in Tranſgreſſion, reliſhing only what was Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, under the Influence and Dominion of Satan; who before their Converſion had ruled in them, as he always does in the Children of Diſobedience, in the ſecond Verſe. And to ſhew them that Divine Grace was as Conſpicuous in the Salvation of others, as of them, he obſerves that ſuch a condition as he had been deſcribing, was not peculiar to the Epheſians, but common to all, till Renewed by the Spirit of CHRIST even including himſelf, (who elſewhere ſpeaks of himſelf as being Blameleſs, as to the External Righteouſneſs of the Law) in the third Verſe; Among which <hi>Sons of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,</hi> ſaith he, in whom Sin Reigns and over whom Satan Lords it, <hi>we all had in Time
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003123_0004_0FF0029DF16E8E68"/>
paſt, our Converſation alſo, in the Luſts of our Fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the Fleſh and of the Mind; and more by Nature the Children of Wrath, even as others.</hi> No one by Nature, having in this reſpect any Excellency above another. To be delivered from ſuch a Miſerable State as this, To have a Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Life Communicated from CHRIST, and made to grow up in Him to the fulneſs of the Stature of a Perfect man, &amp; to be raiſed up together and made to ſit together in Heavenly Places in CHRIST JESUS; which tho' not ſeen with our eyes, but is hid in the Chriſtian's Hope, and of which he may be ſaid to have already Poſſeſſion <hi>in CHRIST.</hi> This as is obſerved in the Context muſt needs carry their thoughts, to a Mercy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in its Riches, and to an Infinite A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhingly free Love as the ſpring of it; and to make the Concluſion with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in the Text, That Grace alone may Glory in their Salvation. <hi>For by Grace are ye Saved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>WHERE may be obſerved;</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>THE true Cauſe of our Salvation aſſerted; By Grace are ye Saved. Grace</hi> is ſometimes uſed for the <hi>Free Favour of GOD</hi>; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the <hi>Effects of that Favour</hi> in us
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003123_0005_0FF002972F315C20"/>
But it is <hi>here uſed</hi> in its Primary acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the <hi>Free Favour,</hi> Love, or Good will <hi>of GOD,</hi> as the Fountain whence all Gifts flow to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SALVATION,</hi> may be Conſidered either as <hi>Begun,</hi> or <hi>Compleat</hi>; both which are Included in his aſſertion, as the Context abundantly proves. <hi>From Grace it is begun</hi> and <hi>compleated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Secondly,</p>
            <p n="2">2. A falſely ſuppoſed cauſe of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Rejected. Our ſelves.</hi> A Diſpoſition to advance Self in oppoſition to Grace, in its method of ſaving Sinners, is deeply rooted in us; every one naturally ſets up a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of his own, ſomething he imagines he finds in himſelf, or ſomething he has done as a ground of his acceptance, or at leaſt as what moves the exerciſe of Divine Compaſſion towards him, This the Apoſtle entirely Rejects, <hi>Not of your ſelves.</hi> It is not for any thing in us that Salvation is beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or for <hi>any works</hi> we do, which he adds to confirm this Truth, and ſubjoins the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe works as they ſtand not with Grace, ſo they are Enemies to the Glory of it, inaſmuch as they ſet up Glory in our ſelves, <hi>Leſt any man ſhould Boaſt.</hi> So that nothing is to be attributed to Self, as Cauſal
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003123_0005_0FF002972F315C20"/>
of this Salvation; No, for although it be <hi>through Faith,</hi> yet we can't challenge any thing; for Faith Renounces all Works, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, &amp; Worthineſs of our own, and brings us empty to GOD, receiving CHRIST for Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption. Nor is it from any ſtrength in us by which we do this, but the LORD gives this; and therefore the Apoſtle adds, <hi>It is the Gift of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence the DOCTRINE is,</p>
            <p>THE Salvation of Sinners, is, in every part of it from the Grace of GOD.</p>
            <p>ALL the Good that ever the fallen Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can have, muſt iſſue out of GOD's free Love; which is a motive to it ſelf for the doing good to the Sinful and Miſerable Creature. GOD is Kind and Merciful to it becauſe he will be ſo. He acts moſt freely herein, and the reaſon of it is not to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for out of Himſelf.</p>
            <p>IN handling of the Doctrine, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour briefly to Evince the following Propoſition.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>IT is from Grace, That CHRIST was given to be a Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:003123_0006_0FF002ACA2EE46A8"/>II. <hi>IT is from Grace, That this SAVIOUR is made Known to any.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>IT is from Grace, That any are Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prevailed upon to Believe in Him, or to accept of Salvation by Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>IT is from Grace, that ſuch as do Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Him, are made to Perſevere in Faith &amp; Holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>THAT their Salvation is Conſummated in GLORY, is alſo from Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>IT is from Grace that CHRIST was given to be a Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MAN was Capacitated and deſigned for a glorious Service, the Knowing, Loving and glorifying his MAKER, and by an abundant Goodneſs was encouraged thereto; Yet did act ſo Unworthily towards Him in violating his Laws, diſowning his Authority over him and renouncing his Dependence upon Him and Obligations to him, That when it is ſeriouſly Thought of, we may juſtly be filled with Wonder that Vengeance did not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue him with Everlaſting Puniſhments. It muſt force a Conviction in us, that he is deſtitute of a Plea for favour from a Juſtly Incenſed DEITY, and that no Injury is
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003123_0006_0FF002ACA2EE46A8"/>
done him if he is everlaſtingly left under His Frowns. Relief can ariſe to him from no Spring but the meer Mercy of GOD; From That &amp; no other Fountain, could the amazing Gift of a SAVIOUR flow. Had the good Will, the Grace of GOD ſuſpended its act of giving the SAVIOUR, all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind would have been left in a ſtate of Sin, and Wrath; and that act might have been ſuſpended, might not have been, if it had ſeemed good to the Moſt High ſo to have Determined. If that act could not have been ſuſpended, it was then a matter of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, what muſt, and could not but have been Antecedent to any act of GOD's Will about it. Which will ſuppoſe, Abſolute Freedom, ſubject to Conſtraint that indeed there is no ſuch thing in GOD as Abſolute Freedom. And as there was no neceſſity from the nature of the thing, ſo there was no neceſſity lying upon GOD with relation to his own Perfections, to give his SON as a SAVIOUR to the World. Not on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Glorifying Himſelf this way by the diſcovery of His Mercy. 'Tis certain He always acts for his own Glory, becauſe there is none greater than Himſelf. But that he ſhould Glorify Himſelf by the diſcovery of His Mercy, in providing a SAVIOUR for Sinners, He could not be Neceſſitated to,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003123_0007_0FF002BC16BA40A8"/>
ſince if he had ſeen fit he might have glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his Juſtice &amp; Power in their Deſtruction. There could be no Neceſſity upon GOD in point of Juſtice to do it, for Man by breaking the Law, righteouſly deſerved Death. So that Man would have had no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done him by GOD, if that Sentence had been Executed upon him, Nor could there be any Neceſſity from the Infinite Mercy &amp; Compaſſion of GOD. GOD has; Mercy large enough to Relieve all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that may be in Miſery, but there is no neceſſity in the nature of Infinite Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Relieve them: If there were, it muſt extend it ſelf in a like manner to all in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and ſo it were Impoſſible that any of his Creatures ſhould render themſelves final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miſerable, by any Sin. The Contrary whereof we are aſſured. The exerciſe of his Mercy is under the Command of his Will, and why it is exerciſed towards one in Miſery and not towards another, is only becauſe it is His Pleaſure: So that this Act of giving his Son to be the Saviour of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, might not have been, if it had ſeemed good to him not to have done it; and ſo all Mankind had Eternally and Juſtly Periſhed. From no other Fountain therefore but Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Grace, does flow this glorious Gift of a Saviour. This Gift was made to a Sinful
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003123_0007_0FF002BC16BA40A8"/>
World becauſe it pleaſed GOD ſo to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his Love 1 Joh. 4 9. <hi>In this was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted the Love of GOD towards us, becauſe that GOD ſent his only Begotten Son into the World, that we might Live through him.</hi> Joh. 3 16. <hi>GOD ſo Loved the World, that he gave his only Begotten Son, that whoſoever Believeth in him, might not Periſh, but have Everlaſting Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>IT is from Grace, that a SAVIOUR, &amp; a way of Salvation by Him, a made Known to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Goſpel is not a Debt to any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for as GOD owes no Mercy to any Sinner, Not the giving of a SAVIOUR, So not the Revealing of Him to any People; All are equally unworthy by Nature of ſuch a Benefit; being equally Sinners, they are equally Children of Wrath. Not any one more than another deſerves it, nor any one at all; therefore that any one has it, is an act of meer Grace. That one Man or one Nation is paſſed by and ſuffered to dwell in Ignorance, and another enjoys the Goſpel-Light, is from the good Pleaſure of the Divine Will. Why was it that GOD paſſed by the reſt of the Nations of the World, and choſe ISRAEL to be a peculiar People to Himſelf? Not becauſe they had more to commend them than any other Nation; but
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003123_0008_0FF002B4B6F80968"/>
becauſe it pleaſed GOD to ſeparate them from others; who being equally LORD of all, might ſingle out whom He would to be the Subjects of his Favour; might overlook o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Chooſe them: or have paſſed by them, and Selected others. His taking them to be a peculiar Treaſure to himſelf above all People, He aſſerts himſelf to be an Act of his Sovereignty, and the Reaſon of ſuch a Diſpenſation to be reſolved into that; <hi>For all the Earth is mine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5. <hi>So Deut.</hi> 10.14, 15. <hi>Behold the Heaven and the Heaven of Heavens is the LORD's thy GOD, the Earth alſo with all that therein is. Only the LORD had a Delight in thy Fathers, to love them and he choſe their Seed after them, even you above all People, as it is this Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND it is evident there was nothing in them as the Ground of it, from their Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Rebellious Carriage under all the Kindneſs and Mercy ſhewed them. This GOD foreſaw, and told them before hand, they would be Rebellious from their youth; to prevent their entertaining ſuch an Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. Iſa 48.4 — 8 <hi>Becauſe I knew that thou art Obſtinate, and thy Neck is an Iron Sinew, and thy Brow Braſs' — I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; —
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003123_0008_0FF002B4B6F80968"/>
For I knew thou wouldeſt deal very Treacherouſly, &amp; waſt called a Tranſgreſſor from the womb.</hi> All appearance of Merit in them of ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing Favour, muſt be utterly diſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; the Reſolution of it muſt be into the free Favour of GOD. He loved them becauſe he loved them. This is the Reaſon he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Aſſigns, Deut. 7.7, 8. <hi>The Lord did not ſet his love upon you, nor chooſe you, becauſe ye were more in Number than any People, (for ye were the feweſt of all People) but becauſe the Lord Loved you.</hi> And ſince the Jews for their Unbelief have been diſown'd of GOD for a People, the Gentiles have been called in. But why, ſince they were covered with groſs Idolatry? This was the good Pleaſure of his Will, to call in, and reveal a way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to thoſe that ſought not after it. Rom. 10.20. <hi>I was found of them that ſought me not; I was made manifeſt to them that asked not after me.</hi> And in the Context the ſame Apoſtle ſhews that the exceeding Riches of GOD's Grace is manifeſt in calling ſuch in, that were far off, Strangers from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Promiſe, and having no hope and without GOD in the World; In the 7<hi>th.</hi> 12<hi>th</hi> and 13<hi>th ver.</hi> And why any Nations now lye in groſs Darkneſs and Idolatry, and we enjoy the Goſpel Revelation, is not ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any Motive, rather to be found in us
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003123_0009_0FF002B29DB34D50"/>
than in them. Our being called and not they, is to be reſolved into the Gracious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of GOD. 2 <hi>Tim,</hi> 1.9.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>IT is from Grace, that any are Effectually prevailed upon to Believe in CHRIST, or to accept of Salvation by Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE great Gift of the SAVIOUR was perfectly free. The External diſcovery of him to any, is perfectly free. So alſo is the overcoming any to whom the Goſpel is ſent, to receive this SAVIOUR from the free Grace of GOD.</p>
            <p>IN this Particular Three things are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and may be diſtinctly Spoken to.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A Saving Faith in CHRIST is not the Product of Mans natural Powers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>THIS is wrought in the Soul by a Divine Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>THIS is done Freely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A Saving Faith in CHRIST is not the Product of Mans Natural Powers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MAN in his natural Condition has not a Power ſufficient to Produce in himſelf a

Saving Faith in CHRIST; ſo that it can never be from himſelf that he has Saving benefit by him, though He be ſet forth as a SAVIOUR before him in the Goſpel. For, although his underſtanding, may have ſuch a conviction of that great Truth, That JESUS CHRIST was <hi>the Sent of GOD to take away the Sin of the World</hi>; and that the way of Salvation revealed in the Goſpel, is every way becoming the Glorious Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Great Author of it, as that he can't deny his aſſent thereto; and this be alſo as much within the Compaſs of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Powers, as to underſtand any Truth in Nature that may be propoſed to him. Yet ſuch <hi>a ſight of the Glory of GOD, in the Goſpel in the Face of his Son, as makes the Soul to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Goſpel on a Divine account, to take CHRIST for Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Redemption, and Transforms it into the Divine likeneſs, renews us in the Spirit of our mind,</hi> and makes us <hi>to put off the Old Man,</hi> As the Apoſtle deſcribes Regeneration and the fruits of it, in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22, 23, 24. This is not from the ſtrength of his own reaſoning Powers. The ſuppoſal of a <hi>ſufficiency of Strength in mens Powers to raiſe the Soul to this heigth, ſeems Inconſiſtent with the deſign of the Goſpel,</hi> which is to exalt Grace and abaſe the Sinner, ſtrip him of every thing whereof to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003123_0010_0FF002BE62966690"/>
Glory, to level every high Thought and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination with the Duſt, and as it were to Nullify Self. To this Truth alſo <hi>Experience gives in its Evidence</hi>: When the Soul faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looks into, and views it ſelf, what will it find but the Image of Satan upon it, in its Unregenerate ſtate? a very Hell of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs in it ſelf, full of deep &amp; unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Deceit, and Wickedneſs, full of Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, Infidelity and Diſability to Good; &amp; hearkens not, nor will be ſubject to the Law of GOD. But <hi>is full of Enmity thereto,</hi> as <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this <hi>Spiritual Death</hi> of the Soul, its Inherent and Univerſal Pravity, ſuch are eſpecially <hi>ſenſible</hi> and <hi>diſtinctly Convinced of,</hi> to whom the <hi>Commandment has come with Power,</hi> As the Apoſtle ſpeaks <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. And whoſe underſtandings are opened to conceive the Spirituality, Penetration, and Compaſs of the Holy Law, which meaſureth the frame, and every motion of the Soul. They abhor themſelves, and adore the Mercy that will ſave; and the Power that quickens them with a Divine Life.</p>
            <p>AND this Truth is abundantly <hi>Confirmed by the Scriptures,</hi> in the account it gives us of Man in his Lapſed ſtate, Rom. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9,—18. <hi>Both Jews and Gentiles, They are all under Sin. There is none that Underſtandeth or ſeeketh after
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003123_0010_0FF002BE62966690"/>
GOD. None that doth good, no not one,</hi> &amp;c <hi>All are Conceived in Sin, and ſhapen in Iniquity.</hi> Pſal. 51.5. <hi>And go aſtray from the Womb,</hi> Pſal. 58.3. <hi>Every Imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart is only evil continually. Gen.</hi> 6.5. Every Action of the mind, is <hi>only Evil,</hi> not one of its Motions being Pure, for it <hi>is every Imagination of the Thoughts,</hi> that is ſaid to <hi>be only Evil</hi>; and at no time otherwiſe, for it is <hi>Continual,</hi> not a Habit contracted by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated acts, but <hi>is ſo from his Youth,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21. Every act being Evil, proves the Frame and Temper of the Soul to be ſo, whence the Actions ſpring, otherwiſe every motion would not be irregular; whence it ſeems no way poſſible, that his recovery from ſuch a ſtate, ſhould ſpring from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: that ſuch a Soul ſo depraved can any more Determine it ſelf to Holineſs, than an <hi>evil Tres, bring forth good Fruit; or a bitter Fountain ſend forth ſweet waters, Mat.</hi> 7 18. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.11, 12. Thus the Apoſtle ſays Expreſly, 1 Cor. 2.14. <hi>That the Natural man Receiveth not the things of the Spirit of GOD: for they are Fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, for they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> Where he ſeems manifeſtly to Denominate Men from their better part, and to intend, not thoſe that would drown their Reaſon with their Luſts, but ſuch rather as improve their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003123_0011_0FF002B007304560"/>
Powers in all Kinds of Learning; Whom he juſt before calls <hi>Wiſe Men, Scribes</hi> and <hi>Diſputers,</hi> That he might exclude every thing of natural or acquired Perfection; by which Humane Reaſon, by its own Strength, might arrive at this ſpiritual diſcerning of Divine Things; &amp; Such ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Reject the things of the Spirit of GOD;</hi> becauſe <hi>they ſeem Fooliſhneſs to them, nor can they know them,</hi> he Adds; which denotes not the fault of their Sloth, and Negligence, as Though they might underſtand them, if they would exerciſe the Powers of their own Reaſon; but the Impotence it ſelf, their Powers La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under, to underſtand them.</p>
            <p>AND as they thus ſpeak of the Natural Man, ſo they aſcribe his Renovation to the Spirit of GOD, which is a full proof of this Truth of mans ſpiritual Impotency, Which brings us to the Second thing. Namely,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>THIS is wrought in the Soul by a Divine Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Truth is aſſerted here in the Text, that <hi>Faith is the Gift of GOD.</hi> Not of our ſelves is our Salvation, nor our Faith, but as the Salvation, ſo alſo the Faith (which is indeed a part of our Salvation) is the free Gift of GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'Tis not ſaid a Power only
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003123_0011_0FF002B007304560"/>
to believe, it is the Faith, the Believing it ſelf that he is ſaid to give. Man has not Faith before GOD gives it, otherwiſe it would not be GOD's Gift. If GOD gives it, then there is a Reception of it, <hi>i. e.</hi> The Soul is cauſed by GOD to believe; for Giving and Receiving relate to, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſuppoſe each other.</p>
            <p>SO alſo in Phil. 2 13. <hi>For it is GOD which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good Pleaſure.</hi> This ſpeaks not of a Power meerly to do, but of <hi>an actual willing</hi> wrought by GOD. For it is ſaid, <hi>GOD works in us to will</hi> and <hi>to do.</hi> If GOD <hi>works the willing</hi>; then it is not we work it. Nor have we it, till he works it. The kind of working here aſcribed to GOD, is ſuch as actually produces the Effect of willing; not ſuch a one as brings the Soul only into a kind of Indifferency or aequilibrio; that it may will, or not will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For GOD can't be ſaid to work Efficaciouſly, or to Effect (as <hi>Energone,</hi> the Word there uſed, ſignifies) the willing in us; unleſs the willing be Effected by him. Such an <hi>Exertion</hi> of the <hi>Divine Power upon the Soul,</hi> is <hi>here plainly aſſerted</hi> as <hi>Cauſes it to will; willing</hi> is certainly and neceſſarily ſuppoſed to follow; elſe nothing is wrought, and that ſomething ſhould be wrought, and yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003123_0012_0FF002C27A5643E0"/>
done, is a Contradiction. Nor does this offer Violence to the Soul, as being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with its proper freedom, that GOD ſhould ſo exert his Power upon it, as that its believing, or willing, ſhould neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow upon it. Since Freedom of will in the Rational Creature, conſiſts in a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of determining it ſelf according to its own Perceptions. It follows that if it be made to apprehend juſtly of its chief good, (of GOD as ſuch) it muſt chooſe it, and reſt in it, with the greateſt freedom and yet greateſt neceſſity. To ſuppoſe it Poſſible for it to remain in aequilibrio, or to reject it, is to deſtroy that very Power which is freedom it ſelf. A Power to Determine Contrary to its own Perceptions, (as this would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) Infallibly deſtroys the eſſential Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Souls Operation.</p>
            <p>NOR will this Efficacious exerting of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power upon the Soul, any ways ſuppoſe that the actual willing, or believing is not Man's, for the <hi>willing</hi> is aſcribed to Man in the Text, and the <hi>Cauſing of him to will,</hi> at the ſame time, is aſcribed to GOD.</p>
            <p>OUR SAVIOUR's words to Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, are alſo Expreſs in this caſe, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3—8. Where as our SAVIOUR informs
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003123_0012_0FF002C27A5643E0"/>
him, of the Outward way of admiſſion into His Viſible Kingdom under a Goſpel Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, was to be by Baptiſm, <hi>being born of Water</hi>; ſo He lets him know that more than this, <hi>Even his being born again of the Spirit,</hi> was neceſſary in order to his being a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of His Inviſible Kingdom; where CHRIST Reigns in the Hearts of men by His Grace, which in the moſt appropriate ſenſe is His Kingdom. <hi>Except a man be born of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of GOD. That which is born of the Fleſh, is Fleſh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit. The wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof,</hi> but canſt <hi>not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth; ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit.</hi> In the laſt Verſe, our SAVIOUR confirms the Truth of the Doctrine of the New Birth, or Spiritual Change of the Soul, about which <hi>Nicodemus</hi> haeſitateth, and expreſly aſſerts it to be an Effect of the Sovereign Agency of the SPIRIT; as much as Sound is an Effect of the Winds blowing. And as our Ignorance of the manner of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of this ſenſible Effect, is not made uſe of by us as an Argument againſt either the Thing it ſelf, or its Cauſe; ſo neither may our Ignorance of the manner of the Spirit's Operation, be improved by us as an
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003123_0013_0FF002C46DA739B0"/>
Argument againſt the truth of ſuch an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or the SPIRIT's being the Cauſe of it. <hi>The Wind bloweth where it liſteth,</hi> &amp; <hi>men hear the Sound of it,</hi> &amp; thereby know ſuch a Thing is in motion; though they know not how it moves or what becomes of it. <hi>So is every one that is Born of the Spirit,</hi> i. e. The SPIRIT worketh this Product of the New Birth in whom ſoever and when ſoever it pleaſeth Him; and he in whom it is wrought, finds by the Change and Effects in himſelf, of the Operation of the Spirit, that ſuch a Thing is done, tho' he knoweth not the manner of that Agency, or what its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs may be. Man is excluded any ſhare in ſo Noble a Production; It is here by our SAVIOUR expreſly aſcribed to the HOLY SPIRIT, Which therefore is ſufficient to Eſtabliſh the Truth before us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>THIS is done Freely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT proceeds from the Meer good Will &amp; Pleaſure of Him that worketh or giveth it, without any reſpect to any thing done, or deſerved by the Receiver. There is no Obligation lying on the Giver, nor any attractive virtue in him that Receives it. Nor is there any thing can be done by Man in a way of Recompence for it, that can be
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003123_0013_0FF002C46DA739B0"/>
conſidered as a Motive to an Infinite GOD to do it. That Incomprehenſibly Great &amp; Glorious Being, who has all Perfection and Bleſſedneſs in himſelf Independently and Eternally ſo, can want nothing from Man; or what has the Creature, which it did not receive from Him, when it can have nothing of excellency, but he muſt firſt give it? If he deals out Favours they muſt be free acts of his good Pleaſure. And how deſtitute of a Motive to ſuch a Gift is Man on whom it is conferred; a Wretched, Impure, and Guilty Creature, vile beyond the reach of our thoughts, in as unpitiable a ſtate as can well be conceived of, ſuch as no Created Eye can find a Heart to pity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. <hi>begin.</hi> What can the Sinner deſerve from GOD, or have in him of Motive, to perſwade to the beſtowing any Bleſſings upon him? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle declares them in the Context deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Wrath; and what but Incentives of it, are or can be found in the Sinner; It muſt be aſtoniſhing Grace that ſhews Kindneſs to a Sinner; that changes his Heart, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the Image of Satan in it, and draws there the Image of GOD. Let Man put forth the utmoſt of his Powers in this caſe, yet ſtill he is deſerving of Wrath. He is notwithſtanding all he can do, an Impure Creature, under the Reign of Sin, an Enemy

to GOD, To draw ſuch an one to CHRIST to believe to the ſaving of his Soul, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Free &amp; Rich Grace. <hi>It is rich Mercy, and from his Great Love wherewith he loveth ſuch, that they are Quickned,</hi> As in the 4<hi>th.</hi> and 5<hi>th. verſes</hi> of the Context. And thus our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR reſolves it, Mat. 11.26. <hi>Even ſo, Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi> And the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1,—9.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>IT is from Grace, That ſuch as believe on CHRIST are made to Perſevere in Faith and Holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE are Two things Implied in this Propoſition, which may be diſtinctly ſpoken to.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT ſuch as believe <hi>ſhall Perſevere in Faith and Holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>FREE Grace is the Fountain of their Perſevering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>BELIEVERS ſhall Perſevere in their believing to the End.</hi> The Grace that any Creature has, conſidered in it ſelf, is defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and may be totally loſt. It depends upon the Original of it for its continuance; and by the Great Author of it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued; and by Him will be ſo in every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003123_0014_0FF002AA4A3B2FB8"/>
in the Soul, although there may be frequent Intermiſſions, and Interruptions, with regard to the actings of it. It is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Principle in the Soul, which GOD ſuffers not to dye, but is as our SAVIOUR ſpeaks of it, Joh. 4.14. <hi>A Well of Water, ſpringing up into Everlaſting Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Truth of their Perſeverance in Faith and Holineſs, may be confirmed by Two Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">[1] THAT <hi>of their Election.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">[2] <hi>OF the Promiſe of GOD, made to ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">[1] THEIR <hi>Perſeverance may be argued from</hi> the Decree <hi>of their Election.</hi> Such as are Elected are Choſen to Eternal Life. They <hi>are choſen to Salvation, through Sanctification of the Spirit, and Belief of the Truth,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. And being Elected to That, they will not fail of it. They are Elected to be made Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as well as Happy: to be brought to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Happineſs in a way of Holineſs, and every Individual Perſon thus Elected muſt needs Perſevere.</p>
            <p>THE Conſequence of the certain Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of Believers in Faith and Holineſs, being evident from the ſuppoſition, of their being Elected before of GOD thereto: and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003123_0015_0FF002C0A6360350"/>
That alone being the thing capable of a Queſtion in the Argument. A Word or Two may be offered to eſtabliſh that ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, viz <hi>That Believers are Elected to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life.</hi> Believers Indefinitely, is not intended, but Individual Perſons, who are choſen out of the reſt of the World by GOD, and Ordained to Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>AND this is Evident;</p>
            <p n="1">(1) FROM <hi>the Nature of the Divine Mind</hi>; To <hi>which every thing, and its own Reſolves, are Eternally and Unchangeably Preſent.</hi> Infinite Knowledge is a neceſſary Perfection of the Divine Mind: it ſeeth all things at once in one Comprehenſive view. There is no more, nor can there be any more of an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to, or Alteration in his Knowledge than in any other of his Perfections. The Ideas, or Perceptions of the Divine Mind, are not there ſucceſſively, as in the mind of the Creature. There are no more Ideas in the Divine Mind, at one time, than at another. (If I may ſo ſpeak, tho' in truth Succeſſion belongs not to the Divine Being) all his Ideas, or Perceptions are equally preſent and Eternally ſo. His <hi>Knowlege is ever One and the ſame, Simple, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niform, Unchangeable Perception of every thing.</hi> The Ideas therefore
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003123_0015_0FF002C0A6360350"/>
of all things which he ſaw fit to make, with all their Circumſtances, (particularly Men of which we are now ſpeaking) all their poſſible Relations, and every Action that would be performed by them In a word, every thing relating to his Government of them, and the particular manner, of his Manifeſting the Glory of this, or the other of his Perfections, in &amp; about every particular Perſon, were Eternally preſent in the Divine Mind. And the <hi>Determinations</hi> of the ſame <hi>Infinite Mind,</hi> with reſpect to every Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Perſon, or the manifeſting of any of his Perfections in any way whatſoever rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to any, &amp; every of them, are as <hi>Eternal,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeable,</hi> as <hi>his Perception</hi> about the ſame. The Contrary would ſuppoſe a Change in the Divine Perception, inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the nature of the Divine Mind. Which therefore demonſtrates, that he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved from Eternity, to whom in Special he would diſcover the Glory of his Grace; where he would beſtow his Benefits, whom in particular he would prepare for, and bring to an Everlaſting Inheritance in the World to come. <hi>Such as he did fore-know, them alſo he has Predeſtinated; and whom he Predeſtinated, them he alſo Called; and whom he Called, them he alſo Juſtified; and whom he Juſtified, them he alſo Glorified,</hi> Rom. 8.29, 30.</p>

               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:003123_0016_0FF002A7EFBD67B0"/>(2) THIS Truth, may be alſo Argued, from the <hi>abſolute Certainty there was from Eternity, of the accompliſhment of the End of CHRIST's Death.</hi> The End of CHRIST's Death, was to bring Glory to GOD in the Salvation of Sinners. It would be a great Reflection upon Infinite Wiſdom, to ſuppoſe that GOD would ſend his SON into the World upon any Poſſible uncertainty, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever that end would be anſwered, or not. Of Neceſſity then, the deſign of that great Work muſt have been Abſolutely, and in the Firmeſt manner ſecured, ſo that it could not poſſibly fail. For if it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for it to fail, then it might have failed, and ſo CHRIST might have died in vain. There being then the higheſt Certainty of the Accompliſhment of this End, even equal to the Certainty of CHRIST's Death it ſelf. It was then abſolutely Determined by GOD; as it was that CHRIST ſhould be a <hi>Saviour and that by his Death.</hi> as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10, 11. If then the end of GOD in CHRIST's Death, by his determination, be moſt firmly and certainly Secured; it alſo thence follows, that the Salvation of ſome, a number of the fallen Race of Adam, is by his determination moſt firmly Aſcertained; their Salvation, (or GOD's Glory in their Salvation) being this very deſign, ſo certainly ſecured. If
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003123_0016_0FF002A7EFBD67B0"/>
therefore by a Divine Reſolve the Salvation of ſome is abſolutely aſcertained: Then there is a Deſignation of the very Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that make up that Number, in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mind, to Faith and Eternal Salvation. For ſince this Salvation in every part of it is the Gift of GOD: there could not have been this Certainty from Eternity, of their being Poſſeſſed of it, unleſs by a Reſolve in the Divine Mind of ſo beſtowing it. Which Reſolve muſt neceſſarily Relate to the Individuals, on whom he will beſtow it; Since every Act of his, upon the Creature, ſuppoſes a preceding Reſolve; and every Reſolve of GOD is Eternal and without Change.</p>

            <p>THE Election then of particular Perſons to Salvation through Sanctification of the Spirit, and Belief of the Truth, being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; their Perſeverance in Faith is alſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.

This that HE gives ſo allays the Thirſt, that he who drinks of it never Thirſts more, and abideth a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, and Everlaſting ſpring.

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003123_0018_0FF002A3D382EB38"/>
ſuppoſe their being Plucked out of his Hand. The Believers Perſeverance in Grace is by theſe Promiſes ſecured, they are put in Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Terms, and don't leave the matter at the uncertainty of their Will. If they don't contain Perſeverance in them, the matter is yet to ſeek, what they do contain. For if they muſt be underſtood <hi>Conditionally</hi> (as ſome would underſtand them, <hi>viz.</hi>) <q>That while the Sheep keep cloſe to CHRIST, no Devourer ſhall be able to annoy them, or pluck them from CHRIST's Hand,</q>) there ſeems to be nothing at all in them: For, if they do keep cloſe to CHRIST, (or which is the very ſame thing, Perſevere in their Faith,) then they do ſo. And without this Promiſe it would have been as true, If they Perſevere that they do Perſevere, And if it be not by Virtue of any Grace ſecured to them in this Promiſe that they do Perſevere, they have nothing at all by it. And it unavoidably throws us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Abſurdity of making Perſeverance a Condition of it ſelf. For here is a preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation promiſed to the Believer, ſo as he ſhall never be plucked out of the Al-powerful Hand of CHRIST, and this Interpretation (of its being Conditional,) ſuppoſes the Believers cloſely adhering to CHRIST, (or which is the ſame thing, this preſervation it
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:003123_0019_0FF002B740833DA8"/>
ſelf) to precede what this Promiſe ſecures; So that his following CHRIST is not by Virtue of what this Promiſe does for him, for that which is Conſequent affords no ſtrength to a preceding Act. So that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſuppoſes, he muſt firſt do the thing it ſelf promiſed and that then he ſhall have the thing Promiſed; which is moſt abſurd. This and the Promiſes then of the like nature, ſecure <hi>Perſeverance</hi> it ſelf to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, that the being of Grace ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in them. So that they ſhall never be plucked out of CHRIST's Hand.</p>
            <p n="2">2. FREE <hi>Grace</hi> is the <hi>Fountain</hi> of this. It is from Grace that Believers are what they are, and are kept to his Kingdom. It is he that begun the work in them that Carries it on. As Free Grace was the Spring of its beginning, ſo alſo of its whole Proceſs and Perfection. Thoſe Acts of GOD by which this is done were wholly at his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: The Security which they have from the Election &amp; the Promiſe of GOD, points them wholly to the Good Pleaſure of GOD. For what more free than the Act of GOD ſingling them out, and appointing them to Eternal Salvation? It was wholly at his Pleaſure to chooſe them or not. There was nothing of motive in them to it. It
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003123_0019_0FF002B740833DA8"/>
was not becauſe of their Faith that he choſe them, but he beſtows Faith according to his Election. Eph. 1.3, 4. <hi>According as he has Choſen us</hi> It is Impoſſible there ſhould be any good in men before GOD gives it to them. And inconceivable then that they ſhould have any, except he willed it, or that any thing in them ſhould be the reaſon of his willing it to them. So that his Free Election of them, is the Spring of all the Grace they have. So alſo is the Promiſe free. This was his Gracious Pleaſure to make ſuch a Promiſe to them: the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Rich Grace of GOD is what Saints adore as the Fountain of all the good that is derived to them, of their Security, &amp; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from all their Spiritual Enemies, unto the Eternal Kingdom of GOD. <hi>It is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in GOD they Glory,</hi> &amp; <hi>Cry Grace, Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>IT is from Grace that the Salvation of Believers is Perfected in GLORY.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD does not begin a work in us, and leave us to our ſelves, but goes thorough with it. <hi>He that begins will finiſh, Phil.</hi> 1.6.

And as Believers have Adoring thoughts of the Grace of GOD in thoſe beginnings of Salvation they have here: So they are Raiſed higher, and loſt in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the Incomprehenſible Rich Grace, that hath provided, and will beſtow ſuch a Glory upon them in the other World, as the Compleat Aſſimilation of their natures to the Divine Being, and Enjoyment of him ſo far as the Capacity of their natures will admit of: Such a Glory as <hi>neither Eye has ſeen nor Ear heard, neither hath entered into the Heart of Man to conceive how great.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 29.</p>

            <p>THIS Doctrine Vindicates the Juſtice of GOD in leaving ſo many Nations of the World without the Knowledge of a SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR. He is Righteous in ſuch a Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,

ſince the Sinners Salvation is of Grace. It was an Act of Sovereign Grace, to ſend a SAVIOUR into the World; It muſt alſo be an Act of meer Grace the Publication of it to any of the Sons of men. There is no people on the Earth to whom this in a way of Juſtice is due. It is of Grace, as hath been ſhewn, that a SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR is made known to any. The Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging of it as a Debt is Inconſiſtent with its being meerly of Grace. It is an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Diſpenſation, depending purely upon the Pleaſure of GOD; and therefore no Wrong is done to thoſe that are ſuffered to Live in the world without hearing of a SAVIOUR. Nor will they be able to Plead at laſt, it was a hardſhip, or any thing Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, that they were Left without the Knowledge of a way of obtaining Pardon and Life; which was granted to Others that were Sinners as well as they. For it is moſt Equal GOD ſhould be Acknowledged LORD of his own Goods; And that He may make a difference in giving out Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to thoſe that are equally Unworthy. None can Claim, nor find fault therefore if all are denied. Nor can ſome therefore have any Reaſon to Complain that they go without, if GOD pleaſes to manifeſt a Free Mercy to Others.

            </p>
            <p>IF our Salvation be wholly of Grace, how can any thing of Self come in, as a Cauſe or Motive thereto; or any thing we are or can do, be a ground why it is beſtowed? They will Exclude one the other. If any Thing of ours be the Cauſe, Motive or ground of Salvation, then it is not wholly of Grace: And if it be wholly of Grace, then all of Self is wholly Excluded, As the Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>If it be of Works, then it is not of Grace; but if it be of Grace, then it is not of Works. Otherwiſe Grace were no more grace.</hi> It being then wholly of Grace, Self muſt be wholly renounced. Grace, can have no Partner. This means not to countenance Spiritual Sloth; That becauſe perſons can't Earn their Salvation in a way of Doing, that therfeore they may be Excus'd from taking pains in the matter. To this they are bound, To ſtrive to Enter in, to offer Violence to
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:003123_0021_0FF0029FF3BC6280"/>
the Kingdom of Heaven, is what they are particularly directed to: And without which they have no Encouragement, that Divine Grace will appear for their help. But none of this may be reſted in. This Doctrine, That Salvation is wholly of the free Grace of GOD, gives no countenance to any to flatter themſelves, that becauſe they have done this or that, taken a great deal of pains in Religion, and with their own Hearts, that therefore GOD won't deny them Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and Life: But beats them, from look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon any thing they are, or do, as what can any ways move GOD or bind him to give Grace. For, if it is of Grace. <hi>If he gives it, only becauſe he will give it,</hi> Then not becauſe they do any thing; not becauſe of what they are, or do. Every thing of their own is nothing, as to the Motive of GOD's giving. Therefore every thing of our own is to be wholly Renounced, as any ways com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending us to the Sovereign Mercy of GOD. The beſt we do in the matter of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be accounted by us, as menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rags, and the entire Glory given to free Grace, that raiſes us from the moſt filthy and Miſerable State. Perſons tho' they will profeſſedly diſclaim any dependance upon themſelves, and reſting in any thing they do for Salvation; and flatter themſelves they
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:003123_0022_0FF002A6252D1ED0"/>
do not. Yet how common is it that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their own, or ſomething they have done, or are doing, which Terminates in Self, is a ground of their Confidence. 'Tis directly contrary to Corrupt Nature to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Self; and to own all its Salvation depends upon the Meer Pleaſure of GOD, and muſt ſpring from pure Mercy; and therefore is trying many ways to bring GOD as it were under ſome Obligation to grant it. By various methods natural Men at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to bring GOD under ſome Tie or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to beſtow Salvation upon them, which Evidence they don't Renounce Self, and their loathneſs to it. Some may be juſt hinted at:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SOMETIMES they are ready to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves, that what they do inclines In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Mercy to Pity them.</hi> He is abundant in Mercy and full of Compaſſion, and they hope he will be ready to Pity them in Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; that their Confeſſion, Sorrows and Cries will come up before Him, and encline him to exerciſe tenderneſs towards them, as they <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3. They were ready to wonder, why GOD did not obſerve what they did and Pity them. But the Heart of GOD is not moved to exerciſe Mercy from what Men <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>. He does it freely, becauſe it Pleaſes Him.</p>

               <hi>SOME Perſons by endeavouring to make their Hearts better, hope to Induce GOD to exerciſe Mercy towards them.</hi> They Imagine if they could get ſome good diſpoſitions in their Hearts, that GOD would be pleaſed with them. But tho' Sinners may get their Hearts greatly affected with ſorrow for their Sins, and have many Religious affections, yet their Hearts are really no better than they were before. There is nothing but Sin there, in its full Reign, and this lifting up of themſelves, upon their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Religious frames, evidences the Pride of their Hearts, and their oppoſition to the free Grace of GOD. For That moves of it ſelf freely, againſt all deſert of the contrary in us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SOME hope to gain the Favour of GOD by the Services and Duties they do in Religion.</hi> Many fancy the Anger of GOD towards them may be Pacified in this way, and if they are Conſtant in Duties and Religious Services, that they ſhall in time move GOD towards them and procure his Grace. But this is ſtill bringing Self as a ground, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, for Free Grace to act upon, Which finds nothing without it ſelf to move it: Self and every thing relating to it is therefore to be renounced, GOD is Gracious always of his own accord, Nothing of ours procures

What was it firſt looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, but the Eternal rich Grace of GOD? And what hath it done for us? Even that which Infinitely Tranſcends our thoughts. When we had made our ſelves Slaves of Sin, and Satan, and Children of the Curſe it gave a Redeemer, the Eternal Son of GOD, to Ranſom us from Deſtruction: to break in pieces the Policy, and ſtrength of Hell; and Reſcue us from the vileſt Servitude, and the greateſt Miſery. Not becauſe he wanted us; for his Glory would not have Faded, if we had lain Eternally in our Ruins. Nor was it any Betterneſs in us,

that gave us the preference; nor becauſe there was any greater Readineſs in us to Comply with the offers of his Grace. The like Sinfulneſs, the like Oppoſition to his Grace, the like Unbelief was found in us, as in others. This was his good Pleaſure to look towards us; Aſtoniſhing Grace! When we were in our Blood, and no eye Pitied us, not our own; then was the time of his Love. He ſaw our wretchedneſs, and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Ingratitude, the Filthy, Loathſom, Guilty ſtate, Sin had brought us into; and what it would coſt for our Ranſom. A Price of Infinite worth He ſaw how the Love that paid down that Price, would be deſpiſed &amp; trampled on by us: And the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of our Hearts, to that Pardon, and Happineſs, ſo Purchaſed and deſigned for us: and that after all he ſhould never be Advantaged by us. Yet that amazingly Rich Grace, delighted in deſigning, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing the work of his Grace in us. What can all this deſerve, and call for? All we have and can do is Infinitely below it. And what is the leaſt, but a Thankful Admiration of it. What GOD expects is that we own it: That we be willing he ſhould Save us Freely.

This Doctrine aſſures us, that Free Grace lays hold of a Sinner in all his Deformity, Unworthineſs &amp; Nakedneſs; and therefore with this, and a Senſe of all this he muſt betake himſelf to Free Grace in CHRIST. It is to free Grace we muſt be beholden for all that we want. And what does our ſtaying away ſhew? But that

either we imagine, we have not ſo much need to be beholden to it; or are unwilling to be ſo much obliged by it. What ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are our Hearts to our own good? How averſe to the Glory of free Grace? That has provided all for us in CHRIST; an Infinite fulneſs is there Treaſured up: And Free Grace tenders it all. All we want may be had for going for. This is the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to us; <hi>If any man Thirſt, let him come to Me and Drink, Joh.</hi> 7.37. <hi>He every one that Thirſteth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no Money; come ye, Buy, and Eat, you, come, Buy Wine and Milk, without Money, and without Price, Iſa.</hi> 55.1. Here are Treaſures of Infinite value ſet before us, without any Price; ſo is it expreſly, <hi>Come and Take without Money.</hi> We muſt know we have nothing to bring, and are nothing.

Such an attempt is vain. But in that very State Sin has brought us into, &amp; in a ſenſe of it, be it never <hi>ſo Wretched, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and Poor, and Blind, and Naked, Rev.</hi> 3.17.
