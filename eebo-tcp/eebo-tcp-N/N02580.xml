            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Venerable <hi>Author</hi> of the enſuing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, who was <hi>forever deviſing</hi> Good, thinking how ſerviceable and glorious it would be, if when <hi>Matrimony</hi> is Solemnized, it might be done with <hi>Devotion</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and with a Concern that, when the <hi>Hands</hi> are <hi>joined</hi> and ſo the <hi>united Hearts</hi> are ſignified, there may be a <hi>Deſire</hi> of their Souls and a <hi>Conſent</hi> of their <hi>Wills,</hi> that their SAVIOUR may be theirs, <hi>eſpouſed</hi> unto them and <hi>concerned</hi> for them: I ſay, the Venerable <hi>Author,</hi> reflecting on theſe things, prepared the following Diſcourſe for the Direction of (<hi>all</hi> indeed, but more eſpecially) thoſe engaging in this <hi>uſeful &amp; Heavenly Inſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Sermon</hi> was preached and fitted for the Preſs ſome Months before the <hi>Author's</hi> Death, who compoſed it for <hi>an agreeable Preſent unto the Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates of Wedlock</hi>; and as <hi>ſuch</hi> it is approved by <hi>ſeveral Miniſters,</hi> who hope, with me, that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will anſwer the <hi>pious Intentions</hi> of the Writer; while he is <hi>above</hi> rejoycing in JESUS CHRIST, the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> of his Soul.</p>

            <head type="sub">The moſt Marvellous <hi>Propoſal</hi> that ever was made among the Children of Men, calls now for a moſt Admiring <hi>Attention</hi> from us.</head>
            <p>Tis that in, <bibl>Rom. VII.4.</bibl>
               <q>That ye ſhould be MARRIED unto HIM who is Raiſed from the Dead.</q>

            <p>CAN ſuch a Thing be heard with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Aſtoniſhment! —<hi>Sing O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and be Joyful, O Earth, and break forth into Singing, O Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>; For, Oh! how aſtoniſhing are the <hi>Comforts</hi> which the Glorious Lord has for his Choſen People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Married</hi> unto a Glorious Christ, <hi>Raiſed from the Dead,</hi> and ſo taken up to, and ſitting down on, the <hi>Throne of GOD.</hi> O Wonderful! O Wonderful! The Soul of a poor, Fooliſh, Filthy Creature; the Soul of a Miſerable Sinner,—<hi>Married</hi> unto the Only Begotten Son of God, who has all the Angels in the Heavens forever Ordered by Him, and Ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Him! To be <hi>Commanded</hi> by Him, is a <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>; To be <hi>Employed</hi> for Him, is an <hi>Advancement,</hi> beyond what we can deſire. But then, to be <hi>Married</hi> unto Him!—<hi>Seemeth it a light matter unto you,</hi> O
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003061_0004_0FEFB325265EFF80"/>
Children of Men! Verily, tis a matter which cannot (be ſufficiently wondred at! But it is a matter, which we now have in proſecution and in expectation.</p>
            <p>Behold, an llluſtrious Demonſtration, That Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers on a Glorious Christ are delivered from the <hi>Dominion of Sin.</hi> The <hi>Evil principle</hi> which diſpoſes us to Sin, is mortified and extinguiſhed in Believers, to ſuch a degree, that tho' the <hi>Continuance</hi> of it is an Intolerable <hi>Vexation</hi> unto them, yet it has not a <hi>Dominion</hi> over them. While we remain under the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> or the <hi>Covenant</hi> made with the <hi>Firſt Adam,</hi> as the <hi>Head</hi> of his <hi>Natural Offspring,</hi> we are under a Law which requires a <hi>perfect Obedience</hi> from us, but at the ſame time it affords us no <hi>Strength</hi> for that <hi>Obedience</hi>: No; our <hi>Corrupt Nature</hi> is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by irritated unto <hi>Rebellion</hi> rather than annimated unto <hi>Obedience,</hi> and [the <hi>Evil Principle</hi> gains the Force of a <hi>Law</hi> upon us. The Law which in <hi>it ſelf</hi> is <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> in the <hi>Event</hi> is turned into, a <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> unto us. If we read a few Lines more, we cannot but ſtand amazed at the Blindneſs of them, who exclude the <hi>Moral Law</hi> of the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> from the meaning of the Apoſtles, and expound it only for the Law of the <hi>Moſaical Ceremonies,</hi> when here we read of being <hi>Delivered from the Law.</hi> But now, our Bleſſed Jesus is a <hi>Second Adam.</hi> And by our being united unto HIM, we are brought into a <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> In that <hi>Covenant</hi> the Redeemer, to whom we are <hi>united,</hi> makes Attonement for our Treſpaſſes, againſt the <hi>Law,</hi> anſwers the Demands of the <hi>Law</hi> in our ſtead, and conveys into us by his Good Spirit a <hi>principle of Life,</hi> which quickens us to endeavour a <hi>perfection of Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Strengthens</hi> us to make a Gradual Progreſs towards a <hi>perfection of Holineſs in the Fear of GOD.</hi> Thus we become <hi>Dead unto the Law</hi>! Our Hopes of obtaining the <hi>Juſtification of Life</hi> by our own doing of the <hi>Works</hi> which the <hi>Law</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,

are all <hi>Dead.</hi> We have laid aſide all Hopes of coming to <hi>Life,</hi> on thoſe Terms of the <hi>Law, Do and Live.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> is alſo <hi>Dead</hi> unto us, and can make no more claim upon us, to adhere unto thoſe Terms of, <hi>Do and Live,</hi> than a <hi>Dead Man</hi> can upon one that he was once by <hi>Marriage</hi> a Maſter of. Chriſtians, You have the very <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Marrow</hi> of the Goſpel, and a plain Gloſs upon a famous Paragraph of the Sacred Scriptures, in theſe few Communications. But what is our Condition in this <hi>Change of our State</hi> before the Lord? And what is it that brings us into this Happy Condition? Tis this Marvellous Felicity; Our <hi>Marriage</hi> with a Redeemer that is <hi>Raiſed from the Dead.</hi> Of this I am now to Entertain you with a DOCTRINE, that brings unto us thoſe <hi>Conſolatioas of GOD,</hi> which, O <hi>Hard-Hearted</hi> we, if they be <hi>Small</hi> unto us!</p>
            <p>A Soul <hi>Married</hi> unto a Jesus <hi>Raiſed from the Dead,</hi> is an <hi>Happy</hi> Soul. And it is by <hi>Marrying</hi> of us unto Himſelf that a Glorious CHRIST brings us to all the <hi>Happineſs,</hi> which He has purpos'd and purchas'd for us. Our Apoſtle, Speaking of a People by his Miniſtry brought home unto GOD, and made an Happy People, ſays, 2 Cor. XI.2. <hi>I have Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed you unto one Husband, that I may preſent you as a chaſt Virgin unto CHRIST.</hi> This, This is the main intent and buſineſs of the Evangelical Miniſtry. The Miniſters of the Goſpel are thoſe <hi>Friends of the Bridegroom,</hi> that have a Work to do upon that Noble Deſign; To <hi>Eſpouſe</hi> the Souls of their People, unto a Glorious Christ, who is willing to become an <hi>Husband</hi> unto them. Now to bring about this Bleſſedneſs to the Souls, with and for whom we are concerned, we are going to lay before you the moſt Important Things, that ever you were addreſſed upon; And we make our Addreſs to you, with ſuch a pathetic Obſervation, <hi>Hearken to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003061_0006_0FEFB32A754A9BD0"/>
me, that GOD may hearken unto you another Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The Glorious REDEEMER makes unto your <hi>Souls,</hi> O our Goſpelized People, a Propoſal to make you Happy in an ESPOUSAL unto Himſelf.</p>
            <p>Can our Souls be any other than ſwallowed up with Admiration at the <hi>Myſtery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Infinite Son of GOD, <hi>Eſpouſed</hi> the <hi>Nature</hi> of Man, when <hi>the Word was made Fleſh,</hi> and he condeſcended ſo far as to take a Man in <hi>One Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> with Himſelf. The Almighty King, overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Tribes of <hi>Created,</hi> and even of <hi>Angelic</hi> Beings, <hi>Eſpouſed</hi> unto Himſelf a Queen, from the Family of <hi>Mankind.—Lord what are we? And what is our Fathers Houſe?</hi> This He did, tho' He ſaw the Depravation which Mankind by a Fall from God comes to Sink into. A Thing which, Oh! how ſhould we celebrate the <hi>Grace</hi>! <hi>Grace</hi>! that we ſee ſhining in it! What an Honour does it put upon the Humane Race! And how ſhould it Encourage our Approaches unto our GOD.</p>
            <p>But now, the GOD-MAN, or Immanuel, is upon the Glorious Deſign of <hi>Eſpouſing</hi> to Himſelf a Church of People, cull'd and call'd out of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> into the <hi>Faith</hi> of Him. There is a CHURCH of Believers on Him, a <hi>People formed for himſelf, to ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w forth his praiſe,</hi> whom in a Myſtical MARRIAGE He reckons Himſelf <hi>Eſpouſed</hi> unto. This Church is by that <hi>Lamb of GOD</hi> Expreſſly called, <hi>his WIFE</hi>: And Effectually bringing this People into a <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with God, He ſays, Jer. III.14. <hi>I Marry my ſelf unto you.</hi> Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe with whom we are principally now concerned, would be little edified; with the Traditions among the <hi>Jews,</hi> of the <hi>Marriage</hi> between <hi>Tipheret</hi> and <hi>Maleuth,</hi> [So the Jewiſh Thrology calls the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and his <hi>Church</hi>] which we apprehend repreſented in the Song of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and in the <hi>Forty-fifth Pſalm</hi> of his Father <hi>David,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:003061_0007_0FEFB33FC2BE7FD8"/>
which that Song was built upon. Tis enough to ſay, That People bro't into the Life of GOD, have that word fulfill'd unto them; Hoſ. II.18, 19. <hi>I will eſpouſe thee unto me for ever; yea, I Will eſpouſe thee unto me in Juſtice, and in Judgment, and in Loving-Kindneſs, and in Mercies. I will even eſpouſe thee unto me in Faithfulneſs, and thou ſhalt know the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, What we would more particularly inſist upon, is, That every particular Soul brought home unto God, is <hi>Eſpouſed</hi> unto the SON of God. GOD the KING <hi>Eternal, Immortal, Inviſible, makes a Marriage for His SON</hi> in the <hi>Converſion of a Sinner</hi> to Him. In the moment that any of you make the Flight of a Diſtreſſed Soul unto your SAVIOUR, who has in Him the <hi>Only Name,</hi> [even the Name of JEHOVAH] <hi>whereby we muſt be ſaved,</hi> and entreat of Him, and rely on Him, for His <hi>Great Salvation,</hi> from that Moment thou art Eſpouſed unto Him, and in whatever part of the Earth He finds thee, His Voice to thee, is that, Iſa. LIV.5. <hi>Thy Maker is thy Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ; and thy Redeemer; the G0D of the whole Earth ſhall he be called.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, This is the <hi>Eſpouſal,</hi> unto which, O Soul Enjoying the <hi>Joyful Sound</hi> of the Goſpel, thou art now therein Sollicited.</p>
            <p>The Method of coming into the unparallell'd <hi>Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,</hi> and ſo unto Everlaſting <hi>Happinſes,</hi> is briefly this.</p>
            <p>There is a COVENANT of Life, wherein the SON of GOD has engaged theſe Two things unto his FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, on the behalf of his People which are in the Eternal <hi>Election</hi> of GOD <hi>given</hi> unto Him: The Firſt That he will by anſwering the Law of GOD for them, furniſh them with a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and a <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> on the pleading whereof they ſhall be <hi>Forgiven</hi> and <hi>Accepted</hi> with Him: The Second, That He will write the <hi>Law</hi> of GOD in their Hearts, and <hi>Heal</hi> all that is amiſs in them, and <hi>work in them
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003061_0008_0FEFB32C76A570E0"/>
what is well pleaſing in the ſight of GOD,</hi> and having by a <hi>Sanctifying work</hi> upon their <hi>whole Man,</hi> prepared them for the <hi>Inheritance of the Saints,</hi> bring them to the <hi>Spiritual Bleſſings of the Heavenly places.</hi> A Soul deſiring to be comprehended in the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this COVENANT, and conſenting that a Glorious CHRIST ſhould <hi>fulfill</hi> for it and in it, all <hi>this Good Pleaſure of His Goodneſs,</hi> is brought into the COVENANT of Grace, and is therein <hi>Eſpouſed unto the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Tranſaction appears under the Character of a <hi>Marriage,</hi> becauſe from this Time, there is an UNION, and not only a <hi>Legal Union,</hi> but alſo a <hi>Vital Union,</hi> between the <hi>Redeemer</hi> and the <hi>Believer.</hi> It comes to that, Joh. XIV.20. <hi>You in Me, and I in You:</hi> As upon an Eſpouſal, the <hi>Married Couple</hi> becomes <hi>One fleſh,</hi> ſo the <hi>Redeemer</hi> and the <hi>Believer</hi> become ONE, both in point of <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and in point of <hi>Influence.</hi> The Debts of the <hi>Believer</hi> ly on the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and the <hi>Redeemer</hi> pays them all. The <hi>claims</hi> of the <hi>Redeemer</hi> are imparted unto the <hi>Believer,</hi> and the <hi>Believer</hi> is Entitled unto His precious <hi>Benefits</hi>; What He has bought belongs to thee, <hi>O thou Bleſſed of the Lord.</hi> At the ſame time the <hi>Redeemer</hi> does Converſe with the <hi>Believer</hi>; and <hi>follow him with Goodneſs and Mercy all his Days,</hi> and receives him into the <hi>Manſions</hi> of His <hi>Fathers Houſe</hi> at the proper period of his Days, and Show, Oh! <hi>What Wonders to the Dead!</hi> The <hi>Believer</hi> does depend on the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi> for all the <hi>Bleſſings of Goodneſs,</hi> and pay Him all poſſible <hi>Affection</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi>; Delighting in <hi>Communion</hi> with Him; and Reſolving to be <hi>for Him and not for another.</hi> He is thy Lord, and, O Loyal and Faithful one, Thou doſt <hi>Worſhip Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which gives yet a further Appearance of a <hi>Marriage</hi> in this Grand Affair, is, Its conformity to what paſſed in the Caſe of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and the <hi>Firſt Marriage,</hi> even that which was made in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:003061_0009_0FEFB3417107D588"/>
An Apoſtle of GOD Writing of that <hi>Marriage</hi> ſays, Eph. V.32. <hi>This is a Great Myſtery: But I ſpeak about CHRIST and his Church. Adam</hi> was thrown into a ſort of a <hi>Swoon,</hi> wherein GOD as I conceive, Extracted from his whole <hi>Inward,</hi> (which we render his <hi>Rib</hi>) the Subſtance, which He framed into the Shape that He gave to Eve, and which was <hi>Bone of his Bones, and Fleſh of his Fleſh</hi>: So that ſhe became his <hi>Conſort,</hi> who was alſo his <hi>Offspring.</hi> Accordingly a Glorious CHRIST having paſſed thro' the Agonies and Convulſions of <hi>Death</hi> for it, has thoſe produced for Him, and for a moſt Intimate and Endearing Fellowſhip with Him; who are alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <hi>from</hi> Him, and are indeed His <hi>Offspring.</hi> He Sees His own Seed in them, and He owns them for <hi>Members of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones.</hi> And <hi>as the Bridegroom rejoyces over the Bride, ſo ſhall thy GOD rejoyce over thee,</hi> O Soul, willing to be the Lord's.</p>
            <p>This then is the Thing propoſed by our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR to us. Yea, <hi>Hear this O all ye People, Every one of you!</hi> Tis to <hi>Every One of You</hi> all, that our SAVIOUR does propoſe it; and this is the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to be <hi>Preached unto Every Creature.</hi> Soul, be willing to come into an UNION with thy SAVIOUR.</p>
            <p n="2">II. O you to whom there is the <hi>Word</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Salvation</hi> ſent; Your <hi>Compliance</hi> with the <hi>Propoſal</hi> of your Glorious REDEEMER for your ESPOUSAL to Himſelf, does declare you <hi>Eſpous'd</hi> unto Him, and render you interminably Happy in Him. Tis the Speaking of ONE WORD, upon an overture of a <hi>Marriage,</hi> which determines the Matter. Soul, Tis the Hearty Speaking of ONE WORD which will <hi>Marry</hi> thee unto thy SAVIOUR. That ONE WORD, <hi>Receive me to thy Mercy, and thy Glory O my SAVIOUR.</hi> That ONE WORD, <hi>O my

CX.3. <hi>His Willing People.</hi> Tis their being made <hi>Willing</hi> to be <hi>His</hi> that makes them ſuch an <hi>Happy People.</hi> Soul, when thy SAVIOUR makes His Propoſal, <hi>Shall I take thee, and make thee my own, and Feed thee and Cloath thee, and Lead thee, and Shield thee, and uſe thee as my own, and bring thee to be all that I would have mine to be!</hi> Let thy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nquered Heart comply with it, and Reply, <hi>O my SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, I reſign my ſelf unto thee; do thou take poſſeſſion of me!</hi> Lo, <hi>Tis done! Tis done!</hi> This ONE WORD fetch'd from thy Heart by the <hi>Victorious Grace</hi> of GOD has Eternally Saved thee. The SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT of GOD inclining the Soul to ſay unto the SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, the <hi>Juſtifier, the Sanctifier, Oh! when will thou come unto me!</hi> He does thereby make that Soul a <hi>Bride</hi> for the SON of GOD. It is the <hi>Bride</hi> that ſays COME! He waits for that <hi>Voice</hi> of His Dove: <hi>Oh! Let not the only Comforter that can relieve my Soul be far from me: Let there no longer be a diſtance between me and my SAVIOUR; and let not my Sin hide His Face from me.</hi> Upon this He ſays, <hi>O my Dove, I take thee into the Clifts of the Rock: Thou ſhalt be under the ſhadow of my Wings forever.</hi> It may be Illuſtrated from the <hi>Eſpouſal</hi> of <hi>Rebeckah</hi> unto <hi>Iſaac.</hi> When the <hi>Glories</hi> and the <hi>Deſires</hi> of the Excellent Perſon, and of his Father, had been told her, and it was demanded, <hi>Wilt thou go unto him, and be his</hi>? Her anſwer of Complyance, <hi>I will go,</hi> Settled all; there needed no more to be ſaid. Soul, <hi>The Word of Truth, and Goſpel of thy Salvation,</hi> tells thee, The SON of GOD is a Perſon beyond all Imagination Glorious, and He is <hi>The Lord of all.</hi> He would gladly make thee <hi>His own</hi>: And His FATHER ſends His <hi>Goſpel,</hi> to inform thee and aſſure thee of it. Art thou willing
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003061_0011_0FEF973C562CBA30"/>
to <hi>Go</hi> and live with Him, and prize Him, and ſerve Him, and <hi>Be what he would have thee to be</hi>? That anſwer of Compliance, <hi>I will go,</hi> This will ſettle it; And His Holy SPIRIT will make a ſweet <hi>Seizure</hi> on thee; and He will have thee and hold thee for <hi>His own</hi> forevermore. Is it poſſible to reject ſuch a <hi>Motion!</hi>—</p>
            <p>But then, in <hi>Complying</hi> with it, moſt certainly, it will not be poſſible to be any other than inexpreſſibly <hi>Surprized</hi> at it. All the <hi>Surprize</hi> that was expreſſed by the Lady unto whom <hi>David</hi> ſent the Motion of her becoming his, muſt fall far ſhort of thy <hi>Surprize,</hi> and Marvel, and Rapture, upon this motion from the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Lord of David.</hi>—<q>What? The <hi>King of Glory</hi> Stoup at this rate! The <hi>King of King</hi>'s take ſuch an odious <hi>Leper</hi> into his Boſom, and one ſo <hi>full of putrifying Sores</hi>! The Infinite GOD, look with ſuch an Eye, upon ſuch a <hi>Worm of the Duſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The High and Lofty one who inhabits E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, Eſpouſe</hi> unto Himſelf this poor, <hi>Humble, Contrite</hi> and ſelf abhorring Soul. The Match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Thiſtle</hi> and the <hi>Cedar</hi> in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> had no <hi>Diſparity</hi> comparable unto this. One fetch'd from
a <hi>Generation of Vipers,</hi> to be a <hi>Bride</hi> for the <hi>Lamb of GOD!</hi> He that is <hi>of purer Eyes than to behold evil and cannot look upon Iniquity,</hi> with ſuch tender Eyes to <hi>behold</hi> one ſo full of <hi>Evil,</hi> and <hi>look</hi> ſo <hi>tenderly</hi> on one abounding with <hi>Iniquity</hi>! Lord, When thou feeſt me ſuch a <hi>Lothſome</hi> wretch, caſt out unto the <hi>lothing</hi> of my <hi>Perſon,</hi> as <hi>in the Day that I was born,</hi> is this the <hi>time of thy Love</hi>! Wilt thou now <hi>Enter into Covenant</hi> with me, and <hi>thoroughly waſh me,</hi> and gird me about with thy <hi>Fine Linnen,</hi> and adorn me with thy <hi>Jewels,</hi> and put thy <hi>Crown</hi> upon my Head, and make my <hi>Beauty perfect</hi> thro' thy <hi>Comelineſs</hi> which thou wilt put upon me! <hi>Is this the manner of Men, O Lord GOD!</hi>—I could never have believ'd it;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003061_0012_0FEFB32EF300C340"/>
But, <hi>Thy Thoughts and Ways are not like ours.</hi> Now, <hi>Lord, I believe it, help thou my unbelief!</hi> But, O ye Heavens, be you forever fill'd with the <hi>Praiſes,</hi> the <hi>Praiſes,</hi> the <hi>High Praiſes</hi> of this peerleſs <hi>Grace.</hi> Let the whole <hi>Earth</hi> be filled with the <hi>Glory</hi> of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>—I return.</p>
            <p>And I add, In our Compliance, with ſuch a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious motion, <hi>two things</hi> muſt not be forgotten. Remember <hi>This.</hi> We muſt reſolve to be forever and <hi>entirely</hi> at the Diſpoſal of our SAVIOUR; and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> with every thing that He will have to be done either <hi>on</hi> us, or <hi>by</hi> us. Our compliance muſt be <hi>without Reſerve.</hi> And Remember <hi>This.</hi> If we <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> with our SAVIOUR, we muſt own 'tis <hi>His Work</hi> that has <hi>drawn</hi> us and <hi>brought</hi> us and help't us to it. Our <hi>Compliance</hi> muſt not be aſcribed unto the <hi>Free-will,</hi> of an <hi>Heart</hi> that is <hi>Deſperately Wicked.</hi>

            <p n="3">III.

            <p>But now, in your <hi>Eſpouſal</hi> to Him. conſidering Him, as one <hi>Raiſed from the Dead</hi>; You are firſt of all made ſenſible, That the <hi>Glorious Goſpel of the Bleſſed GOD,</hi> Which aims to make you Happy in <hi>Eſpouſing</hi> you unto Him, is no <hi>Cunningly deviſed Fable.</hi> No, it has received ſuch an indiſputable <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,</hi> in the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our JESUS from the Dead, that it is no longer to be doubted of; it cannot without moſt Criminal <hi>Blaſphemies</hi> be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of.

            <p>But then, Your <hi>Eſpouſal</hi> unto your SAVIOUR, muſt feel yet more particular, and moſt moving and melting <hi>Encouragements</hi> from this conſideration.</p>
            <p>Conſider This. <q>O Glorious JESUS, <hi>Raiſed from the Dead,</hi> Thou art gone up to, and ſat down at, the <hi>Right hand of GOD.</hi> All the <hi>Caeleſtial Powers</hi> are thy Subjects and Servants; There is <hi>no Numbers of thy Armies.</hi> Yea, <hi>All Power in Heaven and Earth</hi> is given to thee; the <hi>Government</hi> of the whole World is in thy Almighty Hands. <hi>O my Soul what a SAVIOUR art thou to be Eſpouſed unto</hi>!</q>
