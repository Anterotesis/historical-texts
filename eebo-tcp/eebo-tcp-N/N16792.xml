            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>THREE ladies in two diſtant counties born,<note n="*" place="bottom">Two of them were born in the county of Plymouth; the other in the county of Eſſex—(the maiden name of this lady was Carlton). This is noticed that they may have the honour of giving birth to theſe ladies, who were an honour to their ſex; and that the ladies of the preſent age <hi>there,</hi> may labour to ſhine with equal luſtre. May the ladies in other counties, by theſe examples be fired with a laudable ambition to excel. The males of any taſte wiſh to ſee it: then would they lead them to their bowers with as much pleaſure as Adam did their mother Eve—and would think that Aſtrae with all her train, were returned to this earth. Then would the mountains and the little hills rejoice, while the flowers overſpread the lawns; and the little rivulets, as they ran from the Manadnocks, and every high hill, into the valleys, would murmur their praiſe: for their minds would be adorned with all the flowers which grow upon the banks of the Parnaſſian ſtreams. How would they ſhine!—Will not the ladies of the preſent ages that are rich in this worlds be rich in good works? Yes, they will: they will improve their own minds— and will ſcatter books among the poor of their ſex, that they may do the ſame, if they have minds capable of giving entertainment to a noble ambition; an ambition to deſire that their names may ſurvive the waſtes of time, and that they may ſet an example to the generations that ſhall come after thems to go and do likewiſe, that the ſtory of the nymphs may be no longer fabulous.</note>

They would ſmooth every roughneſs in the males, and remind them of that ſweet harmony which ſubſiſts in the angelick ſpheres, and tune their voices in praiſe of their Maker, that he had formed ſuch creatures to dwell upon the globe, to ſweeten the drops which diſtilled from their brows, when they were making the neceſſary preparations for life; yes, they would remind them of their mother Eve in her ſtate of innocence, and when ſhe ſhone in the walks of Paradiſe, before the ſerpent made his appearance.—But I have done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the reader may paſs on, and ſee how beautiful is a female's compoſition—when ſhe can mourn with them that mourn, and weep with them that weep.</p>

               <hi>Rachel</hi>'s Sepulchre; OR, A MEMORIAL OF Mrs. <hi>Lydia Willis,</hi> Taken, chiefly, from her Letters to Friends, on various occaſions.</head>
            <p>A DESIRE to preſerve the memory of worthy and beloved Friends, eſpecially of ſuch as have, thro' the courſe of their lives approved themſelves the friends of God, is not only founded in nature, but ſeems evidently warranted in the holy Scriptures. God has told us that <hi>the righteous ſhall be in everlaſting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> 
               <note n="(1)" place="bottom">Pſalms 112 6.</note>; and that <hi>the memory of the juſt is bleſſed</hi> 
               <note n="(2)" place="bottom">Prov. 10 7.</note>— Which implies the care of Providence, not by <hi>miracle,</hi> but by the <hi>uſe</hi> of <hi>proper means,</hi> in preſerving the memory of ſuch <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> perſons: While thoſe of an oppoſite character, thro' neglect, are forgotten. Their very name is blotted out; as it follows, <hi>but the name of the wicked ſhall rot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this principle, no doubt, and with this view even to perpetuate the memory of his beloved <hi>Rachel</hi> the <hi>Patriarch Jacob</hi> raiſed a monument over her grave Gen. 35, 19, 20, <hi>Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath; and Jacob ſet a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day:</hi> which was known, in after ages, to be <hi>Rachel's</hi> ſepulchre, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10, 2.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:021608_0004_0FB4113384A8E2E8"/>But there are other monuments equally durable and more inſtructive, due to the merits of some departed friends, which may be juſtly expected, as they are earneſtly deſired by the living; for this worthy end, that God may be glorified and praiſed, for his gifts and graces, beſtowed on the children of men, whereby he alone makes <hi>one</hi> to differ from <hi>another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>monuments</hi> here intended, are the <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Characters</hi> of perſons whoſe excellent ſpirit, chriſtian converſation, profitable writings and good works, do furniſh materials both to entertain and edify ſucceeding generations, who, without ſuch memorials, would entirely miſs the benefit.</p>
            <p>Tis with this view, and not without ſome hopes of attaining this end that I have, at the earneſt deſire of <hi>one</hi> (whom I could not deny) been perſuaded to gather up ſome pious remains of <hi>Mrs. Lydia Willis,</hi> whoſe memory is precious, ſo far as I have known, to all her acquaintance—peculiarly ſo to her beloved ſurviving huſband, near relations and intimate friends, for whoſe uſe, more eſpecially theſe pages are deſigned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Characters,</hi> I know, are oftentimes offenſive; and many unkind reflections, are occaſioned thereby, both on the living and the dead.—But why ſhould any be offended at a <hi>character truly drawn</hi>? Why take offence, at a ſimple narrative of <hi>facts,</hi> or a true and faithful account of thoſe virtues and good things, which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently took place and appeared, in the perſon's life! And this I take to be the main point, in giving a <hi>character,</hi> even to pay a ſacred regard to <hi>truth</hi> in relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>facts,</hi> or things that were really found, in the <hi>perſon</hi> deſcribed. And when all is ſaid <hi>in truth,</hi> we mean not, thereby, to exalt and praiſe the <hi>man himſelf,</hi> but <hi>to glorify God in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, to excite the living to praiſe the giver of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021608_0005_0FB411350592F0E0"/>
every good and perfect gift, as well as to comfort and edify her ſurviving friends, I ſhall in ſimplicity of heart, give a ſketch of <hi>Mrs. Willis</hi>'s Life and Character; more eſpecially as it appears in her <hi>familiar letters,</hi> wherein the genuine breathings of her ſoul are the moſt ſenſibly diſcovered, perhaps, of any way in which her ideas were communicated.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>theſe</hi> I have therefore ſelected a number, and giving the moſt of them at large, exactly as they were written with her own hand; except a grammatical defect hath, now and then, been ſupplyed. That her letters might appear in their native ſimplicity, I have not ſo much as corrected ſome <hi>inaccuracies,</hi> which a learned pen might have avoided.—The principal liberty that I have taken, is ſometimes to <hi>exchange</hi> a <hi>word</hi> for <hi>ſome other,</hi> which is more expreſſive of what was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently her meaning! and the <hi>word</hi> that is <hi>ſubſtituted,</hi> may be known by inverted comma's before and after it, thus "—"</p>
            <p>But ſome of her letters are wholly ſuppreſſed; and in thoſe that appear, ſome ſtricking paſſages are omitted, on account of the ſingular <hi>amity</hi> and <hi>friendſhip,</hi> that ſubſiſted between <hi>her</hi> and the <hi>living relative,</hi> to whom they were written; in whoſe hands ſhe knew herſelf to be ſafe, tho' ſhe wrote with the moſt unreſerved freedom.</p>
            <p>MRS. <hi>Lydia Willis,</hi> late virtuous Conſort of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Eliakim Willis,</hi> Paſtor of the ſecond Church of <hi>Malden,</hi> after ten days ſickneſs, died there, much lamented, on the 25th of <hi>January,</hi> 1767, in the 59th year of her age.</p>
            <p>She was born at <hi>Duxborough,</hi> April 1709, the only Daughter of Mr. <hi>Thomas Fiſh</hi> of that Town, deceaſed.</p>
            <p>A Deſcription of her perſon, (with ſome principal branches of her character) is aptly and truly drawn, by another hand, as entered at the cloſe of this account.</p>
            <p>And yet, to compleat the view of her perſon, there is
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021608_0006_0FB4113685C3A988"/>
room to add, that ſhe was of an eligible <hi>ſtature</hi> and <hi>proportion.</hi> Her <hi>viſage</hi> comely eſpecially in youth, nor wholly defac'd in age.<note n="*" place="bottom">It might have been ſaid, ſhe was ſo in age to an uncommon degree.</note>—On her <hi>countenance</hi> dwelt a peculiar <hi>ſeriouſneſs</hi> and <hi>pleaſancy,</hi> ſo agreeably compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to demand reſpect, while it ſenſibly invited to nearneſs and freedom of converſe.</p>
            <p>As a grateful acknowledgement to the father of lights, it may be ſaid, that under the influence of a careful and religious education, her youth was preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>blemiſh.</hi> So that ſhe entered the ſocial life, in good repute among her companions.</p>
            <p>An early taſte for <hi>reading</hi> led her to acquaint her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as opportunity favoured, with <hi>authors,</hi> polite as well as religious; the <hi>latter</hi> more eſpecially, ſuited her attention.—This rendered her converſation edifying, while it agreeably entertained her diſcerning acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. So that ſhe was favoured with the beſt ſociety that her rural ſituation and the times afforded.</p>
            <p>A good talent at <hi>writing</hi> gave her the advantage of a profitable correſpondence; which many ſpecial provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences occaſioned her frequently to improve.—Her conſtitution (being of the moſt delicate &amp; tender make) ſubjected her to habitual weakneſs, and frequent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing ſickneſſes; which, together with numerous other adverſe providences, made her indeed a woman of ſorrow and acquainted with grief.—She was a perſon of uncommon trials and afflictions, from her early days. Which, however, did not ſink her ſpirits, but rather tended, for the moſt part, to wake up and invigorate every faculty, and manifeſt to others, rather than herſelf.</p>
            <p>She abounded in love and tender affections, not only to her near relations, but to all mankind—A mind, ſuſceptable of the deepeſt impreſſions, diſpoſs'd her to joy and ſorrow, in their turns, proportionable to every intereſting event.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:021608_0007_0FB411380525EEA0"/>On ſuch occaſions, her letters are moſt expreſſive of what ſhe felt.—But as croſſes and afflictions were fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to her, even from her youth. Theſe were, moſt frequently, the moving ſubjects, on which ſhe wrote.— In a very low ſtate of health, and under ſome peculiar trials, ſhe writes, to her brother at Stonington, upon his <hi>marriage,</hi> and ſettlement there.</p>

Madam <hi>Robinſon,</hi> virtuous and amiable conſort of Rev. Mr. <hi>John Robinſon,</hi> (then Miniſter at <hi>Duxborough</hi>) and her daughter, were drowned at the ſame time. <hi>[She was the mother of the late governour Trumbull's lady of Connecticut, and one of the wives of the Rev. Jacob Eliot, of Lebanon, deceaſed; and of the wife of the late Rev. Abel Stiles of Woodſtock.]</hi> The ſaid Mr. <hi>Thomas Fiſh</hi> was educated at <hi>Cambridge-College,</hi> —took his degree, A. B. July <hi>1719;</hi> and juſt before his death was publiſhed to Mrs. <hi>Anne Turner,</hi> of <hi>Scituate,</hi> now the wife of Deacon <hi>Joſeph Stockbridge,</hi> of Pembroke.</p>
                              <p>[This lady was a daughter of Col. Amos Turner, of Scituate. The God of Nature bleſſed her with a capacious mind, which ſhe greatly improved by reading the beſt writers the age ſhe lived in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded; and by converſing with perſons of the beſt taſte in the circle in which ſhe lived; eſpecially the clergy who were moſt noted for their accompliſhments. She rendered her huſband one of the happieſt of men, by her moſt ſweet and engaging behaviour. The want of children was ſupplied by her moſt ſoft and endearing deportment. And though ſhe had no children, ſhe trained up thoſe of others in ſuch a manner, that they were ready to riſe up and call her bleſſed.</p>
                              <p>She lived to an advanced age; and died in her <hi>84</hi>th year, in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, <hi>1782.</hi> She left the world as became a diſciple of Jeſus, though ſhe left it with the moſt excruciating pains, as ſhe died with a cancer in her breaſt: yet ſhe did not reckon the ſufferings of the preſent time worthy to be compared with the glories which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in her. How did ſhe converſe with a moſt intimate friend, who ſaw her but a few days before her death? Thoſe who were not acquainted with her, knew not the happineſs they loſt; and thoſe that were, were ready to cry out in the language of a divine writer, Bleſſed are the dead who die in the Lord: henceforth they reſt from their labours, and their works follow them.—And though ſhe is dead, the life which ſhe lived ſpeaks to all. And may theſe lines recommend religion to her ſex; and then ſhe did not live in vain with reſpect to them, as ſhe did not I truſt with reſpect to herſelf.</p>
                              <p>But I ſhall add no more with reſpect to this once amiable lady—but that the leading ſtrokes in the character of Madam Page, towards the cloſe of this pamphlet, were applicable to her; and that ſhe may be viewed in as amiable a light by the reader. The three ladies, whoſe characters have been attempted in ſome meaſure in theſe pages, ought ever to ſhine in this hemiſphere, like three brilliant ſtars.]</p>
                              <p>He was univerſally beloved for his ſtrict virtue, amiable endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and engaging behaviour—moſt dear to his parents, who mourned not alone.</p>

            <p>Having buried her <hi>father,</hi> in <hi>April,</hi> 1736, which gave her deep ſorrow of heart, ſhe had the trial of parting with her <hi>mother,</hi> in —, 1737.

and oftentimes even helpleſs ſtate, being unable to miniſter to herſelf, her chief dependence was upon her <hi>mother</hi>; who was unwearied in doing for her, every thing that might relieve and comfort her. But now the creature fails—her earthly props are gone,—<hi>father</hi> and <hi>mother forſake her</hi>; and there is none among crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, like minded, to take her up! Now, if no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er refuge opens to view, than what the earth and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures afford ſhe muſt be even inconſolable.—How ſhe ſhould be provided for, ſupported; and enabled to perform the remaining ſtages of life? were queſtions naturally ariſing, but not eaſily anſwered; until the Lord appeared to relieve her troubled mind, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the <hi>fountain</hi> remained, tho' the <hi>ſtreams</hi> were dried up. This conſolation was not entirely withheld from her, though ſhe had not, ſpeedily, the ſenſible benefit of it.</p>
            <p>Under all the dark diſpenſations of Providence, imply'd and referred to, in the foregoing <hi>letters</hi> and account, ſhe remained very much in the dark, as to her ſpiritual ſtate.—Though the ſpirit and ſentiments of her <hi>writings,</hi> accompanied with a <hi>life</hi> agreeable to the Goſpel, might afford ſufficient ground of charity to <hi>others,</hi> that the <hi>grace of God</hi> was with her, yet ſhe had very little charity for <hi>herſelf</hi>; at leaſt had not the comfort of knowing that God was <hi>hers,</hi> and that all theſe things were tokens of his love and faithfulneſs.—</p>
            <p>But in the midſt of darkneſs and trying afflictions; not late in life, while yet in a ſingle ſtate, ſhe was, hopefully, led, more fully and clearly, to view and adore the hand that rules the world, and humbly to acquieſce in all his dealings with her.—She roſe in ſome good meaſure, above the frowns and flatteries of human life,—made the Lord her refuge,—his holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion her buſineſs, and converſing with him her chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt joy.</p>

her eſteem, with whom ſhe delighted to converſe upon the affairs of religion and the other world. Yet ever ſociable and pleaſant, delighting to make <hi>all</hi> about her happy.—Even on a bed of ſickneſs and pain, which affected the hearts of her friends, ſhe would conceal a meaſure of her own grief, and ſtrive to chear their ſpirits, rather than increaſe their ſorrows by uttering all her complaints. Her common treatment of thoſe that viſited her houſe, or fell in her way, (not excepting the injurious) diſcovered a heart full of friendſhip and loving kindneſs to all men.

                  <p>When the time came that ſhe muſt die, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive that it was her laſt ſickneſs, ſhe ſeemed not terrified at the approach of death.—She that had long been deprived of health, and e'en cut off (in youth) from the hopes of that bleſſing.—She "that often received the ſentence of death in herſelf, and viewed

She was religious without the leaſt tincture of <hi>enthuſiaſm</hi> or <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> and never thought religion conſiſted in <hi>grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mace.</hi> Her invention was ſprightly, her wit ready, and of the keeneſt and moſt brilliant kind—her temper firm and agreeable—her judgment ſound beyond what was common to her ſex. She had a mind formed for friendſhip, and was capable of giving counſel and advice. She deſpiſed all low cunning, <hi>in which ſome little creatures pride themſelves.</hi> She never ſaid one thing, when ſhe meant another, which rendered her a moſt endearing friend; <hi>and would never forſake her friend in the day of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity;</hi>

and nothing but the baſeſt ingratitude could wean her affections, where ſhe had once placed them, though ſome beaſts in human ſhape may be ſo baſe ſometimes as to give occaſion for it, eſpecially if they are of the crocodile kind.

            <p>Her liberality if not boundleſs, was moſt extenſive. The poor and needy were her care, and the diſtreſſed of every kind. Of this, ſhe has left a witneſs in the breaſts of hundreds if not thouſands.

When I ſee ſome little flirts, how great the contraſt! Yet I adore (it is not meant with divine worſhip) a female mind that is great, though it be contained within a little caſket.</p>
            <p>How uncommon ſoever the above character may appear in any age, eſpecially in the preſent one, it is not exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, verbum ſacerdotis.<note n="*" place="bottom">

In drawing this imper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect character, care was taken to prevent adulation, which ever leſſens the credence of real worth. For the truth of the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, an appeal is made to the ſenſible part of her acquaintance.— When this character was once read to a clergyman's lady, ſhe replied with an air, which diſcovered ſhe thought it exceeded due bounds. The reverend divine, her huſband, told her he knew the woman while ſhe lived, and it was a juſt character: And if ſo, it muſt have been drawn from the life.

                  <l>Which riſe to heav'n, and put out all the ſtars.</l>

<q>
                  <l>The ways of Heaven are dark and intricate.</l>
                  <l>Puzzled in mazes, and perplex'd with errors,</l>

                  <l>Nor ſees with how much art the windings run,</l>
                  <l>Nor where the regular confuſion ends.</l>

            </p>
            <p>N. B. Shall not the character of ſo amiable a perſon be ſpread as far as pen and types can do it, through the American States? Ye brethren of the type, waft her name down to poſterity; and by doing of it, you will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalize your own, as ſome of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> poets have done by celebrating their goddeſſes. The name of an <hi>Abigail,</hi> a <hi>Judith,</hi> and a <hi>Dorcas,</hi> or a <hi>Tabitha,</hi> with many others, muſt go to make up her character.—But I ſhall add no more, leſt it ſhould be ſuſpected, though I fall ſhort, that I grow wanton in her praiſe.</p>
            <p>The female reader is deſired, before ſhe gives the pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let a ſecond reading, to impreſs her mind with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lines, that ſhe may make the characters her own; and then it will be ſeen ſhe did not read in vain:

                  <l>Stir not a pulſe; and let my blood,</l>

            <p>The Editor wiſhes his pains may not be loſt; but that the young ladies' minds of the preſent age, may be ſo warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch bright examples, that they may ſhine through life like the morning and the evening ſtar in her courſes. How glorious then will they appear, when the beauties of their minds may be viewed without a teleſcope. Then, ſhould they ſet in our hemiſphere in early life, they will riſe in a brighter, and ſhine like the famed Narciſſa who expired in Newhampſhire the laſt ſpring, and left her Philemon and the world to lament their loſs.</p>
