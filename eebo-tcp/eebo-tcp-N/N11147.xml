            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>BEING aſſembled in the houſe of worſhip, which is erected on the ruins of pagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, and <hi>where ſatan's ſeat once was</hi>; to commemorate the arrival of our illuſtrious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, under the auſpices of Heaven, to this new world; and to improve an event aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its riſe, and progreſs, and in every grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and circumſtance, wearing the ſignatures of the divine care and providence, for the purpoſe of raiſing in our breaſts ſentiments of piety and gratitude towards God; the two paſſages of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred writ now read, though of a diſſimilar na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and aſpect, may not be unſuitably choſen for the foundation of our deſign.</p>
            <p>MY reverend brethren, who have gone before me on this occaſion, having refreſhed your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory with ſeveral hiſtoric facts, relative to the removal of our fore-fathers, through great impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014118_0005_0F92FFB5A956A440"/>
and hazard, by means of the mercileſs rage, and cruelty of their perſecutors, from England, to Holland; their firſt ſettlement at Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam; afterwards at Leyden, and their return to England, with reſolutions, by the will of God, to purſue their voyage, with all convenient ſpeed, over the Atlantic, to the uncultivated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of America; and their landing on theſe diſtant and then ſavage ſhores, in a cold and inclement ſeaſon; actuated by the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that at firſt induced them to abandon their fair inheritance in their own country, and ſeek an aſylum from the illiberal perſecuting ſpirit of their fellow citizens, in the more peaceful climes of a neighbouring ſtate.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not therefore riſque the cenſure of this grave and intelligent audience, if I excuſe my ſelf from the repetition of ſuch intereſting particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and invite their attention to that part of the inſpired word propoſed for our preſent conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; which, however, I truſt, will lead us to employ our minds in ſentiments not altogether foreign from the intention of this anniverſary.</p>
            <p>The firſt paſſage, in accommodation to human conception and practice, repreſents the ſupreme Being, as reviewing his works, after they were finiſhed; and being ſatisfied when he ſaw his plan compleated; and that every thing He had made, every claſs and order of beings, and each indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, in regard to the diverſity of their rank, power, propenſity and purſuits, perfectly correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponded to the original model formed in his own mind. <hi>God ſaw every thing that He had made, and behold it was very good,</hi> framed according to his purpoſe, and endued with every capacity, and quality, to anſwer the end of it's creation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:014118_0006_0F92FFB6760335A0"/>Among the works of God, man holds a place of diſtinguſhed rank, and dignity; being made in the divine Image, and inveſted with dominion and ſuperiority over the reſt of the creatures.
<q>The change of phraſe, and the manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion uſed, at the formation of man, it has been obſerved, denotes that he is the chief, and moſt perfect of the works of God, in this lower world.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is beſide our deſign to enquire particularly, what is intended by the Image of God, in which man was at firſt created; about which divines have held ſome different opinions: But as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imply leſs than pre-eminence of nature, and vaſtly ſuperior endowments both of body and mind, as well as dominion, above any of thoſe works which God pronounced very good; we ſhall diſmiſs the conſideration of other natures, and confine our attention to his.</p>
            <p>As God deſigned ſuch a creature as man ſhould exiſt at the head, and as Lord of this world; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving prepared the way, and provided for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular exerciſe and entertainment, by the previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous formation of the earth, and the great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of things both of the animal and vegetable kind that repleniſh and adorn it; his almighty fiat ſpake him into being.</p>
            <p>In his exalted ſtation, he was happy in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and approbation of his Creator, the ſuperior principle of reaſon, and moral ſenſe with which he was endowed, rendered him capable of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the duties of it; and behaving with that propriety, and dignity, as ſhould redound to the divine glory, and his own progreſs, and advantage.</p>
            <p>He had a capacity to improve in natural and moral ſcience, and perfection; his appetites and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014118_0007_0F92FFB71C800158"/>
paſſions were controulable by the ſuperior prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of his nature, and his propenſities carried him into acts of love, gratitude and obedience towards God. By obſerving the law of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and thoſe poſitive precepts which perfect wiſdom ſaw fit to ſubjoin, he was able to make high advances in moral rectitude and happineſs, and continue in the ſmiles and benediction of his maker.</p>
            <p>He was a moral agent, endowed as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly expreſſed, with freedom of will, or a ſelf-determining power, in regard to ſuch volitions and actions as form the moral character, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a likeneſs to the divine purity, or the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>Liberty was an eſſential principle of his conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, a natural quality, and a neceſſary ſpring, and incentive to all virtuous improvement.</p>
            <p>His right to uſe the things provided for the ſupply of his neceſſities, or convenience, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the divine grant, either explicitly made, or diſcovered by the light of his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; ſubject to no reſtraint, but the law of his nature, which was not only conſiſtent with, but the perfection of Liberty; obligation to obey the laws of the Creator, being only a check to licentiouſneſs, and <hi>abuſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He could not reaſonably deſire any change in his ſtate, or any of his circumſtances, but what his progreſs in holineſs, and in the ſeveral pious, and ſocial affections, would to the advantage of his felicity, neceſſarily produce.</p>
            <p>Had he perſevered in his natural rectitude, and attachment to God, and obedience to his laws, of which he was made capable; and poſterity deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from him in his own likeneſs; angry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014118_0008_0F92FFBAB2EF6208"/>
oppreſſion, and cruelty which now take place, and are the ſources of ſo much havock and miſery to the human race, would not have been known in the world.</p>
            <p>Government of ſome ſort, adapted to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature and circumſtances, would indeed, probably, have been inſtituted among them, as from many paſſages of ſcripture we have reaſon to think it is among the Angels themſelves; but there would have been no ſuch laws as are made for the lawleſs and diſobedient, for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and for ſinners.</p>
            <p>It is perhaps, neceſſary to the order and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of all created intelligences, whoſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding muſt be limited, to have government among them; though we need not enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in regard to created ſpirits, who have no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily wants to ſupply, it ought to be diſtinct from, or more poſitive, than the original laws of their nature?</p>
            <p>To ſuch beings, however, it ſeems neceſſary it ſhould, who require bodily ſupport and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, and who from their ſituation, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are capable of acquiring diſtinct and private property. This would have been the caſe with man, had he continued innocent, and become numerous, as it now is in his fallen and depraved ſtate.</p>
            <p>Diſputes might and probably would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ariſe, in regard to perſonal rights and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; not, indeed, as now from the depravity of our affections, but meerly from the imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of knowledge; which muſt be ſettled by ſome known rules, or laws eſtabliſhed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the whole: otherwiſe property would in
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014118_0009_0F92FFBCE30DA9D0"/>
ſome inſtances, remain precarious, and undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
            <p>As there would however, be no evil inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or deſign in any individual, or ſuſpicion of it in others, to invade the property, retain the rights, or check the liberty of any; and as theſe diſputes would take place in conſequence only of thoſe errors of the memory, miſapprehenſion and miſtake to which the human mind, from its natural imbecility, tho' innocent, muſt be liable; they would always be iſſued in the moſt amicable manner, and to the entire ſatisfaction of the parties; and every one left to the free exerciſe of the gifts of nature, and the unmoleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted enjoyment of the bounties of providence.</p>
            <p>Making daily progreſs in natural and moral perfection, dignity and happineſs; of which in this ſtate of things, mankind could not fail, they would proportionably fulfil, and always be fulfilling the wiſe and good end of their Creation.</p>
            <p>With great propriety, therefore, might God on the review of the make of man, finding how admirably he was qualified to anſwer ſuch a purpoſe, and to live in perpetual freedom and happineſs, be repreſented ſaying, as in our text, <hi>Behold it is very good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such was the primitive ſtate of man—happy in the divine image and favor, and in the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and freedom of his own faculties.</p>
            <p>But alas! how changed! what a reverſe of things did he undergo at the fall! when he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated the law of his maker, given for the tryal of his fidelity and obedience, and commenced rebel againſt God, what <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> did he make of the divine preſence, and favour! what a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014118_0010_0F92FFBD26E10890"/>
nature! What irregular propenſities! What ſtrong untoward and eccentric appetites and paſſions were introduced into his conſtitution! and how by one man's diſobedience were many made ſinners, and brought under the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the righteous law of God!</p>
            <p>Mankind, however, though fallen into a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and perverted ſtate, were not ſuffered to periſh in conſequence of the one tranſgreſſion; but the fore-ordained grace of God counteracted the effects of it, by bringing forward a new, and happy diſpenſation, founded on the obedience and righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>What marvellous deſigns of wiſdom, and love had God our heavenly Father, in view, for a loſt world! and how ought our hearts to be comforted, being knit together in love, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all riches of the full aſſurance of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to the acknowledgement of the myſtery of God, and of the Father and of Chriſt!</p>
            <p>The rational faculties of the human mind, though ſadly darkened, and indiſpoſed to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and religious performances, were not deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyed; the paſſions, though depraved, were not eradicated: In every idea of the ſoul, but its primitive purity and rectitude, there remained the eſſential properties of humanity; particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the love of Liberty; which is an original paſſion, not meerly innocent, but requiſite both before and ſince the fall, to all virtuous exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and happy enjoyments, though now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely liable to abuſe by ourſelves, and reſtraint from our fellowmen.</p>
            <p>In whatever view the principle of Liberty be conſidered, or by whatever name diſtinguiſhed,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014118_0011_0F92FFBE709410D0"/>
whether by natural or moral, Civil or religious Liberty; it has its riſe from nature; and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be the will of God that mankind ſhould poſſeſs it, in each of theſe ſenſes.</p>
            <p>Civil liberty is indeed, immediately derived from human compact, and founded on civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but it more properly, though remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, proceeds from nature, as it is the voice of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that men, for the greater ſecurity of their perſons and property, and the promotion of their happineſs, ſhould form into ſociety, and eſtabliſh government among them.</p>
            <p>Conſidering men as being already ſo formed, I ſhall hereafter ſpeak of liberty chiefly as it relates to their civil and religious affairs; though it will be difficult to diſcourſe without ſometimes blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the other ſenſes with it; which I ſhall not be very eareful to avoid.</p>
            <p>The beneficial improvement both of our civil and religious rights depends on liberty.</p>
            <p>Matters that pertain to conſcience, and the worſhip and ſervice of God, and the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Souls for another world, are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of religious liberty; and thoſe things that relate to our preſent ſecurity and happineſs in civil government, are the objects of civil liberty.</p>
            <p>In this manner civil and religious liberty, are uſually diſtinguiſhed; but as there is a connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between thoſe bleſſings which tend to our preſent happineſs, in civil government, and thoſe, which are neceſſary to lay the foundation of that which is future and eternal, and as conſcience is really concerned in both; and men can no more, without offending God, and violating the laws of ſociety, reſign, or neglect the former, than
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014118_0012_0F92FFBEC6CDC688"/>
the latter; theſe two ſenſes of liberty ſeem ſo far to intermix, and in a ſort become one.</p>
            <p>The human mind is ſo framed by its wiſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, as to be greatly ſuſceptive of diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous impreſſions in regard to its moral ſtate and acts of worſhip, from the reſtraints of our civil li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which muſt be allowed to be an undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able argument that ſuch reſtraints are contrary to the will of God.</p>
            <p>Of this the royal Pſalmiſt was deeply ſenſible, and it gave riſe to his prayer, contained in the other paſſage which has been read.—<hi>Deliver me from the oppreſſion of man, ſo will I keep thy precepts</hi>—</p>
            <p>This is an experimental declaration of one who was diſpoſed to worſhip God and keep his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, of the extream difficulty of doing ſo, to any conſiderable advantage, while deprived of civil liberty, and oppreſſed, and borne down, by the ſuperior force and cruelty of lawleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors.</p>
            <p>The caſe of our venerable New-England fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, who ſuffered ſo much at home, in the reign of James the firſt, was in many reſpects ſimilar to this, and an exemplification of the truth of it. Things did not paſs well with them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in church or ſtate; they were treated with rigour, and denied the liberty of the Goſpel, and the enjoyment of the ordinances of God in their purity, by laws and mandates from both.</p>
            <p>Mr. Robinſon's church in particular, the ſeed whence this church grew, and many others have ſince branched, "was extremely harraſſed; ſome caſt into priſon, ſome beſet in their houſes, and ſome forced to leave their farms, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies", as has been witneſſed by one, who was no
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014118_0013_0F92FFBF6626AD88"/>
ſmall ſharer in their ſufferings, both in old Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and New.</p>
            <p>And to their pious zeal, love of liberty, and magnanimity is it chiefly owing, under the ſmiles and guidance of providence, that the wilds of America are now ſo immenſely occupied by ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized and chriſtian inhabitants.</p>
            <p>The royal Pſalmiſt had before prayed, in the verſe preceeding our text, againſt all inward hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance of duty and obedience; ſuch as aroſe from evil inclination, and corrupt affections,— Order my ſteps in thy word, ſays he, and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.</p>
            <p>But ſenſible of another, and common tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to tranſgreſſion, and the neglect of God, he prays againſt this alſo in the text,—<hi>Deliver me from the oppreſſion of man; ſo will I keep thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This he conſiders as a great outward impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the way of his duty; but at the ſame time he was ſo well perſwaded of the diſpoſition of his own heart, as to think if it was but remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and he was delivered out of the hands of them that oppreſſed him, he ſhould go on in an even chearful courſe of obedience to the precepts of God; though under his preſent circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from the reſtraint of his liberty, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to do it, according to his mind and conſcience.</p>
            <p>If we take into conſideration the effects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by oppreſſion in the human mind,—the evil conſequences of it to ſociety, and the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of happineſs it occaſions to individuals; or conſult the ſacred oracles, and the ſeveral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of God towards mankind; we ſhall
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014118_0014_0F92FFC0378C94C0"/>
find that it has been his deſign all along, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance oppreſſion in its various forms, and encourage and promote liberty in the world.</p>
            <p>From our natural notions of the divine cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, beſides what we are taught by revelation, it may be argued, that the communication of happineſs, in co-incidence with his own glory, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the great end propoſed by God in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man.</p>
            <p>He deſigned we ſhould be happy in both worlds; and accordingly by our internal frame and furniture, and outward enjoyments, we are provided with all the materials that are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for this purpoſe; we are conſtituted with liberty, as well to exerciſe and improve our ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional faculties, as to make uſe of the bleſſings and liberalities of providence.</p>
            <p>By the principle of liberty, which is the ſpring and animation of our rational exertions, we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our ſupremacy among the creatures of this lower world, which otherwiſe would annoy us; and by it we taſte the ſweets of the good things of life, and improve in piety and virtue, in divine and ſocial affections, in natural and moral ſcience, and in all thoſe arts and accompliſhments, which perfect and adorn human nature, and make men happy.</p>
            <p>It is, however, ſubject to great impediment and diminution, from various cauſes, but from none more, except our own luſts, than the oppreſſions of our fellowmen.</p>
            <p>Though the devil is the grand tyrant of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, yet if we reſiſt him, he will flee from us; but the oppreſſion of man may be ſo eſtabliſhed, and triumphant, as to admit no hope, either of overcoming it by our own strength, or eſcaping out of its hands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:014118_0015_0F92FFC0F58B7D30"/>And when this is the caſe, it produceth the worſt effects in the human mind. It breaks its force, enervates and obſcures its faculties, cramps the ſpirits, deſtroys emulation, and ſnaps the ſinews of every exalted and virtuous deſign.</p>
            <p>The tempers, and diſpoſitions of men are ſtrangely vitiated and changed by oppreſſion. The brave and enterpriſing grow irreſolute and ſpiritleſs—the ſocial and human, turn ſullen, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling and vicious—the wicked paſs on to high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degrees of enormity, and the righteous decay; obſtructed in their courſe of obedience, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come heartleſs and unimproving.</p>
            <p>The bleſſings of life—the means of natural, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and moral improvements— the peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of ſociety, and the proſpects of future happineſs, are greatly diſturbed and diminiſhed by it. And when it is carried to its extream, and begets confirmed ſlavery, like ſoil prepared to invigorate its proper ſeed, it is productive of many ſpecies of vice: Falſhoods, thefts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance grow out of it; which is a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive proof that the benevolent Creator never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the human nature for oppreſſion, or origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally deſigned it ſhould be ſubject to it.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, it is introduced at the door of ſin; and is, at once, promoted by the general depravity, and promotive of it.</p>
            <p>Whereas liberty is innate, and original; the plant of our heavenly Father; liable indeed, like other original principles to neglect or abuſe from ourſelves and others; but under proper nurture and guidance, capable of accompliſhing noble and beneficent purpoſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:014118_0016_0F92FFC1A4ADC540"/>Poſſeſſed of it, men are, in a moral ſenſe, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the divine agency, capable of perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of being actuated by motives, and by thoſe influences from on high, which are adapted to their make and circumſtances; and of being led to acquire, and ſupport the character of religion and virtue.</p>
            <p>They may be animated by it, to the nobleſt purſuits and higheſt attainments; to grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; to ſecure their beſt intereſt here, and to cultivate in their ſouls thoſe diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and graces, which lay the foundation of future happineſs.</p>
            <p>But deprived of liberty, oppreſſed, and enſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, men not only ſink below the primitive ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of humanity; but even that which has been erected in conſequence of the original tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. They become ſtupid, and debaſed in ſpirit, indolent and groveling, indifferent to all valuable improvement, and hardly capable of any.</p>
            <p>How much then does it concern mankind to preſerve, and cheriſh the ſpirit of liberty!—it is their crown and diadem; and eſſential to human happineſs.</p>
            <p>May the body of the people in theſe colonies, in imitation of our renowned fore-fathers, thoſe free born ſpirits, thoſe brave chriſtian Heroes, who in the true ſpirit of liberty, and for the ſake of worſhipping God according to conſcience, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook their native ſhores, and fled from the iron hand of oppreſſion, to the remote and dark regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of America, be always ready to adopt every ſelf-denying meaſure, and call forth every magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous exertion, that may be found neceſſary, to extricate themſelves, from their preſent poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014118_0017_0F92FFC26B6C8BF0"/>
evils, and continue the enjoyment of the bleſſing of liberty, in this new world.</p>
            <p>And may we all have wiſdom to improve it, for the advantageous purpoſes it is calculated to accompliſh, in the diligent and faithful ſtudy of the holy Scriptures, and in cultivating the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal temper of piety and humanity; hereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging the foundation, both of our preſent and future happineſs: For ſo is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to ſilence the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of fooliſh men; as free, and not uſing your liberty for a cloke of maliciouſneſs, but as the ſervants of God.</p>
            <p>Liberty is the grand preſervative of public ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and incentive to private virtue. How far ſoever the ſpirit of liberty has been, and ſtill is cruſhed and borne down by mighty tyrants, the nimrods of the earth, it is happy for mankind that ſome of it yet remaineth in the world.</p>
            <p>To this invigorating principle, are chiefly to be attributed thoſe high advances in natural and moral philoſophy, and thoſe uſeful diſcoveries in civil and common life, which go far towards im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and embelliſhing human nature.</p>
            <p>"If, ſays a fine writer, elegance comes ſhort of the juſt ſtandard, and is not yet arrived at its proper maturity, human life muſt neceſſarily be deprived of the enjoyment of many convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, of which it is capable, and the manners of mankind muſt incline towards fierceneſs and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition. If carried no farther than the juſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, it produces a more commodious method of living, gives riſe to the invention of many true refinements, heightens the ſplendor and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of ſociety, tends to render mankind ſocial and humane, begets mildneſs and moderation in
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014118_0018_0F92FFC32FB86670"/>
the tempers and actions of men, and helps to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ignorance and ſuperſtition out of the world; and thus far it contributes to the perfection of human ſociety".</p>
            <p>Liberty is requiſite to the growth of every good ſeed in a commonwealth.</p>
            <p>While men are free they have ſuitable encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and ſpirit to improve in the arts of commerce and government, as well as thoſe of common life—they inveſtigate new arts, and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate the old—they contrive methods of juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement—they ſtudy how errors may be rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and defects ſupplied, and how things of real uſe may be perfected, and rendered more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent—they go the round of their daily occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with alacrity, and review their enjoyments with pleaſure, and thus enterprize great ſchemes for the good of ſociety.</p>
            <p>Far from confining their views to their own times, and the emoluments of the preſent age, or the narrow circle of a few in any, they extend them to future periods, and lay foundations of improvement and magnificence for generations yet unborn.</p>
            <p>Animated by the ſpirit of liberty, men are led to attempt great things, in the day of ſmall things; and according to their limited and very imperfect capacity and manner, to imitate the works of God himſelf; to whom a thouſand years are as one day, "Who has an immenſely large, progreſſive ſcheme, conſiſting of many under parts, and intermediate ſteps; all placed in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per periods, and each riſing upon the paſt, and the whole conducted in that regular gentle manner, which is beſt ſuited to the moral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a world of intelligent <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014118_0019_0F92FFC3EFAAF120"/>
moſt becoming a Being of infinite wiſdom, and goodneſs".</p>
            <p>From ſuch hints, which will probably be more largely conſidered by ſome ſucceſſor, may be juſtly argued, that God made man to be free; and that in proportion as they have loſt their liberty in any true ſenſe, the benevolent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of the creator have ſome how, been impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and injuriouſly counteracted in the world.</p>
            <p>We ſhall come to the ſame concluſion if we examine the accounts of the holy ſcriptures: It is manifeſt from the dealings of God with mankind, recorded in them, that he has from the beginning, had a regard for liberty, and that tyrants, and oppreſſors, have been the objects of his abhorrence.</p>
            <p>Oppreſſion and tyranny began to work in early ages, in the perſon and family of Cain, and ſpread abroad its baneful influence, and pernicious effects among men; and when at length, by the unlawful mixtures of <hi>Seth's</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily with his elder brothers, the whole world became corrupt; and injuſtice, tyranny, and oppreſſion prevailed; God manifeſted his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt thoſe giants in wickedneſs, by invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the whole human race, eight perſons excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in one common ruin.</p>
            <p>The miraculous deliverance of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the Egyptian Bondage, is a very ſignal inſtance of God's appearing in favour of liberty, and frowning on tyrants; and it ſhews how much he regards the rights of his people, and in how exemplary a manner, hard hearted tyrants, and mercileſs oppreſſors, ſometimes feel his vengeance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:014118_0020_0F92FFC4B5631570"/>He had pity on his people, toiling in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and for the benefit of ſtrangers, and groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the unreaſonable weight of their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; and he came down and ſet them free.</p>
            <p>It ought not to be forgotten, that this was done, at a time, and in a manner peculiarly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated and intended, to be a terror and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the remoteſt nations, and all future op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors.</p>
            <p>In what ſtrains of paternal tenderneſs, on the one hand, and indignation on the other, is the divine Being repreſented as ſpeaking, on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion? I have ſurely ſeen the affliction of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which are in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and have heard their cry, by reaſon of their taſk-maſters; for I know their ſorrows, and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians.</p>
            <p>The ſame thing is further confirmed by the nature of the civil government of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After they had been delivered out of the houſe of bondage, God ſaw ſit to inſtitute a certain form of mixed government among them, under which they were to be reſtored to the knowledge and practice of true religion, and the poſſeſſion of their natural rights and liberties. This form was propoſed to the conſideration of the people, and they gave their full conſent to it, and it was in all reſpects a free government.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of liberty breathed in every part, and was ſupported, defended, and promoted, by its whole conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Wiſe laws were enacted for the preſervation of Liberty, and the adminiſtration of Juſtice through the whole nation, and "as their lands were to deſcend to their poſterity, and were a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

            <p>From expreſs prohibitions of oppreſſion, and of the ſale of any Iſraelite for a bondman; from the releaſe of debtors, the reſtoration of lands to their original owners, the general freedom of ſervants on ſabbatical years, and times of rejoice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing celebrated among the Jews, in commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their deliverance out of Egypt, for all which things, particular ſtatutes were ordained; we may ſee how admirably their government was calculated to keep alive a ſpirit of liberty, and inſpire them with the love of it.</p>
            <p>At the time of their withdraw from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Jehovah, when they unwiſely and ungratefully deſired a change in their political ſtate, and to come under the power of earthly Kings, God did not forſake them; but on the contrary, manifeſted his concern for their welfare, and let them know how far, and in what reſpects, if they proceeded, they would be likely to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their liberties, by ordering a deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the manner of their King to be laid before them: He will take your ſons and appoint them for himſelf; for his chariots, and to be his horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and ſome ſhall run before his chariots— and he will appoint him captains over thouſands, and captain over fifties, and will ſet them to ea<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> his ground, and to reap his harveſt, and to make his inſtruments of war, and inſtruments of his chariots; and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers— and he will take your fields, and your vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and your olive yards, even the beſt of them,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014118_0022_0F92FFC700C83DB8"/>
and give them to his ſervants; and he will take the tenth of your ſeed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers and to his ſervants, and he will take your men ſervants, and your maid ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and your goodlieſt young men, and your aſſes, and put them to his work, he will take the tenth of your ſheep, and ye ſhall be his ſervants.</p>
            <p>This is not a deſcription of what their Kings would have any right or juſt authority to do; but of what their practice would be; if, as they requeſted, they had a King like the other nations; unmindful of the common good, the only end of civil authority, they would treat their ſubjects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly, and make uſe of them and of their wealth for their own aggrandiſement and evil deſign, diveſting them of that liberty, which they ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily enjoyed, under their former government.</p>
            <p>The evident traces of the ſpirit of liberty, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable in the writings of the ſucceeding Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and running through them; the frequent denunciations of the divine judgments againſt ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and oppreſſors, the names and images by which they characteriſe them, their predictions of their final overthrow, and of a time approaching before the end of the world, when righteouſneſs and peace, truth and liberty, and happineſs ſhall prevail, are other undeniable proofs of God's care to uphold the cauſe of liberty, and his purpoſe to render it finally triumphant over all the tyrants of the earth; thoſe beaſts and dragons, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets call them, that is, deceivers and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of mankind.</p>
            <p>The ancient Prophets were endowed with plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful meaſures of the ſpirit of liberty; their breaſts glowed with the ſacred flame, and they had a juſt ſenſe of its neceſſity to promote improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both in a civil and religious view. Far from
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014118_0023_0F92FF4A8E1FE3F8"/>
thinking it a proſtitution of their ſacred office, they on the contrary, conſidered it as part of the duty of it, to give their voice in favour of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſpeak as they often did, in the ſevereſt language, and warmeſt ſtrains of indignant elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence againſt oppreſſive powers and domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tyrants.</p>
            <p>If we will now look into the writings of the new teſtament, we ſhall find that they are friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the cauſe of liberty.</p>
            <p>In the moſt perfect ſenſe of it, intending free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the bondage of ſatan and our own luſts, it was the great object of Chriſt's undertaking; and agreeably He applied to himſelf what had been long before teſtified of Him, by the ſpirit of prophecy—the ſpirit of the Lord is upon me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath anointed me to preach the goſpel to the poor, He hath ſent me to heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering ſight to the blind, to ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed. It is ſaid that the law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, maketh free from the law of ſin and death; and if the Son make us free, we ſhall be free indeed.</p>
            <p>'Tis allowed that when Chriſt was in the world working out the redemption of ſinners, He did not ſay many things concerning civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and poltical liberty: Freedom of a far more important nature employ'd his time and thoughts: and his ſilence in this regard, has been turned into an argument by ſome, that the miniſters of religion depart from the duty of their office, and act out of character, when in any ſtate of our public affairs, they make ſuch matters ſubjects of their diſcourſes from the pulpit, or even in private converſation. But beſides other ſubſtantial things
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014118_0024_0F92FF4B2D7469E0"/>
that might be replied, it ought to be remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Prophets before, and the Apoſtles after him, were not ſo ſparing; and this I think is a ſolid proof, either that his ſilence was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as an example, or that ſome of the inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Apoſtles at leaſt miſunderſtood it.</p>
            <p>There were ſpecial prudential reaſons why Chriſt, 'till He had finiſhed the work of his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and fulfilled every thing in the ſcriptures concerning Him, ſhould avoid ſpeaking with any degree of freedom and openneſs of matters of government and the civil liberties of mankind. "The Jews were continually laying weight for ſomething to accuſe Him of to the Romans, tempting Him, and trying all methods to draw Him into any act, which might be conſtrued treaſon, or diſaffection to their government".</p>
            <p>And conſidering the great wickedneſs of the Jews in that age, and their particular malignity againſt Chriſt, together with the uſurpations and encroachments of ſome of the roman magiſtrates, had He ſaid almoſt any thing of civil rights, they would have charged Him with ſedition and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For ſimilar reaſons, He declined any direct anſwer, when queſtioned about his being the Meſſiah, and ſome other matters; and it is hoped miniſters will not be blamed for treating on the meſſiahſhip of Chriſt, becauſe He himſelf had ſometimes good reaſons to be cautious.</p>
            <p>But though Chriſt did not think proper to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide any thing, as to civil rights in particular caſes; yet from what He ſaid, on ſeveral occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we may learn his ſentiments on the ſubject of liberty, and government in general.</p>
            <p>He not only bore teſtimony againſt ſpiritual tyranny, and the undue claims of power, in the Scribes and Phariſees—He not only intimated his deteſtation ot perſecution, when He adviſed
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014118_0025_0F92FF4BED5EE228"/>
his Apoſtles, to beware of men, and if they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted them in one city to flee to another—He not only implicitly cenſured the tyrannies of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile world, when he ſaid to his diſciples, that the princes of the Gentiles exerciſe dominion over them, but it ſhall not be ſo among you: But he ſpake of Herod King of Galilee, with a degree of ſeverity, when the Phariſees told him, that he would kill him. He alſo expreſsly commanded to render unto Ceſar the things that are Ceſar's, and unto God the things that are God's; the natural ſenſe of which precept is this, that men ſhould give tribute and cuſtom, reſpect and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to thoſe cloathed with lawful authority, as far as they are due, and neceſſary to anſwer the ends of government, but that they are to make no encroachments on the things of God, which are likewiſe to be given to him, things pertaining to his ſervice, appropriated to his worſhip; the rights of conſcience and natural rights and liberties, which are the donations of his goodneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and neceſſary to the preſervation of that peace and order, and juſtice among men, which He hath ordained.</p>
            <p>In this precept much is ſaid in little, relative to civil government; ſuch prudence is diſplayed, as was ſufficient to avoid the ſnare that was laid for Him, and at the ſame time, the moſt perfect ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule is given for the guidance of magiſtrates and people, and rendering ſociety happy.</p>
            <p>Among the apoſtles, St. Paul in his epiſtle to the Romans, hath explicitly ſpoken of civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and pointed out the ends of it, the duty of magiſtrates, and the ground of ſubmiſſion to their authority in the moſt conciſe and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive manner.</p>
            <p>His own conduct, on diverſe occaſions, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the ſenſe he had both of civil and religious
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:014118_0026_0F92FF4CB137F9C0"/>
liberty; it was of a piece with his doctrine, and is the beſt comment upon it.</p>
            <p>There was a remarkable diſplay of the ſpirit of liberty in his behavior, when on a falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and without legal proceſs, he and Silas were, by order of the magiſtrates, beaten and caſt into Priſon, and their feet made faſt in the ſtocks.</p>
            <p>The magiſtrates, terrified by an earthquake, ſent the ſerjeants to releaſe them, but Paul, animated by the ſpirit of liberty, even in a goal, and ſenſible that his rights had been invaded; inſiſted on a practical acknowledgment of it, from the magiſtrates themſelves—Paul ſaid unto them, they have beaten us openly, uncondem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, being Romans, and have caſt us into priſon; and now do they thruſt us out privily? nay veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly!—but let them come themſelves, and fetch us out.</p>
            <p>The ſerjeants reported theſe words to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and they feared when they heard they were Romans. They knew they had injured them by depriving them of liberty, who were as free as themſelves, and had as good a right to the privileges and protection of the roman govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; juſt as the Americans, by nature and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are entitled to the ſame rights and liberties as Britons, or as they themſelves would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, had they been born within the realm of England.</p>
            <p>It is, however, hard for exalted characters, who have been uſed to have their orders executed, to bring themſelves to make conceſſions; but the magiſtrates were overawed by the earthquake, and from other conſiderations alſo, they found unneceſſary to come perſonally, and by entreaties make up the matter—they came and beſought them, and brought them out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:014118_0027_0F92FF4D76B2C308"/>But it may be aſked; why was Paul and his companion ſo obſtinate? why did they not come out when the ſerjeant came with orders to let them go free? Why did they continue in confinement a moment longer than was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? —The keeper of the priſon, it ſeems thought they would readily embrace the offer, and as he had now great reaſon to eſteem them, he ran haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily with the joyful tidings, and wiſhed them peace.</p>
            <p>But they had good reaſon for their conduct; they knew the value of liberty, and its impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to mankind, and they choſe rather to ſuffer the cruelty, and ignominy of a goal, a while lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, than not bear ſufficient teſtimony againſt ſuch magiſtrates as had unjuſtly invaded it.</p>
            <p>Their behaviour in this affair may be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as having reſpect to themſelves and others; as to themſelves, they were ſenſible if they did not improve this opportunity, to induce the magiſtrates who had done the injury to make reparation; other magiſtrates would not be ſo likely to be deterred from a ſimilar practice, nor theſe ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually prevented from repeating the abuſe, and perhaps carrying it to a greater extremity, when the horrors of the earthquake were gone off.— And as to other men, whoſe welfare they were obliged to promote, they knew if they did not bring their oppreſſors to acknowledge the injuſtice they had been guilty of, in denying them the liberties of Romans, they ſhould ſet an example of ill influence to all who might afterwards be oppreſſed, and encourage magiſtrates to go any lengths in this ill treatment of ſubjects. But if they brought them to a practical nullifying of this inſtance of oppreſſion, their example would be likely to be beneficial to mankind in future time, and induce them under ſimilar abuſes to tread in their ſteps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo maintain liberty in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:014118_0028_0F92FF4E20332DE8"/>Paul and Silas therefore, like men acquainted with their own, and the rights of ſociety, acted this noble part, for the promotion and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the cauſe of liberty.</p>
            <p>No man was ever more tender of his liberties, or more deſirous to continue ſuch rich bleſſings in the world than the apoſtle Paul.</p>
            <p>At a time when the chief captain had ordered him to be examined by ſcourging, and they were binding him with thongs for that purpoſe, with what independence of mind did he demand of the centurion,—Is it lawful for you to ſcourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?</p>
            <p>And when the ſame officers on being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his aſſuming the freedom of Rome, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his claim, obſerved that it was with a great ſum he himſelf had obtained this freedom; how did Paul aſſert his own pre-eminence,—but I was free born.</p>
            <p>And afterwards, having fallen into the hands of the high prieſt, who as he was pleading his cauſe, commanded him to be ſmitten on the mouth; with what a manly ſpirit of reſentment did he reply, God ſhall ſmite thee, thou whited wall, for ſitteſt thou to judge me after the law, and commandeſt me to be ſmitten contrary to the law? Soon after, indeed, he recalled the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful language ſtiling the high Prieſt a whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wall, and ſaid he wiſt not that he was the high prieſt, but he never retracted the ſenſe he had of the illegal indignity that was offered him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor his zeal againſt ſuch rulers as contradicted the end of their office.</p>
            <p>When he was brought before Felix at one time, and Feſtus, and King Agrippa at another, he made his defence with the ſame free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepid ſpirit.—He yielded no rights, he reſigned no liberties into the hands of any man, however
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:014118_0029_0F92FF4EF9A57628"/>
cloathed with authority, but he was always ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive to magiſtrates acting in their line, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be governed and judged by the law.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be enquired why theſe inſtances of Paul's conduct relative to civil liberty are handed down to us, ſince it was his chief buſineſs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct men in the great doctrines and duties of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; it may be ſaid, that among other reaſons, which I need not mention, a probable one is, to let us know, the ſenſe he had of the connection between religious and civil liberty, and that the former cannot be expected to exiſt, but upon the baſis of the latter.</p>
            <p>The conduct and diſcourſes of the Apoſtles, whenever they had occaſion to ſpeak of civil li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, were always friendly to its cauſe, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of tyranny and uſurpation; — the great principle which they ever acted from themſelves, and inculcated on others was, that we ought to obey God rather than man.</p>
            <p>Although agreeable to what their Lord had ſaid, they looked on themſelves and all chriſtians, as belonging to a ſociety totally different from ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſtates, ſubjects of a kingdom which is not of this world; yet as the free exerciſe of the external offices of this peculiar kingdom, muſt in ſuch a world as this, and among ſuch inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, greatly depend on the equity, impartiality and freedom of civil government, and as in this reſpect it was more, and in every laudable world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpect, as much the intereſt of chriſtians, as of other men, to live under ſuch a government, they made conſcience as 'tis natural to ſuppoſe they would, of ſpeaking and acting on proper occaſions, in a manner that had a tendency to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to mankind.</p>
            <p>Civil liberty, which itſelf is an object of great moment, is ſometimes ſpoken of by the ſacred
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:014118_0030_0F92FF500AD193B8"/>
penmen, in both teſtaments, for its own ſake; at other times on the account of its ſalutary influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and effects on religious liberty.</p>
            <p>Enough has been ſaid by the ancient Prophets, and by Chriſt and the Apoſtles, to convince us that they had a moſt tender regard for the natural and civil rights of mankind, and an abhorrence of all ſpiritual tyranny and domination.</p>
            <p>Chriſt has told us that the members of his myſtical body, the church, are brethren—there are to be no maſters among them—no authority ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed over the faith or conſciences of any— one is our maſter, even Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle Peter, who was himſelf an elder, hath ſtrictly prohibited the elders of the flock, lording it over God's heritage.</p>
            <p>And whoever are guilty of ſuch uſurpation, though dignified among men, and diſtinguiſhed by the epithets of right reverend, and even his Holineſs, are liable to the reproof adminiſtred by the Prophet to the ancient ſhepherds of Iſrael; wo be to the ſhepherds of Iſrael that do feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; ſhould not the ſhepherds feed the flock? ye eat the fat, and ye cloath you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed; but ye feed not the flock, the diſeaſed have ye not ſtrengthned, neither have ye healed that which was ſick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye bro't again that which was driven away, neither have ye ſought that which was loſt; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.</p>
            <p>At the time St. Paul had occaſion to uſe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeverity, at leaſt with ſome of the Corinthians, he expreſsly diſclaimed dominion over their faith, aſſigning this good reaſon for it, by faith ye ſtand.</p>
            <p>Had we time to conſider more largely the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and genius of the religion of the Bible, its
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:014118_0031_0F92FF507B0A6528"/>
various requirements, and the principles, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and duties it enjoins; the divine regards both to civil and religious liberty, and God's intention to promote it among men, would appear in a ſtrong and irreſiſtable point of light.</p>
            <p>That temper and conduct—that love of God and man, and thoſe divine and ſocial virtues, every where recommended; particularly that imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſt, or correſpondence of heart and life to his example, which are eſſential parts of his religion, are admirably calculated to ſecure the natural and religious rights and liberties of mankind, and put an end to the miſeries of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and tyranny.</p>
            <p>Chriſt not only ſet us an example of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal benevolence, but of the love of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as conſiſtent with it; like a true patriot he had a peculiar concern for the welfare of his own nation, and ſpent his life in the moſt benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent actions among them, and he could not call to mind the calamities he knew they were about to ſuffer in conſequence of their obſtinacy and unbelief, but with the tendereſt emotions of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and grief.</p>
            <p>And ſo far as men partake of his ſpirit, and are actuated by the principles of his religion, be they magiſtrates or ſubjects, they will be led to a behaviour tending to ſupport the general cauſe of liberty, and the particular freedom and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of their own country.</p>
            <p>It was, indeed, the great intention of Chriſt, to introduce men into a ſtate of ſpiritual liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that being made free from ſin, and become ſervants to God, they might have their fruit unto holineſs, and the end everlaſting life; but as his religion is formed to produce this effect, by reinforcing doctrines and principles, that
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:014118_0032_0F92FF512D3A5E80"/>
have a tendency, to ſubdue thoſe luſts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions that enſlave the mind, and to influence men to practiſe thoſe virtues in which the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the ſoul conſiſts; and as the aſſiſtances and co-operations of the divine ſpirit are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to break the yoke of ſatan and replace our ſouls in a ſtate of moral ſtrength and freedom, which is the pureſt and moſt perfect idea and condition of freedom we are capable of; ſo in virtue of the ſame influence and tendency, his religion contributes to the preſervation and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of liberty in civil and religious ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For, in proportion as the minds of individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als are made free from ſin, and the virtues of the Goſpel are practiſed; oppreſſion and tyranny muſt ceaſe, and liberty revive and prevail every where, both in church and ſtate.</p>
            <p>May therefore a deep ſenſe of religion impreſs the minds, and influence the conduct of all men! and thoſe happy times, we are taught to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, come on! when the power of oppreſſion ſhall be baniſhed from the world; and a King ſhall reign and proſper, who ſhall execute judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and juſtice in the earth; and there ſhall be nothing to hurt or deſtroy in all God's holy mountain.</p>
            <p>It only remains that we make a few reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or inferences from what has been diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and conclude with them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, We ſee what reaſon we have to admire and adore the wiſdom and goodneſs of God, in conſtituting a religion for us, which, while it provides for the moral liberty of our ſouls, and our everlaſting happineſs in another world, hath not been unmindful of the rights of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the civil liberties of ſociety, in this.</p>
            <p>Liberty is the ſpirit and genius of the ſacred writings; the great thing aimed at in them, is
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:014118_0033_0F92FF51E33C2C10"/>
to make men free from ſin; to deliver them out of bondage to their luſts, and procure and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the moral freedom of their minds.</p>
            <p>But though this be their main object, yet as liberty in any important ſenſe, civil or religious, is friendly to the cauſe of godlineſs, ſtands in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with it, and has its influence into the ſpiritual freedom of the ſoul; they have taken care by enjoining ſelf government, the generous affections and a righteous behaviour towards men, to provide for this kind of liberty in human ſociety.</p>
            <p>A juſt regard for the authority of the inſpired word, will moſt effectually ſecure and promote it.</p>
            <p>As far as the liberty of mankind has been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, and their rights invaded, and oppreſſion and tyranny have prevailed in any kingdom or nation on earth; ſo far has there been a repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to, and a departure from the true ſpirit of the holy ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>The religion of the Bible hath a regard to our benefit in both worlds, it conſiſts of ſuch principles, duties and virtues, as are adapted to the human nature and circumſtances; it is ſo contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as to deliver us from the vaſſalage of our luſts, and the oppreſſion of man, by the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine energy—it forms our tempers to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of God, and diſpoſes us for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime exerciſes, and refined enjoyments of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom; at the ſame time, and by the ſame means, that it promotes our beſt intereſt, peace and quietneſs on earth—godlineſs hath the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</p>
            <p>This is a conſideration that demands our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt gratitude; and while our hearts are enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and our mouths filled with the praiſes of God for ſo rich and ineſtimable a bleſſing, may
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:014118_0034_0F92FF52A15F6D30"/>
it be our care to devote ourſelves forever to his ſervice; and improve our religious advantages, according to their gracious deſign and tendency, for the promotion both of our preſent and future happineſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly; If religion is eminently productive of liberty, and the ſecurity of it; we are led, from the remarkable diſplay of liberty in the great undertaking of our fore-fathers, to form a favourable judgment of their religion, and to believe it was pure and undefiled, and according to knowledge, in oppoſition to enthuſiastic rant and fanaticiſim. There have been indeed, many inſtances of the love of liberty among a people, whoſe religion has been no other than pagan; and no marvel; it is a natural paſſion, capable however, of being ſtrengthened by religion; and is uſually the ſtrongeſt, where religion is the pureſt and the moſt divine.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the names of our illuſtrious anceſtors have been traduced, and their religion queſtioned, and even vilified by ſome, as the ravings of a diſordered mind, or the effects of ignorance and ſuperſtition, an abuſe which few eſcaped who were diſtinguiſhed by the name of puritans; yet the charitable as well as probable opinion is, that they were men of real piety and godlineſs; and that like David of old, they deſired to get out of the hands of their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, that they might have more liberty to keep God's precepts, and worſhip and ſerve him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the light of their own conſciences.</p>
            <p>I am not ſenſible of any bias, though I would not be too confident, from an undue veneration for antiquity, or for the ſuperior knowledge and diſcernment of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> whom we commonly call the Fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but with reſpect to the fathers of New-England, the more I am acquainted with their hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:014118_0035_0F92FF54D2C2CBA0"/>
and minutely enquire into their religion and morality, and particular behaviour towards the natives of this land, the greater reaſon have I to be perſwaded, that their religion was derived from the fountain of truth, and therefore real and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial.</p>
            <p>It appears to have had the marks of divinity upon it, and to have been founded on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per baſis of all religion—the love of God; and that charity to man, that bond of peace and of all virtues, made a very conſpicuous part of it.</p>
            <p>At the time of our Fathers abandoning their native country, many things were out of order in the ſtate, and they had reaſon to complain of the too arbitrary and undue exerciſe of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of government. But their chief motive in it was religion; freedom of worſhipping God agreeably to the rule of his word, and the dictates of their own minds</p>
            <p>Religion was precious in their eyes; they were willing to leave houſes and lands, and many dear and valuable poſſeſſions, for the ſake of enjoying it in its purity. But they were men, and like other good men they were liable to, and had their failings; its well they had no more.</p>
            <p>When we recollect the cruel treatment they met with from their brethren at home, and their ſufferings abroad; the difficulties and perils of their voyage, and the many hardſhips and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers they encountered after they had arrived, in this ſeaſon of the year, to theſe dark and unfriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhores; their unſhaken fortitude and patient ſuffering of affliction in the cauſe of religion, fill our minds with equal pleaſure and aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>We ought doubtleſs to conſider it, as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the love of God ruling in their hearts, and of his grace abiding with them, and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with the ſtedfaſt hope of good things
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:014118_0036_0F92FF550BD51938"/>
to come; that under ſuch tryals, their ſpirits were not broken, and their tempers ſoured to diſtruſt, peeviſhneſs and vice.</p>
            <p>It may, I believe, be juſtly affirmed, that their devotedneſs to God and his cauſe, their regard for the holy ſcriptures, and love of the truth as it is in Jeſus, their faithfulneſs to themſelves and poſterity, and their aſſiduous care and endeavours to tranſmit their religion uncorrupted, and their liberties unimpaired to remoteſt ages; are to be equalled but by few inſtances, and perhaps ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed by none, ſince the days of inſpiration.</p>
            <p>Their hiſtory, if faithfully recorded, will ſhine with a peculiar luſtre, in the annals of the church, down to its lateſt period in this militant ſtate.</p>
            <p>To us eſpecially, who are entered on their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as our natural inheritance, and who, till of late years, have largely partaken of the happy fruits of their virtuous ſufferings, and many toils, both in church and ſtate; and believe we ſhall again partake of them; their names are juſtly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable: But we intend no more than a decent expreſſion of filial reſpect, when on this anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, we their children, riſe up, and call them bleſſed.</p>
            <p>Their example, however, as far as it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by the love of religion and liberty, and the grace of God that was in them, ought to be regarded by us, and improved for the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect accompliſhing of their great and pious deſigns.</p>
            <p>In this view, we cannot but approve the late conduct of the town of Plymouth, in devoting the anniverſary of our fore-fathers landing here, to a religious uſe, and a grateful recollection of the care of providence, in bringing about ſo memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable an event.</p>
            <p>Much benefit, if I miſtake not, both to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and poſterity, may grow out of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; if it be but obſerved with ſobriety, and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:014118_0037_0F92FF55A0EA8768"/>
temperance, as a civil and religious feſtivity, and not ſuffered to degenerate into carnal mirth, and the works of darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly—We learn that no man in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of any rank or character whatever, can be unintereſted in the cauſe of liberty; or lawfully neglect it; much leſs make uſe of his influence in oppoſing and bearing it down.</p>
            <p>It is a common cauſe, and the right of nature. Every man that is born into the world, as Mr. Lock, that prince of philoſophers hath ſaid, "is born to it," and every member of civil and religious ſociety has an unalienable title to, and concern in it; and is bound by the moſt ſacred and indiſſoluble ties, in a juſt exertion of his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and by every adequate method, to ſpread the love of it among mankind, and defend it, againſt tyrants and oppreſſors.</p>
            <p>This obſervation comes with too ſelf-evident clearneſs, and force, to the reaſon of man, to admit of avowed oppoſition from any, but yet in the political diſputes in which we are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, unhappily involved with our fellow ſubjects at home, there are ſome in the midſt of us, and hard as it may be to believe it, ſuch as are deſcended from our worthy anceſtors, who from a miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the nature and juſt extent of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial office, have pretended to deny it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the clergy in particular; and have uſed ſome feeble and uncouth attempts to wreſt it out of their hands. The conduct however, of the holy Prophets and Apoſtles, the firm and open ſpirit with which they delivered their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, on the ſubject of liberty, and bare teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt lawleſs oppreſſors, though igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly paſſed over by them, will be diſcerned by others, to afford example to the ordinary mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of religion, and authoriſe them, in their
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:014118_0038_0F92FF569E9B6360"/>
public and private addreſſes to uſe their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if any they have, in ſupporting and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing the cauſe of liberty.</p>
            <p>This is not barely a right that may be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed or neglected at pleaſure, but the duty of all ranks of men in ſociety; no one is, or can be, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted. Liberty is the cauſe of all, and all ſhould be ready to ſpend, and be ſpent in its ſervice.</p>
            <p>Political apoſtates, and other paricides will not indeed admit, though they cannot deny ſuch doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; it were to be wiſhed there was no occaſion to ſay that their unexampled behaviour, in this day of anxiety and conteſt, when the rights of all the colonies are the ſtake, is too manifeſtly calculated according to the weight of its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to cut up the liberties of America by the roots, and cool the paſſion, and obſcure the ſenſe of them in the breaſts of their fellow country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. At the ſame time, ſtrange to relate! They fondly aſſume, and by aſſuming prophane the reſpectable characters of loyalty and friends to government! Solicitous to hide from the world, and if poſſible from themſelves, their unhallowed views of ambition and avarice, under the cover of venerable forms, as the grand apoſtate ſpirit himſelf is ſometimes transformed into an angel of light, to accompliſh the baneful deſigns of the kingdom of darkneſs. Notwithſtanding, when they ſhall make their cordial ſubmiſſions to their much injured country, and ſeek reconciliation with it, we may forgive, but it will be a hard thing to forget their crimes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As liberty is the right of nature, confirmed to us by revelation, and eſſential to our happineſs, we ought to be deeply humbled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tokens of the divine reſentments, in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſo great an adverſity to befal us, as that of being obliged to contend for it in oppoſition to
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:014118_0039_0F92FF5A8DD09730"/>
meaſures contrived to deprive us of ſo rich a bleſſing.</p>
            <p>When the righteous providence of God, which in the friendleſs and defenceleſs ſtate of our pious anceſtors, condeſcended to be their ſun and ſhield, the vigilant and almighty guardian of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, families and rights, hath ſeen it neceſſary to correct the growing infidelity, immorality and prophaneneſs of their degenerate offspring, by permitting a thick cloud to gather over our heads, and invelope the American colonies in darkneſs, ſome humiliating reflections ought to intermix with the joy and gratitude of the day.</p>
            <p>We juſtify the ways of providence in all that is come upon us—the Lord hath done right, but we have done wickedly—our ſins have been the procuring moral cauſe of the Judgments we feel, and we ought to be humble before God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and amend our ways and doings; but yet with regard to man, we are greatly injured, we have reaſon to complain, and may juſtly aſſert our rights, and maintain our cauſe againſt them.</p>
            <p>A more grievous misfortune however, could not befal us than this; we deeply lament it! We deprecate a contention with the parent ſtate! It is the burden of America, and under the weight of it we are all ready to enquire with anxious hearts, watchman, what of the night? watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, what of the night? is there any good news from our mother country? any thing to raiſe the hopes of our own? can America en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertain expectations from britiſh juſtice or paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſympathy of a deliverance out of her diſtreſſes.</p>
            <p>In a ſituation ſo gloomy, let us commit our cauſe unto him who judgeſt righteouſly, and lift up our heartt to God in the heavens, in earneſt prayer and ſupplication—truſt in him at all times,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:014118_0040_0F92FF5C8A341750"/>
oh ye people, pour out your hearts before him. Our expectation is from God. He is our ſalvation and our glory, the rock of our ſtrength, and our refuge is in God.</p>
            <p>The great affairs of ſtates and kingdoms, are ſubject to his controul and governance. He chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth times and ſeaſons; the hearts of Kings and of all men are in his hands, and He turneth them as rivers of water are turned. In the midſt of our perplexity and fear, then let us look to God, who is high above all nations, and whoſe glory is above the heavens; and may we all as one man, break off our ſins by repentance, and our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by turning to the Lord; if we will thus pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitently betake ourſelves to him, though He hath ſmitten us, He will bind us up; his going forth is prepared as the morning, and He ſhall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain, unto the earth.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Conſidering that the rights and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the colonies are ſo important bleſſings, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to us from the divine goodneſs, through the hands of our adventurous fore-fathers, it is hoped we ſhall not ſupinely ſuffer them to ſlip out of our poſſeſſion, or be wanting in any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſelf-denial, and other wiſe and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al means, to ſecure them to the preſent, and tranſmit them to future generations.</p>
            <p>The alarm that is gone forth through the land, and the aſſiduous attention given to our public affairs, by all ranks, ages and ſexes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, we cannot but eſteem a token for good, a ſymptom of vital ſtrength, in the body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic, though ſome of its members are mutilated and maimed; nor can we atribute the firm u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and coment of our numerous colonies and the general agreement of their <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of oppoſition, to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:014118_0041_0F92FF5DC4513598"/>
to any principle ſo juſtly, as the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the divine influence on the minds of men.</p>
            <p>Judging from appearances, we have reaſon to hope, and believe, that God himſelf has riſen to work out our ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Let us not provoke him to withdraw the influences of his providence, by our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity and neglect.</p>
            <p>God uſually worketh by means and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in accompliſhing the great purpoſes of his providence among men; we have no reaſon from analogy, to expect a deliverance out of our political evils, by the immediate exertion of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power; we muſt work ourſelves, with a due dependance on the divine energy and bleſſing, and then, from the juſtice of our cauſe, may we expect that God will work with us and in us, and crown our endeavours with ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>The honourable, and much eſteemed Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Continental Congreſs, whom we volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily conſtituted the guardians of our rights, have with great judgment and faithfulneſs, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to a mode of conduct, from which, if religiouſly adhered to by ourſelves, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the divine bleſſing, we may entertain the ſtrongeſt hopes.</p>
            <p>It is at once calculated to procure a radical redreſs of American grievances, and to promote the future peace, harmony and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty both of Great-Britain, and the colonies.—It ſhews that we contend for nothing but our own, that we aim at nothing but our rights, and wiſh and pray for nothing more ardently in this world, than a reconciliation and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing connection with our brethren at home: If it ſucceeds, we are mutually happy; if not, as
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:014118_0042_0F92FF5DFB132370"/>
the wiſeſt ſchemes of men may prove abortive, thro' the corruption and wickedneſs of ſome other, it will at leaſt manifeſt to the whole world, that the demands of America are juſt, and her diſpoſition loyal and pacific.</p>
            <p>And then, when the worſt of events com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to which that reſpectable body have in the mean time adviſed us to extend our views, and be prepared for, we may with firm hope and humble reliance, implore the aids of his providence, who is the almighty avenger of wrongs, with whom is wiſdom and ſtrength, who poureth contempt upon princes, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſtrength of the mighty, who lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth councellors away ſpoiled, and maketh the judges fools.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Upon a retroſpective view of our fore-fathers coming over into this land, the cauſes moving them to it—the pious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns they had in it—the many hardſhips and perils attending it, and the foundation hereby laid for uſeful improvements in the arts of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized life, commerce and literature; but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the knowledge and practice of the chriſtian religion, where ignorance and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm had before prevailed for unknown ages; we ought to be very thankful to almighty God for the peculiar care and guardianſhip of his providence, ſo conſpicuous in every part of this grand enterprize.</p>
            <p>God was with them of a truth, encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and defending them, and carrying them through difficulties and perils in a wonderful manner, which demands our particular atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and grateful acknowledgments this day.</p>
            <p>He had, doubtleſs, great and wiſe purpoſes to ſerve, in leading them into this barbarous and extenſive wilderneſs, which we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:014118_0043_0F92FF5EAB89E790"/>
to believe, are far from having yet been wholly accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable, that in the many threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning dangers that beſet our Fathers in early time, from the wicked machinations of open enemies, or the ſecret plots of treacherous and falſe-hearted friends, and that have ſince, even down to the preſent day, beſet us, God hath always appeared on our ſide, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us out of all our fears and diſtreſſes, and we truſt he will ſtill deliver us.</p>
            <p>Not unto us, oh Lord, not unto us, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy name be the glory.</p>
            <p>It is not for ſhort-ſighted mortals to fathom the counſels of the moſt high God: His Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are unſearchable; and his ways paſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out.</p>
            <p>But if it be lawful to permit our thoughts to delight us with contemplations on futurity; the American deſert rejoices and bloſſoms as a roſe, cities and empires riſe, arts and ſciences flouriſh, and the ſolitary places are glad. How great is the goodneſs of the Lord, and how great is his beauty! The time cometh, when old men and old women ſhall dwell in our ſtreets, every man with his ſtaff in his hand for very age; when corn ſhall make the young men cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and new wine the maids, and our cities ſhall be full of boys and girls, playing in our ſtreets. But above all, when the aboriginal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall bow the knee at the name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and confeſs him to be Lord, to the glory of God the Father; and pure and undefiled reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhall prevail in the land, and there ſhall be one Lord, and his name one.</p>
