            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <p>A Report has been made to me of a diſturbance that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at the barracks on Wedneſday afternoon, for which I am much concerned; and though the provocations from your people which originally occaſioned it, were of the moſt atrocious nature, I was willing the offender on our part ſhould be properly puniſhed.—But Col. Henley, not content with that, made priſoners eighteen innocent men, and ſent them on board a guard-ſhip, as alledged by your order. It is not only a duty to my ſituation to demand the immediate diſcharge of theſe men, together with a ſatisfactory apology; but I alſo mean it as an attention to you, Sir that I give you an immediate opportunity to diſavow ſo unjuſtifiable a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding as committing men to the worſt of priſons upon vague report, caprice and paſſion.</p>
                     <p>Inſults and provocations at which the moſt placid diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would revolt, are daily given to the officers and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of this army.—Regular, decent complaints are received by your officers, ſometimes with haughtineſs, ſometimes with deriſion, but always without redreſs.—Theſe evils flow, Sir, from the general tenor of language and conduct held by Col. Henley, which encourages his inferiors and ſeems calculated to excite them to the moſt bloody purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>For want of ſufficient information and not bringing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to believe it poſſible, facts as related by common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port could be true, I have hitherto declined taking public notice of this man; but upon poſitive ground, I now, and hereby, formally accuſe Col. Henley of behaviour heinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly criminal as an officer, and unbecoming a man—of the moſt indecent, violent, vindictive ſeverity, againſt unarmed men, and of intentional murder.—I demand prompt and ſatisfactory juſtice, and will not doubt your readineſs to give it. Whenever you will inform me that a proper tribunal is appointed, I will take care that undeniable evidence ſhall be produced to ſupport theſe charges.</p>

               <p>"LIEUTENANT-General Burgoyne accuſes Colonel Henley, of a general tenor of language and conduct heinouſly criminal as an officer; and unbecoming a man; of the moſt indecent, violent, vindictive ſeverity againſt unarmed men; and of intentional murder."</p>
               <p>To which accuſations Col. Henley anſwer'd he was not guilty.</p>
               <p>Obſervations of Gen. Burgoyne upon his letter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to Gen. Heath, and the order for the Court-Martial conſequent thereupon, being read by the Judge-Advocate:</p>
               <p>Lieut. Gen. Burgoyne aroſe and took occaſion to obſerve a diſtinction between the charge as ſtated in his letter, and in Gen. Heath's orders. In the letter, the general tenor of Col. Henley's language and conduct, "Encouraging his inferiors, and ſeeming calculated to excite them to bloody purpoſes," was matter of ſuſpicion, belief and reaſoning, upon the plain principle that it was more candid to ſuppoſe one inſtigator of ſuch evils, than a general voluntary bad diſpoſition among the American troops—that the direct mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of charge which Gen. Burgoyne pledged himſelf for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and officially to ſupport, was contained in the words "Behaviour heinouſly criminal as an officer, and unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man, of the moſt indecent, violent, vindictive ſeverity againſt unarmed men, and of intentional murder."</p>
               <p>Gen. Burgoyne having ſtated this obſervation, as a ſecurity againſt cenſure of inconſiſtency on his part, for not going at large, and in matters of inferior moment into the general tenor of language and conduct of Col. Henley; declared he ſhould confine his evidence to the tranſactions of the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of December, and eighth of January, except in caſes where the behaviour of Col. Henley at other times, ſerved to elucidate the principles and deſigns upon which he acted on thoſe particular days; and Gen. Burgoyne admitted the words ſhould ſtand in the order, without remonſtrance or trouble to the Court, upon the perſuaſion that even as he has now limitted the time, a ſufficiency of evidence would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to make good the whole.—And then addreſſed the Court in ſubſtance as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:016139_0006_0F9B77BDC6FD94D0"/>
                  <hi>Mr. Preſident and Gentlemen of the Court,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Preſent myſelf as proſecutor before you in charges of a heinous nature againſt Col. Henley—and before I begin to adduce the evidence in ſupport of them, I think it a duty to my ſtation, and a part of propriety towards the Court, to declare the principles upon which I act.</p>
               <p>If the reports in my hand, and which will preſently be brought to teſt upon oath, do not deceive me, public faith has been ſhaken, wanton barbarities have been committed, and a general maſſacre of the troops under my command ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently threatened.</p>
               <p>In objects of this magnitude, where not only the rights of a ſingle nation, but the intereſts of human nature are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, the effort of vindication falls indiſpenſably:—How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſagreeable the office, and unequal the talent of the perſon, to him who has the ſupreme truſt of his country upon the ſpot.</p>
               <p>A ſecond inducement to appear here, is that of private ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.—I have undertaken to accuſe Col. Henley in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that ought to effect the feelings of a ſoldier nearer than life.—It is fit that I ſtand forth in perſon to maintain my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, and if it fails in point of proof, to make him the fulleſt attonement in my power.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge a third impulſion upon my mind equally irreſiſtable—gratitude, eſteem, affection to that meritorious, reſpectable part of my country, the brave and honeſt Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſoldiers.</p>
               <p>A private man defenceleſs, becauſe unarmed; ignorant of your laws; unqualified to make good his cauſe in a court of juſtice,— has no where to look for redreſs of injury, but to his own officers.—I confeſs I am too ſelfiſh to reſign to any brother officer the pride and gratification of ſtanding in the front, for the defence of men—faithful comrades of honor and misfortune—who have fought under my orders, who have bled in my preſence, and who are ſuffering oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion &amp; perſecution by the abuſe of a treaty ſigned by my hand.</p>
               <p>Thus much I thought proper to premiſe, leaſt any man ſhould ſuppoſe me actuated by ſo mean and paltry a motive as vindictive perſonal reſentment, againſt a gentleman too of whom before theſe tranſactions, I could know no harm, and towards whom if I had any prejudice, I ſeriouſly declare it
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016139_0007_0F9B77C1FA266DC8"/>
was from his general deportment a favourable one:—Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reſentment!—no gentlemen—I ſtand upon broader and upon firmer ground, the ground of natural right—perſonal protection—and public honor—and I appeal to the great principles and land-marks by which human ſocieties hold and are directed, and which, whether in times of amity or hoſtility, are held equally ſacred by the univerſal concurrence of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized man.</p>
               <p>And this leads me to a momentary reflection upon the order under which you ſit, originating from the report of the Court of Inquiry. It ſtates, "After mature conſideration, are of opinion, that from the evidence offered on the ſide of Gen. Burgoyne, againſt Col. Henley, it will be moſt for the honor of Col. Henley, as well as for the ſatisfaction of all intereſted, that the judgment of a Court-Martial ſhould be taken on his conduct during his command at Cambridge."</p>
               <p>"The General approving of the opinion of the Court, orders," &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I confeſs I expected Gen. Heath would have joined iſſue with the proſecutor in this inſtance, and placed the court-martial upon a more enlarged baſis than the honor of an individual, however reſpectable he may be, or the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mere complainant—but be it as it may, my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is anſwered—a court-martial is obtained; the members are ſworn, and you are bound to decide. I know you will feel with me the difference between this and common courts: Such a ſtate of the minutes as would ſuffice for your internal conviction after hearing the evidence, or as would be merely explanatory to the perſon who is to confirm the ſentence, will not be thought ſufficient here.</p>
               <p>You well know the whole of this matter will be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tranſlated, conſidered, commented upon by every nation in the world; and not only reality but perſpicuity of juſtice muſt appear upon the face of theſe proceedings.—You are truſtees for the honor of an infant ſtate, and therefore evaſion, ſubterfuge and law-craft, was any man hardy enough to offer ſuch to your tribunal, would be of no avail; nay, were it poſſible any member could be warped unintentionally by perſonal favour, or the prejudices of civil conteſt: Good minds are ſometimes prone to ſuch illuſions—yet here a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's reflection upon the reputation of his country, would interfere, and what his prejudice inclined him to adopt, his policy would prompt him to reject.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:016139_0008_0F9B77C332CC2680"/>Upon the full confidence therefore of the neceſſary as well as willing juſtice of the Court, I ſhall proceed to call the evidence. I have neither inclination nor powers to heighten the facts by a previous narrative: Let them ſtrike the view, as truth ſhall ſhew them in all the ſimplicity of their horrors—a monſtrous ſpectacle! from which the eye and the mind will turn aſide with deteſtation.</p>
               <p>The following witneſſes were called in, and being parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly cautioned, were ſworn:</p>
               <p>Corporal Buchannan, 9th regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you preſent at the barracks on proſpect-hill on the 19th December laſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ſee Col, Henley there?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Col. Henley came down and ordered a number of the Britiſh ſoldier's who were priſoners, out of the guard-houſe: Col. Henley addreſſed himſelf to Corporal Reeves, with the reſt of the priſoners, inquiring what he was confined for? Reeves ſaid that he had affronted one of the Provincial offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, not knowing him to be an officer, and he was ſorry for it. Col. Henley reply'd, Sir, if you had ſerved me ſo, I would have run you thro' the body, and I believe you to be a great raſcal. Reeves made anſwer, Sir, I am no raſcal, but a good ſoldier, and my officers know it. Col. Henley then demanded ſilence. On this, Reeves repeated I am no raſcal, but a good ſoldier, and I hope ſoon to be under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Gen. Howe, to carry arms, and to fight for my king and country. Col. Henley ſaid, damn your king and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try—when you had arms you were willing to lay them down. Reeves ſaid he was not willing to lay them down. Col. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley then ordered ſilence; Reeves not obeying his orders, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the ſame words, Col. Henley ordered one of the guard to run him thro' the body: the man not obeying him, Col. Henley immediately diſmounted from his horſe, and ſeizing a firelock with a fixed bayonet from one of the guard, ſtabb'd Reeves in the left breaſt; while the bayonet was at Reeves's breaſt, Col. Henley told him if he ſaid another word, he would have it thro' his body. Reeves ſaid he did not care, he would ſtand for his king and country 'till he died. Col. Henley then made another puſh at him, when I threw up my hand and turned the bayonet over Reeves's ſhoulder.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016139_0009_0F9B77C460A596F8"/>
I told Col. Henley the man was a priſoner, and ſaid don't take his life; as he is now in your cuſtody, you can take other means with him: Col. Henley then return'd the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock to the man of the guard he took it from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Reeves and myſelf into the guard-room, and diſmiſſed the reſt of the priſoners.</p>
               <p>Q By Gen. Burgoyne—When Col. Henley made the ſecond paſs at Reeves, where would it have ſtruck him had you not thrown the bayonet up with your hand?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Much about the ſame place in the left breaſt.</p>
               <p>Q When Col. Henley demanded ſilence, did he direct himſelf particularly to Reeves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I can't tell, as there was ten or a dozen priſoners who were making their excuſes together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not much noiſe made by the priſoners?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There was, as they were all ſpeaking together.</p>
               <p>Q By the Preſident.—What kind of noiſe was it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It was excuſing themſelves to one another, ſo that Col Henley might hear them; that they had been confined there for ſome nights, and they ſhould take care not to come there again.</p>
               <p>Q. By the Preſident.—Was there any other ſort of noiſe or laughing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>Q By the Court—Was there any muttering or grumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or inſolent looks directed to Col. Henley?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, but quite the reverſe; the men ſeemed pleaſed at being releaſed.</p>
               <p>Alexander Thompſon, 29th regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you preſent at or near the barracks on Proſpect-Hill on the 19th of December?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was, and ſaw Col. Henley there—Col. Henley coming up, ordered the priſoners out of the guard-houſe, of whom I was one—the priſoners were drawn up before the guard-room window, the guard in their front—Col. Henley pulling a paper out of his pocket<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> began to read the crimes at the right of the line of the priſoners—Col. Henley ſaid, now ſoldiers I am come to releaſe you, and hope you will behave better for the future—Col. Henley directing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to corporal Reeves, told him he was confined for abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an officer of the Continental ſervice; and aſked him what was the reaſon of his abuſe? Reeves replied he did
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016139_0010_0F9B77C49EB68898"/>
not know the reaſon of the abuſe as he was in liquor at the time, but ſaid he was very ſorry for it, not knowing him to be an officer: Col. Henley then ſaid had it been me, I would have certainly run you thro' the body, and added, I believe you to be a raſcal. Reeves ſaid he was no raſcal, but was a good ſoldier, and his officers knew it: Col. Henley demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſilence and Reeves again ſaid that he was a good ſoldier, and hoped in a ſhort time to fight under Gen. Howe for his king and country: Col. Henley then ſaid, damn your king and country, when you had arms you were willing to lay them down. Corporal Reeves made anſwer that he was not willing to lay them down, and had he then arms, he would do his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to fight for his king and country; Col. Henley then order'd one of his guard to run the raſcal thro'. The man not obeying, he immediately diſmounted his horſe, ſeized a firelock with a fix'd bayonet from one of the guard, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his arm above his head, with his hand on the butt of the fire-lock, and made a paſs at corporal Reeves and prick'd him near the nipple of the leaft breaſt; he then drew back the fire-lock and made another paſs at him; I then ſeized hold of the ſocket of the bayonet and begg'd of Col. Henley not to take his life, that he might uſe other means of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and begg'd he would ſend him into the guard-room again; Col. Henley then order'd Reeves into the guard-room, the guard committed him, and Col. Henley went on to ſpeak to the reſt of the priſoners. Reeves put his head out of the guard-houſe window and ſaid ſomething, but the deponent does not know what. Col. Henley then releaſed the reſt of the priſoners, except Buchannan, who was orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the guard-houſe.</p>
               <p>Q. By the Preſident.—Was there noting ſaid by Reeves between the firſt and ſecond paſs of Col. Henley?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To the beſt of my recollection there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Col. Henley frequently command ſilence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſtabb'd Reeves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I believe he did more than once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Col. Henley direct himſelf to Reeves when he demanded ſilence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He look'd firſt at Reeves, and then along the line of priſoners.</p>
               <p>Q Was not Reeves more talkative than any of the other priſoners?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:016139_0011_0F9B77C54DBD26A0"/>Q. Was there any thing ſaid about King Hancock?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I heard nothing.</p>
               <p>The ſame queſtion was put to Buchannan.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not 'till after Reeves was returned to the guard-room, and the other priſoners diſmiſſed; Reeves then ſaid to me (Buchannan) this is a poor paſs I am come to, to be taken out of the guard-houſe and ſtabb'd, and my king and country damn'd—damn King Hancock and the Congreſs. Whether Col. Henley heard it or not I can't ſay; he might have heard it: This diſcourſe was between Reeves and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as we ſtood near the guard-houſe window.</p>
               <p>Q. To Thompſon.—Did any one aſſiſt you in warding off the ſecond paſs made by Col. Henley at Reeves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; Corporal Buchannan had hold of the firelock at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Col. Henley addreſs the priſoners when they were firſt paraded, in a mild and civil manner?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He did.</p>
               <p>Dr. Bowen, acting ſurgeon to the 9th regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ſee corporal Reeves after he was wounded by Col. Henley?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did a few hours after; the wound appeared to be made by a bayonet, it penetrated the breaſt a little above the left nipple; the wound was not ſo bad as to require imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate dreſſing; the wound was ſlight, it did not penetrate deep enough to be of any conſequence, it might have drawn a drop or two of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. By Gen. Burgoyne—What further depth would have put his life in danger?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> An inch farther might have rendered the wound ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous.</p>
               <p>Q. By Gen. Burgoyne.—Was the direction of the wound towards the heart, or a mortal part?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It was not towards the heart, but towards a mortal part.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Robert Steel, ſerjeant 62d regiment.]</p>
               <p>Q. WAS you at the barracks on proſpect-hill on the 19th December?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ſee Col. Henley there?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did; Col. Henley came down to releaſe ſome Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſoldiers, priſoners in the guard-houſe there; the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were ordered out and paraded in the front of the guard-houſe; Col. Henley aſked the priſoners their names, and what crimes they were confined for? corporal Reeves told him that he was confin'd for abuſing a Provincial officer in Cambridge, and ſaid he did not know him to be an officer, if he had he would not have abuſed him, was very ſorry for it, and ready to aſk his pardon; Col. Henley made anſwer that if it had been him he had abuſed, he would certainly have run him thro', and told him he believed him to be a damn'd raſcal. Reeves reply'd I am no raſcal, Sir, but a good ſoldier, and my officers know it; and I hope in a ſhort time to join Gen. Howe, and fight for my king and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Col. Henley reply'd, damn your king and country, what do we care for your king and country; when you had arms you laid them down very willingly. No, Sir, Reeves reply'd, we did not, we were willing to fight. Upon this, Col. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley order'd one of the guard to run him thro', his order not being comply'd with, Col. Henley diſmounted from his horſe, ſeiz'd one of the guard's fire-lock and ſtabb'd Reeves in the breaſt; Reeves demanded the reaſon of his ſtabbing him? Col. Henley cry'd ſilence, Sir, and made another paſs at him, two of the priſoners who ſtood neareſt Reeves, ſeiz'd the fire-lock, and deſired Col. Henley not to take his life, as he was a priſoner, and his life was in his hands: Col. Henley then told him he would ſend him on board a guard-ſhip, and ordered him into the guard-room; he releas'd the reſt of the priſoners, excepting Reeves and corporal Buchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Col. Henley ſtabb'd Reeves, did he not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him more than once to be ſilent?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not that I know of.</p>

                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:016139_0013_0F9B77C6DC357B38"/>Q. Did not the Colonel command ſilence among the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners before he ſtabb'd Reeves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> After he ſtabb'd him he did, I don't know that he did before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear Reeves ſay King Hancock was an impudent fellow for coming to ſee their General?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is what you have now related the whole of what you heard and ſaw paſs between Col. Henley and Reeves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your ſituation ſuch that you might have ſeen and heard every thing that paſſed between Reeves and Col. Henley?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It was; but I did not attend to all that paſſed.</p>
               <p>Q. By the Preſident.—After Col. Henley ſtabbed Reeves, before he made the ſecond paſs at him, did he not command ſilence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He did; but Reeves ſaid he would not be ſilent, or words to that purpoſe, he would ſtick up to his king and country.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not obſerve.</p>
               <p>Q. By Col. Henley.—When I firſt came down to releaſe the priſoners, did I not appear in good humour towards the priſoners?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was, and ſaw a guard of Continental ſoldiers about eleven o'clock, A. M. coming up from Winter-hill; when they came near the Britiſh guard-houſe, a number of us were ſtanding to ſee them march by, I happen'd to tread on one of my comrade's toes, and he cry'd out God damn my ſoul, when a ſerjeant (as I took him to be as he was out of the ranks) turn'd about, ſteped back two or three paces, and ſtabb'd him in the right breaſt, then drew out his bayonet from the man's breaſt, and ſaid to the man damn you, you raſcal do you damn me? the ſoldier made anſwer no; I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſaid that he did not ſpeak to him; he then made another puſh at him, and prick'd him the ſecond time, and then
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016139_0014_0F9B77E7C7CA7608"/>
clubb'd his firelock and cut him on his right temple; a Provincial officer, came from the rear of the party and damn'd us for raſcals, and told us we all deſerv'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ſee Col. Henley at or near the party during this tranſaction?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> I was diſtant about thirty yards, and neither ſaw or heard any provocation on the part of the Britiſh ſoldiers to the Continental guard; I was attentively counting the files of the guard as they paſſed; when the rear of the guard came near the Britiſh guard-room, I obſerv'd a ſcuffle, the guard paſſed on; I went up and found Traggot, a Britiſh ſoldier, had been wounded by one of the guard as I was told, and the blood was then running down the ſide of his face. I order'd the men to diſperſe and they went off immediately.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> They did; ſome of them in moving fell into the ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. By Col Henley—Was the falling into the ditch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after Hadley was wounded?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Both before and after.</p>
               <p>Q. By Col. Henley.—Was you not preſent when I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd off thirty or forty men from the left of the party, and gave them to the command of an officer to take charge of the Britiſh priſoners?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was, and they went into the fort.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time when I had weakened my party, did not the Britiſh ſoldiers crowd upon me to hear the orders I was giving to my officers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not obſerve it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you on the parade?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> About ten or twelve minutes, and then left it; all the Britiſh ſoldiers had not left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Hadley wounded before or after Col. Henley had detached a party into the fort?</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> I was in the forenoon of the 8th; Col. Henley came up with a party of Provincials and marched them very near the flag-ſtaff on the hill, there halted them and ſent off a party to take care of ſome priſoners, the remainder he formed in two diviſions; a number of Britiſh ſoldiers came up to ſee what was the matter, and Col. Henley deſir'd them to diſperſe, upon that the Britiſh ſoldiers immediately moved off at a moderate pace, when Col. Henley made a puſh with his ſword, but I don't know he hurt any body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he afterwards walked a few paces, turned about and ſtabb'd Corporal Hadley thro' his left arm into his left ſide: Winks of the 9th regiment, being the laſt moving off the parade, Col.

not ſure which, and a Provincial ſoldier puſh'd Winks into the ditch; I went off.—I was on the parade from the time of Col. Henley's coming up with the party 'till he march'd them off, which might be half an hour or three quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a greater number of Britiſh ſoldiers round the party than the party conſiſted of?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I do not think there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any abuſe of any kind offer'd by the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſoldiers to Col. Henley or his party?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I heard nor ſaw none.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Col. Henley repeatedly order the Britiſh ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to leave the parade before he ſtabb'd Hadley?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I heard him only once.</p>
               <p>Q. After Col Henley made the firſt paſs at the Britiſh ſoldiers, did he not order them to diſperſe before he wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hadley?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He did not.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Four or five yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Colonel declare to the Britiſh ſoldiers that he had had a priſoner reſcued, and if another was reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued he would fire upon them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Col. Henley ſwore before he would have a priſoner reſcued from him, he would ſend every Britiſh ſoldier on board the guard-ſhips.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was there when Col. Henley with a party came up; he form'd his party in two columns, and ordered all that were not loaded to load directly; after they were loaded and ſhouldered, he told his own men that the firſt man who reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued a priſoner out of his hand, he would blow his brains out; he then turned about with his ſword in his hand, and ordered the Britiſh ſoldiers to leave the parade immediately; they moved off directly; Col. Henley finding the men did
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016139_0023_0F9B77F601239C58"/>
not go off ſo faſt as he expected, he went up to Hadley who was in the rear of the Britiſh ſoldiers, and ſtabb'd him, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſword back which was much bent; he came up to me after he had ſtraightened it on his knee, as I was going off as faſt as I could walk, followed me ten paces and damn'd me for a raſcal, and told me if I did not go off the parade he would run me thro' the body; I was getting off and one of the Provincial ſerjeants knock'd me into the ditch; I got up and went to my barracks.</p>
               <p>Q Did not the Britiſh ſoldiers crowd on Col. Henley's party?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> They did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no abuſe offer'd to Col. Henley or the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the Britiſh ſoldiers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There was not of any kind that I ſaw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Britiſh ſoldiers ſurround Col. Henley's party?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They were chiefly hemm'd in between the party and the barracks in the front of the party.</p>
               <p>Q. By General Burgoyne.—Was you ſo near that if any inſult had been offer'd to Col. Henley's party, you muſt have ſeen it?</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was between 11 and 12 in the forenoon; coming out of my barracks I ſaw a number of Britiſh ſoldiers going up towards the flag-ſtaff, I went up to know the occaſion of it, when I got up I ſaw a number of Britiſh ſoldiers ſtanding in front of a Provincial guard, and Col. Henley at the head of them, with his ſword drawn in his hand; Col. Henley deſired the Britiſh ſoldiers to move back, which they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately complied with, they not moving ſo quick as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Col. Henley could wiſh, I ſaw Col. Henley move up quick towards the crowd, and make a paſs at Corporal Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, of the 9th regiment, which wounded him thro' the left arm into the left ſide and bent his ſword with the force of the paſs; Hadley went off immediately to his barrack, not uſing any words either before or after, as I heard; Col. Henley walked towards his party ſtraightning his ſword with his left hand; I went away and ſaw nothing more.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> About ſixty or ſeventy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any ſort of abuſe offer'd to Col. Henley or the party, by the Britiſh ſoldiers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I ſaw none; and I was ſo ſituated that I muſt have ſeen it if any had been offer'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Britiſh ſoldiers move off on being order'd, as faſt as they might have done?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I think they did; thoſe in the front run, the rear could not get off ſo quick on account of the crowd.</p>
               <p>Q. When Col. Henley ſtabb'd Hadley, did he appear in a paſſion?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Between eleven and twelve beforenoon I was going to the upper barracks, and at the barrier gate there was a Provincial ſentry who ſtop'd me and ſaid, I could not go in there; ſuppoſing he did not know me for an officer, I told him I ſuppoſed his orders were not to ſtop officers, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced his anſwer by charging his bayonet, ſaid he did not care who, or what I was, I ſhould not paſs there; I told him he need not be violent, I ſhould not attempt to paſs him; I <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Henley between the rear of a barrack and the guard, with his ſword drawn, making motions with his ſword on his knee, as if he was ſtraightning of it; upon my coming quite up to the rear of the guard, I ſaw and heard a perſon who I took to be the Captain of the guard, damn his men on the right for not being more attentive, deſiring them to run any man through, who attempted to come near them; I did not know at that time that Col.

               <p>Q. DID you ſee Colonel Henley on the 8th of January?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> On the 8th of January, my orderly ſerjeant came and inform'd me that on the night of 7th, twelve men of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment had been taken out of the barracks; upon the report, I ſet out for the barracks, and in my way heard they were brought down to Col. Henley's quarters, I went to Col. Henley to inquire into the cauſe of their confinement: at Col. Henley's gate, I was deny'd admittance by two cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; after ſome time, upon application to an officer, I got admittance to Col. Henley, and upon enquiring into the cauſes of my men's confinement, was referr'd to a gentleman, who I afterwards underſtood was Col. Gerriſh of the militia, who told me the Britiſh ſoldiers had behaved very odd the night before, and that he had a great mind to have fir'd into the door and windows of the barracks upon them, and ſhould have done it, had he not been afraid of killing ſome of his own men; upon obſerving this was very odd to Col. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Col Henley told me that the Britiſh ſoldiers had behaved ſo hadly that morning, that he was obliged to run one of them thro' the body, and that ſome others had been hurt by his men's bayonets: I then left Col. Henley and went down to the barracks, where on enquiry I found one of the men had been out of his barrack after nine o'clock; I order'd him confin'd; a regimental court-martial ſet upon him, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced the man to be puniſh'd for the offence; the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were communicated to Col. Henley, and an officer ſent to know if Col. Henley would order out his men to ſee the puniſhment inflicted—Col. Henley ſent me word back I might do as I pleaſed with the man, but he ſhould not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere, or order his men out.—The man receiv'd his puniſhment the next day at 12 o'clock, in the preſence of the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man who was puniſhed for being out of his barrack belong to the ſame room where the twelve men were taken?</p>

                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:016139_0026_0F9B77F8FAFF60D8"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He did not, but to a room in a different part of the barrack.</p>
               <p>Q. By Gen. Burgoyne.—When you went down to the barrack did you make a particular inquiry into the tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the preceeding night?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As far as I was able I did; and found on an examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the non-commiſſion'd officers that the men had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved peaceably, except one man who being in liquor, had been out of his barrack after nine o'clock, and who I had puniſhed as before related.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you preſent at Col. Henley's the day Col. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruther had the converſation he has related with Col. Henley?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was; and confirm Col. Anſtruther's relation.</p>
               <p>Dr. Bowen acting ſurgeon 9th regiment.]</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend corporal Hadley from the time of his being wounded?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I attended him except the firſt dreſſing. About one o'clock on the 8th inſt. I was called to dreſs corporal Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's wounds, and ſound upon examination, the ſword had paſs'd thro' the left arm and entered his left ſide; I dreſs'd his wound, the inſtrument had penetrated the membrane under the ſkin that lies over the muſcle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wound, ſo deep in the ſide as to require im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate dreſſing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> It did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wound of ſuch a nature as to put the man's life in danger?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the arm did the ſword paſs through?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It paſs'd over the muſcles on the back of the arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the diſtance of the two orifices on the arm?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> About half an inch or a little more.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you dreſs the wound in the ſide?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Near a week, when it was well; I dreſs'd the wound daily 'till it was heal'd.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the ſtate of the wound in the arm now?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is well; I dreſs'd it 'till about ſix days ago, when it was ſo far heal'd as to require no further dreſſing.</p>
               <p>Q. By General Burgoyne.—Suppoſing the ſword to have miſs'd the arm, would it have penetrated ſo far as to make the wound dangerous?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:016139_0027_0F9B77FBD7FF5750"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I imagine it would have penetrated the cavity had not a ribb interfered, and in that caſe it muſt have been dangerous.</p>
               <p>Q Are you poſitive that the ſword did not touch a ribb?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I am poſitive it did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the reſiſtance of the cloaths and the fleſh of the arm ſufficient to have bent the ſword?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I make no doubt but they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Muſt not the paſs then have been made with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable violence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. By the Court.—Did it appear from the nature and direction of the wound that Col. Henley deſign'd to have taken the man's life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> From its paſſing ſo ſlightly thro' the arm, I imagine the ſword was aim'd at the body.</p>
               <p>Q. By the Court.—Were the wounds ſuch as to take him off his duty?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They were; and he has not been return'd well 'till within theſe three or four days.</p>

               <p>Q. By General Burgoyne—Was you preſent at any time in December when a Provincial ſentry fir'd at one or more Women?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was; on or about the 22d December, being field-officer of the week, I was going upon Proſpect-hill in the forenoon with Capt. Banks of the ſame regiment, I ſaw three women coming down the hill, one of which run paſt a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental ſentry, who call'd upon her to ſtop, and immediately fir'd his piece before ſhe had time to turn round, the ball from the noiſe, paſſed between the woman and myſelf, and near me; I order'd the woman to go back, and went up to the centry and aſk'd him if he was not aſham'd to fire upon a helpleſs woman, he reply'd he had orders for ſo doing; I then went to a ſerjeant's guard which was juſt by, told the ſerjeant what had happen'd, and deſired him to confine the ſentry that the affair might be inquired into; he told me he would not confine him, that they had orders to fire upon all Britiſh ſoldiers and women, who attempted to paſs the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; I obſerved a number of Britiſh ſoldiers were collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who were murmuring and clamouring at the time. I therefore, for fear of the conſequences, deſir'd them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:016139_0028_0F9B77FD1644B2E8"/>
to diſperſe and go to their barracks, and promiſed them my endeavour to get them redreſs'd:—I then went towards the main or captain's guard, and in my way was ſtop'd by a Provincial ſentry, who charg'd his bayonet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one me, with the muzzle pointed at my breaſt, I told him I only wanted to ſpeak to the captain of the guard, and did not want to go further, and begg'd he would call him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the muzzle of his gun from my breaſt; he ſaid he would keep the muzzle there, and bid me keep off, and then call'd the ſerjeant of the guard, who immediately came up, who I deſired would order the ſentry to remove his firelock as I was an officer and commanded in the barracks, and wanted to ſpeak to the captain of the guard upon buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The ſerjeant told the man to take away his gun, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me he was a young ſoldier and did not know better, the captain of the guard came up ſoon after and I pulled my hat off, which he took no notice of. I then told him the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſentry's firing on the woman, and begged the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try might be confin'd 'till the affair ſhould be inquired into; he told me that he would not, and that the ſentries had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular orders to fire on all women who attempted to paſs the ſentries, as well as ſoldiers. I obſerved it muſt be ſome miſtake, he reply'd it was none of his buſineſs, they were his orders, and I muſt ſeek redreſs ſomewhere elſe, and we parted.</p>

Henley extended his arm with his fiſt clinch'd, and exclaim'd, you raſcal, I'll make damnation fly out of you, and I will myſelf one of theſe nights go the rounds, and if I hoar the leaſt word or noiſe in your barrack, I'll pour ſhot

               <p>GENERAL Burgoyne having claimed liberty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking upon the evidence, and argumentatively ſupporting the charge againſt Col. Henley, I riſe to object to his claim. In Courts-Martial, there is no proſecutor but the Judge-Advocate; there have been inſtances of Council allowed the priſoner, but not againſt him: And I call upon the Generals and Field-Officers of the Britiſh army, now
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:016139_0030_0F9B77FF06FACDE0"/>
in Court, to point out a ſingle exception to what I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced; yet if Col. Henley has no objection, and the Court concedes to it as an indulgence, I ſhall acquieſce.</p>
               <p>General Burgoyne expreſſed ſurpriſe at the Judge-Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate's exception being made ſo late in the cauſe; he thought it more particularly extraordinary, as the General had not only ſtated his idea of the mode of proceeding at the firſt, in which the Judge-Advocate had acquieſced, but at the laſt meeting it had been fully diſcuſſed in open Court between them, and the Judge-Advocate had agreed to the General's right both of applying the evidence upon the charge, and alſo of replying to the defence, provided he, the Judge-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, had the cloſing of the whole. The General obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that had the Court declared againſt this claim in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, or cou'd he have expected ſuch objection, he ſhould have examined the witneſſes in a very different manner, in order to bring ſeveral matters more fully and pointedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Court than he thought neceſſary to do upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a future occaſion to explain the reaſons of his queſtions, and by deduction and inference to make the application.</p>
               <p>The General nevertheleſs propoſed that the principle upon which he ſpoke ſhould lie dormant to avoid trouble to the Court, that he had his own opinion upon the right, the Judge Advocate might retain his upon the indulgence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided nothing concerning the matter was entred upon the proceedings, he ſhould make uſe of the power without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtion.</p>
               <p>Col. Henley.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Preſident and Gentlemen of the Court,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Have no objection to Gen. Burgoyne's making uſe of all the rhetorick in his power againſt me; I ſtand on ſuch firm ground, I can ſafely truſt my reputation in your hands, againſt every effort of my proſecutor to ruin me.</p>
               <p>The Court then told the General he might proceed, and he addreſſed the Court as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Preſident and Gentlemen of the Court,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT being now admitted that in cloſing the evidence, I may offer ſuch arguments as to me ſhall ſeem proper, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the charge, and reſerving to myſelf a claim of reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the defence, I ſhall enter upon the firſt part of the very painful, tho' by no means difficult undertaking:—
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:016139_0031_0F9B77FFC41CC7B8"/>
Painful, becauſe I cannot purſue the offence without ſetting the offender in points of view at which every benignant mind muſt ſhudder—Eaſy in every other reſpect is the taſk, becauſe I venture to pronounce the evidence when arranged and adjuſted, will amount to ſuch a maſs of proof as cannot be overthrown, and will authoriſe and call for the ſtrongeſt terms I can uſe in my demand of public juſtice. And Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, let me be permitted to aſſume to myſelf applauſe rather than blame, that the evidence has not been laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you in a regular ſeries; the reaſon was, that though aſſured by the reports made to me that the evidence would produce conviction upon the whole, I was ignorant how the teſtimony of the particular witneſſes would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and point to the progreſſion of the charges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had had no previous intorcourſe with them. I declare upon my ſolemn word of honor, that I have had no concert or communication directly or indirectly with any non-commiſſioned officer or ſoldier who has appeared at your bar, one only excepted, viz. ſerjeant Fleming of the 47th regiment, who has depoſed to the ſalutation Col. Henley, gave to him at the Adjutant-General's office; that whole matter appeared to me ſo very improbable, that I not only ſent for the ſerjeant to warn him of the ſacredneſs of an oath, and of the ſin of intemperate zeal, but alſo I thought it my duty to inquire minutely into his character; I found the man firm and uniform in averting his veracity, I found his officers unanimous in ſupporting his credit.</p>
               <p>In every other inſtance I adhered religiouſly to the determination I had taken of ſecluding myſelf from the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, not only to guard my character in this region of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion and aſperſion, againſt the ſuppoſition of unfair practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; I beſides had a ſcruple of truſting my own mind with too haſty progreſſions in a cauſe wherewith the moſt ſolemn matter of a public nature is involved the fate of a gentleman high in his military ſtation, and to judge by the apparent ſigns of good wiſhes on this day, alſo high in popular eſteem.</p>
               <p>Thus unprejudiced I came into your court, I ſcorn to rake up the ſlighter matters that might be comprehended in the general words of the charge, ſuch as perſonal incivility to officers expreſſions and actions of peeviſhneſs, haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſguſt. I mean not to preſs that they exiſted, or if they did, I am deſirous they ſhould paſs as faults of temper
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:016139_0032_0F9B78008120F4A8"/>
and deficiencies of manners incident to a man's nature, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and habitual courſe of life; and I ſhall confine my comment as it is my duty to do, to the teſtimonies upon your minutes, and the circumſtances immediately relating to them.</p>
               <p>Without departing from this principle, it will be neceſſary to take a general review of the ſtate of things previous to the date of the grievances complained of.</p>
               <p>We arrived at Cambridge paſſengers through your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try under the ſanction of a truce. In whatever capacity we had been found in a foreign and independent ſtate, we were intitled to perſonal protection by the general and moſt ſacred laws of truth and reaſon; but when to the promulgated law of civilization are added the written principles—or written only upon the hearts of generous people—honor, reſpect for the brave, the hoſpitable wiſhes that uſually preſs to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the unfortunate, the ſtranger, and the defenceleſs man in your power, how will our claims multiply upon the mind? Sanguine imaginations conceived yet further motives for kindneſs. There were men among us ſo vain as to believe that notwithſtanding the preſent ſeparation between us, the different duties we now maintained, the prejudices of politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal zeal, and the animoſity of civil war;—Yet ſtill the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict over, it might be remembered we once were brothers, and the more eſpecially as it was improbable by the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saratoga, that the generality of us ſhould ever oppoſe America in arms again.</p>
               <p>We were led into theſe deluſive hopes by the very honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able treatment ſhewn us by General Gates, by that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from you Mr. Preſident when you conducted us upon the march, and from that we afterwards found from the worthy member of the Court near you, who had the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate command in this diſtrict upon our arrival and to whom moſt happily for us the ſame command is now again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſymptom we diſcovered of any uncandid deſigns, was the mode eſtabliſhed for correcting errors and diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the troops of the Convention; men were taken up, impriſoned, and otherwiſe puniſhed by the American troops, without any prior reference to their own officers. I very well know with how much ſlight and even deriſion my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been treated upon this ſubject; but I ſtill <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:016139_0033_0F9B780332B29B70"/>
that after taking men up for faults, to have applied to the officers of the Convention troops in the firſt inſtance for their puniſhment, would have been conſonant to every principle of decorum and good policy; not meaning to deny that upon any proof of partiality, or connivance, or undue lenity, it then became the proper and indiſpenſable duty of General Heath, to take the diſtribution of juſtice into his own hands.</p>
               <p>The contrary maxim having been eſtabliſhed, let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how it was carried into execution.—And the firſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in point of time, tho' the laſt in the proceedings, is that burſt of indecency, ſcurrility and impiety, from Col. Honley to the Quarter-Maſter-Serjeants at the Adjutant-General's office—it is not without difficulty I can frame my mouth to read the words as they were delivered upon oath, by that very reſpectable witneſs Serjeant Fleming, viz.— "You raſcals, I'll make damnation fly out of ye, and I will myſelf one of theſe nights go the rounds, and if I hear me leaſt word or noiſe in your barracks, I'll pour ſhot amongſt ye, and make flames of hell jump out of ye, and turn your barracks inſide-out."</p>
               <p>The Court will remember that when this evidence was given, it rather excited laughter in ſome part of the audience, than any ſerious condemnation.</p>
               <p>This day it ſeems to make a very different impreſſion.— The minds of all around will follow me, while I contend that expreſſions ſo wild, ſo unfit, ſo unprecedented from the mouth of a gentleman, argue the moſt diabolical paſſions boiling in the breaſt, the very enthuſiaſm of rancour and malice.</p>
               <p>I defy any man to divert himſelf of that idea, it will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the mind through the whole courſe of theſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and caſt a ſhocking glare over every ſubſequent tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, of fore-thought, intention and bloody reſolution.</p>
               <p>It is very material to obſerve that this demonſtration of Col. Henley's mind, was on or about the 16th December, and it was no longer than 'till 19th, before he confirmed by overt act the principles he had profeſſed.</p>
               <p>The ſtabbing of Corporal Reeves is proved by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Corporal Buchannan, Alexander Thompſon and Robert Steel.</p>
               <p>I ſhall quote indiſcrminately from the teſtimony of one or other of theſe witneſſes, becauſe tho' ſome recollect a few
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:016139_0034_0F9B7805927B56A8"/>
ſhort paſſages or words more than others, there is not a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of contradiction, and I am confident there never was an inſtance where truth was ever laid before a Court by united evidence more perſpicuouſly.</p>
               <p>It has been ſworn "That on the morning of the 19th of December, Col. Henley went to the barracks on Proſpect-Hill, to releaſe ſome Britiſh ſoldiers who were priſoners; that having had them paraded, he read over their crimes, and coming to Reeves told him he was confin'd for inſulting a Provincial officer; Reeves made anſwer be was very ſorry for it, that he was in liquor, and would not have acted ſo had he known him to have been an officer."—I pauſe here to apply to the feelings of the Court, whether a more decent, proper, ſatisfactory excuſe could have been conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; what did it draw from the Colonel?—"Had it been me you had ſerved ſo, I would have run you thro' the body you raſcal"—Continue the compariſon between the language of the Colonel and the Corporal—Sir, I am no raſcal, but a good ſoldier, and my officers know it, and I hope ſoon to be with Gen. Howe and fight for my king and country—what did this produce from the Colonel?—"Damn your king and country," and an order to the guard "to run him through the body,"—not a hand nor a heart could be found for the butchery; the Colonel enraged at the virtuous diſobedience of his men, leaps from his horſe, ſeizes a firelock with a fix'd bayonet, and ſtrikes at the man's heart. I call upon the gentleman of a learned profeſſion near me to inform the Court when he ſums up the evidence at the cloſe of the trial, whether this act would not conſtitute malice propenſe in law. I mean that admitting for the ſake of the argument, that there had been ſuch provocation given as would have juſtified a man having an offenſive weapon to make uſe of it inſtantly, which would have been only manſlaughter; the intermediate act of diſmounting his horſe and taking a firelock from the other, implying time for recollection, would have made the act wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful murder, had the man died. Conſider now gentlemen what followed.— The brave Corporal in the inſtant expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation his words would coſt him his life, perſevered—I don't care, I will ſtand by my king and country 'till I die. The action would have charmed a brave man; it would have been a ſpell upon his arm, and kept the ſtroke ſuſpended beyond the power of witchcraft—What effect had it upon the Colonel
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:016139_0035_0F9B78072A838B80"/>
—to provoke a ſecond ſtab, which was only diverted by the intervention of the man next him, who caught hold of the bayonet and threw it up.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, when I ſay the perſeverance of the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ought rather to have pleaſed than provoked. I ſpeak not vaguely or romantically, I feel conſcious proof of the truth— and when I conſider the actions of a Waſhington—when I meet in the field a Gates, an Arnold, a General Glover— and ſee them bravely facing death in ſupport of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, though I would ſhed my laſt blood upon a different conviction, I cannot withhold from the enemy the reſpect due to the ſoldier, and the immediate conflict over, he robs me of my anger and ſeizes my good will.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, in the different parts of the examination up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this fact, many queſtions have been aſked by the priſoner, by the Judge-Advocate, and by the Court reſpecting the appearance of the priſoner's temper—was he not in a mild mood?—Did he not ſeem good humour'd? Mild murder! Good humour'd murder!—are phraſes I fancy will not convey any clear meaning, 'till men change their ideas of that crime.—We hear 'tis true ſometimes as a ſort of proverb to mark the utmoſt malignity and treachery of a man ſmiling in your face while he cuts your throat, but I believe it never was produced as an excuſe or extenuation of guilt.—Theſe queſtions therefore, as I conceive can have no tendency but to inſinuate that Col. Henley's paſſion was entirely raiſed by the immediate provocation he received; I am ready to join iſſue upon this argument, and if the Gentleman will reſt his cauſe upon it, I will relinquiſh the proof eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed of Reeve's decency and conſiſtency, and give him latitude for all the provocation he can ſuppoſe, ſhort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal aſſault, and the neceſſity of ſelf-defence, which I am ſure will not be pretended.—I will tranſpoſe if he pleaſes the time when Reeves is proved to have talked about King Hancock, and bring it back to the inſtant where it was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to be introduced, as a ſubſtantial matter of provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—he ſhall add inſolence of geſture to abuſive terms, and under all theſe fictitious circumſtances I will take the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Court, whether Col. Henley with full power to impriſon and to puniſh by regular, decent, legal proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, has a ſhadow of juſtification <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> making himſelf in his own perſon, party, judge and executioner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:016139_0036_0F9B780742618328"/>From the 19th December, the hands of Col. Henley were unembrued in blood 'till the 8th of January, but it evidently appears upon your proceedings that the influence of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and the encouragement of his precepts failed not to operate, as the firſt proof of it. I requeſt the attention of the Court to the teſtimony of Col. Lind; the poſition of the ſentry which was ſuch as muſt neceſſarily effect every paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon the public road whenever he fired, and at the ſame time a readineſs to do miſchief ſo marked that he took wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for his objects, and would not give them time to turn round; he had orders ſo to do. Let the behavior of the next ſentry to whom Col. Lind applied, the ungentleman-like behavior of the officer, with his confirmation of the whole proceeding, being according to order, be combined and compared, and it muſt univerſally ſtrike common ſenſe, that theſe were ſeveral parts of one determined plan to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the ſeeds of diſcord and fury, in order afterwards to countenance a general havock.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid the orders under which the Continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal troops acted were not thoſe of Col. Henley, but of a ſuperior—will that be pleaded? was the poſition of the ſentries to kill or wound three or four paſſengers at a ſhot, the firing upon innocent women, the refuſal of redreſs to Col. Lind, with all the indecent manner and language attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; will theſe circumſtances be alledged to have proceeded from ſuperior orders? If ſo, the excuſe becomes indeed more alarming to us.—It is my part at this time to drop a conſideration that would lead ſo far.—I ſhall only remark how little the excuſe would benefit Col. Henley, who would ſtill remain a cruel agent of (I will uſe no improper term) I will only ſay a cruel agent of a too haſty principal.</p>
               <p>Col. Henley has aſked whether complaint was made to him of the tranſactions of the 22d—I believe they were not—but I dare ſay he will recollect the reaſons—other grievances of the moſt atrocious nature, abuſe of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and aſſaults upon their lives, were preparing to lay before General Heath. They were in number and in time to have filled up much more of the interval between the 19th December and 8th January; but not brought before this Court becauſe I underſtood it to be the intention of Gen. Heath they ſhould be ſeperately enquired into. Enough has appeared to ſhew how the ſyſtem of perſecution was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and I come now to the tranſactions of the 8th of January.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:016139_0037_0F9B780807C64BA0"/>Upon a general view of that black day, I am at a loſs where firſt to carry your obſervation.—The field was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive, the ſcenes ſeperate and ſucceſſive, but evidently gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by one uniform deſign — In one place a party on the march are ſtabbing and knocking out the brains of inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſpectators—at another men under pretence of a priſoner's eſcape, are glutting the ſame bloody purpoſes upon men not pretended to be concerned—in athird Col. Henley in perſon (the Britiſh officers at the ſame time being deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed admittance, as appears by the evidence of Lieut. Bibby) is running men through the body with his ſword.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe complicated horrors in point of time, was the attack upon Traggett, firſt with the bayonet and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with the butt of the firelock.—I will read the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence without a comment. (Vide the evidence in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.) And I have only now to remark (it is not an unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable idea to the Continental troops) that ſuch malicious treatment could not be upon a general ſentiment—no body of people are ſo barbarous unleſs inſtigated—and now is the time to call upon the learned Gentleman near me for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duty of his office, to expound to the Court the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of law reſpecting acceſſaries and accomplices, and to ſay whether a man by order, advice, example, or any other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, influencing another to do a miſchievous act, is not <hi>particeps criminis</hi> at an hundred miles diſtance, as much as if preſent upon the ſpot.</p>
               <p>The ſtabbing of Wilſon follows in the courſe of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; (vide proceedings) and it appears as little comment is neceſſary upon this as upon the former action, further than to remark that in this caſe Col. Henley is found to be acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary not upon circumſtantial, preſumptive and argumentative, but upon poſitive proof; for it is ſworn the action was done within his ſight; that he made no attempt to prevent it; and though it ſhould be alledged and admitted that he was at too great a diſtance, yet his giving no reprimand nor check to the ſoldiers upon ſeeing the act committed, carries as direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of approbation and encouragement, as if he had given open applauſe.</p>
               <p>The laſt act to mark the thirſt of blood, was the ſtabbing of Corporal Hadley, and following Winks with threats of the ſame fate.— It would be ſuperfluous to expatiate upon the ſtrength of the proofs, the concurrence of witneſſes that
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:016139_0038_0F9B7808C4344758"/>
there was no provocation, the deliberation and the wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the barbarity.—The intention is ſo clear in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the probability of doubt, that I ſhould not touch a moment upon it, were it not that a very grave application was made to the Court, by the moſt reſpectable authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it, to conſider the nature of wounds as matters of the greateſt importance, and queſtion upon queſtion was put to the ſurgeon in every caſe, to find whether they were dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous or not. Is it poſſible that any gentleman can mean to meaſure the degree of the crime by the depth of the wound, and to argue that a man may thruſt a weapon into another's breaſt with impunity, provided he does not touch a mortal part? If this doctrine holds good, you ought to eſtabliſh ſchools of anatomy for the education of young officers, this ſcience of deſection ſhould be added to the ſkill of the fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing maſter, to train the pupils in that nicety of touch that can feel to a hair's breadth between death and life—a ſort of fiddleſtick dexterity— that can run diviſions upon veins and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and ſtop ſhort in tune and time to the thouſandth part of a ſecond. Really Gentlemen, I am not willingly ludicrous upon this ſubject, but it is impoſſible to treat ſuch an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gravely.—I diſmiſs it to my learned neighbour with one more injunction, to ſhew the Court in law that where a man paſſes a ſword with violence at another's breaſt, whether the wound is a mere puncture or goes to the hilt, the intentional guilt is the ſame. I have only one matter further to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve upon the croſs queſtioning the witneſſes —It has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps been wiſhed to inſinuate, that at the time of theſe violent proceedings there was cauſe of apprehenſion the armed troops might be ſurrounded and overcome.—The troops themſelves will hardly thank their friends for this idea—what ſhall it be alledged that the militia of America, who animated by their cauſe, have been ſelf-taught the uſe of arms? that body where every man is ſuppoſed to be in himſelf an hoſt; ſhall ſuch ſoldiers be apprehenſive of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from half their number of unarmed, mercenary, miniſterial ſlaves—for ſuch you know they think us—No Gentlemen I reject with you ſo injurious a ſuppoſition—I give credit to the ſpirit and the force of the militia—I do it ſeriouſly and upon experience—and it is upon that credit I found this propoſition that it being impoſſible the officers or ſoldiers ſhould be induced to acts of violence by any apprehenſion
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:016139_0039_0F9B780991578B70"/>
of reſiſtance;—it follows by the faireſt deduction, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was more prevalent malignity than ever appeared before in the human heart, or that the whole proceeded from direction, order, and ſyſtematical plan.</p>
               <p>Little more I imagine need be remarked to apply the evidence to the ſeveral diſtinct terms I have uſed in the charge—That the whole tenor of Col Henley's conduct was heinouſly criminal as an officer, will hardly be diſputed in a country where the principles of liberty have been ſo deeply ſtudied.—An army is not to be borne in a free ſtate, but upon the principle of defence againſt an outward enemy, or the protection of the laws.—The officer who makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the arbiter of the law is guilty of the moſt ſhameful perverſion of moral duty, and his impunity would ſcarcely be thought a very comfortable preſage of the growing li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of his country.</p>
               <p>I have alſo ſaid the Colonel's behaviour was unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man.—I will not trifle with the time or underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Court to enter into difinitions upon this term; nor will I ſhock the ears of officers nor even of the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate perſon under trial, with ſo groſs a term as the world in general apply to the act of aſſaulting a woman, a prieſt, or an unarmed man, for they are all exactly in the ſame predicament.</p>
               <p>The ſword drawn for ſuch a purpoſe is no longer the badge and diſtinction of a Gentleman; it is degraded with the implements of the aſſaſſin and hangman, and contracts a ſtain that can never be wiped away.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have now gone through the material parts of the proceedings, whether the offences are reſolved into vindictive reſentment, or more deep deſigns, or both, it muſt ſtill appear wonderful, that general maſſacre did not enſue—by the patience and diſcipline of the Britiſh ſoldiers thoſe horrors have been avoided—but whatever the eſcape may have been on our part, it is ten-fold more material on your's—we might <hi>perhaps</hi> for the ſtruggles of the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate are hard—but <hi>perhaps</hi> we might have been ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the laſt man, we ſhould thus have paid a ſoldiers debt, which we have often riſked, our fall would have been revenged, and our memories attended with pity and with honor—but for America, the tranſaction would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a foul and indeliable blot in the firſt page of her

new hiſtory; nor would any ſeries of diſavowable penitence, nor ages of rectitude in government, purity in manners, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible faith, or the whole catalogue of public virtues, have redeemed her in the opinion of mankind.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, conſider the words of the order un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which you ſit; reform the opinion of the Court of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry; and ſay whether it is the honor of Col. Henley or the honor of America, with which your minds ought to be impreſſed when they proceed to judgment in this cauſe.— I cloſe with that conſideration, as far as I can impreſs it on your breaſts—I truſt they are replete and pregnant with juſtice, honor, duty to your profeſſion; and above all with that glorious <hi>whig</hi> principle, the words of which are become almoſt a general motto in this country, and the genuine ſubſtantial practice of which I ſhall ever revere in any country, "A due ſenſe of the general rights of mankind." I truſt you have all theſe qualities, and in that perſuaſion I cannot doubt what will be the iſſue of this cauſe.</p>
               <p>Judge-Advocate.]</p>
               <p>I SHALL not now trouble the Court with any obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the evidence, becauſe at this ſtage of the trial they muſt neceſſarily be partial. After the examination of the witneſſes on the ſide of Col. Henley is finiſhed, I ſhall endeavor to lay before the Court a true ſtate of facts, from a general and aggregate view of the whole evidence; and at the ſame time ſubmit to your conſideration thoſe remarks which may conduce to elucidate and confirm them.</p>
               <p>At preſent I only renew my objection to Gen. Burgoyne's obſerving upon the evidence in defence. It is true I did not until this morning, directly oppoſe the General's claim, which is therefore called an agreement to it; if it was ſuch, it muſt have been an agreement ſubject to the opinion of the Court. It was not made a point of, and ſo paſſed off <hi>ſub ſilentio.</hi> The precedent, if it becomes one in this cauſe may hereafter be conſidered an important one; my duty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requires me to take the judgment of the Court upon the right now ſet up. I do not preſs the General upon a diſcuſſion of the queſtion to day. Any hour previous to cloſing the evidence may do as well.</p>

               <p>I do not juſt now recollect any precedent of the kind which have been enquired for by the Judge-Advocate; but I believe there have been many. Between this and the time mentioned by the Judge-Advocate I will endeavo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Col.

               <p>Major Swaſey was called in and ſworn.]</p>
               <p>Q. Was you preſent with Col. Henley at the guard-houſe on Proſpect-Hill 19th December laſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was preſent the day that the Colonel wounded Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Reeves at the guard-houſe; the day of the month I do not remember. On the forenoon of the day I attended Col. Henley to the guard-houſe, with a deſign of enquiring into the offences of a number of Britiſh ſoldiers confined there. Previous to this ſtep I had acquainted Col. Henley with General Heath's orders, which were to releaſe thoſe priſoners whoſe crimes were trifling: thoſe who had inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any inhabitant and refuſed making any atonement for the affront were to be ſent on board a guard-ſhip. When we came to the guard-houſe the priſoners were ordered out and paraded. I examined the charges of each, and finding Buchannan and Reeves, who ſtood together, were confined (Buchannan for inſulting and ſtriking an inhabitant, Reeves for inſulting an officer;) we paſſed theſe two over as not ſubjects of releaſement After learning the other priſoners offences, Reeves was called upon to relate how he got into confinement. He mentioned the circumſtances, and cloſed his narrative by repeating a low and very abuſive expreſſion, which he had made uſe of to the officer who confined him; on which I told him he was an impertinent raſcal for treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any perſon with ſuch language: He reply'd he was no more a raſcal than I was, that he was a good ſoldier. On this I order'd ſilence, and threatened if he did not ſtop his impertinence I would lay him over the head with my whip.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:016139_0042_0F9B780CA82436F0"/>
He kept on his talk and Col. Henley diſmounted his horſe, after bidding the fellow be ſilent to no purpoſe, tock a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock with a bayonet from one of the guard, and told Reeves if he ſaid another word he would run him through; Reeves replied he might do it if he pleaſed; upon this Col. Henley made a lunge at him and prick'd him in the breaſt. Reeves continuing his inſolent language, Col. Henley ſtep'd back and made a motion to cock the firelock, and told him if he was not ſilent he would blow his brains out. One of the Britiſh ſoldiers finding Reeves was not to be ſilenced, begged of the Colonel to return him to the guard-houſe. Buchannan and the other Britiſh ſoldiers begged the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel not to take notice of the affair for Reeves was drunk; on this Reeves damn'd them and ſaid he was not drunk He was ordered into the guard-houſe. I do not remember that much ſwearing paſſed, nor can I recollect the words of inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence uſed by Reeves. After Col. Henley had prick'd him, Reeves ſaid he was a good ſoldier and he would fight for his king and country as long as he had breath and hoped that he ſhould ſoon be with Gen. Howe that he might ſeek revenge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that Col. Henley's intention in making the paſs at Reeves was to injure or to frighten him into ſilence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Only to ſilence him; for had the Colonel extended his arm he might have run him through with the bayonet.</p>
               <p>Q. By Gen. Burgoyne.—Did you hear Col. Henley or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any of the guard to run Reeves through the body before he diſmounted from his horſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not; but he might have done it.</p>
               <p>Q In what poſition was Col. Henley when he made the paſs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He had his right hand on the butt of the firelock, and the left graſping the ſtock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Reeves apologize to Col. Henley for inſulting the officer?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He ſaid he did not know him to be an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not think Reeves's inſolence of language as much directed to yourſelf as to Col. Henley?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It was before the Colonel prick'd him</p>
               <p>Q. By what rule do you judge of inſolence of language when you do not remember the words?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By the manner.</p>

                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:016139_0043_0F9B780D402CCCC0"/>Q. Did Reeves throw out ony reflections upon America, or the perſons concerned in the cauſe of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He did not that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you conſider Reeves's ſaying he would fight for his king and country as part of the inſolence you mention?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not; Col. Henley in reply damn'd Gen. Howe or his king and country, and told him no body blamed him for fighting in the cauſe he had engaged in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ſee any reſiſtance made, or any mark of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience on the part of Reeves to the Colonel's orders, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his not being ſilent?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There was no other order given; Reeves made no open reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Q. In going down to the guard houſe did Col. Henley expreſs ſatisfaction at having it in his power to releaſe the Britiſh priſoners?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He did.</p>

               <p>Q. DID you ſee Colonel Henley at the guard-houſe on proſpect-hill 19th December laſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did; I had the command of the guard that day. Col. Henley and Major Swaſey came to the guard-houſe and enquired what number of priſoners I had in cuſtody, and ordered them paraded; they were accordingly drawn up in a ſingle line, Reeves was on the right and Buchannan next to him. The Colonel mildly asked the priſoners why they would get into difficulties? I handed the charges againſt them to Major Swaſey, and as he read over their names and offences, the Colonel ſpoke to each one upon the ſubject of his confinement. When he came to Reeves he obſerved to him that he was the lad who abuſed the officer down in town; Reeves ſaid he did not know him to be an officer at the time. Major Swaſey told him that if he had been the officer, he
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:016139_0044_0F9B78111D1FCF80"/>
ſhould have taken his ſatisfaction on the ſpot. Col. Henley then told Reeves he was a raſcal; Reeves replied I am no raſcal but a tree Briton, and by God I will ſtand up for my king and country 'till I die. The Colonel told him he was a good fellow to ſtand up for his king and country, that he did not blame him, but he muſt be ſilent. Reeves kept on talking; the Colonel ordered ſilence, and turned to Buchannan. The Major went on to read his crime, and Buchannan was making an excuſe for his conduct; Reeves continued talking and ſwearing, and turned round to Buchannan and ſaid damn you why don't you ſtand up for your king and country; Buchannan deſired him to be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et; Reeves anſwered God damn them all, I'll ſtand up for my king and country while I have life; if I had my arms I would ſoon be with Gen. Howe, and be revenged on them. Upon this Col. Henley got from his horſe and took a gun from one of the guard with a fixed bayonet, and brought it up towards Reeves's breaſt, and made a puſh at him, and ſaid you raſcal if you don't hold your tongue I will run the bayonet through you; Reeves ſtepped one foot back, and ſaid he would ſtand up for his king and country, and if you have a mind to kill me you may. The Colonel brought up the piece again, and Reeves repeating the ſame words, the Colonel exclaim'd God damn your king and country, if you do not hold your tongue I will run you through the body: Buchannan then took hold of the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, and Col. Henley bid him keep his diſtance. Finding Reeves was not to be quieted, I deſired the Colonel to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commit him, and he was remanded to the guard-houſe. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was in the guard-houſe, he looked out of the window and kept talking and ſwearing while Col. Henley was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing the other priſoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ſuppoſe Col. Henley in the paſs he made at Reeves intended to wound or only to ſilence him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Only to ſilence him; the Colonel ſpake very mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 'till Reeves ſaid "God damn them all."</p>
               <p>Q. Did Col. Henley diſmiſs the reſt of the priſoners with a mild reproof?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Col. Henley do all he could to ſatisfy the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners before he diſmiſſed them?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:016139_0045_0F9B78125BD07FA8"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; he mildly cautioned them, and told Buchannan he would releaſe him after he had wrote to the inhabitant who bad been abuſed.</p>
               <p>Q. If Reeves had not ſtept back do you think the bayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net would have gone into his body?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I do not think it would.</p>
               <p>Q. By General Burgoyne.—Is it uſual in the American ſervice to ſilence men by the ſword and bayonet?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, it is not; but when the temper is raiſed a man will do that which at another time he would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Col Henley order any of the guard to run Reeves through the body, before he got from his horſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not hear him; he might poſſibly have ordered it, but I was very near to him.</p>
               <p>Corporal John Deane of the militia]</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the guard-houſe on 19th of December laſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was. The witneſs confirms the teſtimony of Capt. Wild, as to the priſoners being paraded, and ſays that when Col. Henley aſked Reeves what he was confined for, Reeves replied he was confined for talking ſaucy to a Lieutenant, but did not at the time know him to be an officer. Col. Henley inquired what the abuſe was; Reeves anſwered that if he muſt tell, he muſt—"That he was walking along with a comrade, who told him that King Hancock was come to town, upon which I ſaid don't you think him an impudent fellow for coming ſo near Gen. Burgoyne. A Continental officer aſked me what it was I ſaid, I replied if you want any thing of me here is my paſs. The officer told me I had better not talk ſo ſaucy, and I bid him kiſs my arſe." Upon hearing this account, Major Swaſey told Reeves that if he had given him ſuch a reply he would have ſettled it with him on the ſpot, and not ſent for a file of men—Col. Henley added ſo would I you raſcal Reeves anſwered he was no raſcal; the Colonel told him he was one; Reeves then ſaid if I am a raſcal, you are a damn'd raſcal. Upon this Col. Henley got off his horſe, took a firelock from one of the guard, and bid Reeves be ſilent, and came up to him with the fixed bayonet—Reeves bared his breaſt and told the Colonel that his life was at ſtake, and he might take it. Upon this the Colonel prick'd him with the bayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:016139_0046_0F9B781396ACEA98"/>
but I ſaw no blood run; and then ordered him into the guard-houſe without making another paſs at him that I ſaw.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the whole of Reeves's conduct inſolent and ſaucy?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It was; and had I been Col. Henley I ſhould have thought ſo.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the words "damnd raſcal" paſs from Reeves before the Colonel got off his horſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They did.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to Reeves when he made uſe of thoſe words?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> About two rods.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you looking at Corporal Reeves at the time he made uſe of thoſe words?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was looking at the Colonel and Reeves at the ſame time and I am poſitive it was Reeves who uſed the words.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Major Swaſey nearer Col. Henley and Reeves than yourſelf?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I don't know; there were ſome perſons nearer, but I don't know who; ſome were Britiſh ſoldiers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ſee Corporal Buchannan, or any other Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſoldier take hold of the firelock in Col. Henley's hands?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Capt. Wild adviſe Col. Henley to ſend Reeves to the guard-houſe?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after Col. Henley prick'd Reeves before he ordered him into the guard-houſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It was five or ſix minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What paſs'd in that time?</p>

               <p>Elijah Horton.]</p>
               <p>Q. WAS you at the guard-houſe 19th December, when Col. Henley was there?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was preſent, being one of the guard; Col. Henley and Major Swaſey came down and after inquiring into the number of priſoners, ordered them out. The witneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the teſtimony of Corporal Deane, and ſays that upon Col. Henley's calling Reeves a raſcal, Reeves replied if I am a raſcal, you are a damn'd raſcal; and that this was before Col. Henley got off his horſe.</p>
               <p>Q Did you hear Col. Henley order one of the guard to run Reeves through before he got off his horſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not; and my ſituation was ſuch that if Col. Henley had given ſuch an order I muſt have heard it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about three yards diſtance.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did Col. Henley bid Reeves be ſilent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he prick'd him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I heard him two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. When Col. Henley made a paſs at Reeves did it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you that Col. Henley intended rather to ſilence him than to puniſh him by wounding him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It did appear ſo; for Col. Henley might eaſily have wounded or killed him, had he been diſpoſed ſo to do; the Colonel puſh'd moderately, Reeves drew back his body. The puſh was not ſufficient to have forced the bayonet through a thick woolen cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. By Gen. Burgoyne. —Did you ſee Corporal Buchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan or any Britiſh ſoldier take hold of the firelock to prevent Col. Henley's making a ſecond paſs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Col. Henley reply to Reevss, damn your king and country?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not; and if he had ſaid it I think I was ſo near I muſt have heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was Major Swaſey to Col. Henley when he ſtabb'd Reeves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Col. Henley's horſe was between him and Major Swaſey, who was on horſe-back.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="unknown:016139_0048_0F9B7814C06FA9F0"/>Silas Morſe confirms the ſubſtance of Corporal Deane's teſtimony, as to his narration.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Reeves ſtep back when Col. Henley made the paſs at him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He moved one foot back.</p>
               <p>Q. By the Court.—It Reeves had not ſtep'd back, wou'd Col. Henley have wounded him deeply?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; for Col. Henley did not inſtantly puſh at him on his ſtepping back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Col. Henley draw back the bayonet on finding it touch Reeves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Col. Henley ſay to Reeves damn your king and country?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not; and was ſo near him at the time he got off his horſe I ſhould have heard him had he ſaid ſo.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ſee Corporal Buchannan or any other Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſoldier take hold of the firelock in Col. Henley's hands?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Major Swaſey or any body elſe, adviſe Col. Henley to ſend Reeves to the guard-room?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not.</p>
               <p>James Brazier confirms the teſtimony of Horton and Morſe, both in the narrative and in the anſwers to the ſame queſtions.</p>
               <p>Wadſworth Horton confirms the narrative of Brazier, word for word; and adds that Col. Henley firſt call'd Reeves a raſcal, Reeves reply'd God damn you, don't call me a raſcal.</p>
               <p>John Barry confirms the teſtimony of Horton and Morſe, and of Wadſworth Horton, except that he did not hear Reeves ſay to Col. Henley God damn you, don't call me a raſcal.</p>

               <p>John Kittle, ſerjeant in the militia.]</p>
               <p>Q. WAS you one of the detachment ordered to Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect hill on the forenoon of the 8th January?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was; we marched from the North ſide of Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill up to Proſpect-hill. When we were going up Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect-hill the Britiſh ſoldiers crowded much upon us; the ſerjeants were obliged to fall into the ranks and exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to keep the Britiſh ſoldiers off, they would not tho' repeatedly ordered, move out of the way; I thought they deſerved ſtabbing, as they would not go out of the way when they were ordered. I ſaw one of our ſerjeants with his gun and fixed bayonet over his arm make a puſh at a Britiſh ſoldier, and I believe ſtabb'd him, and then ſaid to the Britiſh ſoldier do you damn me? and then turn'd his firelock and ſtruck him with the butt of it; we kept on marching and I ſaw no more of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Britiſh ſoldiers inſult the party as they march'd along?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We were inſulted by their crowding on us, laughing and ſneering at the guard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other object to excite their attention?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, not that I know, of; and their looks in general were directed to the guard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your own opinion that you, had a right to ſtab the Britiſh ſoldiers who did not get out of your way, or was you told ſo by any other perſon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It was my own opinion intirely.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ſee any Britiſh ſoldier with a club, ſtone, or other weapon in his hand, or any attack or aſſault made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the guard, or other inſult offered except that of laughing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; except that of crowding on us.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the number of Britiſh ſoldiers that crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round you?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Three hundred at leaſt in my opinion; I ſaw no Britiſh officer near.</p>
               <p>Thomas Duckenfield of the militia.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you one of the detachment ordered to Proſpect-hill on the 8th January.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="unknown:016139_0050_0F9B78166B953230"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was; as we marched along towards the fort on Proſpect-hill, the Britiſh ſoldiers crowded much upon us, ſo as not to give us elbow-room; it was very muddy; our ſerjeant ſpoke to the Britiſh ſoldiers and deſired them to give way for us to paſs, but they crowded cloſe upon us; a Britiſh ſoldier then deſired them to move back, upon which one of the Britiſh ſoldiers ſaid damn the yankies; upon that our ſerjeant aſked him what he ſaid, and he repeated damn the yankies; with that the ſerjeant made a puſh at him, whether he wounded him or not I can't ſay, but the man cried out. The ſerjeant then clubb'd his firelock, and the Britiſh ſoldiers crowding in, he made a ſtroke at the ſame man, but did not ſtrike him I am certain, I was quite cloſe to him all the time; we marched on.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you interrupted or impeded by the Britiſh ſoldiers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We were; for they crowded ſo upon us as to break our ranks ſeveral times.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you inſulted by the Britiſh ſoldiers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They crowded ſo upon us that they forced us into the mud and water, and would not give way?</p>
               <p>Q. Did they laugh at or hoot at the guard?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They did laugh at us.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Britiſh ſoldiers were round you?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> Four or five hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ſee any Britiſh ſoldier with a club or other weapon in his hand?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not.</p>
               <p>John Anderſon of the militia.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you one of the detachment ſent to Proſpect hill on the 8th January?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was. The witneſs confirms the evidence of Duck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingfield, except that he did not hear the Britiſh ſoldiers ſay damn the yankies. They made uſe of the words damn, but who they damn'd he can't tell; he was within three feet of the ſerjeant when he made the paſs at the Britiſh ſoldier. The witneſs gives the ſame anſwer in ſubſtance to the queſtions put to the laſt witneſs, except that there were in his opinion between two and three hundred Britiſh ſoldiers around the party.</p>
               <p>Captain Dodge of the militia.]</p>
               <p>Q. Was you Captain of the detachment that was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Proſpect-hill on the 8th January?</p>

                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:016139_0051_0F9B781A45951B90"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> On the 8th January an order came for Col. Gerriſh to furniſh a detachment of 100 men from his regiment, which was made, and the command given to me, with verbal orders to reinforce the main guard on Proſpect-hill. We marched on, myſelf at the head of the party, and during the march I ſaw no inſult, I looked directly forward. When we came a-breaſt of the barracks, the Britiſh ſoldiers turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out generally. As we marched on they followed. In the front I ſaw no inſult offered by the Britiſh ſoldiers; how it was in the rear I cannot ſay, but I had no report of any at the time of the march. Juſt before I came up to the barracks, I halted the men, in order to cloſe and cover properly; and then gave orders that they gave no inſult nor received any?</p>

               <p>Aſa Peirce of the militia.]</p>
               <p>Q. WAS you one of the guard who had a Britiſh ſoldier in cuſtody, carrying him to the guard-houſe on the 8th January?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was; in the forenoon orders came to the ſerjeant of our guard to furniſh a file of men and a corporal to take charge of a Britiſh ſoldier, of which I was one; we took him at the bridge juſt below the proviſion houſe. Col. Henley when we took charge of the priſoner was by, and gave us orders if any man attempted to reſcue him, to fire upon them. We marched on with him, (his name was Buchannan) he told us he had done nothing more than hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a paſs that was not his own, that he ſhould not be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed, and that one of us wou'd be ſufficient to guard him. Juſt as we got within the works behind the barracks, where there was a conſiderable number of Britiſh ſoldiers collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; a Britiſh ſoldier came up to us upon the run<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I told him to keep off, he muttered ſomething and told me if I did not mind he would take my firelock from me. Our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral told him if he did not mind how he talked he would
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:016139_0052_0F9B781B6DB6D1E0"/>
take care of him. On this he ſtepped aſide and walked along with us talking with Buchannan upon the ſubject of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement; as we went along we came up to a crowd of Britiſh ſoldiers, I ſhould think three or four hundred of them; our corporal ordered them to make way, which they refuſed to do, and ſtood ſo thick together that we could hardly tell which the priſoner was. The priſoner ſtep'd out and another Britiſh ſoldier ſtep'd in, took hold of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>channan's arm, and placed himſelf between me &amp; Buchannan who went off with the crowd; our corporal turning round and ſeeing Buchannan gone ſtep'd in among the Britiſh ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to recover Buchannan; the ſame Britiſh ſoldier who had taken hold of Buchannan's arm, took hold of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and ſtop'd him; upon this I brought my piece down and prick'd the ſoldier who had hold of the corporal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the hip and the ribbs. The ſoldier then let go the Corporal's arm, and we marched on to the main-guard without our priſoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Britiſh ſoldiers refuſe by words or actions to make way for the guard to paſs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By actions; I mean they did not move out of the way; they talked, but I don't recollect what they ſaid.</p>
               <p>Q. After Buchannan had eſcaped from the guard did the Britiſh ſoldiers ſhew any marks of triumph?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; they laugh'd and huzza'd a good deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the name of the perſon whom you pricked?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I do not</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you run the Britiſh ſoldier into the body?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I imagine I did, for I puſh'd with a good will, and he cried out God damn you.</p>
               <p>Thomas Lewis of the militia.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you one of the guard who had the cuſtody of a Britiſh ſoldier on the 8th January?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was. The witneſs confirms the ſubſtance of Peirce's teſtimony, except that he did not ſee a Britiſh ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier take hold of Buchannan nor the corporal</p>
               <p>Q. Might a Britiſh ſoldier have taken hold of Buchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan or the corporal, and you not ſee it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; for upon Buchannan's ſtepping out I turned round to keep the Britiſh ſoldiers off on the other ſide of us,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:016139_0053_0F9B781CB7282DA0"/>
and hearing a Britiſh ſoldier cry out I turned back and ſaw Peirce pulling back his bayonet from the ſide of a Britiſh ſoldier.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that the priſoner (Buchannan) was forced away by the Britiſh ſoldiers, or that he run away himſelf?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I can't ſay, for it was done very quick; Buchannan ſtarted before I turned round.</p>
               <p>Q. After Buchannan had got away did the Britiſh ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhew marks of triumph?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They ſhouted and huzza'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ſee Col. Henley at any time during this tranſaction?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I ſaw an officer who I think was Col. Henley on the fort, his head above the breaſt-work, at about five rods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>It is conceded by Gen. Burgoyne that on the evening of the 7th of January, a provincial ſentry was knock'd down on his poſt by a Britiſh ſoldier; that he was much beat, and his gun taken from him.</p>
               <p>Col. Gerriſh of the militia.]</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of a Provincial ſentry being knocked down on his poſt on the evening of 7th January, and what tranſactions enſued?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In the evening of 7th of January, a meſſenger came to me at Winter-hill, where my regiment is poſted, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me that a ſentry had been knocked down on his poſt, and his gun taken from him. In conſequence of this report, I ordered the regiment out and detached 200 men, with two Captains as a reinforcement to the guard at the French lines on Proſpect-hill, with orders to march ſilently and ſurround the firſt row of barracks, where I ſuppoſed the gun was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in. I accompanied the detachment. The party was in two diviſions, one under Capt. Huſe, the other under Capt. Kimbal. I left the party under Capt. Huſe in front of the firſt row of barracks, and then ordered Capt. Kimbal (who had miſtaken my firſt orders and got to a wrong ſituation) to join Capt, Huſe; while Capt Kimbal marched to make the junction, I was left a little behind in front of the ſecond row of barracks, a Britiſh ſoldier came out and ſaid to me, damn you what do you come here for, we have done you no hurt in theſe barracks: We have got arms and we will
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:016139_0054_0F9B781D049A40D0"/>
ſhoot you. I then thought the ſentry's gun might be in that barrack, and called for a ſerjeant and a dozen men; they came up, then the Britiſh ſoldiers came to the door of the barrack and preſented a weapon out (I thought it had been a muſket, tho' I afterwards found it had only been a club) and ſaid God damn you we'll ſhoot ye. I then ordered my ſmall party to fire upon them, but upon the party's cocking I re-called the order, as the Britiſh ſoldiers in the room might not all be guilty, and ſome of my own men might be endangered who were in the rear of the barrack. We then approached cloſe to the door and found that they were not guns which the ſoldiers in the room had in their hands. One of them as we approached made a ſtroke at us with a ſtick, but did not hit either of us; as he was making another paſs I ſtruck him down, and we entered the barrack and took five or ſix of thoſe in the room and ſent them off to the main-guard. I then got a candle and ſearch'd the room, found no arms, but a number of hickery-ſticks, ſhorter and ſtouter than walking ſticks. When the ſearch was over, one of the Britiſh ſoldiers catched at the candle and put it out and followed us to the other barrack, where he was inſolent and ſaucy, and I thought proper to ſend him to the guard-houſe. I then gave orders to the Britiſh ſoldiers that they ſhould not leave the barracks 'till the barracks were ſearched, telling them they ſhould not be moleſted by my men. I then ſearch'd the barracks where I ſuppoſed the gun was carried in; they were loth the barracks ſhould be ſearched, and refuſed giving me any direct anſwers; they were inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and kept damning of us, ſeveral of them called us damn'd rebels and yankies ſeveral times; this gave me ſtrong reaſons of ſuſpicion that the gun was ſecreted among them, and I therefore thought proper to ſend the greater part of thoſe in that room to the main-guard. I then went on and ſearched ſeveral rooms in the ſame row of barracks, and met with no oppoſition or inſult. Finding the ſearch fruitleſs, I returned with my detachment to Winter-hill, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a party I left to reinforce the guard at the French lines.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you with Col. Gerriſh on the evening of 7th January, when the barracks on Proſpect-hill were ſearched by him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> After the detachment had got down to the barracks as hath been related, Col. Gerriſh gave orders to a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and four men to go in and ſearch the rooms: I was one of the four. We ſearched ſeveral rooms in the moſt northerly row of the barracks, and met with no reſiſtance from the Britiſh ſoldiers. We then went to the barracks in the row below. When we came to the door of the room intended to be ſearched, ſome one in the room called out to the reſt to fire; a weapon was preſented out of the door, whether it was a gun or a ſtick I can't ſay; the Britiſh ſoldiers ſaid they would defend their own room. On this Col. Gerriſh ordered Lieut. Searle to fire upon them, but preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called the word: Four or five of us then ruſhed in among them, they were armed with clubs, we turned them out of the room, and one of them made a ſtroke at Lieut. Searle, which he parry'd with his gun, Lieut. Searle then knocked three or four of them down with his gun: We had then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to take five of them to the guard-houſe, one without
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:016139_0056_0F9B781E85A0A0C8"/>
his breeches. The Britiſh ſoldiers were inſolent and ſaid to us damn your bloods, you ſhall not come in; and the firſt that does we'll knock him down. I did not hear any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of yankies or rebels. In another room into which I went with a Lieutenant, as ſoon as we entered the door a Britiſh ſoldier blew out the light they had in the room; the Lieut. ſeized the man by the collar who blew out the candle, and brought him out of the room with ſome difficulty, and aſked him for the candle, which he denied to have ſeen or touched, an officer of ours put his hand into his pocket and took it out, and then the Captain ſtruck him, then the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutant, and then the Colonel, who call'd him raſcal for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying his having the candle, and ordered him under guard. We went to ſeveral other rooms, where the Britiſh ſoldiers held the light for us, and aſſiſted us in ſearching the room; the ſearch was fruitleſs, for we could not find the gun.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any fire-arms in any of the rooms you ſearched?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There was not; in one room they had clubs, I mean hickery ſticks, three or four feet long, and near as thick as my wriſt.</p>
               <p>Q. When you ruſh'd into the room did the Britiſh ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſtrike at you with their clubs; and how many Britiſh ſoldiers were in the room?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There were about 16 or 18 ſoldiers in the room, and they did not ſtrike at us when we went into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there time for the man who was without his breeches to have put them on if he choſe it before he was carried off by the guard?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There was; ſeveral of the others went in and put on their ſtockings. This man was ſulkey, and I ſuppoſe he meant to knock ſome of us down before he put his breeches on, as he came out of the room with his club.</p>
               <p>Col. Eleazer Brooks.]</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any report to Col. Henley on the morning of the 8th January?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did to the beſt of my remembrance in the following words:—"Sir, before I make my report as an officer of the day, (yeſterday) I thought it my duty to inform you that one of your ſentries was laſt night knock'd down, and his gun taken from him; that Col Gerriſh in attempting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the gun was reſiſted with clubs, &amp;c. That about 20
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:016139_0057_0F9B781F45DC07D0"/>
of the Britiſh ſoldiers were confined for this affair. I am this moment informed that two of our men were killed laſt night, whether it be true or not I can't ſay."</p>
               <p>Q. By Col. Henley.—Had you orders to get your regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under arms?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The regiment were, I believe, got under arms imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and ſoon after diſmiſſed; but I was not with them.</p>
               <p>Col. Gerriſh.—I was at Col. Henley's on the morning of the 8th January, and as I came along I ſaw Col. Brooks's regiment upon the common under arms; I was told that a hundred men had been ordered from my regiment, I aſk'd the reaſon, 'twas anſwered—there were two of our men kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, I reply'd I believe it is a falſe report, for I had been on the Hill that morning and had heard nothing of it; upon that Col. Brooks's regiment was diſmiſſed. Col Henley immediately went to Proſpect-hill—ſoon after I went to the Hill myſelf, as I was officer of the day.—When I entered the fort on Proſpect-hill I ſaw Col. Henley with the rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement from my regiment; Col. Henley told me the Britiſh ſoldiers had reſcued a priſoner from our guard; I then went in front of the detachment from my regiment with Col. Henley, I ſaw about a hundred Britiſh ſoldiers front of the detachment, between it and the barracks, the diſtance was ſo ſmall between the detachment and barracks, that 'twas difficult paſſing without interruption on account of their being in front; I apprehend about 200 more Britiſh ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were diſperſed about, particularly in the rear of the detachment. I think I told Col. Henley if I had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand I ſhould order them to diſperſe, as I did not look on the guard ſafe; I thought they might diſarm his guard if they ſhould ruſh upon them. I went immediately into the citadel, and ſaw nothing further. When I came out of the citadel into the fort again, I ſaw Col. Henley marching off the Hill with the detachment and the priſoners; as they were marching off, a number of Britiſh ſoldiers ſtanding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſaid, I wonder what the damn'd Yankies are going to do now.</p>
               <p>Q. When Col. Henley converſed with you, did any of the Britiſh ſoldiers come cloſe up and liſten to what was ſaid?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They did; We moved a little farther and they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us with a view, as I thought, of hearing the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I don't recollect Col. Henley's ſaying any thing to them about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="unknown:016139_0058_0F9B78200E7F6530"/>Q. By General Phillips.— How long was you with Col. Henley in the front of the detachment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> About four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Britiſh ſoldiers crowd ſo much upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment as to prevent the execution of any orders which Col. Henley might give?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They did; and it would have been impoſſible for the detachment to have formed a manoeuvre without the Britiſh ſoldier's removing.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you ſtood with Col. Henley by the detachment, was there any words or actions on the part of the Britiſh ſoldiers that menaced any aſſault on Col. Henley or the detachment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I heard no words except a laughing and talking among them; I ſaw no appearance of an aſſault on the guard ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their crowding upon the guard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ſee any weapons whatever in the hands of the Britiſh ſoldiers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ſee Col. Henley on Proſpect-hill on the forenoon of the 8th January?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did; I was the Captain of the guard on the Hill that day, and had in cuſtody twenty-nine Britiſh ſoldiers. About 11 o'clock Col. Henley and Major Swaſey came up to the guard-houſe, and after ſome inquiries, and my reporting that every thing was very quiet, Col Henley told me that a reinforcement was coming up, and he thought it would be beſt to take the priſoners out of the guard-houſe, and ſend them to Cambridge, where an enquiry could beſt be made into their crimes. We went into the guard-houſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and preſently the detachment came into the citadel, and formed about four rods from the guard-houſe. At this time I ſaw a large number of Britiſh ſoldiers collecting near a corner of the guard houſe. I went with Col. Henley's orders to bid them diſperſe and retire to their barracks, he ordered them two or three times, finding they would not obey him, he called twelve men from the detachment. After ſome time the twelve men moved from the party, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Britiſh ſoldiers gave a ſhout and diſperſed, going off towards their barracks. Immediately on this, a man came up and told Col. Henley that a priſoner had been
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:016139_0059_0F9B775F5FF70B60"/>
reſcued from him by the Britiſh ſoldiers. Col. Henley on this ſaid he would take the command himſelf; and then marched the detachment out of the citadel and paraded them in the rear of the barracks in the fort. I know of no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions while the detachment were in the fort, for as Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the main-guard I could not quit my poſt at ſuch a time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the number of Britiſh ſoldiers who were aſſembled near the corner of the guard-houſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I believe near three hundred, and more were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting when they diſperſed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any inſult offered to Col. Henley by the Britiſh ſoldiers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not perſonally to Col. Henley; but they were laughing and jeering at the guard; ſome of them cried out Yankies, but I can't be particular in their expreſſions.</p>
               <p>Q. By Gen. Burgoyne.—Was there any appearance of an aſſault on the part of the Britiſh ſoldiers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; they appeared to me rather with a view of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting than aſſaulting the guard; they pointed at and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the guard; they were talking but I did not hear their expreſſions; there was a breaſt-work between the Britiſh ſoldiers and the detachment, over which they were looking at the detachment</p>
               <p>Q. Had the Britiſh ſoldiers any weapons in their hands?</p>

               <p>Q. DO you know any thing of corporal Buchannan a Britiſh ſoldier, being taken into cuſtody on the 8th January, and his being reſcued from the guard who had charge of him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> On the morning of the 8th January I was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Col. Henley to Proſpect-hill. At the bridge on the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:016139_0060_0F9B775C59C75D80"/>
road to Proſpect-hill the ſentry was examining a paſs ſhewed hint by corporal Buchannan; Col. Henley ſuſpecting the paſs might be forged, ordered Buchannan to ſhew it to him, with much reluctance be gave it to Col. Henley; the name of another man inſerted in it; in conſequence of this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Col. Henley ordered a file of men to take charge of him: As there had been frequent reſcues before, Col. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley ordered the guard in caſe any Britiſh ſoldiers ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to reſcue him out of their hands to fire upon them. I then went on with Col. Henley to the guard-houſe on Proſpect-hill Soon after we got upon the hill a detachment which had been ordered up to take charge of ſome priſoners in the main-guard arrived; after the detachment had paraded near the guard-houſe, a large body of Britiſh ſoldiers appeared near the breaſt-work who were ordered to their barrack by an officer, and then by Col. Henley; they appeared to move ſlowly off At this time I ſtep'd up to the breaſt-work, and obſerved Buchannan coming up with the guard; the guard had got into a crowd of Britiſh ſoldiers, and I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Britiſh ſoldier hold of the ſkirts of the coat of one of the guard, and heard ſome amongſt the crowd cry out, run damn you run, and ſaw Buchannan running through the crowd of the Britiſh ſoldiers: one of the guard purſuing him with a charg'd bayonet, was intercepted by the crowd, and I ſaw no more of Buchannan. Immediately on this Col. Henley ordered the whole of the detachment to march out of the fort, and we went out of the fort together, and Col. Henley aſked me what meaſures he ſhould take to recover Buchannan? I obſerved to him the beſt way would be to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Britiſh commanding-officer of the day of it, and did not doubt he would give Buchannan up. Col. Henley then deſired me to wait on the commanding-officer and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with the matter; I accordingly weired on Major Foſter of the 21ſt regiment, and on acquainting him with the matter, the Major told me he would ſend for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutant of the regiment and order him confined, and report the matter to the Brigadier. In ſix or ſeven minutes I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Col. Henley and reported Major Foſter's anſwer, with which he ſeemed perfectly ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>Q What number of Britiſh ſoldiers were aſſembled at the time Buchannan was reſcued?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I imagine one hundred and fifty, within a circle of one hundred yards.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ſee Col. Henley with a detachment of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers on Proſpect-hill, on the 8th January laſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was at the guard-houſe on Proſpect-hill, on the forenoon of the 8th January, when Col. Henley and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Swaſey rode up, and ſoon after a detachment came up and were paraded near the guard houſe; at this time a number of Britiſh ſoldiers made their appearance out-ſide the breaſt-work, near the guard-houſe; orders were repeatedly given to them by the Captain of the guard and by Col. Henley to diſperſe, which they paid little regard to. There were about one hundred at the bread-work,and more were coming up; at this time I ſaw two or three of our men armed, coming through the Britiſh ſoldiers; Col. Henley called out for a dozen men, upon which the Britiſh ſoldiers gave a ſhout and moved towards the barracks, and on their way ruſhed between the two or three armed men before-mentioned, and there was a ſcuffle among them as they cleared away; I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Britiſh ſoldier by his clapping his hand near his hip, was wounded. Col. Henley ſoon marched out with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, and paraded them in the rear of the barracks; I followed and ſtood in the rear of the guard near the centre. As ſoon as the detachment halted the Britiſh ſoldiers ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered round in front and rear of the detachment, to the amount of upwards of two hundred. On this Col. Henley ordered twelve men on the right to prime and load, and then wheeled them to the left ſo as to form an angle. Col. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley then turned towards the Britiſh ſoldiers and ſaid that he had had one priſoner reſcued, and if they offered to reſcue any more he would order his guard to fire upon them. Col. Henley aſked for Major Swaſey, and ſeeing Col. Gerriſh on horſe-back, he ſtepped up to him, two or three Britiſh ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers followed him and ſtood at two or three yards diſtance liſtening (to appearance) to what was ſaid by Col. Henley and Col. Gerriſh. Col. Henley then ordered a diviſion from the left of the detachment to go into the citadel and bring out ſome priſoners; they marched off accordingly, and were about one fourth of the whole detachment. Col. Henley then diſpoſed his men to receive the priſoners which might be brought; by this time the Britiſh ſoldiers had collected in ſuch numbers, that the Colonel had hardly room to paſs in front of his guard; Col. Henley then addreſſed the Britiſh
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:016139_0062_0F9B775E87D7D3E8"/>
ſoldiers, and ordered them to diſperſe and go their barracks, ſome few turned round, Col. Henley repeated his orders and ſaid begone to your barracks every one of you; ſome others then turned round and moved ſlowly, Col. Henley on their moving ſlowly, cry'd God damn you why don't you move, and made a lunge with his ſword at a Britiſh ſoldier, which I imagine ſtruck him, as I obſerved the ſword was bent, and ſaw the Colonel endeavor to ſtraighten it. They then moved off, and the men returned from the guard-houſe with the Britiſh priſoners, and the whole detachment march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off the hill with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any Britiſh ſoldier ſay any thing to Col. Henley during any of the time you have ſpoken of?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not; there was a buzzing amongſt them, but I can't repeat any expreſſion they uſed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any of the Britiſh ſoldiers any weapons in their hands?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not that I ſaw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you obſerve any circumſtance to prevent Col. Henley from taking any of the Britiſh ſoldiers priſoners had he thought proper?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He might have taken the man priſoner whom he ſtruck at with the ſword.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he not have taken any other man priſoner?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He might have taken a ſingle man; it might have been dangerous taking more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man Col. Henley made the lunge at moving off at the time?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I think he was not; he ſtood with his face towards the guard, at the diſtance of a yard or two.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Col. Henley do after making the lunge you have mentioned?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He turned round and walked in the front of his guard towards the right, and ſpoke to a Britiſh ſoldier who was walking very ſlowly in front of the guard, and bid him go along immediately, he repeated the order, the ſoldier did not in the leaſt quicken his pace; Col. Henley followed him a little way and then turned round; the Britiſh ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er attempted to paſs the ſerjeant who ſtood on the right of the guard, the ſerjeant puſh'd him off the bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ſee Col. Henley make a paſs at this laſt ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier you have mentioned?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was; after the detachment got into the citadel and were paraded I obſerved a number of Britiſh ſoldiers look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the breaſt-work; Col. Henley ordered them to diſperſe, they did not ſeem to move, he ordered them a ſecond time, they did not move, Col. Henley turned round and ordered twelve men to advance, I was one of the twelve, we advanced out to the ſally-port, Col. Henley or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered us to go on, the Britiſh ſoldiers ſeeing us advance ſcattered ſlowly; ſoon after Col. Henley came up and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with us to the rear of the barrack, we were there paraded with the reſt of the detachment; Col. Henley or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered twelve men to load, he then ſaid he had had one pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner reſcuſed, and determined not to have another, and ordered the Britiſh ſoldiers to diſperſe, they moved very ſlowly, he walked along the guard and back again, and ſaid to two of the Britiſh ſoldiers damn you do you want to be run through, and bid them be gone, and turned round, one of the Britiſh ſaid he'd be damn'd if he was in any hurry, I don't know that the Colonel heard him; the two ſoldiers went on ſlowly, and when they came to the right of the detachment, they attempted to crowd by the ſerjeant who puſh'd them both over the bank, they got up and damn'd the ſerjeant, and look'd black and ſour as the devil at him; I did not ſee Col. Henley ſtab a Britiſh ſoldier, I ſtood ſo far on the right that I could not ſee all that paſſed; the Britiſh ſoldiers did not crowd on the right of the guard, they were pretty thick on the left; I imagine upon the whole parade there might be three or four hundred Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſoldiers.</p>

Capt. Brooks going towards the North-weſt part, where a number of Britiſh ſoldiers were aſſembled; Col. Henley had his ſword in his hand and drawn, he repeatedly ordered them to diſperſe and immediately ordered a ſerjeant and twelve men from my detachment; ſoon after the twelve men had marched as I ſuppoſe out of the citadel, Col. Henley came and took the command of the detachment and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them out of the citadel, the ſerjeant and twelve men mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched as a van-guard, ſo far as to have room to parade; the twelve men formed a rank intire, and formed ah angle on the right; Col. Henley then walked up and down the front of the detachment, and immediately addreſſing himſelf to the Britiſh ſoldiers, ſaid, you have reſcued one priſoner, but you ſhall not reſcue another, Col. Henley at this time had is ſword drawn, but I am uncertain when he drew it, as he walked to the right where there was not ſo many Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſoldiers as on the left, he aſked one or two of them a queſtion, what it was I cannot tell, but think it imply'd do you want me to force you off; with that they went off ſlowly, three of them than attempted to get <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Henley was walking up and down the parade, the Britiſh troops came up thick in the front of us, Col. Henley ordered them to diſperſe and go to their barracks, they made no movement at this order; Col. Henley then moved to the left 80 or a 100 paces and looking round, found they had not moved, came back again and ordered them to go off; on this they turned and began moving very ſlowly, Col. Henley puſhed his ſword at

them, but whether he wounded any one I can't ſay, one of the Britiſh ſoldiers turned to the left and came down in the rear of me and ſaid, damn your eyes you buggers, you ſhall pay for this one of theſe days, and went off.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of Britiſh ſoldiers were round the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment at the time you mention?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The 15th December I was one of the proviſion guard near Proſpect-hill, and about eight o'clock in the evening hearing a gun fired ſtep'd out of the guard-houſe
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:016139_0066_0F9B7762594DEBA8"/>
to enquire of the ſentinel where the gun was fired; finding the ſentinel ſurrounded by five or ſix Britiſh ſoldiers, and hearing them demand of the ſentinel if his gun was loaded, I thought it neceſſary to order them to diſperſe, on this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they ſeized the ſentinel's firelock; I took hold of the firelock to wreſt it from them, they knock'd the ſentinel down with their fiſt, and then knock'd me down and kick'd me ſeveral times in the face, and one ſaid God damn him, fire him through, one of them had the gun in his hand at this time, and ſnapped the gun within four feet of my breaſt; a file of our men coming up, they all went off except the one who had the gun, the corporal ordered him to lay down the firelock, which be refuſed, they then ſeized him, wreſted the gun from him, and carried him priſoner to the guard-houſe; the ſentinel was much bruiſed in the face; they cloſed one of my eyes by a kick, ſo that I could not ſee out of it for two or three days.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of a Britiſh ſoldier being reſcued from your guard on or about the tenth of December?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The tenth of December I was on duty on the main-guard on Proſpect-hill; on hearing from one of our men that a ſentry had fired on ſome Britiſh ſoldiers, I went our to enquire into it; upon coming up to the ſentry, I found fifteen or eighteen Britiſh ſoldiers round the ſentinel; the Britiſh ſoldiers were reprimanding the ſentinel in high terms for firing on one of their men, I addreſſed myſelf to the chief ſpokeſman and deſired him to go off to his barracks, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon me and ſaid, "What buſineſs have you here you God damn clown, with a ſword under your arm. I'll have you to know we are not priſoners, but I will do as I have a mind;" I again ordered him to go to his barrack peaceably, and I would take no notice of his abuſe to me; he on this turned about and cry'd out, God damn you, kiſs my arſe, and repeated it three or four times; I then ordered the ſentry to take him into cuſtody, he then ſtriking his fiſts together, ſwore he'd kill the man who ſhould offer to take him; the other ſoldier who ſtood by ſaid he ſhould not be carried to the guard-houſe, they would turn out the regiment upon me firſt: On theſe threats I call'd for a ſerjeant of the guard; he not coming immediately. I ordered two of our guard who were coming down the hill to take the man who
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:016139_0067_0F9B776753891940"/>
had ſo groſly inſulted me into cuſtody and carry him to the guard-houſe; I went with the guard half way up the hill, and returning to the ſentinel looking back, ſaw a number of Britiſh ſoldiers round the two men who had the cuſtody of the Britiſh ſoldier above-mentioned, I ſaw a Britiſh ſoldier running up the hill, and heard the Britiſh ſoldiers cry out we have got him, on which a loud huzza was raiſed by the Britiſh ſoldiers in front of the barracks where the man run into; ſome little time after this I ſaw the man who I had taken into cuſtody as above related, walking before the barrack with a number of other Britiſh ſoldiers, I ordered a ſerjeant with a file of men to go and take him, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant went, the ſoldier ſeeing him coming ſet out and run, and the ſerjeant after him, the Britiſh ſoldiers ſeiz'd their comrade, pull'd him into the barrack, and puſh'd the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant back as he was entering the barrack and ſet up a loud huzza. All theſe tranſactions I afterwards reported to Major Gage our officer of the day, who adviſed me to make application to the Britiſh officers, I accordingly went down and finding ſome of them, Major Gage related the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of inſult and reſcue before-mentioned. The Britiſh officer told us the men were to be paraded preſently, and if I could point out the man he ſhould be confined. After the men were paraded I pointed out the fellow and he was ordered off the parade under guard. The next day accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to notice, I attended a Britiſh regimental court-marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, with the witneſſes to ſupport the chare againſt him; the man was arraigned, and I gave the court the neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and withdrew. The next day I had a line from Lieut. Col. Lind informing me with the proceedings of the court-martial, the criminal was ſentenced to receive fifty laſhes, the meſſenger told me that the puniſment was to be inflicted the next day at ten o'clock, and deſired me to attend; the next day according to the hour appointed I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and after waiting ſome time, was told that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment was deferred 'till two o'clock afternoon. I ſtaid 'till two o'clock and then ſaw the ſerjeant-major of the regiment, who told me the puniſhment was remitted, and the men ſet at liberty. Thus ended the matter, and I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver received any ſort of ſatisfaction. The whole of this tranſaction was reported to Col. Henley.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> One day the beginning of December, I came up to Cambridge with a patrole party, and was returning to the main-guard with a Britiſh ſoldier in cuſtody, (who I had taken up for being found without a paſs) carrying him to the guard-houſe, when my party, which conſiſted of ſix men, came oppoſite the barracks of the Britiſh ſoldiers, near a hundred of them ruſh'd upon us, ſeized hold of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner and carried him off, huzzaing. I reported the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action to the officer, but the man was not recovered that I ever knew of.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> On the 6th January laſt I was poſted as a ſentinel at the door of the proviſion ſtore, at the foot of Proſpect-hill, and Mr. Davis, one of the Deputy-Commiſſaries, delivered to my charge a Britiſh ſoldier whom he accuſed of ſtealing rice, he was in the room and ſtood at the door, and a large number of Britiſh ſoldiers came up and enquired what he was confined for, they did this ſeveral times, and preſently one of them, as I held my gun and bayonet acroſs the door, ſaid damn the bayonet we'll have him out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on this I charg'd my bayonet and bid them keep off, they ſeiz'd my gun and took off my bayonet and run away with it: They made no other attempt to reſcue the priſoner.</p>

               <p>THIS, in common with all Courts of Record, undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly has power to direct it's own proceedings, ſubject to the articles of war. I do not ground my objection on any thing in thoſe articles prohibitory of the claim I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but on the cuſtoms which prevail in the American ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and the ſuppoſed duty of the Judge-Advocate. Thoſe articles conſtitute a Judge-Advocate, who, although enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:016139_0072_0F9B77A5924C5768"/>
to proſecute In behalf of the government; hath always been conſidered in our armies bound to aſſiſt the priſoner, not only in points of law, but by an impartial repreſentation of facts. The whole evidence in the trial is taken in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſubject to the inſpection of the Court. You cannot, therefore, Gentlemen, be deceived by ſophiſtry, or miſled by rhetorick. Pleadings for this reaſon are unneceſſary, except on a point of law, for which the Judge-Advocate is preſumed to be competent; and unbiaſſed by the tenure of his office.</p>
               <p>I do not oppoſe theſe precedents becauſe they are Britiſh; had they been from Portugal or Turkey, and been perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and reaſonable, they ought to influence your determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Although the inſtance mentioned by Lieut. Bibby, is rather againſt the General, conſidered in the latitude to which he aims to extend his claim. The articles of war which govern the Britiſh army are extracted from the Roman code of civil law; and ours are nearly the ſame with thoſe adopted by the Britiſh mutiny act.</p>
               <p>The trials by Courts-martial are deſigned to be ſimple, ſpeedy and deciſive. The ſoldiers duty is clearly preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and the puniſhment for neglect of it plainly aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the articles which give juriſdiction to the Court that are to inquire into, and puniſh delinquency. The Judge-Advocate acts in the double capacity of proſecutor and council to the priſoner, which, thoſe who are acquainted with the proceedings of military courts, will allow not to be inconſiſtent duties. The office of Judge-Advocate has been conſidered by ſome in an army, the ſame as that of Attorney-General in the courts of criminal juriſdiction at common law, but I can ſafely appeal to your deciſion Gentlemen, if I am wrong in the duty of that officer in our army as I have laid it down.</p>
               <p>The altercations of the bar in the Courts of common law, ariſe from a combination of rights in free ſociety, which are unknown in an army. A man when he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a ſoldier, makes a temporary relinquiſhment of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of a citizen. If a proſecutor, (and in this caſe a very able one) is admitted in addition to the Judge-Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, ſurely it would be unreaſonable to deny council in defence of the priſoner—and then conſider, Gentlemen, what would be the conſequence: Every man brought before
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:016139_0073_0F9B77A5CE893100"/>
a Court-martial would be intitled to the ſame indulgence. All the ſubtleties and delays which prevail at common law would be introduced, into Courts-martial, infinitely to the public diſſervice, under the circumſtances which armies, <hi>Durante bello</hi> eſpecially ought to be maintained and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. I ſubmit my objection to the opinion of the Court.</p>
               <p>The Court was ordered to be cleared.</p>
               <p>The Court after debate, were of opinion, that General Burgoyne ſhould have the liberty of remarking upon the evidence offered by Col. Henley, and the Judge-Advocate was directed to acquaint the General with this determination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Court adjourns 'till Monday</hi> 23<hi>d February, at ten o'clock.</hi>

               <p>Col. Henley being called upon to cloſe his defence, reply'd as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Preſident and Gentlemen of the Court,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I HAVE particular reaſons, and in my own apprehenſion very ſufficient, for declining to ſay a ſingle word in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the illiberal abuſe thrown upon me, and the palpable diſhonour done to my country, by Gen. Burgoyne, in this Court. It is Mr. Preſident, a new thing under the ſun, and taken in all its circumſtances totally without example.—The Judge-Advocate will ſum up the evidence wiih ability and impartiality—Such is my conſciouſneſs of having done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thro' this whole affair, but what the honor and ſafety of my Country abſolutely required, that I ſhall reſt entirely ſatisfied with your deciſion; being at the ſame time fully perſuaded, that the impartial public, at whoſe bar I ſtand, will join with you in acquitting me from all the injurious and illiberal charges of Gen. Burgoyne, and that they will vindicate me for that humanity, characteriſtic of an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican officer, and with which the officers and ſoldiers of Gen. Burgoyne's late army have been treated, while I was honour'd with the command of the guards.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="unknown:016139_0074_0F9B77A6843F9DB0"/>Gen. Burgoyne then made a few remarks upon the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence offered by Col. Henley; and finiſhed his addreſs to the Court by ſubmitting ſome reaſons to juſtify the part he had taken during the trial, and in exculpation of himſelf from the reflections of Col. Henley. (No notes were tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of this ſpeech.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Court adjourned to Tueſday</hi> 24<hi>th inſtant, at ten o'clock.</hi>

               <p>The Judge-Advocate addreſſed the Court in ſubſtance as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Preſident and Gentlemen of the Court,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT remains with me to cloſe this cauſe which has employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much time, and been the ſubject of ſuch public expectation. The mode of inquiry eſtabliſhed in all tryals by Courts-martial, neceſſarily renders the proceſs tedious. This has been particularly ſo, and was an apology wanting, the patience exhibited by the Court through the whole courſe of it, would atone for the hours ſpent in the inveſtigation of the ſubject.</p>
               <p>This cauſe, Gentlemen, has been rendered important rather from the diſtinguiſhed rank and peculiar circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the very able proſecutor, than from the real merits of it. For however it may have been inſinuated that Col. Henley was appointed commandant of the garriſon at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, for the purpoſe of executing the bloody deſigns of an irritated, vindictive, and ſanguinary people; I believe the public, as well as the Court, will conſider the priſoner as alone intereſted in it; and that this tryal muſt forever ſtand the cleared reſutation to any one hardy enough to <hi>repeat</hi> an aſſertion as injurious as it is falſe.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was the charge handed to Gen. Heath, the guardian of the public military reputation in this depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than Col. Henley was ſuſpended from his command and an immediate inquiry ordered into his conduct.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="unknown:016139_0075_0F9B77A76DB23630"/>Yet notwithſtanding this prompt, this early endeavour to diſcover facts, and puniſh if criminality ſhould be proved, a wound has been aimed at the reputation of this country.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid, Gentlemen, before a reſpectable and crowded audience, that a general maſſacre of the troops of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention was in contemplation, and Col. Henley fix'd upon as the black inſtrument of execution. There was not an American preſent at that time, I dare aſſert, who did not feel indignation beat in every pulſe, while his heart reprobated the idea.</p>
               <p>This charge, heightened with all the pomp of words which attic diction and tragic eloquence could furniſh; painted in thoſe vivid, animated colours which keen feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and lively apprehenſions would ſupply; wanted nothing but <hi>truth</hi> to have anſwered the deſign propoſed. And that this was wanting, you Gentlemen, from the evidence now on your table, are, I preſume, convinced. The world here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after may be ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>If I thought General Burgoyne when making this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſincerely believed it to be true, tho' I ſhould wonder at his deception, I ſhould have a better opinion of his fairneſs: And while we ſmil'd at his panic, we might pity his timidity.</p>
               <p>Whatever particular, perſonal reaſons for gaining popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, or ſecuring the affections of his army; or great poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical motives may have actuated the proſecutor in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, you Gentlemen who are to judge upon oath as well as upon honour, the two ſtrangeſt ties that can bind you as men and as ſoldiers, will be ſwayed by nothing but the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred principles of truth and juſtice.</p>
               <p>It is my duty to exhibit facts as they ariſe from the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſtripped of the meretricious coverings which ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and rhetoric have attempted to conceal them in.</p>
               <p>However excuſable it may be in Gen. Burgoyne to take a partial ſurvey of the cauſe; by well turn'd periods to catch the attention and force the admiration of liſtning crowds; and by a brilliancy of expreſſion or affected nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſentiment attempt to dazzle, the more effectually to miſlead the Court; the Judge-Advocate has a very different part to act. He ought to know no party, but undeviating<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to follow the road marked out by truth alone.</p>
               <p>The difficulty of keeping the mind unbiased in this cauſe will ſtrike the minds of die Court. This is the tryal
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:016139_0076_0F9B77A8000AC9B8"/>
a gallant and meretorious officer; of a man, whoſe ſervices in camp and in the field moſt of you Gentlemen have been witneſſes to, and whoſe conduct as a citizen, previous to his commencing the ſoldier, was ever irreproachable. I muſt then depend on the candour of the Court, ſhould I err in ſumming up the evidence, to reſtore me to the path of diſintereſtedneſs. Much is due to the character of ſuch an officer; but more to the ſafety of thouſands, who, diſarmed and in our power, are intitled by the laws of nations, of war, of humanity and of juſtice, to protection and ſecurity, provided no mal-conduct on their parts, works a forfeiture of theſe rights. Fiat juſtitia ruat coelum. Let us now look into the evidence; the Court will adjudge the blame to fall where it ought.</p>
               <p>Col. Henley ſtands before you, Gentlemen, accuſed by Gen. Burgoyne &amp;c. (The charge was here read)</p>
               <p>The evidence in maintenance of this charge, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to five different heads, or claſſed as diſtinct facts, in each of which the priſoner has been repreſented by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor, either as principal agent, or a particeps criminis.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. The wounding of corporal Reeves at the guard-houſe on 19th December. The Colonel—a principal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſtabbing Tragget by a ſerjeant of the militia on the morning of 8th January. The Colonel an acceſſary.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſtabbing Willſon on the ſame morning. The Col. an accomplice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Col Henley wounding corporal Hadley on the parade at Proſpect-hill the 8th January.</p>
               <p n="5">5th. Head of evidence. To prove a general, inimical and murderous principle in the officers and ſoldiers of the guards, towards the Britiſh troops. In which the Colonel is involved, becauſe he took no care to curb the malevolence and cruelty of his men,; and ought therefore to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as an accomplice is all the violences committed.</p>
               <p>Agreeable to this arrangement. I will read the whole evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence adduced in ſupport of each ſeperate fact, and then contraſt it by the teſtimony offered on the part of the defence.</p>
               <p>The depoſitions of <hi>Buchannan, Thompſon, Steele</hi> (and Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> as to the nature of the wound) read, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by thoſe of Major <hi>Swaſey,</hi> Capt. <hi>Wild, Dean, Elijah Horton, Morſe, Brazier, Wadſworth Horton, and Barry.</hi> (Vide their teſtimonies.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="unknown:016139_0077_0F9B77AB320E7400"/>From this collective view of the evidence it appears, that Col. Henley on the 19th December in conſequence of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from General Heath, viſited the main-guard with Major Swaſey with the deſign of releaſing a number of Britiſh ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who had got into cuſtody, for different miſdemeanors. That he was calm and good humour'd, and proceeded to execute his inſtructions in the moſt ſuitable way, that of enquiring into the reſpective offences of the culprits, previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their diſmiſſion, and cautioning them againſt conduct which might ſubject them to another confinement. Reeves, in turn, being aſked the cauſe of his commitment, with ſome heſitancy inform'd the Colonel. And from his own account it appeared he had ſo groſsly affronted an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican officer that even the nerves of the candid, the placid Major Swaſey grew irritated, and he was provoked enough to give Reeves a very reſentful anſwer. Col. Henley's feelings being more keen, he called Reeves a raſcal; Reeves retorted the epithet; and the Colonel after repeatedly ordering ſilence, in order effectually to ſtop a very harſh altercation, which had enſued, diſmounted from his horſe, ſeized a gun and fix'd bayonet and pricked Reeves in the breaſt. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the concurrent teſtimony of all the witneſſes on the ſide of Col. Henley, that his deſign was rather to ſilence Reeves than to wound him; rather to convince him he would be obey'd than to injure him. The extreme ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the wound, which, from the ſurgeon's account was little more than a ſcratch, confirms this to have been the Colonel's intention. It would certainly have been better to have remanded him to the guard-houſe. And if, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, you think the witneſſes in ſupport of the charge have told you all that really paſſed, you ought, at leaſt, to think, that Col. Henley is a raſh, paſſionate, precipitate officer, a man who conſiders ſtabbing his fellow-creatures as a very venial offence. But if full credence is given to the evidence of <hi>Dean, E. Horton, Morſe, Brazier, Barry</hi> and particularly <hi>Wadſworth Horton,</hi> the Court will conſider whether an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, acting in ſuch a character as the Colonel then appeared in, ſo ſaucely and abuſively reply'd to by a priſoner in Reeve's circumſtances, is not pardonable, I do not ſay juſtifiable, in adopting ſuch a mode of ſilencing impudence and repreſſing contempt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="unknown:016139_0078_0F9B77AC79CAF7B8"/>It has been ſaid that Reeve's behaviour was only firm, not inſolent Britiſh firmneſs often ſo nearly approaches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence, that Europeans as well as Americans have been very apt to confound them. The Court will recollect the pains taken, in one or two inſtances during this tryal, to get from the Britiſh witneſſes their idea of inſolence. They all affected to think it impoſſible a Briton could look inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. It was, they ſaid, only looking up. But this <hi>os ſublime,</hi> this erect countenance which they boaſt of, leads them to looking down upon the reſt of the world, though not always with impunity. Britain is feared becauſe ſhe is powerful. What pity it is a nation cannot be juſt as well as gallant. Leſs pride had prevented the diſmemberment of her empire, had ſaved the blood of thouſands. And real magnanimity had e'er this arreſted the hand of deſtruction from the heads of men, whoſe greateſt fault (once the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious fault of Britons!) is the love of freedom.</p>
               <p>Let us now inquire, whether in this action the priſoner is guilty of the laſt part of the charge, viz. "Intentional mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der."</p>
               <p>Murder is thus defined by one of the firſt ſages of common law.
<q>When a perſon of found memory and deſcretion, unlawfully killeth any reaſonable creature in being, and under the King's (or State's) peace, with malice afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought, either expreſſed by the party or implied by law, ſo as the party wounded and hurt, die of the wound or hurt within a year and a day after the ſame</q>
3 Inſt. 47,</p>
               <p>The grand criterion of this crime is malice prepenſe, the dictate of a wicked, depraved and malignant ſpirit; and is either expreſs or implied. Foſter 256.</p>
               <p>I will not trouble the Court with multiplied authorities. The above definition of Lord Coke's is ſo well analyſed and illuſtrated by the able and accurate Judge Blackſtone, that a few pages from his commentaries will furniſh the Court with all the law neceſſary on this point. Vid. 4th Blackſt. 195, 6, 7, 8 9, 200, 201.</p>
               <p>From the doctrine here laid down you will conſider, appying the evidence to the principles juſt read, whether the priſoner can be ſaid to have acted from expreſs or implied malice. Did Col. Henley aim at taking Reeves's life? If he did, and the provocation did not ariſe to the degree, which the law makes neceſſary to excuſe, although the ſtroke was not
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:016139_0079_0F9B77AC986C9428"/>
ſufficient to effect the murderous deſign, you muſt be of opinion that the laſt article of the charge is proved. If he did not attempt Reeves's life, you ought to acquit him of the intentional guilt he is in this inſtance charged with.</p>
               <p>But it is ſaid, that admitting Reeves's behaviour to have amounted to ſuch a degree of provocation that if the Col. had killed him in the paſſionate inſtant and while ſitting on his horſe, it might not have been murder, yet the diſmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gave him time for recollection; and had he then killed inſtead of wounded him, it would have been murder.</p>
               <p>I muſt deny this diſtinction to be juſt. And to ſhew that the General was erroneous in this poſition, I ſhall read a caſe cited by Judge Foſter from Lord Coke and Hale. Vid. Foſt. 294. From this and many ſimilar adjudications which might be produced, it is clear, if Col. Henley would not have been guilty of murder had he ſtabbed Reeves to the heart, while upon his horſe, that his committing the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide after the diſmounting and ſeizing the bayonet, wou'd not have been evidence of that crime, becauſe there was not time for the blood to cool.</p>
               <p>Intentional criminality is puniſhable at the bar of God alone. Yet, Gentlemen, ſhould you be convinced, that Col. Henley deſigned to kill Reeves at the time he made the paſs at him although he fail'd; you muſt conſider him as a very improper perſon to handle muſkets and bayonets, for the man was ſo intirely in his power, that he could eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have adopted any other mode of puniſhment. And tho' he might deſerve a caning or a flagilation for his impudence and inſult, he ſurely did not merit death.</p>
               <p>The next tranſaction is the ſtabbing Tragget by a ſerjeant of the militia on the 8th January.</p>
               <p>This is proved by <hi>Page, Lee</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> and the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons <hi>Walker</hi> and <hi>Clartey</hi> ſwear to the nature and depth of the wound. Major <hi>Foſter</hi> and Lieut. <hi>Smith</hi> to the pecea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble behaviour of the Britiſh ſoldiers while the detachment was marching by. Their depoſitions are ſtrongly contraſted by thoſe of <hi>Kettle, Duckinfield, Anderſon,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Dodge.</hi> (Vid. the evidence of each.)</p>
               <p>It has not been alledged that Col. Henley was preſent at or knowing to this tranſaction. I ſhall not therefore here minutely enter into the circumſtances attending it, but only conſider whether Col. Henley can be adjudged an acceſſary to the ſtabbing of Tragget.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="unknown:016139_0080_0F9B77AD4DEC4520"/>Acceſſary <hi>(particeps criminis)</hi> is where a man is guilty of a felonious offence, not principally, but by participation, as by command, advice or concealment.</p>
               <p>A man may be an acceſſary either before or after the fact.</p>
               <p>An acceſſary before the fact is he that being abſent at the time of the felony committed doth yet procure, counſel, command or abet another to commit a felony, 1 H. P. C. 615.</p>
               <p>Acceſſary after the fact is he that receives, aſſiſts, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts any man that hath committed felony or murder, 1 H. P. C. 618.</p>
               <p>Is there the leaſt evidence to ſhew, that in the caſe of Tragget, the Colonel comes within the circumſtances neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary by the above deſcription, to involve him in the predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contended for? There certainly is not.</p>
               <p>It is hardly neceſſary to obſerve, that as there was no felony committed, there could be no acceſſary. And that if the Colonel had any thing to do in this affair, he muſt be conſidered as a principal; for in all crimes under the degree of felony there are no acceſſaries. 4 Blackſt. 36.</p>
               <p>So far from Col. Henley's counſelling, abetting, aſſiſting or comforting the perſons concerned in this action, it does not appear that he ever heard of it, till the witneſſes rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the fact upon oath before the Court.</p>
               <p>But, ſays General Burgoyne, Col. Henley's conduct had a great effect on his guards: He was known to be no friend of the Britiſh ſoldiers; he had himſelf wounded one, and been violent in his menaces againſt them all: he thus influenced his ſoldiers to ſtab and murder whom they pleaſed, if they belonged to the Britiſh army; and ought therefore to be conſidered as an accomplice in every outrage which took place. If this reaſoning is concluſive, by the ſame logic the General himſelf is an acceſſary to all the murders perpetrated by the ferocious Bipeds, the Savages who accompanied and diſgraced his army laſt ſummer. Ought it to be ſaid that becauſe theſe <hi>black</hi> attendants knew that Gen. Burgoyne did not love Americans, that therefore he would be pleaſed at the butchery of the nerveleſs old man, defenceleſs female, and infant prattler? Becauſe he hated rebels, he therefore influenced the Indians to maſſacre that young unfortunate, the inoffending and wretched Miſs McCrea!</p>

                  <pb n="82" facs="unknown:016139_0081_0F9B77AE05CC2950"/>The wounding Willſon on the ſame morning is proved by <hi>Kidley</hi> and <hi>Keith.</hi> The evidence in juſtification of this act, is collected from the teſtimonies of <hi>Peirce, Lewis,</hi> and Major <hi>Swaſey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The incidents whieh led to this affair, appears from the evidence to be theſe: On the morning of 8th January, Col. Henley and Major Swaſey on their way down to Proſpect-hill met Buchannan, who the Court have before heard of as an offender as well as a witneſs, ſtealing up to town un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cover of another man's paſs. Deceptions of this kind had been ſo often played off upon the centries, that the Colonel thought proper to ſend Buchannan to the guard-houſe for this flagrant breach of general orders. And at the ſame time gave orders to the corporal and file of men who had the charge of him to fire on any men daring enough to attempt reſcuing him. Major Swaſey (the town Major) ſays that reſcues had become frequent. This order then was right, and neceſſary: Particularly as the guards, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed entirely of militia, had too often ſuffered themſelves to be duped, ridiculed and inſulted, and wanted ſpirited or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and ſupport to encourage them to diſcharge their duty and trample on contempt. The guard proceeded with their priſoner, but before they reached the guard-houſe, were interrupted in their march by a large cluſter of Britiſh ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who by preſſing upon them, and huzzaing and clamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, gave Buchannan a very favourable opportunity to effect an eſcape, and he did not want much urging to make the moſt of it. Willſon who was moſt buſy in this matter after Buchannan had got huſled among his comrades, ſeized the corporal of the guard who was endeavouring to recover his priſoner from the crowd and ſtopped his purſuit. This rouſed Peirce, who could not tamely look on and ſee his corporal checked in an act of duty, and he made a paſs at Willſon and wounded him; and very honeſtly tells you that he did it with a good will.</p>
               <p>Though the witneſſes to this affair militate more than in any other part of the evidence, yet it is paſt a doubt that a reſcue or ſomething extremely like one took place. Kidley and Keith both ſay, that they did not ſee Buchannan eſcape, but they heard afterwards he had. Peirce ſwears poſitively that he was forceably taken from the guard, and Lewis corroberates his evidence. Major Swaſey whoſe candour in
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:016139_0082_0F9B77AF70F8D998"/>
every narrative he has given the Court ſtamps him as reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a witneſs as has been ſworn, declares that he ſaw a Britiſh ſoldier take hold of one of the guard, at the ſame time Buchannan was puſhing his way through the crowd of Britiſh ſoldiers who were calling out and encouraging him to run off.</p>
               <p>Should the Court think a reſcue was made and Willſon principally concerned in it, they muſt think Peirce juſtified in what he did. For I aſſert that had he killed him upon the ſpot, and wounded every man who was abetting the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue, he would have been excuſable.</p>
               <p>I will produce only one authority to juſtify this opinion, Homicide (ſaith Lord Hale) in <hi>civil</hi> cauſes may be juſtified in ſome caſes: As where a Sheriff attempting to make a lawful arreſt in a civil action or to retake one who has been arreſted and made his eſcape, is reſiſted by the party and unavoidably kills him in the affray. H. P. C. 71.</p>
               <p>If this doctrine is true upon a civil proceſs, <hi>a fortiori,</hi> it is on a criminal one. In this caſe Buchannan was an offender in cuſtody: Whoever ventured to reſcue him did it at their utmoſt peril. Britiſh ſoldiers are too well acquainted with diſcipline and military ſeverity not to know they were acting egregiouſly ill. But ſuch attempts had before ſucceeded, and why not then? The offenders had before eſcaped with impunity, and why not again? Willſon painfully learnt that ſuch reaſoning was ſometimes wrong. I wiſh all his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-ſoldiers may profit from his experience.</p>
               <p>The Court will conſider the principles before laid down under the head of acceſſary, and as far as they are applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, allow their operation. And then determine whether any part of the charge is ſupported againſt Col. Henley in the caſe of Willſon.</p>

                  <hi>Mr. Preſident and Gentlemen of the Court,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE come now to the laſt and principal tranſaction of of the 8th January—the wounding Hadley on the parade.</p>
               <p>It will be neceſſary to ſtate the circumſtances anterior to this unfortunate action. You have the fulleſt proof, the confeſſion of the proſecutor, that a centinel on the evening of the 7th was knock'd down on his poſt, that he was beat, diſarmed and his gun carried off. Col. Gerriſh, like a true ſpirited officer, upon hearing of this daring outrage, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined immediately and in perſon to diſcover the Britiſh ſoldiers who were concerned in it. He accordingly with a party of his regiment ſurrounded one of the Britiſh barracks, and after ſome oppoſition ſearched ſeveral rooms which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſuſpicious. The conduct of a number of very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreperous fellows, which he found in one of the rooms, ſtrengthened his ſuſpicion, and he thought proper, after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſaulted, menaced and inſulted, to ſend ſeveral of them to the main-guard. The tranſactions of this evening were reported to Col. Henley next morning with aggravation. The Colonel finding he had got ſo large a number of Britiſh ſoldiers as 29, priſoners in the main-guard which was ſituated ſo near the barracks of the Britiſh army that ſome difficulty might ariſe, adjudged it moſt prudent to remove all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners up to the town, where a proper inquiry could be made; the culpable puniſhed, and the innocent diſmiſſed. A detachment of 100 men were ordered to the main-guard for this purpoſe. And the Colonel with the town major ſet out for the Hill to ſee that the detachment did their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. On his way down, he met Buchannan, playing off upon a ſentinal the evaſive trick which had now become common, with the Britiſh ſoldiers, that of eſcaping from their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks under counterfeit or borrowed paſſes. The Colonel gave the orders (reſpecting Buchannan) we have before read; and proceeded on for the main-guard; not with the moſt agreeable feelings, if we ſuppoſe the irritation which a
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:016139_0084_0F9B77B05FA015A8"/>
variety of offenſive reports and provoking conſiderations, muſt have raiſed in his mind, during the courſe of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Soon after he got to the main-guard, the detachment marched into the citadel and formed near the guard-houſe. By this time a very large body of Britiſh ſoldiers had aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled near the guard-houſe, Captain Brooks ſays, to the number of three hundred. The Colonel apprehenſive that ſome diſorders might ariſe, when the Britiſh priſoners ſhould be ſent off with the detachment, ordered the Britiſh ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to diſperſe—finding he was not likely to be obeyed—he called for a dozen men from the detachment, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a movement among them, and they were going off; when juſt at this time Buchannan was reſcued within ſight of Col. Henley. This act of inſolent triumph, determined Col. Henley to take the immediate perſonal command of the detachment, which he inſtantly marched out of the cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del upon the parade in the rear of the barracks. He had hardly time to halt his men before he was ſurrounded by the Britiſh ſoldiers, who amounted to near two hundred men, which was double his number. I rate the number on a medium between what they were ſaid to be, by the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for the proſecution, and thoſe in behalf of Col. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. Conſider now Gentlemen, what muſt have been Col. Henley's ſenſations; at the head of a party of militia, who, from being daily affronted by the Britiſh ſoldiers, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their jeſt; that it had at length become abſolutely neceſſary to convince theſe Britons, that there was energy enough in their guards to force obedience and curb licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs; that a tumult had ariſen the night before, and that an act had juſt taken place which was a defiance to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: that he had not room to manoeuvre his men without great difficulty, owing to the Britiſh ſoldiers preſſing in upon the party; and that theſe were moſt of them the very men who had juſt before been laughing at the party, while paraded in the citadel, and who, in contempt of his orders, were again collected to keep up the laugh at the expence of the detachment. I put it upon this footing, becauſe I think it was apparent they were aſſembled rather to inſult than to aſſail the party; though they were ſo near, that it was only ſtretching out their arms, and it would have been eaſy to have diſarmed the detachment by a ſudden movement; eſpecially after the Colonel had detached a quarter of his
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:016139_0085_0F9B77B101C75668"/>
whole party to bring out the priſoners from the guard-houſe. —Under theſe circumſtances, Gentlemen, and ſtill more ſo if he was apprehenſive of an attempt to diſarm his men, how extremely difficult muſt it have been for the Colonel to have checked his reſentment, or ſtopped the hand which had been ſo repeatedly and inſolently defy'd. The Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel had told them he had loſt a priſoner, threatned to fire upon them, and given reiterated orders for them to diſperſe before he made the lunge at Hadley. It has been proved that the Britiſh ſoldiers in general were ſlowly moving off at the time, but not that Hadley was one of them. If you are convinced, Gentlemen, that he was going off, you will then conſider how far the Colonel's impetuoſity is reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and puniſh him accordingly.</p>
               <p>It appears clearly that the Britiſh ſoldiers had no weapons of any kind in their hands, that they made no attempt on the guard nor ſtruck any of them, from which it may be a queſtion, whether had Hadley died of the wound he received from Col. Henley, the Colonel would not have been guilty of murder, becauſe upon the principles of municipal law, words alone, however impudent or provoking, will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce murder to man-ſlaughter, though a very ſlight blow firſt given by the perſon kill'd might have made the killing man-ſlaughter, or even a leſs ſpecies of homicide.</p>
               <p>If the nice diſtinctions of common law are to be made the rules of conduct in military diſcipline, and the regulation of a garriſon, Col. Henley muſt ſuffer. But I imagine Gentlemen, you will hardly admit this to be true. Becauſe ſoldiers and citizens are intitled to very different privileges.</p>
               <p>In an army, the diſobedience of an order is ſometimes puniſhed with inſtant death, and ſuch an action juſtified and applauded, which was it to take place among citizens might ſubject a man to a halter.</p>
               <p>Col. Henley had ſtood for ſome time, firſt in the citadel, and afterwards on the parade at the head of a detachment armed, and heard the provoking epithets of yankey and rebel very liberally thrown out againſt his guards, by the Scotch and Britiſh loyaliſts who ſurrounded him. The word <hi>yankey,</hi> when uſed by theſe proficients in abuſe, is intended to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the idea of clowniſhneſs and cowardice. And to call a man yankey rebel, is conſidered by them as the ſtrongeſt term of invective. Where is the officer in ſuch circumſtances who could ſuppreſs his indignation upon ſuch an occaſion?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="unknown:016139_0086_0F9B77B1C1013F78"/>If Gentlemen you ſhould be ſatisfied, that Hadley at the time he was wounded, was moving off, you will conſider whether Col. Henley is not very blame-worthy for making a violent lunge into a man's body, who was obeying his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and getting out of his way—ſhould you be convinced that Hadley was not removing, though ſuch preremptory and repeated orders were given him with his comrades to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to their barracks, your opinion will be different.</p>
               <p>The witneſſes under the laſt head of evidence are Lieut. Bibby, Lieut. Col. Lind, ſerjeants Fleming and Willſon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bibby ſwears that on the morning of the 8th January, as he paſſed over the parade where the detachment was drawn up, he heard an officer who he took to be the Captain of the guard, "Damn his men for inattention and ordering them to run any man through who came near them." This ſpeech appears to have been made ſoon after the wounding Hadley, while the paſſions were in a tumult, and the pulſe beating high from what had paſſed. The order was raſh and unjuſtifiable, and the Court will conſider whether the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample juſt ſet by Col. Henley, in ſtabbing Hadley, did not occaſion it, and how far he is accountable for encouraging ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of ſuch a nature.</p>
               <p>The inſtance mentioned by Col. Lind, of the ſentry's firing on three camp women, cannot by any means affect Col. Henley, becauſe it does not appear that he ever gave ſuch orders, nor was any report made of it to him. For ſurely it would be unreaſonable to make the commandant of ſuch a garriſon as this is, where the guards are made up of a young and inexperienced militia, unſkill'd in military ſcience or duty, accountable for all the miſtakes and violences of ſuch ſoldiers. Had a complaint been made to him of this action, and he had refuſed taking notice of it, it would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly have been ſuch an avowal of it, as to have made him reſponſible for all the conſequences of it.</p>
               <p>The expreſſions and violent menaces, which Fleming and Willſon ſwear they heard Col. Henley throw out at the Adjutant-General's office on 16th December, carry with them, <hi>prima facie</hi> very ſtrong marks of malice, and a heart boiling with the moſt vindictive and turbulent paſſions. But the Court will recollect that the Colonel had that morning a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Maſon and Crane being knock'd down and diſarmed, while one of them was on his poſt. They were both much
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:016139_0087_0F9B77B61FC96F98"/>
beat. It does not appear what led to the converſation, but Col. Henley was relating the affair to ſome officer in the office when the ſerjeant came up and met with the ſalute, which has been laid before the Court. The greeting was rough to be ſure, but might not the meaning only be, that the Devil had got into their barracks and poſſeſſed the occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers of them, and that he ſhould turn exorciſt ſome night or other, turn the barracks inſide out, and expel him from their territory. But I mean not Gentlemen to palliate this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the words are before you. You are the judges, and will determine how far the ſentiments expreſſed were mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and afterwards as ſuch, acted from by the Colonel.</p>
               <p>I will not take up any of the Court's time by remarks on the evidence of the different reſcues that took place from the beginning of December to 8th January, except of that ſworn to by Lieutenant Stearns. This officer, after being inſulted in the groſſeſt manner by words and geſture; after having the fellow who gave it reſcued in his ſight; and after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, through tenderneſs, to the man's own officers; proving the complicated charge againſt him; to be then tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled with by a promiſe of a proper puniſhment being inflicted on the aggreſſor, and after all to have the fellow ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unpuniſhed; proves the neceſſity of exerciſing the right ſet up by Gen. Heath of puniſhing the offenders of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention troops, who could thus commit enormities with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, and ſhews in how contemptable a light the officers of the guards were held by the Britiſh army, and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency of convincing them that there was ſpirit enough to reſent, injuries and energy enough to chaſtiſe offenders.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now ſubmit the cauſe, Gentlemen, to your deciſion. Many obſervations have been omitted, which might have been pertinent—but which have doubtleſs occurred to the minds of the Court, particularly with reſpect to the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and contradictions of the witneſſes. And I doubt not your judgment will vindicate the juſtice of our country, and be approved by the honeſt and impartial wherever it ſhall be known.</p>
               <p>The Court was then ordered to be cleared.</p>
               <p>THE Court after mature conſideration are of opinion that the charge againſt Col. Henley is not ſupported, and that he be diſcharged from his arreſt.</p>
