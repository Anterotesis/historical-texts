            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER</head>
            <p>IT is ſad to conſider how many <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſtians</hi> live in the <hi>Utter Neglect</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> and how few <hi>Communicants</hi> are careful to <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare duly, Eat and Drink worthily, and Live anſwerably.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A great deal has been written upon this <hi>Occaſion,</hi> to which I have added the following <hi>Sheets,</hi> which I may be allow'd, I hope, to Publiſh, without being thought to pretend to any thing Extraordinary, or detract from the <hi>Excellent Performances</hi> of others.</p>
            <p>For while the Caſe requires and admits Help, there can be no Harm in making
<pb facs="unknown:001739_0003_0FB77C146637D040"/>further Trials; eſpecially in thoſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances where the moſt likely Means are not ever the moſt Effectual: But Succeſs more eſpecially depends upon the <hi>Divine Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſing,</hi> which is not always given in Regular Proportion to the Natural Aptitude of the Means, but ſometimes in a ſovereign and unaccountable Manner; <hi>That no Fleſh ſhould Glory in his Preſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, it is too plain to be deny'd, That the <hi>different Capacities and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes</hi> of Men make a <hi>Variety</hi> uſeful, if not neceſſary; and that there may be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of many <hi>other Circumſtances</hi> which ſhall give a meaner Performance, the Advantage with ſome People, as to Uſefulneſs, above others that are more Spritely and Elaborate. Nay, it is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible Thing, that a man may read a Book upon ſome fore in Conſideration, which ſhall be bleſſed to do Him that good which could never be expected from better Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes not known of, or not minded.</p>

               <pb facs="unknown:001739_0004_0FB77C17E6E1C7F8"/>
Upon theſe Accounts I have Publiſh'd the enſuing <hi>Papers,</hi> hoping they may be uſeful to <hi>ſome,</hi> whatever their <hi>General</hi> Entertainment be.</p>

               <p>When He has ſaid, <hi>Do this,</hi> either He does not mean what He ſays, or does not ſpeak to thee; or elſe thy Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is at once inexcuſable and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable.</p>
               <p>Can the Words be wreſted? Is any <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> capable of conteſting their Senſe? What can <hi>Do this,</hi> ſignify leſs than a Poſitive Command? Or, how can the Will of my Prince be ever ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd, ſo as to oblige me, if ſo plain Terms are by any Cavil to be eluded?</p>
               <p>But does He ſpeak to me? If I were a true Diſciple, I were indeed within the Compaſs of the Law, and muſt be either a Communicant or a Rebel.</p>
               <p>Conſider, O my Soul, and don't raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly daſh thy Hopes, to eſcape thy Duty. 'Tis true, I am not ſuch a Chriſtian as I ſhould be: But am I willing to have my Name miſſing in the Book of Life?
