            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To express the mirth and Jollyty of all our friends in this Country who have heard of this weighty Concern, for now it seems as if heaven it self did Contribute to our

               <hi>England Holland</hi> and <hi>Switzerland</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the onely bulworks and places of Refuge that the Hereticks have left: and it hath Cost us many a nights study and divers meetings to Consult how we may bring them under, and now we have an Excellent opportunity, to which purpose our King hath resolved to bring the <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers</hi> under his Dominion and Convert those Hereticks by his Dragoons: and also to do his best to destroy that <hi>Nest of Hereticks</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> which resolution I will Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanrly put him in mind off as often as I give him absolution.</p>
            <p>When I Consider of these things it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces me to think how zeal us <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>: I say when I Consider and think of these things they do so rejoyce me that I am almost over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmd there with, nay it is to great that I am not able to write it, and indeed it is the greatest pleasure I have in this world, and I must say that since the last Letter I received from you things have been so forwarded that I must now ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaryly Conclude we are not far from the highest step: and nothing can be said to be perfect now, till I can demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly see such signes that will testify the work is compleat.</p>
            <p>And as Concerning that Letter of yours which gave us that Incomparable satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and joy, the principle things therein are these following: <hi>first,</hi> you did very wisely not to follow the Litteral direction that we had laid downe, but to use such endeavors and devices as the then acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and present affaires did require, and indeed they were such as did much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the perfection of our bussines: namely, the sending the <hi>Bishops to the Tower:</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princess</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi> to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and divers <hi>Heretick Gentlemen</hi> to <hi>Windsor</hi> where they Expected the <hi>Queen</hi> should lye in: in which inventions you shewed your admirable skill and Judgment: for they without doubt would have been present and you say the Laws of <hi>England</hi> do so require it Therefore it was your wisdom to advise the King to impose some
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000438_0005_0FA5AF274E1E2E78"/>
thing upon the <hi>Bishops</hi> which they could not in honor do, and so find occasion to send them to the <hi>Tower</hi> and there keep them till the great worke was done.</p>
            <p>Neither was the other part of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to be admired, when you perswaded the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princess</hi> of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> that it was a month or six weeks before the <hi>Queen</hi> could be delivered and they might easily return sooner, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you had not taken this course they would have waited and have been prying into the bussines, and the other is also as praise worthy as any, for you could not have trickt those Heretick fops better then to send them like <hi>fools</hi> to <hi>windsor</hi> with a Commission to set up a <hi>bed,</hi> provide a <hi>Cradle</hi> and a <hi>Nurs</hi> and divers other things necessary for her lying in, and also to wait there till she came, which you never intended she should, and likewise it was a good project of yours to give out that the Queen altered her mind often about the place she would be delivered at, for when you had given out seven or eight several times it was resolved to be <hi>windsor, Hampton court, Richmond,</hi> St. <hi>James'</hi>s, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they did not at last beleeve when you Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in earnest, by which means you catcht the fools neatly: all which were neatly Laid and contrived, for which we thank you wishing all succes to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes and Endeavors toward the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting this mighty work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> That you keep both their Majestys to their former Resolution in declareing this child to be really theire owne, and also by publick proclamation for a day of Thanks giveing to tell the whole Nation he was their son, and Heir to the Crowne in spight of all the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teing Inquisitive <hi>Hereticks</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> who have got some kind of sent of the work and designe now in hand, but I can tell them, they think they know more then really they do, how ever they have En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored by dispersing of various <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to render his Majesty suspected, and I assure you we have often time been in great fear that your King would have fell of and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from his pious Resolution, for we well know that he is but a weak man, and you know such kind of people are easyly led away: when they have nothing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon but what lyeth in other mens heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> That there is such great care taken for the young Prince, and also in case of the <hi>Kings</hi> death to declare his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort <hi>Queen Regent,</hi> and to appoint your self, the <hi>Lord Chancelor</hi> with some other <hi>good men</hi> to govern while the <hi>Prince</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age. And by the same manner we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended our K<hi>ing,</hi> his [reputed] Father ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing appointed <hi>Cardinal Mazarine</hi> for his Tutor and Governer till by force of Arms he was able to make his way to the Crowne, and if any are so Inquisitive as to ask if this Prince shall be brought to the Crowne by the same manner, let such know that it may be easily done for our King hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> That which administers great Joy to me and all the Fathers of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, is, that the <hi>King</hi> of great <hi>Brittain</hi> is resolved and hath also promised you that in case this Child should dye, there shall be another ready to put into the crad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le in his place, but if that should prove difficult and that there should not be a Child readily found to carry on the show with some reputation, you must take the same course as before and send the <hi>King</hi> to <hi>St Winifreds</hi> well to wash that <hi>little</hi> he hath, let the <hi>Queen</hi> wear a <hi>Cushion upon her belly</hi> for nine months and that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

into England: with promises that they shall all be advanced according to their several quallifications, which will be of great use for the carrying on this blessed work, defending the <hi>young Prince</hi> against his Conspireing Enemies, and to root out all the Hereticks. In which work I do promise not to be negligent, but ro send over as many as I can possibly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade.</p>
            <p>And now as these things are truely Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in themselves, so have they in me and all the Fathers of our Society created an un expressible Joy. If I should tell you how I was affected when I heard this news, I could say no more but this, that my soul was separated from my body, and transported with Joy and gladnes into the paradis of the most high, which no man can conceive; as <hi>St. Paul</hi> writes of himself when he was taken up into the third heaven.</p>
            <p>Now Concerning the question you have put to me, that is what is the best cours to be taken to root out all the <hi>Hereticks</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to which I answer, there are divers ways to do that, bnt we must consider which is the best to make use oft in <hi>England,</hi> I am sure you are not Ignorant how many thousand <hi>Hereticks</hi> we have in france by the <hi>power of our Dragons</hi> converted in the space of one year: and by the Doctrin of those <hi>booted Apostles</hi> turnd more in one Month then <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> by their preaching could in ten year: this is a most Excellent method and far excells those of the <hi>great preachers</hi> and <hi>teachers</hi> that have lived since <hi>Christ,</hi> his time But I have spoke with divers <hi>Fathers of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi> who do think that your <hi>King</hi> is not strong enof to accomplish his designe by such kind of force. So that we cannot expect to have our work done in that manner for the <hi>Hereticks</hi> are to strong in the three <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> and therefore we must seek to convert them by fair means before we fall upon them with <hi>Fire Sword halters, Jailes</hi> and other such like punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And therefore I can give you no better advice but to begin with Soft easy means, weedle them in by <hi>promises of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi> and <hi>offices of Honor</hi> till you have made them <hi>dip</hi> themselves in treasonable actions against the Laws Established, and then they are bound to serve for fear: When they have done thus turn them out and serve others so by putting them in their places, and by this way gaine as many at you can: and for the <hi>Hereticks</hi> that are in places of profit or Honor turn out or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spend them on pretence of <hi>Misbehaviour,</hi> by which their places are forfeit and they subject to what Judgment you please to give upon them: then you must form a <hi>Camp</hi> that must consist of none but <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes</hi> this will make the <hi>Hereticks</hi> heartles and Conclude all means of releife or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery is gone. And lastly take the short and the best way which is to <hi>surprise</hi> the <hi>Hereticks</hi> on a sudden; and to Incourage the <hi>Zealous Catholikes</hi> let them <hi>Sacrifice</hi> them all and <hi>wash their hands in their blood,</hi> which will be an acceptable <hi>offering to god:</hi> and this was the method I took in <hi>France</hi> which hath well you see succeeded: but it cost me many threatnings and Promises before I could bring it thus far, our <hi>King</hi> being a long time very un willing</p>
            <p>But at last I got him on the hip: for he had <hi>Lay</hi> with his <hi>daughter in Law</hi> for which I would by no means give him <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution</hi> till he had given me an <hi>Instrument</hi> under his owne hand and Seal to <hi>Sacrifice</hi> all the <hi>Hereticks</hi> in one day: Now as soon as I had my <hi>desired Commission</hi> I appointed the day when this should be done, and in the mean time made ready some thousands of Letters to be sent into all parts of <hi>France</hi> in one post night, I was never better pleased then at that time, but the <hi>King</hi> was a affected with some Compassion for the <hi>Hugonets</hi> because they had been a means to bring him to his Crowne and Throne: and the longer he was under it the more sorrowful he was, often complaining and desireing me to give him his Commission

again but that I would by no perswasion do, adviseing him to repent of that hainous sinne, and also telling him that the trouble and Horror of his spirit did not proceed from any thing of evil in those things that were to be done, but from that great wickednes which he had done; and that he must resolve to undergo the severe burden of a troubled mind for one of them or the other, and if he would remaine Satisfied as it was, his sin being forgiven there would in a few days be a perfect atto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement made for it and he perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to god againe, but all this would not pacifie him for the longer the more Restles, and therefore I ordered him to retire to his closet and there spend his time Constantly in prayer without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any one to interrupt him: and this was in the morning early when the Evening following I was to send away all my Letters, I did indeed make the more hast for fear he should disclose it to any one, yet I had given him a strickt Charge to keep it to himself, and the very thing that I most feared to my great sorrow came to pass, for Just in the nick of time the <hi>Divel</hi> who hath always his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments at work sent the <hi>Prince of Conty</hi> to the court, who asked for the King, and it was told him that he was in his Closet and would speak with no man: he Impudently answered <hi>that he must and would speak with him:</hi> and so went directly to his Closet: he being a great Peer no man durst hinder him, and being come to the King he soon perceived by his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance that he was under some great trouble of mind for he looked as if he had been goeing into the other world Imediately: Sir [said he] what is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with you, the King at the first refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to tell him, but he pressing harder upon him, at last the King with a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Complainent burst out and said I <hi>have given Father la Chaise under my owne hand a Comission to murder, all the Hugonets in one day, and this Evening will the Letters be dispatcht to all paris by the post for the performing it: So that there is but small time left for my Hugonet subjects to live who have never done me any harm,</hi> whereupon this cursed Rogue answered, let him give you, your Comission againe: <hi>the King said how shall I get it out of his hand <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

            </p>
            <p>So when I saw nothing els would do I put my hand in my pocket and gave it him, which he carried immediately to the <hi>King</hi> and gave him that and all my Letters which they burnt: and being all done the <hi>King</hi> said that now his heart was at Ease, now how he should be Eased by the <hi>devil,</hi> or so well satisfied with a fals Joy I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this I know that it was a very wicked and ungodly action as well in his <hi>Majesty</hi> as the <hi>Prince of Conty:</hi> and did not a Little increase the burden and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his Majestys sins: I soon gave an account of this affair to several <hi>Fathers of our Society,</hi> who promised to doe their best to prevent the foresaid <hi>Prince</hi> doeing such another act, which was accordingly done: for with in the space of six days after the damned action he was <hi>Poisoned and well he deserved it.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> also did suffer to, but in another fashion, for discloseing the designe to the <hi>Prince</hi> and hearkning to his Council: and many a time since when I have had him at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession I have shook hell about his Ears, and made him sigh fear and tremble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would give him absolution; nay more then that I have made him beg for it upon his knees before I would consent to absolve him, by this I saw that he had still an Inclination to me and was willing to be under my government: so I set the basenes of the action before him by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the whole Story and how wicked it was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that it could not be forgiven till he had done some good action to balance that and Expiate the crime, whereupon he at last asked me what he must doe? I told him that he must root out all the Hereticks from his Kingdom, so when he see there was no rest for him without doeing it, he did againe give them all into the power of me and our Clergy: under this Condition <hi>that we should not murder them;</hi> as he had before given orders; but that we should by fair means or force convert them to the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> to which End he gave us his <hi>Dragoons</hi> to be at our devotion and service that we might use them as we saw Convenient to convert them to the true Religion, now when we had got the Comission we presently put it in practise, and what the Issue of it hath been you very well know.</p>
            <p>But now in <hi>England</hi> the work cannot be done after this manner: as you may perceive by what I have said to you, if you have carefully observed what hath been delivered, so that I can not give you better Council then to take that course in hand wherein we were so unhappily prevented, and I doubt not but it will have better succes with you then with us, and the rather because your <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Son</hi> are under the government of our <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> and are to obey the orders of our Generall, and doe all that can be contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the destroying the Hereticks, I would not be here understood as if I thought the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to prosecute and promote our orders and directions for the good of our holy mother the Church: and you must always keep him perfectly possest of that: for I know well that he of himself is Zealous enof, for that Excellent Example in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> that was done by his father [<hi>that is the murdering</hi> 200000 <hi>Protestants</hi>] is still so deeply printed in his soul that he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe it to day then wait till to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, if he saw an advantagions oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and I mention this story of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land that you may press it upon him and by that incourage him how easy a thing it is to do.</p>
            <p>The reason why I am so long in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teing this matter: is to let you know how we had at first laid our designe and also what obstructions there came in the way: yet at last we arrived at the thing we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, so you must not be disheartened when you meet with opposition but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the thing, doe your duty and leave the succes to time and fate.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>King</hi> is at present very sickly and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000438_0009_0FA5AF2BFA847FD0"/>
we can have no account what he ails, for sometimes the <hi>Doctors</hi> say he hath an <hi>Ague,</hi> a while after they say tis the <hi>Gout</hi> and then <hi>Melancholy</hi> or some such thing, now whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her the slow progres of the great designe in the Hague to get the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> into his Interest; <hi>or to murder him;</hi> doth so weaken and impair him, I know not. But this I can assure you of: that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be sick when he received the news of that provokeing answer that the Pensio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naris <hi>Fagel</hi> gave to his Ambasador <hi>D' A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaux:</hi> and was after published in very Scornful terms; and therefore there was but little hope left to accomplish the first: and Indeed less to perform the second, seeing the Prince hath smelt out our Kings designe, and for all those that have intermedled in the affaires of our Amba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador concerning what he hath done for his master; let them look to themselves, possibly he may fear that their <hi>Majestys</hi> of great <hi>Brittain</hi> may alter their opinions about the young prince that we have been so long contriveing for, and at last disowne him, and so destroy the designe, and from thence may his sicknes proceed, for he is considerable better since he hath heard of its good succes and the probabillity of its good conclusion. And this is the more possible because his <hi>Majesty</hi> takes all his Measures from the Constitution of the affaires in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; undertakes nothing of any great importance till he considers how it stands with that <hi>King,</hi> [and you well know that we in the late troubles forbore to persecute the <hi>Hugnoets</hi> till we heard of his <hi>Majestys</hi> conquest and the defeat and death of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and then we began againe very smartly] so hath he now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewise do<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, as soon as he heard this news gave present orders that all those <hi>Hereticks</hi> who were not converted to the Catholick Religion by such a day should be offered up as a Sacrifice to the <hi>young Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I would Intreat you against you write to me againe to Inquire and let me know of what <hi>Lady, Nun,</hi> or other <hi>Holy Virgin</hi> the <hi>young Prince</hi> was born: that I may remember her in my prayers who hath brought this hopefull babe into the world that is like to be the pillar of our Religion, and also send me word how old he was when he was <hi>brought to the Queen</hi> or as the Common cant is when he was born: for there is a Father of our Society that is very skilful in <hi>Astrology</hi> and would Calculate his Nativity.</p>
            <p>I have Received a Letter out of the Hague by which I am told that in <hi>Holland</hi> they use very unreverend Expressions of the <hi>young Prince:</hi> one says that among all the Children you got for this designe there was not one found fit to be used, either they were <hi>sickly, deformed</hi> or born with some other <hi>ill accident:</hi> so that they say this is a <hi>Millers Son:</hi> others say it was a <hi>Carpenters Son in Holborn</hi> thereby intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teing a sacred miracle parallel to the holy Joseph who was of the same trade, others say the <hi>young Prince</hi> was a month old when he was born, and that he could presently eat pap with a spoon, and there are others who say he had six teeth in his mouth and immediately began to bite like a <hi>young De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> which was the onely cause why they would not let him suck, but some others say that he suckt long enof before he was born, and should they now let him suck againe he would goe there to prove a <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonger;</hi> yet there are some that are more Rude and uncivil and report him to be the sonn of a <hi>Plowman,</hi> and say it is no wonder that he is so fat, big boned, and strong made; being designed by nature for the <hi>flaile</hi> and not for the <hi>Throne.</hi> Nay there be some here in <hi>France</hi> that tell us they have heard in the <hi>Taverns</hi> and <hi>Coffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses</hi> nay and a long the streets also in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don as bad language as there and therefore you must as much as possible, endeavor to suppres these things, by giveing orders to <hi>the Marq: d' Albeville</hi> your <hi>Kings</hi> Envoy at the <hi>Hague</hi> to complaine of some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

            <p>I am also Informed that few or none of all the <hi>Heretick Bishops</hi> and <hi>ministers</hi> in the three Kingdoms will pray for the <hi>young Prince</hi> in their Churches, which if true is of ill consequence, and therefore you must endeavor to have it done: and all those Rebellious Hereticks that will not obey his Majestys absolute power in this and other cases must be turned out, and dealt with as I have in this Letter before shewed.</p>
            <p>I would write to you of many other things but that I fear what is here already done doth detaine you to long, and I also well know that you have a weighty affair on your shoulders: and therefore your time is precious, so that you stand in need of the Grace of God and the prayers of all good men to assist you in it: wherefore I will conclude, and for you and all good Catholicks shew my will to the best of my power praying for you to God, to Mary the H.

Months of Gainsayers, but to take care to have it done Regular and publick ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording, to the antient, Custom in that case, that all man kind might be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it was true and Just, but Alas here was the <hi>popes</hi> finger in it and the <hi>French Kings</hi> to: Ergo.</p>

The subtilty they have used to have the Queen delivered in the eight month, and that with so much sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes as if she had not time to call any or give notice to those who ought to have been there, they Judging that the world will think from hence that she was cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched at unawares. But alas this is so far from takeing off the suspicion that it doth much Increase it, for from thence all men must Judge that they made Choice of this opportunity to do it in a private corner in the Dark: it being not fit for the light, for such works and workers hate that, and you need not doubt but they were affraid that some <hi>persons of qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Bishops,</hi> and others would have come [had they knowne of it] that they could not have hindred; and tho it was the custom yet they did not desire their Company on that occasion. Secondly, we must necessaryly, conclude it is a cheat; because all men know that a Child born in the eighth month can not be so perfect lusty and vigorous as one of nine months is; and all that have seen this Child say it is biger and lustyer then ever this Queen had any when she went full nine months, and indeed biger then any new born Child usually is. Thirdly; we have great reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it is a cheat, because all <hi>Physicians</hi> and <hi>Phylosophers</hi> do affirm that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for a Child born in the eighth month to live, but we need not go to those, for Common Experience tels us it is true. Therefore the <hi>Jesuites</hi> who have undertaken to cheat the whole world, should have laid this designe better and have let the Queen been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the seventh month, because a Child of the seventh month may and often times doth live, so that this would have been far more probable to have hid the villany seeing it lay in their power to let her be brought to bed when they pleased, but they did not think upon it, for their wisdom zeal and power hath cheated them, and the mighty <hi>providence of god</hi> hath awakned the world to see the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany of the <hi>Cheat:</hi> a <hi>Cheat</hi> Contrived and managed for no other end but to give the <hi>Inheritance</hi> of the <hi>Crowne</hi> to a stranger, <hi>to Cheat the heir,</hi> and preserve the <hi>papists</hi> from the hand of Justice, to which they and their accomplices have forfeited their Necks for their endeavoring to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Religion,</hi> their <hi>breaking</hi> the laws, and for bringing in a <hi>Bastard</hi> to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the work.</p>

we walk by a more unerring spirit then those who doat upon that <hi>dead Letter,</hi> and make a noise about that man that was crucified at Jerusalem, I need not tell thee how useles the <hi>dead Letter</hi> is especially where there is the <hi>light</hi> within and <hi>miracles</hi> without; nor how foolish it is to beleeve <hi>three persons</hi> in the trinity; nor how ignorant them people are that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him they call <hi>Christ</hi> for their salvation; thou knowest these thing well and therefore they are to thee the less useful and indeed since I have so much to say to thee about other more weighty affaires I must omit these.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding our various disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poinments which we dayly meet with on every side, we keep as close to the Rule and method prescribed as any men in this great affair can do that must ingage with such opposition; the great point at present is that of our young Prince: which me thought would have done far better then it doth, for the Noblemen that are Hereticks laugh at it, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try do not beleeve it, and the Common sort speak such scandalous words of him that I am ashamed to name them.

Among these three hundred he Expected one hundred of them to be women; but the number fell short and unhappily proved to be but seven or eight; of which four of them were very honest women of their bodys haveing onely a whisk with their tailes. As for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of quallity at that court there was none of them present at this Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And should I but tell thee <hi>how Contemptibly</hi> they looked upon the whole matter, and the <hi>Ambasador</hi> also for doeing it, thou woulds Conclude that they had but a very <hi>Indifferent opinion</hi> of the <hi>young Prince,</hi> and what is more, the <hi>young Prince'</hi>s health was not drunk at the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick table; which shews either a great weakness in our <hi>Envoy</hi> or Els the guests were more in love with the wine, then the cause and occasion of their Meeting: and besides I hear he is forbid to be prayed for there in the number of the Royal family which makes me think they do mistrust or have heard something of the matter; and therefore by the next I desive a word or two of thy opinion and what is best to be done in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.</p>

And they also talk of the Queens Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying plaisters and takeing medecines to stop—but you know en of of that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, These and abundance more of such reports is the Common talk and beleef both of City and Country, and the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the worse, and yet <hi>Brother Lob, Brother Alsop, Brother Cox</hi> and many of our freinds the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> take a great deal of Pains in their pulpits to pray for him, and preach up the great blessing that god in him hath bestowed upon the nation: and yet poor Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen they are by the people counted <hi>Rogues</hi> for their pains which is very hard,</p>
            <p>It is the advise and Council of most of our Catholick peers and other well wishers to the cause not to make to much hast, but <hi>Father Peters</hi> says it must be hastened for we do not know how little time we have to work and when the King dyes [which we fear] the work is at an End: Therefore it is Resolved to Cite the Bishops before the Eclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Comissioners againe and to proceed against them with all the force possible, and also to turn out the greatest part of the Clergy for disobedience and in their Roms to put in Non Conformist, and if they do not answer our Ends, or as soon as we see occasion we will turn out them and put in Roman Catholick priests, it was debated whither we should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the advice or not: to cut them all of at once, but upon Examining our <hi>Army and fleet,</hi> we do not think our selves strong enof nor the work yet fit for that Issue. And therefore we will yet talk of a <hi>Parliament</hi> in November, to which End we have our <hi>Trumpeters</hi> in all parts of the towne and some of them pardoned Rebels: these are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ways to the people for an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to their Test: and as one of them very well says <hi>take away the palisado and build a brick wall;</hi> which notion takes with many, but if things should not do to have a Parliament in November we shall by that time perhaps be able to come to the great work, and to that purpose in the mean time we will Entertaine all the popish officiers and souldiers we can get.</p>
            <p>We also resolve to get in to the work such as have been pretended Enemies to the King formerly and these will do our work to our hearts content, for we have picked out a select number of them that Gape after honor and profit, and this they shall not want so long as we have need of their service: these are to take their degrees in preferment and rise as they deserve: the boldest follow riseth first, and he that can with sword, pen,

            </p>
            <p>It is likewise resolved that In case this designe with the Non cons doth not take effect to get a Parliament for our purpose at the time appointed, to lay by all thoughts of smooth means and get in a good number of french privately and and so fall downe right to dragooning: for it is not thought convenient to dally any longer and in the mean time to take up all those we can have proof against, that speak treason against the Prince of Wales and whip hang or imprison them as we see Convenient for if we suffer the people to talk as we do: they will do the same when the Queen shall be brought to bed again [should we see it needful to let this Prince dye] of another Prince of Wales, for you know they must be all boys.</p>
            <p>Tis further more resolved that toward the End of the year the King shall go againe to St. winifreds well and there pray and wash, and against his return the Queen shall prepare her vessel to try a second time how god will bless their Endeavors, and we doubt not but it will succeed well.</p>
            <p>Tis also resolved that in case the King can not get the Test and penal lawes abbrogated to save his freinds harmles after his death, that there shall he always [under pretence of necessity for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions good] vessels of small burden ready to carry them away and save them from hanging: for we do Expect it if he dye; on a sudden.</p>
            <p>I will not detaine thee longer least it may be troublesom to thee: and indeed my time will not permit me to stay longer for I am Just at the finishing of this to go and meet <hi>Brother Alsop: Cox: Jones, Nokes, Lob:</hi> the <hi>King</hi> and some others where we go to Consider of some Important affairs relateing to the Kings bussines.</p>
