            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <hi>PSALM CXXXVII. 5. 6.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>If I forget thee, O Jeruſalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem above my chief joy.</p>

            <p>THE penman of this pſalm is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. He was, probably, ſome holy prophet, prieſt, or Levite, who penned it during his own and his brethren's captivity in Babylon. It has ever been juſtly admired; and attempts have been made by ſome of the firſt poets to render
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037833_0004_100F821FF2C66DA8"/>
it into Engliſh verſe. We regret that he who excelled all others in ſacred poeſy, and who has given an admirable tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of this pſalm,
<q>in its Jewiſh form," ſhould have aſſerted, that it could not well be converted into Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity;</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Watts's Miſcellaneous Thoughts.</note> and has, conſequently, omitted it in his ſyſtem for divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. It appears to admit of an eaſy and uſeful application.</p>
            <p>AS Jeruſalem was a type of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church on earth, and of the general aſſembly of the firſt-born on high, ſo the captive ſtate of the Jews, the ſcoffs which they endured from their enemies, the affectionate remembrance of their former privileges, and their proſpects of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reſtoration, well repreſent the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the Church, and her final triumph; together with the exerciſes of the pious under theſe conſiderations. The words which have been read are beautifully and forcibly expreſſive. To
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037833_0005_100F8222E3DB3300"/>
manifeſt the moſt tender concern for the diſtreſs of Jeruſalem, and anxiety for her deliverance, the form of an imprecation is adopted.
<q>If I forget thee, O Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jeruſalem above my chief joy.</q>
Rather than ſtring their harps for the purpoſe of mirth, they wiſh that they might loſe their ſkill in playing; rather than ceaſe to mourn their deſolate condition, and look forward to the return of proſperity, they wiſh to be deprived of the uſe of their faculties.</p>
            <p>THESE words teach us, my brethren, what ought to be our ſentiment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct with reſpect to the extenſion of the goſpel of Chriſt; and they afford a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſubject of diſcourſe on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. They have been preferred, becauſe Chriſtians appear more to need excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than information as to their duty. There is not one of us who does not
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037833_0006_100F822487EF3830"/>
believe that a time will come when the Chriſtian religion will prevail over the whole earth, and that we are under obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to promote this; but we are too ſeldom aware of the means in our power, and too diſinclined to uſe them. In one word, while we aſſent to the neceſſity and benefit of miſſions, they are either not undertaken, or not ſupported, for want of a miſſionary ſpirit.</p>
            <p>THE deſign then is, ſimply, to deſcribe the temper and practice of thoſe who can ſincerely ſpeak the language of the text.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt place, The enlargement of the Church is to ſuch, an object of their higheſt deſire.
<q>If I prefer not Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem above my chief joy.</q>
To this, riches, honors, and pleaſures yield in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation, and with the greateſt reaſon. The glory of God, and the welfare of mankind are the leading principles which govern the Chriſtian's heart; and theſe are advanced in proportion to the ſucceſs
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037833_0007_100F8227CE4A7E38"/>
of the goſpel. Every ſentiment of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and every benevolent feeling unite in diffuſing the knowledge of the love of God to our loſt world.</p>
            <p>THIS contributes to the temporal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of men, by enlightening their minds, ſubduing their evil paſſions, and directing them in the diſcharge of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they owe to the great Author of all, and to one another. That ſo much miſery is found on this earth ariſes from the partial and imperfect prevalence of the Chriſtian religion. Even where it is profeſſed, it is either miſunderſtood, or corrupted, or the power of it is not felt. Its real tendency is to produce righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and peace; and we are aſſured that this will be the effect when the nations generally embrace it; that
<q>nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt nation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall they learn war any more.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE mere politician conſiders a nation happy when her commerce is extenſive
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037833_0008_100F822D5DE7FD98"/>
and ſecure; when ſhe is tranquil at home, and commands reſpect abroad; he ſees in the revolutions of empires only the workings of human paſſions, and he fondly anticipates a time when civil rights being well underſtood, and free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments eſtabliſhed, a melioration ſhall take place. But he who prefers Jeruſalem above his chief joy, calls
<q>that people happy whoſe God is the Lord;</q>
he views every revolution as connected with and ſubſervient to Meſſiah's reign, and that on this ultimately depends the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the great family of mankind. The fault lies in the innate corruption of our nature. That only which can and will effectually regenerate the world is the religion of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>BUT when we conſider that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Chriſt is the way which God hath provided for the recovery of fallen men to holineſs and happineſs; that without the knowledge of this they muſt ſuffer endleſs miſery in a future ſtate,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037833_0009_100F822EEE518B40"/>
how awfully important to publiſh the tidings of ſalvation! The reflection that the greater part of our race are living in ignorance of the true God, in ſuſpenſe as to what awaits them after death, or in anticipation of divine wrath, and muſt finally ſink under everlaſting deſpair, will excite the moſt lively emotions in the pious heart.<note n="*" place="bottom">

of the difficulties which they muſt neceſſarily encounter, they will not be diſpoſed to magnify theſe, and to dwell upon them ſo as to diſcourage themſelves and others. Every enterpriſe is attended with difficulties. The Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian has nothing to do with theſe, when the path of duty is evident, but to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee and prepare to meet them; leaving the event to God who doeth according to his will, and before whom the mountains often become a plain.</p>
            <p>IT has been ſaid, by way of diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the attempt to ſend the goſpel to the Heathen, that now is not the time which God hath fixed for their converſion. Whence has this information been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? Who has releaſed Chriſtians from the obligation to make conſtant and unwearied exertions? Are not the means and the end connected? And when the former are faithfully uſed, have we not reaſon to believe that the latter will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low? Yea, when the proper methods are
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037833_0012_100F823908E83E30"/>
vigorouſly purſued, may it not be ſaid, that the time is come?</p>
            <p>IT has been objected that it is in vain to ſend the goſpel to a people, until they are civilized? But how are they to be civilized? Will not the perſon who teaches them the things which belong to their everlaſting peace, teach them alſo the arts of civilization, and inculcate the duties of ſobriety and induſtry? Will their meeting together for divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the inſtruction of their children have no effect? Will not theſe gradually check their roving diſpoſition, and ſoften their ferocious nature? So far from wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing until a ſtate of civilization precede the preaching of the goſpel, that theſe muſt go together; or rather, the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chriſtian religion will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally produce the other.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, It has been objected that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes on the frontiers, and even in the interior places of our country, are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037833_0013_100F823A9891B028"/>
of religious inſtruction; and that theſe firſt demand our attention. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be juſtly ſaid that they are ſo deſtitute as the ſavages in the wilderneſs. Many of them once lived under the goſpel; and they either have, or might have now the means of ſalvation. The holy ſcriptures, which teſtify of Chriſt, are acceſſible to them. Beſides miſſionaries are ſent among them by moſt of the Chriſtian denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. Granting their condition to be pitiable, is not the condition of others more to be deplored? Should we not fly to ſave thoſe firſt who are in the greateſt danger of deſtruction? Who have the beſt claim to our benevolence? Thoſe who are deprived of every way of relief, or thoſe who will not uſe it when in their reach?</p>
            <p>IT has been farther ſtarted as a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty that proper miſſionaries cannot be procured. Such perſons ſeem to forget that "the Lord of the harveſt" hath
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037833_0014_100F823D71B86C90"/>
promiſed, and
<q>that he will ſend forth labourers into his harveſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THESE objections will not deter thoſe who are intent on the work. They are anſwered by referring to the grace of the Redeemer, and by an appeal to repeated experience. Had the Apoſtles been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted by dangers of this ſort, they had never gone forth into all the world. Had Paul conſulted with fleſh and blood, he had not been
<q>debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians;</q>
he had never preached the goſpel
<q>from Jeruſalem and round about unto Illyricum.</q>

in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderneſs, in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils in the ſea, in perils among falſe brethren; In wearineſs and painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in watchings often, in hunger and thirſt, in faſtings often, in cold and nakedneſs.</q>

He has left them on record, as if to ſhame the indolence and timidity of thoſe who complain, or to ſhow what can be endured for the croſs of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>THE inſtitution of ſuch ſocieties as of late years have taken place, embracing the different denominations, has a happy tendency to encourage, to animate, and to give efficacy to their efforts. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of a ſingle man is often great; the influence of a number ſtriving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the ſame cauſe is ſtill greater,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037833_0016_100F8246B5902C68"/>
and renders ſucceſs almoſt certain. The expreſſion uſed in the addreſs of one of the Miſſionary Societies in Britain,<note n="*" place="bottom">Edinburgh.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys a noble and affecting idea;

            </p>
            <p>IN the third place, Thoſe who feel the ſpirit expreſſed by the Jewiſh captives in the text, will make the cauſe of the Church matter of earneſt and repeated ſupplications to the throne of grace. As the ſucceſs of the goſpel is uppermoſt in their thoughts and what they moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently deſire, ſo they will plead with God
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037833_0017_100F82484F7F5C88"/>
that every obſtacle may be removed, and that "all fleſh may ſee his ſalvation." "Ye that make mention of the Lord," ſays the prophet,

            <p>HOW conſolatory to Chriſtians to know that though ſome of them may be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of other means of affording aſſiſtance, yet they can all help by their prayers! And what encouragement to Miſſionaries ſtruggling with difficulties, that they have acceſs to Him who heareth prayer, and are aſſured that they are continually remembered by the faithful in every part of the world!</p>
            <p>BESIDES the ſecret addreſſes to God, thoſe who are truly engaged for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the Redeemer's kingdom, will meet together, and unite in their ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. To this exerciſe a bleſſing is promiſed. Hear the words of our Lord!

            <p>THESE ſocieties for miſſionary efforts, and for prayer, are the more pleaſing, and promiſe to be attended with the greater advantage, becauſe they conſiſt of thoſe of various denominations. Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in things ſmall and uneſſential, they

ſumptuouſly every day, they hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow a thought on the millions who pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for lack of knowledge. Even the <hi>crumbs</hi> which fall from their tables, the ſuperfluities of fortune, are refuſed.</p>
            <p>THE objection has been ſometimes made, that were there an opportunity of eſtabliſhing miſſions in this country, Chriſtians are not ſufficiently numerous and wealthy for the purpoſe. A little conſideration will teach us, that the only danger is in the want of union and zeal. If united, they can accompliſh more than they are aware of; and if zealous, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant means can be produced. Do we not find individuals and companies pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing immenſe tracts of land, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing banks, building palaces, and freight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing veſſels with the richeſt treaſures? Whence all theſe things? Whence do men derive the means for theſe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, and yet when ſolicited to give for religious uſes their right hands forget their cunning? They are withered and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037833_0022_100F82584155DBA0"/>
cannot be ſtretched forth? Is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they forget Jeruſalem, and ſet her proſperity below their chief joy? Infidels may ſneer, and carnal profeſſors ſtart alarmed as though they feared to be robbed of their gods, but let them know that accurſed is every thing which is not ſubſervient to the croſs of Chriſt; and that whoſoever ſacrilegiouſly withholds from God, his money ſhall periſh with him, the ruſt of it ſhall witneſs againſt him, and ſhall eat his fleſh as it were fire.</p>
            <p>BUT there is no neceſſity for ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands upon Chriſtians as would deprive them of a ſingle convenience or even comfort in life. There is an abundance for the work, of what the poſſeſſors can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly enjoy; yea, of what is a burden to them, and may be a real inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their poſterity. None will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand me as inveighing againſt induſtry and enterpriſe in the concerns of this world, or againſt a liberal proviſion for our houſeholds. Suffer me, however, to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037833_0023_100F825A92240330"/>
ſay, and to aſk every one in this aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to mark it, that the honor and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of wealth lie ſingly in its proper uſe. It makes eminent when it is made the inſtrument of eminent good.</p>
            <p>WHEN God requires our ſouls, whoſe ſhall thoſe things be which we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided? When at death, O man, thy right hand ſhall forget her cunning, and thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, will it be a pleaſure to reflect that thou never uſedſt either for the glory of God? Hadſt thou remembered Jeruſalem, and preferred her above thy chief joy, thou wouldſt have had a place there; but now thou art ſhut out, and thy ſhort-lived joys are followed by endleſs torments!</p>
            <p>ADMITTING that the rich worldling ſhould ſtill withhold his gifts, there is no occaſion for deſpair. All who are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the importance of the deſign will contribute time after time, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their ability; and God will gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly

            <p>WITH the inſtitution of a Miſſionary Society in this city, the principal object of which is to ſend the goſpel to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian tribes, you are well acquainted.

that the Directors employed, during the winter, an additional perſon as a catechiſt, and who is alſo a mechanic; and that both theſe perſons with their wives and twelve children began their journey, in the ſtate of Vermont, on the 13th day of laſt month, and are now on their way to the Chickaſaw country.

from all who prefer Jeruſalem above their chief joy. At firſt it ſeemed matter of experiment, and ſome doubted; but every encouragement which can be rationally expected is now given.

            <p>IN their report of November 14th, 1799, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors ſtated, in general, the arrival of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary, the Rev. Joſeph Bullen, among the Chicka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw Indians, and their favourable diſpoſitions towards him, although he had not been formally acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the nation. They have it now in their power to communicate to the Society, the very pleaſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, that his reception has been friendly and flattering even beyond expectation. The Indians appear to have vied with each other in their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to him, and his ſon who accompanied him; and to have liſtened with reſpect and reverence to his religious inſtructions. It will readily occur that during Mr. Bullen's ſhort reſidence in the Indian country, viz. from the 20th May till the 4th of September 1799, no great progreſs in the work of his miſſion could reaſonably be expected. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037833_0033_100F8279A5C8B6D8"/>
of language and of manners, the impoſſibility of procuring proper interpreters, and the difficulty of procuring any worthy of confidence; the ſtate of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian ſociety, and the jealouſy of the Indian temper, are obſtacles which time, patience, and perſeverance are neceſſary to remove. Yet, under all theſe diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, added to the affliction of broken health, and the ſevere ſickneſs of his ſon, Mr. Bullen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have laboured with fidelity, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect. One of the Chickaſaw chiefs has been prevailed upon to ſet up the worſhip of God in his family: Others are cheerful in promoting the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the goſpel into the nation; and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, of whom it poſſeſſes conſiderable numbers, have diſcovered much anxiety to learn the things which belong to their peace. Several of them came miles to hear Mr. Bullen preach and catechiſe, and ſome of them ſeemed ſo to embrace the word of life, that he thought himſelf warranted to adminiſter bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to one family, viz. a father and four children.</p>
            <p>The Indian diet and mode of living in general diſagreeing with his conſtitution, ſo as gradually to impair his health and ſtrength ſo far as to incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him for the comfortable diſcharge of miſſionary duties, and his ſon having been brought, by diſeaſe, to the brink of the grave, Mr. Bullen thought it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to leave the country for a while and return home. He took his departure accordingly on the 4th of September, with the regrets of the chiefs and nation. He was eſcorted a conſiderable diſtance on
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:037833_0034_100F827BDB6F25C8"/>
his journey, and parted with them after receiving their earneſt ſolicitations to come back as ſpeedily as poſſible. Two addreſſes to the board of Directors, one from Wolf's friend, the head man of the nation, and another from General William Colbert and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor George Colbert, both chiefs of influence, officially requeſted that Mr. Bullen might return without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, and bring his family to ſettle among them They alſo requeſted that the board would ſend ſome other perſons who could teach them ſome of the arts of civilized life, and promiſed lands during their continuance in the country, and ſuch other ſuccours as it ſhould be in their power to give.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of this application, the Directors thought it their duty, and of high importance to the objects of this Society, to attempt the formation of a ſmall religious ſettlement in the Chickaſaw country. For this purpoſe they have connected in the miſſion with Mr. Bullen and his family, Deacon Ebenezer Rice and his family. With Mr. Rice, both from reſpectable information, and perſonal interview, they have every reaſon to be ſatisfied, as a man of evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical principles and experimental godlineſs, and one well qualified to aſſiſt Mr. Bullen as a catechiſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his uſefulneſs in catechiſing, Mr. Rice, from his mechanical ſkill, will be able to aſſiſt the Indians in the conſtruction of houſes, mills and looms. From his family and that of Mr. Bullen's jointly, they will learn agriculture and ſeveral of the domeſtic arts. While the females will be of eminent ſervice in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:037833_0035_100F827F24F76100"/>
the Indian women. A number of perſons of other occupations were willing to accompany the million. But the Directors, having adopted, as a fundamental principle, the reſolution of not employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any who ſhould not be primarily devoted to the propagation of the glorious goſpel, and with whom improvements, merely civil, ſhould not be a ſecondary object, and having nothing to convince them that the applicants are of this deſcription, were obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the offer.</p>
            <p>Mr. Bullen, therefore, and Mr. Rice, with their families, agreed to go, by themſelves, on the noble and generous enterpriſe. They ſet off on the 13th inſtant, and are now proſecuting their journey.</p>
            <p>The number of perſons belonging to the Miſſion is as follows:
