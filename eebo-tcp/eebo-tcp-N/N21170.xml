            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>MANY young Readers doubtleſs remember to have met with a Book, which gives an account of a little boy named Henry, and his ſiſter Charlotte, who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged by their Mamma, with walking in the fields and gardens, where ſhe taught them to take particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of every object that preſented itſelf to their view. The conſequence of this was, that they contracted a great fondneſs for animals and uſed to expreſs a wiſh, that their Birds, Cats, Dogs, &amp;c. could talk, that they might hold converſation with them. Their mamma, therefore to amuſe them compoſed the following Fabulous Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; in which the ſentiments and affections of a good Father and Mother, and a Family of Children, are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be poſſeſſed by a neſt of Redbreaſts; and others of the feathered race are, by the force of imagination, endued with the ſame faculties: but, before Henry and Charlotte began to read theſe Hiſtories they were taught to conſider them, not as containing the real converſation of Birds. (for that it is impoſſible we ſhould ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,) but as a ſeries of <hi>FABLES,</hi> intended to convey moral inſtruction applicable to themſelves, at the ſame time that they excite compaſſion and tenderneſs for thoſe intereſting and delightful creatures, on which ſuch wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton cruelties are frequently inflicted, and recommend <hi>univerſal Benevolence.</hi>

               <p>IN a hole, which time had made, in a wall covered with ivy, a pair of RED-BREASTS built their neſt. No place could have been better choſen for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; it was ſheltered from the rain, ſkreened from the wind, and in an orchard belonging to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had ſtrictly charged his domeſtics not to deſtroy the labours of thoſe little ſongſters, which choſe his ground as an aſylum.</p>
               <p>In this happy retreat, which no idle ſchool-boy dared to enter, the hen Redbreaſt depoſited four eggs, and then took her ſeat upon them; reſolving that nothing ſhould tempt her to leave the neſt, till ſhe had hatched her infant brood. Her tender mate every morning brought her food, before he taſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelf, and then cheered her with a ſong.</p>
               <p>At length the day arrived, when the happy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heard the chirping of her little ones; pleaſing to her ears, as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>attle of a beloved child, to its fond parent; with inexpreſſible tenderneſs ſhe ſpread her maternal wings to cover them, threw out the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027817_0009_0FD64EA6DAF152D8"/>
egg-ſhells in which they before lay confined, then preſſed them to her boſom, and preſented them to her mate, who viewed them with rapture, and ſeated himſelf by her ſide, that he might ſhare her pleaſure.</p>
               <p>We may promiſe ourſelves much delight in rearing our little family, ſaid he, but it will occaſion us a great deal of trouble; I would willingly bear the whole fatigue myſelf, but it will be impoſſible for me with my utmoſt labour and induſty, to ſupply all our neſtlings with what is ſufficient for their daily ſupport; it will therefore be neceſſary for you to leave the neſt occaſionly, in order ſometimes to ſeek proviſions for them. She declared her readineſs to take a flight whenever it would be requiſite: and ſaid, that there would be no neceſſity for her to be long abſent, ſhe had in her laſt excurſion diſcovered a place near the orchard where food was ſcattered on purpoſe for ſuch birds as would take the pains of ſeeking it; and had been informed by a Chaffinch, that there was no kind of danger in picking it up. This is a lucky diſcovery indeed, replied he, and we muſt avail ourſelves of it; for this great increaſe of family renders it prudent to make uſe of every expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for ſupplying our neceſſities! I myſelf, muſt take a large circuit, for ſome inſects that are proper for the neſtlings cannot be found in all places: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I will bear you compa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y whenever it is in my power. The little ones now began to feel the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:027817_0010_0FD64EA935AE5328"/>
of hunger, and opening their gaping mouths for food; on which their kind father inſtantly fled forth to ſeek it for them, and in turns ſupplied them all, as well as his beloved mate. This was a hard day's work, and when evening came on, he was glad to ſeek repoſe; therefore, turning his head under his wing, he ſoon fell aſleep; his mate fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his example; the four little ones had before fallen into a gentle ſlumber, and perfect quietneſs for ſome hours reigned in the neſt.</p>
               <p>The next morning they were awakened at the dawn of day, by the ſong of ſkylark, who had a neſt near the orchard; and as the young Redbreaſts were clamorous for food, their father cheerfully prepared himſelf to renew his toil, but firſt requeſted his mate to accompany him to the place ſhe had mentioned. That I will do, replied ſhe, at a proper hour, but it is too early yet; I muſt, therefore, entreat that you will go by yourſelf, and procure a breakfaſt for us, as I am fearful of leaving the neſtlings before the air is warmer, leſt they ſhould be chilled. To this he readily conſented, and fed all his little darlings, to whom for the ſake of diſtinction, I ſhall give the names of Robin, Dicky, Flapſy, and Peckſy. When this kind of office was performed, he perched on an
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:027817_0011_0FD64EAA9DD57F38"/>

               <p>No ſooner did they appear before the parlour win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow than it was haſtily thrown up by Miſs Harriet Benſon, a little girl about eleven years old, the daughter of the Gentleman and Lady to whom the houſe belonged.</p>
               <p>Miſs Harriot with great delight, called her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſee two Robin Redbreaſts: Her ſummons was inſtantly complied with, and ſhe was joined by Maſter Frederick, a fine chubby roſy-cheek boy, about ſix years of age, who as ſoon as he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I muſt have a great piece of bread this morning ſaid he, for there are all the Sparrows and Chaffinches that come every day, and two Robin Redbreaſts beſides. Here is a piece for you, Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick replied Mrs. Benſon, cutting a roll that was on the table; but if your daily penſioners continue to increaſe, as they have done lately, we muſt provide ſome other food for them, as it is not right to cut
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027817_0012_0FD64DF6A3DC7F08"/>
pieces from a leaf on purpoſe for birds, becauſe there are many children that want bread to whom we ſhould give the preference. Would you deprive a poor lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>le hungry boy of his breakfaſt, to give it to birds? No, ſaid Frederick, I would ſooner give up my own breakfaſt to a poor boy, than he ſhould go without. But where ſhall I get victuals enough for my birds? I will beg the cook to ſave all the crumbs in the bread pan, and deſire John to preſerve all he makes, when he cuts the loaf for dinner, and thoſe which are ſcattered on the table-cloth. A very good ſche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>vail on the ſervants to indulge you. I cannot bear to ſee the leaſt fragment of food waſted, which may conduce to the ſupport of life in any creature?</p>
               <p>Miſs Harriet being quite impatient to exerciſe her benevolence, requeſted her brother to remember that the poor birds, for whom he had been a ſucceſsful ſolicitor, would ſoon fly away, if he did not make haſte to feed them; on which he ran to the window with his treaſure in his hand.</p>
               <p>When Miſs Harriet firſt appeared, the winged ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants approached with eager expectation of the

daily handful, which their kind benefactreſs made it a cuſtom to diſtribute, and were ſupprized at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of her charity. They hopped around the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow —they chirped—they twittered, and employed all their little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Dicky! On hearing the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known ſound of invitation, the little flock immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately drew near—Maſter Frederick held a ſhort conteſt with his ſiſter, in order to prevail with her to let him feed all the birds himſelf; but finding that he could not fling the crums far enough for the Redbreaſts, who with the timidity of Strangers, kept at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Maſter Frederick exclaimed with rapture, that the two Robin Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaſts were feeding! and Miſs Harriet meditated a deſign of taming them, by repeated inſtances of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Be ſure, my dear brother, ſaid ſhe not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to aſk the cook and John for the crumbs; and do not let the leaſt little morſel of any thing you have

Hold, my love, ſaid Mrs. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though I commend your humanity, I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind you again, that there are poor people as well as poor birds. Well, mamma, replied Frederick, I will only buy a little ſeed then. As he ſpake the laſt words, the Redbreaſts having finiſhed their meal, the mother bird expreſſed her impatience to return to the neſt; and having obtained her mate's conſent, repaired with all poſſible ſpeed to her humble habitation, whilſt he tuned his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>MASTER BENSON expreſſed great concern that the Robins were gone; but was comforted by his ſiſter, who reminded him, that in all probability his new favourites having met with ſo kind a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,

would return on the morrow. Mrs. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then bid them ſhut the window, and taking Frederick in her lap, and deſiring Miſs Harriet to ſit down by her, thus addreſſed them.</p>
               <p>I am delighted, my dear children, with your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane behaviour towards the animal creation, and wiſh by all means to encourage it. But though a moſt commendable propenſity, it requires regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; let me therefore recommend to you, not to ſuffer it to gain upon you to ſuch a degree, as to make you unhappy or forgetful of thoſe, who have a ſuperior claim to your attention: I mean poor people; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways keep in mind the diſtreſſes which they endure, and on no account waſte any kind of food, nor give to inferior animals what is deſigned for mankind.</p>

                  </gap>iet promiſed to follow her mamma's inſtructions; but Frederick's attention was entirely engaged by watching a Butterfly, which had juſt left the chryſalis, and was fluttering in the window, longing to try its wings in the air and ſun-ſhine. This Frederick was very deſirous of catching, but his mamma would not permit him to attempt it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſhe told him) he could not well lay hold of its wings without doing it an injury, and it would be much happier at liberty. Should you like, Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick. ſaid ſhe, when you are going out to play, to have any body lay hold on you violently, ſcratch you all over, then offer you ſomething to eat which is very diſagreeable, and perhaps poiſonous, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027817_0016_0FD64DD9A1C1CCC8"/>
then ſhut you up in a little dark room? And yet this is the fate to which many an harmleſs inſect is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by thoughtleſs children. As ſoon as Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick underſtood that he could not catch the butterfly without hurting it, he gave up the point, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his mamma, he did not want to keep it, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to carry it out of doors. Well, replied ſhe, that end may be anſwered by opening the window which at her deſire was done by Miſs Harriet; the happy inſect ſeized the opportunity of eſcaping, and Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick had ſoon the pleaſure of ſeeing it on a roſe-tree.</p>
               <p>Breakfaſt being ended, Mrs. Benſon reminded the young lady and gentleman, that it was almoſt time for their leſſons to begin; but deſired their maid to take them into the garden before the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> applied to buſineſs, whilſt ſhe gave ſome direction in the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and Maſter Frederick, during his walk, amuſed himſelf with watching the Butterfly, as it flew from flower to flower which gave more pleaſure than he could poſſibly have received from catching and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining the little tender creature.</p>
               <p>Let us now ſee what became of our Redbreaſts, after they left their young benefactors. The hen as I informed you, repaired immediately to the neſt; her heart fluttered with apprehenſion as ſhe entered it, and ſhe eagerly called out, "are you all ſafe, my little dears?" All ſafe, my good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027817_0017_0FD64DDB5E9B8E58"/>
replied Peckſy, but a little hungry, and very cold. Well, ſaid ſhe, your laſt complaint I can ſoon remove; but in reſpect to ſatisfying your hunger, that muſt be your father's taſk, for I have not been able to bring any thing good for you to eat; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he will ſoon be here, I make no doubt. Then ſpreading her wings over them all, ſhe ſoon commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated warmth to them, and they were again com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. In a very ſhort time her mate returned, for he only ſtaid at Mr. Benſon's to finiſh his ſong, and refreſh himſelf with ſome clear water, which his new friends always kept in the place where they fed the birds, on purpoſe for their little penſioners. He brought in his mouth a worm, which was given to Robin; and was going to fetch one for Dicky, but that his mate reminded him of their agreement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to divide betwixt them the care of providing for the family. My young ones are now hatched, ſaid ſhe, and you can keep them warm as well as myſelf; take my place therefore and the next excurſion ſhall be mine. I conſent, anſwered he, with the more pleaſure, becauſe I think a little flying now and then will do you good; but to ſave you the trouble of a painful ſearch, I can direct you to a ſpot, where you may be certain of finding worms enough for this morning's ſupply. He then deſcribed the place; and immediately on her quitting the neſt entered it, and gathered his young ones under his wings.—
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:027817_0018_0FD64DDF8A42C908"/>
Come, my dears, ſaid he, let us ſee what kind of a nurſe I can make: but an aukward one, I fear; even every mother bird is not a good nurſe; but you are very fortunate in your's, for ſhe is an exceeding tender one, and I hope you will make her a dutiful return for her kindneſs. They all promiſed him they would: well, then, ſaid he, I will ſing you a ſong. He did ſo, and it was a very merry one, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the neſtlings extremely: ſo that though they lay a little inconveniently under his wings, they did not regard it, nor think the time of their mother's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence long; ſhe had not ſucceeded in the place ſhe firſt went to, as a boy was picking up worms to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with, of whom ſhe was afraid, and therefore flew farther: but as ſoon as ſhe obtained what ſhe went for, ſhe returned with all poſſible ſpeed; and notwithſtanding ſhe had repeated invitations from ſeveral gay birds which ſhe met, to join their ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive parties, ſhe kept a ſteady courſe, preferring the pleaſure of feeding little Dicky, to all the diverſions of the fields and groves. As ſoon as ſhe came near the neſt her mate ſtarted up to make room for her, and take his turn of providing for his family. Once more adieu! ſaid he, and was out of ſight in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</p>
               <p>Well, my neſtlings, ſaid the mother, how do you do? Very well, thank you, replied all at once; and we have been very merry, ſaid Robin, for my father
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027817_0019_0FD64DE27A343138"/>
has ſung us a ſweet ſong. I think, ſaid Dicky, I ſhould like to learn it. Well, replied the mother, he will teach it you I dare ſay: here he comes, aſk him. I am aſhamed ſaid Dicky. Then you are a ſilly bird, replied ſhe. Never be aſhamed, but when you commit a fault; aſking your father to teach you to ſing, is not one; and good parents de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to teach their young ones every thing that is proper and uſeful. Whatever ſo good a father ſets you an example of, you may ſafely deſire to imitate. Then addreſſing herſelf to her mate, who for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſtopped at the entrance of the neſt, that he might not interrupt her inſtructions. Am I not right, ſaid he, in what I have juſt told them? Perfectly ſo, replied he, I ſhall have pleaſure in teaching them all that is in my power; but we muſt talk of that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time. Who is to feed poor Peckſy? Oh! I, I, anſwered the mother, and was going in an inſtant, And ſo you want to learn to ſing, Dicky? ſaid the father. Well then, I will repeat my ſong, ſo pray liſten very attentively; you may learn the notes, though you will not be able to practiſe them till your voice is ſtronger. He then ſung with the ſame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation as before.</p>
               <p>Robin now remarked that it was very pretty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and expreſſed his deſire to learn it alſo. By all means, ſaid his father, I will ſing it very often, ſo you may learn it if you pleaſe. For my part, ſaid
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:027817_0020_0FD64DE40D31F1E8"/>
Flapſy, I do not think I could have patience to learn it, it will take ſo much time.—Nothing, my dear Flapſy, anſwered the father, can be acquired with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out patience, and I am ſorry to find your's begin to fail you already: But I hope, if you have no taſte for muſic, that you will give the greater application to things that may be of more importance to you. Well, ſaid Peckſy, I would apply to muſic with all my heart, but I do not believe it poſſible for me to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. Perhaps not replied her father, but I do not doubt your application to whatever your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther requires of you, and ſhe is an excellent judge both of your talents, and of what is ſuitable to your ſtation in life. She is no ſongſter herſelf, and yet ſhe is very clever, I aſſure you. Here ſhe comes. Then riſing to make room for her, take your ſeat, my love, ſaid he and I will perch upon the ivy. The hen again covered her brood, whilſt her mate amuſed her with his ſinging and converſation, till evening reminded them of repoſe; excepting, that each made alternate excurſions, as the appetites of their young ones required.</p>
               <p>In this manner ſeveral days paſſed with little vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the neſtlings were very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ving, and daily gained ſtrength and knowledge, through the care and attention of their indulgent parents, who every day viſit their friends, Maſter and Miſs Benſon. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick had been ſucceſsful in his application to both

the cook and footman, by whoſe aſſiſtance he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enough for his dear birds, as he called them, without infringing on the rights of the poor; and he was ſtill able to produce a halfpenny, whenever his papa or mamma pointed out to him a proper object of Charity.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>IT happened one day, that both the Redbreaſts, who always went together to Mr. Benſon's (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if one had waited for the other's return, it would have miſſed the chance of being fed) it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, I ſay, that they were both abſent longer than uſual, for their little benefactors having been fatigued with a very long walk the evening before, lay late in bed that morning; but as ſoon as Frederick was dreſſed his ſiſter, who was waiting for him, took him by the hand, and led him down ſtairs, where he haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily demanded of the cook the collection of crumbs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for him. As ſoon as he entered the breakfaſt parlour, he ran eagerly to the window, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to fling it up. What is the cauſe of this mighty buſtle? ſaid his mamma. Do you not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that I am in the room, Frederick? Oh, my
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:027817_0022_0FD64DE8E5256A28"/>
birds! my birds! cried he. I underſtand, rejoined Mrs. Benſon, that you have neglected to feed your little penſioners: how came this about, Harriet? We were ſo tired laſt night, anſwered Miſs Benſon, that we overſlept ourſelves, mamma. This excuſe may ſatisfy you and your brother, added the Lady, but I fear your birds would bring heavy complaints againſt you were they able to talk our language. But make haſte to ſupply their preſent wants; and for the future, whenever you give any living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cauſe to depend on you for ſuſtenance, be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful on no account to diſappoint it; and if you are prevented feeding it yourſelf, employ another perſon to do it for you. But though it is very commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and indeed an obligation to our humanity, to be attentive to your dependants, yet you muſt not let this make you forgetful of your duty to your friend. It is cuſtomary for little boys and girls to pay their reſpects to their papa's and mamma's every morning, as ſoon as they ſee them. This, Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick, you ought to have done to me, on entering the parlour, inſtead of tearing acroſs it, crying out my birds! my birds! it would have taken you but a very little time to have done ſo: however, I will excuſe your neglect now, my dear, as you did not
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:027817_0023_0FD64DE9F259D0F8"/>
intend to offend me; but I expect that you will ſo manage the buſineſs you have undertaken, that it may not break in on your obligations. You depend as much on your papa and me, for every thing you want, as theſe little birds do on you: nay more ſo, for they could ſupply their own wants, by ſeeking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> but children can do nothing towards their ſupport: therefore it is particularly requiſite, that they would be dutiful and reſpectful to thoſe, whoſe tenderneſs and care are conſtantly exerted for their bene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Miſs Harriet promiſed her mamma, that ſhe would on all occaſions, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to behave as ſhe wiſhed her to do; but I am ſorry to ſay, Frederick was more intent on open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the window, than on imbibing the good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions that were giving him: this he could not effect, and therefore Harriet, by her mamma's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, went to his aſſiſtance, and the ſtore of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions was diſpenſed. As many of the birds had neſts, they eat their meal with all poſſible expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; amongſt this number were the Robins, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched this buſineſs as ſoon as they could, for the hen was anxious to return to her little ones, and the cock to procure them a breakfaſt; and having giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his young friends a ſerenade, before they left
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:027817_0024_0FD64DEB5F6333B8"/>
their bed chambers, he did not think it neceſſary to ſtay to ſing any more, they therefore departed. When the mother-bird arrived at the ivy wall, ſhe ſtopt at the entrance of the neſt, with a palpitating heart; but ſeeing her brood all ſafe and well, ſhe haſtened to take them under her wings. As ſoon as ſhe was ſeated ſhe obſerved that they were not ſo cheerful as uſual. What is the matter? ſaid ſhe, How have you agreed during my abſence? To theſe queſtions all were unwilling to reply, for the truth was that they had been quarrelling almoſt the whole time. What all ſilent? ſaid ſhe; I fear you have not obeyed my commands, but have been contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I deſire you will tell me the truth. Robin knowing that he was the greateſt offender, began to juſtify himſelf, before the others could have time to lay an accuſation againſt him.</p>
               <p>I am ſure, mother, ſaid he, I only gave Dicky a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle peck becauſe he crowded me ſo, and all the others joined with him, and fell upon me at once.</p>
               <p>Since you have begun, Robin, anſwered Dicky, I muſt ſpeak, for you gave me a very hard peck indeed, and I was afraid you had put out my eye. I am ſure I made all the room I could for you; but you ſaid you ought to have half the neſt, and to be maſter
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:027817_0025_0FD64DEF2CA824E8"/>
when your father and mother were out, becauſe you are the eldeſt·</p>
               <p>I do not love to tell tails, ſaid Flapſy, but what Dicky ſays is very true, Robin; and you plucked two or three little feathers out of me, only becauſe I begged you not to uſe us ill.</p>
               <p>And you ſet your foot very hard upon me, cried Peckſy, for telling you that you had forgot your dear mother's injunction.</p>
               <p>This is a ſad ſtory indeed, ſaid the mother. I am very ſorry to find, Robin, that you already diſcover ſuch a turbulent diſpoſition. If you go on in this manner, we ſhall have no peace in the neſt, nor can I leave it with any degree of ſatisfaction· As for your being the eldeſt, though it makes me ſhew you a preference on all proper occaſions, it does not give you a privilege to domineer over your brother and ſiſters. You are all equally the objects of our tender care, which we ſhall exerciſe equally amongſt you, provided you do not forfeit it by bad behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. To ſhew you that you are not maſter of the neſt, I deſire you to get from under my wing, and ſit on the outſide, whilſt I cheriſh thoſe who are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and good. Robin, greatly mortified, retired from his mother; on which Dicky, with the utmoſt kindneſs, began to intercede for him. Pardon Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, my dear mother, I entreat you, ſaid he, I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily forgive his treatment of me, and would not have complained to you, had it not been neceſſary for my
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:027817_0026_0FD64DF218D982E0"/>
own juſtification. You are a good bird, Dicky, ſaid his mother, but ſuch an offence as this muſt be repented of before it is pardoned. At this inſtant her mate returned with a fine worm, and looked as uſual for Robin, who lay ſkulking by himſelf. Give it, ſaid the mother, to Dicky, Robin muſt be ſerved laſt this morning; nay, I do not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhall permit him to have any victuals all day. Dicky was very unwilling to mortify his brother, but on his mother's commanding him not to detain his father, he opened his mouth and ſwallowed the delicious mouthful. What can be the matter, ſaid the good father, when he had emptied his mouth ſurely none of the little ones have been naughty? But I cannot ſtop to enquire at preſent, for I left another fine worm which may be gone if I do not make haſte back.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he departed, Dicky renewed his ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that Robin might be forgiven; but as he ſat ſwelling with anger and diſdain, becauſe he fancied that the eldeſt ſhould not be ſhoved to the outſide of his mother's wing, whilſt the others were fed, ſhe would not hear a word in his behalf. The father ſoon came and fed Flapſy, and then, thinking it beſt for his mate to continue her inſtructions, he made another excurſion; during which Peckſy, whoſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle heart was full of affectionate concern for the puniſhment of her brother, thus attempted to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:027817_0027_0FD64DF4076D61E8"/>Dear Robin, do not grieve, I will give you my breakfaſt, if my mother will let me. O, ſaid Robin, I do not want any breakfaſt; If I may not be ſerved <hi>firſt,</hi> I will have <hi>none.</hi> Shall I aſk my mother to forgive you? I don't want any of your interceſſions, replied he, if you had not been a parcel of ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured things, I ſhould not have been puſhed about as I am.</p>
               <p>Come back, Peckſy, ſaid the mother, who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard them, I will not have you hold converſe with ſo naughty a bird. I forbid every one even to go near him. The father then arrived, and Peckſy was fed. You may reſt yourſelf, my dear, ſaid the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you morning's taſk is ended. Why, what has Robin done? aſked he. What I am ſorry to relate, ſhe replied: Quarrelled with his brother and ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters! Quarrelled with his brother and ſiſters! You ſurpriſe me: I could not have ſuſpected he would have been ſo fooliſh or ſo unkind.—O, this is not all, ſaid the mother, for he preſumes on being the eldeſt, and claims half the neſt to himſelf when we are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and now is fallen, becauſe he is diſgraced, and not fed firſt as uſual. If that is the caſe, replied the father, leave me to ſettle this buſineſs, my dear, and pray go into the air a little, for you ſeem to be ſadly agitated. I am diſturbed, ſaid ſhe, I confeſs; for after all my care and ſolicitude, I did not expect ſuch a ſad recompence as this. I am ſorry to expoſe this perverſe bird, even to you, but he reſiſts my ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efforts

               <p>As ſoon as the mother departed, the father thus addreſſed the delinquent. And ſo, Robin, you want to be maſter of the neſt? A pretty maſter you will make indeed, who do not know even how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern your own temper! I will not ſtand to talk much to you now, becauſe in your preſent diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you would in all probability turn a deaf ear to my admonitions; but depend upon it, I will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to uſe any of the family ill, particularly your good mother, and if you perſiſt in obſtinacy, I will certainly turn you out of the neſt before you can fly. Theſe threatenings intimidated Robin, and he alſo began to be very hungry as well as cold; he therefore promiſed to behave better for the future, and his brother and ſiſters pleaded earneſtly that he might be forgiven and reſtored to his uſual place. I can ſay nothing in reſpect to the laſt particular, replied the father, that depends upon his mother; but as it is his firſt offence, and he ſeems to be very ſorry, I will myſelf pardon it, and intercede for him with his mother, who I fear is at this time la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting his obdur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and longs to aſk your forgiveneſs. Pleaſed at this intelligence, the mother raiſed her drooping head, and cloſed her wings, which hung mournfully by her ſides, expreſſive of the dejection of her ſpirits. I fly to give it him ſaid ſhe, and haſtened into the neſt. In the mean while Robin wiſhed for, yet dreaded her return. As ſoon as he ſaw her, he lifted up a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating eye, and with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I accept your ſubmiſſion, Robin, ſaid ſhe, and will once more receive you to my wing; but indeed your behaviour has made me very unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. She then made room for him, he neſtled cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to her ſide, and ſoon found the benefit of her foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering heat; but the pain of hunger ſtill remained, yet he had not confidence to aſk his father to fetch him any victuals: but this kind parent waited not for ſolicitation, for ſeeing that his mother had received him into favour, he went with all ſpeed to an adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent field, where he ſoon met with refreſhment for him, which with tender love he preſented, and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin ſwallowed with gratitude.

               <p>A FEW days after, a freſh diſturbance took place. All the little Redbreaſts, excepting Peckſy, in turn committed ſome fault or other, for which they were occaſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This excited the envy of the others and they joined together to treat her ill, giving her the title of the <hi>Favourite;</hi> ſaying, that they made no doubt their father and mother would reſerve the <hi>niceſt morſels</hi> for their <hi>darling.</hi> Poor Peckſy bore all their reproaches with patience hoping that ſhe ſhould in time regain their good opinion by her gentleneſs and affection. But it happened one day, that in the midſt of their taunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings their mother unexpectedly returned, who hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an uncommon noiſe among her young ones, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped on the ivy to learn the cauſe; and as ſoon as ſhe diſcovered it, made her appearance at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the neſt, with a countenance that indicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her knowledge of their procedings, and her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure at them. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

cauſe to reproach either your father or me with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality? Do we not with the exacteſt equality, diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the fruits of our labours among you? And in what reſpect has poor Peckſy the preference, but in that commendation which is juſtly her due, and which you do not ſtrive to deſerve? Has ſhe ever yet utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a complaint againſt you, though from the dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her countenance, which ſhe in vain attempted to conceal, it is evident that ſhe has ſuffered your reproaches for ſome days paſt. I poſitively com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you to treat her other wiſe, for it is a mother's duty to ſuccour a perſecuted neſtling! and I will certainly admit her next my heart, and baniſh you all from that place you have hitherto poſſeſſed in it, if you ſuffer envy and jealouſy to poſſes your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, to the excluſion of that tender love which ſhe as the kindeſt of ſiſters, has a right to expect from you.</p>
               <p>Robin, Dicky, and Flapſy, were quite confounded at their mother's ſurprizing them in the midſt of their naughty behaviour, and Peckſy felt an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate concern that they had incurred the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſo tender a parent; and far from increaſing it by complaining of them, endeavoured to ſoften her anger.

<pb n="33" facs="unknown:027817_0032_0FD64DFCAF007880"/>
meant to try my affections.—To ſpare them the trouble of any future trial, I now entreat them to believe my aſſurances, that I would willingly reſign the greateſt pleaſure in life, could I by that means increaſe their happineſs; and ſo far from wiſhing for the <hi>niceſt morſel,</hi> I would content myſelf with the humbleſt fare, rather than any of them ſhould be diſappointed. This tender ſpeech had its deſired effect; it recalled thoſe ſentiments of love, which envy and jealouſy had for a time baniſhed; each neſtling acknowledged its fault, and having obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the forgiveneſs of their mother, a perfect recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation too place, to the great joy of Peckſy, and indeed of all parties.</p>
               <p>All the neſtlings continued very good for ſeveral days, and no occurrence happened worth relating: the little flock were ſoon covered with feathers, which their mother taught them to dreſs, telling them, that neatneſs was a very eſſential thing being conducive to health, and alſo to render them agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the eye of the world.</p>
               <p>Robin was a very ſtrong robuſt bird, not remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for his beauty, but there was a great briſkneſs in his manner, which covered many defects, and he was very likely to attract notice. His father judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the tone of his chirpings, that he would be a very good ſong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Dicky had a remarkable fine plumage, his breaſt was of a beautiful red, his body and wings of an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:027817_0033_0FD64DFEA59C1CE0"/>
mottled brown, and his eyes ſparkled like dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds.</p>
               <p>Flapſy was alſo very pretty, but more diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the elegance of her ſhape, than for the variety and luſture of her feathers.</p>
               <p>Peckſy had no outward charms to recommend her to notice; but theſe defects were amply ſupplyed by the ſweetneſs of her diſpoſition, which was ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the greateſt degree. Her temper was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſerene, ſhe was ever attentive to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her parents, and would not have grieved them for the world, and her affection for her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ſiſter was ſo great, that ſhe conſtantly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred their intereſt to her own, of which we lately gave an inſtance.</p>
               <p>The kind parents attended to them with unremit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting affection, and made their daily viſit to Maſter Miſs Benſon, who very punctually diſcharged the benevolent office of feeding them. The Robin Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaſts, familiarized by repeated favours, approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nearer and nearer to their little friends by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and at length ventured to enter the room and feed upon the breakfaſt-table. Miſs Harriet was delighted at this circumſtance, and Frederick was quite tranſported; he longed to catch the birds, but his mamma told him, that would be the very means to drive them away. Miſs Harriet entreated him not to frighten them on any account, and he was prevailed on to forbear; but could not help expreſſing a wiſh
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:027817_0034_0FD64DFFA7213640"/>
that he had them in a cage, that he might feed them all day long.</p>
               <p>And do you really think, Frederick, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, that theſe little delicate creatures are ſuch gluttons, as to deſire to be fed all day long? Could you tempt them to do it, they would ſoon die; but they know better, and as ſoon as their appetites are ſatisfied, always leave of eating. Many a little boy may learn a leſſon from them. Do not you recollect one of your acquaintance, who, if an apple-pie, or any thing elſe that he calls nice, is ſet before him, will eat till he makes himſelf ſick? Frederick look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſhamed, being conſcious that he was too much inclined to indulge his love of delicacies. Well, ſaid his mamma, I ſee you underſtand who I mean, Frederick, ſo we will ſay no more on that ſubject; only when you meet with that little Gentleman, give my love to him, and tell him I beg he will be as moderate as his Redbreaſts.</p>
               <p>The cock bird having finiſhed his breakfaſt, flew out at the window, followed by his mate; and as ſoon as they were out of ſight, Mrs. Benſon continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her diſcourſe. And would you really confine theſe ſweet creatures in a cage, Frederick, merely to have the pleaſure of looking at them? Should you like to be always ſhut up in a little room, and think it ſufficient if you were ſupplied with victuals and drink? Is there no enjoyment in running about, jumping, and going from place to place? Do not
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:027817_0035_0FD64E014E120918"/>
you like to aſſociate with little boys and girls? And is there no pleaſure in breathing the freſh air? Though theſe little animals are inferior to you, there is no doubt but they are capable of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſimilar to theſe; and it muſt be a dreadful life for a poor bird to be ſhut up in a cage, where he cannot ſo much as make uſe of his wings—where he is excluded from his natural companions—and where he cannot poſſibly receive that refreſhment, which the air muſt afford to him when at liberty to ſoar to ſuch a heigth. But this is not all, for many a poor bird is caught and ſeperated from its family, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it has been at the trouble of building a neſt—has perhaps laid its eggs—or even hatched its young ones, which are by this means expoſed to inevitable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. It is likely that theſe very Redbreaſts may have young ones, for this is the ſeaſon of the year for their hatching; and I rather think they have, from the circumſtance of their always coming toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If this is the caſe, ſaid Miſs Harriet, it would be a pitty indeed to confine them. But why, mamma if it wrong to catch birds, did you at one time keep Canaries,? The caſe is very different in reſpect to Canaries, my dear, ſaid Mrs. Benſon. By keeping them in a cage, I do them a kindneſs. I conſider them as little foreigners who claim my hoſpitality. This kind of bird came originally from a warm cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, they are in their nature very ſuſceptible of cold and would periſh in the open air in our win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:027817_0036_0FD64E029B1ABC68"/>
neither does the food which they feed on grew plentifully in this country; and as they are always here bred in cages, they do not know how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the materials for the neſts abroad. And there is another particular which would greatly diſtreſs them were they to be turned looſe, which is, the ridicule and contempt they would be expoſed to from other birds. I remember once to have ſeen a poor Canary, which had been turned looſe becauſe it could not ſing; and ſurely no creature could be more miſerable. It was ſtarving for want of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, famiſhing with thirſt, ſhivering with cold, and looked terrified to the greateſt degree; whilſt a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Sparrows and Chaffinches purſued it from place to place, twittering and chirping with every mark of inſolence and deriſion. I could not help fancying the little creature to be like a foreigner juſt landed from ſome diſtant country, followed by a rude rabble of boys, who were ridiculing him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his dreſs and language were ſtrange to them.</p>
               <p>And what became of the poor little creature, mamma? ſaid Miſs Harriet. I was going to tell you, my dear, replied Mrs. Benſon. I ordered the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to bring me a cage, with ſeed and water in their uſual places; this I cauſed to be hung on a tree, next to that in which the little ſufferer in vain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to hide himſelf among the leaves from his cruel purſuers. No ſooner did the ſervant retire,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:027817_0037_0FD64E066C56AD70"/>
than the poor little wretch flew to it. I immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had the cage brought into the parlour, where I experienced great pleaſure in obſerving what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs the poor creature enjoyed in her deliverance. I kept it ſome years, but not chuſing to confine her in a <hi>little</hi> cage, had a <hi>large</hi> one bought, and procured a companion for her of her own ſpecies. I ſupplied them with materials for building, and from them proceeded a little colony, which grew ſo numerous, that you know I gave them to Mr. F. to put in his aviary, where you have ſeen them enjoying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. So now I hope I have fully accounted for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept Canary birds in a cage. You have indeed, mamma, ſaid Harriet. I have alſo, ſaid Mrs. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, occaſionally kept Larks. In ſevere winters vaſt numbers of them come to this country from a colder climate, and many periſh. Quantities of them are killed and ſold for the ſpit, and the bird-catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers uſually have a great many to ſell, and many an idle boy has ſome to diſpoſe of. I frequently buy them, as you know, Harriet, but as ſoon as the fine weather returns, I conſtantly ſet them at liberty. But come, my dears, prepare for your morning walk, and afterwards let me ſee you in my dreſſing-room.</p>
               <p>I wonder, ſaid Frederick, whether our Redbreaſts have got a neſt? I will watch to-morrow which way they fly, for I ſhould like to ſee the little ones. And what will you do ſhould you find them out? ſaid his mamma. Not take the neſt, I hope? Why,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:027817_0038_0FD64E067118B5D8"/>
replied Frederick, I ſhould like to bring it home, mamma, and put it in a tree near the houſe, and then I would ſcatter crumbs for the old ones to feed them with. Your deſign is a kind one, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, but would greatly diſtreſs your little fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites. Many birds, through fear forſake their neſts, when they are removed, therefore I deſire you to let them alone if you ſhould chance to find them. Miſs Harriet then remarked, that ſhe thought it very cruel to take birds neſts. Ah! my dear, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, thoſe who commit ſuch barbarous actions, are quite inſenſible to the diſtreſſes they occaſion. It is very true, that we ought not to indulge ſo great a degree of pity and tenderneſs for ſuch animals, as for thoſe who are more properly our fellow-creatures; I mean men women and children; but as every liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creature can feel, we ſhould have a conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to thoſe feelings, and ſtrive to give happineſs, rather than inflict miſery. But go, my dear, and take your walk. Mrs. Benſon then left them, to attend her uſual morning employments; and the young Lady and Gentleman, attended by their maid, paſſed an agreeable half hour in the garden.</p>

               <p>IN the mean time, the hen Redbreaſt returned to the neſt, whilſt her mate took his flight in ſearch of food for his family When the mother approached the neſt, ſhe was ſurprized at not hearing as uſual the chirping of her young ones; and what was her aſtoniſhment at ſeeing them all crouded together, trembling with apprehenſion! What is the matter, my neſtlings, ſaid ſhe, that I find you in this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror? —Oh, my dear mother! ſaid Robin, who firſt ventured to raiſe up his head, is it you? Peckſy then revived, and entreated her mother to come into the neſt, which ſhe did without delay, and the little tremblers crept under her wings, endeavouring to conceal themſelves in this happy retreat. What has terrified you in his manner? ſaid ſhe. Oh! I do not know, replied Dicky, but we have ſeen ſuch a monſter as I never beheld before. A monſter, my dear? pray deſcribe it. I cannot, ſaid Dicky, it was too frightful to be deſcribed. Frightful, indeed, cried Robin, but I had a full view of it, and will give the beſt deſcription I can. We were all lying peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the neſt, and very happy together; I and Dicky were trying to ſing, when ſuddenly we heard a noiſe againſt the wall, and preſently a great round red face appeared before the neſt, with a pair of enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:027817_0040_0FD64E0CB45333E0"/>
ſtaring eyes, a very large beak, and below that a wide mouth, with two rows of bones, that looked as if they could grind us all to pieces in an inſtant. About the top of this round face, and down the ſides, hung ſomething black, but not like fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. When the two ſtaring eyes had looked at us for ſome time, the whole thing diſappeared. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at all conceive, from your deſcription, Robin, what this thing could be, ſaid the mother, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may come again. Oh! I hope not, cried Flapſy, I ſhall die with fear if it does. Why ſo, my love? ſaid her mother, has it done you any harm? I cannot ſay it has, replied Flapſy. Well then, you do very wrong, my dear, in giving way to ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. You muſt ſtrive to get the better of that fearful diſpoſition. When you go abroad in the world, you will ſee many ſtrange objects; and if you are terrified at every appearance which you cannot account for, you will live a moſt unhappy life. Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be good, and then you need not fear anything. But here comes your father, perhaps he will explain the appearance which has ſo alarmed you to-day. As ſoon as the father had given the worm to Robin, he was preparing to depart for another, but to his ſurprize, all the reſt of the neſtlings begged him to ſtay, declaring that they had rather go without their meal, on condition he would but remain at
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:027817_0041_0FD64E10E2DC5100"/>
home and take care of them. Stay at home and take care of you! ſaid he. Why is that more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary now than uſual? The mother then related the ſtrange occurrence that had occaſioned this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. Nonſenſe, ſaid he—a monſter!—large mouth! —long beak!—I don't underſtand ſuch ſtuff.— Beſides, as it did them no harm, why are they to be in ſuch terror now it is gone? Don't be angry, dear father, ſaid Peckſy, for it was very frightful indeed. Well, ſaid he, I will fly all round the orchard, and perhaps may meet this monſter. Oh! it will eat you up! it will eat you up! ſaid Flapſy. Never fear, ſaid he, and away he flew. The mother then again attempted to calm them, but all in vain, their fears were now redoubled by apprehenſions for their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſafety; however, he ſoon returned. Well, ſaid he, I have ſeen this monſter; the little ones then clung to their mother, fearing the dreadful creature was juſt at hand. What, afraid again! cried he; a parcel of ſtout hearts I have in my neſt truly! Why, when you fly about in the world you will, in all probability, ſee hundreds of ſuch monſters, (as you call them) unleſs you chuſe to confine your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a retired life; nay, even in woods and groves you will be liable to meet ſome of them, and thoſe of the moſt miſchievous kind. I begin to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſaid the mother, that theſe dear neſtlings have ſeen the face of a man. Even ſo, replied her

And does he live in this garden? ſaid Flapſy. He works here very often, replied her father, but is frequently abſent. O then, cried ſhe, pray take us abroad when he is away, for indeed I cannot bear to ſee him. You are a little ſimpleton, ſaid the father; and if you do not endeavour to get more reſolution, I will leave you in the neſt by yourſelf, when I am teaching your brothers and ſiſters to fly and peck, and what will you do then? for you muſt not expect we will go from them to bring you food. Flapſy, fearful that her father would be quite an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, promiſed to follow his directions in every reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and the reſt animated by his diſcourſe, began to recover their ſpirits.</p>

Both the young gentleman and lady, who were accuſtomed to receive little civilities from Joe, very readily attended him, thinking he had got ſome fruit or flowers for them. Well, Joe, ſaid Miſs Benſon, what have you to ſay to us? Have you got a peach or a nectarine? Or have you brought me a root of Sweet William? No, Miſs Harriet, ſaid Joe, but I have ſomething to tell you, that will pleaſe you as much as though I had. What's that? What's that? cried Frederick. Why maſter Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, ſaid Joe, a pair of Robins have <hi>com'd</hi> mortal often to one place in the orchard lately; ſo, thinks I, theſe birds have got a neſt. So, I watches and watc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es, and at laſt I <hi>ſee'd</hi> the old hen fly into a hole in the ivy-wall. I had a fancy to ſet my ladder and look in, but as maſter ordered me not to fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the birds, I ſtaid till the old one flew out again, and then I mounted, and there I <hi>ſee'd</hi> the little crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures full fledged; and if you and Miſs Harriet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

but a little way from the ground, and you may eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily get up the ſtep-ladder. Frederick was in rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, being confident that theſe were the identical Robins that he was ſo attached to, and (like a little thoughtleſs boy as he was) would have gone im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately with the gardener, had not his ſiſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded him, that it was proper to aſk mamma's leave firſt, for which purpoſe ſhe accompanied him into the parlour. Good news! Good news! mamma, cried Frederick, Joe has found the Robins neſt. Has he indeed? ſaid Mrs. Benſon. Yes, mamma, ſaid Miſs Harrit, and if agreeable to you, we ſhould be glad to go along with Joe to ſee it. And how are you to get at it, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, for I ſuppoſe it is ſome height from the ground? Oh! I can climb a ladder very well, cried Frederick. You climb a lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der! You are a clever gentleman at climbing I know, replied his mamma: but do you propoſe to mount too, Harriet? I think this rather an indelicate ſcheme for a lady. Joe tells me that the neſt is a very little way from the ground, mamma, anſwered Harriet, but if I find it otherwiſe, you may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:027817_0045_0FD64E17A5D08AC0"/>When the Redbreaſts had quieted the fears of their young family, they fed them as uſual, and then, having a little private buſineſs, they retired to a tree, deſiring their neſtlings not to be terrified if the monſter ſhould look in upon them again, as it was very probably he would do. They promiſed to bear the ſight as well as they could.</p>
               <p>When the old ones were ſeated in the tree, it is time, ſaid the father, to take our neſtlings abroad. You ſee, my love, how very timorous they are, and if we do not uſe them a little to the world they will never be able to ſhift for themſelves. Very true, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the mother, they are now full fledged, and therefore if you pleaſe, we will take them out to morrow: but it will be neceſſary for me to prepare them for it, I will therefore return to the neſt. One of the beſt preparitives, anſwered her mate, will be to leave them by themſelves a little; therefore we will now take a flight together for a ſhort time, and then go back. The mother then complied, but not without reluctance, for ſhe longed to be with her de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>AS ſoon as Joe found that the young <hi>gentry,</hi> as he called them, had obtained permiſſion to accompany him, he took Frederick by the hand, and ſaid, come along, my young maſter, but at miſs Harriet's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, ſtopped whilſt ſhe fetched her bonnet and tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. Frederick's impatience was ſo great, that he could ſcarcely be reſtrained from running all the way, but that his ſiſter intreated him not to make himſelf too hot. At length they arrived at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſpot; Joe placed the ladder, and his young maſter, with a little aſſiſtance, mounted it very dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly: But who can deſcribe his raptures when he beheld the neſtlings! Oh! the ſweet creatures, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, there are four of them, I declare! I never ſaw any thing ſo pretty in my life! I wiſh I might carry you all home! That you muſt not do, Frederick, ſaid his ſiſter; and I beg you will come away, for you will either terrify the little creatures, or alarm the old birds, which perhaps are now waiting ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I hope you will come ſoon, along with your father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be fed in the parlour. He then, under the conduct of his friend Joe, deſcended.

he, will you go up? As the ſteps of the ladder were broad, and the neſt was not high, Miſs Benſon ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to go up, and was equally delighted with her brother; but ſo fearful of terrifying the little birds, and alarming the old ones, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſhe would only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge herſelf with a peep at the neſt. Frederick enquired how ſhe liked the young Robins? They are ſweet creatures, ſaid ſhe, and I hope we ſhall ſoon find means to invite them to join our party of birds, for they appear to me ready to fly; but let us return to mamma, for you know we promiſed her to ſtay but a little while; beſides we hinder Joe from his work. Never mind that ſaid the honeſt fellow, maſter wont be angry, I am <hi>ſartain;</hi> and if I thought he would, I would work an hour later to fetch up loſt time. Thank you, Joe, replied Miſs Harriet, but I am ſure papa would not deſire that. At this inſtant Frederick perceived the two Redbreaſts, who were returning from their propoſed excurſion, and called to his ſiſter to obſerve them.

her habitation, ſuppoſed, from their being ſo near, that they had been taking a view of it, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated her ſuſpicions to her mate. He agreed with her that this had probably been the caſe, and ſaid he now expected to hear a fine ſtory from the neſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. Let us return, however, ſaid the mother, for perhaps they have been terrified again. Well ſaid he, I will attend you then; but let me caution, you, my dear, not to indulge their fearful diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe ſuch indulgence will certainly prove injurious to them. I will do the beſt I can, replied he, and then flew to the neſt, followed by her mate. She alighted upon the ivy, and peeping into the neſt, enquired how they all did? Very well, dear mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaid Robin. What, cried the father, (who now alighted) all ſafe? Not one eat up by the monſter? No, father, replied Dicky, we are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, and yet, I aſſure you, the monſter we ſaw yeſterday has been here again, and brought two others with him. Two others! what, like himſelf? ſaid the father: I thought, Flapſy, you were to die with apprehenſion if you ſaw him again? And ſo I believe I ſhould have done, had not you, my good father, inſtructed me to conquer my fears, Flapſy. When I ſaw the top of him, my heart began to flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſuch a degree, that I was ready to faint, and every feather of me ſhook; but when I found that he ſtaid but a very little while, I recovered and was
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:027817_0049_0FD64E1CDDA2F1D0"/>
in hopes he was quite gone. My brothers and ſiſter, I believe, felt as I did; but we comforted one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the danger was over for this day, and all agreed to make ourſelves happy, and not fear this monſter, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> you had aſſured us he was very harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. However, before we were perfectly come to ourſelves, we heard very uncommon noiſes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a hoarſe ſound, diſagreeable to our cars as the croaking of a raven, and ſometimes a ſhriller noiſe, quite unlike the note of any bird that we know of, and immediately after ſomething preſented itſelf to our view, which bore a reſemblance to the monſter, but not ſo frightful. Inſtead of being all over red, it had on each ſide two ſpots of a more beautiful hue than Dicky's breaſt, the reſt of it was of a moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate white, excepting two ſtreaks of a deep red, like the cherry you brought us the other day, and between theſe two ſtreaks we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There was ſo chearful and pleaſing a look in this creature altogether, that notwithſtanding I own I was rather afraid, yet I had pleaſure in looking at it, but it ſtaid a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time and then diſappeared. Whilſt we were puzzling ourſelves with conjectures concerning it,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:027817_0050_0FD64E1E93589F18"/>
another creature, larger than it appeared before us, equally beautiful, and with an aſpect ſo mild and gentle, that we were all charmed with it; but, as if fearful of alarming us by its ſtay, it immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, and we have been longing for your and my mother's return, in hopes you would be able to tell us what we have ſeen.</p>
               <p>I am happy, my dears, ſaid the mother, to find you more compoſed than I expected; for as your father and I were flying together in order to come back to you, we obſerved the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and the two pretty creatures Peckſy has deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; the former is, as your father before informed you, our friend the gardener, and the others are our young benefactors, by whoſe bounty we are every day regaled, and who, I will venture to ſay, will do you no harm. You cannot think how kindly they treat us; and though there are a number of other birds who ſhare their goodneſs, your father and I are ſavoured with their particular regard. Oh, ſaid Peckſy, are theſe ſweet creatures your friends? I long to go abroad that I may ſee them again. Well, cried Flapſy, I perceive that if we judge from appearances we may often be miſtaken; who would have thought that ſuch an ugly monſter as that gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener, could have had a tender heart? Very true, replied the mother; you muſt make it a rule, Flapſy, to judge of <hi>mankind</hi> by their <hi>actions,</hi> and not by their <hi>looks.</hi> I have known ſome of them, whoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:027817_0051_0FD64E21DB5D8DE0"/>
was as engaging as that of our young be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors, who were, notwithſtanding, barbarous enough to take eggs out of a neſt and ſpoil them; nay even carry away neſt and all before the young ones were fledged, without knowing how to feed them, or having any regard to the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of the tender parents. Yes, ſaid the mother, laſt year it was my misfortune to be deprived of my neſtlings in that manner, which occaſions my being ſo timid; the anguiſh I ſuffered for their loſs is not to be expreſſed.</p>
               <p>A calamity of the ſame kind befel me, replied the father, I never ſhall forget it. I had been making an excurſion into the woods, in order to procure ſome delicious morfels for one of my neſtlings; when I returned to the place in which I had imprudently built, (for being young and inexperienced, I did not foreſee the danger of chuſing an expoſed ſituation,) the firſt circumſtance that alarmed me, was a part of my neſt ſcattered upon the ground, juſt at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of my habitation; I then perceived a large opening in the wall, where before there was only room for myſelf to paſs. I ſtopped with a palpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting heart, in hopes of hearing the chirpings of my beloved family; but all was ſilence. I then reſolved to enter; but what was my conſternation, when I found that the neſt, which my dear mate and I had with ſo much labour built, and the dear little ones, who were the joy of our lives, were taken
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:027817_0052_0FD64E23A1D03830"/>
away; nay, I did not know but that the tender mother alſo was taken captive. I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ruſhed out of the place, diſtracted with appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the miſeries they might endure; lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my weakneſs, which rendered me incapable of effecting their reſcue; was ready to tear off my own feathers with vexation; but recollecting that my dear mate might in all probability have eſcaped, I reſolved to go in ſearch of her. As I was flying along, I ſaw three boys whoſe appearance was far from diſagreeable; one of whom held in his hand my neſt of young ones, which he eyed with cruel exultation, whilſt his companions ſeemed to ſhare his joy.</p>
               <p>My dear little creatures, inſenſible of their fate, (for they were newly hatched) opened their mouths in expectation of the uſual ſupply, but all in vain, to have attempted feeding them at this time would have been inevitable deſtruction to myſelf; but I reſolved to follow the barbarians, that I might at leaſt ſee to what place my darlings were conſigned. In a ſhort time the party arrived at a houſe, and he who before held the neſt, now committed it to the care of another, but ſoon returned with a kind of victuals I was totally unacquainted with; and with this my young, when they gaped for food, were fed: hunger induced them to ſwallow it with avidity,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:027817_0053_0FD64E251F2C3598"/>
but ſoon after miſſing the warmth of their mother they ſet up a general chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p of lamentation which pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced my very heart. Immediately after this the neſt was carried away, and what became of my neſtlings afterwards I never could diſcover, though I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently hovered about the fatal ſpot of their impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, with the hope of ſeeing them.</p>
               <p>Pray, father, ſaid Dicky, what became of your mate? Why, my dear, ſaid he, when I found there was no chance of aſſiſting my little ones, I purſued my courſe, and ſought her in every place of our uſual reſort, but to no purpoſe: At length I returned to the buſh, where I beheld an afflicting ſight indeed, my dear companion lying on the ground, juſt expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! I flew to her inſtantly, and endeavoured to recal her to life: at the ſound of my voice, ſhe lifted up her languid eye-lids and with feeble accents ſaid, And are you then ſafe, my love? What is become of our little ones? In hopes of comforting her, I told her they were alive and well; but ſhe replied, your conſolations come too late; the blow is ſtruck, I feel death approaching. The horror which ſeized me when I miſſed my neſtlings, and ſuppoſed myſelf robbed at once of my mate and infants, was too pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful for my weak frame to ſuſtain. Oh! why will the human race be ſo want only cruel! The agonies of death now came on, and after a few convulſive pangs, ſhe breathed her laſt, and left me an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py widower. I paſſed the remainder of the ſummer,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:027817_0054_0FD64E28A8455F38"/>
and a dreary winter that ſucceeded it, in a very uncomfortable manner; though the natural cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my diſpoſition, did not leave me long a prey to unavailing ſorrow: and having paid a proper tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the memory of my firſt dear mate, I reſolved the following ſpring to ſeek another; and had the good fortune to meet with one, whoſe amiable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition has renewed my former happineſs: and now, my dear ſaid he, let me aſk you what became of your former companion? Why, replied the hen Redbreaſt, ſoon after the loſs of our neſt, as he was endeavouring to diſcover what was become of it, a cruel hawk caught him up, and devoured him in an inſtant.</p>
               <p>I need not ſay that I felt the bittereſt pangs for his loſs; it is ſufficient to inform you that I led a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary life, till I met with you, whoſe endearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour has made ſociety again agreeable to me.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the parent birds were thus relating the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of their paſt misfortunes, the young ones liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the greateſt attention; and when the tales were ended, Flapſy exclaimed, Oh! what dangers there are in the world! I ſhall be afraid to leave the neſt. Why ſo, my love? ſaid the mother. Every bird does not meet with Hawks and cruel children. You have already, as you ſat on the neſt, ſeen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of the feathered race, of one kind or other, making their airy excurſions, full of mirth and gaie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This orchard conſtantly reſounds with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:027817_0055_0FD64E2EF5D65940"/>
of thoſe who chaunt forth their ſongs of joy, and I believe there are no beings in the world hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than birds, for we are naturally formed for cheerfulneſs; and I flatter myſelf, a prudent precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will preſerve both your father and myſelf from any future accident. Our parents were young and unexperienced themſelves, and did not give us good advice; but we know the dangers of the world, and I hope ſhall be able to point out to you ſuch rules of conduct as may, if followed, counteract the uſual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents to which birds are expoſed. Inſtead of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging your fears, Flapſy, ſaid the father, ſummon up all your courage, for to-morrow you ſhall, with your brothers and ſiſter, begin to ſee the world. Dicky expreſſed great delight at this declaration, and Robin boaſted that he had not the leaſt remains of fear. Flapſy, though ſtill apprehenſive of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, yet longed to ſee the gaieties of life, and Peck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy wiſhed to comply with every deſire of her dear parents. The approach of evening now reminded them that it was time to take repoſe, and turning their heads under their wings, each bird ſoon reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itſelf to the gentle power of ſleep.</p>

               <p>AFTER Maſter and Miſs Benſon had been grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the ſight of the Robin's neſt, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the houſe, conducted by their friend Joe, when they were met in the garden by their papa and mamma, accompanied by Miſs Lucy Jenkins and her brother Edward. The former was a fine girl about ten years old, the latter a robuſt rude boy, turned of eleven. We were coming to ſeek you, my dears, ſaid Mrs. Benſon to her children, for I was fearful that the buſineſs you went upon would make you forget your young viſitors. I cannot anſwer for Frederick, replied Miſs Benſon, but indeed, my dear mamma, I would not on any account have ſlighted my friends. How do you do, my dear miſs Jenkins? ſaid ſhe, I am happy to ſee you. Will you go with me into the play-room? I have got ſome very pretty new books. Frederick, have you nothing to ſhew Maſter Jenkins? O yes, ſaid Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick, I have got a new ball, a new top, a new organ, and twenty pretty things; but I had rather go back and ſhew him the Robins. The Robins! ſaid Maſter Jenkins, what Robins? Why our Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, that have built in the ivy-wall. You never ſaw any thing ſo pretty in your life as the little ones. Oh, I can ſee birds enow at home, ſaid Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Jenkins; but why did you not take the neſt? It

would have been nice diverſion to you to toſs the young birds about. I have had a great many neſts this year, and do believe I have an hundred eggs. An hundred eggs! and how do you purpoſe to hatch them? ſaid Miſs Harriet, who turned back on hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him talk in this manner. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tch them Miſs Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? ſaid he; who ever thinks of hatching birds eggs? Oh, then you eat them, ſaid Frederick, or perhaps let your cook make puddings of them? No, indeed, replied Maſter Jenkins, I blow out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and then run a thread through them, and give them to Lucy to hang up amongſt her curioſities, and very pretty they look, I aſſure you. And ſo, ſaid Miſs Harriet, you had rather ſee a parcel of empty egg-ſhells, than hear a ſweet concert of birds ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the trees? I admire your taſte truly! Why, is there any harm in taking birds eggs? ſaid Miſs Jenkins; I never before heard there was. My dear mamma, replied Miſs Benſon, has taught me to think, there is harm in every action which gives cauſeleſs pain to any living creature; and I own I have a very particular affection for birds. Well, ſaid Miſs Jenkins, I have no notion of ſuch affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for my part. Sometimes, indeed I try to rear thoſe which Edward brings home, but they are teazing troubleſome things, and I am not lucky; to tell the truth I do not concern myſelf much about them; if they <hi>live</hi> they <hi>live,</hi> and if they <hi>die</hi> they <hi>die.</hi> He has brought me three neſts this day to plague

I did not think of them, but will feed them when I return, ſaid Miſs Jenkins. Oh, cried Miſs Benſon, I cannot bear the thoughts of what the poor little creatures muſt ſuffer. Well, ſaid Maſter Jenkins, ſince you feel ſo much for them, I think, Miſs Harriet, you will make the beſt nurſe. What ſay you, Lucy, will you give the neſts to Miſs Benſon? With all my heart, replied his ſiſter, and pray do not plague me with any more of them. I do not know that my mamma will let me accept them, ſaid Miſs Benſon, but if ſhe will, I ſhall be glad to do ſo. Frederick enquired what birds they were, and Maſter Jenkins informed him, there was a neſt of Linnets, a neſt of Sparrows, and another of Blackbirds. Frederick was all impatience to ſee them, and Miſs Harriet longed to have the little creatures in her poſſeſſion, that ſhe might reſcue them from their deplorable condition, and leſſen the evils of captivity, which they now ſuffered in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme. Her mamma had left her with her young company, that they might indulge themſelves in innocent amuſements without reſtraint, but the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted Harriet could not engage in any diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

This admonition from Mrs. Benſon, which Miſs Jenkins did not expect made her look very ſerious, and brought tears into her eyes; on which the good Lady took her by the hand and kindly ſaid, I wiſh not to diſtreſs you, my dear, but merely to awaken the natural ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your heart: Reflect at your leiſure on what I have taken the liberty of ſaying to you, and I am ſure you will think me your friend.

But let me not detain you from your amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; go to your own apartments, Harriet, and uſe your beſt endeavours to make your viſitors hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.

                  </gap>or you to take ſo long a walk, as you muſt come back afterwards; and I make no doubt but that to oblige you, ſhe will feed them to-night. Miſs Harriet and Miſs Jenkins returned, and found Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick diverting himſelf with a hand organ, which had lately been preſented by his good-papa; but maſter Jenkins had laid hold of Miſs Harriet's dog, and was ſearching his own pocked for a piece of ſtring, that he might tie him and the cat together, to ſee, as he ſaid, how nicely they would fight: and ſo fully was he bent on this cruel purpoſe, that it was with difficulty he could be prevailed on to relinquiſh it. Dear me, ſaid he, if ever I came into ſuch a houſe in my life, there is no <hi>fun</hi> here. What would you have ſaid to Harry Pritchard and me, the other day, when we made the cats fly? Made cats fly! ſaid Frederick, how was that? Why, replied he, we tied bladders to each ſide of their necks, and then flung them from the top of the houſe. There was an end of their purring and mewing for ſome time, I aſſure you, for they lay a long while ſtruggling and gaſping for breath; and if they had not had nine lives, I think they muſt
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:027817_0062_0FD64E3BA1E936A0"/>
have died; but at laſt up they jumped, and away ran ſcampering. Then out came little Jemmy, crying as if he had flown down himſelf becauſe we hurt the poor cats; he had a dog running after him, who I ſuppoſe, meant to call us to taſk, with his <hi>bow, wow;</hi> but we ſoon ſtopped his tongue, for we caught the gentleman and drove him before us into a narrow lane, and then ran hooting after him into the village; a number of boys joined us, and cried out as we did, <hi>a mad dog! a mad dog!</hi> On this ſeveral people purſued him with cudgels and broomſticks, and at laſt he was ſhot by a man, but not dead, ſo others came and knocked him about the head till he expired. For ſhame! Maſter Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, ſaid Miſs Harriet, how can you talk in that rhodomontade manner? I cannot believe any young gentleman could bring his heart to ſuch barbarities. Barbarities, indeed! why have we not a <hi>right</hi> to do as we pleaſe to dogs and cats, or do you think they <hi>feel</hi> as we do? Fiddle faddle of your nonſenſe, ſay I; come, you muſt hear the end of my ſtory. When the dog was dead, we carried him home to little Jemmy, who was ready to break his heart for the loſs of him; ſo we did not like to ſtand hearing his whining, therefore we left him and got a Cock, whoſe legs were tied, and flung at him till he died. Then we ſet two others to fig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After this we picked all the feathers off a live chicken, and you never ſaw ſuch a ridiculous little animal in your life. Then we got ſome puppies, and drowned them whilſt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>itch ſtood by. Oh! how ſhe howled and cried, whilſt they ſtruggled on the ſurface of the water; and there was no quieting her for ſeveral days. Stop! Stop! ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Miſs Harriet; for pity's ſake, ſtop! I can hear no more of your horrid narrations; nor would I commit even <hi>one</hi> of thoſe barbarities which you boaſt of for the world! Poor innocent creatures! what had they done to you to deſerve ſuch uſage? I beg Edward, ſaid his ſiſter, that you will find ſome other way to entertain us, or I ſhall really tell Mrs. Benſon of you. What! are you growing tenderhearted all at once! cried he. I will tell you what I think when I go home, replied Miſs Jenkins. As for poor Frederick, he was drowned in tears; and Harriet's flowed in a copious ſtream, with the bare idea of the ſufferings of the poor animals, particularly of the live chicken, and the poor bitch, whoſe puppies were drowned in her ſight: but Edward was ſo accuſtomed to be guilty of thoſe things without reflection, that there was no making any impreſſion of tenderneſs upon his mind; and he only laughed at their concern, and wanted to tell a long ſtory about an ox that had
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:027817_0064_0FD64E3ED0EA94E8"/>
been driven by a cruel drover till he went mad: but Miſs Benſon and his ſiſter ſtopped their ears. As ſoon as they left off doing ſo, he began another about Bat-fowling; which is a treacherous cuſtom of going with a lantern by night to the hedges. where birds rooſt, and frightening them into a net placed for the purpoſe. In ſhort, it appeared from his diſcourſe, that he was acquainted with the whole art of tormenting animals. At laſt little Frederick went crying to his mamma, and the young ladies retired to another apartment, ſo Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Jenkins amuſed himſelf with catching flies in the window, pulling the legs off from ſome and the wings from others, delighted with their extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which were occaſioned by the agonies they endured. Mrs. Benſon had ſome viſitors, which prevented her talking of this cruel boy, as ſhe otherwiſe would have done, on hearing Frederick's account of him, but ſhe determined to tell his papa; which ſhe accordingly did ſome time after, when he returned home: but this gentleman, ſo far from reproving his ſon, applauded him as a lad of life and ſpirit, and ſaid he would be fit to go through the world.</p>
               <p>Maſter Jenkins was now diſturbed from his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous ſport by being called to tea; and ſoon after that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

his ſiſter. Miſs Harriet earneſtly entreated her friend Lucy to feed the birds properly, till ſhe ſhould be allowed to fetch them, who promiſed to do ſo; for ſhe was greatly affected with Mrs. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's diſcourſe, and then entreated her brother to take leave, that ſhe might return home; with this he readily complied, as there were no further op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities for cruelty.</p>

               <p>AFTER her little viſitors were departed, Miſs Harriet went into the drawing-room, and having paid her compliments, ſat herſelf down, that ſhe might improve her mind with the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the company.

However, do not ſuffer your mind to dwell on them, as the creatures on which he inflicted them are no longer objects of pity. It is wrong to grieve for the death of animal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> we do for the loſs of our friends, becauſe they certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:027817_0066_0FD64E471DC0B300"/>
are not of ſo much conſequence to our happineſs; and we are taught to think their ſufferings end with their lives, as they are not religious beings; and therefore the killing them even in the crueleſt manner, is not like murdering a human creature, who is perhaps unprepared to give an account of himſelf at the tribunal of heaven. I have, ſaid a Lady who was preſent, been for a long time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to conſider animals as mere machines ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by the unerring hand of Providence, to do thoſe things which are neceſſary for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of themſelves and their offspring; but the ſight of the learned Pig, which has lately been ſhewn in London, has deranged theſe ideas, and I know not what to think.</p>
               <p>If we puzzle our minds for ever, Madam, on the ſubject, replied a Gentleman, we ſhall never be able fully to comprehend the capacities and feelings of creatures ſo different from ourſelves. That they have not reaſonable ſouls, like the human race, is evident: but at the ſame time I think we may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover, that they have ſome proportion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, which is even capable of improvment to a certain degree: this is particularly exemplified in the inſtance which Mrs. Franks has juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned of the learned Pig. Mere inſtinct, I think, would never lead that creature to diſtinguiſh one letter from another, or, which amount<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <pb n="68" facs="unknown:027817_0067_0FD64E4865869528"/>
to the ſame thing, to comprehend the various ſigns by which they are pointed out to him by his keeper. To what a pitch may Dogs and Horſes be improved; nay, every kind of animal that I have had an opportunity of obſerving, ſeems to acquire ſagacity, by a familiar intercourſe with rational creatures, yet, after all, they fall ſhort of human reaſon beyond compariſon.</p>
               <p>For my part, replied Mrs. Benſon, I find the ſubject ſo much above my comprehenſion, that whenever my mind is diſpoſed to expatiate on it, I check the inclination, from an opinion that it is of no conſequence to me, whether animals have intellects or not, and that it is amongſt thoſe things which the Almighty has intentionally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from our penetration. That they are in the power of man, and ſubſervient to his uſe and pleaſure, gives them a ſufficient claim to our compaſſion and kindneſs; and whilſt I am partly fed and clothed at the expence of the animal creation, I could not bring myſelf to inflict wanton cruelties upon them. On the other hand, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has placed them ſo much beneath us in the ſcale of beings, I ſhould think it equally wrong to elevate them from their proper rank in life, and ſuffer them to occupy that ſhare of attention and love, which is due to our own ſpecies only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>You are certainly right, Madam, anſwered the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:027817_0068_0FD64E49F0B3D5A0"/>
Gentleman; there are objects enough for the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of human reaſon, without our endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to penetrate into thoſe things which muſt for ever remain hidden, unleſs the inferior creatures were endued with ſpeech. We can form but very imperfect ideas even of our own intellectual powers, ſtill leſs of thoſe of other men; and the further any creature is removed from us, the leſs capable are we of comprehending their natures, as we can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge, in theſe matters, by what paſſes in our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Neither you, Sir, nor Mrs. Benſon, ſaid Mrs. Franks, mean, I apprehend, to diſcourage the ſtudy of the natural hiſtory of animals. By no means, replied the latter; for as far as it is open to our view, it is replete with amuſement and inſtruction. It leads the mind to contemplate the perfections of the Supreme Being, and alſo furniſhes a variety of uſeful hints for the conduct of human affairs. Many important arts have, in all probability, been derived from them; and the exact regularity with which they diſcharge the offices of tenderneſs and oeconomy, afford examples of real utility to thoſe amongſt us, who are diſpoſed to neglect the duties of humanity. An idle perſon, for inſtance, may be admoniſhed by an Ant or Bee, a thoughtleſs mother by a Hen, an unfaithful ſervant by a Dog, and ſo on, as one of our Poets has elegantly pointed out

               <p>Then you would have condemned a Lady of my acquaintance ſaid the Gentleman, who has a little Lap-dog on which her happineſs totally depends, and to uſe a vulgar expreſſion, her very life ſeems to be wrapt up in his I am ſure it is quite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking to ſee a reaſonable creature make herſelf ſo ridiculous. It is more than ridiculous, replied Mrs. Benſon; it is really ſinful. At this inſtant the arrival of Mrs. Franks's coach was announced, and ſhe with the Gentlemen took leave.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they were gone, pray mamma, ſaid Harriet, what does the learned Pig do? I had a great deſire to aſk Mrs. Franks, but was fearful ſhe would think me impertinent. I commend your modeſty my dear, replied Mrs. Benſon, but would not have lead you into ſuch a degree of reſtraint, as to prevent your gratifying that laudable curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without which young perſons muſt remain ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norent of many things very proper for them to be acquainted with. Mrs. Franks would, I am ſure, have been far from thinking you impertinent: Thoſe enquiries only are thought troubleſome, by which children interrupt converſation, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to attract attention to their own inſignificant
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:027817_0070_0FD64E51E59F35D8"/>
prattle; but all people of good ſenſe and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture delight in giving them uſeful information. In reſpect to the learned Pig, I have heard things which are quite aſtoniſhing in a ſpecies of animals generally regarded as very ſtupid. The creature was ſhewn for a ſight in a room provided for the purpoſe, where a number of people aſſembled to view his performances. Two alphabets of large letters on card paper were placed on the floor: one of the company was then deſired to propoſe a word which he wiſhed the Pig to ſpell. This his keeper repeated to him, and the Pig picked out every letter ſucceſſively with his ſnout, and collected them together till the word was compleated. He was then deſired to tell the hour of the day, and one of the company held a watch to him, which he ſeemed with his little cunning eyes to examine very attentively; and having done ſo, picked out figures for the hour and minutes of the day. He ſhewed a number of tricks of the ſame nature, to the great diverſion of the ſpectator<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. For my own part, though I was in London at the time he was exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and heard continually of this wonderful Pig from perſons of my acquaintance, I never went to ſee him; for I am fully perſuaded, that great cruelty muſt have been exerciſed in teaching him things ſo foreign to his nature, and therefore would not give any encouragement to ſuch a ſcheme.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:027817_0071_0FD64E53D302AF18"/>And do you think, mamma, ſaid Harriet, that the Pig knows the letters, and can really ſpell words? I think it poſſible, my dear, for the Pig to be taught to know the letters one from the other, and that his keeper has ſome private ſign, by which he directs him to each that are wanted;—but that he has an idea of <hi>ſpelling,</hi> I can never believe, nor are animals capable of attaining human ſciences, becauſe, for theſe, human faculties are requiſite; and no art of man can <hi>change</hi> the nature of any thing, though we may be able to improve that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to a certain degree, or at leaſt to call forth to view, powers which would be hidden from us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would only be exerted in the intercourſe of animals with each other. As far as this can be done by familiarizing them, and ſhewing them ſuch a degree of kindneſs as is conſiſtent with our higher obligations, it may be an agreeable amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but will never anſwer any important pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to mankind; and I would adviſe you, Harriet, never to give countenance to thoſe people who ſhew what they call <hi>learned</hi> animals; as you may aſſure yourſelf they exerciſe great barbarities upon them, of which ſtarving them almoſt to death is moſt likely among the number.

               <p>The father was upon the wing betimes, that he might give each of his young ones a breakfaſt before they attempted to leave the neſt. When he had fed them, he deſired his mate to accompany him as uſual to Mrs. Benſon's, where he found the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour window open, and his young friends at break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt with their papa and mamma. Crumbs had been, according to cuſtom, ſtrewed before the window, which the other birds had almoſt entirely devoured; but the Redbreaſts took their uſual poſt on the tea-table, and the cock bird ſung his morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lay; after which they returned with all poſible ſpeed to the neſt, for having ſo important an affair to manage, they could not be long abſent. Neither could their young benefactors pay ſo much atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them as uſual, for they were impatient to
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:027817_0073_0FD64E56C94C4F60"/>
fetch the birds neſts from Miſs Jenkin's; therefore, as ſoon as breakfaſt was ended, they ſet out on their expedition. Harriet carried a baſket large enough to hold two neſts, and Frederick a ſmaller one for the other; thus equipped, with a ſervant attending them, they ſet off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jenkins's houſe was about a mile from Mr. Benſon's, it was delightfully ſituated; there was a beaut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ful lawn and canal before it, and a charming garden behind; on one ſide were corn fields, and on the other a wood. In ſuch a delightful retreat as this, it was natural to expect to find a great many birds; but, to Miſs Harriet's ſurprize they only ſaw a few ſtraggling ones here and there, who fled with the utmoſt precipitation as ſoon as ſhe and her brother appeared; on which ſhe obſerved to Frederick, that ſhe ſuppoſed Maſter Jenkin's practice of taking birds neſts had made them ſo ſhy, and entreated him never to commit ſo barbarous an action. She ſaid a great deal to him about the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties that naughty boy had boaſted of the evening before, which Frederick promiſed to remember.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they arrived at the houſe, Miſs Jenk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins ran out to receive them, but her brother was gone to ſchool. We are come, my dear Lucy, ſaid Miſs Benſon, to claim the performance of Maſter Jenkin's promiſe; how are your little priſoners?
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:027817_0074_0FD64E5CB3EEF3D0"/>
O! I know not what to ſay to you, my dear, ſaid Miſs Jenkins, I have very bad news to tell you, and I fear you will blame me exceedingly, though not more than I blame myſelf. I heartily wiſh I had returned home immediately after the kind lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture your mamma favoured me with yeſterday, which ſhewed me the cruelty of my behaviour, though I was then aſhamed to own my conviction. I walked as faſt as I could all the way from your houſe, and determined to give each of the little creatures a good ſupper; for which purpoſe I had an egg boiled and very nicely chopped; I mixed up ſome bread and water very ſmooth, and put a little ſeed with the chopped egg amongſt it, and then carried it to the room where I left the neſts. But what was my concern, when I found that my care was too late for the greateſt part of them! Every Sparrow lay dead and bloody, they ſeemed to have killed each other. Urged I ſuppoſe by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme hunger, each ſpent on his unhappy aſſociates thoſe pecks and blows which were my proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert. In the neſt of Linnets, which were very young, I found one dead, two juſt expiring, and the other almoſt exhauſted, but ſtill able to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:027817_0075_0FD64E5E95C29E20"/>
to him, therefore, I immediately diſpenſed ſome of the food I had prepared, which greatly revived him; and as I thought he would ſuffer with cold in the neſt by himſelf, I covered him over with wool, and had this morning the pleaſure of finding him quite recovered. What, all the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and three Linnets dead! ſaid Frederick, whoſe little eyes ſwam with tears at the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tale: And pray, Miſs Jenkins, have you ſtarved all the Blackbirds too? Not all, my little friend, anſwered Miſs Jenkins, but I muſt confeſs that ſome of them have fallen victims to my barbarous neglect; however, there are two fine once alive, which I ſhall, with the ſurviving Linnet, cheerfully reſign to the care of my dear Harriet, whoſe tenderneſs will, I hope, be rewarded by the pleaſure of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſing when they are old enough. But I beg you will ſtay and reſt yourſelves after your walk. Let me ſee the birds firſt, ſaid Frederick. That you ſhall do, anſwered Miſs Jenkins; and taking him by the hand, conducted him to the room in which ſhe kept them, accompanied by Miſs Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. She then fed the birds, and gave particular inſtructions for making their food, and declared that ſhe would never be a receiver of birds neſts any more, but expreſſed her apprehenſions that it would be difficult to wean Edward from his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity for taking them; however, ſaid ſhe, he is

                  </gap>ſure hours. Miſs Jenkins then took her young friends into the parlour to her Coverneſs (for her mamma was dead) who received them very kindly, and gave each of them a piece of cake and ſome fruit; after which Miſs Jenkins led them again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the room where the birds were, and very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully put the neſt, with the poor ſolitary Linnet, into one baſket, and that with the two Blackbirds into the other. Frederick was very urgent to carry the latter, which his ſiſter conſented to; and then, bidding adieu to their friend, they ſet off on their return home, attented by the maid as before.</p>
               <p>Well, Frederick, ſaid Miſs Harriet, as they walked along, what think you of birdneſting now? Should you like to occaſion the death of ſo many harmleſs little creatures? No, indeed, ſaid Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick; and I think Miſs Jenkins a very naughty girl for ſtarving them. She was to blame, but is now ſorry for her fault, my dear, therefore you muſt not ſpeak unkindly of her; beſides, you know, ſhe has no good mamma, as we have, to teach her what is proper; and her papa is obliged to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from home very often, and leave her to the care of a Governeſs, who perhaps was never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed herſelf to be tender to animals. With this kind of converſation they amuſed themſelves as they walked, every now and then peeping into their
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:027817_0077_0FD64E6139D83270"/>
baſkets to ſee their little birds, which were very lively and well. They entreated the maid to take them through the orchard, which had a gate that opened into a meadow that lay in their way, having no doubt of obtaining admittance, as it was the uſual hour for their friend Joe to work there. They accordingly knocked at the gate, which was immediately opened to them, and Frederick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted Joe to ſhew him the Robins neſt. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we proceed to this part of our Hiſtory, we muſt return to the Redbreſts, whom we left on the wing, flying back to the ivy-wall, in order to take their young ones abroad.</p>

               <p>AS the father entered the neſt, he cried out, with a cheerful voice, Well, my neſtlings are you all ready? Yes, they replied. The mother then advanced, and deſired that each of them would get upon the edge of the neſt. Robin and Peckſy ſprang up in an inſtant, but Dicky and Flapſy being ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, were not ſo expeditious. The hearts of the parents felt a rapturous delight at the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous view they had now of their young family who appeared to be ſtrong, vigorous, and lively: and, in a word, endued with every gift of nature
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:027817_0078_0FD64E63710F2C70"/>
requiſite to their ſucceſs in the world. Now, ſaid the father, ſtretch your wings a little, Robin, and flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them a little in this manner, (ſhewing him the way) and be ſure to obſerve my directions exactly. Very well ſaid he; do not attempt to fly yet, for here is neither air nor ſpace enough for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Walk gently after me to the wall, now hop and perch upon this branch, and as ſoon as you ſee me fly away, ſpread your wings and exert all the ſtrength you have to follow me. Robin acquitted himſelf to admiration, and alighted very ſafely on the ground. Now ſtand ſtill, ſaid the father till the reſt join us: Then going back, he called upon Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky to do the ſame as his brother had done; but Dicky was very fearful of fluttering his wings, for he had a great deal of cowardice in his diſpoſition, and expreſſed many apprehenſions that he ſhould not be able to reach the ground without falling, as they were at ſuch a great height from it. His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who was a very courageous bird, was quite an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with him. Why you fooliſh little thing, ſaid he, do you mean to ſtay in the neſt by yourſelf and ſtarve? I ſhall leave off bringing you food, I aſſure you. Do you think your wings were given to be always folded by your ſides, and that the whole employment of your life is to pick your feathers, and make yourſelf look pretty? Without exerciſe you cannot long enjoy health; beſides you will ſoon
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:027817_0079_0FD64E65F21BFCD8"/>
have your livelihood to earn, and therefore idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in you would be the height of folly; get up this inſtant. Dicky, intimidated by his father's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, got up, and advanced as far as the branch from which he was to deſcend; but here his fears returned, and inſtead of making an effort to fly, he ſtood flapping his wings in a moſt irreſolute manner, and ſuffered his father to lead the way twice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out following him. This good parent, finding he would not venture to fly, took a circuit unpercei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Dicky, and watching the opportunity when his wings were a little ſpread, came ſuddenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, and puſhed him off from the branch. Dicky, finding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed his pinions, and upborn by the air, gently deſcended to the ground, ſo near the ſpot where Robin ſtood, that the latter eaſily reached him by hopping. The mother now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to conduct Flapſy and Peckſy, whildſt the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtaid to take care of the two already landed. Flapſy made a thouſand difficulties, but at length yielded to her mother's perſuaſions, and flew ſafely down.

                  </gap>vered from the fatigue and fright of their firſt eſſay at flying, they began to look around them with aſtoniſhment.
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:027817_0080_0FD64E69903E0138"/>
Every object on which they turned their eyes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited their curioſity and wonder. They were no longer confined to a ſmall neſt, built in a ſmall hole, but were now at full liberty in the open air. The orchard itſelf appeared to them a world. For ſome time each remained ſilent, gazing around, firſt at one thing, and then at another: at length Flapſy cried out, what a charming place the world is! I had no conception it was half ſo big! And do you ſuppoſe then, replied the mother, that you now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the whole world? I have ſeen but a ſmall part of it myſelf, and yet have flown over ſo large a ſpace, that what is at preſent within our view ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me a little inconſiderable ſpot, and I have converſed with ſeveral foreign birds, who informed me that the country they came from was ſo far diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, that they were many days on their journey hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though they flew the neareſt way, and ſcarcely allowed themſelves any reſting time. Come, ſaid the father, let us proceed to buſineſs, we did not leave the neſt merely to look about us. You are now, my young ones, ſafely landed on the ground, let me inſtruct you what you are to do on it. Every living creature that comes into the world has ſomething allotted him to perform, and therefore ſhould not
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:027817_0081_0FD64E6B3787CE18"/>
ſtand an idle ſpectator of what others are doing. We ſmall birds have a very eaſy taſk in compariſon of many animals I have had an opportunity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, being only required to ſeek food for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, build neſts, and provide for our young ones till they are able to procure their own livelihood. We have indeed enemies to dread; Hawks and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther birds of prey will catch us up, if we are not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our guard; but the worſt of foes we have are thoſe of the human race; though even among them Redbreſts have a better chance than many other birds, on account of a charitable action which a pair of our ſpecies are ſaid to have performed to a little boy and girl <note n="†" place="bottom">Alluding to the ballad of the children of the wood.</note> who were loſt in a wood where they were ſtarved to death. The Redbreaſts I mentioned ſaw the affectionate pair hand in hand, ſtretched on the cold ground, and would have fed them had they been capable of receiving nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but finding them quit dead, and being una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bury them, reſolved to cover them with leaves. This was an arduous taſk, but many a Redbreaſt has ſince ſhared the reward of it, and I believe that thoſe that do good to others, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways meet with a recompence ſome way or other.
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:027817_0082_0FD64E6C8B1EC958"/>
But I declare I am doing the very thing I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving you for—chattering away when I ſhould be minding buſineſs. Come, hop after me, and we ſhall ſoon find ſomething worth having. Fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for you are now in a place of ſecurity; there is no Hawk near, and I have never ſeen any of the human race enter this orchard, but the monſters who paid you viſits in the neſt, and others equally inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. The father then hopped away, followed by Robin and Dicky, whilſt his mate conducted the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male part of the family. The parents inſtructed the young ones in what manner to ſeek for food, and they proved very ſucceſsful, for there were a great number of inſects juſt at hand. Dicky had the good fortune to find four little worms together, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of calling his brothers and ſiſters to partake of them, he devoured them all himſelf. Are you not aſhamed you little greedy creature? cried his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who obſerved his ſelfiſh diſpoſition, What would you think of your brothers and ſiſters, were they to ſerve you ſo? In a family, every individual might to conſult the welfare of the whole, inſtead <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

aſide <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> conſiderations, which are the laſt which ever find place in a generous breaſt, how great is the pleaſure of doing good, and contributing to the happineſs of others! Dicky was quite confounded and immediately hopped away, if poſſible to find ſomething for his brother and ſiſter, that he might regain their good opinion.</p>
               <p>In the mean while Robin found a caterpillar, which he intended to take for Peckſy; but juſt as he was going to pick it up, a Linnet, who had a neſt in the orchard, ſnatched it from him and flew away with. Inflamed with the moſt furious rage. Robin ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nced to his father, and entreated he would fly after the Linnet and tear his heart out. That would be taking violent revenge indeed, ſays his father. No, Robin, the linnet has as great a right to the caterpillar as you or I; and in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability. has many little gaping mouths at home ready to receive it. But, however this may be, I had, for my own part, rather ſuſtain an injury than take revenge. You muſt expect to have many a ſcramble of this kind in your life; but if you give way to a reſentful temper, you will do yourſelf more harm than all the enemies in the world can do you; for you will be in perpetual agitation from an idea, that every one who does not act in direct conformity to your wiſhes, has a deſign againſt you. Therefore, reſtrain your anger that you may be
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:027817_0084_0FD64E739C843F48"/>
happy; for believe me, peace and tranquility are the moſt valuable things you can poſſeſs. At this inſtant Peckſy came with a fine fat ſpider in her mouth, which ſhe laid at her mother's feet, and thus addreſſed her: Accept, my dear parent, the firſt tribute of gratitude which I have ever been able to offer you. How have I formerly longed to eaſe thoſe toils which you and my dear father endured for our ſakes; and gladly would I now releaſe you from farther fatigue on my account, but I am ſtill a poor unexperienced creature, and muſt continue to take ſhelter under your wing. All my power to aſſiſt you ſhall however be exerted, and I will hop as long as I am able to procure proviſions for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. The eyes of the mother ſparkled with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; and knowing that Peckſy's love by a refuſal would be diſappointed ſhe eat the ſpider, which the dutiful neſtling had ſo affectionately brought her, and then ſaid—How happy would families be, if every one like you, my dear Peckſy, conſulted the the happineſs of the reſt, inſtead of turning their whole attention to their own intereſt. Dicky was not preſent at this ſpeech, which he mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The young Redbreaſts ſoon after all collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether near the gate which led into the meadow, when they were ſuddenly alarmed with a repetition of the ſame noiſes which had formerly ſo terrified them in the neſt; and Robin, who was foremoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held to his very great amazement, Maſter and Miſs Benſon, the maid who attended them, and Joe the gardener, who having opened the gate, was, at the requeſt of his young Maſter and Miſtreſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting to the ivy wall. Robin, with all his courage, and indeed he was not deficient in this qualification was ſeized with a great tremor; for if the view he had of the face of theſe perſons had appeared ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him as he ſat in the neſt, what muſt it now be, to behold their full ſize, and ſee them advancing with he thought, gigantic ſtrides, towards him! He expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing leſs than to be cruſhed to death with the foot of one of them; and not yet having attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his full ſtrength, and never having raiſed himſelf in the air, he knew not how to eſcape; therefore chirped ſo loudly, as not only to ſurprize his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſiſters, and bring his father and mother to enquire the meaning of his cry, but alſo to at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the attention of Maſter and Miſs Benſon—what chirping is that? cried the latter—It was, cried the maid, the cry of a young bird, was it not one of thoſe in the baſkets? No, ſaid Frederick, the noiſe came that way, pointing to ſome currant trees. —My birds are very well, and ſo is my Linnet, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Harriet—Frederick then ſet down his charge very carefully, and began looking about the place from whence he ſuppoſed the noiſe proceeded, when to his great joy he ſoon diſcovered the Redbreaſts and their little family. He called eagerly to his ſiſter, who was equally pleaſed with the figh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Frederick then ſtooped down to take a nearer view of them, by which means he directy fronted Robin who, as ſoon as the young gentleman's face was on a level with his eyes recollected him, and called to his brothers and ſiſters, told them they need not be afraid. Miſs Benſon followed her brother's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and delighted the little flock with a ſight of her benign countenance. She heartily lamented having nothing with which to regale her old favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites and their family, when Frederick produced from his pocket a piece of biſcuit which they crumbled and ſcattered. Miſs Benſon recollecting that her mamma would expect her at home, and that the birds in the baſket would be hungry, perſuaded her brother to take up his little load and return; they therefore left the Redbreaſts enjoying the fruits of their bounty.</p>

               <p>WHEN the happy birds had ſhared amongſt them the acceptable preſent made by their young benefactors, the mother reminded her mate that it would be proper to think of returning to the neſt.

She complied with his deſire, and when they were ſufficiently reſted, got up, on which the whole brood inſtantly raiſed themſelves on their feet. Now Robin, cried the father, let us ſee your dexterity at flying; come, I will ſhew you how to raiſe yourſelf, O! you need not take that trouble, ſaid the conceited bird, as I flew down, I warant I know how to fly up: then ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his wings, he attempted to riſe, but in ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilful a manner, that he only ſhuffled along upon the ground. That will not do, however, cried the father, ſhall I ſhew you now? Robin, perſiſted in it that he ſtood in no need of inſtruction, and tried again; he managed to raiſe himſelf a little way, but
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:027817_0088_0FD64E7BD3E87750"/>
ſoon tumbled headlong. His mother then began reproving him for his obſtinacy, and adviſed him to accept his father's kind offer of teaching him. You may depend on it, Robin, ſaid ſhe, that he is in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very reſpect wiſer than you, and as he has had ſo much practice, he muſt of courſe be expert in the art of flying; and if you perſiſt in making your own fooliſh experiments, you will only commit a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of errors, and make yourſelf rediculous; I ſhould commend your courage, provided you would add prudence to it; but blundering on in this ignorant manner, is only raſhneſs. Let him alone, let him alone, ſaid the father; if he is above being taught he may find his own way to the neſt, I will teach his brother. Come, ſaid he, Dicky, let us ſee what you can do at flying upwards, you cut a noble figure this morning when you flew down. Dicky, with reluctance, advanced; he ſaid he did not ſee what occaſion they had to go back to the neſt at all; he ſhould ſuppoſe they might eaſily find ſome corner to creep into, till they were ſtrong enough to rooſt in trees, as other birds did. Why you, ſaid the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are as ridiculous with your timidity, as Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin with his conceitedneſs. Thoſe who give way to groundleſs fears, generally expoſe themſelves to real dangers; if you reſt on the earth all night, you will ſuffer a great deal from cold and damp, and may very likely be devoured whilſt you ſleep, by
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:027817_0089_0FD64E8061106AA0"/>
rats and other creatures that go out in the night to ſeek for food; whereas, if you determine to go back to the neſt, you have but one effort to make; for which, I will venture to ſay, you have a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient degree of ſtrength, and then you will lie warm, ſafe, and quiet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> however, do as you will. Dicky began to think it was his intereſt to obey his father, and ſaid he would endeavour to fly up, but was ſtill fearful he ſhould not be able to effect it. Never deſpair, replied his father, of doing what others have done before you. Turn your eyes upwards, and behold what numbers of birds are at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſoaring in the air. They were once all neſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, like yourſelf. See there that new-fledged Wren, with what courage he ſkims along? Let it not be ſaid, that a Redbreaſt lies groveling on the earth, whilſt a Wren ſoars above him! Dicky was now aſhamed of himſelf, and inſpired with emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: therefore, without delay, ſpread his wings and his tail; his father with pleaſure placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a proper attitude before him, then riſing from the ground, led the way, and Dicky, by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully following his example, ſafely arrived at the neſt, which he found a moſt comfortable reſting place after the fatigue of the morning, and rejoiced that he had a good father to teach him what was moſt conducive to his welfare.</p>
               <p>The father having ſeen him ſafe home, returned
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:027817_0090_0FD64E815A8D0AF8"/>
to his mate, who during his ſhort abſence, had been endeavouring to convince Robin of his fault, but to no purpoſe; he did not like to be taught, what he ſtill perſuaded himſelf he could do by his own exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſhe therefore applied herſelf to Flapſy. Come my dear, ſaid ſhe, get ready to follow me when your father returns, for the ſun caſts a great heat here, and the neſt will be quite comfortable to you. Flapſy dreaded the experiment; however, as ſhe could not but blame both Robin's and Dicky's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſhe reſolved to do her beſt; but entreated her mother to inform her very particularly how to proceed. Well then, ſaid the tender parent, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve me. Firſt bend your legs, then ſpring from the ground as quick as you can, ſtretching your wings as you riſe, ſtraight out on each ſide of your body; ſhake them with a quick motion, as you will ſee me do, and the air will yield to you, and at the ſame time ſupport your weight; which ever way you want to turn, ſtrike the air with the wing on the contrary ſide, and that will bring you about. She then roſe from the ground, and having practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two or three times repeatedly, what ſhe had been teaching, Flapſy at length ventured to follow her, but with a palpitating heart; and was ſoon happily ſeated in the neſt by the ſide of Dicky, who rejoiced that his favourite ſiſter was ſafely arrived.</p>
               <p>The mother bird now went back to Peckſy, who
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:027817_0091_0FD64E8319481F48"/>
was waiting with her father till ſhe returned; for the good-parent choſe to leave the female part of his family to the particular management of their mother. Peckſy was fully prepared for her flight, for ſhe had attentively obſerved the inſtruction given to the others, and alſo their errors; ſhe therefore kept the happy medium betwixt ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and timidity, indulging that moderated emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ought to poſſeſs every young heart; and reſolving that neither her inferiors nor equals ſhould ſoar about her, ſhe ſprang from the ground, and with a ſteadineſs and agility, wonderful for her firſt eſſay, followed her mother to the neſt, who now reſted herſelf, waiting with impatience for the arrival of Robin and her mate; but Robin diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed her hopes, for he ſat ſulky; though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he had been in the wrong, he would not humble himſelf to his father; who therefore reſolved to leave him a little while, taking his ſtand, however, on a adjoining tree that he might be at hand to aſſiſt him ſhould he repent of his folly: as ſoon as Robin found himſelf deſerted, inſtead of being ſorry, he gave way to anger and reſentment; —Why, cried he, am I to be treated in this manner, who am the eldeſt of the family, whilſt all the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle darlings are fondled and carreſſed? but I don't care, I can get to the neſt yet, I make no doubt; he then attempted to fly, and after a great many
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:027817_0092_0FD64E840E527548"/>
trials, at length got up in the air, but knew not which way to direct his courſe; and ſometimes turned to the right, and ſometimes to the left; now he advanced forwards a little, and now, fearing he was wrong, came back again: at length quite ſpent with fatigue, he fell to the ground and bruiſed himſelf a good deal; ſtunned with the fall, he lay for ſome minutes without ſenſe or motion, but ſoon revived; and finding himſelf alone in this diſmal condition, the horrors of his ſituation filled him with dreadful apprehenſions, and the bittereſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe. Oh! cried he, that I had but followed the advice and example of my tender parents, then had I been ſafe in the neſt, bleſt with their kind careſſes, and enjoying the company of my dear brother and ſiſters! but now I am of all birds, the moſt wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! never ſhall I be able to fly, for every joint of me has received a ſhock which I doubt it will not recover. Where ſhall I find ſhelter from the ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſun, whoſe piercing rays already render the ground I lie on intolerably hot? What kind beak will ſupply me with food to aſſuage the pangs of hunger which I ſhall ſoon feel? By what means ſhall I procure even a drop of water to quench that thirſt which ſo frequently returns? Who will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect me from the various tribes of barbarous animals which I have been told make a prey of birds? Oh! my dear, my tender mother, if the ſound of my
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:027817_0093_0FD76EA7337F9800"/>
voice can reach your ears, pity my condition, and fly to my ſuccour. The kind parent waited not for farther ſolicitation, but darting from the branch on which ſhe had been a painful eye-witneſs of Robin's fall, ſhe inſtantly ſtood before him. I have liſtened, ſaid ſhe, to your lamentations; and ſince you ſeem convinced of your error, will not add to your ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering by my reproaches; my heart relents to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, and gladly would I afford you all the aſſiſtance in my power: but alas! I can do but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for your relief; however, let me perſuade you, to exert all the ſtrength you have, and uſe every effort for your own preſervation; I will endeavour to procure you ſome refreſhment, and at the ſame time contrive means of fixing you in a place of more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ecurity and comfort, than that in which you at preſent lie. So ſaying, ſhe flew to a little ſtream which flowed in an adjacent meadow, and fetched from the brink of it, a worm which ſhe had obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap> angler to drop as ſhe perched on the tree; with this ſhe immediately returned to the penitent Robin, who received the welcome gift with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Refreſhed with this delicious morſel, and comforted by his mother's kindneſs, he was able to ſtand up, and on ſhaking his wings, found that he was not ſo greatly hurt as he apprehended; his head, indeed, was bruiſed, ſo that one eye was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt cloſed, and he had injured the joint of one
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:027817_0094_0FD76EA5B659BDF8"/>
wing ſo that he could not poſſibly fly: however, he could manage to hop, and the parent bird ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that Joe the gardener was cutting a haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn hedge, which was near the ſpot, deſired Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin to follow her; this he did, tho' with great pain. Now, ſaid ſhe, look carefully about, and you will ſoon find inſects of one kind or another for your ſuſtenance, during the remainder of the day, and before evening I will return to you again. Summon all your courage, for I make no doubt you will be ſafe whilſt our friend continues his work, as none of thoſe creatures which are enimies to birds will venture to come near him. Robin took a ſorrowful farewel, and the mother flew to the neſt. You have been abſent a long time, my love, ſaid her mate, but I perceived that you were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging your tenderneſs towards that diſobedient neſtling, who has rendered himſelf unworthy of it; however, I do not condemn you for giving him aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, for had not you undertaken the taſk, I would myſelf have flown to him, inſtead of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home; how is he, likely to live and reward your kindneſs? Yes, ſaid ſhe, he will, I flatter myſelf, ſoon perfectly recover, for his hurt is not very conſiderable; and I have the pleaſure to tell you, he is extremely ſenſible of his late folly, and I dare ſay will endeavour to repair his fault with future good behaviour: this is pleaſing news indeed
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:027817_0095_0FD64E88ED9528B0"/>
ſaid he. The little neſtlings delighted to hear their dear brother ſafe, and convinced of his error; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the utmoſt joy and ſatisfaction, and entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their father to let them deſcend again to keep him company; to this he would by no means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, becauſe, as he told them, the fatigue would be too great; and it was proper that Robin ſhould feel a little longer the conſequences of his preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: to-morrow, ſaid he, you ſhall pay him a viſit, but to-day he muſt be by himſelf: on this they dropped their requeſt, knowing that their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent was the beſt judge what was proper to be done; and not doubting, but that his affection would lead him to every thing that was conducive to the real happineſs of his family: but yet they could not tell how to be happy without Robin, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually perking up their little heads, fancying they heard his cries; both the father and mother frequently took a peep at him, and had the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of ſeeing him very ſafe by their friend Joe the gardner. But it is time to enquire after Maſter and Miſs Benſon.</p>

               <p>THIS happy pair arrived at the houſe ſoon after they left the Redbreaſts, and communicated every circumſtance of their expedition to their kind
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:027817_0096_0FD64E8AE468A208"/>
mamma; who hearing their little priſoners in the baſket chirp very loudly, deſired they would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately go and feed them; which they gladly did, and then took a ſhort leſſon. Mrs. Benſon told Miſs Harriet that ſhe was going to make a viſit in the afternoon, and ſhould take her with her, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſired ſhe would keep herſelf quite ſtill, that ſhe might not be fatigued after the walk ſhe had had in the morning; for though ſhe meant to go in the coach, it was her intention to return on foot, as the weather was ſo remarkably fine. The young lady took great care of the birds, and Frederick engaged, with the aſſiſtance of the maid, to feed them during her abſence. Miſs Benſon was then dreſſed to attend her mamma. Mrs. Addis, to whoſe houſe they were going, was a widow lady; ſhe had two children, Maſter Charles a boy of twelve years old at ſchool, and Miſs Auguſta about ſeven at home. But theſe children were quite ſtrangers to Miſs Benſon. On entering the hall, the young lady took notice of a very diſagreeable ſmell, and was ſurpriſed with the appearance of a parrot, a paroquet, and a macaw, all in moſt elegant cages. In the next room ſhe came to, were a ſquirrel and a monkey, which had each a little houſe neatly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namented.</p>
               <p>On being introduced into the drawing-room ſhe
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:027817_0097_0FD64E8BDF9E0E20"/>
obſerved in one corner a lap dog lying on a ſplendid cuſhion; and in a beautiful little cradle, which ſhe ſuppoſed to contain a large wax doll, lay, in great ſtate, a cat with a litter of kittens. In vain did Miſs Harriet look for Mrs. Addis's children, for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them appeared. After the uſual compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſalutation were over, I have, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, taken the liberty of bringing my daughter with me, madam, in hopes of inducing you to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour us in return, with the company of Maſter and Miſs Addis. You are very obliging, Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the lady; but indeed I never take my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with me, they are ſo rude; on the contrary, I am obliged to keep the boy almoſt continually at ſchool, for he is ſo cruel to my dear little precious creatures, that there is no bearing him at home; and as for Auguſta, it will be time enough ſome years hence for her to go a viſiting. I am ſorry to hear you ſay this, madam, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, but hope my daughter will at leaſt be indulged with ſeeing Miſs Addis to-day, or I ſhall think you are diſpleaſed at my bringing Harriet here. This in reality was the caſe, and Mrs. Benſon percieved it, for the lady looked very croſs; however, ſhe could not refuſe having her daughter come into the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing room, as her gueſt ſo particularly deſired it. Miſs Harriet was very curious to examine the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us animals which were collected together by this
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:027817_0098_0FD64E8D5E3E0120"/>
extraordinary lady; but as her mamma never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered her to run about when ſhe accompanied her to other people's houſes, ſhe ſat down and kept quite ſtill, only glancing her eye firſt to one part of the room, and then to the other, as her attention was ſucceſſively attracted. Mrs. Addis rang the bell, and ordered that Auguſta might come to her. The footman, who had never before received ſuch a command, (for Mrs. Addis only ſaw the child in the nurſery) ſtared with aſtoniſhment, and thought he had miſtaken it. However, on his miſtreſs's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating, "that the little girl was to be brought down," he went to tell the nurſery-maid to take her. What new fancy is this? ſaid ſhe, Who would ever have thought of <hi>her</hi> wanting the <hi>child in the drawing-room?</hi> I have no ſtockings clean for her, not a frock to put on but what is all to pieces; I wiſh ſhe would ſpend leſs on her <hi>cats,</hi> and <hi>dogs,</hi> and <hi>monkies,</hi> and then her <hi>child</hi> might appear as ſhe ought to do. I won't go up ſtairs, Nancy, ſaid the child, mamma is ſo croſs to me. But you <hi>muſt,</hi> ſaid Nancy; beſides, there is a pretty young lady come to ſee you; and if you will go like a good girl, you ſhall have a piece of ſugar'd bread and butter for your ſupper, and you ſhall carry the doll which your good-mamma gave you, to ſhew your little viſitor. Theſe bribes had the deſired effect,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:027817_0099_0FD64EDC36648B98"/>
and Miſs Auguſta went into the drawing-room; but inſtead of entering it like a young lady, with a genteel curtſey, ſhe ſtopped at the door, hung down her head, and looked like a little ſimpleton. Miſs Benſon was ſo ſurprized at her awkwardneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſhe did not know what to do, and looked at her mamma; who ſaid, Harriet, my love, can't you take the little lady by the hand and lead her to me? I believe ſhe is afraid of ſtrangers. On this Miſs Harriet aroſe to do ſo; but Auguſta, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive that ſhe would ſnatch her doll away, was going to run out, only ſhe was not able to open the door. Mrs Benſon was quite ſhocked to ſee how ſickly, dirty, and ragged this child was, and what a very vulgar figure ſhe made, for want of inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but Mrs. Addis was ſo taken up at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant with the old lap-dog, which had, as ſhe thought, fallen into a fit, that ſhe did not mind her entrance; and before ſhe perceived it, the child went up to the cradle in order to put her doll into it; and ſeized one of the kittens by the neck, the ſqueaking of which, provoked the old cat to ſcratch her, and this made her cry and drop the kitten on the floot. Mrs. Addis ſeeing this, flew to the little beaſt, endeavoured to ſooth it with careſſes, and
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:027817_0100_0FD625927366DBF8"/>
was going to beat Auguſta for touching it, but Mrs. Benſon interceded for her; though ſhe could ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gain attention, Mrs. Addis being ſo greatly agitated. Tea was now ordered, and Miſs Auguſta being urgent to go to her maid, Mrs. Benſon thought it beſt ſhe ſhould be indulged; and therefore ſaid, ſhe was ſure Harriet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The tea things being ſet, the footman came in with the urn, which employing both his hands, he left the door open; and was, to the great terror of Miſs Harriet, and even of her mamma too, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the monkey they ſaw in the hall, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broke his chain, came to make a viſit to his lady: ſhe, far from being diſconcerted, ſeemed highly pleaſed with his cleverneſs. O my ſweet dear p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Pray ſhew how like a gentleman you can behave: juſt as ſhe had ſaid this, he leaped upon the tea-table, and took cup after cup, and threw them on the ground, till he broke half the ſet; then jumped on the back of his miſtreſs's chair, and tore the cover
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:027817_0101_0FD64EAB5E6422D8"/>
of it; in ſhort, as ſoon as he had finiſhed one piece of miſchief, he began another; till Mrs. Addis' though vaſtly diverted with his wit, was obliged to to have him caught and confined; after which ſhe began making tea, and quietneſs was for a ſhort time reſtored. But Mrs. Benſon, though capable of converſing on moſt ſubjects, could not engage Mrs. Addis in any diſcourſe, but upon the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her birds and beaſts; and a variety of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſting particulars were related, concerning their wit or misfortunes. On hearing the clock ſtrike ſeven, ſhe begged Mrs. Benſons's excuſe; but ſaid ſhe made it a conſtant rule, to ſee all her dear darlings fed at that hour, and entreated that ſhe and the young lady would take a turn in the garden in the mean-while. This was very unpolite, but Mrs. Benſon deſired ſhe would uſe no ceremonies with her, and was really glad of the reſpite it gave her from company ſo irkſome: and Miſs Harriet was happy to be alone with her mamma: ſhe, however, forbore to make any remarks on Mrs. Addis, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had been taught, that it did not become young perſons to cenſure the behaviour of thoſe who were older than themſelves. The garden was ſpacious, but overrun with weeds; the gravel-walks
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:027817_0102_0FD64EAE6B282C08"/>
were ſo rough for want of rolling, that it was quite painful to tread on them: and the graſs on the lawn ſo long, that there was no walking with any comfort, for the gardner was almoſt continually going on ſome errand or another for Mrs. Addis's darlings; ſo Mrs. Benſon and her daughter ſat down on a garden-ſeat, with an intention of waiting there till Mrs. Addis ſhould ſummon them. Miſs Harriet could not refrain from expreſſing a wiſh that it was time to go home; to which Mrs. Benſon replied, that ſhe did not wonder at her deſire to return, but, ſaid ſhe, my dear, as the world was not made merely for us, we muſt endeavour to be patient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every diſagreeable circumſtance we meet with. I know what opinion you have formed of Mrs. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, and ſhould not have brought you to be a ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator of her follies, had I not hoped that an hour or two paſſed in her company would afford you a leſſon which might be uſeful to you through life. I have before told you, that our affections towards the inferior parts of the creation ſhould be properly <hi>regulated;</hi> you have, in your friend Miſs Jenkins and her brother, ſeen inſtances of cruelty to them, which I am ſure you will never be inclined to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; but I was apprehenſive you might fall into
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:027817_0103_0FD64EB0A398BF48"/>
the contrary extreme, which is equally blameable. Mrs. Addis you ſee, has abſolutely transferred the affection ſhe ought to feel for her child, to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures who would really be happier without it. As for puſs who lies in the cradle in all her ſplendor, I will engage to ſay, ſhe would paſs her time plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanter in a baſket of clean ſtraw, placed in a ſituation where ſhe could occaſionally amuſe herſelf with catching mice. The lap dog is, I am ſure, a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable object, full of deſeaſes, the conſequences of luxurious living. How enviable is the lot of a ſpaniel, that is at liberty to be the companion of his maſter's walks, when compared with his! Mr. Pug I am certain would enjoy himſelf much more in his native wood. And I am greatly miſtaken, if the parrots, &amp;c. have not cauſe to wiſh themſelves in their reſpective countries, or at leaſt divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeparate families, where they would be better attended; for Mrs. Addis, by having ſuch a number of creatures, has put it out of her power to ſee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly with her own eyes to all. But come, let us go back into the houſe, the time for our going home draws near, and I wiſh not to prolong my viſit. Saying this ſhe aroſe, and with her daughter went into the the drawing room, which opened into the garden; the other door which led to the adjoining apartments was not ſhut, and gave them an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of hearing what really diſtreſſed Mrs. Benſon,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:027817_0104_0FD64EB223FD45A8"/>
and perfectly terrified the gentle Harriet. "Be gone, wretch," ſays Mrs. Addis, "be gone this inſtant, you ſhall not ſtay a moment longer in this houſe." "I hope, Madam, you will have the goodneſs to give me a character; indeed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I fed Poll, but I believe he got cold when you let him ſtand out of doors the other day." "I will give you no character I tell you, ſo depart this inſtant. Oh my poor, dear, dear creature! I fear you will never recover; John, Thom, here run this inſtant to Perkins the bird-catcher, perhaps he can tell me what to give him;" then burſting into a flood of tears, ſhe ſat down and forgot her gueſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mrs. Benſon thought it neceſſary to remind her, that ſhe was in the houſe, and ſtepped to the door to aſk what was the matter. Mrs. Addis recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herſelf ſufficiently, to beg pardon for neglecting to pay attention to her, but declared, that the dreadful misfortune that had befallen her, had made her inſenſible to every thing elſe. What can the matter be? ſaid Mrs. Benſon. Have you heard of the death of a dear friend; has your child met with an accident! Oh! no, ſaid ſhe, but dear Poll is taken ſuddenly ill; my dear Poll which I have had theſe ſeven years, and I fear he never will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. If this is all, madam, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, I really cannot pity you, nor excuſe your behaviour to me: for it is an inſtance of diſreſpect which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:027817_0105_0FD64EB528C55120"/>
no other perſon but yourſelf would ſhew me, and I ſhall take my leave of your houſe for ever: but before I go, permit me to ſay, that you act in a very wrong manner, and will certainly feel the ill effects of your injuſtice to your fellow-creatures, in thus robbing them of the love you owe them, to laviſh it away on thoſe who are really ſufferers by your kindneſs. At this inſtant the footman enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inform Mrs. Benſon that her ſervant was come, on which, accompanied by Miſs Harriet, ſhe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further ceremony, left Mrs. Addis to compoſe herſelf as ſhe could.</p>
               <p>As they walked along, both Mrs. Benſon and her daughter continued ſilent, for the former was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agitated, and the latter quite in conſternation at what had lately paſſed, but their attention was ſoon awakened by the ſupplication of a poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who entreated them to give her ſome relief, as ſhe had a ſick huſband and ſeven children in a ſtarving condition; of which, ſhe ſaid they might be eye-witneſſes, if they would have the goodneſs to ſtep into a barn hard by. The invitation of wretchedneſs never was given in vain to Mrs. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: her heart was ever awake to the tender feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of humanity; and taking her daughter by the hand, and deſiring the ſervant to ſtop for her, ſhe followed the woman, who conducted her to the manſions of real woe, where ſhe beheld a father,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:027817_0106_0FD64EBA9E568E48"/>
ſurrounded with his helpleſs family, whom he could no longer ſupply with ſuſtenance; and he himſelf, though his diſeaſe was ſubdued, was almoſt on the point of expiring, for want of ſome reviving cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial. How come you to be in this condition, good woman? ſaid Mrs. Benſon to his wife, ſurely you might have obtained relief before your huſband was reduced to ſuch extremity? Oh! my good Lady, ſaid the woman, we have not been uſed to beg, but to earn an honeſt livelihood by our induſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and never till this ſad day, have I known what it was to aſk charity: and the firſt time I could bring myſelf to do it, I made application at the only great houſe in this village, where I made no doubt there was abundance. I told my diſmal tale to a ſervant, and begged ſhe would make it known to her miſtreſs; but ſhe aſſured me it was in vain to come there, for her Lady had ſuch a family of cats, dogs, monkies, and all ſorts of creatures, that ſhe had nothing to ſpare for poor people; at the ſame inſtant I ſaw a poulterer bring a rabbit and a fowl, which I found were for the favourite cat and dog. This diſcouraged me from begging; and I had determined to die before I would aſk again; but the ſight of my dear huſband and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren in this condition, drives me to it. Well, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort yourſelf, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, I will take care of you all. Come to my houſe to-morrow morning.
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:027817_0107_0FD64ECF669E1BC0"/>
and we will ſee what we can do; in the mean time here is ſomething for a preſent ſupply. Mrs. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then departed, as ſhe was fearful of walking late. Miſs Harriet was greatly affected with this ſcene, and could no longer help exclaiming againſt Mrs. Addis. She is deſerving of great blame, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſaid Mrs. Benſon; but I have the pleaſure to ſay, ſuch characters as her's are very uncommon, I mean in the extreme; though there are numbers of people who fall into the ſame fault in ſome degree, and make themſelves truly ridiculous with their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural affections. I wiſh you, whilſt your mind is young, to guard it againſt ſuch a blamable weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Miſs Harriet aſſured her mamma, that ſhe ſhould never forget either Mrs. Addis or the leſſon ſhe had received on the ſubject, and then expreſſed her ſatisfaction that they had met the poor woman. I rejoice ſincerely, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, that I was fortunate enough to be in time to aſſiſt this poor wretched family, and hope, my love, you will out of your own little purſe, contribute ſomething to-morrow towards their relief. Moſt willingly, ſaid Harriet, they ſhall be welcome to my whole ſtore. They kept taking on this ſubject till they arrived at home. Little Frederick, who ſat up an hour beyond his time, came out to meet them, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured his ſiſter that the birds were well and faſt aſleep. I think, ſaid ſhe, it is time for you and I
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:027817_0108_0FD64EBD63773170"/>
to follow their example; for my part, with my morning and evening walk together, I am really tired, ſo ſhall beg leave to wiſh you a good night, my dear mamma; papa, I ſuppoſe will not be at home this week. No, my dear, nor the next, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, for he has many affairs to ſettle in the Weſt. I am rather fatigued alſo, and ſhall ſoon retire to reſt.</p>

               <p>WE will now return to Robin, whom we left under the protection of Joe the gardener, though the honoſt fellow did not know of his guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianſhip, and continued his work without perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the little cripple, who hopped and ſhuffled about, pecking here and there whatever he could meet with. When he had been for ſome time by himſelf, his mother made him another viſit, and told him ſhe had interceded with his father, whoſe anger was abated, and he would come to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went to reſt. Robin rejoiced to hear that there was a chance of his being reconciled to his father, yet he dreaded the firſt interview; however, as it muſt be, he wiſhed to have it over as ſoon as poſſible; and every wing he heard beat the air, he fancied to be that of his offended parent. In this
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:027817_0109_0FD64EBFB11ACD00"/>
ſtate of anxious expectation he continued almoſt to the time of ſun-ſetting, when, of a ſudden, he heard the well-known voice to which he uſed to liſten with joy, but which now cauſed his whole frame to tremble; but obſerving a beam of benignity in that eye, in which he looked for anger and reproach, he caſt himſelf in the moſt ſupplicating poſture at the feet of his father, who could no longer reſiſt the deſire he felt to receive him into ſavour. Your preſent humility, Robin, ſaid he, diſarms my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment; I gladly pronounce your pardon, and am perſuaded you will never again incur my diſpleaſure; we will therefore ſay no more on a ſubject which gives ſo much pain to both of us. Yes, my dear, my too indulgent father, cried Robin, permit me to make my grateful acknowledgements for your kindneſs, and to aſſure you of my future obedience. The delighted parent accepted his ſubmiſſion, and the reconciliation was compleated. Robin now felt himſelf greatly relieved; but on his father's aſking him what he intended to do with himſelf at night, his ſpirits ſunk again, and he anſwered, He did not know. Well, ſaid the father, I have thought of an expedient to ſecure you from cold at leaſt. In a part of the orchard, a very little way from hence, there is a place belonging to our friend the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener; there I have ſheltered myſelf from ſeveral ſtorms, and I am ſure it will afford you a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:027817_0110_0FD64EC1497FF220"/>
lodging; ſo follow me, before it is too late. The old bird then led the way, and his lame ſon followed him; when they arrived they found the door of the tool-houſe open, and as the threſhold was low, Robin managed to get over it. His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looked carefully about, and at laſt found, in a corner, a parcel of ſhreds, kept for the purpoſe of nailing up trees. Here, Robin, cried he, is a charming bed for you, let me ſee you in it, and call your mother to have a peep, and then I muſt bid you good night; ſo ſaying away he flew, and brought his mate, who was perfectly ſatisfied with the lodging, provided for her late undutiful, but now repentant ſon; but reminded by her mate that if they ſtaid longer they might be ſhut in, they took leave, telling Robin they would viſit him early in the morning. Though this habitation was much better than Robin expected, and he was ready enough to own, better than he deſerved, yet he deeply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted his abſence from the neſt, and longed to ſee again his brother and ſiſters; however, though part of the night was ſpent in bitter reflections, fatigue at length prevailed ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> anxiety, and he fell aſleep. The neſtlings were greatly pleaſed to find that Robin was likely to eſcape the dangers of the night, and even the anxious mother at length reſigned herſelf to repoſe. Before the ſun ſhewed

his glorious face in the eaſt, every individual of this affectionate family were awake; the father with impatience waited for the gardener's opening the tool-houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the mother prepared her little ones for a new excurſion. You will be able to deſcend with more eaſe, my dears, to-day, than you did yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, ſhall you not? O yes, mother, ſaid Dicky, I ſhall not be at all afraid; nor I, ſaid Flapſy. Say you ſo? then let us ſee which of you will be down firſt. Come, I will ſhew you the way. On this with gradual flight, the mother bent her courſe to a ſpot near the pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There they found him in his ſnug little bed: but who can deſcribe the happy meeting? who can find words to expreſs the raptures which filled every little boſom? When the firſt tranſports ſubſided, I think, ſaid the father, it will be beſt to retire from hence; if our friend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, he may take us for a ſet of thieves, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that we came to eat his ſeeds, and I ſhould be ſorry he ſhould have an ill opinion of us. Well, I am ready, ſaid his mate, and we, cried the whole

brood: they accordingly left the tool-houſe, and hopped about among the currant buſhes. I think, ſaid the father, that you who have the full uſe of your limbs, could manage to get up theſe low trees, but Robin muſt content himſelf on the ground a little longer. This was very mortifying, but there was no one to blame excepting himſelf: ſo he forbore to complain, and aſſumed as much cheerfulneſs as he could; his brother and ſiſters begged they might ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At the uſual hour of viſiting Mrs. Benſon's tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, the affectionate pair took their morning's flight, and found the young Gentleman and Lady with their mamma. They had been up a long time for Frederick had made his bed chamber a lodging for the birds, who had awakened both him and his ſiſter at a very early hour, and they roſe with great readineſs to perform the kind office they had impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on themſelves. The two blackbirds were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well, but the Linnet looked rather drooping, and they began to be apprehenſive they ſhould no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> raiſe him, eſpecially when they found he was not inclined to eat. As for the blackbirds, they were very hungry indeed; and their young benefactors not conſidering that when fed by their parents,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:027817_0113_0FD64EC843292C70"/>
young birds wait ſome time between every morſel, ſupplied them too faſt, and filled the ircrops ſo full, that they looked as if they had great wens on their necks; and Harriet perceived one of them gaſping for breath. Stop, Frederick, ſaid ſhe, as he was carrying the quil to its mouth, the bird is ſo full he can hold no more; but ſhe ſpoke too late; the little creature gave its eyes a ghaſtly roll, and fell on one ſide ſuffocated with abundance. Oh! he is dead! he is dead! cried Frederick; he is indeed, ſaid Miſs Benſon, but I am ſure we did not deſign to kill him; but it is ſome ſatisfaction to think we did not take the neſt. This conſideration was not enough to comfort Frederick, who began to cry moſt bitterly. His mamma hearing him, was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive he had hurt himſelf, for he ſeldom cried unleſs he was in great pain: ſhe therefore haſtily entered the room to enquire what was the matter, on which Miſs Harriet related the diſaſter that had happened. Mrs. Benſon then ſat down, and taking Frederick in her lap, wiped his eyes, and giving him a kiſs, ſaid, I am ſorry, my love, for your diſappointment but do not afflict yourſelf, the poor little thing is out of its pain now, and I fancy ſuffered but for a ſhort time. If you keep on crying ſo, you will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to feed your flock of birds, which I fancy by the chirping I heard from my window, are begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aſſemble. Come, let me take the object of
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:027817_0114_0FD64ECA1D1027B0"/>
of your diſtreſs out of your ſight, it muſt be buried: then carrying the dead bird in one hand, and leading Frederick by the other, ſhe went down ſtairs. Whilſt ſhe was ſpeaking, Miſs Harriet had been watching the other Blackbird, which ſhe had ſoon the pleaſure to ſee perfectly at his eaſe. She then attempted to feed the Linnet, but he would not eat. I fancy, Miſs, ſaid the maid, he wants air. That may be the caſe indeed, replied Miſs Benſon; for you know, Betty, this room which has been ſhut up all night, muſt be much cloſer than the places birds build in. Saying this ſhe opened the window, and placed the Linnet near it, waiting to ſee the effect of the experiment, which anſwered her wiſhes, and ſhe was delighted to behold how the little crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gradually ſmoothed his feathers, and his eyes reſumed their native luſtre; ſhe once more offered him food, which he took, and was quite recovered. Having done all in her power for her little orphans, ſhe went to ſhare with her brother the taſk of feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the daily priſoners, which being ended, ſhe ſeated herſelf at the breakfaſt table by her mamma. I wonder, ſaid Frederick, who had dried up his tears, that the Robins are not come. Conſider, replied his ſiſter, that they have a great deal of buſineſs to do, now their young ones begin to leave the neſt: they will be here by and by, I make no doubt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="unknown:027817_0115_0FD64ECCC48C2B58"/>Whilſt ſhe was ſpeaking the ſervant entered, and ſaid the poor woman was at the gate, who was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to attend there in the morning. Mrs. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon deſired ſhe might come up. Well, good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſaid the benevolent lady, how does your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band do this morning? Thanks to your goodneſs, Madam, and the bleſſing of God, quite cheery.</p>
               <p>Well, ſaid the Lady, I am happy to find you in better ſpirits than you were laſt night, and do not doubt you will do very well. I will order ſome meat and bread to be ſent you every day this week, and will alſo aſſiſt you in clothing the children. Harriet's eyes gliſtened with benevolence at ſeeing the woman, whoſe diſtreſs had ſo greatly affected her, thus comforted; and ſlipping her purſe, which contained ſeven ſhillings, into her mamma's hand, begged ſhe would take it for the woman. You ſhall, my dear, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, have the pleaſure of relieving her yourſelf, give this half-crown to her. Miſs Harriet, with a delight which none but the compaſſionate can know, extended the hand of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The woman received her benefaction with grateful acknowledgments; and praying that the Almighty might ſhower down his choiceſt bleſſings on this worthy family, reſpectfully took leave and
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:027817_0116_0FD64ECDDED29060"/>
returned to her huſband, who every hour gathered ſtrength.</p>
               <p>She was ſcarce gone out of the room, when the Redbreaſts entered, as I before related. The ſight of them perfectly reſtored Frederick's cheerfulneſs; and after they were departed he requeſted his mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, that he and Harriet might go again to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, in hopes of ſeeing the young Robins. That you ſhall do, Frederick, ſaid ſhe, upon condition that you continue a very good boy; but as yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day was rather an idle day with you, you muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a little cloſer to-day; and Harriet has a great deal of buſineſs to do, therefore you muſt wait till evening, and then perhaps I may go with you. Frederick was ſatisfied with this promiſe, and took great pains to learn to read and ſpell. He repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by heart all the hymns and other little things he had been taught; and Miſs Benſon applied herſelf to a variety of different leſſons with great aſſidui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and performed her taſk of work entirely to her mamma's ſatisfaction.</p>

               <p>AS ſoon as the old Redbreaſts left their little fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, in order to go to Mr. Benſon's, Peckſy, with great ſolicitude, began to aſk Robin where he had
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:027817_0117_0FD64ED20910A208"/>
hurt himſelf, and how he did? Oh! ſaid he, I am much better; but it is a wonder I am now alive, for you cannot think what a dreadful fall I had. With turning about as I did in the air, I became quite giddy, ſo could not make the leaſt exertion for ſaving myſelf as I was falling, and came with great force to the ground; you ſee how my eye is ſtill ſwelled; but that is nothing to what it was. My wing is the worſt, and ſtill gives me a great deal of pain; obſerve how it drags on the ground: but as it is not broke, my father ſays it will ſoon be well; and I hope it will be ſo, for I long to be flying, and ſhall be glad to recieve any inſtructions for the future. I cannot think how I could be ſo fooliſhly conceited, as to ſuppoſe I knew how to conduct myſelf without my father's guidance.</p>
               <p>Why, ſaid Peckſy, young creatures like us, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſtand in need of inſtruction, and ought to think ourſelves happy in having parents who are willing to take the trouble of teaching what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for us to know. I dread the day, when I muſt quit the neſt and take care of myſelf. Flapſy ſaid, ſhe made no doubt they ſhould know how to fly, and peck, and do every thing before that time; and for her part, ſhe longed to ſee the world, and to know how the higher ranks of birds behaved themſelves, and what pleaſure they enjoyed; and Dicky declared he formed the ſame wiſhes, though
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:027817_0118_0FD64ED34DA9D938"/>
he muſt confeſs, he had great dread of birds of prey; Oh! ſaid Flapſy, they will never ſieze ſuch a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty creature as you Dicky, I am ſure: why if beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can prevail againſt cruelty, you will alſo be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, my ſweet ſiſter, replied he, for your delicate engaging ſhape muſt plead in your behalf.</p>
               <p>Juſt as he had finiſhed his ſpeech, a hawk appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſight, on which the whole party was ſiezed with a moſt uncommon ſenſation, and involuntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threw themſelves on their backs, ſcreaming with all their might; and at the ſame inſtant the cries of numbers of little birds beſides, echoed through the orchard. The Redbreaſts ſoon recovered, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on their feet, looked about to ſee what was become of the cauſe of their conſternation; when they beheld him high in the air, bearing off ſome unhappy victim, a few of whoſe feathers fell near the young family, who on examining them found they belonged to a goldfinch; on which Peckſy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that it was evident theſe ſavages paid no attention to perſonal beauty. Dicky was ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied he knew not what to do, and had thought of flying back to the neſt; but after Robin's misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, was fearful of offending his father; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore got up into a currant-buſh, and hid himſelf in the thickeſt part of the leaves. Flapſy followed him, but Robin being obliged to keep on the ground, Peckſy kindly reſolved to bear him company.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="unknown:027817_0119_0FD64ED70BC67EF0"/>In a few minutes their parents returned from Mr. Benſon's, and found the two latter pretty near where they had left them; but miſſing the others, the mother with great anxiety enquired what was become of them? Robin then related how they had been frightened with a hawk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whilſt he was doing ſo, they returned to him again.</p>
               <p>I am ſurpriſed, ſaid the father, that a Hawk ſhould venture ſo near the ſpot where the gardener is at work. O, ſaid Peckſy, we have not ſeen him ſince you left us; then I dare ſay he is gone to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, replied the mother; and this was the caſe, for they at this inſtant ſaw him return with his ſhears in his hand, and ſoon purſue his work. Now you will be ſafe, cried the father; I ſhall therefore ſtay and teach you to fly in different directions, and then your mother and I ſhall make ſome little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, and leave you to practiſe by yourſelves; but firſt of all let me ſhew you how to get water, for I fear you muſt be very thirſty. No, ſaid they, we have had ſeveral wet worms and juicy caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which have ſerved us both for victuals and drink, Robin is very quick at finding them. There is nothing like neceſſity to teach birds how to live, ſaid the father; I am glad Robin's misfortunes have been ſo beneficial to him. What would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you, if you had not exerted yourſelves as I directed? ſaid the mother; you would ſoon have
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:027817_0120_0FD62590F8FE1298"/>
died, had you continued to lie on the ſcorching ground. Remember from this inſtant as long as you live, that it is better to uſe means for your own relief, than to ſpend time in fruitleſs lamentations.</p>
               <p>In reſpect to Hawks, ſaid the father, they are frightful creatures to be ſure; but there are very few of them in compariſon of moſt other birds, and they can take but one at a time, therefore it is a very great chance whether any of you is that one; your beſt way will be to keep as near to houſes as you can, and make yourſelves familiar with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and I think you will be in little danger. By the way, let me obſerve, how greatly indebted you are to this good gardener, whom I hope you no longer call a monſter. Oh no! ſaid Flapſy, he is a dear good creature. But I was going to ſay, cried the father, that at any rate, it would be wrong to make your life unhappy with appre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

                  </gap>ew they devour! But come along, Dicky, Flapſy and Peck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, there is water ſo near, that Robin can hop ſo far: he then conducted them to a pump, from whence Joe watered the garden, and under its ſpout, they found an ample ſupply of that delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:027817_0121_0FD64EDD9DBFAD48"/>
element, more acceptable to them than the moſt coſtly wine would have been.</p>
               <p>Here they ſtaid ſome time, and were greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſed; ſtill ſo near the gardener, that they regarded themſelves as under his protection. The parents flew up into a tree, and there the father entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his beloved mate and family with his chearful muſic; and ſometimes they made various airy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions for examples to their little ones, who all longed to be able to imitate them. In this manner the day paſſed happily away, and early in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flapſy, Peckſy, and Dicky, were conducted to the neſt; they mounted in the air with much more caſe than the preceding day, and the parents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them how to fly to the branches of ſome trees which ſtood near to the ivy-wall.</p>
               <p>In the mean time they had left Robin by himſelf, thinking he would be ſafe, whilſt the gardener was mowing ſome graſs; but what was the grief of both father and mother when they returned, and could neither ſee nor hear him. The gardener too was gone, they therefore apprehended that a cat or rat had taken him away and killed him, yet none of his feat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

him, but all in vain; the tool-houſe was lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but had he been there, he would have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: at length quite in deſpair of finding him, with heavy hearts they returned to the neſt; a general lamentation enſued, and this lately happy abode, was now a region of ſorrow. The father endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to comfort his mate and ſurviving neſtlings, and ſo far ſucceeded, that they reſolved to bear their loſs with patience.</p>
               <p>After a mournful night, the mother left the neſt early in the morning, unwilling to relinquiſh the hope which ſtill remained, of finding Robin again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If poor Robin is dead, he will ſuffer no more; and if he is not, ſo much as we fly about, it is a chance but we get tidings of him; ſuppoſe theſe little ones attempt to fly with us to your benefactors? If we ſet out early and let them reſt frequently by the way, I think they may accompliſh it. This was very pleaſing to every one of the little ones, for they longed to go thither, and accordingly it was

determined that they ſhould immediately ſet out, and they accompliſhed the journey by eaſy ſtages; at length they all arrived in the court, juſt after the daily penſioners were gone.</p>
               <p>Now, ſaid the father, ſtop a little, and let me adviſe you Dicky, Flapſy, and Peckſy, to behave yourſelves properly; hop only where you ſee your mother and me hop, and do not meddle with any thing, but what is ſcattered on purpoſe. Stay, father, ſaid Dicky, my feathers are ſadly rumpled, and ſo are mine, ſaid Flapſy. Well, ſmooth them then, ſaid the father, but don't ſtand finicking for an hour. Peckſy was ready in an inſtant, but the others were very tedious, ſo their father and mother would wait for them no longer, and flew into the window; the others directly followed them, and to the inexpreſſible ſatisfaction of Maſter Benſon alighted on the tea-table, where they met with a very unexpected pleaſure; for who ſhould they find there, as a gueſt, but the poor loſt Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin!

As for the young ones, they twittered a thouſand queſtions to Robin, but as he was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to diſturb his father's ſong, he deſired them to ſuſpend their curioſity to another opportunity.

               <head>CHAP. XV.</head>
               <p>YOU may remember that maſter Frederick ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from his mamma a promiſe that when the buſineſs of daily inſtruction was finiſhed, he and his ſiſter ſhould go into the orchard in ſearch of the Robins; as ſoon, therefore, as the air was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently cool, ſhe took them with her, and arrived juſt after the parent birds had taken the young ones back to the neſt. Robin was then left by himſelf, and kept hopping about, and fearing no danger, got into the middle of the walk. Frederick deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him at a diſtance, and eagerly called out, there's one of them, I declare; and before his mamma ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him, he ran to the place, and clapped his little hand over it, exulting that he had caught it. The preſſure of the hand hurt Robin's wing, who ſent forth piteous cries; on which Frederick
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:027817_0125_0FD64EEB44A2A540"/>
let him go, and ſaid, I won't hurt you, you little thing.</p>
               <p>Miſs Harriet, who ſaw him catch the bird, ran as faſt as poſſible to prevent his detaining it; and perceived that as Robin hopped away he was lame, on which ſhe concluded that her brother had hurt him; but on Frederick's aſſuring her that his wing hung down when he firſt ſaw him, Mrs. Benſon ſaid it was moſt likely he was lamed by ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which prevented his going with the others to the neſt: and if that is the caſe, ſaid ſhe, it will be humane and charitable to take care of him. Frederick was delighted to hear her ſay ſo, and aſked whether he might carry it home? Yes, ſaid his mamma, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you can take him ſafely. Shall I carry him Madam? ſaid Joe, he can lie nicely in my hat. This was an excellent ſcheme, and all parties ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of it; ſo Frederick took ſome of the ſoft graſs which was mowed down, to put at the bottom and poor Robin was ſafely depoſited in his vehicle which ſerved him for a litter; and perceiving into what hands he was fallen, he inwardly rejoiced, knowing that he had an excellent chance of being well provided for, as well as of ſeeing his dear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations again. I need not ſay that great care was taken of him, and you will eaſily ſuppoſe he had a more comfortable night than that he had paſſed in the ſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="unknown:027817_0126_0FD64EEB51D2C268"/>When Maſter and Miſs Benſon aroſe the next morning, one of their firſt cares was to feed the birds, and they had the pleaſure to ſee all their neſtlings in a thriving condition: both the Linnet and Blackbird now hopped out of their neſts to be fed, to the great diverſion of Maſter Frederick: but this pleaſure was ſoon damped by an unlucky acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; for the Blackbird being placed in a window which was open, hopped too near the edge, and fell to the ground, where he was ſnapped up by a dog, and torn to peices in an inſtant. Frederick began to cry as before; but on his ſiſter's reminding him, that the creature was paſt the ſenſe of pain, he reſtrained his tears, and turned his attention to the Linnet, which he put into a cage that he might not meet the ſame ſate. He then went to feed the flock and to enquire after Robin, whom Mrs. Benſon had taken into her own room, leſt Frederick ſhould handle and hurt him; to his great joy he found him much better, for he could begin to uſe his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured wing. Frederick was therefore truſted to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him into the breaſtfaſt parlour, where he placed him as has been already deſcribed.</p>
               <p>For ſome time the young Redbreaſts behaved ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well; but at length Dicky, familiarized by the kind treatment he met with, forgot his father's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:027817_0127_0FD64EEC9E06BCB0"/>
and began to hop about in a very rude manner; he even jumped into the plate of bread and butter; and having a mind to taſte the tea, hopped on the edge of a cup, but dipping his foot in the hot liquor, he was glad to make a haſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, to the great diverſion of Maſter Frederick. Flapſy took the freedom of pecking at the ſugar, but found it too hard for her tenden beak. For theſe liberties their mother reproved them, ſaying, ſhe would never bring them with her again, if they were guilty of ſuch rudeneſs, as to take what was not offered to them. As their longer ſtay would have broke in on a plan which Mrs. Benſon had concerted, ſhe rung her bell, and the footman came to remove the tea-things; on which the old birds, having taken leave of Robin, and promiſed to come again the next day, flew out at the window, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by Dicky, Flapſy, and Peckſy. Robin was ſafely depoſited in a cage, and paſſed a happy day, being often allowed to hop out in order to be fed.</p>
               <p>The parent birds alighted in the court, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted their little ones to the water which was ſet out for them, after which they all returned to the neſt; here the young ones reſted till the afternoon, and then their parents took them out in order to ſhew them the orchard.</p>

               <p>YOU have not yet, ſaid the father, ſeen the whole extent of this place, and I wiſh to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce you to our neighbours. He then led the way to a peartree, in which a Linnet had built her neſt. The old Linnets ſeemed much pleaſed to ſee their friends <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Readbreaſts, who with great pride introduced their little family to them. My own neſtlings are juſt ready to fly, ſaid the hen Linnet, and I hope will make acquaintance with them; for birds ſo well inſtructed as, I make no doubt, your offspring are, muſt be very deſirable companions. The little Readbreaſts were quite delighted with the hopes of having ſome agreeable friends; and the old ones replied, that they had themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo much pleaſure from ſocial friendſhip, that they wiſhed their young ones to cultivate the ſame.</p>
               <p>They then flew on to a cherry-tree, in which were a pair of Chaffinches in great agitation, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to part one of their own brood and a young Sparrow, who were engaged in a furious battle; but all in vain, neither of the combatants would deſiſt, till the Chaffinch dropped dead to the ground. His parents were greatly ſhocked at this accident, on which the cock Readbreaſt attempted
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:027817_0129_0FD64EF02DC23008"/>
to comfort them with his ſtrains; but finding them deaf to his muſic, he begged to know the cauſe of the quarrel, which had had ſo fatal a concluſion? O! anſwered the hen Chaffinch, my neſtling is loſt through his own folly. I cautioned him repeatedly not to make acquaintance with Sparrows, knowing they would lead him into miſchief; but no remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance would prevail. As ſoon as he began to peck about, he formed a friendſhip with one of that voracious breed, who undertook to teach him to fly and provide for himſelf; ſo he left his parents and continually followed the Sparrow, who taught him to ſteal corn, and other things, and to quarrel with every bird he met; I expected to ſee him killed continually. At length his companion grew tired of him, and picked a quarrel, which ended as you have ſeen. However, this is better than if he had been caught by men, and hung up, as I have ſeen many a bird, for a ſpectacle, to deter others from ſtealing. Let me adviſe you my young friends, ſaid ſhe, addreſſing herſelf to the little Redbreaſts, to follow your parents directions in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very reſpect, and avoid bad company. She then, accompanied by her mate, flew back to her neſt, in order to acquaint the reſt of her family with this dreadful cataſtrophe, and the Redbreaſts took an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other flight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="unknown:027817_0130_0FD64EF29ADB32C8"/>They alighted on the ground, and began pecking about, when all of a ſudden they heard a ſtrange noiſe, which rather alarmed the young ones. Their father deſired them to have no fears, but follow him; he led them to the top of a high tree, in which was a neſt of Magpies. They had the day before, made an excurſion round the orchard, and were converſing on what they had ſeen, but in ſuch a confuſed manner, that there was no ſuch thing as underſtanding them; one chattered of one thing, and one of another. In ſhort, all were eager to ſpeak, and none inclined to hear.</p>
               <p>What a ſet of fooliſh ill-bred little creatures are theſe, ſaid the cock Redbreaſt; if they would talk one at a time, what each ſays might afford enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to the reſt; but by chattering all together in this manner, they are quite diſagreeable. Take example from them, my neſtlings, and avoid the fault which renders them ſo ridiculous.</p>
               <p>So ſaying, he flew on, and they ſoon ſaw a Cuckow, ſurrounded by a number of birds, who had been pecking at her till ſhe had ſcarce a feather left upon her breaſt, while ſhe kept repeating her own dull note, Cuckow! Cuckow! inceſſantly. Get back again to your own country, ſaid a Thruſh; what buſineſs have you in ours, ſucking the eggs, and taking the neſts of any birds you meet with?
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:027817_0131_0FD64EF5F82DCE30"/>
Surely it would be ſufficient, could you have the privilege of building for yourſelf, as we do who are natives; but you have no right to ſeize upon our labours, and devour our offspring. The Cuckow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves his fate, ſaid the hen Redbreaſt. Though I am far from bearing enmity to foreign birds in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. I deteſt ſuch characters as his. I wonder mankind do not drive Cuckows away; but I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is on account of their being the harbingers of ſummer.</p>
               <p>How different is the character of the Swallow; he comes here to enjoy the mildneſs of the climate, and confers a benefit on the land by deſtroying many noxous inſects. I rejoice to ſee that race ſporting in the air, and have had high pleaſure in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with them; for as they are great travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, they have much to relate. But come let us go on.</p>
               <p>They ſoon came to a hollow tree, peep into this hole, ſaid the cock bird to his young ones, they did ſo, and beheld a neſt of young Owls. What a ſet of ugly creatures, ſaid Dicky; ſurely you do not intend to ſhew your frightful faces to the world! Did ever any one ſee ſuch dull eyes, and ſuch a frightful muffle of feathers?</p>
               <p>Whoever you are that reproach us with a want of beauty, you do not ſhew your own good ſenſe,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:027817_0132_0FD64EF71C0F45F8"/>
replied one of the little Owls. Perhaps we may have qualities which render us as amiable as your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. You do not appear to know that we are Night, and not Day birds. The quantity of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in which we are muffled up, are very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to us when we are out in the cold; and I can ſhew you a pair of eyes, which, if you are little birds, will frighten you out of your wits; and if I could fly, I would let you ſee what elſe I could do. He then drew back the film which was given him, that the ſtrong light of the day might not injure his ſight, and ſtared full at Dicky, who was ſtruck with aſtoniſhment.</p>
               <p>At that inſtant the parent Owl returned, and ſeeing a parcel of ſtrangers looking into her neſt, ſhe ſet up a ſcreeching, which made the whole par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty take wing. As ſoon as they ſtopped to reſt, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> fancy they proved brighter than you expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but had they even been as ugly as you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, it was very ſilly and rude in you to notice it. You ought never to cenſure any bird for natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deformities, ſince no one contracts them by choice; and what appears diſagreeable to you, may
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:027817_0133_0FD64EFA3036B660"/>
be pleaſing in the eyes of another. Beſides, you ſhould be particularly careful not to inſult ſtrangers, becauſe you cannot know their deſerts, nor what power they may have of revenging themſelves. You may think yourſelf happy if you never meet one of theſe Owls by night, for I aſſure you they often feed upon little birds like us; and you have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think they will ſpare you, after the affront you have given them. But come, let us fly on.</p>
               <p>They ſoon alighted on a tree, in which was a Mock-Bird,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Mock-Bird is properly a native of America, but introduced here for the ſake of the moral.</note> who, inſtead of ſinging any note o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> his own, kept ſucceſſively imitating thoſe of every bird that inhabited the orchard, and this with a view of making them ridiculous. If any one had any imperfection in his ſinging, he was ſure to mimic it; or if any was particularly attentive to the duties of his ſtation, he ridiculed him as grave and formal. The young Redbreaſts were exceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diverted with this droll creature: but their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſired them to conſider, whether they ſhould like to hear him mimic them? Every one agreed, that they ſhould be very angry to be ridiculed in that manner. Then, replied the father, neither encourage nor imitate him. The Mock-Bird hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:027817_0134_0FD64EFBF87E72B8"/>
him, took up his notes, "Neither encourage nor imitate him," ſaid he. The cock Redbreaſt on this flew at him with fury plucked ſome feathers from his breaſt, and ſent him ſcreaming from the place. I have made you ſing a Natural note at laſt, ſaid he, and hope you will take care how you prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe Mimickry again. His mate was ſorry to ſee him diſturb his temper, and ruffle his feathers, for ſuch an inſignificant creature; but he told her it was particularly neceſſary as an example to his neſtlings, as Mimickry was a fault to which young birds were too apt to incline; and he wiſhed to ſhew them the danger they expoſed themſelves to in the practice of it.</p>
               <p>The whole Redbreaſt family reſted themſelves for ſome time; and whilſt they ſat ſtill, obſerved a Chaffinch flying from tree to tree, chattering to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very bird he had any knowledge of; and his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſeemed to affect his hearers greatly, for they perceived ſome birds flying off in great haſte, and others meeting them; many battles and diſputes enſued. The little Redbreaſts wondered at theſe circumſtances; at length Peckſy enquired the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the buſtle. This Chaffinch, replied the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a Telltale; it is inconceivable the miſchief he makes. Not that he has ſo much malice in his
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:027817_0135_0FD64F003B2C54A8"/>
nature, but he loves to hear himſelf chatter; and therefore every anecdote he can collect he tells to all he meets, by which means he often raiſes quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and animoſities; neither does he ſtop here, for he frequently invents the tales he relates.</p>
               <p>As the Redbreaſt was ſpeaking, the Chaffinch alighted on the ſame tree. O, my old friend, ſaid he, are you got abroad in the world again? I heard the Linnet in the pear-tree ſay, you were caught ſtealing corn, and hung up as a ſpectacle, but I thought this could not be true; beſides, the Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bird in the cherry-tree told me, that the reaſon we did not ſee you as uſual was, that you were rearing a family, to whom, he ſaid, you were ſo ſevere, that the poor little creatures had no comfort of their lives.</p>
               <p>Whatever you may have heard, or whatever you may ſay, is matter of indifference to me, replied the Redbreaſt; but as a neighbour, I cannot help adviſing you to reſtrain your tongue a little and conſider, before you communicate your intelligence, whether what you are going to ſay has not a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to diſturb the peace of ſociety.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he was thus adviſing him, a flock of birds aſſembled about the tree; it conſiſted of thoſe to whom the Chaffinch had been chattering, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to explanation with each other, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:027817_0136_0FD64F0263E28600"/>
his falſities, and determined to expel him the orchard; which they did, with every mark of contempt and ignominy: all the Redbreaſts joined in the purſuit, for even the little ones ſaw his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in a deteſtable light, and formed a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to avoid his fault. When the tell-tale was gone, the party which purſued him alighted all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the ſame walk, and amongſt them the Redbreaſts diſcovered many of their old friends, with whom they now renewed their acquaintance, knowing they ſhould ſoon be releaſed from family cares; and the young ones paſſed a happy day in this cheerful aſſembly: but at length the hour of repoſe approached, when each individual fled to his reſting-place; and the Redbreaſts, after ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguing a day, fell aſleep.</p>

               <p>In the firſt place, Mrs. Wilſon ſhewed her the houſe, which was in every reſpect very neat, and in compleat order. She then took her gueſt into her dairy, which was well ſtored with milk and cream<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> butter and cheeſe. From hence they went to the
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:027817_0139_0FD64F07295BE7E8"/>
the poultry-yard, where the little Benſons were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively delighted indeed; for there were a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of cocks and hens, and many broods of young chickens, beſides turkies and Guinea hens.</p>
               <p>All the fowls expreſſed the greateſt joy at the ſight of Mrs. Wilſon and her daughter Betſy; the cocks celebrated their arrival by loud crowing; the hens gave notice of their approach by cackling, and aſſembled their infant train to partake of their bounty; the turkies and Guinea fowls ran to meet them; a number of pigeons alſo alighted from a pigeon-houſe. Betſy ſcattered amongſt them the grain which ſhe carried in her lap for that purpoſe, and ſeemed to have great pleaſure in diſtributing it. When their young viſitors were ſatisfied with ſeeing the poultry fed, Mrs. Wilſon ſhewed them the hen-houſe, and other conveniencies provided for them, which were excellently calculated to make their lives comfortable; and then opened a little door, which led to a meadow, where the fowls were often indulged to ramble and refreſh themſelves. On ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her approach this place the whole party col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <pb n="141" facs="unknown:027817_0140_0FD64F0892356468"/>You, Mrs. Wilſon, and your daughter, muſt have great amuſement with theſe pretty creatures, ſaid Mrs. Benſon. We have indeed, Madam, and great profit too; for they furniſh us with a vaſt number of eggs and chickens, not only for our own uſe, but for the market alſo. And can you prevail on yourſelf to kill theſe ſweet creatures? ſaid Miſs Benſon. Indeed, Miſs I cannot, ſaid Mrs. Wilſon, and never did kill a chicken in my life; but it is an eaſy matter to find people capable of doing it; and there is an abſolute neceſſity for ſome of them to die, for they breed ſo faſt, that in a ſhort time we ſhould have more than we could poſſibly feed: but I make it a rule to render their lives as happy as poſſible, and never ſhut them up to fatten any longer than I can help, uſe no cruel methods of cramming them, nor confine them in a ſituation where they can ſee other fowls at liberty; neither do I take the chickens from the hen till ſhe herſelf deſerts them, nor ſet hens upon duck eggs. I often regret, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, that ſo many lives ſhould be ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to preſerve ours; but we muſt eat animals, or they would at length eat us, at leaſt all that would otherwiſe ſupport us.</p>
               <p>Whilſt this converſation paſſed, Maſter Frederick had followed the fowls into the meadow, where the Turkey cock, taking him for an enemy, had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:027817_0141_0FD64F0CDCDDC158"/>
him, and frightened him ſo much, than he cried out for help: Betſy Wilſon ran to his aſſiſtance, and ſoon calmed his fears.</p>
               <p>The farmer's wife next propoſed (but with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny apologies for offering to take them to ſuch a place) to ſhew them her pig-ſties. The name of pig-ſtye generally conveys an idea of naſtineſs, but whoever had ſeen thoſe at Farmer Wilſons, would have had a very different one. They were neatly paved, and waſhed down every day; the troughs in which they fed were frequently ſcoured, and the water they drank was always ſweet and wholeſome. The pigs themſelves had an appearance of neatneſs which no one could have expected in ſuch kind of animals; and though they had not the ingenuity of the learned pig, there was really ſomething in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent in their gruntings, and a very droll arch expreſſion in the eyes of ſome of them. They knew their benefactors, and found means of teſtifying their joy at ſeeing them; which was increaſed when a boy, whom Mrs. Wilſon had ordered to bring ſome bean-ſhells, emptied his baſket before them. Now a conteſt enſued who ſhould have the largeſt ſhare, and each began puſhing the other aſide, and ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing as faſt as he could, leſt they ſhould have more than himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="unknown:027817_0142_0FD64F0ED4A1E7F8"/>Miſs Benſon ſaid ſhe could not bear to ſee ſuch greedineſs. It is indeed, replied Mrs. Benſon, very diſagreeable, even in ſuch creatures as theſe, but how much more ſo in the human ſpecies, and yet how frequent is this fault amongſt children in particular? Pray look at theſe pigs, Frederick, and tell me if you never remember to have met with a little boy who eat ſtrawberries as theſe pigs do bean-ſhells? Frederick's cheeks at this queſtion were covered with conſcious bluſhes; on which his mamma kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kiſſed him, and ſaid, ſhe hoped he had ſeen e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of greedineſs to-day to ſerve him for a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as long as he lived.</p>
               <p>In a ſeparate ſtye was a ſow with a litter of young pigs. This was a very pleaſing ſight indeed to Maſter Frederick, who longed to have one to play with; but Mrs. Wilſon told him it would make the ſow very angry; and her gruntings would ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify him as much as the turkey-cock had done; on which he dropped his requeſt, but ſaid he ſhould like to keep ſuch a little creature.</p>
               <p>If it would always continue little, Frederick, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, it would do very well; but it will perhaps grow as large as its mother, and what ſhall we do then? Familiarized by the kind treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I am ſure you would give it, we ſhould
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:027817_0143_0FD64F152162E000"/>
have it following you into the parlour, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps run grunting after you into your bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. I knew myſelf an inſtance of a perſon who nurſed up a ſuck pig, which actually ran after her to church, and became the moſt troubleſome thing you can conceive.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe your hogs are very profitable as well as your poultry, Mrs. Wilſon? Yes, Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe, we cure a good deal of bacon and pickle a quantity of pork; we ſell a great many ſucking pigs, ſo that we are well paid for keeping them; and I never ſuffer them to be neglected in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and have the pleaſure of thinking, few pigs are happier than mine. But I fear, Ladies, you will be tired with ſtaying here, will it be agreeable to you to take a walk in the garden? With all my heart, ſaid Mrs. Benſon.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wilſon then conducted her gueſts in the garden, which abounded with all kinds of vegita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles for the table, quantities of fruits, and a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of flowers. Maſter Frederick longed to taſte ſome of the delecacies which preſented themſelves to his eye, but he had never been taught to gather fruit or flowers without leave, nor to aſk for any; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Mrs. Wilſon, with his mamma's permiſſion treated him and his ſiſter with ſome fine apples and pears, which Betſy gathered and preſented in cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage

leaves, and then took them to a ſhady arbour, where they ſat and enjoyed their feaſt. After which they went to ſee the bees, who were at work in glaſs hives.</p>

               <p>THIS ſight of the bees was a great entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not only to the children, but to Mrs. Benſon alſo, who was exceſſively pleaſed with the ingenuity and induſtry with which theſe inſects col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected their honey and wax, formed their cells, and depoſited their ſtore. She had, by books, acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a knowledge of the natural hiſtory of bees, which enabled her to examine their work with much greater ſatisfaction, than ſhe would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the ſight of them, had ſhe been only taught to conſider them only as little ſtinging crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whom it was dangerous to approach. This is quite a treat to me indeed, ſaid ſhe to Mrs. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for I never before had an opportunity of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bees at work in glaſs hives. Why, Madam, ſaid the good woman, few will be at the expence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ulging myſelf with them: but I find my account in

keeping bees thus, even upon a principle of oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: for as I do not deſtroy them, I have greater numbers to work for me, and more honey every year than the laſt, notwithſtanding I feed my bees in winter. I have made acquaintance with the queen of every hive, who will come to me whenever I call her, and you ſhall ſee one of their majeſties if you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>On this ſhe called in a manner to which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the hive they were looking at, were accuſtomed to, and a large bee ſoon ſettled on her hand: in an inſtant after ſhe was covered from head to foot with bees. Mrs. Benſon was quite terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leſt they ſhould ſting, and Frederick ran crying away; but Mrs. Wilſon aſſured them that the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle creatures would not do any miſchief, if no one attempted to catch them. Bees are in their natural diſpoſitions very harmleſs creatures, I aſſure you Maſter Benſon, ſaid ſhe; though I own they will certainly ſting little boys who endeavour to catch them in order to ſuck their bag of honey, or take out their ſting; but you ſee that though I have hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds about me, and even on my face and arms, not one offers to do me an injury: and I believe the waſps ſeldom ſting but in their own defence. She then threw up her hand, which the queen bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as a ſignal of dimiſſion, and flew away in great ſtate, ſurrounded by her guards, and followed
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:027817_0146_0FD64F186CBD8978"/>
by the reſt of her ſubjects, each ready to loſe his own life in defence of her's.</p>
               <p>There is ſomething very wonderful, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, in the ſtrong attachment theſe little crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have to their ſovereign, and very inſtructive to. I wiſh our good King could ſee all his ſubjects ſo cloſely united in his intereſt! What ſay you, Frederick, would you fight for King? Yes mamma, if papa would—That I aſſure you, my dear, he certainly would do, if there were occaſion, as loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the beſt Bee in the world; and I beg you will remember what I now tell you as long as you live: That it is your duty to love your King, for he is to be conſidered as the father of his country. But, mamma, ſaid Frederick, it is the Queen that the Bees love, and we have a queen too. Yes, my dear, we have ſo; and I believe her majeſty is as much honoured by her ſubjects as a queen bee in her hive, though ſhe has not ſo full a command over them, for it is a king that governs England as your papa governs his family, and the queen is to be conſidered as the mother of the country. But before we take our leave of the bees, let me obſerve to you, my dears, that ſeveral inſtructive leſſons may be taken from their example. If ſuch little inſects as theſe perform their daily taſks with ſo much alacrity, ſurely it muſt be a ſhame for children to be idle,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:027817_0147_0FD64F1A19208A78"/>
and to fret becauſe they are put to learn things which will be of the utmoſt conſequence to them in the end; and which would indeed conduce to their preſent happineſs, would they but apply to them with a willing mind.</p>
               <p>Science of various kinds preſents itſelf to the human race, as the different flowers offer themſelves to bees; and nothing is wanting to extract the ſweets but an application of thoſe faculties of which they are by nature poſſeſſed. As the induſtrious bee flies ſucceſſively to every fragrant plant within his reach, ſo do you, my dear children, go from one branch of knowledge to another: but obſerve, the bee does not fly giddily from flower to flower, merely to take a tranſient view of its beauties, he reſts on each, till he has obtained all that will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his purpoſe: imitate him in this particular alſo, and be not hurried on, by vain curioſity, from book to book, ſo as to gain only a ſuperficial know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the different parts of your education; but remember, that the bee applies the materials he collects to purpoſes valuable to himſelf, and to the community to which he belongs.</p>
               <p>But come, Mrs. Wilſon, we muſt, if you pleaſe, think of retiring from this place; for if we ſtay here much longer, we ſhall not have time to enjoy the pleaſures you have in reſerve for us. On this Mrs. Wilſon ſaid, ſhe was ready to wait on them</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="unknown:027817_0148_0FD64F1B77B11C50"/>As they walked along, Miſs Benſon took notice of a variety of beautiful inſects, and Frederick ſo far forgot himſelf, as to run after a moth and catch it; but his mamma obliged him to let it go imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. Don't you think, Mrs. Wilſon, ſaid ſhe, that it is very wrong to let children catch butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flies and moths? Indeed, I do, Madam, replied the good woman. Poor little creatures, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury can they do us by <hi>flying about?</hi> In that ſtate at leaſt they are harmleſs to us. Caterpillars and ſnails, it is true, we are frequently obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, on account of their devouring fruit and vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables; but unleſs they abound ſo as to be likely to do a real injury, I never let them be meddled with. I often think of my good father's maxim, which was, "Never to take away the life of any creature, unleſs it was neceſſary for the benefit of mankind." "Whilſt there is food and room enough in the world for them and us, let them live and enjoy the bleſſings they were formed for," he would ſay.</p>
               <p>When I was a little girl, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, I had a great propenſity to catching flies and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, but my father had an excellent microſcope, in which he ſhewed me a number of different ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by this means I learnt, that even the minuteſt creatures might be as ſuſceptible of pain as myſelf; and I declare I cannot put any thing to death, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

fancying I hear its bones crack, and that I ſee its blood guſhing from its veins and arteries; and ſo far from having a pleaſure in killing even the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable inſects which are troubleſome in houſes, I aſſure you I cannot do it myſelf nor ſee it done without pain; and yet they certainly may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as enemies, and an ſuch we have a right to deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>To be ſure, Madam, ſaid Mrs. Wilſon, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cleanlineſs we could not enjoy health. It goes againſt me to demoliſh a fine ſpider's web, and yet they make a houſe look very dirty, but I ſeldom have any in mine, for I took care, when I firſt came to live in it, to deſtroy the neſts, and the old ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, finding there was no ſecurity for their young ones here, have forſaken the houſe; and I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to think, that the ſame vigilance in reſpect to other diſagreeable inſects, would have the ſame effec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Doubtleſs, ſaid Mrs. Benſon; but pray tell me, do you deſtroy the web<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of the garden ſpiders alſo? Not unleſs there are ſo many as to be troubleſome and diſagreeable, replied Mrs. Wilſon. I ſhould not myſelf like to have the fruits of my induſtry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed, nor my little ones taken out of my arms, or from their warm beds, and cruſhed to death. I am of opinion, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, that it would be a good way to accuſtom one's ſelf, before one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For inſtance, if I accidentally diſturb an ant's neſt, inſtead of cruſhing the little creatures with thoughtleſs inhumanity, as a ſet of inſignificant atoms, I can fancy them appearing to me of the ſame magnitude a microſcope would ſhew them, and one of them addreſſing me in this manner:— "Step aſide, I entreat you, and let me and my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates paſs in ſafety, that we may repair the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief you have done to our city.

<pb n="152" facs="unknown:027817_0151_0FD64F1F9AD3EB80"/>
rather ye, whoſe hearts are alive to the ſentiments of humanity, plead our cauſe to the thoughtleſs part of your own ſpecies, and as lords of the creation, drive away from us thoſe natural enemies, which you may ſee darting down to devour us! if you love your own offspring think of ours; if you would be proſperous in your own occupations, protect thoſe who afford a leſſon of induſtry, which the wiſeſt of mankind has recommended to your ſerious conſideration.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Madam, ſaid Mrs. Wilſon, I have often wiſhed that poor dumb creatures had ſomebody to ſpeak for them; many an innocent life would then be ſaved, which is now deſtroyed to no end.</p>
               <p>Well, ſaid Harriet, I am ſure I ſhall never kill any thing, without firſt magnifying it in my mind, and thinking what it would ſay for itſelf if able to ſpeak. Then, my dear, I will engage for you, replied her mamma, that you will put but very few creatures to death: but in order to have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per notion of their form, and to be capable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king theſe ideal ſpeeches, you muſt ſtudy Natural Hiſtory; from whence you will learn, how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful their conſtruction is; how carefully and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly the inferior creatures provide for their young; how ingenious their various employments are; how far they are from harbouring malice againſt the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpecies; and how excellently they are inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:027817_0152_0FD64F23EEA8FA10"/>
and inſtructed by their great Creator, for the enjoyment of happineſs in their different claſſes of exiſtence, which happineſs we have certainly no right wantonly to diſturb. Beſides, it is really a meanneſs to deſtroy any creature merely becauſe it is <hi>little</hi>; and in children, particularly abſurd to do ſo; for upon this principle, they muſt themſelves expect to be conſtantly ill-treated: though no ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſtands more in need of tenderneſs than they do for many years, from the time of their coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world; and even men and women might expect to be <hi>annihilated,</hi> by the power of the great CREATOR.</p>
               <p>Neither do I know how we can preciſely call any thing <hi>great or little,</hi> ſince it is only ſo by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with others. An ant or fly may appear to one of its own ſpecies, whoſe eyes are formed to ſee thoſe parts which we cannot diſcover without glaſſes, as conſiderable as men and women do to each other: and to creatures of the dimenſions of a mite, one the ſize of an ant doubtleſs looks formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable and gigantic. I therefore think that it is but juſtice to view inſects with microſcopic eyes, before we commit cruel devaſtations among them.</p>
               <p>During this converſation Maſter Frederick kept running about making choice of flowers, which Betſy Wilſon gathered and formed into noſegays for his mamma, and himſelf.</p>

               <p>THE next place Mrs. Wilſon took her gueſts to was a farm-yard, in which was a large horſe-pond. Here her young viſitors were delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the appearance of a number of geeſe and ducks; ſome were ſwimming in the water, ſome diving, and others rooting in the mud to ſee what fiſh or worms they could find.</p>
               <p>It appears ſtrange to me, ſaid Miſs Benſon, that any creatures can take delight in making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo dirty; and yet, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, how many children do the ſame, without having any excuſe for it? The ducks and geeſe grub about ſo in ſearch of the neceſſaries of life; but I have ſeen boys do it merely for diverſion, and ſometimes at the hazard of their lives.</p>
               <p>Very true, Madam, ſaid Mrs. Wilſon; my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Neddy had like to have been drowned, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ago than laſt Monday. He is a little venture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome rogue, and runs through thick and thin when pleaſure is in view; but I fancy he will not hunt ducks about any more: for my part, I do not like any of my children ſhould make ſport of teazing animals. I wiſh every creature I keep to enjoy happineſs to the day of its death, and when it muſt

be killed, to have it diſpatched by the quickeſt means poſſible.</p>
               <p>Have you any fiſh here? ſaid Frederick. I believe none of any conſequence, Sir; the ducks and geeſe would take care that none ſhould grow to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſize; but there are plenty in a pond which you will ſee in the next field, and I hope to have the pleaſure of ſeeing you, at dinner eat of ſome perch which were caught there. Sometimes we catch fine carp and tench, but only with nets; for neither my good man nor I can bear the cruel diverſion of angling; nor do we allow our children to follow it from a notion that it hardens the heart, and leads to idleneſs.</p>
               <p>Pray, mamma, ſaid Miſs Harriet, is it right to catch fiſh? I ſhould think, as they live in water, and we upon land, we have no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſineſs with them. You would wiſh every one then, my dear, to keep to their own element? Your ſentiment is a good one in many reſpects, but it muſt not be extended ſo far as to forbid the catching of fiſh. Man has dominion over fiſh, as well as over beaſts and fowls, and many of them are excellent food for mankind; and the aſtoniſhing increaſe of them ſhews that they are deſigned to be ſo; for were all that are ſpawned to grow to full ſize, there would ſoon be more than our ponds, or even than the ſea itſelf would hold, and they would be ſtarved; therefore there are the
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:027817_0155_0FD64F2965CC54A0"/>
ſame reaſons for our feeding on them as on poultry, but we ſhould be very careful to diſpatch them as quickly as poſſible.</p>
               <p>Some people are cruel enough to roaſt lobſters alive, whoſe cries I have been told are dreadful to hear; and others will flay eels alive, then put them without their ſkins into a pail of cold water, and afterwards cut them in pieces, and throw them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a frying-pan of boiling fat, where ſometimes every ſeparate piece will wreath about in agony. Thus each poor fiſh ſuffers as many deaths as it is divided into pieces. Now, Harriet, this cannot be right, however authorized by cuſtom; therefore I hope you will never ſuffer ſuch things to be done in your kitchen when you keep houſe, but always give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that your lobſters be put into boiling water, which kills them ſoon, and that your eels are knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the head before they are ſkinned. This is dreadful enough, though little in compariſon of what they ſuffer by the other methods.</p>
               <p>Oh! mamma, ſaid Harriet, you make me even ſhudder; I do not believe I ſhall ever deſire to eat eels; I ſhall be ready to make ſpeeches for every piece as it lies in a diſh before me. But pray tell me, is it cruel to kill frogs and toads? Aſk Mrs. Wilſon, my dear, ſhe has more to do with ſuch reptiles than I have. Why, Miſs, replied Mrs. Wilſon, I am very ſingular in regard to ſuch kind
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:027817_0156_0FD64F31301981D0"/>
of creatures; and though I by no means like to have them in my houſe, I do not make an outcry, and condemn every one to a violent death which is accidentally found in my cellars, or other places; on the contrary, I generally ſee it thrown into a ditch at ſome diſtance to take its chance. There are many birds and water-fowl that feed on young frogs and toads, which will in general keep them from multiplying, ſo as to be nuiſances to us; and it is time enough for us to take arms againſt them, if there happens to be a very extraordinary increaſe of them. My good man is as particular in reſpect to moles; if he finds them in his garden, or any other part of his grounds where they can do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, he has them killed, but never ſuffers them to be moleſted when they are harmleſs. Neither does he hunt, or permit any one belonging to him to hunt after ſnakes; for he ſays, that if they are not diſturbed, they will not come from their haunts to annoy us; and to kill, for the ſake of killing, is cruel.</p>
               <p>Pray, Mrs. Wilſon, ſaid Frederick, do your ſons ever go a birds neſting? They had better not let me know it, if they do, ſaid ſhe. No, Sir, I hope I have not a child amongſt my family capable of ſuch barbarity. In the courſe of the ſummer they generally have young birds to nurſe, who fall out of the neſt, or loſe their parents, but are ſeldom
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:027817_0157_0FD64F32609D8490"/>
lucky enough to raiſe them; and we have only one in a cage which they reared laſt ſummer. Yet we have plenty of ſinging; for the ſweet creatures, finding they may enjoy themſelves unmoleſted in the trees, treat us with their harmony from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to night, of which you had a ſpecimen in the garden. Sparrows, indeed, my huſband is under the neceſſity of deſtroying, for they are ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers, they would leave him but little corn to carry to market if he did not ſhoot them; but he never kills the Crows, becauſe they are very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in picking up grubs, and other things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to farmers: we only ſet a little boy to watch our new-ſown grain, who keeps making a noiſe, which effectually frightens them. O! ſaid Frederick, I nurſe young birds too. I have got a Linnet and a Robin Redbreaſt, and feed an hundred beſide.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wilſon ſmiled, and turning away to Mrs. Benſon, ſaid, Now, Madam, we will, if you pleaſe, return to the houſe, for I fancy by this time dinner is nearly ready, and my huſband and ſons are about coming home.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Benſon was a little tired with her ramble, and was really impatient to ſee Farmer Wilſon and the reſt of his amiable family. When ſhe drew near the houſe ſhe was met by the worthy man, who gave her a moſt cordial welcome, and ſaid he
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:027817_0158_0FD64F33DB1E98B0"/>
was proud to ſee ſo much good company. Nancy, the eldeſt daughter, to whom the mother had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted the care of inſpecting the additional cooke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which ſhe had ordered, and who for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was not to be ſeen in the morning, now made her appearance, dreſſed with the moſt perfect neatneſs; health blooming in her cheeks, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and good humour ſparkled in her eyes. With this engaging countenance ſhe eaſily prevailed on Maſter Frederick to let her place him by her on the table, round which the two other viſitors, and the maſter and miſtreſs of the houſe, and the reſt of their offspring, conſiſting of Thomas, a fine youth of eighteen, four younger boys, and little Betſy, were ſoon ſeated.</p>
               <p>The table was covered with plain food, but by the good management of Nancy, who had made an excellent pudding, an apple-pye and ſome delicious cuſtards, it made a very good figure; and Mrs. Benſon often afterwards declared, that ſhe never enjoyed an entertainment ſo much. It was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably heightened by the happy countenances of the whole family. The father who was a jocoſe man ſaid a number of droll things, which diverted his little viſitors very much, and ſoon after dinner he begged leave to depart, as he was ſheep-ſhearing; but ſaid, he thought the young gentlefolks might
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:027817_0159_0FD64F370594D540"/>
be diverted with the ſight, ſo invited them to pay him a viſit in the field, and left Joe and Neddy to conduct Maſter Frederick.</p>

            <div n="20" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XX.</head>
               <p>THE young farmers were rather ſhy at firſt, being afraid their gueſts would laugh at their country talk; but when they obſerved how politely they behaved to their ſiſters, they entered into converſation, and told Maſter Benſon an hundred particulars about animals, with which he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unacquainted; and he in return told them all he knew about the Redbreaſts and other penſioners. They then ſhewed him a pretty cat with kittens, and a bitch with two young puppies; the latter were kept in a kennel, and the cat in a ſtable where they were well ſupplied with food. As Frederick knew that his ſiſter was remarkably fond of cats, he ſtepped back to call her to look at theſe, which with her mamma's permiſſion, ſhe was greatly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to do, and longed to have the kittens to nurſe. When ſhe returned, ſhe enquired whether the dogs
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:027817_0160_0FD64F395A388258"/>
and cats were ever permitted to come into the houſe? Not whilſt they have young ones, ſaid Mrs. Wilſon, for they make a great deal of dirt and are very troubleſome at that time; but when puſs has brought up her family, which is deſigned for the ſtable, ſhe ſhall be admitted amongſt us again; for ſhe is a very uſeful creature, and deſerves to be well treated, but I do not ſuffer my children to handle her; I think it looks very ugly for any one to be all over ſcratches. Daphne is admitted to a greater ſhare of familiarity; ſhe is very faithful, and extremely good-natured, but we never feed her in the houſe, for there is no doing ſo without greaſing the floors.</p>
               <p>I am of opinion, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, that a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſhould be made between our treatment of cats and dogs. There is ſomething very ſavage in the nature of the former; and though they certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are deſerving of our kindneſs on account of their uſefulneſs, yet they cannot make themſelves ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable as dogs. There is ſomething really very formidable in their talons and teeth; and when enraged, a cat is no better than a little tygreſs. Beſides, where there not danger to one's ſelf nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:027817_0161_0FD64F395DBADED0"/>
cats, there is no doing it without injury to one's linen; for when puſs is beſt pleaſed, ſhe generally tramples with her talons unſheathed, by which practice many a nice apron has been torn. And even the cleanlineſs of cats is injurious, for they uſually have recourſe to corners of chairs, in order to rub the dirt from their talons. Many people have a great dread of this animal, and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it ſhould not be uſed to come into rooms in which a variety of company is received.</p>
               <p>As for dogs, they are in general ſo very ſociable, grateful and pleaſing, that they ſeem formed to be the humble companions of mankind; and if kept in proper order, may be familiarized with ſafety; but then they ſhould be well educated and taught to know their diſtance. And as there are different ſpecies of them, we ſhould make a prudent ſelecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not introduce into the houſe great maſtiffs or tall grey hounds; neither muſt we indulge thoſe we domeſticate to too great a degree, for in that caſe they will become as troubleſome as cats.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Benſon now expreſſed her deſire to ſee the ſheep-ſhearing; on which Mrs. Wilſon and her daughter conducted her and Miſs Harriet to the field, where they arrived at the concluſion of the
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:027817_0162_0FD64F3A9A96BB70"/>
operation; and a very pleaſing fight it was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold theſe happy creatures, who lately waddled under a heavy, heating load, relieved from their burthen, leaping and friſking with delight, whilſt the accumulated wool ſeemed, as it lay, to promiſe comfortable cloathing for many a naked wretch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the human ſpecies, who, deſtitute of ſuch a ſupply would be in danger of periſhing with cold in the enſuing winter. Miſs Harriet obſerved the innocent countenances of the ſheep and lambs, and ſaid ſhe thought it was a thouſand pities to kill them. It is ſo, my dear, ſaid her mamma, but we muſt not always indulge our feelings too far in reſpect to animals which are given us for food; all we have to do is to avoid barbarity. It is happy for them that they have no apprehenſion of being killed, and therefore enjoy life in peace and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the very laſt; and when the knife is lifted to their throats, are ignorant of its deſtination: and when the fatal blow is once ſtruck, a few ſtruggles put an end to their pain for ever. But come, Mrs. Wilſon, will you favour us with a ſight of your cows. With pleaſure, Madam, they are by this time driven up to be milked. She then conducted her viſitors towards the farm-yard.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="unknown:027817_0163_0FD64F3EC8AE36B8"/>Perhaps, Madam, ſaid Mrs. Wilſon, as they walked along, the young Lady and Gentleman may be afraid of horned cattle? I believe, replied Mrs· Benſon, I may venture to ſay, that Harriet has no unreaſonable fears of any living creature; it has been my endeavour to guard the minds of my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren againſt ſo diſtreſſing a weakneſs; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Frederick's heart has acquired fortitude enough to enable him to venture near ſo many cows, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell. O yes, mamma, cried Frederick, I would ſooner get up and ride into the farm-yard on the horns of one of them, than run away. Well, we ſhall ſoon put your courage to the proof, ſaid Mrs. Benſon; ſo come along, Sir.</p>
               <p>As for my children, ſaid Mrs. Wilſon, they are remarkably courageous in reſpect to animals; all the creatures belonging to us are very harmleſs and gentle, which is the natural conſequence of kind treatment, and no perſon need be afraid of walking in any part of our grounds: but it is difficult to perſuade ſome people that there is no danger, for they are apt to imagine, that every looſe horſe they ſee will gallop over them, and that every creature with horns will gore and toſs them. Very true, replied Mrs. Benſon; and I have known many as much afraid of a toad, a frog, or a ſpider, as if certain death would be the conſequence of meeting
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:027817_0164_0FD64F43BA6DC768"/>
them; when if theſe perſons would but make uſe of their reaſon, they would ſoon be convinced that ſuch fears are ill-grounded. Frogs and toads are very harmleſs creatures, and ſo far from offering an injury to any human being they may chance to meet, hop away with all poſſible expedition, from a dread of being themſelves deſtroyed; and the ſpiders drop ſuddenly down, with a view of their own preſervation only; and therefore it is highly ridiculous to be afraid of them. Horſes and oxen are much more formidable creatures; they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly could do us a great deal of miſchief, if they were conſcious of their own ſuperior ſtrength; but Providence has wiſely ordained that they ſhould not be ſo; and having given mankind dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, has inplanted in their nature an awe and dread of the human ſpecies, which occaſion them to yield ſubjection to the Lords of the creation, when they exert their authority in a proper man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It is really a very wonderful thing, Mrs. Wilſon, to ſee a fine lively horſe ſubmitting to the bit and harneſs, or a drove of oxen quietly march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the direction of one man!</p>
               <p>Pray, mamma, ſaid Harriet, what do you mean by ſaying, that man is LORD of the <hi>Creation?</hi> Are all brutes ſubject to every man? I cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how this can be. I will endeavour to explain
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:027817_0165_0FD64F44B707B138"/>
it to you, my dear, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, the next time we read the Bible toget<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er; at preſent, I have only time to inform you, that the dread of mankind, which pervails ſo generally amongſt the inferior creatures, does not exiſt in ſo high a degree as to render every <hi>individual</hi> animal afraid of every <hi>individual</hi> man; but the human ſpecies, that is to ſay all mankind together, have an undoubted ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority and dominion: and there is no ſpecies of animals which if collected together, mankind could not ſubdue; for though inferior to many of them in ſtrength, men vaſtly exceed them in number, and having the uſe of <hi>reaſon,</hi> can employ a variety of means to conquer them: and I make no doubt, but was the experiment poſſible, to aſſemble each indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual ſpecies, in oppoſition to the <hi>whole race of mankind,</hi> which exiſt at one time upon the earth, or even an unequal number of them, the dread and fear which is inſtinctive in their natures, would operate ſo powerfully on the hearts of the moſt fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocious of them, as to prevent their attempting any conteſt.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable, and ſhews at once the goodneſs and wiſdom of our great CREATOR, that thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which are the moſt uſeful to us, are the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt tamed; and yield, not only ſingly, but in flocks, to mankind, nay even to boys.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="unknown:027817_0166_0FD64F45DDB915C8"/>From what I have ſaid you muſt perceive that it is a great weakneſs for a human being to be afraid of <hi>animals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this time the party were advanced pretty near to the farm-yard, and Frederick eſpied one of the cows peeping over the gate; on which with a countenance expreſſive of fear, he haſtily ran to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his mamma and aſked her, whether cows could toſs people over gates and hedges? I will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſo ſilly a queſtion, Frederick, ſaid ſhe; pray look again, and you will percieve that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for ſuch large heavy creatures to do ſo; and theſe incloſures are made on purpoſe to confine them within proper bounds. But did not you boaſt juſt now, that you could ride on the horns of one of them? That I ſhall not require you to do, for it would very likely make the creature angry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe cows are not accuſtomed to carry any loads upon their heads; neither would I allow you to run after them with a ſtick, or to make any attempt to frighten them; but if you approach as a friend, I make no doubt you will be received as ſuch; ſo ſummon your courage and attend us, the cows will not hurt you, I can aſſure you.</p>
               <p>Neddy Wilſon then began laughing from the idea that a boy ſhould be afraid of a cow! which made Frederick aſhamed of himſelf; and quitting his
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:027817_0167_0FD64F48EB3510D0"/>
mamma's gown, by which he had held faſt whilſt ſhe was ſpeaking, he laid hold of Neddy's hand, and declared his reſolution to go as near the cows as he would. I will not take upon me to ſay, that his little heart was perfectly free from palpitation; but that lay in his own boſom, where none could diſcover its feelings but himſelf; ſo let us give him credit for as much courage as we can, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be a noble little fellow, in thus truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf amongſt a number of horned cattle.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXI.</head>
               <p>THE whole party now entered the farm-yard, where they ſaw eight fine cows, fat, ſleek, and beautifully clean, who yielded ſeveral pails of rich milk, the ſteam of which, added to the breath of the cows, caſt a delightful fragrance around. Mrs. Wilſon then entreated her company to return to the houſe, where tea was provided, and a delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſyllabub.</p>
               <p>The farmer now came back, and refreſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a cup of ale, which was very comfortable after the fatigues of the day.</p>
               <p>I have had, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, great pleaſure in viewing your farm, Mr. Wilſon, which appears to
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:027817_0168_0FD64F4A8E3C7860"/>
me to afford all the deſirable comforts and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies of life, and I moſt ſincerely wiſh a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of your proſperity. If it is not an impertinent queſtion, pray tell me, did you inherit it from your father, or was it purchaſed with the fruits of your own induſtry?</p>
               <p>Neither my wife nor I have led an idle life, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, Madam, replied the farmer; but, next to the bleſſing of heaven, I think myſelf in a great degree indebted to my cattle for my good ſucceſs. My father left me maſter of a little farm, with a few acres of land well cropped, three horſes, two cows, ſix ſheep, a ſow and pigs a jack-aſs, and a few poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; theſe have gradually multiplied to what you now ſee me poſſeſs, beſides numbers that I have ſold, and I have had fine crops of hay and corn: ſo that every year I laid by a little money, till I was able to purchaſe this farm, which is as good a one as any man ſhould deſire.</p>
               <p>There is ſomething ſo uncommon in hearing a farmer attribute part of his ſucceſs in life to his cattle, that I ſhould be obliged to you, Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſaid the Lady, if you would account to me for this circumſtance. Moſt readily, Madam, ſaid he.</p>
               <p>When I was a very young man, I heard a fine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon from the pulpit, preached by my dear wife's father, on the ſubject of ſhewing mercy to brutes.
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:027817_0169_0FD64F4DA49ED120"/>
which made a great impreſſion on my mind; and I have ever ſince acted towards all dumb creatures, as I would to mankind, upon the principle of doing as I would be done by. I always conſider every beaſt that works for me as my ſervant, and entitled to wages; but as the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> cannot uſe money, I pay them in things of more value to them; and make it a rule, except in caſes of great neceſſity, (when corn or hay, for inſtance, is likely to be ſpoiled) to let them enjoy reſt on the Sabbath-day. I am very cautious of not letting any beaſt work beyond its ſtrength, and always give them their food in due ſeaſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; nor do I ever ſuffer them to be beat or cruelly uſed. Beſides giving them what I call their daily wages, I indulge them with all the comforts I can afford them. In ſummer, when the buſineſs of the day is over, my horſes enjoy themſelves in good paſture; and in winter they are ſheltered from the inclemencies of the weather in a warm ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If they get old, I contrive ſome eaſy taſk for them; and when they can work no longer, let them live without it, till age and infirmities make their lives burthenſome to themſelves, when I have them put to as eaſy a death as poſſible. Though my cows and ſheep do not work for me, I think them entitled to recompence for the profit I receive from their milk and wool, and endeavour to repay them by the kindeſt uſage: and even my jack-aſs finds
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:027817_0170_0FD64F52A29370C0"/>
mercy from me; for I could not bear to ſee ſuch a uſeful creature ill treated; and as for my dogs, I ſet great ſtore by them on account of their fidelity.</p>
               <p>Theſe are very excellent rules indeed, Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and I wiſh they were generally followed; for I believe many beaſts ſuffer a great deal from the ill-treatment inflicted on them, the horſes in poſt-chaiſes and hackney-coaches in London particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Yes, Madam, ſaid the farmer, I have heard ſo and could tell you ſuch ſtories of cruelties exerciſed on brutes in the country, as would quite ſhock you: and have ſeen in my own family ſuch an inſtance of the ill-effects of neglecting them, as has confirmed me in the notions I learnt from the good ſermon I told you of.</p>
               <p>I have a brother, whom I at preſent maintain; my father gave him an equal portion with myſelf, but neither he nor his wife were induſtrious, nor had they any feeling for dumb creatures. He truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the care of his horſes to his plough-boys, who uſed to ride them about, let them go without water, and frequently neglect both to feed and clean them; and indeed, he himſelf grudged their victuals; ſo they grew leaner and leaner, and at laſt were real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly killed with hard work and hard living. His cows were kept ſo badly in the winter, that they ſoon loſt their milk; and he calves they had, for
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:027817_0171_0FD64F52A7E512E0"/>
want of proper management, died; as did the cows themſelves in a ſhort time afterwards. The ſheep got a diſtemper, which ſoon put an end to them. His pigs being kept in the moſt dirty way in the world, and ſometimes without food for two days together, got hide-bound and full of vermin; and his poultry dropped off with the roup and other diſorders, till he had none left. The jack-aſs uſed to be put to hard drudgery in his own ſervice, or let out to draw a ſand-cart: this exceſſive labour, with ſcarcely time allowed him to ſeek a ſcanty living amongſt thiſtles and hedges, ſoon put an end to him. Theſe loſſes my brother had no means to repair, for without cattle he could not cultivate his farm and was ſoon reduced to poverty; and were I not to maintain him, he muſt be a beggar; for thro' want of air and exerciſe he loſt his health, and is now incapable of working. His wife died ſome years before of an illneſs, which was the conſequence of indolence and inactivity.</p>
               <p>I am much obliged to you for your ſtory, Mr. Wilſon, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, and hope my children will never forget it; for it certainly is a duty to extend our clemency to beaſts and other animals. Nay, we are ſtrictly commanded in the ſcriptures to ſhew compaſſion to the beaſts of others, even to thoſe of our enemies: ſurely, then, thoſe which are our own property, and work for us, have a
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:027817_0172_0FD64F541E752268"/>
particular claim to it. There is one cuſtom which ſhocks me very much, and that is pounding the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; I fancy, Mr. Wilſon, you do not practiſe that much? Why, Madam, replied he, I ſhould much rather pound the owners of them, through whoſe neglect or diſhoneſty it generally happens that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes treſpaſs on other people's land. If any beaſt accidentally gets into my grounds, I ſend it home to its owner, for it certainly is no wilful fault in the creature to ſeek the beſt paſture it can find; but if I have reaſon to ſuppoſe his owner turned him in, I then think myſelf obliged to do what the law directs in that reſpect: but though it is a ſecret I am obliged to keep from my neighbours, I may ſafely confeſs to you, Madam, that I have not the heart to let a poor beaſt ſtarve in a pound. As there are no Courts of Juſtice in which they can ſeek redreſs, I erect one for them in my own breaſt, where humanity pleads their cauſe. I wiſh they had ſuch an advocate in every breaſt, Mr. Wilſon, ſaid the Lady: but my watch reminds me that we muſt now take our leave, which I do with many thanks to you and Mrs. Wilſon, for your kind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment and good cheer, and ſhall be happy to return your civilities at my own houſe, and pray bring your whole family with you.</p>
               <p>She then deſired her ſon and daughter to prepare
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:027817_0173_0FD64F560E18A480"/>
for their departure. Frederick was grown ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate with little Neddy, that he could ſcarcely be prevailed on to leave him, till he recollected Robin and the Linnet.</p>
               <p>As they returned in the coach, Mrs. Benſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that Farmer Wilſon's ſtory was enough to make every one who heard it careful of their live ſtock for their own ſakes; but, ſaid ſhe, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and advantage will be greatly increaſed, if it is done from a principle of humanity as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. Miſs Benſon anſwered, that ſhe hoped ſhe ſhould neither treat animals ill, nor place her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on them too ſtrongly. That, my dear, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied her good mamma, is the proper medium to be obſerved. The ſpeech you made for the ant, mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, ſaid Harriet, has ſcarcely ever been out of my head ſince: I ſhould like to hear what you could ſay for every live creature we ſee. I had need have ſtrong lungs, my dear, to perform ſuch a taſk as that, replied Mrs. Benſon. I ſhall, on all proper occaſions, be ready to lend my tongue to the dumb, and to ſpeak for thoſe who cannot utter their own ſorrows and injuries.</p>
               <p>In a ſhort time they arrived at home. The maid, to whoſe care the birds have been entruſted, gave a good account of her charge; and Miſs Harriet and Maſter Frederick went to bed in peace, after
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:027817_0174_0FD64F57276163F0"/>
a day ſpent with ſo much pleaſure and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>THE next morning the Redbreaſts attended as uſual, and Robin was ſtill better, but his father began to fear he would never perfectly recover from his accident; however, he kept his apprehenſions to himſelf, and ſuffered the little ones to entertain their lame brother with a relation of what they had ſeen the day before in the orchard. Frederick and Harriet were ſo diverted with the chattering and chirping of the little things, that they did not miſs the parents ſong. When the young ones had ſtaid as long as ſhe thought right, the hen-Redbreaſt ſummoned them away, and all took leave of Robin, who longed to go with them, but was not able. The father reminded him, that he had great reaſon to rejoice in his preſent ſituation, conſidering all things; on which he reſumed his cheerfulneſs, and giving a ſprightly twitter, hopped into Maſter Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick's hand, which was ſpread open to receive him. The reſt then flew away, and Miſs Harriet and her brother prepared for their morning taſk.</p>
               <p>The Redbreaſts alighted as uſual to drink in the court yard, and were preparing to return to the
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:027817_0175_0FD64F5EA5FC1F00"/>
orchard, when Flapſy expreſſed a deſire to ſee a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle about the world; for ſhe ſaid it would be very mopiſh to be always confined to the orchard, and Dicky ſeconded her requeſt. Peckſy replied, that however her curioſity might be excited, ſhe had known ſo much happineſs in the neſt, that ſhe was ſtrongly attached to the paternal ſpot, and could gladly paſs her life there. The parents both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended her contented diſpoſition; but her father ſaid, that there was nothing blamable in the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Dicky and Flapſy diſcovered for ſeeing the world, provided it was kept within due bounds, he would readily gratify it: then aſking if they were ſufficiently refreſhed, took wing, and led the way to the neighbouring grove, where he placed his little tribe amongſt the branches of a venerable oak.</p>
               <p>Here their ears were charmed with a moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting concert of muſic. On one tree a Black-bird and a Thruſh poured forth their ſtrong melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious notes; on another a number of Linnets joined their ſweet voices: exalted in the air, a Sky-Lark modulated his delightful pipe; whilſt a brother of the wood, feated on a cool-refreſhing turf, made the grove re-echo with his melody; to theſe the Nightingale joined his enchanting lay. In ſhort, not a note was wanting to complete the harmony.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="unknown:027817_0176_0FD64F6075295C18"/>The little Redbreaſts were ſo exceedingly charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that for a while they continued liſtening with ſilent rapture; at length, Dicky exclaimed, how happy ſhould I be to join the cheerful band, and live for ever in this charming place! It is, replied his mother, a very pleaſant ſituation, to be ſure; but could you be ſenſible of the ſuperior advantages, which as a Redbreaſt, you may enjoy by taking up your abode in the orchard, you would never wiſh to change it; for my own part, I find myſelf ſo happy in that calm retreat, that nothing but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ſhall ever drive me from it. Peckſy declared that though ſhe was much delighted with the novelty of the ſcene, and charmed with the muſic, ſhe now felt an ardent deſire to return home; but Flapſy wiſhed to ſee a little more firſt.</p>
               <p>Well, ſaid the father, your deſire ſhall be grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; let us take a circuit in this grove, for I wiſh you to ſee every thing worth obſervation in every place you go to; and not to fly about the world, as many giddy birds do without the leaſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from their travels. On this he ſpread his wings as the ſignal of departure, which his family obeyed.</p>
               <p>Obſerving a parcel of boys creeping ſilently along, ſtop, ſaid he, let us perch on this tree, and ſee what theſe little Monſters are about. Scarcely were they ſeated, when one of the boys mounted an adjacent
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:027817_0177_0FD64F61C560E848"/>
tree, and took a neſt of half-fledged Linnets, which he brought in triumph to his companions.</p>
               <p>At this inſtant, a family of thruſhes unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chirped, which directed another boy to the place of their habitation; on which he climbed, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly ſiezed the little unfortunate creatures. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving met with ſo much ſucceſs, they left the grove to exult, at their own homes, over their wretched captives, for ever ſeparated from their tender pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; who ſoon came back, laden with the gain of their labour, which they had kindly deſtined for the ſuſtenance of their infant broods.</p>
               <p>The little Redbreaſts were now ſpectators of thoſe parental agonies which had been formerly deſcribed to them; and Peckſey cried out, Who would deſire to live in this grove, who had once experienced the comforts of the orchard? Dicky and Flapſy were deſirous to depart, being alarmed for their own ſafety. No, ſaid the father, let us ſtay a little longer—now we will go on. They accordingly took another flight, and ſaw a man ſcattering ſeed upon the ground. See there, ſaid Dicky, what fine food that man throws down; I dare ſay he is ſome good creature who is a friend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="179" facs="unknown:027817_0178_0FD64F6351AD8728"/>
the little ones ſtretched out their necks, and kept a curious eye fixed on the man. In a few minutes, a number of Sparrows, Chaffinches, and Linnets deſcended, and began to regale themſelves; but in the midſt of the feaſt, a net was ſuddenly caſt over them, and they were all taken captive. The man, who was a bird catcher by profeſſion, called to his aſſiſtant, who brought a cage divided into a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſmall partitions, in which the Linnets and Chaffinches were ſeparately depoſited. In this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal priſon, where they had ſcarcely room to flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were thoſe little creatures confined who lately poured forth their ſongs of joy, fearleſs of danger. As for the Sparrows, their necks were wrung, and they were put in a bag together. The little Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaſts trembled for themſelves, and were in great haſte to take wing. Stay, ſaid the father, Dicky has not yet made acquaintance with this friend of the feathered race. No, ſaid Dicky, nor do I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it; defend me, and all who are dear to me, from ſuch friends as theſe! Well, ſaid the father, learn from this inſtance, never to form an haſty judgment, nor to put yourſelf into the power of ſtrangers, who offer you favours you have no right to expect from their hands.</p>
               <p>Indeed, my love, ſaid the mother bird, I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry auxious to get home; I have not lately been uſed to be long abſent from it, and every excurſion I
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:027817_0179_0FD64F652165BA78"/>
make endears it to me. O, the day is not half ſpent, replied her mate; and I hope, for the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the little ones, you will conſent to compleat the ramble. Come let us viſit another part of the grove; I am acquainted with its inmoſt receſſes. His mate acquieſced, and they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their journey.</p>
               <p>At length, the father haſtily called out, Turn this way! turn this way! The whole party obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the word of command, and found the good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of their obedience; for in an inſtant they ſaw a flaſh of fire, a thick ſmoke followed it, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The little Redbreaſts were ſtruck with conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at this dreadful accident; and Peckſy, who recovered the ſooneſt, begged her father would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her by what means the Redſtart was killed. He was ſhot to death, ſaid he; and had you not followed my directions, it might have been the fate of every one of you: therefore, let it be a leſſon to you, to follow every injunction of your parents with the ſame readineſs for the future. You may
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:027817_0180_0FD64F666427C878"/>
depend upon it, our experience teaches us to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee many dangers, which ſuch young creatures as you have no notion of; and when we deſire you to do, or forbear any thing, it is for the ſake of your ſafety or advantage; therefore, Dicky, never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtand enquiring, as you ſometimes have done, and aſking, Why we tell you to do ſo and ſo? For had that been the caſe now, you, who were in a direct line with the gunner, would have been inevitably ſhot.</p>
               <p>They all ſaid they would obſerve implicit obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Do ſo, ſaid he; but in order to do this, you muſt alſo remember to practice, in our abſence, what we enjoin you when preſent. For inſtance, ſome kinds of food are very prejudicial to your health, which we would not on any account, let you taſte when we are by: theſe you muſt not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge in when away from us, whatever any bird may ſay in recommendation of them. Neither muſt you engage in any dangerous enterprize, which others, who have natural ſtrength or acquired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gility, go through with ſafety; nor ſhould you go to any places which we have pointed out as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, nor join any company which we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid you to make acquaintance with. This poor Redſtart might have avoided his fate; for I heard his father, when I was laſt in the grove, adviſe him
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:027817_0181_0FD64F68CFCDF1B8"/>
not to fly about by himſelf, till he had ſhewn him the dangers of the world. Peckſy anſwered that ſhe know the value of parental inſtruction ſo well, that ſhe certainly would treaſure up in her heart every maxim of it; and the others promiſed to do the ſame: but, ſaid Flapſy, I cannot underſtand the nature of the accident which cauſed the death of the Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart. Neither can I explain it to you, my dear, ſaid the father; I only know that it is a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice for ſome men to carry inſtruments, from which they diſcharge what proves fatal to many a bird; but I have, by attentive obſervation learnt how to evade the miſchief. Whenever I go from the orchard, I always get upon a high tree and look all around me; if I ſee any gunners I take a different courſe (the thickneſs of the underwood prevented my diſcovering him who ſhot the Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart.) I alſo carefully avoid aſſociating with thoſe birds, which do miſchief to the property of mankind, for thoſe that join with thieves and ravagers deſerve, and muſt juſtly expect to ſhare their fate: let me therefore adviſe you to be particularly careful to keep proper company, and gain an honeſt character, as it will enſure you the good opinion of others. But come, let us deſcend, as we may do it with ſafety, and refreſh ourſelves a little, and then will ſee if we cannot find a place where you may have

amuſement, without being expoſed to ſuch dangers as attend the inhabitants of woods and groves. Are you ſufficiently reſted to take a pretty long flight? O yes, cried Dicky, who was quite eager to leave the ſpot, in which, a ſhort time before, he had longed to paſs his life; the reſt joined in the ſame wiſh, and every wing was inſtantly expanded.</p>

               <p>THE father led the way, and in a very ſhort ſpace of time he and his family arrived at the eſtate of a Gentleman, who, having a plentiful for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, endeavoured to collect all that was curious in art and nature, for the amuſement of his own mind, and the gratification of others. He had a houſe like a palace furniſhed with every expenſive rarity; his gardens, to which the Redbreaſts took their flight, were laid out in ſuch a manner as to afford the moſt delightful variety to the eye. Amongſt other articles of taſte were an aviary and a mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery. The former was built like a temple, encloſed with braſs wire; the frame-work was painted green and ornamented with carving gilt; in the middle a fountain continually threw up freſh water, which
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:027817_0183_0FD64F6B6E7CECB8"/>
fell into a baſon whoſe brink was enamelled with flowers; at one end were partitions for birds neſts, and troughs containing various kinds of ſeed, and materials for building neſts; this part was carefully ſheltered from every inclemency of weather, and numbers of perches were planted in different parts of the aviary, and it was ſurrounded by a moſt beautiful ſhrubbery.</p>
               <p>A habitation like this, in which all the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of life ſeemed to be collected, where abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance was ſupplied without toil, where each gay ſongſter might ſing himſelf to repoſe in the midſt of eaſe and plenty, ſafe from the dangers of the woods, appeared to our young travellers deſirable beyond all the ſituations in the world, and Dicky expreſſed an earneſt deſire to be admitted into it. Well, ſaid the father, let us not determine haſtily, it will be adviſeable firſt to enquire whether its inhabitants are really happy, before you make intereſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one of the number; place yourſelf by me in this ſhrub, and whilſt we reſt ourſelves we ſhall have an opportunity of obſerving what paſſes.</p>
               <p>The firſt bird that attracted their notice was a Dove, who ſat cooing by himſelf in a corner in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents ſo gentle and ſweet, that a ſtranger to his language would have liſtened to him with delight; but the Redbreaſts, who underſtood their import, heard them with ſympathetic concern.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="unknown:027817_0184_0FD64F6E0FBBAA08"/>"Oh, my dear, my beloved mate," ſaid he, "am I then divided from you for ever? What avails it, that I am furniſhed here with all the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies and luxuries of life? Deprived from your company, I have no enjoyment of them; the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt morſel, though gained with toil and danger, would be infinitely preferable to me if ſhared with you. Here I am ſhut up for the remainder of my days, in ſociety for which I have no reliſh, whilſt ſhe, who has hitherto been the beloved partner of all my joys, is for ever ſeparated from me! In vain will you, with painful wing, purſue your anxious ſearch in queſt of me! never, never more, ſhall I bring you the welcome refreſhment; never ſhall I hear your ſoothing voice, and delight in the ſoft murmurs of the infant pair, which you hatched with ſuch care, and nurſed with ſuch tenderneſs! No, my beloved neſtlings, never will your wretched fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be at liberty to guide your flight and inſtruct you in the duties of your ſtation!" Here his voice faultered, and overcome with bitter reflection, he reſigned himſelf a prey to ſilent ſorrow.</p>
               <p>This Dove is not happy, however, ſaid the hen Redbreaſt to her mate, and no wonder: but let us
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:027817_0185_0FD64F7005102C50"/>
attend to the notes of that Lark. His eyes were turned up towards the ſky, he fluttered his wings, he ſtrained his throat, and would to a human eye, have appeared in raptures of joy; but the Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaſts perceived that he was inflamed with rage. "And am I to be conſtantly confined in this horrid place?" ſang he. "Is my upward flight to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded by bras and wires? Muſt I no longer ſoar to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that bright luminary, and make the arch of heaven reſound with my ſinging? ſhall I ceaſe to be the herald of the morn, or muſt I be ſo in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſphere?

                  </gap> of evenings, but muſt I, to gratify your unfeeling wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, be ſecluded from every joy my heart holds dear, and condemned to a ſituation I deteſt? Take your delicious dainties, reſerve your flowing ſtream for thoſe who can reliſh them, but give me liberty. But why do I addreſs myſelf to you who are heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of my miſery?" Here caſting an indignant look around, ſtopt his ſong.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="unknown:027817_0186_0FD64F719149B090"/>What think you now, Dicky, ſaid the Redbreaſts, have you as high an idea of the happineſs of this place, as you conceived on the firſt view of it? I can't help thinking ſtill, replied Dicky, that it is a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing retreat, and muſt be very comfortable to have every thing provided for one's uſe. Well, ſaid the father, let us move, and obſerve thoſe Linnets who are building their neſt. Accordingly they flew to a tree, whoſe branches formed a part of the ſhelter of the aviary, where they eaſily heard, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved, all that paſſed in it.</p>
               <p>"Come," ſaid one of the Linnets, "let us go on with our work, and finiſh the neſt; though it will be rather a melancholy taſk to hatch a ſet of little priſoners. How different was the caſe when we could anticipate the pleaſure of rearing a family to all the joys of liberty? Men, it is true, now, with officious care, ſupply us with the neceſſary mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, and we may make a very good neſt; but I proteſt I had much rather be at the trouble of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. What pleaſure have we experienced in plucking a bit of wool from a ſheep's back, in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for moſs, in ſelecting the beſt feather where numbers were left to our choice, in ſtopping to reſt
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:027817_0187_0FD64F741F660A48"/>
on the top of a tree, which commanded an extenſive proſpect, in joining a choir of ſongſters whom we accidentally met—But now our days paſs with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated ſameneſs; variety, ſo neceſſary to give a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to all enjoyment, is wanting. Inſtead of the ſongs a joy we formerly heard from every ſpray, our ears are conſtantly annoyed with the ſound of mournful lamentations, tranſports of rage, or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs of diſcontent. Could we reconcile ourſelves to the loſs of liberty, it is impoſſible to be happy here, unleſs we could harden our hearts to every ſympathetic feeling."</p>
               <p>"True," ſaid his mate; "yet I am reſolved to try what patience, reſignation, and employment will effect; and hope, as our young ones will never know what liberty is, they will not pine as we do for it." Saying this ſhe picked up a ſtraw, her mate followed the example, and they purſued their work.</p>
               <p>At this inſtant a hen Goldfinch brought forth her brood, who were full fledged. Come, ſaid ſhe, my neſtlings, uſe your wings; I have taught you to fly in all directions. She ſaying, the little ones divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one flew upwards; but emulous to out do a little
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:027817_0188_0FD64F75EEA60828"/>
Sparrow, which was flying in the air above the aviary, he hit himſelf againſt the wires of the dome, and would have fallen to the bottom, but that he was ſtopped by one of the perches.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he recovered, "Why cannot I ſoar as I ſee other birds do? ſaid he. "Alas!" cried the mother, "we are in a place of confinement; we are ſhut up and can never get out; but here is food in abundance, and every other neceſſary." "Never get out?" exclaimed the whole brood, "then adieu to happineſs!" She attempted to ſooth them, but in vain.</p>
               <p>The little Redbreaſts rejoiced in their liberty, and Dicky gave up the deſire of living in the aviary, and wiſhed to be gone. Stop, ſaid the father, let us firſt hear what thoſe Canaries are ſaying.</p>
               <p>The Canaries had almoſt compleated their neſt. "How fortunate is our lot," ſaid the hen bird "in being placed in this aviary! How preferable is it to the ſmall cage we built in laſt year? Yes," replied her mate; "yet how comfortable was that in compariſon to the ſtill ſmaller ones in which we were once ſeperately confined. For my part, I have no wiſh to fly abroad, for I ſhould neither know what to do, nor where to go; and it ſhall be my endeavour to inſpire my young ones with the ſame ſentiments I feel. Indeed, we owe the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

gratitude to thoſe who make ſuch kind proviſion for a ſet of foreigners, who have no reſources but their bounty; and my beſt lays ſhall be devoted to them. Nothing is wanting to compleat the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this place, but to have other kinds of birds excluded. Poor creatures! it muſt be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mortifying to them to be ſhut up here, and ſee others of their own kind enjoying freedom. No wonder they are perpetually quarrelling; for my part, I ſincerely pity them, and am ready to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the occaſional inſults and affronts I meet with out of compaſſion.</p>
               <p>You now concieve, Dicky, ſaid the cock Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaſt, that this place is not, as you ſuppoſed the region of perfect happineſs; you may alſo obſerve, that it is not the abode of univerſal wretchedneſs. It is by no means deſirable to be ſhut up for life, let the place of confinement be ever ſo ſplendid; but ſhould it at any time be your lot to be caught and impriſoned, which may poſſibly be the caſe, adopt the ſentiments of the Linnet and Canary Bird: em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment will paſs away many an hour that would have been a heavy load if ſpent in grief and anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; and reflections on the bleſſings and comforts that are ſtill in your power, will leſſen your regret for thoſe which are loſt. But come, pick up ſome of the ſeeds which are ſcattered on the outſide of
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:027817_0190_0FD64F7B1AF20A70"/>
the aviary, for that is no robbery, and then I will ſhew you another ſcene.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they had regaled themſeves with the ſuperfluities of the feathered captives, they took their flight to a different part of the garden, in which was a menagery.</p>
               <p>The menagery conſiſted of a number of pens, built round a graſs plat; in each was a pan of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a ſort of box, containing a bed or neſt, a trough for food, and a perch. In every pen were confined a pair of birds, and every pair was either of a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſpecies, or diſtinguiſhed by ſome beautiful va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety either of form or plumage. The wooden bars which were put in the front, were painted partly green and partly white, which dazzled the ſight at the firſt glance, and ſo attracted the eyes, that there was no ſeeing what was behind without going cloſe up to the pens.</p>
               <p>The little Redbreaſts knew not what ſight to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and begged their parents to gratify their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curioſity. Well, follow me, ſaid the father; but I believe we muſt alight upon the croſs-bars, or you will not be able to examine the beauties of theſe fowls. They did ſo, and in the firſt pen was a pair of Partridges. The ſize of theſe birds ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceeding their own, aſtoniſhed them all; but notwithſtanding this, the amiable Peckſy was quite
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:027817_0191_0FD64F7C9E34E518"/>
interreſted with their modeſt gentle appearance, and ſaid, ſhe thought no one could ever wiſh to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure them. True, Peckſy, replied the father, they have from the harmleſſneſs of their diſpoſition, a natural claim to tenderneſs and compaſſion; and yet I believe there are few birds who meet with leſs; for I have obſerved that numbers ſhare the ſame fate as the Redſtart, which you ſaw die in the grove. I have myſelf ſeen many put to death that way. For a long time I was exceſſively puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled on account of this fatality, and reſolved, if poſſible to gratify my curioſity. At length I ſaw a man kill two and take them away. This very man had ſhewn me great kindneſs, in feeding me, when I firſt left my father's neſt; ſo I had no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of his doing me an injury, and reſolved to follow him. When he arrived at his own houſe I ſaw him deliver the victims of his cruelty to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon, who hung them up together by the legs in a place which had a variety of other dead things in it, the ſight of which, ſhocked me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, and I could ſtay no longer. I therefore flew back to the field in which I had ſeen the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der committed; and in ſearching about ſound th neſt belonging to the poor creatures in which were ſeveral young ones juſt hatched, who in a ſhort time were ſtarved to death. How dreadful is the
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:027817_0192_0FD64F801E1F0770"/>
fate of young animals who loſe their parents before they are able to ſhift for themſelves! and how duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ought thoſe to be, to whom the bleſſing of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental inſtruction and aſſiſtance is continued!</p>
               <p>When the next morning arrived, I went again to ſee after the dead Partridges, and found them hanging as before; and this was the caſe the day after; but the following morning I ſaw a boy ſtripping all their feathers off. As ſoon as he had compleated this horrid operation, a woman took them, whom I ventured to follow, as the window of the place ſhe entered ſtood open; where to my aſtoniſhment, I beheld her twiſt their wings about, and faſten them to their ſides, then croſs their legs upon their breaſts, and run ſomething through their bodies. After this ſhe put them before a place, which glowed with a brightneſs ſomething reſembling the ſetting ſun, which, on the woman's retiring, I approached, and found intolerably hot; I therefore made a haſty retreat; but reſolving to know the end of the Partridges, kept hovering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the houſe; and at laſt looking into a window, I ſaw them ſmoking hot, ſet before the man who mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them, and was accompanied by ſeveral others; all of whom eyed them with as much delight, as I have ſeen any of you diſcover at the ſight of the fineſt worm or inſect that could be procured. In an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:027817_0193_0FD64F83B2AE9818"/>
after this, the poor Partridges were divided, limb from limb, and each one of the party preſent had his ſhare, till every bone was picked. There were ſome other things devoured in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: from which I learnt, that men feed on birds and other animals, as we do on thoſe little crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which are deſtined for our ſuſtenance, only they do not eat them alive. Pray, father, ſaid Dicky, do they eat Redbreaſts? I believe not, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he; but I have reaſon to ſuppoſe they make many a meal on Sparrows, for I have beheld vaſt numbers of them killed.</p>
               <p>At this inſtant their attention was attracted by one of the Partridges in the pen, who thus addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his mate.</p>
               <p>"Well, my love, as there is no chance for our being ſet at liberty, I think we may as well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our neſt, that you may depoſit your eggs in it. The employment of hatching and raiſing your little ones will, at leaſt, mitigate the weariſomeneſs of confinement, and I promiſe myſelf many happy days yet; for as we are ſo well fed and attended, I think we may form hopes that our offspring will alſo be provided for; and though they will not be at liberty to range about as we formerly did, they will avoid many of thoſe terrors and anxieties to which our race are frequently expoſed it one ſeaſon

of the year in particular." "I am very ready to follow your advice," ſaid the hen Partridge, "and the buſineſs will ſoon be compleated, for the neſt is in a manner made for us, it only wants a little adjuſting; I will therefore ſet about it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and will no longer waſte the hours in fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs lamentations, ſince I am convinced, that <hi>content</hi> will render every ſituation eaſy, in which we can enjoy the company of our deareſt friends, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the neceſſaries of life." So ſaying, ſhe retired into the place provided for the purpoſe on which ſhe was now intent, and her mate followed, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to lend her all the aſſiſtance in his power.</p>
               <p>I am very glad, ſaid the hen Redbreaſt, that my young ones have had an opportunity of ſeeing ſuch an example as this. You now underſtand what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit it is of to have a temper of reſignation; more than half the evils of life, I am well convinced, ariſe from fretfulneſs and diſcontent; and would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, like theſe Partridges, try to make the beſt of their condition, we ſhall hear but few com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; for there are much fewer <hi>real</hi> than <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> misfortunes. But come, let us take a peep into the next pen. Here they beheld a pair of fine Pheaſants, who were quietly picking up ſome grain that was ſcattered for them; from which might be inferred, that they had, like the Partridges, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:027817_0195_0FD64F87D93BE278"/>
themſelves to their lot. The little Redbreaſts were much pleaſed with the beauty of the cock bird; but as there was no converſation to be heard here, their parents deſired them to fly on; as pleaſures, by which the eye only was amuſed, were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of long attention.</p>
               <p>They accordingly hopped to the next partition, in which were confined a pair of penciled Pheaſants. Flapſy was quite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elighted with the elegance of their form, and the beauty of their plumage, and could have ſtaid the whole day looking at them; but as theſe birds were alſo tame and contented, nothing further could be learnt here, than a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of what the Partridges had taught. Our travellers therefore proceeded ſtill farther, and found a pair of gold Pheaſants. Their ſplendid ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ſtruck the young Redbreaſts with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and raiſed ſuch ſentiments of reſpect, that they were even fearful of approaching birds, which they eſteemed as ſo much ſuperior to themſelves: but their father deſiring they would never form a judgment of birds from a glittering outſide, placed his family where they had an opportunity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that this ſplendid pair had but little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic merit. They were proud of their fine plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and their employment was walking back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards to diſplay it; and ſometimes
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:027817_0196_0FD64F8D766AC558"/>
they endeavoured to puſh through the bars of their priſon, that they might get abroad to ſhew their rich plumage to the world, and exult over thoſe who were, in this reſpect, inferior to them. How hard, ſaid one of them, is it to be ſhut up here, where there are no other birds to admire us, and where we have no little ugly creatures to ridicule.</p>
               <p>If ſuch are your deſires, ſaid the hen Redbreaſt, I am ſure you are happier here than at liberty; for you would by your proud affected airs, excite the contempt of every bird who has right ſentiments, and conſequently meet with continual mortification, to which even the uglieſt might contribute.</p>
               <p>Peckſy deſired to know if all fine birds were proud and affected? By no means, replied her mother; you obſerved the other two pair of Pheaſants, who were, in my opinion nearly equal to theſe for beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and elegance. How eaſy and unaſſuming are they, and how much are their charms improved by the graces of humility! I often wonder that any bird ſhould indulge itſelf in pride. What have ſuch little creatures as we to boaſt of? The largeſt ſpecies amongſt us is very inferior to many animals we ſee in the world, and man is lord over the greateſt and ſtrongeſt even of theſe. Nay, man himſelf has no cauſe to be <hi>proud;</hi> for he is ſubject
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:027817_0197_0FD64F8F5CF6D738"/>
to death as well as the meaneſt creature in the world; as I have had opportunities to obſerve. But come, the day wears away, let us view the other parts of this incloſure.</p>
               <p>On this the father conducted his family to a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of pens, in which were different ſorts of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign birds, of whom he could give but little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; therefore would not ſuffer his young ones to ſtand gazing at them long, leſt they ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe injurious notions on them: eſpecially when he heard Dicky cry out, as he left the laſt pen,—I dare ſay that Stork is a very cruel voracious creature; I make no doubt but he would eat us all one after the other if he could get at us. Take care, Dicky, ſaid the father, how you form an ill opinion of any one on ſlight grounds. You cannot poſſibly tell what the character of this Stork is, merely from his appearance; you are a ſtranger to his language, and cannot ſee the diſpoſition of his heart. If you give way to a ſuſpicious temper, your own little breaſt will be in a ſtate of conſtant perturbation; you will abſolutely exclude yourſelf from the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of ſociety, and will be ſhunned and deſpiſed by every bird of every kind. This Stork, whom you thus cenſure, is far from deſerving your ill opinion. He would do you no harm, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for his filial affection. I ſaw him taken priſoner. He was carrying his aged father on his
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:027817_0198_0FD76EE9F7B1C830"/>
back, whom he had for a long time fed and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the weight of his precious burden impeded his flight; and being at length wearied with it, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the ground to reſt himſelf, when a cruel man, who was out on the buſineſs of bird catching, threw a net over them, and then ſeized him by the neck. His poor father, who was before worn out with age and infirmities, unable to bear this cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, therefore fell from his back and inſtantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired. This Stork, after caſting a look of anguiſh on his dear parent, which I ſhall never forget, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fury on his perſecutor, whom he beat with his wings with all the ſtrength he had; but it was in vain to contend with a being ſo much more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than himſelf, and, in ſpite of all his exertions, he was conveyed to this place. But come, let us pick up a little refreſhment, and then return to the orchard. Saying this, he alighted on the ground, as did his mate and her family, where they met with a plentiful repaſt in the proviſions which had been accidentally ſcattered by the perſon, whoſe employment it was to bring food for the inhabitants of the menagery. When they had ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galed themſelves, all parties gladly returned to the neſt, and every heart rejoiced in the poſſeſſion of liberty and peace.</p>

               <p>FOR three ſucceſſive days nothing remarkable happened, either at Mr. Benſon's or the Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaſts neſt. The little family came daily to the breakfaſt-table, and Robin daily recovered from his accident, though not ſufficiently to fly well; but Dicky, Flapſy, and Peckſy continued ſo healthy, and improved ſo faſt that they required no further care; and the third morning after their tour to the grove, &amp;c. they did not commit the leaſt error. When they retired from the parlour into the court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, to which Robin accompanied them, the father expreſſed great delight, that they were at length able to ſhift for themſelves. And now a wonderful charge took place in his own heart. That ardent affection for his young, which had hitherto made him, for their ſakes, patient of toil, and fearleſs of danger, was on a ſudden quinched<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but from the goodneſs of his diſpoſition, he ſtill felt a kind of ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for their further welfare; therefore called them around him, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> addreſſed them.</p>
               <p>"You muſt be ſenſible, my dear young ones, that from the time you left the egg-ſhell, till the preſent inſtant, both your mother and I nouriſhed you with the tendereſt love. We have taught you all the arts of life which are neceſſary to procure
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:027817_0200_0FD6259D11DD0750"/>
you ſubſiſtence, and preſerve you from danger. We have ſhewn you a variety of characters in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent claſſes of birds; and pointed out thoſe which are to be imitated, and thoſe which are to be ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. You muſt now ſhift for yourſelves; but before we part, let me repeat my admonition, to uſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, avoid contention, cultivate peace, and be contented with your condition. Let none of your own ſpecies excel you in any amiable quality, for want of your endeavours to equal the beſt; and do your duty in every relation of life, as we have done ours by you. Prefer a calm retirement to the gay ſcenes of levity and diſſipation, for there the greateſt degree of happineſs is to be found. You, Robin, I would adviſe, on account of your infirmity, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach yourſelf to Mr. Benſon's family, where you have been ſo kindly cheriſhed."</p>
               <p>Whilſt he thus ſpake, his mate ſtood by, who finding the ſame change beginning to take place in her own breaſt, ſhe viewed her family with tender regret; and when he ceaſed, cried out, "Adieu ye dear objects of my late cares and ſolicitude! may ye never more ſtand in need of a mother's aſſiſtance! Though nature now diſmiſſes me from the arduous taſk, which I have long daily performed, I rejoice not, but would gladly continue my toil, for the ſake of its attendant plaiſures. Oh! delightful ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of maternal love, how can I part with you?
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:027817_0201_0FD625A3AC2ABB70"/>
Let me, my neſtlings, give you a laſt embrace." Then ſpreading her wings, ſhe folded them ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to her boſom, and inſtantly recovered her tranquility. E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ch young one expreſſed its grateful thanks to both father and mother, and with theſe acknowledgements filial affection expired in their breaſts; inſtead of which, a reſpectful friendſhip ſucceeded. Thus was that tender tie diſſolved, which had hitherto bound this little family toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for the parents had performed their duty, and the young ones had no need of f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The old Redbreaſts having now only themſelves to provide for, reſolved to be no longer burthenſome to their benefactors; and after pouring forth their gratitude in the moſt lively ſtrains, they took their flight together, reſolving never to ſeparate. Every care now vaniſhed, and their little hearts felt no ſentiments but theſe of cheerfulneſs and joy. They ranged the fields and gardens, ſipped at the cooleſt ſprings, and indulged themſelves in the pleaſures of ſociety, joining their cheerful notes with thoſe of other gay choriſters, who animate and heighten the delightful ſcenes of rural life.</p>

<pb n="203" facs="unknown:027817_0202_0FD625A52BDD6690"/>
that they had left their neſtlings; as it was the nature of animals in general to diſmiſs their young, as ſoon as they were able to provide for themſelves. That is very ſtrange, replied Miſs Harriet; I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what would become of my brother and me, were you and papa to ſerve us ſo? And is a boy of ſix, or a girl of eleven years old, capable of ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for themſelves? ſaid her mamma. No, my dear child, you have need of a much longer continuance of our care than birds and other animals; and therefore GOD has ordained that parental affection, when once awakened, ſhould always remain in the human breaſt, unleſs extinguiſhed by the undutiful behaviour of the child.</p>
               <p>And ſhall we ſee the old Redſtreaſts no more? cried Frederick. I do not know that you will, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Mrs. Benſon, though it is not unlikely that they may viſit us again in the winter; but let not their abſence grieve you, my love, for I dare ſay they are very ſafe and happy.</p>
               <p>At that inſtant the young ones arrived, and met with a very joyful reception. The amuſement they afforded to Maſter Benſon, reconciled him to the loſs of their parents; but Harriet declared, ſhe could not help being ſorry that they were gone. I ſhall, for the future mamma ſaid ſhe, take a great deal of notice of animals; for I have had much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment in obſerving the ways of theſe Robins
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:027817_0203_0FD64F91619C1C58"/>
I highly approve your reſolution, my dear, ſaid Mrs. Benſon, and hope the occaſional inſtruction I have at different times given you, has furniſhed you with general ideas reſpecting the proper treatment of animals. I will now inform you upon what prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples the rules of conduct I preſcribe to myſelf on this ſubject are founded.</p>
               <p>I conſider that the ſame almighty and good GOD, who created mankind, made all other living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures likewiſe; and appointed them their different ranks in the creation, that they might form together a community, receiving and conferring reciprocal benefits.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt that the Almighty deſigned all beings for happineſs, proportionable to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties he endued them with; therefore whoever wantonly deſtroys that happineſs, acts contrary to the will of his Maker.</p>
               <p>The world we live in ſeems to have been princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally deſigned for the uſe and comfort of mankind, who, by the Divine appointment, have dominion over the inferior creatures; in the exerciſe of which, it is certainly their duty to imitate the <hi>ſupreme Lord of the Univerſe,</hi> by being merciful to the utmoſt of their power. They are endued with reaſon, which enables them to diſcover the different natures of brutes, the faculties they poſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſs, and how they may be made ſerviceable to the world; and as
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:027817_0204_0FD64F9257587C78"/>
beaſts cannot apply theſe faculties to their own uſe in ſo extenſive a way, and numbers of them (being unable to provide for their own ſuſtenance) are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to men for many of the neceſſaries of life, men have an undoubted right to their labour in return.</p>
               <p>Several other kinds of animals, which are ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the expence of mankind, cannot labour for them; from ſuch they have a natural claim to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they can ſupply towards the food and raiment of their benefactors; and therefore when we take the wool and milk of the flocks and herds we take no more than our due, and what they can very well ſpare; as they ſeem to have an over-abundance given them, that they may be able to return their obligations to us.</p>
               <p>Some creatures have nothing to give us but their own bodies: theſe have been expreſsly deſtined, by the <hi>Supreme Governor,</hi> as food for mankind, and he has appointed an extraordinary increaſe of them for this very purpoſe; ſuch an increaſe, as would be very injurious to us if all were ſuffered to live. Theſe we have an undoubted right to kill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we ſhould make their ſhort lives as comfortable as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
               <p>Other creatures ſeem to be of no particular uſe to mankind, but as they ſerve to furniſh our minds
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:027817_0205_0FD64F9640506220"/>
with contemplations on the wiſdom, power and goodneſs of GOD, and to exhilarate our ſpirits by their cheerfulneſs; theſe ſhould not be wantonly kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, nor treated with the leaſt degree of cruelty, but ſhould be at full liberty to enjoy the bleſſings aſſigned them; unleſs they abound to ſuch a degree, as to become injurious, by devouring the food which is deſigned for man, or for animals more immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely beneficial to him, whom it is his duty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect.</p>
               <p>Some animals, ſuch as wild beaſts, ſerpents, &amp;c. are in their natures ferocious, noxious, or venemous, and capable of injuring the health, or even of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the lives of men, and other creatures of a higher rank than themſelves: theſe, if they leave the ſecret abodes which are allotted them, and become offenſive, certainly may with juſtice be killed.</p>
               <p>In a word, my dear, we ſhould endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate our regards, according to the utility and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of every living creature with which we are any way connected; and conſequently ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the happineſs of <hi>mankind</hi> to that of any <hi>animal</hi> whatever.

               <p>Whilſt Mrs. Benſon was giving theſe inſtructions to her daughter, Frederick diverted himſelf with the young Robins, who having no kind parents now to admoniſh them, made a longer viſit than uſual; ſo th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>AS the old Robins, who were Hero and Heroine of my tale, are made happy it is time for me to put an end to it: but my young readers will doubtleſs wiſh to know the ſequel of the hiſtory, I ſhall therefore inform them of it in as few words as poſſible.</p>
               <p>Miſs Harriet followed her mamma's precepts and example, and grew up an <hi>univerſal Benefactreſs</hi> to all people, and all creatures, with whom ſhe was any ways connected.</p>
               <p>Frederick was educated upon the ſame plan, and and was never known to be cruel to animals, or to treat them with an improper degree of fondneſs: he was alſo remarkable for his benevolence, ſo as to deſerve and obtain the character of a GOOD MAN.</p>
               <p>Miſs Lucy Jenkins was quite reformed by Mrs. Benſon's lecture, and her friend's example; but her brother continued his practice of exerciſing barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities on a variety of unfortunate animals, till he went to ſchool, where having no opportunity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, he gratified his malignant diſpoſition on his ſchool-fellows, and made it his diverſion to pull the hair, pinch, and teaze the younger boys; and by the time he became a man had ſo hardened his
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:027817_0208_0FD64F9AAD7B95D0"/>
heart, that no kind of diſtreſs affected him, nor did he care for any perſon but himſelf; conſequently, he was deſpiſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y all with whom he had any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe. In this manner he lived for ſome years; at length, as he was inhumanly beating and ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a fine horſe, merely becauſe it did not go a faſter pace than it was able to do, the poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in its efforts to evade his blows, threw his brabarous rider, who was killed on the ſpot.</p>
               <p>Farmer Wilſon's proſperity increaſed with every ſucceeding year, and he acquired a plentiful for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, with which he gave portions to each of his children, as opportunities offered, for ſettling them in the world; and he and his wife lived to a good old age, beloved and reſpected by all who knew them.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Addis loſt her parrot, by the diſorder with which it was attacked whilſt Mrs. Benſon was viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the houſe, and before ſhe had recovered the ſhock of this <hi>misfortune,</hi> as ſhe called it, her grief was renewed by the death of the old lap-dog<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> About a year afterwards her monkey eſcaped to the top of the houſe, from whence he fell and broke his neck. The favourite cat went mad, and was obliged to be killed. In ſhort, by a ſeries of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, all her <hi>dear darlings</hi> were ſucceſſively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. She ſupplied their places with new fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vourites,
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:027817_0209_0FD64F9D4A7A4FE0"/>
who gave her a great deal of fatigue and trouble.</p>
               <p>In the mean while her children grew up, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing experienced no tenderneſs from her, they ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew they had a mamma; nor did thoſe who had the care of their education inculcate that <hi>her</hi> want of affection <hi>did not cancel their duty,</hi> they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore treated her with the utmoſt neglect, and ſhe had no friend left. In her old age, when ſhe was no longer capable of amuſing herſelf with dogs, cats, parrots, and monkies, ſhe became ſenſible of her errors, and wiſhed for the comforts which other parents enjoyed, but it was now too late, and ſhe ended her days with ſorrow and regret.</p>
               <p>This unfortunate Lady had tenderneſs enough in her diſpoſition for all the purpoſes of humanity; and had ſhe placed it on proper objects, agreeably to Mrs. Benſon's rule, might have been, like her, a good wife, mother, friend, and miſtreſs, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, reſpectable and happy. But when a child, Mrs. Addis was (under an idea of making her <hi>tender hearted</hi>) permitted to laviſh <hi>immoderate fondneſs</hi> on animals, the care of which engroſſed her whole at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and greatly interrupted her education; ſo that, inſtead of ſtudying natural hiſtory, or other uſeful things, her time was taken up with pamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and attending upon animals, which ſhe conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the moſt important buſineſs in life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="unknown:027817_0210_0FD6259959134408"/>Her children fell into faults of a different nature. Miſs Addis being, as I obſerved in a former part of this hiſtory, left to the care of ſervants, grew up with very contracted notions. Amongſt other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, ſhe imbibed that of being afraid of ſpiders, frogs, and other harmleſs things; and having been bit by the monkey when it eſcaped, as I before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and terrified by the cat, when it went mad, ſhe extended her fears to every kind of creature, and could not take a walk in the fields, or even in the ſtreet, without a thouſand apprehenſions. At laſt, her conſtitution, which from bad nurſing was very delicate, was ſtill more weakened by her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual apprehenſions; and a rat happening to run acroſs the path, as ſhe was walking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe fell into ſits, which afflicted her, at intervals, during the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of her life.</p>
               <p>Maſter Addis, as ſoon as he became ſenſible of his mother's foible, conceived an inveterate hatred to animals in general, whom he regarded as his enemies; and thought he was avenging his own cauſe when he treated any with barbarity. Cats and dogs, in particular, he ſingled out as the objects of his revenge, becauſe he conſidered them as his mother's greateſt favourites: and many a one fell an innocent victim to his miſtaken ideas.</p>
               <p>The parent Redbreaſts viſited their kind bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors the next winter; but as they were flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:027817_0211_0FD64FA0A2B21098"/>
one day, they ſaw ſome crumbs of bread, which had been ſcattered by Miſs Lucy Jenkins, who, (as I obſerved before) had adopted the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of her friend, in reſpect to compaſſion for animals, and reſolved to imitate her in every excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. The Redbreaſts gratefully picked up the crumbs, and, encouraged by the gentle invitation of her looks, reſolved to repeat their viſits; which they accordingly did, and found ſuch an ample ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that they thought it more adviſeable to go to her with their next brood, than to be burthenſome to their old benefactors, who had a great number of penſioners to ſupport: but Maſter and Miſs Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had frequently the pleaſure of ſeeing them, and knew them from all their ſpecies by ſeveral parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities, which ſo long an acquaintance had given them the opportunity of obſerving.</p>
               <p>Robin, in purſuance of his father's advice, and agreeably to his own inclinations, attached himſelf to Mr. Benſon's family, where he was an exceeding great favourite. He had before, under the conduct of his parents, made frequent excurſions into the garden, and was, by their direction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> enabled to get up into trees, but his wing never recovered ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to enable him to make long flights: however, he found himſelf at liberty to do as he pleaſed, and therefore, during the ſummer months commonly paſſed moſt of his time abroad, and rooſted in trees,
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:027817_0212_0FD64FA0A6E19530"/>
but viſited the tea-table every morning; and there he uſually met his ſiſter Peckſy, who took up her abode in the orchard, where ſhe enjoyed the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of her father and mother. Dicky and Flapſy, who thought their company too grave, flew giddily about together. In a ſhort time they were both caught in a trap-cage, and put into the aviary, which Dicky once longed to inhabit. Here they were at firſt very miſerable; but after a while, recollecting their good parent's advice, and the example of the Linnets and Pheaſants, they at length reconciled themſelves to their lot, and each met with a mate with whom they lived to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably happy.</p>
               <p>From the foregoing examples, I hope my young readers will ſelect the beſt for their own imitation, and take warning by the reſt, otherwiſe my hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are written in vain.</p>
               <p>Happy would it be for the animal creation, if every human being, like good Mrs. Benſon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the welfare of inferior creatures, and neither ſpoiled them by indulgence, or injured them by tyranny! Happy would mankind be, if every one,
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:027817_0213_0FD64FA224CA4DF0"/>
like her, acted in conformity to the will of their Maker; by cultivating in their own minds, and thoſe of their children, the <hi>divine principle</hi> of UNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERSAL BENEVOLENCE!</p>
