            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE Great Business of <hi>Man's</hi> Life is, to answer the <hi>End</hi> for which he <hi>Lives;</hi> and that is, <hi>To Glorify God, and save his own Soul:</hi> This is the Decree of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as Old as the World. But so it is, that <hi>Man</hi> mindeth nothing less, than what he should most Mind; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth to inquire into his own <hi>Being,</hi> its <hi>Original, Duty</hi> and <hi>End;</hi> chusing rather to Dedicate his Days (the Steps he should make to <hi>Blessedness</hi>) to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the <hi>Pride, Avarice</hi> and <hi>Luxury</hi> of his Heart; as if he had been Born for himself, or rather given himself <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
               <pb facs="unknown:006041_0004_0F646EB3371B8B40"/>
and so not subject to the <hi>Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> of a <hi>Superior Power.</hi> To this Wild and Lamentable Pass hath poor <hi>Man</hi> brought himself, by his <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience</hi> to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in his Heart, <hi>by doing that which he knows he should not do, and leaving undone what he knows he should do.</hi> And as long as this <hi>Disease</hi> continueth upon <hi>Man,</hi> he will make his <hi>God</hi> his <hi>Enemy,</hi> and himself uncapable of the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> that he hath manifested by his Son, <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> to the World.</p>
            <p>If, <hi>Reader,</hi> thou art such an one, my Counsel to thee is, To <hi>Retire</hi> into <hi>Thy Self,</hi> and take a View of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thy <hi>Soul;</hi> for Christ hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee <hi>Light,</hi> with which to do it: <hi>Search</hi> carefully and throughly, thy <hi>Life</hi> is upon it; thy <hi>Soul</hi> is at Stake. 'Tis but <hi>once</hi> to be done; if thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busest
<pb facs="unknown:006041_0005_0F646EB3EB84E268"/>
thy self in it, the Loss is Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable; the World is not <hi>Price</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Ransom thee: Wilt thou then, for such a <hi>World,</hi> be-late thy self, over-stay the time of thy <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and lose thy <hi>Soul?</hi> Thou hast to do (I grant thee) with great <hi>Patience;</hi> but that also must have an End: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore provoke not that <hi>God</hi> that made thee, to reject thee. Dost thou know what it is? 'Tis <hi>Tophet, 'tis Hell, the Eternal Anguish of the Damned.</hi> Oh! <hi>Reader,</hi> as one knowing the <hi>Terrors</hi> of the Lord, I perswade thee to be <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, Diligent</hi> and <hi>Fervent</hi> about thy own <hi>Salvation!</hi> Ay, and as one know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Comfort, Peace, Joy</hi> and <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of the Ways of <hi>Righteousness</hi> too, I Exhort and Invite thee, to embrace the Reproofs and Convictions of Christ's <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in thine own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
<pb facs="unknown:006041_0006_0F646EB4ADB63D70"/>
and bear the <hi>Judgment,</hi> who hast wrought the Sin. <hi>The Fire burns but the Stubble; the Wind blows but the Chaff:</hi> Yield up thy <hi>Body, Soul</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> to <hi>Him</hi> that maketh all things <hi>New; New Heavens</hi> and <hi>New Earth, New Love, New Joy, New Peace, New Works,</hi> a <hi>New Life</hi> and <hi>Conversation.</hi> Men are grown corrupt and <hi>drossy</hi> by <hi>Sin,</hi> and they must be Saved thro' <hi>Fire,</hi> which purgeth it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; therefore the <hi>Word of God</hi> is compar'd to a <hi>Fire,</hi> and the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi> to an <hi>Oven;</hi> and Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to a <hi>Refiner of Gold,</hi> and a <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier</hi> of <hi>Silver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Come, <hi>Reader,</hi> hearken to me a while; I seek thy Salvation; that's my <hi>Plot;</hi> thou wilt forgive me. A <hi>Refiner</hi> is come near thee, His Grace hath appear'd to thee: It shews thee
<pb facs="unknown:006041_0007_0F646EB56BC24D10"/>
the <hi>World's Lusts,</hi> and teacheth thee to <hi>Deny</hi> them. Receive his <hi>Leaven,</hi> and it will <hi>Change</hi> thee; His <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,</hi> and it will <hi>Cure</hi> thee: He is as Infallible as Free; <hi>without Money,</hi> and with Certainty. <hi>A Touch of his Garment</hi> did it of Old; It will do it still: His <hi>Vertue</hi> is the same, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be exhausted; For <hi>in Him the Fulness dwells:</hi> Blessed be <hi>God</hi> for his Sufficiency. He laid <hi>Help upon Him, that He might be Mighty to Save all that come to God through him:</hi> Do thouso, and he will Change thee: Ay, thy <hi>Vile Body,</hi> like unto his <hi>Glorious Body.</hi> He is the great <hi>Philosopher</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the <hi>Wisdom of God,</hi> that turns <hi>Lead</hi> into <hi>Gold, Vile Things</hi> into <hi>Things Precious:</hi> For he maketh <hi>Saints</hi> out of <hi>Sinners,</hi> and almost <hi>Gods</hi> of <hi>Men.</hi> What rests to us then, that we must
<pb facs="unknown:006041_0008_0F646EB62BFE15C0"/>
do, to be thus Witnesses of his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Love?</hi> This is the <hi>CROWN:</hi> But where is the <hi>CROSS?</hi> Where is the <hi>Bitter Cup</hi> and <hi>Bloody Baptism?</hi> Come, <hi>Reader,</hi> be like him; for this <hi>Transcendant Joy,</hi> lift up thy Head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the World; then thy Salvation will draw nigh indeed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christ's CROSS is Christ's Way to Christ's CROWN.</hi> This is the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of the <hi>following Discourse;</hi> first writ during my <hi>Confinement</hi> in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> in the Year 1668<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now Re-printed with great Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Testimonies;</hi> that thou, <hi>Reader,</hi> may'st be won to <hi>Christ;</hi> and if won already, brought nearer to <hi>Him.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Path, God</hi> in his Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Kindness guided my Feet into, in the Flower of my <hi>Youth.</hi> when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Two</hi> and <hi>Twenty</hi> Years of Age:

The way is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, a denial of Self, the pleasure of Sin, to please God and obey his Will, as manifested to the Soul by the Light he gives it.</hi> §. 6. <hi>This shows the difficulty, yet the necessity of the Cross.</hi> From p. 28. to p. 34.</item>

In</hi> Jeremiah'<hi>s</hi> T<hi>ime it was the same; his Goodness was manifested to his Children that waited truly upon him:</hi> 'T<hi>was an</hi> Inward Sense <hi>and</hi> Enjoyment <hi>of him they thirsted after.</hi> C<hi>hrist charged his Disciples also to wait for the Spirit.</hi> §. 12. T<hi>his Doctrine of</hi> Waiting <hi>further opened, and ended with an Allusion to the</hi> Pool <hi>of</hi> Bethesda; <hi>a lively Figure of</hi> inward Waiting, <hi>and its blessed Effects.</hi> §. 13. <hi>Four</hi> T<hi>hings necessary to</hi> Worship: T<hi>he</hi> Sanctification <hi>of the</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipper, <hi>and the</hi> Consecration <hi>of the</hi> Offering, <hi>and the</hi> Thing <hi>to be</hi> prayed for; <hi>and lastly,</hi> Faith <hi>to</hi> pray <hi>in: And all must be right, that is, of God's giving.</hi> §. 14.

<pb n="2" facs="unknown:006041_0026_0F646EC5E8D913B8"/>
for that it is the <hi>only</hi> Door to true Christianity, and <hi>that Path</hi> the Ancients ever trod to Blessedness: Yet, with extream Affiction, let me say, it is so little Understood, so much Neglected, and what is worse, so bitterly Contradicted, by the <hi>Vanity, Superstition,</hi> and <hi>Intemperance</hi> of Profess'd Christians, that we must either renounce to believe what the <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> hath told us, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 23. <hi>That whosoever does not take up his daily Cross, and follow him, cannot be his Disciple:</hi> Or, admitting that for Truth, conclude, that the generality of <hi>Christendom</hi> do miserably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and disappoint themselves in the great business of Christianity, and their own Salvation.</p>
                  <p>§. II. For, let us be never so Tender and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in the Survey of those Nations, that intitle themselves to any Interest in the Holy Name of Christ, if we will but be Just too, we must needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that after all the gracious Advantages of <hi>Light,</hi> and Obligations to <hi>Fidelity,</hi> which these latter Ages of the World have received, by the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Life, Doctrine, Miracles, Death, Resurrection,</hi> and <hi>Ascension</hi> of Christ, with the <hi>Gifts</hi> of his Holy Spirit; to which add the <hi>Writings, Labours,</hi> and <hi>Martyrdom</hi> of his dear <hi>Followers</hi> in all times; there seems very little left of <hi>Christianity</hi> but the Name: Which being now usurp'd by the old <hi>Heathen</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Life, makes the Professors of it but <hi>True Heathens in disguise.</hi> For tho' they Worship not the <hi>same Idols,</hi> they worship Christ with the <hi>same Heart:</hi> And they can never do otherwise, whilst

they live in the <hi>same Lusts.</hi> So that the <hi>Unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Christian</hi> and the <hi>Heathen</hi> are of the <hi>Same Religion.</hi> For tho' they have different Objects, to which they do direct their Prayers, that Adoration in both is but Forc'd and Ceremonious, and the Deity they truly worship, is the <hi>God of the World,</hi> the great Lord of Lusts: To him they bow with the whole powers of Soul and Sense. <hi>What shall we eat? What shall we drink? What shall we wear? And how shall we pass away our time? Which way may we gather Wealth, increase our Power, enlarge our Territories, and dignifie and perpetuate our Names and Families in the Earth?</hi> Which base Sensuality is most pathetically express'd and compriz'd by the Beloved Apostle <hi>John,</hi> in these words: <hi>The Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, which</hi> (says he) <hi>are not of the Father, but of the World,</hi> that lieth in Wickedness.<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Joh, 2. 16.</note>

                  <p>§. III.

For as the World is older, it is worse; and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of former lewd Ages, and their miserable Conclusions, have not deterr'd, but excited ours; so that the People of this, seems Improvers of the old stock of Impiety, and have carried it so much far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Example, that instead of advancing in <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> upon better times, they are scandalously fallen

                     <p>§. 1. <hi>By this</hi> Christendom <hi>may see her Lapse, how soul it is; and next, the worse for her pretence to Christianity.</hi> §. 2. <hi>But there is mercy with God upon repentance and propitiation in the blood of Jesus.</hi> §. 3. <hi>He is the Light of the World that reproves the darkness, that is, the evil of the World; and he is to be known within.</hi> §. 4. Christendom, <hi>like the Inn of old is full of other Guests: she is advised to believe, receive and apply it.</hi> §. 5. <hi>Of the nature of true Faith; it brings power to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come every appearance of evil. This leads to consider the Cross of Christ which has been so much wanted.</hi> §. 6. <hi>The Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ministry and End of it; its blessed Effect; the character of Apostolick times.</hi> §. 7. <hi>The Glory of the Cross, and its triumph over the Heathen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>world. A measure to</hi> Christendom <hi>what she is not, and should be.</hi> §. 8. <hi>Her declension and cause of it.</hi> §. 9. <hi>The miserable effects that followed.</hi> §. 10. <hi>From the consideration of the Cause, the Cure may be more easily known,</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>§. I. BY all which has been said, O <hi>Christendom,</hi> and by that better help, if thou wouldst use it, the <hi>Lamp</hi> the Lord has lighted in thee, not utterly extinct, it may evidently appear, first, How great and foul thy <hi>Backsliding</hi> has been, who from the <hi>Temple of the Lord,</hi> art become a <hi>Cage of Unclean Birds;</hi> and of an <hi>House of Prayer,</hi> a <hi>Den of Thieves,</hi> a <hi>Synagogue of Satan, and the Receptacle of every defiled Spirit.</hi> Next that, under all this manifest <hi>Defection,</hi> thou hast nevertheless valued thy corrupt self upon thy Profession of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and fearfully deluded thy self with the hopes of Salvation. The

first makes thy <hi>disease</hi> dangerous, but the last almost <hi>incurable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. II. Yet because there is <hi>Mercy</hi> with the God of Bowels, that he may be feared, and that he takes no delight in the Eternal Death of poor Sinners,<note n="*" place="bottom">Ezek. 18. 20, 23.</note> no, though <hi>Back-sliders</hi> themselves, but is willing all should come to the knowledge and obedience of the <hi>Truth;</hi> and be saved<note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 1. 21. Luke. 1. 77. Rom. 3. 25. Heb. 9. 24. to 28. 1 Joh,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>2. 1, 2.</note> He has set forth his <hi>Son a Propitiation,</hi> and given him a Saviour to take away the <hi>Sins</hi> of the whole World, that those that believe and follow him, may feel the Righteousness of God in the <hi>Remission</hi> of their <hi>Sins,</hi> and blotting out of their Transgressions for ever. Now, behold the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy!</hi> an <hi>Infallible Cure,</hi> one of God's appointing; a precious <hi>Elixir</hi> indeed, that never fail'd; and that <hi>Universal</hi> Medicine, which no Malady could ever escape.</p>
                  <p>§. III. But thou wilt say, <hi>What is Christ, and where is he to be found? And how received and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in order to this mighty Cure?</hi> I tell thee then: First, he is the great spiritual <hi>Light of the World,</hi> that <hi>enlightens every one that comes into the World;</hi> by which he manifests to them their Deeds of Darkness and Wickedness, and <hi>reproves</hi> them for committing them. Secondly, He is not far away from thee, as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> said of God to the <hi>Athenians</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="bottom">Acts 17. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold</hi> (says Christ himself) <hi>I stand at the Door and knock; if any Man hear my Voice, and open the Door, I
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006041_0041_0F646ED43734ACD8"/>
will come in to him, and sup with him, and he with me</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. 3. 20.</note> What door can this be, but that of the <hi>Heart</hi> of Man?</p>
                  <p>§. IV. Thou, like the <hi>Inn</hi> of old, hast been full of other <hi>Guests:</hi> Thy <hi>Affections</hi> have entertained o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Lovers:</hi> There has been no room for thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in thy Soul. Wherefore <hi>Salvation</hi> is not yet come into thy House, tho' it is come to thy Door, and thou hast been often proffered it, and hast profest it long. But if he <hi>calls,</hi> if he <hi>Knocks still,</hi> that is, if his <hi>Light</hi> yet Shines, if it reproves thee still, there is hopes thy Day is not over: and that repentance is not yet hid from thine Eyes; but his love is after thee still, and his holy Invitation continues to save thee.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, O <hi>Christendom! believe, receive</hi> and <hi>apply</hi> him rightly; this is of absolute Necessity, that thy Soul may live for ever with him. He told the <hi>Jews, Unless you believe that I am he, ye shall die in your sins; and whither I go, you shall not come</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="bottom">John 8. 24.</note>: And because they believed him not, they did not receive him, nor any benefit by him: But they that believed him, received him; <hi>And as many as received him,</hi> his own beloved Disciple tells us, <hi>to them gave he power to become the Sons of God; which are born not of Blood, nor of the Will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">John 1. 12, 13.</note> That is, <q>Who are not Children of God after the Fashions, Prescriptions and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men, that call themselves his <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>People</hi> (which is but after the Will of <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and the Invention of Carnal man, <hi>unacquainted</hi>
                        <pb n="18" facs="unknown:006041_0042_0F646ED5286C4828"/>
with the Regeneration and Power of the Holy Ghost) <hi>but of God;</hi> that is, according to his will, and the <hi>Working</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> of his <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> in them.</q> And such were ever well vers'd in the right Application of Christ, for he was made to them indeed <hi>Propitiation, Reconciliation, Salvation, Righteousness, Redemption</hi> and <hi>Justification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So I say to thee, Unless thou believest, that he that stands at the <hi>door</hi> of thy heart and Knocks, and sets thy sins in order before thee, and calls thee to Repentance, be the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the World, <hi>thou wilt dye in thy Sins, and where he is gone thou wilt never come.</hi> For if thou believest not in him, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that he should do thee good, or effect thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Christ works not against Faith, but by it. 'Tis said of old, <hi>He did not many mighty Works in some places, because the People believed not in him</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Mar. 6. 5.</note>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that if thou truly believest in him, thine ear will be attentive to his Voice in thee, and the door of thine heart <hi>open</hi> to his <hi>knocks.</hi> Thou wilt yield to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of his Light, and the Teachings of his Grace will be very Dear to Thee.</p>
                  <p>§. V. It is the nature of <hi>true</hi> Faith to beget an holy fear of offending God, a deep reverence to his Precepts, and a most tender regard to the inward Testimony of his Spirit, as that, by which his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in all Ages, have been safely led to Glory. For as they that truly believe, receive Christ in all his Tenders to the Soul; so, as true it is, that those who
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006041_0043_0F646ED5A83BD9B8"/>
receive him thus, with him, receive <hi>power</hi> to become the Sons of God: That is, an <hi>inward</hi> Force and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to do whatever he requires. Strength to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their Lusts, controle their Affections, resist evil Motions, deny themselves, and overcome the World in its most enticing Appearances. This is the <hi>Life</hi> of the blessed Cross of Christ, which is the subject of the following Discourse, and what thou, O Man, must take up, if thou intendest to be the Disciple of Jesus. Nor canst thou be said to receive Christ, or to believe in him, whilst thou rejectest his Cross: For as receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ is the means appointed of God to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, so bearing thy daily Cross after him, is the only true Testimony of receiving him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is enjoyned by him as the great token of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipleship; <hi>Whosoever will be my Disciple, let him take up his daily Cross and follow me</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 16. 24.</note>.</p>
                  <p>This, <hi>Christendom,</hi> is That thou hast so much wanted, and the want of which has prov'd the only cause of thy miserable <hi>Declension</hi> from pure <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> To consider which well (as it is thy Duty) so it is of great use to thy <hi>Restoration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For as the knowledge of the <hi>Cause</hi> of any <hi>Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> guides the <hi>Physician</hi> to make a right and safe Judgment in the Application of his <hi>Medicine;</hi> so it will much enlighten thee in the way of thy <hi>Recovery,</hi> to know &amp; weigh the first <hi>Cause</hi> of this <hi>spiritual Lapse</hi> and <hi>Malady</hi> that has befallen thee. To do which, a General View of thy <hi>primitive Estate,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

                  <p>§. VI. The <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Apostleship,</hi> we are told by a <hi>prime Labourer</hi> in it, was, <hi>To turn People from Darkness to Light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts 26. 18.</note> That is, instead of yielding to the <hi>Temptations and Motions</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> who is the Prince of Darkness (or Wickedness, the one being a Metaphor to the other) by whose power their <hi>Understandings</hi> were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured, and their <hi>Souls</hi> held in the service of Sin, they should turn their minds to the <hi>appearance</hi> of Christ, the <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Saviour</hi> of the World; who by his light, <hi>shines in their</hi> S<hi>ouls,</hi> and <hi>thereby</hi> gives them a sight of their sins and discovers <hi>every Temptation</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> in them unto evil, and reproves them when they give way thereunto; that so they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Children of <hi>Light,</hi> and walk in the Path of <hi>Righteousness.</hi> And for this blessed Work of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> did Christ endue his Apostles with his <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> that so men might not longer sleep in a security of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> of God, but awake to <hi>Righteousness,</hi> that the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> might give them <hi>Life:</hi> That is, that they might leave off sinning, deny themselves the pleasure of wickedness, and by <hi>true</hi> Repentance turn their hearts to God, in well-doing, in which is peace. And truly, <hi>God</hi> so blessed the <hi>faithful Labours</hi> of these poor <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> yet

§. VII. Indeed, the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Cross</hi> shined so conspicuously through the <hi>Self denial</hi> of their Lives, who daily bore it, that it struck the <hi>Heathen</hi> with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishment; and in a small time so shook their <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> discredited their <hi>Oracles,</hi> struck the multitude, invaded the <hi>Court,</hi> and overcame their Armies, that it led <hi>Priests, Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Generals</hi> in Triumph after it, as the <hi>Trophies</hi> of its Power and victory.</p>
                  <p>And while this integrity dwelt with Christians, mighty was the Presence, and invincible that <hi>Power</hi> that attended them: <hi>It quenched Fire, daunted Lyons, turned the edge of the Sword, out-fac'd Instruments of Cruelty, Convicted Judges, and converted Executioners</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I lay this down, as the undoubted <hi>Reason</hi> of this <hi>Degeneracy,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Inward disregard of thy Mind to the Light of Christ shining in thee, that first shewed thee thy sins and reproved them,</hi> and that taught and enabled thee to <hi>deny</hi> and <hi>resist</hi> them. For as thy <hi>Fear</hi> towards God, and holy Abstinence from Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness was, at first, not taught by the <hi>Precepts</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> but by that Light and Grace, which revealed the most secret <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and <hi>Purposes</hi> of thine <hi>heart,</hi> and searcht the most inward parts of thy Belly, (set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thy Sins in order before thee, and reproving thee for them, not suffering one unfruitful <hi>thought, word</hi> or <hi>work</hi> of <hi>Darkness</hi> to go unjudged) So when Thou didst begin to disregard that <hi>Light and Grace,</hi> to be careless of that holy <hi>Watch</hi> that was once set up in thine Heart, and didst not keep <hi>Centinel</hi> there (as formerly) for God's glory and thy own peace; the restless Enemy of man's good, quickly took ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this slackness, and often surprized Thee with Temptations, whose suitableness to thy Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations made his Conquest over thee not difficult.</p>

§. IX. Thus Religion fell from Experience to <hi>Tradition,</hi> and Worship from Power to <hi>Form,</hi> from Life to <hi>Letter;</hi> that instead of putting up lively and powerful Requests, animated by the deep sense of Want and the Assistance of the Holy Spirit, by which the Ancients prayed, wrestled and prevailed with God; behold, a <hi>by rote Mumpsimus,</hi> a dull and insipid <hi>Formality,</hi> made up of corporeal <hi>Bowings,</hi> and <hi>Cringings, Garments,</hi> and <hi>Furnitures, Perfumes, Voices</hi> and <hi>Musick;</hi> fitter for the Reception of some Earthly Prince, than the heavenly Worship of the only true and immortal God, who is an Eternal, Invisible Spirit.</p>
                  <p>But thy heart growing Carnal, thy <hi>Religion</hi> did so too: and not liking it as it was, <hi>fashioned</hi> it to thy liking; forgetting what the holy Prophet said, <hi>The Prayers of the Wicked are an Abomination to the Lord;</hi> and what <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>Ye ask, and ye receive not,</hi> (Why?) <hi>because ye ask amiss;</hi> that is, with an Heart that is not right, but <hi>insincere, unmortified,</hi> not in the Faith that <hi>purifies</hi> the Soul, and therefore can never receive what is askt: So that a man may say with Truth, thy Condition is the worse by thy Religion, because thou art tempted to think thy self the better for it, and art not.</p>

                  <p>§. 1. The <hi>Cross of Christ</hi> is a Figurative Speech, borrowed from the outward <hi>Tree,</hi> or <hi>Wooden Cross, on which Christ submitted to the Will of God, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him to suffer Death at the hands of evil Men.</hi> So that the <hi>Cross Mystical is that Divine Grace and Power, which crosseth the Carnal Wills of Men, and gives a contradiction to their corrupt Affections, and that constantly opposeth it self to the Inordinate and Fleshly Appetite of their Minds, and so may be justly Termed the Instrument of Man's holy Dying to the World, and being made conformable to the Will of God.</hi> For nothing else can mortifie Sin, or make it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

§. II. The Preaching of the <hi>Cross</hi> therefore in Primitive Times was fitly called by <hi>Paul</hi> (that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and skilful Apostle in Spiritual Things) the <hi>Power of God,</hi> tho' to them that perish, then, as now <hi>Foolishness.</hi> That is, to those that were truly <hi>weary</hi> and <hi>heavy laden,</hi> and needed a Deliverer; to whom Sin was burdensome and odious, the Preaching of the <hi>Cross</hi> by which Sin was to be mortified, was, as to them, the Power of God, or a Preaching of the Divine Power, by which they were made Disciples of Christ, and Children of God: And it wrought so powerfully upon them, that no proud or licentious Mock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Heart of Man is the <hi>Seat of Sin,</hi> and where he is Defiled, he must be Sanctified; and where Sin lives, there it must dye: It must be crucified.

Seals, to give knowledge, to direct the course of poor Man's Recovery, He came in the greatness of his Love and Strength; and though <hi>cloathed</hi> with the infirmities of a mortal Man, being within fortified by the Almightiness of an immortal God, he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled <hi>through all the straights and difficulties of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity;</hi> and first, of all others, trod the <hi>untrodden</hi> Path to Blessedness.</p>
                  <p>§. V. O come, let us follow him, the most <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied,</hi> the most <hi>Victorious</hi> Captain of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! To whom all the great <hi>Alexanders</hi> and mighty <hi>Caesars</hi> of the World are less than the poorest <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier</hi> of their Camps could be to them. True, they were all <hi>Great Princes</hi> of their kind, and Conquerors too, but on very differing Principles. For <hi>Christ made himself of no Reputation to save Mankind;</hi> but these plentifully Ruin'd People, to augment theirs. They vanquish'd others, <hi>not themselves;</hi> Christ conquer'd SELF, that ever vanquish'd them: Of Merit therefore the <hi>most excellent Prince</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror.</hi> Besides, They advanc'd their Empire by <hi>Rapine</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> but He by <hi>Suffering</hi> and <hi>Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:</hi> He never by Compulsion, They always by Force, prevail'd. <hi>Misery</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi> followed all their Victories; his brought greater Freedom and Felicity to those he overcame. In all they did, they sought to please <hi>themselves;</hi> in all he did, he aimed to please <hi>his Father,</hi> who is God of Gods, <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis this <hi>most Perfect Pattern of Self denial</hi> we
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:006041_0061_0F646EE74E2C1510"/>
must follow, if ever we will come to Glory: To do which, let us consider <hi>Self-denial</hi> in its true Distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Extent.</p>
                  <p>§. VI. There is a <hi>Lawful</hi> and <hi>Unlawful Self,</hi> and both must be denied for the sake of him, that in Submission to the Will of God, counted nothing dear, that he might save us. And tho' the World be scarcely in any part of it at that pass, as yet to need that Lesson of the <hi>Denial of Lawful Self,</hi> that every day most greedily Sacrifices to the pleasure of <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Self:</hi> Yet to take the whole thing before me, and for that it may possibly meet with some that are so far advanced in this Spiritual Warfare, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive some Service from it, I shall at least touch upon it.</p>
                  <p>§. VII The <hi>Lawful Self,</hi> which we are to deny, is that <hi>Conveniency, Ease, Enjoyment and Plenty, which in themselves are so far from being Evil, that they are the Bounty and Blessings of God to us:</hi> As <hi>Husband, Wife, Child, House, Land, Reputation, Liberty and Life it self:</hi> These are God's Favours, which we may enjoy with <hi>lawful</hi> Pleasure, and <hi>justly</hi> improve as our honest Interest. But when God requires them, at what time soever the <hi>Lender</hi> calls for them, or is pleased to try our Affections by our parting with them; I say, when they are brought in Competition with him, they must not be preferr'd, they must be deny'd. Christ himself descended from the Glory of his Father, and willingly made himself of <hi>no Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> among Men, that he might make us of some with God; and from the Quality of thinking it no
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:006041_0062_0F646EE802DD42D8"/>
Robbery to be <hi>Equal</hi> with God, he humbled himself to the poor Form of a <hi>Servant</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Philip. 2. 5, 6, 7, 8.</note>; yea, the Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious <hi>Death of the Cross,</hi> that he might deliver us an Example of <hi>pure Humility</hi> and <hi>entire Submission</hi> to the Will of our Heavenly Father.</p>
                  <p>§. VIII. It is the Doctrine he teaches us in these words<note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 10. 32.</note>: <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother, Son or Daughter, more than me, is not worthy of me.</hi> Again, <hi>Whosoever he be of you, that forsaketh not all that he hath, cannot be my Disciple</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="bottom">Luke 14. 53.</note>. And he plainly told the Young <hi>Rich man,</hi> That if he would have Eternal Life, <hi>he should sell all, and follow him</hi>
                     <note n="**" place="bottom">Mark. 10. 21, 22.</note>: A Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine sad to him, as 'tis to those, that like him (for all their high Pretences to Religion) in truth love their Possessions more than Christ. This Doctrine of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> 'tis the Condition to Eternal Happiness: <hi>He that will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his Cross, and follow me</hi>
                     <note n="††" place="bottom">Mat. 16. 24.</note>. Let him do as I do: As if he had said, He must do as I do, <hi>or he cannot be as I am,</hi> the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>§. IX. This made those honest <hi>Fishermen</hi> quit their Lawful Trades, and follow him, when he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them to it; and others that waited for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation of <hi>Israel,</hi> to offer up their <hi>Estates, Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Liberties,</hi> and also <hi>Lives,</hi> to the Displeasure and Fury of their <hi>Kindred,</hi> and the <hi>Government</hi> they liv'd under, for the Spiritual Advantage that accrew'd to them, by their Faithful Adherence to his holy Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:006041_0063_0F646EE873943D28"/>
True, many would have excus'd their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him in the Parable of the <hi>Feast: Some had bought Land, some had married Wives, and others had bought Yokes of Oxen, and could not come</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="bottom">Luke 14. 13, 14.</note>: that is, an immoderate Love of the World hindred them: Their Lawful Enjoyments, from Servants, became their Idols; they worship'd them more than God, and would not quit them to come to God. But this is Recorded to their Reproach: And we may herein see the Power of <hi>Self</hi> upon the Worldly Man, and the Danger that comes to him by the Abuse of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Things. What thy <hi>Wife</hi> dearer to thee than thy Saviour; And thy <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Oxen</hi> preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy Soul's Salvation! O beware, that thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts prove not Snares first, and then Curses: To over-rate them, is to provoke him that gave them, to take them away again: <hi>Come, and follow him that giveth Life Eternal to the Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. X. Wo to them that have their Hearts in their <hi>Earthly</hi> Possessions! For when they are gone, their Heaven is gone with them. It is too much the Sin of the best part of the World, that they stick in the Comforts of it: And 'tis lamentable to behold how their Affections are bemired, and entangled with their Conveniences and Accommodations in it. The true <hi>Self-denying</hi> Man is a <hi>Pilgrim;</hi> but the <hi>Selfish</hi> Man is an <hi>Inhabitant</hi> of the World: The one uses it, as Men do Ships, to transport themselves, or tackle in a Journey, that is, to get home; the other looks no

further, whatever he prates, than to be fix'd in Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Ease here, and likes it so well, that if he could, he would not exchange. However, he will not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himself to think of the other World, till he is sure he must live no longer in this: But then, alas! 'twill prove too late; not to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but to <hi>Dives,</hi> he must go; the Story is as <hi>true</hi> as <hi>sad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. XI. But on the other hand, it is not for nought, that the Disciples of Jesus deny themselves; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Christ himself had the Eternal Joy in his Eye: <hi>For the Joy that was set before him</hi> (says the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. 12. 2, 3.</note>) <hi>he endured the Cross;</hi> that is, he denied himself, and bore the Reproaches and Death of the Wicked: <hi>And despised the shame,</hi> to wit, the Dishonour and Derision of the World. It made him not afraid or shrink, he contemned it: <hi>And is set down on the Right Hand of the Throne of God.</hi> And to their Encouragement, and great Consolation, when <hi>Peter</hi> asked him, What they should have that had forsaken all to follow him? He answered them, <hi>Verily I say unto you, that ye which have followed me</hi> in the Regeneration, <hi>when the Son of Man shall sit on the Throne of his Glory, ye also shall sit upon Twelve Thrones, judging the Twelve Tribes of Israel</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 19. 27, 28, 29.</note>; that were then in an Apostacy from the Life and Power of Godliness. This was the Lot of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; the more immediate Companions of his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, and first Messengers of his Kingdom. But the next that follows is to all: <hi>And every one that hath
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:006041_0065_0F646EE9F4D8DAB8"/>
forsaken Houses, or Brethren, or Sisters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or Land, or Livings, for my Names sake, shall receive an Hundred fold, and shall inherit Everlasting Life.</hi> 'Twas this Recompence of Reward, this Eternal Crown of Righteousness, that in every Age has raised, in the Souls of the Just, an holy Neglect, yea, Contempt of the World. To this is owing the Constancy of the Martyrs, as to their Blood the Triumph of the Truth.</p>
                  <p>§. XII. Nor is this a new Doctrine; 'tis as old as <hi>Abraham.</hi> In several most Remarkable Instances, his Life was made up of <hi>Self-denial.</hi> First, in quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Land,<note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. 22.</note> where we may well suppose him settled in the midst of Plenty, at least Sufficiency: And why? Because God called him. Indeed this should be Reason enough; but such is the World's Degeneracy, that in Fact it is not: And the same Act, upon the same Inducement, in any now, though prais'd in <hi>Abraham,</hi> would be derided. So apt are People not to understand what they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend; nay, to despise those Actions, when they meet them in the People of their own times, which they pretend to admire in their Ancestors.</p>
                  <p>§. XIII. But he <hi>Obeyed:</hi> The Consequence was, That God gave him a <hi>Mighty Land.</hi> This was the First Reward of his Obedience. The next was, <hi>A Son in his Old Age;</hi> and, which greaten'd the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, after it had been, in Nature, past the time of his Wife's Bearing of Children. Yet God called for
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:006041_0066_0F646EEAF4D99638"/>
his <hi>Darling,</hi> their <hi>only</hi> Child, the Joy of their Age, the Son of a Miracle, and he upon whom the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Promise made to <hi>Abraham</hi> did depend. For this Son, I say, God called: A mighty Trial, that which, one would have thought, might very well have overturned his Faith, and stumbled his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity; at least have put him upon this Dispute in himself: <hi>This Command is Unreasonable and Cruel; 'tis the Tempter's, it cannot be God's. For, is it to be thought that God gave me a Son to make a Sacrifice of him? That the Father should be Butcher of his only Child?</hi> Again, <hi>That he should require me to offer up the Son of his own Promise, by whom his Covenant is to be performed: This is incredible.</hi> I say, Thus <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> might naturally enough have argued, to withstand the Voice of God, and indulge his great Affections to his beloved <hi>Isaac.</hi> But Good Old <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> that knew the Voice that had promised him a Son, had not forgot to know it, when it required him back again: He disputes not, tho' it look'd strange, and perhaps with some surprize and horror, as a Man. He had learn'd to believe, that God that gave him a Child by a Miracle, could work <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother</hi> to preserve or restore him. His Affections could not ballance his Duty, much less overcome his Faith; for he received him in a way that would let him doubt of nothing that God had promis'd of him.</p>
                  <p>To the Voice of this Almightiness he bows, builds an Altar, binds his only Son upon it, kindles the Fire, and stretches forth his hand to take the Knife:
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:006041_0067_0F646EEBADE1BE28"/>
But the Angel stop'd the Stroke, <hi>Hold,</hi> Abraham, <hi>thy Integrity is proved.</hi> What follow'd? A <hi>Ram</hi> serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>Isaac</hi> was his again. This shows how little serves, where <hi>All</hi> is resigned, and how mean a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice contents the Almighty, where the Heart is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. So that 'tis not the Sacrifice that recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the Heart, but the Heart that gives the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice <hi>Acceptance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God often <hi>touches</hi> our best Comforts, and calls for that which we most love, and are least willing to part with. Not that he always take it utterly away, but to prove the Soul's Integrity, to <hi>caution</hi> us from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, and that we may remember God, the Author of those Blessings we possess, and live loose to them. I speak my Experience: The way to <hi>keep</hi> our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, is to <hi>resign them;</hi> and tho' that be hard, 'tis sweet to see them returned, as <hi>Isaac</hi> was to his Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> with more love and Blessing than before. O stupid World! O Worldly Christians! not only Strangers, but Enemies to this Excellent Faith! And whilst so, the Rewards of it you can never know.</p>
                  <p>§. XIV. But <hi>Job</hi> presses hard upon <hi>Abraham:</hi> His <hi>Self-denial</hi> also was very Signal. For when the Messengers of his Afflictions came thick upon him, one Doleful Story after another, till he was left as <hi>naked</hi> as when he was born; the first thing he did, he fell to the Ground, and worship'd that Power, and kiss'd that Hand that strip'd him: So far from mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, that he concludes his Losses of Estate and Children with these words: <hi>Naked came I out of my
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:006041_0068_0F646EEDC85ABF88"/>
Mother's Womb, and naked shall I Return: The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the Name of the Lord</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="bottom">Job 1. 21.</note>. O the deep Faith, Patience, and Contentment of this Excellent Man! one would have thought, this repeated News of Ruine had been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have overset his Confidence in God: But it did not; that stay'd him. But indeed he tells us why: His Redeemer liv'd; <hi>I know</hi> (says he) <hi>that my Redeemer lives</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Job 19. 25, 26.</note> And it appeared he did; for he had Redeemed him from the World: His Heart was not in his Worldly Comforts; his hope lived above the Joys of Time and Troubles of Mortality; not tempted with the one, nor shaken by the other; but firmly believed, <hi>That when those Skin-worms should have consumed his Body, yet with his Eyes, he should see God.</hi> Thus was the Heart of <hi>Job</hi> both submitted, and comforted in the Will of God.</p>
                  <p>§. XV. <hi>Moses</hi> is the next great example in sacred Story for remarkable <hi>Self-denial,</hi> before the times of Christ's appearance in the flesh. He had been saved when an Infant, by an extraordinary Providence, and it seems, by what followed, for an extraordinary ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice<note n="†" place="bottom">Exod. 2. 1,—11.</note>: <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> daughter (whose Compassion was the Means of his Preservation when the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the slaughter of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Males) took him for her son, and gave him the Education of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Court. His own Graceful Presence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Abilities, joyned with her love for him and interest in her Father to promote him, must have
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:006041_0069_0F646EEF339D5D18"/>
rendred him, if not capable of Succession, at least of being chief Minister of Affairs under that wealthy and powerful Prince. For <hi>Egypt</hi> was then what <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> were after, the most famous for Learning, Arts and Glory.</p>
                  <p>§. XVI. But <hi>Moses,</hi> ordained for other work, and guided by a better Star, an higher Principle, no sooner came to Years of Discretion, than the Impiety of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the oppressions of his Brethren there, grew a burden too heavy for him to bear. And though so wise and good a Man could not want those generous and grateful resentments, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the kindness of the Kings Daughter to him; Yet he had also <hi>seen that God that was invisible,</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. 11. 24.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>27.</note> and did not dare to live in the ease and plenty of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> House, whilst his poor Brethren were required <hi>to make Brick without straw.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. 5. 7. 16.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Thus the fear of the Almighty taking deep hold of his heart, he nobly refused to be called the Son of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Daughter, and chose rather a Life of <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction</hi> with the most despised and opprest <hi>Israelites,</hi> and to be the <hi>Companion</hi> of their Temptations, and Jeopardies, <hi>than to enjoy the Pleasures of Sin for a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi> esteeming the Reproaches of Christ (which he suffered for making that unworldly choice) greater Riches than all the Treasures of that Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>§. XVII. Nor was he so foolish as they tho't him; he had reason on his side: For it is said, <hi>He had an Eye to the Recompence of Reward:</hi> He did but refuse
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:006041_0070_0F646EF006133CA0"/>
a lesser Benefit for a greater. In this his Wisdom transcended that of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> for they made the present World their Choice (as uncertain as the Weather) and so lost that which has no end. <hi>Moses</hi> lookt deeper, and weighed the Enjoyments of this Life in the Scales of Eternity, and found they made no weight there. He governed himself not by the immediate possession, but the nature and duration of the Reward. His Faith Corrected his Affections, and taught him to sacrifice the pleasure of <hi>self,</hi> to the hope he had of a future more excellent Recompence.</p>
                  <p>§. XVIII. <hi>Isaiah</hi> was no inconsiderable Instance of this blessed <hi>self-denial;</hi> who of a Courtier became a Prophet,<note n="†" place="bottom">

For his Choice did not only lose him the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of men, but their wickedness, enraged at his Integrity to God, in his frequent and bold reproofs of them, made a <hi>Martyr</hi> of him in the end. For they barbarously saw'd him asunder in the Reign of King <hi>Manasses.</hi> Thus died that Excellent man, and (commonly call'd) the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Prophets.</p>
                  <p>§. XIX. I shall add, of many, one Example more and that is from the Fidelity of <hi>Daniel;</hi> an holy and wise Young-man, that when his external Advantages came in competition with his Duty to Almighty God, he relinquished them all: And instead of being soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous how to secure himself, as one minding nothing less, He was with utmost hazard of <hi>himself,</hi> most
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:006041_0071_0F646EF0ADB821D0"/>
careful how to preserve the honour of God, by his fidelity to his Will. And though at the first it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd him to ruin, yet, as an instance of great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to all, that like him will chuse to keep a good Conscience in an Evil time, at last it advanced him greatly in the World; and the God of <hi>Daniel</hi> was made Famous and Terrible through his <hi>perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> even in the Eyes of Heathen Kings.</p>
                  <p>§. XX. What shall I say of all the rest, who counting nothing dear, that they might do the Will of God <hi>abandon'd</hi> their Worldly Comforts and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed</hi> their Ease and Safety, as often as the Heavenly Vision called them, to the Wrath and Malice of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Princes and an Apostate Church<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus was <hi>Self-Denial</hi> the <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of the Ancients that were Predecessors to the coming of Christ in the flesh: And shall we hope to go to Heaven without it now, when our Saviour himself is become the most excellent <hi>Example</hi> of it? And that not as some would fain have it, <abbr>

There is no room for Instruction, where lawful <hi>Self</hi> is Lord, and not Servant. For <hi>Self</hi> can't receive it: That which should, is apprest by self; fearful and dares not. O what will my <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Mother</hi> say? How will my <hi>Husband</hi> use

me? Or finally what will the <hi>Magistrate</hi> do with me? For though I have a most powerful perswasion, and clear Conviction upon my Soul of this or that thing, yet considering how <hi>unmodish</hi> it is, what Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies it has, and how <hi>Strange</hi> and <hi>Singular</hi> I shall seem to them, I hope God will pity my weakness: If I sink, I am but flesh and blood; may be hereafter he may better enable me; and there is time enough, I will weigh it more thro'ly. Thus Selfish fearful Man.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Deliberating is ever worst;</hi> for the Soul loses in <hi>Parly:</hi> The Manifestation brings <hi>Power</hi> with it. Never did God Convince People, but, upon sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, he impower'd them. He requires nothing without <hi>ability</hi> to perform it: That were <hi>mocking,</hi> not <hi>saving of men.</hi> It is enough for thee to do thy <hi>Duty,</hi> that God <hi>Shews</hi> thee thy Duty; provided thou closest with that Light and Spirit by which he gives thee that knowledge. They that want Power, are such as don't receive Christ in his Convictions upon the Soul; and such will always want it: But such as do, they receive <hi>Power</hi> (like those of old) <hi>to become the Children of God,</hi> through the pure O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Faith.</p>
                  <p>§. XXIII. Wherefore, let me beseech you by the love and Mercy of God, by the Life and Death of Christ, by the Power of his Spirit, and the Hope of Immortality, that you, whose Hearts are esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd in your Temporal Comforts, and so Lovers of <hi>Self</hi> more than of these heavenly things, would <hi>let the time past suffice:</hi> That you would not think
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:006041_0074_0F646EF398D95400"/>
it enough to be clear of such Impieties, as too many are found in, whilst your <hi>Inordinate Love</hi> of lawful things has defil'd your enjoyment of them, and drawn your Hearts from the Fear, Love, Obedience and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial of a true Disciple of <hi>Jesus.</hi> Tack about then, and hearken to the still Voice in thy Conscience; It tells thee thy <hi>Sins,</hi> and of <hi>Misery</hi> in them. It gives a lively Discovery of the very <hi>Vanity</hi> of the World, and opens to thy Soul some prospect of Eternity, and the Comforts of the Just that are at rest. If thou adherest to this, it will Divorce thee from <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Self:</hi> Thou wilt soon find that the Power of its Charms exceed that of the <hi>Wealth, Honour</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and finally will give thee that <hi>Tranquility,</hi> which the Storms of Time can never shipwrack, nor disorder. Here all thine Enjoyments are blest, though small, yet great by that Presence that is within them.</p>
                  <p>Even in this World the Righteous have the better of it; for they use the World without Rebuke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they don't abuse it. They see and bless the Hand that feeds, and cloaths, and preserves them. And as by beholding Him in all his Gifts, they don't Adore them, but him; so the sweetness of his Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings that gives them, is an advantage such have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those that see him not. Besides, in their <hi>Increase</hi> they are not lifted up, nor in their <hi>Adversities</hi> are they cast down: And why? Because they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated in the one, and comforted in the other, by his Divine Presence.</p>

In short, Heaven is the Throne, &amp; the Earth but the Footstool of that man that hath <hi>Self</hi> under Foot. And those that know that Station will not easily be moved.

§. I. I Am now come to <hi>Unlawful Self,</hi> which, more or less, is the immediate Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of much the greater part of Mankind. This <hi>Unlawful Self</hi> is twofold. 1st, <hi>That which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to Religious Worship:</hi> 2dly, <hi>That which concerns Moral and Civil Conversation in the World.</hi> And they are both of infinite Consequence to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us.

                  <p>§. II. That <hi>Unlawful Self</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> that ought to be mortified by the Cross of Christ, is <hi>Man's Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Performance of Worship to God, as Divine; which is not so, either in its Institution or Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> In this great Error, those People have the <hi>Van,</hi> of all, that attribute to themselves the Name of <hi>Christians,</hi> that are most <hi>Exteriour, Pompous,</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious</hi> in their <hi>Worship:</hi> For they do not only miss exceedingly by a Spiritual Unpreparedness in the way of their performing <hi>Worship</hi> to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who is an Eternal Spirit; but the <hi>Worship</hi> it self is composed of what is utterly inconsistent with the very Form and Practice of Christ's Doctrine, and the Apostolical Example.

with a <hi>Worship</hi> to please him, but to make one to please themselves. A <hi>Worship</hi> dress'd with such <hi>Stately Buildings</hi> and <hi>Imagery, Rich Furnitures</hi> and <hi>Garments, rare Voices</hi> and <hi>Musicks, costly Lamps, Wax-Candles</hi> and <hi>Perfumes;</hi> and all acted with that most pleasing Variety to the External Senses, that Art can invent, or Cost procure: As if the World were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>§. IV.

Men may sooner knock their Brains out with them, than their sins: And that, I fear, too many of them know in their very Consciences that use them, indeed, <hi>Adore</hi> them, and (which can only hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the <hi>false Cross</hi>) are proud of them too, since the true one leaves no Pride, where it is truly born.</p>
                  <p>§. X. For as their Religion, so their <hi>Cross,</hi> is very <hi>Gawdy</hi> and <hi>Triumphant:</hi> But in what? In <hi>precious Metals</hi> and <hi>Gems,</hi> the spoil of Superstition upon the Peoples Pocket. These <hi>Crosses</hi> are made of Earthly Treasure instead of Learning their Hearts that wear them to deny it: And like men, they are respected by their <hi>Finery.</hi> A Rich <hi>Cross</hi> shall have many Gazers and Admirers; the mean, in this, as other things, are more neglected. I could appeal to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of this great Vanity and Superstition. O! how very short is this of the blessed <hi>Cross</hi> of <hi>Jesus</hi> that <hi>takes away the sins of the World!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. XI. Nor is a <hi>Recluse Life,</hi> (the boasted Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of some) much more commendable, or one whit nearer to the nature of the true <hi>Cross:</hi> For if it be not Unlawful as other things are, 'tis <hi>Unnatural,</hi> which true Religion teaches not. The <hi>Christian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi> and <hi>Monastery are within,</hi> where the Soul is <hi>encloistered</hi> from <hi>Sin.</hi> And this <hi>Religious House</hi> the

true Followers of Christ <hi>carry about</hi> with them, who exempt not themselves from the Conversation of the World, though they keep themselves from the evil of the World in their <hi>Conversation.</hi> That is a <hi>lazy rusty unprofitable Self-denial,</hi> burdensome to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to feed Idleness: <hi>Religious Bedlams,</hi> where their People are kept up left they should do mischief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: <hi>Patience per force:</hi> Self-denial against their will, rather ignorant than Virtuous; and out of the way of <hi>Temptation,</hi> than constant in it. No thanks if they commit not, what they are not tempted to, commit. <hi>What the Eye views not, the Heart craves not, as well as rues not,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. XII. The C<hi>ross of Christ</hi> is of another nature: It truly overcomes the World, and leads a <hi>Life of Purity</hi> in the face of its <hi>Allurements:</hi> They that bear it, are not <hi>thus</hi> chained up, for fear they should <hi>bite;</hi> nor <hi>lockt up,</hi> left they should be stole away: No, they receive Power from Christ their Captain, to resist the <hi>Evil,</hi> and do that which is <hi>Good</hi> in the sight of God; to despise the World, and love its <hi>reproach</hi> above its <hi>Praise:</hi> And not only not to offend others, but love those that offend them, though not for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, them. What a World should we have, if every Body for fear of <hi>Transgressing</hi> should <hi>mew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self up within four Walls?</hi> No such matter; The <hi>Perfection</hi> of Christian Life extends to every honest Labour or Traffick used among men. This <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> is not the Effect of Christ's free Spirit, but a <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, Fleshly, Humility;</hi> meer <hi>Trammels</hi> of their

own making and putting on, without prescription of reason. In all which, 'tis plain, they are their own <hi>Law-givers</hi> and set their own <hi>Rule, Mulct</hi> and <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som:</hi> A constrained <hi>Harshness,</hi> out of joynt to the rest of the Creation: For <hi>Society</hi> is one great end of it, and not to be destroyed for fear of <hi>Evil;</hi> but <hi>sin</hi> banish'd that spoils it, by steady <hi>Reproof,</hi> and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous Example of tryed <hi>Vertue.</hi> True <hi>Godliness</hi> don't turn men out of the <hi>World,</hi> but enables them to live better in it, and excites their Endeavours to mend it: <hi>Not hide their Candle under a Bushel, but set it upon a Table in a Candlestick.</hi> Besides, 'tis a Selfish Invention; and that can never be the way of taking up the <hi>Cross,</hi> which the true <hi>Cross</hi> is therefore <hi>taken up</hi> to subject. But again, this <hi>humour</hi> runs away by it self, and leaves the <hi>World</hi> behind to be <hi>lost: Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> should <hi>keep</hi> the Helm, and <hi>guide</hi> the Vessel to its <hi>Port;</hi> not meanly steal out at the <hi>Stern</hi> of the World, and leave those that are in it, without a <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,</hi> to be driven by the Fury of <hi>Evil Times</hi> upon the <hi>Rock</hi> or <hi>Sand</hi> of <hi>Ruin.</hi> In fine, this sort of Life, if taken up by <hi>Young People,</hi> is commonly to cover <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleness,</hi> or to pay <hi>Portions;</hi> to save the Lazy from the pain of <hi>Punishment,</hi> or Quality from the disgrace of <hi>Poverty:</hi> One won't work, and the other scorns it. If <hi>Aged,</hi> a long Life of <hi>Guilt</hi> sometimes flies to <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition</hi> for a Refuge; and after having had its own Will in other things, would finish it in a <hi>wilful</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to make God <hi>amends.</hi>

The Thoughts of Man's Heart are evil, and that continually.

What benefit to the Mind to have it for a Punishment, and not a Pleasure? Nay, I have long thought it an Error among all sorts, that use not <hi>Monastick</hi> Lives, that they have no <hi>Retreats</hi> for the <hi>Afflicted,</hi> the <hi>Tempted,</hi> the <hi>Solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and the <hi>Devout;</hi> where they might undisturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly wait upon God, pass through their Religious Exercises; and, being thereby strengthened, may with more power over their own Spirits enter into the Business of the World again; tho' the less the better to be sure.

                     <hi>Paul</hi> teaches; much more in their Worship to their Creator and Redeemer. And whatever Prayer be made or Doctrine be uttered, and not from the Preparation of the Holy Spirit, it is not acceptable with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor can it be the true Evangelical Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which is in <hi>Spirit and Truth;</hi> that is, by the Preparation and Aid of the Spirit.

them to the Invisible God; by no means: They are for the sake of the Congregation. 'Tis the Language of the Soul, God hears; nor can that speak, but by the Spirit; or Groan aright to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, without the Assistance of it.</p>
                  <p>§. IV. The Soul of Man however lively in other things, is dead to God, till he breathe the <hi>Spirit of Life</hi> in it: It cannot live to him, much less worship him, without it. Thus God, by <hi>Ezekiel</hi> tells us, when in a Vision of the Restoration of Mankind, in the Person of Israel, (an usual Way of speaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Prophets,<note n="†" place="bottom">Ezek. 37. 12, 13, 14.</note> and as often mistaken) <hi>I will open your Graves (saith the Lord) and put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live.</hi> So tho' Christ taught his Disciples to Pray, they were, in some sort, Disciples before he taught them; not Worldly Men, whose Prayers are an Abomination to God. And his Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, is not an Argument that every body must say that Prayer, whether he can say it with the same Heart, and under the same Qualifications, as his poor Disciples&amp;Followers did, as is now too Superstitiously and Presumptuously practised. But rather, that as they <hi>then</hi> so we now, are not to pray our own Prayers, but his; that is, such as he Enables us to make, as he Enabled them then.</p>
                  <p>§. V. For if we are <hi>not to take Thought what we shall say</hi> when we come before Worldly Princes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it shall then <hi>be given us</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 10. 19, 20.</note>; and that it is <hi>not we that speak, but the Spirit of our heavenly Father that Speaketh in us;</hi> much less can our Ability be

needed or ought we to study to our selves Forms of Speech in our Approaches to the Great Prince of Princes, <hi>King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 6.</note>. For be it his Greatness, we ought not by Christ's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: Be it our Relation to him, as Children, we need not: He will help us, he is our Father; that is, if he be so indeed. Thus not only the Mouth of the Body, but of the Soul, is shut, till God opens it; and then he loves to hear the Language of it. In which the Body ought never to go before the Soul: His Ear is open to such Requests, and his Spirit strongly interceeds for those that offer them.</p>
                  <p>§. VI. But it may be ask'd, <hi>How shall this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration be obtained?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Answer; By Waiting Patiently, yet Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and Intently upon God: <hi>Lord</hi> (says the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist<note n="*" place="bottom">Psal. 10. 17.</note>) <hi>thou hast heard the Desire of the Humble; thou wilt</hi> prepare <hi>their Heart, thou wilt cause thine Ear to hear:</hi> And (says Wisdom<note n="‖" place="bottom">Prov. 16. 1.</note>) <hi>The</hi> Preparation <hi>of the Heart in Man is from the Lord.</hi> Here it is thou must not think thy own Thoughts, nor speak thy own Words, (which indeed is the Silence of the Holy Cross) but be sequestred from all the confused Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, that are apt to throng and press upon the Mind in those holy Retirements. It is not for thee to think to overcome the Almighty by the most Composed Matter, cast into the aptest Phrase: No, no; One Groan, one Sigh from a Wounded Soul, an Heart touch'd with true Remorse, a sincere
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:006041_0094_0F646F062A01E030"/>
and godly Sorrow, which is the Work of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, excells and prevails with God. Wherefore stand still in thy Mind, wait to feel something that is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, to prepare and dispose thee to Worship God truly and acceptably. And thus taking up the Cross, and shutting the Doors and Windows of the Soul against every thing that would interrupt this Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God, how pleasant soever the Object be in it self, how lawful or needful at another season, the Power of the Almighty will break in, his Spirit will work and prepare the Heart, that it may offer up an Acceptable Sacrifice. 'Tis he that discovers and presses Wants upon the Soul; and when it cries, it is he alone that supplies them.

                     <note n="‖" place="bottom">John 5. 2, 3, 4.</note> about the Pool of <hi>Bethesda.</hi> 
                     <q>There is at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> by the Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Market, a Pool, which is called in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, <hi>Bethesda,</hi> having five Porches; in these lay a great multitude of Impotent Folks, of Blind, Halt, and Withered, <hi>Waiting</hi> for the moving of
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:006041_0107_0F646F102D651030"/>
the Water. For an Angel went down at a certain season into the Pool, and troubled the Water: Whosoever then first, after the troubling of the Water, step'd in, was made whole of whatsoever Disease he had—</q> A most exact Representation of what is intended by all that has been said upon the Subject of <hi>Waiting.</hi> For as there was then an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Legal, so there is now a Gospel and spiritual <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the Church of God, consisting of the Faithful. The Pool in that old <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> in some sort, represented that Fountain, which is now set o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in this <hi>New Jerusalem.</hi> That Pool was for those that were under Infirmities of Body; this Fountain for all that are Impotent in Soul. There was an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel then that moved the Water, to render it Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial; it is God's Angel now, the <hi>great Angel of his Presence,</hi> that blesseth this Fountain with success. They that then went in before, and did not watch the Angel, and take advantage of his Motion, found no benefit of their stepping in: Those that now <hi>wait</hi> not the <hi>moving</hi> of God's Angel, but by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of their own forming and timing, rush, before God, as the Horse into the Battle, and hope for Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, are sure to Miscarry in their Expectation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as then, They <hi>Waited</hi> with all Patience and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention upon the Angel's Motion, that wanted and desired to be Cured; so do the true Worshippers of God now, that need and pray for his Presence, which is the Life of their Souls, as the Sun is to the Plants of the Field. They have often tried the Unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:006041_0108_0F646F10FA519C78"/>
of their own Work, and are now come to the Sabbath indeed. They dare not put up a Device of their own, or offer an unsanctified Request, much less obtrude bodily Worship, where the Soul is really unsensible or unprepared by the Lord. In the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Jesus</hi> they ever <hi>wait</hi> to be Prepared, Retired, and Recluse from all Thoughts that cause the least De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and Discomposure in the Mind, till they see the Angel move, and till their Beloved please to wake: Nor dare they call him before his time. And they fear to make a Devotion in his absence; for they know it is not only Unprofitable, but Reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? <q>Who has required this at your hands? He that believes, makes not haste.</q>

Alas!

often names the Name of Jesus, yea, bows the Knee to it too, but <hi>departs not from Iniquity:</hi> This is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable to God.</p>
                  <p>§. XIII. In short, there are Four Things so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Worshipping of God aright, and which puts its Performance beyond Man's Power, that there seems little more needed than the naming of them. The First is, <hi>The Sanctification of the Worshipper.</hi> Secondly, <hi>The Consecration of the Offering,</hi> which has been spoken to before somewhat largely. Thirdly, <hi>What to pray for;</hi> which no Man knows, that prays not by the Aid of God's Spirit; and therefore, without that Spirit no Man can truly pray. This the Apostle puts beyond Dispute<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 8. 26.</note>. <q>We know not(says he) what we should <hi>Pray</hi> for, as we ought, but the Spirit help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our Infirmities.</q> Men unacquainted with the Work and Power of the Holy Spirit, are ignorant of the Mind of God; and those, certainly, can never please him with their Prayers. It is not enough to know, we want; but we should learn, whether it be not sent us as a Blessing: Disappointments to the Proud, Losses to the Covetous; and to the Negligent, Stripes: To remove these, were to secure the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, not help the Salvation of the Soul.</p>
                  <p>The vile World knows nothing, but Carnally, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a fleshly Manner and Interpretation; and too many that would be tho't enlightned, are apt to call Providences by wrong Names. For Instance, Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions they stile Judgments; and Trials (more precious
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:006041_0110_0F646F129391FE98"/>
than the beloved Gold) they call Miseries. On the other hand, they call the Preferments of the World by the Name of Honour, and its Wealth, Happiness; when for once that they are so, 'tis much to be feared, they are sent of God an hundred times for Judgments, at least Trials, upon their Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors. Therefore What to Keep, What to Reject, What to Want, is a Difficulty God only can resolve the Soul. And since God knows, better than we, what we need, he can better tell us what to ask, than we can him: Which made Christ exhort his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to avoid long and repetitious Prayers; telling them, That <q>their heavenly Father knew what they needed, before they ask'd:</q>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 6. 7, 8.</note> And therefore gave them a Pattern to pray by; not as some fancy, to be a Text for Humane Liturgies, which of all Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices are most justly noted and taxed for length and repetition; but expresly to reprove and avoid them. But if those Wants that are the subject of Prayer, were once agreed upon (tho' that be a mighty Point) yet <hi>how to pray,</hi> is still of greater moment, than to pray; 'tis not the Request, but the Frame of the Petitioners Spirit. The <hi>What</hi> may be proper, but the <hi>How</hi> defective. As I said, God needs not be told of our Wants by us, who must tell them to us; yet he will be told them from us, that both we may seek him, and he may come down to us. But when this is done,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Isa. 66. 2.</note> 
                     <q>To that Man will I look, faith the Lord, even to him that is poor and of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite

Spirit, and that trembleth at my Word.</q> To the sick Heart, the wounded Soul, the hungry and thirsty, the weary and heavy laden Ones; such sinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erely want an Helper.</p>
                  <p>§. XIV. Nor is this sufficient to compleat <hi>Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Worship;</hi> the Fourth Requisite must be had, and that is <hi>Faith, True</hi> Faith, <hi>Precious</hi> Faith, the <hi>Faith</hi> of God's Chosen, that <hi>Purifies</hi> their Hearts, that <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomes</hi> the World, <hi>and is the Victory</hi> of the Saints.<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Tim. 1. 5.

Tit. 1. 1. 2 Pet. 1. 1. 1 John 5. 4.</note> This is that which animates Prayer, and presses it home, like the Importunate Widow, that would not be denied; to whom Christ (seeming to admire) said,<note n="*" place="bottom">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. 15. 28.</note> 'O Woman, great is thy Faith.' This is of highest Moment on our part, to give our Addresses success with God; and yet not our Power neither, for it is the Gift of God; From him we must have it; and with one Grain of it, more Work is done, more Deliverance is wrought, and more Goodness and Mercy received, than by all the Runnings, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and Toilings of Man, with his Inventions and Bodily Exercises. Which duly weighed, will easily spell out the meaning, why so much Worship should bring so little Profit to the World, as we see it does, <abbr>

<pb n="88" facs="unknown:006041_0112_0F646F13EA6725F8"/>
wrestled with God and prevailed. And the truth is, the generality are yet in their Sins, following their Hearts Lusts, and living in Worldly Pleasure, being Strangers to this Precious Earth. It is the Reason rendred by the deep Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> of the unprofitableness of the <hi>Word Preached</hi> to some of those days; <hi>Not being</hi>(faith he)<hi>mixed with</hi> Faith <hi>in them that heard it.</hi> Can the Minister then Preach without Faith? No; and much less can any Man Pray to purpose without Faith, especially when we are told, <hi>That the Just live by Faith.</hi> For Worship is the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Act of Man's Life; and whatever is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to inferior Acts of Religion, must not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there.</p>
                  <p>§. XV. This may moderate the Wondor in any, why Christ so often upbraided his Disciples with, <hi>O ye of little Faith!</hi> Yet tells us, That one Grain of it (though as little as that of Mustard, one of the least of Seeds) if true and right, is able to remove Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. As if he had said, There is no Temptation so powerful, that it cannot supply: Wherefore those that are captivated by Temptations, and remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supplied in their Spiritual Wants, have not this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Faith: That's the true Cause. So necessary was it of old, that Christ did not many mighty Works where the People believed not; and tho' his Power wrought Wonders in other places, Faith open'd the way: So that 'tis hard to say, whether that Power by Faith, or Faith by that Power, wrought the Cure. Let us call to mind what Famous Things a little

                  <p>§. XVII. But some may say, What is this Faith, that is so necessary to Worship, and that gives it such acceptance with God, and returns that Benefit to Men? I say, <q>It is an Holy Resignation to God, and confidence in him, testified by a Religious O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his holy Requirings, which gives sure E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to the Soul of the things not yet seen, and a general Sense and Taste of the Substance of those things that are hoped for; that is, the Glory which is to be revealed hereafter.</q> As this Faith is the Gift of God, so it <hi>purifies</hi> the Hearts of those that receive it.

HAving thus discharged my Conscience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that part of <hi>Unlawful Self,</hi> that fain would be a Christian, a Believer, a Saint, whilst a plain Stranger to the <hi>Cross</hi> of Christ, and the holy Exercises of it; and in that briefly discovered what is true Worship, and the use and business of the holy Cross, therein to render its performance pleasing to Almighty God; I shall now (the same Lord assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me) more largely prosecute that other part of <hi>Unlawful Self,</hi> which fills the Study, Care, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation of the World, presented to us in these three Capital Lusts, that is to say,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pride Avarice,</hi> and <hi>Luxury:</hi> From whence all other Mischiefs daily flow, as Streams from their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Fountains: The Mortifying of which, makes

up the other; and indeed a very great part of the Work of the true Cross; and tho' last in place, yet first in Experience and Duty: Which done, it Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in the room of those Evil Habits, the blessed Effects of that so much needed Reformation, to wit, Mortification, Humility, Temperance, Love, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Heavenly-mindedness,<note n="†" place="bottom">Gal. 5. 22. 23.</note> with all other Graces of the Spirit, becoming the Followers of the Perfect Jesus that most heavenly Man.</p>
                  <p>The Care and Love of all Mankind are either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to God or Themselves. Those that love God above all, are ever humbling <hi>Self</hi> to his Commands, and only love Self in subserviency to him that is Lord of all. But those that are declin'd from that Love to God, are Lovers of themselves, more than God: For supream Love must center in one of these two. To that inordinate Self-Love, the Apostle rightly joins <hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>High minded.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. 3. 2, 3.</note> For no sooner had the Angels declin'd their Love, Duty and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to God, than they inordinately loved and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued themselves; which made them exceed their Station, and aspire above the order of their Creation. This was their Pride, and this sad Defection their Dismal Fall; who are reserv'd in Chains of Darkness unto the Judgment of the Great Day of God.</p>
                  <p>§. II. <hi>Pride,</hi> that Pernicious Evil, which begins this Chapter, did also begin the Misery of Mankind: A most Mischievous Quality; and so commonly known by its Motions, and sad Effects, that every
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:006041_0118_0F646F1A71B31560"/>
Unmortified Breast carries its Definition in it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I will say, in short, <hi>That</hi> Pride <hi>is an Excess of Self Love, join'd with an undervalue of others, and desire of Dominion over them:</hi> The most troublesome thing in the World. There are four things, by which it hath made it self best known to Mankind, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of which hath bro't an equal Misery to its Evil. The First is, <hi>An Inordinate Pursuit of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> The Second, <hi>An ambitious craving and seeking after Power.</hi> The Third, <hi>An Extream Desire of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Respect and Deference.</hi> The last Excess is that of <hi>Worldly Furniture and Ornaments.</hi> To the just and true Witness of the Eternal God, plac'd in the Souls of all People, I appeal as to the Truth of these things.</p>
                  <p>§. III. To the First, 'Tis plain, that an <hi>Inordinate Desire of Knowledge</hi> introduced Man's Misery, and brought an Universal Lapse from the Glory of his Primitive State. <hi>Adam</hi> would needs be wiser than God had made him. It did not serve his turn to know his Creator, and give him that holy Homage, his Being and Innocency, naturally engaged and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited him to; nor to have an <q>
                        <note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. 2. 19, 20.</note> Understanding above all the Beasts of the Field, the Fowls of the Air, and the Fishes of the Sea,</q> joined with a Power to Rule over all the visible Creation of God; but he must be as wise as God too.<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. 3. 5.</note> This Unwarrantable Search, and as Foolish as Unjust Ambition, made him unworthy of the Blessings he received from God. This drives him out of <hi>Paradise</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="bottom">Ch. 3. 24.</note>; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:006041_0119_0F646F1ADF825C48"/>
of being Lord of the whole World, <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the wretchedest Vagabond of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>§. IV. A Strange Change! That instead of being as Gods, they should fall below the very Beasts; in comparison of whom, even God had made them as Gods. The Lamentable Consequence of this great Defection has been an Exchange of Innocency for Guilt, and a <hi>Paradise</hi> for a Wilderness. But, which is yet more worse, in this State <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had got another God than the only True and Living God: And he that had enticed them to all this Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, furnished them with a Vain Knowledge, and Pernicious Wisdom: The Skill of Lyes and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, Shifts, Evasions, and Excuses.—They had lost their Plainness and Sincerity; and from an Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Heart, the Image in which God had made Man, he became a Crooked, Twining, Twisting Serpent; the Image of that Unrighteous Spirit to whose Temptations he yielded up with his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, his Paradisical Happiness.</p>
                  <p>§. V. Nor is this limited to <hi>Adam;</hi> for all, who have <hi>fallen short of the Glory of God,</hi> are right born Sons of his Disobedience. They, like him have eaten of what they have been forbidden: They have <q>Committed the things they ought not to have done, and left undone the things they ought to have done.</q>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 7.</note> They have sinned against that Divine Light of Knowledge, which God has given them: They have grieved his Spirit; and that Dismal Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:006041_0120_0F646F1B6D046618"/>
has been executed,<note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. 2. 13.</note> 
                     <q>In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt dye.</q> That is, when thou dost the thing which thou oughtest not to do, thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> no more live in my Favour and enjoy the Comforts of the Peace of my Spirit: Which is a dying to all these Innocent and Holy Desires and Affections, which God created Man with; and he becomes as one Cold and Benumbed; insensible of the Love of God, of his Holy Spirit, Power and Wisdom; of the Light and Joy of his Countenance, and the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a good Conscience, and the Co-witnessing and Approbation of God's Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>§. VI. So that fallen <hi>Adam's</hi> Knowledge of God stood no more in a daily Experience of the Love and Work of God in his Soul, but in a Notion of what he once did know and experience: Which being not the true and living Wisdom, that is from above, but a meer Picture, it cannot preserve Man in purity; but puffs up, makes People Proud, High-minded, and Impatient of Contradiction. This was the state of the Apostate <hi>Jews</hi> before Christ came; and has been the Condition of Apostate Christians ever since he came: Their Religion standing (some Bodily Performances excepted) either in what they once knew, of the Work of God in themselves, and which they have revolted from; or in an Historical Belief, and an Imaginary Conception and Paraphrase upon the Experiences and Prophecies of such holy Men and Women of God, as in all Ages have deserved the Stile and Character of his true Children.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="unknown:006041_0121_0F646F1DEAE199A0"/>
§. VII. As such a Knowledge of God cannot be true, so by Experience we find, that it ever brings forth the quite contrary Fruits to the true Wisdom. For as that is first <hi>Pure,</hi> then <hi>Peaceable,</hi> then <hi>Gentle,</hi> and <hi>Easie to be intreated:</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>m. 3. 17.</note> so the Knowledge of Degenerated and Unmortified Men is first Impure: For it came by the Commission of Evil, and is held in an Evil and Impure Conscience and Heart, that disobey God's Law, and that daily do those things which they ought not to do; and for which they stand Condemned before God's Judgment-Seat in the Souls of Men: The Light of whose Presence searches the most hidden things of Darkness, the most secret Thoughts, and concealed Inclinations of Ungodly Men. This is the Science, falsly so called; and as it is Impure, so 'tis Unpeaceable, Cross, and hard to be intreated; Froward, Perverse, and Persecuting; Jealous that any should be better than they, and hating and abusing those that are.</p>
                  <p>§. VIII. 'Twas this Pride made <hi>Cain</hi> a Murderer: 'Tis a spiteful Quality; full of Envy and Revenge. What! was not his <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> as good as his Brother's<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. 4. 8.</note>? He had all the Exterior Parts of Worship; he offered as well as <hi>Abel;</hi> and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of it self might be as good: But is seems the Heart, that offered it, was not. So long ago did God regard the Interior Worship of the Soul. Well! what was the Consequence of this Difference? <hi>Cain's</hi> Pride stomach'd it: He could not bear to be
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:006041_0122_0F646F1E7255F0C8"/>
out-done by his Brother. He grew Wrathful, and resolved to Vindicate his Offering, by Revenging the Refusal of it upon his Brother's Life: And without any regard to Natural Affection, or the low and early Condition of Mankind, he Barbarously Dy'd his hands in his Brother's Blood.</p>
                  <p>§. IX. The Religion of the Apostatiz'd <hi>Jews</hi> did no better; for, having lost the <hi>Inward Life,</hi> Power and Spirit of the Law (they were puff'd up with that Knowledge they had; and their pretences to <hi>Abraham, Moses,</hi> and the Promises of God, in that frame, served only to blow them up into an unsuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable Pride, Arrogancy and Cruelty. For they could not bear true Vision, when it came to visit them, and entertain'd the Messengers of their Peace as if they had been Wolves and Tygers.</p>
                  <p>§. X. Yet, 'tis remarkable, the false Prophets, the great Engineers against the True Ones, were ever sure to persecute them as False; and, by their Interest with Earthly Princes, or the poor seduced Multitude, made them the Instruments of their Malice. Thus 'twas that one holy Prophet was sawn asunder, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stoned to Death, &amp;c. So Proud and Obstinate is False Knowledge, and the Aspirers after it: Which made holy <hi>Stephen</hi> cry out,<note n="*" place="bottom">Afts. 7. 51.</note> 
                     <q>O ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in Heart and Ear, ye resist the Holy Ghost; as did your Fathers, so do ye.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. XI. The true Knowledge came with the Joy of Angels, singing <hi>Peace to the Earth, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will

                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 2. 14.</note>: The False Knowledge enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the Message with Calumnies: Christ must needs be an <hi>Impostor:</hi> and that must prove him so, to wit, his Power of working of <hi>Miracles;</hi> which was that which proved the contrary. They stoned him, and frequently sought to kill him; which at last they wickedly accomplish'd. But what was their Motive to it? Why, he cried out against their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, the Broad Phylacteries, the Honour they sought of Men. To be short, they give the Reason themselves in these words<note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 21.</note>; <q>If we take not some Course with him, the People will follow him:</q> That is, he will take away our Credit with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; they will adhere to him, and desert us; and so we shall lose our Power and Reputation with the Multitude.</p>
                  <p>§. XII. And, the Truth is, he came to Level their Honour, to overthrow their Rabbiship, and by his Grace to bring the People to that <hi>Inward Knowledge</hi> of God, which they, by Transgression, were departed from; that so they might see the Deceitfulness of their Blind Guides, who by their vain Traditions, had made void the Righteousness of the Law; and who were so far from Being the true Doctors, and lively Expounders of it, that in Reality they were the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devil, who was a Proud Lyar, and cruel Murtherer, from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>§. XIII. Their Pride in False Knowledge having made them uncapable of receiving the Simplicity of
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:006041_0124_0F646F1FEF4F4848"/>
the Gospel, Christ <q>thanks his Father, that he had hid the Mysteries of it from the Wife and Prudent, and revealed them to Babes</q>.<note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 11. 25.</note> It was this False Wisdom swell'd the Minds of the <hi>Athenians</hi> to that Degree, that they despised the Preaching of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Paul</hi> as a vain and foolish thing. But that Apostle, who, of all the rest, had an Education in the Learning of those Times, bitterly reflects on that Wisdom, so much valued by <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks;</hi> 
                     <q>Where (says he<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 1. 20.</note>) is the Wife? Where is the Scribe? Where is the Disputer of this World? Hath not God made Foolish the Wisdom of this World?</q> And he gives a good Reason for it,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Vers. 29.</note> 
                     <q>That no Flesh should Glory in his presence.</q> Which is to say, God will stain the Pride of Man in False Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that he should have nothing on this occasion to be proud of: It should be owing only to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Spirit of God. The Apostle goes further, and affirms<note n="‡" place="bottom">ib. v. 21.</note> 
                     <q>That the World by Wisdom knew not God.</q> That is, It was so far from an Help, that, as Men use it, it was an Hindrance to the true Knowledge of God. And in his First E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to his Beloved <hi>Timothy,</hi> he concludes thus<note n="**" place="bottom">1 Tim. 6. 20.</note>: <q>
                        <hi>O Timothy!</hi> Keep that which is committed to thy Trust, avoiding profane and vain Babblings, and Oppositions of Science, falsly so called.</q> This was the sense of Apostolical Times, when the Divine Grace gave the true Knowledge of God, and was the Guide of Christians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="unknown:006041_0125_0F646F20AAABEB70"/>
§. XIV. Well! But what has been the success of those Ages, that followed the Apostolical; Any whit better than that of the Jewish Times? Not one Jot. They have exceeded them; as with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to greater Knowledge, so in their degeneracy from the true <hi>Christian Life;</hi> For tho' they had a more Excellent Pattern than the Jews, to whom he spoke by <hi>Moses</hi> his Servant, he speaking to them by his <hi>Beloved Son, the Express Image of his Substance,</hi> the Perfection of all Meekness and Humility. And tho' they seemed Addicted to nothing more than an Adoration of his Name, and a Veneration to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his blessed Disciples and Apostles; yet so great was their Defection from the Inward Power and Life of Christianity in the Soul, that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect was little more than Formal and Ceremonious. For notwithstanding they, like the <hi>Jews,</hi> were mighty Zealous in <hi>Garnishing their Sepulchres,</hi> and Curious in <hi>Carving of their Images;</hi> not only keeping with any pretence what might be the Relicts of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but recommending a thousand things as Relicts, which are purely Fabulous, and very often Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and to be sure altogether <hi>Unchristian:</hi> Yet as to the great and weighty things of the Christian Law, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Love, Meekness, and Self-denial, they were degenerated: They grew <q>High-minded, Proud, Boasters, without Natural Affection, Curious, and Controversial; ever perplexing the Church with doubtful and dubious Questions; filling the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with Disputations, Strife and Wrangling, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:006041_0126_0F646F2169691300"/>
them into Parties,</q> till at last they fell into Blood: As if they had been the worse for being once Christians.</p>
                  <p>O the Miserable State of these pretended Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans! That instead of Christ's, and his Apostles Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, of <hi>Loving Enemies,</hi> and <hi>Blessing them that Curse them,</hi> they should teach the People, under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christian Zeal, most Inhumanely to Butcher one another; and instead of suffering their own Blood to be shed for the Testimony of Jesus, they should shed the Blood of the Witnesses of Jesus, for Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. Thus that subtil Serpent, or Crafty, Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that tempted <hi>Adam</hi> out of his Innocency, and the Jews from the Law of God, has beguil'd the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, by Lying Vanities, to depart from the Christian Law of Holiness, and so they are become Slaves to him: For <q>he rules in the Hearts of all the Children of Disobedience.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. XV. And it is observable, that as Pride (which is ever followed by Superstition and Obstinacy) put <hi>Adam</hi> upon seeking an Higher Station than God placed him in; and as the Jews, out of the same Pride, to out-do their Pattern given them of God by <hi>Moses</hi> upon the Mount, <hi>set their Post by God's Post, and taught for Doctrines their own Traditions,</hi> in so much that those that refused Conformity to them, ran the hazard of Crucifie, crucifie: So the Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Christians, from the same Sin of Pride, with great Superstition and Arrogance, have introduced, instead of a Spiritual Worship and Discipline; that which is
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:006041_0127_0F646F226BACADE8"/>
evidently Ceremonious and Worldly <hi>I</hi> with such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations and Traditions of Men, as are the fruit of the Wisdom that is from below: Witness their Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and Perplext Councels and Creeds, with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form or Burn, at the end of them.</p>
                  <p>§. XVI. And as this Unwarrantable Pride set them first at work to pervert the Spirituality of the Christian Cult, making it rather to resemble the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy Religion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Gawdy Worship of the <hi>AEgyptians,</hi> than the great Plainness and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Christian Institution, which is neither to resemble that of the Mountain, nor the other of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> so has the same Pride and Arrogancy spur'd them on, by all imaginable Cruelties, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this great <hi>Diana</hi> of theirs. No meek Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor humble Remonstrances of those that keep close to Primitive Purity in Worship and Doctrine, could prevail with these Nominal Christians to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense with the Imposition of their Un-Apostolical Traditions. But as the Ministers and Bishops of these degenerate Christians left their painful Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Care over Christ's Flock and grew Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Covetous and Luxurious, resembling rather worldly Potentates, than the Humble-spirited and Mortified Followers of the Blessed Jesus; so almost every History tells us, with what Pride and Cruelty, Blood and Butchery, and that with unusual and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit Tortures, they have persecuted the holy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ out of the World: and that upon such <hi>Anathema's,</hi> that, as far as they could, they
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:006041_0128_0F646F22EFC26120"/>
have disappointed them of the Blessings of Heaven too. These, true Christians call Martyrs, but the Clergy like the persecuting <hi>Jews,</hi> have stil'd them Blasphemers and Hereticks: In which they have fulfilled the Prophecy of our Lord Jesus Christ; who did not say, that they should think they do the Gods good Service to kill the Christians, his dear Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (which might refer to the Persecutions of the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Gentiles) but <q>that they should think they do God good Service to kill them<note n="†" place="bottom">Joh. 16. 2.</note>:</q> Which shews, that they should be such as professedly own'd the true God as the Apostate Christians have all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long pretended to do. So that they must be those Wolves, that the Apostle foretold<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 20. 29.</note> 
                     <q>should arise out of themselves, and worry the Flock of Christ,</q> after the great Falling away should commence, that was foretold by him, and made necessary, in order to the proving of the Faithful, and the Revelation of the great Mystery of Iniquity.</p>
                  <p>I shall conclude this Head with this Assertion, That it is too undeniable a Truth, where the <hi>Clergy</hi> has been most in <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> and has had the greatest influence upon <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> there has been most Confusions, Wrangles, Blood-shed, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questrations, Imprisonments and Exiles: To the justifying of which, I call the Testimony of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of all times. How it is in our Age, I leave to the Experience of the Living: Yet there is one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration that can hardly fail us: The People are
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:006041_0129_0F646F23A86F8C18"/>
not converted but debauched, to a Degree, that time will not allow us an Example. The Worship of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom is visible, ceremonious and gawdy: The <hi>Clergy</hi> ambitious of worldly Preferments, under the pretence of Spiritual Promotions; making the Earthly Revenues of Church-men much the reason of their Function; being almost ever sure to leave the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent smaller Incumbance, to sollicit and obtain Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of larger Title and Income. So that with their Pride and Avarice, which good old <hi>Peter</hi> foresaw would be their Snares, they have drawn after them Ignorance, Misery and Irreligion upon Christendom.</p>
                  <p>§. XVII. The way of Recovery from this mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Defection, is to come to a saving Knowledge of Religion; that is, <hi>an Experience of the Divine Work of God in the Soul:</hi> To obtain which, be diligent to obey the <hi>Grace</hi> that appears in thy own Soul, O man! <hi>that brings Salvation:</hi> It turns thee out of the broad Way into the narrow Way,<note n="†" place="bottom">Tit. 2. 11, 12.</note> from thy Lusts to thy Duty, from sin to holiness, from Satan to God. Thou must see and abhor Self, thou must Watch, and thou must Pray, and thou must Fast: Thou must not look at thy Tempter, but at thy Preserver; avoid ill Company, retire to thy Solitudes, and be a chaste Pilgrim in this evil World: And thus thou wilt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the Knowledge of God and Christ, that brings Eternal Life to the Soul: A well-grounded Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from what a man <hi>feels and knows within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:</hi> Such shall not be moved with evil Tidings.</p>

                  <p>§. 1. BUt let us see the next most common Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and Mischievous Effect of this Evil. Pride does extreamly crave Power, than which, not one thing has proved more Troublesome and Destructive to Mankind. I need not labour my self much in Evidence of this, since most of the Wars of Nations, Depopulation of Kingdoms, Ruin of Cities, with the Slavery and Misery that have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, both our own Experience and unquestionable Histories, acquaint us to have been the Effects of Ambition, which is the Lust of Pride after Power.</p>
                  <p>§. II. How specious soever might be the pretences of <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> against <hi>Moses,</hi> 'twas their Emulation of his mighty Power in the Camp of <hi>Israel,</hi> that put them upon Conspiracies and Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. They long'd for his Authority, and their not having it, was his Crime: For they had a mind to be the Heads and Leaders of the People. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of which was a remarkable Destruction to Themselves, and all their unhappy Accomplices.</p>
                  <p>

§. III. <hi>Absalom</hi> too was for the Peoples Rights,<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Sam. 15.</note> against the Tyranny of his Father and his King; at least, with this pretence, he palliated his Ambition: But his Rebellion shewed he was Impatient for Power, and that he resolved to sacrifice his Duty, as a Son and subject, to the Importunities of his Restless Pride, which brought a Miserable Death to himself, and an Extraordinary slaughter upon his Army.</p>
                  <p>§. IV. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> is a lively instance of the Excessive Lust of Pride for Power. His Successes and Empire were too Heady for him: So much too strong for his Understanding, that he forgot he did not make himself, or that his Power had a Superior. He makes an Image,<note n="*" place="bottom">Dan. 3.</note> and all must Bow to it, or be burnt. And when <hi>Shadrach, Meshach</hi> and <hi>Abed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nego,</hi> refused to comply, <q>Who (says he) is that God that shall deliver you out of my Hands?</q> And notwithstanding the Convictions he had upon him at the Constancy of those Excellent men, and <hi>Daniel's</hi> Interpretation of his Dreams, it was not long before the Pride of his Power had fill'd his Heart, and then his Mouth, with this Haughty Question, <q>Is not this great <hi>Babylon</hi> that I have built for the House of the Kingdom by the might of my <hi>Power,</hi> and for the <hi>Honour</hi> of my Majesty?</q>
                     <note n="‖" place="bottom">Ch. 4. 30.</note> But we are told, that while the Words were in his Mouth, <q>A Voice from Heaven Rebuk'd the <hi>Pride</hi> of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and he was driven from the Society of men, to graze among the Beasts of the Field.</q>

§. V. If we look into the Histories of the World, we shall find many Instances to prove the Mischief of this Lust of Pride. I will mention a few of them for their sakes, who have either not read or consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solon</hi> made <hi>Athens</hi> free by his Excellent Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Laws: But the Ambition of <hi>Pisistratus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the Ruin of it before his Eyes. <hi>Alexander</hi> not contented with his own Kingdom, invades others, and filled with Spoil and Slaughter those Countries he subdued: And it was not ill said of him, who, when <hi>Alexander</hi> accused him of Piracy, told him to his face, <hi>That</hi> Alexander <hi>was the greatest</hi> Pirate <hi>in the World.</hi> It was the same Ambition that made <hi>Coesar</hi> turn Traytor to his Masters, and with their own Army, put into his hand for their Service, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due them to his Yoke, and usurp the Government; which ended in the Expulsion of Freedom and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue together in that Common-wealth. For Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness quickly grew to be Faction in <hi>Rome;</hi> and that Sobriety and Wisdom which ever rendred her Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators Venerable, became dangerous to their Safety: Insomuch that his Successors hardly left one they did not Kill or Banish; unless such as turned to be <hi>Flatterers</hi> of their Unjust Acquisition, and the <hi>Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators</hi> of their Debaucht Manners.</p>
                  <p>§. VI. The <hi>Turks</hi> are a great Proof to the point in hand, who to extend their Dominion, have been the cause of shedding much Blood, and laying many stately Countries Waste. And yet they are to be

out-done by Apostate Christians; whose Practice is therefore more condemnable, because they have been better taught: They have had a Master of another Doctrine and Example. 'Tis true, they call him Lord still, but they let their Ambition Reign: They love Power more than one another; and to get it, Kill one another; tho' charged by him <hi>Not to strive,</hi> but to love and serve one another.<note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 18. v. 1. to 6. Mark 9. 33. to 37.</note> And which adds to the Tragedy, all Natural Affection is sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the Fury of this Lust: And therefore are Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries so often stained with the Murder of Parents, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Uncles, Nephews, Masters, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>§. VII. If we look abroad into remoter parts of the World, we shall rarely hear of Wars, but in Christendom of Peace. A very Trifle is too often made a ground of Quarrel here: Nor can any League be so Sacred or Inviolable, that Arts shall not be used to evade and dissolve it to Increase Dominion. No matter who, nor how many are slain, made Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Orphans, or lose their Estate and Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods; What Countries are ruined, What Towns and Cities Spoil'd; if by all these things the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious can but arrive at their Ends? To go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther back than sixty Years, that little period of time will furnish us with many Wars begun upon ill Grounds, and ended in great Desolation. Nay the last Twelve Years of our time make as pregnant a Demonstration as we can furnish our selves with from the Records of any Age. 'Tis too tedious, nor is it

my business, to be particular: It has been often well observed by others, and is almost known to all, I mean the French, Spanish, German, English and Dutch Wars.</p>
                  <p>§. VIII. But <hi>Ambition</hi> does not only dwell in Courts and Sena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>: It is too natural to every <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Breast</hi> to strain for Power. We daily see how much men labour their utmost Wit and Interest to be Great, to get Higher Places, or greater Titles than they have, that they may look Bigger, and be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; take Place of their former Equals, and so Equal those that were once their Superiors: Compel Friends, and be Revenged on Enemies. This makes Christianity so little lov'd of Worldly Men, Its Kingdom is not of this World: And though they may speak it fair, it is the World they love: That without Uncharitableness we may truly say, People profess Christianity, but they follow the World, they are not for <hi>seeking the Kingdom of Heaven first, and the Righteousness thereof,</hi>

                  <p>§. IX. To conclude this Head; <hi>Great is their Peace, who know a limit to their Ambitious Minds,</hi> that have learnt to be contented with the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Bounds of Providence: That are not careful to be Great, but being great, are Humble and

Mankind; and has been the occasion of great Animosity and Mischief in the World.</p>
                  <p>§ II. We have a pregnant Instance in holy Writ, what Malice and Revenge; the Stomach of Proud Man, is capable of, when not gratified in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. It had almost cost <hi>Mordecai</hi> his Neck, and the whole People of the <hi>Jews</hi> their Lives, because he would not Bow himself to <hi>Haman,</hi> who was a great Favorite to King <hi>Ahasuerus.</hi> And the Practice of the World, even in our own Age, will tell us, That not striking a Flag or Sail; and not Saluting certain Ports or Garisons; yea, less things have given Rise to mighty Wars between States and Kingdoms; to the Expence of much Treasure, but more Blood. The like has followed about the Precedency of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and their Ambassadors. Also the Envy, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and Mischiefs, that have happen'd among pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Persons upon conceit that they have not been Respected to their Degree or Quality among Men, with <hi>Hat, Knee,</hi> or Title: To be sure Duels and Murders not a few.

I will suppose he had kill'd me, for he made several Passes at me, or I in my Defence had kill'd him, when I Disarm'd him, (as

                  <p>§. III. But the truth is, the World, under its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy from God, is as much out of the way, as to <hi>True Honour</hi> and <hi>Respect,</hi> as in other things; for meer Shews (and those vain ones too) are much of the Honour and Respect that are express'd in the World: That a Man may say concerning them, as the Apostle speaks of <hi>Science,</hi> that is, They are Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's and Respects, <hi>falsly so called;</hi> having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Nature of true Honour and Respect in them: But as Degenerate Men, loving to be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, first devised them; so Pride only loves and seeks them, and is Affronted and Angry for want of them. Did Men know a true Christian State, <hi>and the Honour that comes from above,</hi>

                  <p>§. IV. And here give me leave to set down the Reasons more particularly, <hi>why</hi> I, and the People with whom I walk in Religious Society, have declined, as <hi>Vain</hi> and <hi>Foolish,</hi> several Worldly Customs and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions of Respect, much in request at this time a day: And I beseech thee, Reader, to lay aside all Prejudice and Scorn, and with the Meekness and Enquiry of a
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:006041_0139_0F646F2D32AC32D0"/>
Sober and Discreet Mind, read and weigh what may be here alledged in our Defence: And if we are mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, rather Pity and Inform, than Despise and Abuse our Simplicity.</p>
                  <p>§ V. The first and most Pressing Motive upon our Spirits, to decline the Practice of these Present Customs of <hi>Pulling off the Hat, Bowing the Body or Knee,</hi> and giving People <hi>Gawdy Titles, and Epithets</hi> in our Salutations and Addresses, was, <hi>That Savour, Sight and Sense, that God, by his Light and Spirit, has given us of the Christian World's Apostacy from God, and the Cause and Effects of that Great and lamentable Defection.</hi> In the Discovery of which, the Sense of our State came first before us, and we were made to <hi>see him whom we had pierced, and to mourn for it.</hi> A Day of Humiliation overtook us, and we fainted to that Pleasure and Delight we once loved. Now our Works went before hand to Judgment, and a Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-Search was made, and the words of the Prophet became well understood by us; <q>Who shall abide the Day of his Coming? And <hi>who</hi> shall stand when he appears; He will sit as a Refiners Fire; and as Fullers Sope<note n="†" place="bottom">Mal. 3. 2.</note>:</q> And as the Apostle said,<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. 4. 18.</note> 
                     <q>If the Righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and the Sinner appear? Wherefore, says the Apostle<note n="‖" place="bottom">2 Cor. 5. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Paul,</hi> knowing the Terrors of the Lord, we perswade men.</q> What to do? To come out of the Nature, Spirit, Lusts and Customs of this Wicked World: Remembring that, as Jesus has said, <q>for
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:006041_0140_0F646F2DED7FA4E0"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>This concern of Mind and Dejection of Spirit, was visible to our Neighbours; and we are not ashamed to own that the Terrors of the Lord took such hold upon us, because we had long under a Profession of Religion, grieved God's Holy Spirit, that reproved us in secret for our Disobedience; that as we abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to think of continuing in our old Sins, so we feared to use Lawful things, left we should use them unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. The words of the Prophet were fulfilled on us<note n="*" place="bottom">Jer. 30. 6.</note>: <q>Wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his Loyns as a Woman in Travail?</q> Many a Pang and Throw have we had; Our Heaven seemed to melt away, and our Earth to be removed out of its place; and were like men, as the Apostle said, <hi>Upon whom the ends of the World were come.</hi> God, he knows it was so in this day, the Brightness of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Souls discovered, and the Breath of his Mouth destroyed every Plant he had not Planted in us. He was a swift Witness against every evil Tho't, and every unfruitful Work; and blessed be his Name we were not offended in him, or at his Righteous Judgments. Now it was, that Grand Inquest came upon our whole Life: Every Word, Thought and Deed was brought to Judgment, the Root examin'd, and its Tendency considered<note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Joh. 2.</note>. <q>The Lust of the Eye, the Lust of the Flesh, and the Pride of Life</q> were opened to our view; the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> in
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:006041_0141_0F646F2E726A72C8"/>
us: And by the knowing the Evil Leaven, and its divers Evil Effects in our selves; how it had wrought, and what it had done; we came to have a sense and knowledge of the States of others: And what we could not, nay, we dare not let live and continue in our selves (as being manifested to us to proceed from an Evil Principle in the time of Man's Degeneracy) we could not comply with in others. Now this I say, and that in the Fear and presence of the All-see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Just God, the present Honours and Respect of the World, among other things became Burdensome to us: We saw they had no being in Paradise, that they grew in the Night time, and came from an ill Root; and that they only delighted a Vain and Ill Mind, and that much Pride and Folly were in them.</p>
                  <p>§. VI. And though we easily foresaw the <hi>Storms</hi> of <hi>Reproach</hi> that would fall upon us, for our refusing to practice them; yet we were so far from being sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in our Judgment, that it abundantly confirmed our sense of them. For so exalted a thing is Man, and so loving of Honour and Respect even from his Fellow Creatures, that so soon as in <hi>Tenderness</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> towards God, we could not perform them, as formerly, he became more concern'd than for all the rest of our Differences, however Material to Salvation. So that let the Honour of God, and our own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do as it will, it was greater Heresie and Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to refuse him the <hi>Homage</hi> of the <hi>Hat,</hi> and his usual Titles of Honour; to <hi>deny to pledge his Healths, or play with him at Cards and Dice,</hi> than any
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:006041_0142_0F646F2F078556B8"/>
other Principle we maintained for being less in his view, it seemed not so much in his way.</p>
                  <p>§. VII. And though it be frequently objected, <hi>That we seek to set up outward Forms of Preciseness;</hi> and that it is but as a <hi>green Ribbon, the Badge of the Party, the better to be known.</hi> I do declare in the Fear of Almighty God, that these are but the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations and vain Constructions of Unsensible Men, that have not had that sense, which the Lord hath giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us, of what arises from the Right and the Wrong Root in Man: And when such Censures of our Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity shall be inwardly touched and awakened, by the mighty Power of God, and see things as they are in their proper Natures and Seeds, they will then know their own Burden, and easily acquit us without the Imputation of Folly or Hypocrisie herein.</p>
                  <p>§. VIII. To say, <hi>That we strain at small things, which becomes not People of so fair pretensions to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Freedom of Spirit.</hi> I answer with Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Truth and Sobriety; <hi>First,</hi> nothing is small, that God makes matter of Conscience to do or leave undone. <hi>Next,</hi> As inconsiderable as they are made by those that object upon us, they are much set by; so greatly as for our not given them, to be Beaten, Imprisoned, refused Justice upon Application to Courts of Justice, &amp;c. To say nothing of the Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Reproach that hath been frequently flung at us on this Account. So that if we had wanted a Proof of the Truth of our Inward Belief and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the very Practice of them that opposed it,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:006041_0143_0F646F2FAE9896C0"/>
would have abundantly confirmed us. But let it suffice to us, That <hi>Wisdom is justified of her Children:</hi> We only passively let fall the Practice of what we are taught to believe is Vain and Unchristian: In which we are Negative to Forms: For we leave off, we don't set up Forms.</p>
                  <p>§. IX. The World is so set upon the Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part and Outside of things, that it has well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemed the Wisdom of God in all Ages, to bring forth his Dispensations with very different Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances to their settled Customs; thereby contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humane Inventions, and proving the Integrity of his Confessors. Nay, it is a Test upon the World: It tries what Patience, Kindness, Sobriety and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration they have: If the rough and homely Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of Truth stumble not their Minds from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of it (whose Beauty is within) it makes a great Discovery upon them. For he which refuses a <hi>Precious Jewel,</hi> because it is presented in a <hi>plain Box,</hi> will never Esteem it to its value, nor set his Heart upon keeping it: Therefore I call it a Test, because it shews where the Hearts and Affections of People slick, after all their great Pretences to more Excellent Things.</p>
                  <p>§. X. It is also a mighty Tryal upon God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in that they are put upon the Discovery of their Contradiction to the Customs generally receiv'd and esteem'd in the World; which exposes them to the Wonder, Scorn, and Abuse of the Multitude. But there is an hidden Treasure in it: It inures us to
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:006041_0144_0F646F30714265B8"/>
Reproach, it learns us to despise the false Reputation of the World, and silently to undergo the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and Scorn of its Votaries; and finally with a Christian Meeekness and Patience, to overcome their Injuries and Reproaches. Add to this; It weans thee off thy Familiars; for by being slighted of them as a Ninne, a Fool, a Frantick, &amp;c. Thou art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from a greater Temptation, and that is, <hi>The Power and Influence of their vain Conversation.</hi> And last of all, it lists thee of the Company of the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, Mocked, Persecuted Jesus: To fight under his Banner, against the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil:</hi> That after having faithfully Suffered with him in a State of Humiliation, thou may'st Reign with him in a State of Glorification: Who Glorifies his Poor, Despised, Constant Followers, <hi>with the Glory he had with his Father before the World began.</hi> This was the <hi>First</hi> Reason of our declining to practice the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned <hi>Honours, Respects,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>§. XI. The Second Reason, why we decline and refuse the present use of these Customs in our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses and Salutations, is from the consideration of their very Emptiness and Vanity: That there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>true Honour</hi> and <hi>Respect</hi> in them, supposing them not to be Evil. And as Religion and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship are degenerated into Form and Ceremony (and they not according to Primitive Practice neither) so is Honour and Respect too; there being little of that in the World, as well as of the other; and to be sure, in these Customs, none that is Justifiable by Scripture or Reason.</p>

§. XII. In Scripture, we find the word <hi>Honour</hi> often and diversly used. First, For Obedience: As when God faith,<note n="†" place="bottom">I Sam. 2. 30.</note> 'They that Honour me; that is, that keep my Commandments. Honour the King; that is, Obey the King<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod 20. 12.</note> Honour thy Father and thy Mother; that is, (saith the Apostle to the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ephes. 6. I, 2.</note>. Obey thy Father and thy Mother in the Lord, for that is right;' Take heed to their Precepts and Advice; pre-supposing always, that Rulers and Parents command Lawful Things, else they Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour themselves to injoyn Unlawful Things; and Subjects and Children dishonour their Superiors and Parents, in complying with their Unrighteous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Also, Christ uses this word so, when he says, <hi>I have not a</hi> Devil, <hi>but I</hi> Honour <hi>my Father, and ye</hi> Dishonour <hi>me</hi>
                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">John 8. 49.</note>: That is, I do my Father's Will, in what I do; but you will not hear me; you reject my Counsel, and will not <hi>Obey my Voice.</hi> 'Twas not refusing <hi>Hat</hi> and <hi>Knee,</hi> nor <hi>empty Titles:</hi> No, 'twas Disobedience; Resisting Him that God had sent, and not Believing in him. This was the Dishonour he taxed them with; using him as an Impostor, that God had ordained for the Salvation of the World. And of these Dishonourers, there are but too many at this day. Christ has a Saying to the same effect; <hi>That all Men should</hi> Honour <hi>the son, even as they</hi> Honour <hi>the Father; and he that</hi> Honoureth <hi>not the Son,</hi> Honoureth <hi>not the Father,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:006041_0146_0F646F32A92C11D0"/>
which hath sent him:</hi> That is, they that hearken not to Christ, and do not Worship and Obey him, they do not Hear, Worship, nor Obey God. As they pretended to believe in God, so they were to have believed in him; he told them so. This is preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly manifested in the case of the Centurion, whose Faith was so much commended by Christ, where, giving Jesus an account of his Honourable Station, he tells him, <hi>He had Soldiers under his Authority, and when he said to one,</hi> Go, <hi>he went; to another,</hi> Come, <hi>he came; and to a third,</hi> Do this, <hi>he did it.</hi> In This it was he placed the Honour of his Capacity, and the Respect of his Soldiers, and not in Hats <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Legs: Nor are such Customs yet in use amongst Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, being Effeminate, and unworthy of Masculine Gravity.</p>
                  <p>§. XIII. In the next place, Honour is used for <hi>Preferment to Trust and Eminent Employments.</hi> So the Psalmist speaking to God;<note n="†" place="bottom">Psal. 8. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>For thou hast Crown'd him with Glory and</hi> Honour: Again;<note n="*" place="bottom">and 21. 5.</note> Honour <hi>and</hi> Majesty <hi>hast thou laid on him:</hi> That is, God had given Christ Power over all his Enemies, and exalted him to great Dominion. Thus the Wise Man Intimates, when he says,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Prov. 1. 23.</note> 'The fear of the Lord is the Instruction of Wisdom, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Honour is Humility:' That is, before Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Preferment, is Humility. Further, he has this Saying;<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ch. 26. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>As Snow in Summer, and as Rain in Harvest, so</hi> Honour <hi>is not seemly for a Fool:</hi> That is,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:006041_0147_0F646F34901251A0"/>
A Fool is not capable of the Dignity of Trust, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, or Preferment; they require Virtue, Wisdom, Integrity, Diligence, of which Fools are unfurnish'd. And yet if the Respects and Titles, in Use amongst us are to go for Marks of Honour, <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Proverb will take place, and doubtless doth, upon the Practice of this Age, that yields so much of that Honour to a great many of <hi>Solomon's Fools;</hi> who are not only silly Men, but Wicked too; such as refuse Instruction, and hate the Fear of the Lord; which only maketh one of his Wise Men.</p>
                  <p>§. XIV. And as Vertue and Wisdom are the same, so Folly and Wickedness. Thus <hi>Shechem</hi>'s Ravishment of <hi>Dinah, Jacob</hi>'s Daughter,<note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. 34. 7.</note> is called: So is the Rebellion and Wickedness of the <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Joshua</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Josh. 7. 14, 15.</note> The <hi>Psalmist</hi> expresses it thus;<note n="‖" place="bottom">Pl. 85. 8.</note> 
                     <q>My Wounds stink because of my <hi>Foolishness;</hi>
                     </q> that is, his Sin. And, <q>The Lord will speak Peace to his Saints, that they turn not again to <hi>Folly;</hi>
                     </q> that is to Evil. <q>His own Iniquities (says Solomon<note n="‡" place="bottom">Prov. 5. 22, 23.</note>) shall take the Wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the Cords of his Sins: He shall dye without Instruction, and in the greatness of his Folly he shall go astray.</q> Christ puts Foolishness with Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Pride, Thefts, Murders, Adulteries, Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,<note n="**" place="bottom">Mark 7. 21, 22.</note> &amp;c. I was the more willing to add these Passages, to shew the Difference that there is between the Mind of the Holy Ghost, and the Notion that
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:006041_0148_0F646F3550092210"/>
those Ages had of Fools, that deserve not Honour, and that which is generally meant by Fools and Folly in our own Time; that we may the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Disproportion there is between Honour, as then understood by the Holy Ghost, and those that were led thereby, and the Apprehension of it, and Practice of these latter Ages of Professed Christians.</p>
                  <p>§. XV. But <hi>Honour</hi> is also taken for <hi>Reputation,</hi> and it is so understood with us. <hi>A Gracious Woman</hi> (says <hi>Solomon</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. 1. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>retaineth Honour:</hi> That is, she keeps her Credit; and by her Vertue, maintains her Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Sobriety and Chastity. In another place; <hi>It is an</hi> Honour <hi>for a man to cease from Strife:</hi> That is, it makes for his Reputatoin, as a wife and good Man. Christ uses the word thus, where he says,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 13. 59.</note> 
                     <q>A Prophet is not without <hi>Honour,</hi> save in his own Country:</q> That is, he has Credit, and is Valued, save at Home. The Apostle to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> has a Saying to that effect: <q>That every one of you should know how to possess his Vessel in Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and <hi>Honour;</hi>
                     </q> that is, in Chastity and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety<note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Thes.4 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>Tim.5. 17.</note> In all which, nothing of the Fashions, by us declined, is otherwise concerned, than to be totally Excluded.</p>
                  <p>§. XVI. There is yet another use of the word [<hi>Honour</hi>] in Scripture, and that is to Functions and Capacities: As, <hi>An Elder is worthy of double</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: That is, he deserves double Esteem, Love, and Respect; being Holy, Merciful, Temperate,
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:006041_0149_0F646F35ABB5B280"/>
Peaceable, Humble, &amp;c. Especially one that labours in Word and Doctrine. So <hi>Paul</hi> recommends <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> to the <hi>Philippians;</hi> 
                     <q>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all Gladness, and hold such in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation:</hi>
                     </q> As if he had said, Let them be Valued and Regarded by you in what they say and teach. Which is the truest, and most natural and convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way of testifying Respect to a Man of God; as Christ said to his Disciples, <q>If you love me, ye will keep my <hi>Sayings.</hi>
                     </q> Further, the Apostle bids us, <hi>To</hi> Honour <hi>Widows indeed;</hi> that is, such Women as are of Chaste Lives, and Exemplary Vertue, are Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable. Marriage is Honourable too, with this Proviso,<note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. 13. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>That the bed be undefiled:</hi> So that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Marriage, is the Chastity of the Married.</p>
                  <p>§. XVII. The word <hi>Honour</hi> in the Scripture is also used of Superiors to Inferiors. Which is plain in that of <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> to <hi>Haman;</hi> 
                     <q>What shall be done to the Man, whom the King delighteth to <hi>Honour</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Esth. 3. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. chap.</note>?</q> Why, he mightily Advanced him, as <hi>Mordecai</hi> afterwards. And more particularly it is said, <q>That the Jews had light, and Gladness, and Joy, and <hi>Honour:</hi>
                     </q> That is, they escaped the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution that was like to fall upon them, and by the means of <hi>Esther</hi> and <hi>Mordecai,</hi> they enjoyed, not only Peace, but Favour and Countenance too. In this sense the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> advised Christian Men,<note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Pet. 3.</note> To <hi>Honour</hi> their Wives; that is, to Love, Value, Cherish, Countenance and Esteem them, for their
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:006041_0150_0F646F367234C0B0"/>
Fidelity and Affection to their Husbands, for their Tenderness and Care over their Children, and for their Diligence and Circumspection in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: There's no <hi>Ceremonious Behaviour,</hi> or <hi>Gawdy Titles,</hi> requisite to express this <hi>Honour.</hi> Thus God <hi>Honours</hi> holy Men: <q>They (says the Lord) that Honour me, I will Honour; and they that despise me, shall be lightly esteemed:</q>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam. 2. 20.</note> That is, I will do Good to them, I will Love, Bless, Countenance, and Prosper them that Honour me, that Obey me: But they that Despise me, that Resist my Spirit, and Break my Law, they shall be lightly esteemed, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle set by, or accounted of; they shall not find Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God, nor Righteous Men. And so we see it daily among Men: If the Great visit, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themselves to aid the Poor, we say, that such a Great Man did me the Honour to come and see or help me in my Need.</p>
                  <p>§. XVIII. I shall conclude this with one Passage more, and that is a very large, plain and pertinent one: <hi>Honour all Men, and Love the Brotherhood:</hi> That is, Love is above Honour, and that is reserved for the Brotherhood. But Honour, which is Esteem and Regard, that thou owest to all Men; and if all, then thy Inferiors. But why for <hi>all Men?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are the Creation of God, and the Noblest Part of his Creation too; they are also thy own Kind: Be Natural, have Bowels, and assist them with what thou canst; be ready to perform any Real Respect,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:006041_0151_0F646F3737B8F808"/>
and yield them any Good or Countenance thou canst.</p>
                  <p>§. XIX. And yet there seems a Limitation to this Command, <hi>Honour all Men,</hi> in that Passage of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Ps. 15. 4.</note> 
                     <q>Who shall abide in thy Tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy Hill? He in whose Eyes a vile Person is contemned; but he Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them that Fear the Lord.</q> Here Honour is confined and affixed to Godly Persons, and Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour made the Duty of the Righteous to the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a mark of their being Righteous, that they Dishonour; that is, slight or disregard them. To conclude this Scripture-Inquiry after Honour, I shall contract the Subject of it under three Capacities, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, Equals, and Inferiors: Honour to Superiors, is Obedience; to Equals, Love; to Inferiors, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and Help; That is Honour after God's Mind, and the holy People's Fashion of Old.</p>
                  <p>§. XX. But how little of all this is to be seen or had in a poor Empty <hi>Hat, Bow, Cringe,</hi> or <hi>Gawdy, Flattering Title?</hi> Let the Truth speaking Witness of God in all Mankind judge. For I must not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Corrupt, Proud, and Self-seeking Man, of the Good or Evil of these Customs; that as little as he would render them, are loved and sought by him, and he is out of Humour and Angry if he has them not.</p>
                  <p>This is our <hi>Second Reason,</hi> why we refuse to Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise the accustomed Ceremonies of <hi>Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,</hi> because we find no such Notion or Expression
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:006041_0152_0F646F386966F020"/>
of Honour and Respect, recommended to us by the Holy Ghost in the Scriptures of Truth.</p>
                  <p>§. XXI. Our <hi>Third Reason</hi> for not using them as Testimonies of Honour and Respect, is, <hi>Because there is no discovery of</hi> Honour <hi>or Respect to be made by them:</hi> 'Tis rather Eluding and Equivocating it; cheating People of the Honour or Respect that is due to them; giving them Nothing in the shew of Something. There is in them no Obedience to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, no Love to Equals, no Help or Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to Inferiors.</p>
                  <p>§. XXII. We are, we declare to the whole World, for <hi>True Honour and Respect:</hi> We Honour the King, our Parents, our Masters, our Magistrates, our Landlords, one another, yea all Men, after God's Way, used by holy Men and Women of old time: But we refuse these Customs, as vain and deceitful; not answering the End they are used for.</p>
                  <p>§. XXIII. But <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There is yet more to be said: We find that Vain, Loose, and Worldly Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are the <hi>great Lovers</hi> and <hi>Practisers</hi> of them, and most deride our Simplicity of Behaviour. Now we assuredly know, from the sacred Testimonies, <hi>that those People cannot give</hi> true Honour <hi>that live in a</hi> dishonourable <hi>Spirit;</hi> they understand it not: But they can give the <hi>Hat</hi> and <hi>Knee;</hi> and that they are very liberal of; nor are any more expert at it. This is, to us, a proof, that No true Honour can be testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by those Customs, which Vanity and Looseness love and use.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="unknown:006041_0153_0F646F39700215B8"/>
§. XXIV. Next to them, I will add <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> and <hi>Revenge</hi> too. For how little do many care for each other? Nay, what Spight, Envy, Animosity, secret Back-biring, and Plotting one against another, under the use of these Idle Respects; till Passion, too strong for Cunning, break through Hypocrisie into open Affront and Revenge too. It cannot be so with the Scripture-Honour: To Obey, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a Man, out of Spight, is not usually done; and to Love, Help, Serve, and Countenance a Person, in order to Deceive and be Revenged of him, is a thing never heard of: These admit of no Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, nor Revenge. Men do not these things to palliate Ill will, which are the Testimonies of quite the contrary. 'Tis absurd to Imagine it, because impossible to be done.</p>
                  <p>§. XXV. Our <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                           <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> is, That <hi>Honour was from the beginning,</hi> but <hi>Hat Respects, and most Titles, are of late:</hi> Therefore there was true Honour before Hats or Titles; and consequently true Honour stands not in them. And that which ever was the way to express true Honour, is the best way still; and this the Scripture teaches better than Dancing-Masters can do.</p>
                  <p>§. XXVI. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> If <hi>Honour consist, in such like Ceremonies, then will it follow, that they are most ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of shewing Honour, who perform it most exactly according to the Mode or Fashion of the Times;</hi> conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that Man hath not the Measure of true Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, from a Just and Reasonable Principle in himself,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:006041_0154_0F646F3A26F95F08"/>
but by the Means and Skill of the Fantastick Danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Masters of the Times: And for this cause it is, we see, that many give much Money to have their Children learn their Honours, falsly so called. And what doth this but totally exclude the poor <hi>Country People:</hi> who, though they Plow, Till, Sow, Reap, go to Market; and in all things Obey their Justices, Landlords, Fathers, and Masters, with Sincerity and Sobriety, rarely use those Ceremonies; but if they do, it is so Awkwardly and Meanly, that they are esteemed by a Court Critick so Ill favour'd, as only fit to make a Jest of, and be laugh'd at: But what sober Man will not deem their Obedience beyond the others Vanity and Hypocrisie? This Base Notion of Honour turns out of Doors the True, and sets the False in its place. Let it be further considered, that the Way or Fashion of doing it, is much more in the Design of its Performers, as well as View of its Spectators, than the Respect it self. Whence it's commonly said, <hi>He is a Man of good Mein;</hi> or, <hi>She is a Woman of exact Behaviour.</hi> And what is this <hi>Behaviour,</hi> but <hi>Fantastick, Crampt Postures,</hi> and <hi>Crin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, Unnatural</hi> to their Shape; and, if it were not Fashionable, <hi>Ridiculous</hi> to the view of all People; and is therefore to the <hi>Eastern Countries a Proverb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. XXVII. But yet <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Real Honour <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists not in a Hat, Bow, or Title, because all these things may be had for Money.</hi> For which Reason, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Dancing-Schools, Plays,</hi> &amp;c. are there in the Land, to whom Youth is generally sent to be Educated in
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:006041_0155_0F646F3C32057F08"/>
these Vain Fashions? Whilst they are ignorant of the <hi>Honour that is of God,</hi> and their Minds are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured to Visible Things that Perish; and instead of remembring their Creator, are taken up with <hi>Toys</hi> and <hi>Fopperies;</hi> and sometimes so much worse, as to cost themselves a Disinheriting, and their Indiscreet Parents Grief and Misery all their Days. If Parents would Honour God in the help of his Poor, with the Substance they bestow on such an Education they would find a far better Account in the End.<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. 3. 9.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. XXVIII. But <hi>Lastly, We cannot esteem Bows, Titles,</hi> and <hi>Pulling off of Hats,</hi> to be real <hi>Honour,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such like <hi>Customs have been prohibited by God, his Son and Servants, in days past.</hi> This I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to shew by Three or Four Express Authorities.</p>
                  <p>§. XXIX. My First Example and Authority, is taken from the Story of <hi>Mordecai</hi> and <hi>Haman:</hi> so close to this point, that methinks it should at least command Silence to the Objections frequently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced against us. <hi>Haman</hi> was first Minister of State and Favorite to King <hi>Ahasuerus.</hi> The Text says,<note n="†" place="bottom">Esth. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> That <q>the King set his Seat above all the Princes that were with him; and all the King's Servants Bowed and Reverenced <hi>Haman;</hi> for the King had so commanded concerning him: But <hi>Mordecai</hi> (it seems) Bowed not, nor did him Reverence.</q> This, at first, made ill for <hi>Mordecai:</hi> A Gallows was prepared for him at <hi>Haman's</hi> Command. But the sequel of the Story shows, that <hi>Haman</hi> Proved his own Invention,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:006041_0156_0F646F3CF2783638"/>
and Ended his Pride with his Life upon it. Well now, speaking as the World speaks, and looking upon <hi>Mordecai</hi> without the Knowledge of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess; Was not <hi>Mordecai</hi> a very <hi>Clown,</hi> at least a <hi>Silly, Morose,</hi> and <hi>Humorous</hi> Man, to run such a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard for a Trifle? What hurt had it done him to have Bowed to, and Honoured one the King Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured? Did he not despise the King in disregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Haman?</hi> Nay, had not the King commanded that Respect? And are not we to Honour and Obey the King? One would have thought, he might have <hi>Bowed</hi> for the King's sake, whatever he had in his Heart, and yet have come off well enough; for that he <hi>Bowed</hi> not meerly to <hi>Haman,</hi> but to the King's Authority; besides, it was but an Innocent Ceremony. But it seems, <hi>Mordecai</hi> was too <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>stout,</hi> and not Fine and Subtile enough to avoid the Displeasure of <hi>Haman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Howbeit, he was an excellent Man: <hi>He feared God, and wrought Righteousness.</hi> And in this very thing also, he pleased God, and even the King too, at last, that had most cause to be Angry with him: For he advanced him to <hi>Haman</hi>'s Dignity; and, if it could be, to greater Honour. 'Tis true, sad News first came; no less than Destruction to <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai,</hi> and the whole People of the <hi>Jews</hi> besides, for his sake: But <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s Integrity and Humiliation, his Fasting and strong Cries to God, prevailed, and the People were saved, and poor condemned <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi> comes, after all, to be exalted above the Princes.

                  <p>§. XXX. But before I leave this Section, 'tis fit I add, That in Conference with a late <hi>Bishop</hi> (and none of the least Eminent) upon this Subject and Instance, I remember he sought to evade it thus: <q>
                        <hi>Mordecai</hi> (says he) did not refuse to Bow, as it was a Testimony of Respect to the King's Favourite; but he being a Figure and Type of Christ, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused it, because <hi>Haman</hi> was of the Uncircumcision, and ought to Bow to him rather.</q> To which I Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; That allowing <hi>Mordecai</hi> to be a Figure of Christ, and the <hi>Jews</hi> of God's People or Church; and that as the <hi>Jews</hi> were saved by <hi>Mordecai,</hi> so the <hi>Church</hi> is saved by <hi>Christ;</hi> this makes for me: For then, by that Reason, the Spiritual Circumcision, or People of Christ, are not to Receive and Bow to the Fashions and Customs of the Spiritual Uncircumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who are the Children of the World; of which,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:006041_0158_0F646F3DF2BFF568"/>
such as were condemnable so long ago, in the time of the Type and Figure, can by no means be justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably Received or Practised in the time of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type or Substance it self. On the contrary, this shews expresly, we are faithfully to decline such Worldly Customs, and not to fashion our selves according to the Conversation of Earthly-minded People; but be renewed and changed in our Ways; and keep close to our <hi>Mordecai;</hi> who having not Bowed, we must not Bow, that are his People and Followers. And whatever be our Sufferings or Reproaches, they will have an end: <hi>Mordecai</hi> our <hi>Captain,</hi> that appears for his People throughout all the Provinces, in the King's Gate, will deliver us at last; and, for his sake, we shall be favoured and loved of the King himself too. So Powerful is faithful <hi>Mordecai</hi> at last. Therefore let us all look to <hi>Jesus,</hi> our <hi>Mordecai</hi> the <hi>Israel</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; he that has Power with God, and would not Bow in the Hour of Temptation, but has mightily Prevailed; and therefore is a <hi>Prince for ever, and of his Government there shall never be End</hi>

                  <p>§. XXXI. The next Scripture Instance I urge against these Customs, is a Passage in <hi>Job,</hi> thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest;<note n="*" place="bottom">Job. 32. 21, 22.</note> 
                     <q>Let me not, I pray you, accept any Man's Person; neither let me give <hi>Flattering Titles</hi> unto Man, for I know not to give <hi>Flattering Titles;</hi> in so doing my Maker would soon take me away.</q> The Question that will arise upon the Allegation of this Scripture, is this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                     <hi>What Titles are Flattering?</hi>
                     <pb n="135" facs="unknown:006041_0159_0F646F3EB1A4FFE8"/>
The Answer is obvious, namely, Such as are empty and Fictitious, and make him more than he is. As to call a Man what he is not, to please him; or to Exalt him beyond his true Name, Office or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, to gain upon his Affection; who it may be, lusteth to honour and respect: Such as these, <hi>Most Excellent, Most Sacred, Your Grace, Your Lordship, Most Dread Majesty, Right Honourable, Right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipful, May it please Your Majesty, Your Grace, Your Lordship, Your Honour, Your Worship,</hi> and the like unnecessary Titles; and Attributes, calculated only to please and tickle Poor, Proud, Vain yet Mortal Man. Likewise to call Man what he is not, as <hi>My Lord, My Master,</hi> &amp;<hi>c.</hi> And <hi>Wise, Just,</hi> or <hi>Good,</hi> (when he is neither) only to please him, or shew him Respect.</p>
                  <p>It was familiar thus to do among the <hi>Jews,</hi> under their Degeneracy; wherefore one came to Christ and said,<note n="†" place="bottom">Luke 18. 18, 19.</note> 'Good Master, What shall I do to have Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life?' It was a Salutation or Address of Respect in those times. 'Tis familiar now: <hi>Good my Lord, Good Sir, Good Master,</hi> do this, or do that. But what was Christ's Answer? How did he take it? <hi>Why callest thou me</hi> Good? says Christ, <hi>There is none</hi> Good <hi>save one, that is</hi> God. He rejected it, that had more Right to keep it than all Mankind: And why? Because there was one <hi>Greater</hi> than he; and that he saw the Man addrest it to his <hi>Manhood,</hi> after the way of the Times, and not his <hi>Divinity</hi> which dwelt within it; therefore Christ refuses it, shewing
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:006041_0160_0F646F3F6992F1C0"/>
and instructing us that we should not give such <hi>Epithets</hi> and <hi>Titles</hi> commonly to Men: For good being due alone to God and Godliness, it can only be said in <hi>Flattery</hi> to <hi>fallen</hi> Man, and therefore Sinful to be so said.</p>
                  <p>This Plain and Exact Life well became him that was on purpose manifested to Return and Restore Man from his Lamentable Degeneracy, to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and Purity of his first Creation; who has taught us to be careful, how we use and give Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes unto Man, by that most severe saying,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 12. 36.</note> 
                     <q>That every idle word that man shall speak, he shall give an Account thereof in the day of Judgment.</q> And that which should warn all men of the Latitude they take herein, and sufficiently justifie our Tenderness, is this, <hi>That man can scarcely commit greater Injury and Offence against Almighty God, than to ascribe any of his Attributes unto Man, the Creature of his Word, and the Work of his Hands.</hi> He is a Jealous God of his <hi>Honour,</hi> and will not give his Glory unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Besides, it is so near the Sin of the <hi>Aspiring, fallen Angels,</hi> that affected to be greater and better than they were made and stated by the great Lord of all, and looks so like Idolatry to entitle man to a Station above his Make and Orb (the unpardonable Sin under the Law) that it is hard to think, how men and women professing Christianity, and seriously reflecting upon their Vanity and Evil in these things, can continue in them, much less Plead for them, and least of all Reproach and Deride those that through
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:006041_0161_0F646F4127EB0268"/>
Tenderness of Conscience cannot use and give them. It seems that <hi>Elibu</hi> did not dare to do it; but put such Weight upon the matter, as to give this for one Reason of his forbearance, to wit <hi>Lest my Maker should soon take me away:</hi> That is <q>For Fear God should strike me dead, I dare not give man Titles, that are above him, or Titles meerly to please him. I may not, by any means, gratifie that Spirit which lusteth after such things. <hi>God is to be exalted, and Man abased.</hi> God is jealous of Man's being set higher than his Station: He will have him keep his Place, know his Original, and remember the Rock from whence he came: That what he has is borrowed, not his own, but his Maker's, who bro't him forth, and sustained him; which Man is very apt to forget. And lest I should be accessary to it by <hi>Flattering Titles,</hi> instead of telling him truly and plainly what he is, and using him as he ought to be treated, and thereby provoke my Maker to Displeasure, and he, in his Anger and Jealousie, should <hi>take me soon away,</hi> or bring sudden Death, and an untimely End upon me, I dare not use, I dare not give such Titles unto Men.</q>

                  <p>§. XXXII. But if we had not this to alledge from the Old Testament Writings, it should and ought to suffice with Christians, that these Customs are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="138" facs="unknown:006041_0162_0F646F41AB476438"/>
the Country they live in: For he charges it upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> as a Mark of their Apostacy: <q>How can ye believe, which receive Honour one of another, and seek not the Honour that cometh from God only?</q> Where their Infidelity concerning Christ is made the Effect of seeking Worldly, and not Heavenly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour only. And the thing is not hard to apprehend, if we consider that Self Love, and Desire of Honour from Men is inconsistent with the Love and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Christ. They sought the good Opinion and Respect of the World, how then was it possible, they should <hi>leave all and follow him, whose Kingdom is not of this World;</hi> and that came in a way so cross to the Mind and Humour of it? And that this was the meaning of our Lord Jesus, is plain: For he tells us, what that <hi>Honour</hi> was, they gave and received, which he condemned them for, and of which he bid the Disciples of his Humility and Cross beware. His Words are these (and he speaks them not of the <hi>Rabble,</hi> but of the <hi>Doctors,</hi> the great Men, the <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> among the <hi>Jews) They Love</hi> (says he<note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 23. 6, 10, 11.

It is upon these Men of Breeding and Quality, that he pronounces his Woes, making these Practices some of the <hi>Evil Marks,</hi> by which to know them, as well as some of the Motives of his Threatnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. But he leaves it not here: He pursues this very point of <hi>Honour,</hi> above all the rest, in his Caution to his Disciples; to whom he gave in Charge thus: <q>But be not ye called <hi>Rabbi;</hi> for one is your Master, even Christ, and all ye are Brethren. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ye called Masters; but he that is greatest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, shall be your Servant: And whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shall exalt himself, shall be abased.</q> Plain it is, that these Passages carry a severe Rebuke, both to Woldly Honour in General, and to those Members and Expressions of it in Particular, which, as near as the Language of Scripture and Customs of that Age will permit, do distinctly reach and allude to those of our own time; for the declining of which we have suffered so much Scorn and Abuse, both in our Persons and Estates: God forgive the unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Authors of it!</p>
                  <p>§. XXXIII. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> has a Saying of great Weight and Fervency, in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> very agreeable to this Doctrine of Christ; 'tis this: <q>I beseech you therefore, Brethren by the Mercies of God, that ye present your Bodies a Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:006041_0164_0F646F43F13A8A00"/>
your reasonable Service: <hi>And be not Conformed to this World,</hi> but be ye Transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that Good, and Acceptable, and Perfect Will of God.</q> He writ to a People in the midst of the Ensnaring Pomp and Glory of the World: <hi>Rome</hi> was the Seat of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and the Empire: The Mistress of Invention. Her Fashions, as those of <hi>France</hi> now, were as Laws to the World, at least at <hi>Rome:</hi> Whence it is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial;
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Cum fueris Romoe, Romano vivito more.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But the Apostle is of another Mind: He warns the Christians of that City, <hi>That they be not conformed;</hi> that is, that they do not follow the <hi>vain Fashions</hi> and Customs of this World, but leave them: The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phasis lies upon <hi>This,</hi> as well as upon <hi>Conformed:</hi> And it imports, that <hi>This World,</hi> which they were not to Conform to, was the Corrupt and Degenerate Condition of Mankind in that Age. Wherefore the Apostle proceeds to exhort those Believers, and that by the <hi>Mercies</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> (the most powerful and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all Arguments) <hi>That they would be Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;</hi> that is, Changed from the way of Life, custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary among the <hi>Romans; and prove what is that acceptable Will of God.</hi> As if he had said, <q>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what you do and practise; see if it be right, and that it please God: Call every Thought, Word, and Action to Judgment; try whether they are wrought in God or not; that so you may prove or

                  <p>§. XXXIV. The next Scripture-Authority we appeal to, in our Vindication, is a Passage of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Peter,</hi> in his first Epistle, writ to the Believing Strangers throughout the Countries of <hi>Pontus, Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, Capadocia, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Bithynia;</hi> which were the Churches of Christ Jesus in those parts of the World, gathered by his Power and Spirit: 'Tis this; <q>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. 1. 13, 14.</note> Gird up the Loyns of your minds; be sober, and hope to the end, for the Grace that is to be brought unto you at the Revelation of Jesus Christ; as O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient Children, not <hi>Fashioning</hi> your selves accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the former Lusts of your Ignorance.</q> That is, <q>Be not found in the vain Fashions and Customs of the World, unto which you Conformed in your former Ignorance: But as you have Believed in a more plain and excellent Way, so be Sober and Fervent, and Hope to the End: Don't give out; let them mock on; bear ye the Contradiction of Sinners constantly, as Obedient Children, that you may receive the Kindness of God, at the Revelation</q> of Jesus Christ. And therefore does the Apostle call them <hi>Strangers,</hi> (a Figurative Speech) People Estranged from the Customs of the World, of new Faith and Manners; and so unknown of the World: And if such Strangers, then not to be Fashioned or Conformed to their pleasing Respects and Honours, whom they were Estranged from: Because the
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:006041_0166_0F646F45826C1248"/>
Strangeness lay in leaving that which was customary and Familiar to them before. The following words (ver. 17.) prove, he used the word <hi>Strangers</hi> in a Spiritual Sense, <hi>Pass the time of your</hi> Sojourning <hi>here in fear;</hi> that is, Pass the time of your being as Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers on Earth in Fear: Not after the Fashions of the World. A Word in the next Chapter further explains his Sense, where he tells the Believers, That <hi>they are a</hi> Peculiar <hi>People;</hi> to wit, a <hi>Distinct,</hi> a <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular</hi> and <hi>Separate People from the rest of the World;</hi> not any longer to fashion themselves according to their Customs: But I don't know how that could be, if they were to live in Communion with the World, in its Respects and Honours; for that is not to be a Peculiar or Separate People from them, but to be like them, because conformable to them.</p>
                  <p>§. XXXV. I shall conclude my Scripture-Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies against these foregoing Respects, with that memorable and close Passage of the Apostle <hi>James,</hi> against Respect to Persons in general, after the World's Fashion: <q>

<pb n="143" facs="unknown:006041_0167_0F646F462A04FD10"/>
                        <hi>Partial</hi> in your selves, and are become Judges of Evil Thoughts?</q> [that is, they knew they did A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss]<note n="*" place="bottom">Verse 8.</note> 
                     <q>If ye fulfil the Royal Law, according to the Scripture, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self, ye do well; but if ye have <hi>Respect to Persons,</hi> ye commit Sin, and are convinced of the Law, as Transgressors.</q> This is so full, there seems nothing left for me to add, or others to object. We are not to <hi>Respect Persons,</hi> that's the first thing: And the next is, If we do, we <hi>commit Sin,</hi> and break the Law: At our own Peril be it. And yet perhaps some will say, <q>That by this we overthrow all manner of Distinction among Men, under their divers Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and introduce a <hi>Reciprocal</hi> and <hi>Relational Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi>
                     </q> in the room of it: But if it be so, I can't help it, the Apostle <hi>James</hi> must answer for it, who has given us this Doctrine for Christian and Apostolical. And yet one greater than he told his Disciples, of whom <hi>James</hi> was one, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                     <q>Ye know, that the Princes of the Gentiles exercise Dominion over them, &amp;c. But it shall not be so among you; but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your Minister; and whosoever will be Chief among you, let him be your Servant:</q> That is, he that affects Rule, &amp; seeks to be Uppermost, shall be esteemed least among you. And to say true, upon the whole matter, whether we regard those early Times of the World, that were Antecedent to the coming of Christ, or soon after, there was yet <hi>a greater Simplicity,</hi> than in the times in which we are fallen. For those <hi>early Times</hi>
                     <pb n="144" facs="unknown:006041_0168_0F646F47C7D186A0"/>
of the World, as bad as they were in other things, were great Strangers to the frequency of these Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: Nay, they hardly used some of them, at least, very rarely. For if we read the Scriptures, such a thing as <hi>My Lord Adam,</hi> (though <hi>Lord</hi> of the World) is not to be found: Nor <hi>My Lord Noah</hi> neither, the <hi>Second Lord</hi> of the Earth; Nor yet <hi>My Lord Abraham,</hi> the Father of the Faithful; nor <hi>My Lord Isaac;</hi> nor My <hi>Lord Jacob:</hi> But much less My <hi>Lord Peter,</hi> and My <hi>Lord Paul,</hi> to be found in the <hi>Bible:</hi> And less <hi>Your Holiness,</hi> or <hi>Your Grace.</hi> Nay, among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the People wore their own <hi>Names</hi> with more Simplicity, and used not the Ceremoniousness of Speech that is now practised among Christians, nor yet any thing like it. My <hi>Lord</hi> Solon, My <hi>Lord</hi> Phocion, My <hi>Lord</hi> Plato, My <hi>Lord</hi> Aristotle, My <hi>Lord</hi> Scipio, My <hi>Lord</hi> Fabius, My <hi>Lord</hi> Cato, My <hi>Lord</hi> Cicero, are not to be read in any of the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> Stories, and yet they were some of the <hi>Sages</hi> and <hi>Heroes</hi> of those great Empires. No, their own Names were enough to distinguish them from other Men, and their Vertue and Employment in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, were their <hi>Titles</hi> of <hi>Honour.</hi> Nor has this Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity yet crept far into the <hi>Latin</hi> Writers, where it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I earnestly beg the Lovers, Users, and Expecters of these Ceremonies, to let this I have writ have some Consideration and Weight with them.</p>
                  <p>§. XXXVI. However Christians are not so Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, as the World think; for they shew Respect too: But the Difference between them lies in the Nature of the Respect they perform, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of it. The World's Respect is an Empty Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, no Soul or Substance in it: The <hi>Christian</hi>'s is a <hi>Solid Thing,</hi> whether by Obedience to Superiors, Love to Equals, or Help and Countenance to Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors. Next, their Reasons and Motives to Honour and Respect, are as wide one from the other: For <hi>Fine Apparel, Empty Titles,</hi> or <hi>Large Revenues,</hi> are
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:006041_0170_0F646F4956B18E18"/>
the World's Motives, being things her Children Worship: But the Christian's Motive, is the sense of his Duty in God's sight; first to <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates;</hi> and then to <hi>Inferior Relations:</hi> And lastly, to <hi>All People,</hi> according to their <hi>Vertue, Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Piety:</hi> Which is far from Respect to the meet Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Men, or having their Persons in <hi>Admiration for Reward;</hi> much less on such mean and base Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Wealth and Sumptuous Raiment.</p>
                  <p>§. XXXVII. We shall easily grant, Our Honour, as our Religion, is more Hidden? and that neither are so discernable by Worldly Men, nor grateful to them. Our Plainness is odd, uncooth, and goes mightily against the Grain; but so does Christian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity too, and that for the same Reasons. But had not the Heathen-Spirit Prevail'd too long under a Christian Profession, it would not be so hard to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Right from the Wrong. O that Christians would look upon themselves with the Glass of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; that which tells true, and gives them an exact Knowledge of themselves! And then let them examine, what in them, and about them, agrees with Christ's Doctrine and Life; and they may soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, whether they are real Christians, or but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens Christened with the Name of Christians.</p>

<pb n="147" facs="unknown:006041_0171_0F646F49EA399DB8"/>
from the Apostle <hi>James,</hi> gives us the sense those Primitive Reformers had of Respect to Persons, in these words, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                        <q>To Respect Persons (here) is to have regard to the outward <hi>Habit</hi> and <hi>Garb:</hi> The Apostle signifies, that such Respecting of Persons is so contrary to true Faith, that they are altogether inconsistent: But if the Pomp, and other Worldly Regards, prevail, and weaken what is of Christ, it's a sign of a <hi>decaying Faith.</hi> Yea, so great is the Glory and Splendor of Christ in a Pious Soul, that all the Glories of the World have no Charms, no Beauty, in comparison of That, unto one so Religiously inclin'd. The Apostle maketh such Respecting of Persons to be repugnant to the <hi>Light (within them)</hi> insomuch, as they who follow those Practices, are condemned from <hi>within themselves.</hi> So that Sanctity ought to be the Reason or Motive of all outward Respect; and that none is to be honoured, upon any account, but Holiness:</q> Thus much <hi>Marlorat.</hi> But if this be true Doctrine, we are much in the Right, in refusing Conformity to the vain Respects of Worldly Men.</p>
                     <p>§. XXXIX. But I shall add to these the Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a Learned, Ancient Writer, who lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 1200 Years since, of great Esteem, namely, <hi>Jerom,</hi> who writing to a Noble Matron, <hi>Celantia,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting her how to live in the midst of her Prosperity and Honours, among many other religious Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, speaks thus: <q>Heed not thy Nobility, nor let that be a Reason for thee to <hi>Take Place of any;</hi>
                           <pb n="148" facs="unknown:006041_0172_0F646F4BADBCC550"/>
Esteem not those of a meaner Extraction to be thy Inferiors; for our Religion admits of no Respect of Persons, nor doth it induce us to repute Men from any External Condition, but from their Inward Frame and Disposition of Minds: It is hereby that we Pronounce Men <hi>Noble</hi> or <hi>Base.</hi> With God, not to serve Sin, is to be Free; and to excel in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is to be Noble: God hath Chosen the Mean and Contemptible of this World, whereby to humble the Great Ones. Besides, it is a Folly for any to boast his Gentility, since all are Equally Esteemed by God. The Ransom of the Poor and Rich cost Christ an Equal Expence of Blood. Nor is it mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial in what State a Man is born; the <hi>New Creature</hi> hath no Distinction. But if we will forget how we all descended from one Father, we ought at least per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually to remember, that we have but <hi>one Saviour.</hi>

                     <p>§. XL. But since I am engaged against these fond and fruitless Customs, (the proper Effects and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of Vain and Proud Minds) let me yet add one Memorable Passage more, as it is related by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Causabon,</hi> in his Discourse of <hi>Use</hi> and <hi>Custom,</hi> where he briefly reports what past between <hi>Sulpitius Severus,</hi> and <hi>Paulinus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nola,</hi> (but such an One as <hi>gave all to Redeem Captives,</hi> whilst others of that Function, that they may shew who is their Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are making many both Beggars and Captives, by Countenancing the Plunder and Imprisonment of Christians for pure Conscience to God) He brings it in thus: <q>He is not counted a civil Man now, of
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:006041_0173_0F646F4C6F8D4B48"/>
late Years amongst us, who thinks it much, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth to subscribe himself Servant, tho' it be to his Equal or Inferior.</q> Yet <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> was once sharply chid by <hi>Paulinus,</hi> for Subscribing himself <hi>his Servant,</hi> in a Letter of his, saying, <q>Take heed hereafter, how thou being from a Servant called into Liberty, dost Subscribe thy self Servant unto one, who is thy Brother and Fellow-Servant; for it is a Sinful Flattery, not a Testimony of Humility, to pay those Honours to a Man, and Sinner, which are due to the one Lord, and one Master, and one God.</q> This Bishop was (as it seems) of Christ's mind, <hi>Why callest thou me</hi> Good? <hi>There is none</hi> Good, <hi>but One.</hi> By this we may see, the sense of some of the more Apostolical Bishops, about the Civilities and Fashions, so much reputed with People that call themselves Christians and Bishops, and who would be thought their Successors. 'Twas then a Sin, 'tis now an Accomplishment; 'Twas then a Flattery, 'tis now Respect; 'Twas then fit to be severely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and now, alas, it is to deserve severe Reproof not to use it. O <hi>monstrous Vanity!</hi> How much, how deeply, have those who are called Christians, revolted from the Plainness of the Primitive Days, and Practice of holy Men and Women in former Ages? How are they become degenerated into the loose, proud and wanton Customs of the World, which knows not God; to whom Use hath made these things; condemned by Scripture, Reason and Example, almost Natural? And so insensible are they
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:006041_0174_0F646F4CED1E04B0"/>
of both their Cause and bad Effects, that they not only continue to Practise them, but Plead for them, and Unchristianly make a very Mock of those who cannot Imitate them. But I shall proceed to what remains yet further to be said in our defence, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining another Custom, which helps to make us so much the Stumbling-block of this light, vain, and inconsiderate Age.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>§. 1. THere is another piece of our Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the World, that renders us very <hi>Clownish</hi> to the Breeding of it, and that is, <hi>Thou</hi> for <hi>You,</hi> and that without difference or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to Persons: A thing that to some looks so Rude, it cannot well go down without Derision or Wrath. But as we have the same Original Reason for declining this as the fore-going Customs, so I
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:006041_0175_0F646F4DB3B6AD90"/>
shall add, what to me looks Reasonable in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; though it is very probable, <hi>Height</hi> of <hi>Mind</hi> in some of those that blame us, will very hardly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to believe, that the word Reasonable is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable with so silly a Practice as this is esteemed.</p>
                  <p>§. II. <hi>Words</hi> of themselves are but as so many Marks set and employed for necessary and Intelligible <hi>Mediums,</hi> or Means, whereby Men may understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly express their Minds and Conceptions to each other; from whence comes Conversation. Now, though the World be divided into many Nations, each of which, for the most part, have a peculiar Language, Speech or Dialect; yet have they ever concurred in the same Numbers and Persons, as much of the Ground of Right Speech. For Instance; <hi>I love, Thou lovest, He loveth</hi> are of the <hi>singular Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> importing but <hi>One,</hi> whether in the <hi>first second</hi> or <hi>third Person:</hi> Also, <hi>We love, Ye love, They love,</hi> are of the <hi>Plural Number,</hi> because in each is implied more then One. Which undeniable <hi>Grammatical Rule</hi> might be enough to satisfie any, that have not forgot their <hi>Accidence,</hi> that we are not beside Reason in our Practice. For if <hi>Thou lovest,</hi> be <hi>Singular;</hi> and <hi>You love,</hi> be <hi>Plural;</hi> and if <hi>Thou lovest,</hi> signifies but <hi>One;</hi> and <hi>You love, many;</hi> is it not as proper to say, Thou lovest, to <hi>Ten</hi> Men, as to say, You love, to <hi>One</hi> Man? Or, why not <hi>I love,</hi> for <hi>We love,</hi> and <hi>We love,</hi> instead of <hi>I love?</hi> Doubtless it is the same, though most <hi>Improper,</hi> and in Speech <hi>Ridiculous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. III. Our <hi>next Reason</hi> is; If it be <hi>Improper</hi> or
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:006041_0176_0F646F4E6D3FEC60"/>
                     <hi>Uncivil</hi> Speech (as termed by this vain Age) how comes it, that the <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Authors, used in <hi>Schools,</hi> and <hi>Universities,</hi> have no other? Why should they not be a <hi>Rule</hi> in that, as well as other things? And why, I pray, then are we so Ridiculous for being thus far <hi>Grammatical?</hi> Is it reasonable that <hi>Children</hi> should be <hi>Whipt</hi> at School for putting <hi>You</hi> for <hi>Thou,</hi> as having made <hi>false Latin,</hi> and yet that we must be, tho' not <hi>Whipt,</hi> Reproached, and often Abused, when we use the same <hi>Propriety of Speech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. IV. But in the Third Place, It is neither <hi>Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> nor <hi>Uncivil,</hi> but much the contray; because it is used in all Languages, Speeches and Dialects, and that through all Ages. This is very plain: As for Example, It was <hi>God</hi>'s Language when he first spake to <hi>Adam,</hi> 
                     <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                     <hi>Hebrew:</hi> Also it is the <hi>Assyrian Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean, Grecian</hi> and <hi>Latin Speech.</hi> And now amongst the <hi>Turks, Tartars, Muscovites, Indians, Persians, Italians, Spaniards, French, Dutch, Germans, Poloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Swedes, Danes, Irish, Scottish, Welch,</hi> as well as <hi>English,</hi> there is a Distinction preserved; and the word <hi>Thou,</hi> is not lost in the word which goes for <hi>You.</hi> And though some of the Modern Tongues have done as we do; yet upon the same Error. But by this 'tis plain that <hi>Thou</hi> is no upstart, nor yet Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper; but the only <hi>proper Word</hi> to be used in all Languages to a <hi>single Person;</hi> because otherwise all Sentences, Speeches and Discourses may be very Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, Uncertain, and Equivocal. If a <hi>Jury</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a <hi>Verdict,</hi> or a <hi>Judge</hi> a <hi>Sentence (three</hi> being
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:006041_0177_0F646F4F2B286A88"/>
at the <hi>Bar</hi> upon <hi>three</hi> occasions, very differingly culpable) and should say, <hi>You are here Guilty and to dye,</hi> or <hi>Innocent and Discharg'd;</hi> who knows who is Guilty or Innocent? May be but <hi>One,</hi> perhaps <hi>Two;</hi> or it may be, all <hi>Three.</hi> Therefore our Indictments run in the <hi>Singular Number,</hi> as, <hi>Hold up</hi> Thy <hi>Hand:</hi> Thou <hi>art indicted by the</hi> Name <hi>of &amp;C. for that</hi> Thou, <hi>not having the fear of God, &amp;c.</hi> And it holds the same in all Conversation. Nor can this be avoided but by many unnecessary Circumlocutions. And as the preventing of such Length and Obscurity was doubtless the first Reason for the Distinction, so can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not that be justly disused, till the Reason be first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; which can never be, whilst Two are in the World.</p>
                  <p>§. V. But this is not all: It was first ascribed in way of <hi>Flattery</hi> to Proud Popes and Emperors; imitating the Heathens vain Homage to their Gods; thereby ascribing a <hi>Plural</hi> Honour to a <hi>single</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; as if <hi>One</hi> Pope had been made up of <hi>many</hi> Gods, and <hi>One</hi> Emperor of <hi>many</hi> Men. For which Reason, <hi>You,</hi> only to be used to <hi>many,</hi> became first spoken to <hi>One.</hi> It seems the word <hi>Thou,</hi> look't like too <hi>lean</hi> and <hi>thin</hi> a <hi>Respect;</hi> and therefore some, <hi>Bigger</hi> than they should be, would have a <hi>Stile suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to their own <hi>Ambition:</hi> A Ground we cannot build our Practice on; for what begun it, only loves it still. But supposing <hi>You</hi> to be Proper to a Prince, it will not follow it is to a common Person. For his Edict runs, We <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Require,</hi> because perhaps
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:006041_0178_0F646F4FEC6E6B90"/>
in <hi>Conjunction</hi> with his <hi>Council;</hi> and therefore <hi>You to a private Person,</hi> is an Abuse of the Word. But as <hi>Pride</hi> first gave it Birth, so hath she only promoted it. <hi>Mounsier, Sir,</hi> and <hi>Madam,</hi> were, originally, Names given to none but the King, his Brother, and their Wives, both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> yet now <hi>the Plow-man</hi> in <hi>France</hi> is called <hi>Mounsier,</hi> and his Wise <hi>Madam:</hi> And men of ordinary Trades in <hi>England, Sir,</hi> and their Wives, <hi>Dame;</hi>

                     </note> (which is the Legal Title of a <hi>Lady</hi>) or else <hi>Mistress,</hi> which is the same with <hi>Madam</hi> in French. So prevalent hath <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Flattery</hi> been in all Ages, the one to <hi>give,</hi> and the other to <hi>receive Respect,</hi> as they term it. <hi>See Howel's History of</hi> France in these things.</p>
                  <p>§. VI. But some will tell us, <hi>Custom should rule us;</hi> and <hi>that it is against us.</hi> But it is easily answered, and more truly; That though in <hi>things reasonable</hi> or <hi>indifferent,</hi> Custom is obliging or harmless; yet in things <hi>Unreasonable</hi> or <hi>unlawful,</hi> she has no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For Custom can no more change Numbers than Genders, nor Yoke <hi>One</hi> and <hi>You</hi> together, than make a Man into a Woman; or One a Thousand. But if Custom be to conclude us, 'tis for us. For as Custom is nothing else but <hi>Ancient Usage,</hi> I appeal to the Practice of Mankind, from the beginning of the World, through all <hi>Nations,</hi> against the <hi>Novelty</hi> of this Confusion, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> 
                     <hi>You to One Person.</hi> Let Custom, which is Ancient Practice and Fact, issue this Question. Mistake me not: I know <hi>Words</hi> are
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:006041_0179_0F646F51D65627A8"/>
nothing, but as Men give them a Value or Force by use: But then, if you will discharge <hi>Thou,</hi> and that <hi>You</hi> must succeed in its place, let us have a <hi>Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing</hi> Word in the room of <hi>You,</hi> to be used in Speech to <hi>many.</hi> But to use the same word for <hi>One</hi> and <hi>many,</hi> when there are two, and that only to please a <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>haughty</hi> Humour in Man, is not reasonable in our Sense; which, we hope, is <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> tho' not <hi>modish.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. VII. But if <hi>Thou</hi> to a single Person be Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or Uncivil, <hi>God himself, all the holy Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Prophets, Christ Jesus,</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> the <hi>Primitive Saints, all Languages</hi> throughout the World, <hi>and our own Law-Proceedings are Guilty;</hi> which, with Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, were great Presumption to imagine. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, we all know, it is familiar with the most of <hi>Authors,</hi> to <hi>Preface</hi> their Discourses to the <hi>Reader</hi> in the same Language of THEE and THOU: As, <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> Thou <hi>art desired, &amp;c.</hi> Or, <hi>Reader, This is writ to inform</hi> Thee <hi>of the Occasion, &amp;c.</hi> And it cannot be denied, that the most famous <hi>Poems,</hi> dedicated to <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Majesty,</hi> are writ in this Stile, Read of each in <hi>Chaucer, Spencer, Waller, Cowley, Dryden, &amp;c.</hi> Why then should it be so Homely, Ill-bred, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable in us? This, I conceive, can never be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</p>
                  <p>§. VIII. I doubt not at all, but that something altogether as <hi>Singular,</hi> attended the Speech of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Disciples:</hi> For I remember it was urged upon <hi>Peter</hi> in the High Priest's Palace, as a <hi>Proof</hi> of his
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:006041_0180_0F646F525AF323B0"/>
belonging to Jesus, when he denied his Lord: <hi>Surely</hi> (said they<note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 26. 71, 73, 74.</note>) <hi>thou also art one of them; for thy Speech bewrayeth thee.</hi> They had guess'd by his <hi>Looks,</hi> but just before <hi>that he had been with Jesus;</hi> but when they discoursed him, his <hi>Language</hi> put them all out of doubt: <hi>Surely,</hi> then <hi>he was one of them,</hi> and <hi>he had been with</hi> Jesus. Something it was he had learn'd in his Company, that was <hi>Odd and Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> to be sure, not of the World's Behaviour. Without question, the <hi>Garb, Gate</hi> and <hi>Speech</hi> of his Followers differed, as well as his Doctrine, from the World; for it was a part of his Doctrine it should be so. It is easie to believe, they were more <hi>Plain, Grave,</hi> and <hi>Precise;</hi> which is more credible, from the way which <hi>Poor, Confident, Fearful Peter</hi> took, to disguise the business; for he fell to <hi>Cursing</hi> and <hi>Swearing.</hi> A sad shift! But he thought that the <hi>likeliest</hi> way to remove the Suspicion, that was most <hi>Unlike Christ.</hi> And the <hi>Policy</hi> took; for it <hi>silenced</hi> their Objections; and <hi>Peter</hi> was as Orthodox as they. But tho' they found him not out, the <hi>Cocks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Crow</hi> did; which made <hi>Peter</hi> remember his Dear Suffering Lord's words, and <hi>he went forth, and Wept bitterly;</hi> that he had denied his Master, who was then delivered up to <hi>Dye</hi> for him.</p>
                  <p>§. IX. But our <hi>last Reason</hi> is of most weight with me; and because, <hi>Argumentum ad Hominem,</hi> it is most heavy upon our <hi>Despisers,</hi> which is this: <hi>It should not therefore be urged upon us, because it is a most extravagant piece of</hi> Pride <hi>in a mortal Man, to

BUt <hi>Pride</hi> stops not here; she excites Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to an <hi>Excessive Value and Care of their Persons;</hi> They must have Great and Punctual Attendance, Stately Furniture, Rich and Exact Apparel: All which help to make up that <hi>Pride of Life,</hi> that <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>is not of the Father, but of the World</hi>

                  <p>§. II. That People are generally <hi>Proud of their Persons,</hi> is too visible and troublesome? especially if they have any pretence either to <hi>Blood</hi> or <hi>Beauty:</hi> The one has raised many <hi>Quarrels</hi> among Men; and the other among Women, and Men, too often, for their sakes, and at their Excitements.

                     <hi>first:</hi> What a Puther has this <hi>Noble Blood</hi> made in the World, <hi>Antiquity</hi> of <hi>Name</hi> or <hi>Family,</hi> whose <hi>Father,</hi> or <hi>Mother, Great Grand-Father,</hi> or <hi>Great Grand-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> was best <hi>Descended</hi> or <hi>Allied?</hi> What <hi>Stock,</hi> or What <hi>Class</hi> they came of?

For <hi>first,</hi> What matter is it of whom any one is <hi>Descended,</hi> that is not of Ill Fame; since 'tis his own <hi>Vertue</hi> that must Raise, or <hi>Vice</hi> Depress him? An Ancestor's Character is no Excuse to a Man's <hi>Ill Actions,</hi> but an Aggravation of his Degeneracy: And since <hi>Vertue</hi> comes not by <hi>Generation,</hi> I neither am the better nor the worse for my <hi>Fore-Father:</hi> To be sure, not in God's Account; nor should it be in Man's. No body would endure Injuries the easier, or reject Favours the more, for coming by the hand of a Man well or ill Descended. I consess, it were greater Honour to have had no <hi>Blots,</hi> and with an Hereditary Estate, to have had a <hi>Lineal Descent</hi> or <hi>Worth:</hi> But that was never found, no, not in the most <hi>Blessed</hi> of <hi>Families</hi> upon Earth, I mean <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's.</hi> To be Descended of <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Titles,</hi> fills no Man's Head with <hi>Brains,</hi> or Heart with <hi>Truth:</hi> Those Qualities come from an higher Cause, 'Tis Vanity then, and most Condemnable Pride, for a Man of Bulk and Character, to despise another of <hi>Less Size</hi> in the World, and of <hi>Meaner Alliance</hi> for want of them; because the <hi>latter</hi> may have the

                  <p>§. IV. O, says the <hi>Person proud of Blood, It was never good World, since we have had so many Upstart</hi> Gentlemen! But what should others have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

If <hi>Vertue</hi> then give Nobility, which <hi>Heathens</hi> themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, then <hi>Families</hi> are no longer truly Noble, than they are Vertuous.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and <hi>Debauchery</hi> that now rages among too many of our Greater sort of Folks, is too clear and casting an Evidence in the point: And pray tell me, Of what <hi>Blood</hi> are they come?</p>
                  <p>§. VII. Howbeit, when I have said all this I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not, by <hi>Debasing</hi> one false Quality, to make <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent</hi> another that is not true. I would not be tho't to set the Churle upon the present Gentleman's Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; by no means: His Rudeness will not mend the matter. But what I have writ, is to give Aim to all, where true Nobility dwells, that every one may arrive at it by the ways of Vertue and Goodness. But for all this, I must allow a great Advantage to the Gentleman; and therefore prefer his Station, just as the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> who after he had humbled the <hi>Jews,</hi> that insulted upon the <hi>Christians</hi> with their <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Rites,</hi> gave them the Advantage upon all other Nations in <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Judgments.</hi> I must grant, that the Condition of our Great Men is much to be preferr'd to the Ranks of <hi>Inferior People.</hi> For, <hi>Ist,</hi> They have more Power to do good; And, if

But because it too often happens, that Great Men do little mind to give God the Glory of their Prosperity, and to live answerable to his Mercies; but on the contrary, live <hi>without God in the World,</hi> fulfilling the <hi>Lusts</hi> thereof, his hand is often seen, either in <hi>Impoverish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>Extinguishing</hi> them, and raising up Men of more Vertue and Humility to their Estates and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. However, I must allow, that among People of this Rank, there have been some of them of more than ordinary Vertue, whose <hi>Examples</hi> have given <hi>Light</hi> to their Families.

to see, how much it is possible for some to be taken with Themselves, as if nothing else deserved their Regard, or the <hi>good Opinion</hi> of Others. It would abate their Folly, if they could find in their Hearts to spare but half the time to think of God and their <hi>latter End,</hi> which they most prodigally spend in <hi>Washing, Persuming, Painting, Patching, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring</hi> and <hi>Dressing:</hi> In these things they are <hi>Precise</hi> and very <hi>Artificial;</hi> and for Cost they spare not. But that which aggravates the Evil is, the <hi>Pride</hi> of <hi>One</hi> might comfortably <hi>Supply</hi> the <hi>Need</hi> of <hi>Ten. Gross Impiety, that it is, that a Nation's Pride should not be spared to a Nation's Poor!</hi> But what is this for at last? Only to be Admired, to have Reverence, draw Love, and command the Eyes and Affections of Beholders. And so <hi>Fantastick</hi> are they in it, as hardly to be pleased too. Nothing is good, or fine, or fashionable enough for them. <hi>The Sun</hi> it self, <hi>the Blessing of Heaven, and Comfort of the Earth,</hi> must not shine upon them, left it <hi>Tan</hi> them; nor the <hi>Wind</hi> blow, for fear it should disorder them. O <hi>Impious Nicity!</hi> Yet while they value themselves above all else, they make themselves the <hi>Vassals</hi> of their own <hi>Pride:</hi> Worshipping their <hi>Shape, Feature</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,</hi> which so ever is their Excellency.

But in <hi>Married People,</hi> the Sin is aggravated; for they have none of right to please, but one another; and to affect the <hi>Gayety</hi> and <hi>Vanity of youth,</hi> is an ill sign of loving and living well at Home: It looks rather like <hi>dressing</hi> for a Market. It has sad Effects in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; <hi>Discontents, Partings, Duels, Poysonings</hi> and other <hi>Infamous Murders.</hi> No Age can better tell us the sad Effects of this sort of Pride, than this we live in; as, how <hi>Excessive</hi> Wanton, so how <hi>Fatal</hi> it has been to the <hi>Sobriety, Vertue, Peace</hi> and <hi>Health</hi> of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in this Kingdom.</p>

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Work</hi> for Repentance. But the <hi>Homely</hi> are yet worse; they are Proud of what they <hi>never had,</hi> nor never can have. Nay, their Persons seem as if they were given for a <hi>Perpetual Humiliation</hi> to their Minds, and to be proud of them, is loving Pride for <hi>Prides sake,</hi> &amp; to be proud without a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to be proud. And yet in my whole Life I have Observ'd nothing more <hi>doting</hi> on it self: A strange Infatuation and Inchantment of Pride! What! Not to see right with their Eyes, because of the Partiality of their Minds? <hi>This self-Love is blind

indeed.</hi> But to add <hi>Expence</hi> to the Vanity, and to be <hi>Costly</hi> upon That which can't be mended; One would think they should be down-right Mad: Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if they consider that they look the Homelier for the things that are thought Handsom, and do but thereby draw their Deformity more into notice, by that which does so little become them.</p>
                  <p>But in such Persons <hi>Follies</hi> we have a <hi>Specimen</hi> of Man; what a Creature he is in his <hi>Lapse</hi> from his <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Image.

§. 1. To Conclude this great Head of <hi>Pride,</hi> let us briefly see upon the whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what is the Character of a Proud Man in himself, and in divers Relations and Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities. A Proud Man then is a kind of Glutton upon himself; for he is never satisfied with loving and admiring himself; whilst nothing else, with him, is worthy either of Love or Care: If good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be the <hi>Servant</hi> of his Will, 'tis as much as he can find in his Heart to allow: As if he had been only made for himself, or rather that he had made himself. For as he despises Man, because he cannot abide an Equal, so he does not love God, because he would not have a Superior: He cannot bear to owe his Being to another, lest he should thereby acknowledge One above himself. He is one that is mighty big with the Honour of his <hi>Ancestors,</hi> but not of the Vertue that brought them to it; much less will he trouble himself to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itate them. He can tell you of his Pedigree, his Antiquity, what Estate, what Matches, but forgets that they are gone, and that he must die too.</p>
                  <p>§. II. But how troublesome a Companion is proud Man! Ever Positive and Controuling; and if you yield not, Insolent and Quarrelsom: Yet at the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot of the Matter, Cowardly: But if strongest, Cruel. He has no Bowels of Adversity, as if it were below him to be sensible: He feels no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of other Men's Miseries, than if he were not a Man, or it were a Sin to be sensible. For not feeling
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:006041_0201_0F646F65ADF430D0"/>
himself interested, he looks no further: He will not disquiet his Thoughts with other Men's Infelicities: It shall content him to believe they are Just: And he had rather Churlishly upbraid them as the Cause, than be ready to Commiserate or Relieve them. So that Compassion and Charity are with him as useless, as Humility and Meekness are hateful.</p>
                  <p>§. III. A Proud Person makes an ill Child, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and Subject: He contemns his Parents, Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Prince: He will not be Subject. He thinks himself too wise, or too old, to be directed; as if it were a slavish Thing to obey; and that none were free, that may not do what they please; which turns Duty out of Doors, and degrades Authority. On the other hand, if it be an Husband, or Father, or Master, there is scarcely any enduring. He is so insufferable Curious and Testy, that 'tis an Affliction to live with him: For hardly can any Hand carry it even enough to please him. Some Piccadillio about his Clothes, his Diet, his Lodging or Attendance, quite disorders him: But especially if he fancies any Want in the State and Respect he looks for. Thus Pride destroys the Nature of Relations: On the one side, it learns to contemn Duty; and on the other side, it turns Love into Fear, and makes the Wife a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and the Children and Servants, Slaves.</p>
                  <p>§. IV. But the proud Man makes an ill Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour too; for he is an Enemy to Hospitality: He despises to receive Kindness, because he would not shew any, nor be thought to need it. Besides, it
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:006041_0202_0F646F6670184180"/>
looks too Equal and Familiar for his Haughty Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. Emulation and Detraction are his Element; for he is jealous of Attributing any Praise to others, where Just, left that should cloud and lessen him to whom it never could be due: He is the Man that fears, what he should wish, to wit, <hi>That others should do well.</hi> But that is not all; he maliciously miscalls their Acts of Virtue, which his Corruptions will not let him imitate, that they may get no Credit by them. If he wants any Occasion of doing Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, he can make one; either, they use him ill, or have some Design upon him; t'other Day they paid him not the Cap and Knee; the Distance and Respect he thinks his Quality, Parts or Merits do require. A small Thing serves a proud Man to pick a Quarrel; Of all Creatures the most Jealous, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, Spightful and Revengeful: He can no more forgive an Injury, than forbear to do one.</p>
                  <p>§. V. Nor is this all; a proud Man can never be a Friend to any Body. For besides that his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition may always be brib'd by Honour and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to betray that Relation, he is unconversible; He must not be Catechis'd and Counsel'd, much less Reprov'd or Contradicted: No, he is too co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous of himself to spare another Man a share, and much too High, Stiff, and Touchy: He will not away with those <hi>Freedoms</hi> that a Real Friendship re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. To say true, he contemns the Character; it is by too much familiar and humble for him: His Mighty Soul would know nothing besides himself
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:006041_0203_0F646F6755526790"/>
and Vassals to stock the World. He values o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men as we do Cattel, for their Service only; and if he could, would use them so; but as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, the Number and Force are Unequal.</p>
                  <p>§. VI. But a <hi>Proud Man</hi> in Power is very <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous;</hi> for his <hi>Pride</hi> is the more dangerous by his <hi>Greatness,</hi> since from Ambition in private men, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>Tyranny</hi> in them: It would Reign alone; nay, <hi>live so,</hi> rather than have <hi>Competitors: Aut Caesar, out Nullus.</hi> Reason must not check it, nor Rules of Law limit it; and either it can do no Wrong, or 'tis Sedition to Complain of the Wrong that it does. The men of this Temper would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thought Amiss they do; at least, they count it dangerous to allow it to be so, though so it be; for that would Imply they had Erred, which it is always matter of State to deny. No, they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuse to Perish obstinately, than by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, yield away the Reputation of better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Inferiors; though it were their Prudence to do so. And indeed, 'tis all the satisfaction that Proud Great men make to the World for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series they often bring upon it, that, first or last, upon a Division, they leave their real Interest to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low some one Excess of humour, and are almost ever destroyed by it. This is the End Pride gives proud men, and the <hi>Ruin</hi> it brings upon them, after it has punisht others by them.</p>
                  <p>§. VII. But above all things, Pride is Intolerable in Men pretending to Religion; and, of them, in
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:006041_0204_0F646F67F2071930"/>
Ministers; for they are Names of the greatest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. I speak without Respect, or Anger to Persons or Parties; for I only touch upon the Bad of All. What shall Pride do with Religion, That Rebukes it? or Ambition with Ministers, whose very Office is Humility? And yet there are but too many of them, That, besides an Equal Guilt with others in the fleshly Pride of the World, are even proud of that Name and Office, which ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to mind them of Self-denial. Yea, they use it as the <hi>Beggars</hi> do the Name of God and Christ, only to get by it: Placing to their own Account the Advantages of that Reverend Profession, and thereby making their Function but a Politick Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to raise themselves to the Great Preferments of the World. But O then! how can such be His Ministers, that said, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World?</hi> Who, of Mankind, more <hi>Self-conceited</hi> than these Men? If Contradicted, as Arrogant and Angry, as if it were their Calling to be so. Counsel one of them, he Scorns you; Reprove him, and he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ready to Excommunicate you. <hi>I am a Minister and an Elder:</hi> Flying thither to secure himself from the reach of Just Censure, which indeed exposes him but the more to it: And therefore his Fault can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Less, by how much 'tis worse in a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to do Ill, and Spurn at Reproof, than an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Man.</p>
                  <p>§. VIII. O but he pleads an Exemption by his Office! What I shall he Breed up Chickens to pick
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:006041_0205_0F646F68A9984CD8"/>
out his own Eyes? Be Rebuked or Instructed by a Lay-man, or Parishioner! A man of less Age, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Ability! No such matter: He would have us believe that his Ministerial Prerogative has placed him out of the Reach of Popular Impeachment. He is not subject to Vulgar Judgments. Even Questions about Religion are Schism: Believe as he says: 'Tis not for you to pry so curiously into the Mysteries of Religion: Never good day since Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men medled so much with the Ministers Office. Not considering, poor Man, that the contrary is most true; Not many good days since Ministers medled so much in Lay-mens business. Though perhaps there is little reason for the Distinction, besides Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Gifts, and the Improvement of them by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent use of them for the Good of others.</p>
                  <p>Such good sayings as these, <q>Be ready to Teach, Answer with Meekness: Let every man speak as of the Gift of God, that is in him: If any thing be revealed to him that fits by, let the first hold his Peace; Be not Lords over God's Heritage, but Meek and Lowly; Washing the Feet of the People, as Jesus did those of his poor Disciples;</q>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. 2. 24, 25. Tit. 3. 1 Cor. 14. 30.</note> are Unreasonable and Antiquated Instructions with some Clergy, and little less than Heresie to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them of these things: To be sure, a Mark of great Dis-affection to the Church in their Opinion. For by this time their Pride has made them the Church, and the People but the Porch at best: A
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:006041_0206_0F646F6AC23FAB18"/>
Cypher that signifies nothing, unless They clap their Figure before it: Forgetting, that if they were as good as they should be, they could be but Ministers, Stewards and Under Shepherds; that is, Servants to the Church, Family, Flock and Heritage of God; and not that they are that Church, Family, Flock and Heritage which they are only Servants unto. Remember the Words of Christ,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mat. 20. 26.</note>

                  <p>§. IX. There is but one place to be found in the holy Scripture, where the word <hi>Clerus (kleros)</hi> can properly be applied to the <hi>Church,</hi> and they have got it to themselves; From thence they call themselves the <hi>Clergy,</hi> that is, the Inheritance or Heritage of God<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Pet. 5. 3.</note> Whereas <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts the Ministers of the Gospel, <q>Not to be Lords over God's Heritage, nor to feed them for filthy Lucre.<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. 5. 2, 3.</note>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> (be like) fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw Pride and Avarice to be the Ministers Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and indeed they have often proved their Fall: And to say true, they could hardly fall by worse. Nor is there any excuse to be made for them in these two Respects, which is not worse than their Sin. For if they have not been <hi>Lords over God's Heritage,</hi> it is because they have made themselves that Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and Dis-inherited the People: So that now they may be the Peoples Lords with a Salvo to good Old <hi>Peter's</hi> Exhortation.</p>
                  <p>And for the other Sin of Avarice they can only avoid it, and speak Truth, thus, that never feeding the
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:006041_0207_0F646F6B41F26DA8"/>
Flock, They cannot be said to feed it for Lucre: That is, They get the Peoples Money for Nothing. An Example of which is given us by the Complaint of God himself from the Practice of the <q>
                        <note n="‖" place="bottom">Isa. 55. 2.</note> Proud, Covetous false Prophets <hi>of Old,</hi> That the People gave their Money for that which was not Bread, and their Labour for that which did not profit them:</q> And why? Because then the Priest had no Vision; and too many now despise it.</p>
                  <p>§. X. But alas! when all is done, what Folly, as well as Irreligion, is there in Pride! It cannot <hi>add one Cubit</hi> to any mans Stature: What Crosses can it hinder? What Disappointments help, or harm frus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate? It delivers not from the Common Stroke; Sickness Disfigures, Pain Mis-shapes, and Death Ends the Proud Man's Fabrick. Six Foot of Cold Earth bounds his big Thoughts; and his Person, that was too good for any place, must at last lodge within the strait limits of so little and so dark a Cave: And who thought nothing well enough for him, is quickly the Entertainment of the lowest of all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, even Worms themselves. Thus Pride and Pomp come to the Common End: but with this difference, less Pity from the Living, and more Pain to the Dying. The Proud Man's Antiquity cannot secure him from Death, nor his Heraldry from Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Titles of Honour vanish at this Extremity, and no Power or Wealth; no Distance or Respect can rescue or insure them. <hi>As the Tree falls, it lies;</hi> and <hi>as Death leaves men, Judgment finds them:</hi>

§. XI. O, what can Prevent this Ill Conclusion? And what can Remedy this Woful Declension from Ancient Meekness, Humility and Piety, and that Godly Life and Power which were so Conspicuous in the Authority of the Preachings and Examples of the Living of the first and Purest Ages of Christian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity! Truly, nothing but an Inward and Sincere Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination by the Testimony of the holy <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of Jesus, of the Condition of their Souls and Minds towards Christ, and a better Inquiry into the Matter and Examples of holy Record.

Thou must bring thy Deeds to it, and Examine them by that holy Lamp in thy Soul, which is the Candle of the Lord, that shews thee thy Pride and Arrogancy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves thy Delight in the vain Fashions of this World. Religion is a <hi>Denial of Self;</hi> yea, of Self-Religion too. It is a firm Tye or Bond upon the Soul to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, whose End is Happiness; for by it men come to see the Lord. <hi>The pure in Heart</hi> (says Jesus) <hi>see God:</hi>

which leads them to break Christ's holy Will, and lose their own Souls, in doing the Devil's. Had <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> minded that holy <hi>Light</hi> in Paradise more than the Serpent's Bait, and stayed his mind upon his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, the Rewarder of Fidelity, he had seen the Snare of the Enemy, and Resisted him. O do not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in that which is Forbidden! Look not upon it, if thou wouldst not be Captivated by it. Bring not the Guilt of Sins of Knowledge upon thy own Soul.

It brancheth it self into these <hi>three parts;</hi> 1st, <hi>Desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Unlawful Things,</hi> 2dly, <hi>Unlawfully desiring of Lawful Things.</hi> And Lastly, <hi>Hoarding up, or unprofitably withholding the Benefit of them from the Relief of private Persons, or the Publick.</hi> I shall first deliver the sense of Scripture, and what <hi>Examples</hi> are therein afforded against this Impiety: And next, my own <hi>Reasons,</hi> with some <hi>Authorities</hi> from Authors of Credit. By which it will appear, That the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Love of Riches out of the Hearts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is as much the Business of the <hi>Cross of Christ,</hi> as any one Sin that Man is fallen into.</p>
                  <p>§. II. And First, of <hi>Desiring or Coveting of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful things:</hi> It is expresly Forbidden by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in the Law he delivered to <hi>Moses</hi> upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> for a Rule to his People, the <hi>Jews,</hi> to walk by:<note n="‖" place="bottom">Exod. 20.

Therefore was it said of old, <hi>Wo to them that covet an evil Covetousness.</hi> This is to our point. We have many remarkable Instances of
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:006041_0212_0F646F6EE8A113C8"/>
this in Scripture; two of which I will briefly report.</p>
                  <p>§. III. <hi>David,</hi> though otherwise a good Man, by Unwatchfulness is taken; the Beauty of <hi>Uriah's</hi> Wife was too hard for him, being disarm'd and off from his Spiritual Watch. There was no Disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive would do: <hi>Uriah</hi> must be put upon a Despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Service, where it was great odds if he survived it. This was to hasten the Unlawful Satisfaction of his Desires by a way that look'd not like direct Murder. The Contrivance took; <hi>Uriah</hi> is kill'd, and his Wife is quickly <hi>David's.</hi> This interpreted <hi>David's</hi> Covetousness. But went it off so? No, <hi>David</hi> had sharp Sawce with his Meat.<note n="*" place="bottom">Pal. 51. Psal. 77. Psal. 42. 7. Ps. 69. 2. 14. Ps. 6. 6. 7.</note> 
                     <q>His Pleasure soon turn'd to Anguish and Bitterness of Spirit: His Soul was overwhelmed with Sorrow: The Waves went o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his head: He was consumed within him: He was stuck in the Mire and Clay; He cryed, He wept; Yea, his Eyes were as a Fountain of Tears. Guiltiness was upon him, and he must be purged; his Sins washt white as Snow, that were as red as Crimson, or he is undone for ever?</q> His Repentance prevail'd: Behold, what Work this part of Covetousness makes! What Evil, what Sorrow! Oh that the People of this Covetousness would let the sense of <hi>David's</hi> Sorrows sink deep into their Souls, that they might come to <hi>David's</hi> Salvation! <hi>Restore me,</hi> saith that good Man: It seems he once knew a Better State: Yes, and this may teach the better sort to Fear, and stand in Awe
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:006041_0213_0F646F6F9969C490"/>
too, left they Sin, and Fall. For <hi>David</hi> was taken at a Disadvantage: He was off his Watch, and gone from the Cross: The Law was not his Lamp and Light, at that instant: He was a Wanderer from his Safety, his Strong Tower, and so surprised: Then and There it was the Enemy met him, and vanquish'd him.</p>
                  <p>§. IV. The Second Instance is that of <hi>Naboth's</hi> Vineyard: It was coveted by <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabel:</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Kings 21.</note> That which led them to such an Unlawful Desire, found means to accomplish it. <hi>Naboth</hi> must Die, for he would not fell it. To do it, they accuse the Innocent Man of Blasphemy, and find two Knights of the Post, Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> to Evidence against him. Thus, in the Name of God, and in shew of pure Zeal to his Glory, <hi>Naboth</hi> must Die; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly was Stoned to Death. The News of which coming to <hi>Jezabel,</hi> she bid <hi>Ahab</hi> arise and take Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, for <hi>Naboth</hi> was Dead: But God follow'd both of them with his fierce Vengeance. <hi>In the place where the Dogs licked the Blood of Naboth,</hi> (faith <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah</hi> in the Name of the Lord) <hi>shall Dogs lick thy Blood; even thine; and I will bring Evil upon thee, and take away thy Posterity:</hi> And of <hi>Jezabel</hi> (his Wife and Partner in this Covetousness and Murder, he adds) <hi>the Dogs shall cat her Flesh by the Walls of</hi> Jezreel. Here is the Infamy and Punishment due to this Part of Covetousness. Let this deter those that Desire unlawful things; the Rights of others: For God, that is Just, will certainly repay such with
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:006041_0214_0F646F7180C87468"/>
Interest in the End. But perhaps these are Few; either that they don't, or dare not shew it, because the Law will bite if they do. But the Next part hath company Enough, that will yet exclaim against the Iniquity of this part of Covetousness; and by their seeming Abhorrence of it, would excuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of all Guilt in the rest: Let us consider that.</p>
                  <p>§. V. The <hi>Next,</hi> and most common part of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness is, <hi>The unlawful desires of Lawful things, especially of Riches.</hi> Money is Lawful, but the Love of it is the Root of all Evil, if the man of God say true. So Riches are Lawful, but they that pursue them Fall into divers Temptations, Snares &amp; Lusts; if the same good Man say right. He calls them Uncertain, to shew their Folly and Danger, that set their Hearts upon them. Covetousness is hateful to God: He hath denounced great Judgments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those that are Guilty of it. God charged it on <hi>Israel</hi> of old, as one of the Reasons of his Judgments; <q>For the Iniquity of his <hi>Covetousness</hi> (saith God<note n="*" place="bottom">Isa. 57. 17.

                  <p>§. VI. <hi>Peter</hi> was of the same mind<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Pet. 2. 3.</note> for he maketh Covetousness to be one of the great Marks of the false Prophets and Teachers, that should arise among the Christians; and by that they might know them; <hi>who,</hi> saith he, <hi>through</hi> Covetousness <hi>shall with seigned words, make Merchandise of you.</hi> To conclude, Therefore the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> at the end of this Epistle, leaves this (with other things) not without great Zeal and Weight upon them: <hi>Let,</hi> saith he,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Heb. 13. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>your Conversation be</hi> without <hi>Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> (he rests not in this generality, but goes on) <hi>and be</hi> Content <hi>with such things as you have; for God hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</hi> What then? Must we conclude that those who are not Content, but seek to be Rich, have forsaken God? The conclusion seems hard; but yet it is natural:
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:006041_0217_0F646F73EDC46E40"/>
For such, 'tis plain, are not Content with what they have; they would have more; they covet to be Rich, if they may: They live not with those Dependance and Regards to Providence, to which they are exhorted: Nor is <hi>Godliness with Content, great Gain to them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. VII. And truly it is a Reproach to a Man, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the Religious Man, that He knows not when he hath enough; when to leave off; when to be satisfied: That notwithstanding God sends him one plentiful Season of Gain after another, He is so far from making that the cause of withdrawing from the Trafficks of the World, that he makes it a reason of Lanching further into it: As if <hi>the more he hath, the more he may.</hi> He therefore reneweth his Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, bestirs himself more than ever, that he may have his share in the Scramble, while any thing is to be got: This is as if Cumber, not Retirement; and Gain, not Content, were the Duty and Comfort of a Christian. Oh that this thing were better consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd! For by not being so observable, nor obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Law, as other vices are, there is the more Danger for want of that Check. 'Tis plain that most people strive not for Substance, but Wealth. Some there be that love it strongly, and spend it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally when they have got it. Though this be Sinful, yet more commendable than <hi>To love Money for Money's sake</hi> That is one of the basest Passions the Mind of Man can be captivated with: A perfect Lust; and a greater, and more Soul-defiling one

there is not in the whole Catalogue of Concupiscence. Which consider'd, should quicker People into a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Examination, how far this Temptation of Love of Money hath entred them; and the rather, because the steps it maketh into the Mind, are almost insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, which renders the Danger greater. Thousands think themselves unconcern'd in the Caution, that yet are perfectly Guilty of the Evil. How can it be otherwise, when those that have, from a low Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, acquired Thousands, labour yet to advance, yea, double and Treble those Thousands; and that with the same Care and Contrivance by which they got them. Is this to live comfortably, or to be Rich? Do we not see how early they rise; how late they go to Bed? How full of the Change, the Shop, the Warehouse, the Custom-house; of Bills, Bonds, Charter-Parties; &amp;c. they are? Running up and down, as if it were to save the Life of a <hi>condemned Innocent.</hi> An <hi>Insatiable Lust,</hi> and therein ungrateful to God, as well as hurtful to Men, who giveth it to them to use, and not to love: That's the Abuse. And if this Care, Contrivance and Industry, and that continually, be not from the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Money,</hi> in those that have ten times more than they began with, and much more than they spend or need, I know not what Testimony Man can give of his Love to any thing.</p>
                  <p>§. VIII, To conclude, It is an <hi>Enemy to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Magistrates;</hi> for it tends to corruption. Wherefore those that God ordained were such as
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:006041_0219_0F646F756E20A7A0"/>
Feared him, and hated Covetousness. Next it hurts Society; for old Traders keep the young ones poor: And the great reason why some have too little, and so forced to drudge like Slaves to feed their Families, and keep their Chin above Water is, because The Rich hold fast and press to be Richer, and covet more, which dries up the little Streams of profit from smaller Folks. There should be a Standard, both as to the Value and Time of Traffick; and then the Trade of the Master to be shared among his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that deserve it. This were both to help the Young to get their Livelihood, and to give the Old, time to think of leaving this World <hi>well,</hi> in which they have been so busy, that they might obtain a share in the other, of which they have been so careless.</p>
                  <p>§. IX. There is yet another Mischief to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for Covetousness leads Men to abuse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud it, by <hi>Concealing</hi> or <hi>Falsifying</hi> the Goods they deal in: As Bringing in forbidden Goods by stealth; or lawful Goods, so as to avoid the payment of Dues, or owning the Goods of Enemies for Gain; or that they are not well made, or full Measure; With abundance of that sort of Deceit.</p>
                  <p>§. X. But <hi>Covetousness</hi> has caused destructive Feuds in Families: For Estates falling into the hands of those, whose <hi>Avarice</hi> has put them upon drawing greater Profit to themselves, than was consistent with <hi>Justice,</hi> has given Birth to much trouble, and caused great <hi>Oppression.</hi> It too often falling out that such Executors have kept the right Owners out of Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session with the Money they should pay them.</p>

§. XI. But this is not all; for Covetousness <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays Friendship:</hi> A Bribe cannot be better placed to do an ill thing, or undo a Man. Nay, it is a Murderer too often both of Soul and Body: Of the Soul, because it kills that Life it should have in God: Where Money masters the Mind, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishes all Love to better things: Of the Body, for it will kill for Money, by Assassinations, Poisons, false Witness, &amp;c. I shall end this Head of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness, with the Sin and Doom of two Covetous Men, <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Judas's</hi> Religion fell in Thorny Ground: Love of Money choaked him. Pride and Anger in the <hi>Jews</hi> endeavoured to Murder Christ; but till Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness set her hand to effect it, they were all at a loss. They found <hi>Judas</hi> had the Bag, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably lov'd Money; they would try him, and did. The Price was set, and <hi>Judas</hi> betrays his Master, his Lord (that never did him wrong) into the hands of his most cruel Adversaries. But to do him right, he returned the Money; and to be revenged of him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self, was his own <hi>Hang-man.</hi> A <hi>wicked Act, a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed End.</hi> Come on, you Covetous! What say you now to Brother <hi>Judas?</hi> Was he not an ill Man? Did he not very Wickedly? Yes, yes: Would you have done so? No, no, By no means. Very well; but so said those evil <hi>Jews</hi> of Stoning the Prophets, and that yet crucified the beloved Son of God; he that came to save them and would have done it, if they had received him, and not rejected the day of

their Visitation. Rub your Eyes well, for the dust is got into them; and carefully read in your own Consciences, and see, if, out of love to Money, you have not betray'd the Just One in yourselves, and so are Brethren with <hi>Judas</hi> in Iniquity. I speak for God against an <hi>Idol;</hi> Bear with me! Have you not resisted, yea, quenched, many times, the good Spirit of Christ, in your pursuit after your beloved Wealth?<note n="‖" place="bottom"> 2 Cor. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Examine your selves, try your selves; know you not your own selves, that if Christ dwell not</hi> (if he rule not, and be not above all beloved) <hi>in you, you are Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates;</hi> in an undone condition.</p>
                  <p>§. XII. The other covetous Man is <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom"> Acts 8. 9, to 24.</note> a Believer too; But his Faith could not go deep e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for Covetousness. He would have driven a Bargain with <hi>Peter; So much Money,</hi> for <hi>So much Holy Ghost,</hi> that he might sell it again, and make a good Trade of it; corruptly measuring <hi>Peter</hi> by himself, as if he had only had a better Knack of Couzening the People than himself, who had set up in <hi>Samaria</hi> for the great Power of God, before the Power of God in <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> undeceived the People. But what was <hi>Peter's</hi> Answer and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? <q>Thy Money (says he) perish with thee, thou hast neither Part nor Lot in this matter: Thou art in the Gall of Bitterness, and in the Bond of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</q> A dismal Sentence. Besides, it tends to <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury,</hi> and rises often out of it: For from having much, they spend much, and so become poor by Luxury:
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:006041_0222_0F646F77EE5F4EB0"/>
Such are covetous to get, to spend more, which Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance would prevent. For if Men would not, or could not by good Laws well Executed, and a better Education, be so Lavish in their Tables, Houses, Furniture, Apparel and Gaming, there would be no such Temptation to covet earnestly after what they could not; For there is but here and there a Miser, that loves Money for Money's sake:-</p>
                  <p>§. XIII. Which leads to the last and basest part of <hi>Covetousness,</hi> which is yet the most fordid, to wit, <hi>Hoarding up, or keeping Money unprofitably both to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and themselves too.</hi> This is <hi>Solomon's</hi> Miser, <hi>that is Rich, and hath nothing:</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Pro. 17.</note> A great Sin in the sight of God. He complained of such,<note n="*" place="bottom">Isa. 3. 14. 15.</note> as had <hi>Stored up the labours of the Poor in their Houses;</hi> he calls it <hi>their Spoils,</hi> and that it is <hi>A grinding of the Poor, because they see it not again</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="bottom">Psa. 41. 1. Deut. 15. 7.</note>. But he blesseth those that consider the Poor; and commandeth every one <hi>To open freely to his Brother that is in need;</hi> not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e that is spiritually but naturally so; and not to withhold his gift from the Poor. The Apostle chargeth <hi>Timothy</hi> in the sight of God, and before Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Tim. 6. 17.</note> 
                     <q>That he fail not to charge them that <hi>are Rich</hi> in this World, that they trust not in their uncertain <hi>Riches,</hi> but in the living God, who giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth liberally; and that they do good with them, that they may be <hi>Rich</hi> in good works.</q> Riches are apt to corrupt; and that which keeps them sweet and best, is Charity: He that uses them not, gets them
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:006041_0223_0F646F79D139DDC8"/>
not for the end for which they are given; but loves them for themselves, not their Service. The Avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious is Poor in his Wealth. He wants for fear of spending; and encreases his fear with his hope, which is Gain; and so tortures himself with his Pleasure: The most like to the Man that <hi>hid his Talent in a Napkin,</hi> of all others; for this Man's Talents are hid in his bags out of sight, in Vaults, under Boards, behind Wainscots; else upon Bonds and Mortages, growing but as under Ground; for it doth good to none.</p>
                  <p>§. XIV. This Covetous Man is a Monster in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for he has no <hi>Bowels,</hi> and is like the <hi>Poles,</hi> always <hi>cold.</hi> An Enemy to the State, for he spirits their Money away: A Disease to the Body Politick, for he obstructs the Circulation of the Blood, and ought to be removed by a Purge of the Law: For these are Vices at heart, that destroy by whole-sale. The Covetous, he hates all useful Arts and Sciences as vain, left they should cost him something the learning: Wherefore Ingenuity has no more place in his Mind, than in his Pocket. He lets Houses fall, and High-ways poch, to prevent the charge of Repairs: And for his spare Diet, plain Cloaths, and mean Furniture, he would place them to the Account of Moderation. O Monster of a Man! that can take up the Cross for Covetousness, and not for Christ.</p>
                  <p>§. XV. But he pretends Negatively to some <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> too; for he always rails at Prodigality, the better to cover his Avarice. If you would bestow a Box of <hi>Spikenard</hi> on a good Man's Head, to have
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:006041_0224_0F646F79E9656598"/>
Money and shew Righteous, he tells you of the poor; But if the Poor come, he excuses his want of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the unworthiness of the Object, or the causes of his Poverty, or that he can bestow his Money up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those that deserve it better; who rarely opens his Purse till Quarter-day, for fear of losing it.</p>
                  <p>§. XVI. But he is more Miserable than the Poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est: For <hi>he enjoys not what he yet fears to lose;</hi> they fear not what they don't enjoy. Thus is he Poor by overvaluing his Wealth; but he is wretched, that hungers with Money in his Pocket in a <hi>Cook's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Shop:</hi> Yet having made a God of his Gold, who knows but he thinks it unnatural to Eat what he Worships?</p>
                  <p>§. XVII. But, which aggravates this Sin, I have my self once known some, that to get Money, have wearied themselves into the Grave; and to be true to their Principle, when Sick, would not spare a Fee to a Doctor, to help the poor Slave to <hi>live; and so died to save charges:</hi> A constancy, that canonizes them Martyrs for Money.</p>
                  <p>§. XVIII. But now let us see what Instances the Scripture will give us in reproof of the fordid Hoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Hiders of Money. A good-like <hi>Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Man</hi> came to Christ, and enquired the way to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life: Christ told him,<note n="†" place="bottom">Luke 18.</note> 
                     <hi>He knew the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:</hi> he reply'd, <hi>He had kept them from his Youth</hi> (it seems he was no loose person, and indeed such are usually not so, to save charges) <hi>And yet lackest thou one thing,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Sell all, distribute
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:006041_0225_0F646F7AA7C388F0"/>
it to the Poor, and thou shall have Treasure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and come and follow me.</hi> It seems Christ pinch'd him in the fore place; he hit the mark, and struck him to the Heart, who knew his Heart: By this he tryed how well he had kept the Commandments, <hi>To love God above all.</hi> 'Tis said, <hi>The Young-man was very sorrowful, and went his way;</hi> and the Reason which is given, is, <hi>That he was very rich.</hi> The Tides met, Money and Eternal Life: contrary Desires: But which prevailed? Alas! his Riches. But what said Christ to this? <hi>How hardly shall they that have Riches enter into the Kingdom of God?</hi> He adds, <hi>It is easier for a Camel to go through a Needle's Eye, than for a Rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> That is, such a Rich man, to wit a covetous man, to whom it is hard to do good with what he has: 'Tis more than an Ordinary Miracle. O who then would be Rich and covetous! 'T was upon these rich men, that Christ pronounced his <hi>Woe,</hi> saying, <hi>We unto you that are Rich, for ye have received your consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here:</hi> What! None in the Heavens? No, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you become willing to be Poor-men, can resign all, live loose to the World, have it at Arms End, yea, under Foot, a Servant and not a Master.</p>
                  <p>§. XIX. The other Instance is a very dismal one too: 'Tis that of <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira.</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts 5.</note> In the beginning of Apostolick times it was customary for those who received the Word of Life, to bring what substance they had, and lay it at the <hi>Apostles</hi> Feet: of these <hi>Joses,</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Barnabas,</hi> was exemplary.

Among the rest, <hi>Annanias</hi> and his Wife <hi>Saphir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Whilst it remained, was it not thine own? And after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? Why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? Thou hast not lied unto Men, but unto God.</hi> But what followed this <hi>Covetousness</hi> and <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy</hi> of <hi>Annanias?</hi> Why, <hi>Annanias</hi> hearing these <hi>Words, He fell down and gave up the Ghost.</hi> The like befel his Wife, being <hi>privy</hi> to the <hi>deceit</hi> their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice</hi> had led them to. And it is said, that <hi>great fear came upon all the Church, and those that heard of these things:</hi> And <hi>also should</hi> on those that now read them. For if this Judgment was shewn and record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that we should beware of the like Evils; what will become of those, that under the Profession of <hi>Christianity,</hi> a religion that teaches Men to live loose from the World, and to yield up all to the Will and Service of Christ and his Kingdom, not only retain <hi>a part,</hi> but <hi>all;</hi> and cannot part with the least thing for Christ's sake. I beseech God to encline the Hearts of my <hi>Readers</hi> to weigh these things. This had not befallen <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> if they had acted as in God's presence and with that <hi>entire Love, Truth</hi>
                     <pb n="203" facs="unknown:006041_0227_0F646F7D6E564630"/>
and <hi>Sincerity,</hi> that became them. O that People would use the Light that Christ has given them to search and see, how far they are under the <hi>Power</hi> of this <hi>Iniquity!</hi> For would they but watch against the <hi>love of the World,</hi> and be less in bondage to the things that are seen which are Temporal, they would begin to <hi>set their hearts on things above, that are of an Eternal nature.</hi> Their <hi>Life would be hid with Christ in God, out of the reach of all the</hi> uncertainties <hi>of Time, and Troubles and Changes of Mortality.</hi> Nay, if People would but consider how Hardly Riches are got, how Uncertainly they are kept, the Envy they bring; that they can neither make a man Wife, nor cure diseases, nor add to Life, much less give Peace in Death: No, nor hardly yield any solid benefit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>Food</hi> and <hi>Raiment</hi> (which may be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them) and that if there be any good use for them, 'Tis to <hi>relieve others in Distress;</hi> being but <hi>Stewards</hi> of the plentiful Providences of God, and consequently accountable for our <hi>Stewardship;</hi> If, I say, these considerations had any room in our Minds, we should not thus post to get, nor care to hide, and keep such a mean and impotent thing. O that the <hi>Cross of Christ</hi> (which is the spirit and power of God in Man) might have more place in the Soul, that it might crucifie us more and more to the World, and the World to us; that like the days of Paradise, the Earth might again be the Footstool and the Treasure of the Earth, a Servant, and not a God to Man!—Many have writ against this <hi>Vice;</hi> three I will mention.</p>

§. XX. <hi>William Tindal,</hi> that worthy Apostle of the English Reformation, has an entire Discourse to which I refer the Reader, Entituled, <hi>The Parable of the Wicked Mammon.</hi> The next is—</p>
                  <p>§. XXI. <hi>Peter Charron</hi> (a famous French man, and in particular for the Book he wrote of <hi>Wisdom</hi>) hath a Chapter against <hi>Covetousness,</hi> Part of which take as followeth: <q>To love and effect <hi>Riches</hi> is <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness:</hi> Not only the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Affection,</hi> but also every <hi>over-curious</hi> care and industry about <hi>Riches.</hi> The desire of Goods, and the pleasure we take in possessing of them, is grounded only upon Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The immoderate <hi>desire,</hi> to get Riches it is a <hi>Gangreen</hi> in our Soul, which with a venemous <hi>heat</hi> consumeth our natural Affections, to the end it might fill us with virulent Humours. So soon as it is lodged in our Hearts, all Honest and Natural <hi>Affection,</hi> which we owe either to our <hi>Parents,</hi> or <hi>Friends,</hi> or our <hi>Selves,</hi> vanisheth away: All the rest, in respect of our profit, seemeth nothing; yea, we forget in the end, and condemn our Selves, our Bodies, our Minds, for this transitory <hi>Trash;</hi> and as our Proverb is, <hi>We sell our House to get us Hay. Covetousness</hi> is the vile and base Passion of vulgar <hi>Fools,</hi> who account <hi>Riches</hi> the principal Good of a Man, and fear Poverty, as the greatest Evil; and not contenting themselves with <hi>necessary Means,</hi> which are forbidden no man, weigh that is good in a <hi>Gold-Smith's Ballance,</hi> when Nature hath taught us, to measure it by the Ell of Necessity. For,
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:006041_0229_0F646F7E6C15A8E8"/>
what greater Folly can there be, than to adore that which Nature it self hath <hi>put under our Feet</hi> and <hi>hidden in the Bowels of the Earth, as unworthy to be seen;</hi> yea rather to be contemned, and trampled under foot? This is that which the Sin of man hath only torn out of the Entrails of the Earth, and brought unto Light to kill himself. We dig out the Bowels of the Earth, and bring to light those things, for which we would fight: We are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to esteem those things most highly, which are in the lowest parts of the Earth. Nature seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth even in the first birth of Gold, and the Womb from whence it proceedeth, after a sort, to have presaged the Misery of those that are in love with it; for it hath so ordered the matter, that in those Countries where it groweth, there groweth with it neither Grass, nor Plant, nor other thing that is worth any thing: As giving us to understand thereby, that in those Minds where the desire of this Metal groweth, there cannot remain so much as a spark of true Honour and Vertue. For what thing can be more base, than for a man to degrade, and to make himself a Servant and a Slave to that which should be subject unto him? <hi>Riches serve Wise Men,</hi> but Command a Fool; for a covetous Man serveth his Riches, and not they him: And he is said to have Goods, as he hath a Feaver, which holdeth and tyrannizeth over a man, not he over it. What thing more vile, than to love that which is not good, neither can make a good man?
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:006041_0230_0F646F7F28AD6038"/>
Yea, is common,&amp; in the possession of the most wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of the world; which many times pervert good Manners, but never amend them? Without which so many wise men have made themselves happy, and by which so many Wicked men have come to a wicked End. To be brief; what thing more mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than to bind the Living to the Dead, as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zentius</hi> did, to the end their Death might be lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing, and the more cruel, to tie the Spirit unto the Excrement and Scum of the Earth; to pierce through his own Soul with a thousand Torments, which this amorous Passion of Riches brings with it; and to entangle himself with the ties and cords of this malignant thing, as the Scripture calls them, which doth likewise term them <hi>Thorns</hi> and <hi>Thieves,</hi> which <hi>steal away the heart of Man, Snares of the Devil, Idolatry,</hi> and the <hi>Root</hi> of all <hi>Evil.</hi> And truly, he that shall see the Catalogue of those En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies and Molestations, which Riches ingender into the heart of Man, as their proper Thunder-bolt and Lightning, they would be more hated than they are now loved. Poverty wants many things, but Covetousness all: A Covetous man is good to none, and worse to himself.</q> 
                     <hi>Thus much of</hi> Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, <hi>a wise and great Man. My next Testimony is yielded by an Author not unlikely to</hi> take <hi>with some sort of People for his Wit; may they equally value his Morality, and the Judgment of his riper time.</hi>

Writeth thus:</hi> 
                     <q>There are two sorts of <hi>Avarice;</hi> the one is but a Bastard-kind, and that is a Rapacious Appetite of <hi>Gain;</hi> not for its own sake, but for the pleasure of Refunding it immediately through all the Channels of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Luxury.</hi> The other is the true kind, and properly so called, which is a restless and unsatiable desire of <hi>Riches,</hi> not for any further end or use, but only to hoard, and preserve, and perpetually encrease them. The <hi>Covetous man</hi> of the <hi>first</hi> kind, is like a greedy <hi>Ostridge,</hi> which devoureth any <hi>Metal;</hi> but it is with an intent to feed upon it, and in effect it maketh a shift to digest and excern it. The second is like the foolish <hi>Chough,</hi> which loveth to steal <hi>Money,</hi> only to hide it. The <hi>first</hi> doth much harm to Mankind, and a little good to some few: The <hi>second</hi> doth good to none, no, not to himself. The <hi>first</hi> can make no <hi>excuse</hi> to God or Angels, or rational Men, for his Actions: The <hi>second</hi> can give no <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Colour,</hi> not to the <hi>Devil</hi> himself, for what he doth: He is a <hi>Slave</hi> to <hi>Mammon</hi> without Wages. The first maketh a shift to be beloved, ay, and envied too by some people: The <hi>second</hi> is the Universal Object of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and contempt.

                  <p>§. 1. I Am now come to the other Extream, and that is <hi>Luxury,</hi> which is <hi>An excessive Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of</hi> Self <hi>in Ease and Pleasure.</hi> This is the last great Impiety struck at in this Discourse of the holy <hi>Cross of Christ,</hi> which indeed is much of the subject of its Mortifying Virtue and Power. A Disease as Epidemical, as Killing: It creeps into all Stations and Ranks of men; the Poorest often exceeding their Ability to indulge their Appetite; and the Rich frequently wallowing in those things, that please the Lusts of their Eye and Flesh, and the Pride of Life: as regardless of the Severe <hi>Discipline</hi> of Jesus, whom they call <hi>Saviour,</hi> as if <hi>Luxury</hi> and not the <hi>Cross,</hi> were the ordained way to Heaven. <hi>What shall we eat, What shall we drink, And what shall we put on?</hi> Once the care of <hi>Luxurious Heathens,</hi> is now the <hi>Practice</hi> and (which is worse) the <hi>Study</hi> of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

Christians. But let such be ashamed, and repent; Remembring that <hi>Jesus</hi> did not reproach the <hi>Gentiles</hi> for those things, to indulge his Followers in them; they that will have Christ to be Theirs, must be sure to be his, to be like minded to live in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and Moderation, as knowing the Lord is at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

God Almighty by his Grace, soften their Hearts to Instruction, and shed abroad his tender Love in their Souls, that they may be overcome to Repentance, and to the Love of the holy Way of the <hi>Cross</hi> of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, the blessed Redeemer of Men. For they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that he can benefit them, while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to lay down their Sins for the love of him, that laid down his Life for the Love of them.

§. II. <hi>Luxury</hi> has many parts, and the first that is forbidden by the Self-denying Jesus, is the BELLY: <hi>Take no thought</hi> (says he to his Disciples) <hi>saying, What shall we Eat, or what shall we drink?—for after these things do the</hi> Gentiles <hi>seek:</hi> As if he had said, The uncircumcised, the <hi>Heathen,</hi> such as live without the true God, and make a God of their <hi>Belly,</hi> whose care is to please their Appetite, more then to seek God and his Kingdom: You must not do so, but <hi>seek you first the Kingdom of God, and his Righteousness, and all other things shall be added.</hi> That which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for you, will follow: Let every thing have its time and order.</p>
                  <p>This carries a serious Reprehension to the <hi>Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> Eater and <hi>Drinker,</hi> who is taken up with an excessive Care of his <hi>Palate</hi> and <hi>Belly,</hi> what shall he <hi>Eat,</hi> and what he shall <hi>Drink:</hi> Who being often at a loss what to have next, <hi>Therefore has</hi> an <hi>Officer</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> and a <hi>Cock</hi> to <hi>dress, disguise</hi> and <hi>drownd</hi> the <hi>Species,</hi> that it may cheat the Eye, look New and Strange; and all to excite an Appetite, or raise an admiration. To be sure there is great <hi>Variety,</hi> and that <hi>curious</hi> and <hi>costly:</hi> The <hi>Sauce,</hi> it may be, dearer than the <hi>Meat:</hi> And so full is he fed, that without it he can scarce find out a Stomach; which is to <hi>force</hi> an <hi>Hunger,</hi> rather than to satisfie it.—And as he eats so he drinks; rarely for <hi>Thirst</hi> but <hi>Pleasure;</hi> to please his Palate. For that purpose he will have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Sorts, and he must taste them all: One, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver good, is dull and tiresom; <hi>Variety</hi> is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:006041_0236_0F646F849EAF1270"/>
than the <hi>Best;</hi> &amp; therefore the whole World is little enough to fill his Cellar. But were he tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in his proportions, <hi>his Variety</hi> might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted rather to Curiosity, than <hi>Luxury.</hi> But what the Temperate Man uses as a Cordial, He drinks by full Draughts, till enflamed by Excess, he is fitted to be an Instrument of Mischief, if not to others, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to himself; whom perhaps at last he knows not: For such <hi>Brutality</hi> are some come to, they will <hi>Sip</hi> themselves out of their own knowledge. This is the Lust of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> that is <hi>not of the Father,</hi> but of the <hi>World:</hi> For upon this comes in the <hi>Musick</hi> and the <hi>Dance,</hi> the <hi>Mirth</hi> and the <hi>Laughter,</hi> which is <hi>Madness,</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Eccl. 2. 2.</note> that the <hi>Noise</hi> of one <hi>Pleasure</hi> may <hi>drown</hi> the <hi>Iniquity</hi> of <hi>another,</hi> left, his own heart should deal too plainly with him. Thus the <hi>Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> live; <hi>They forget God, they regard not the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</hi> O that the Sons and Daughters of Men would consider their <hi>Wantonness</hi> and their Iniquity in these things! How ill do they requite the Goodness of God in the <hi>use</hi> and <hi>abuse</hi> of the <hi>Plenty</hi> he yields them; How Cruel are they to his Creatures, how Lavish of their Lives and Vertue, how Thankless for them; Forgetting the <hi>Giver</hi> and abusing the <hi>Gift</hi> by their Lusts; and <hi>despising Counsel, and casting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction behind them.</hi> They lose <hi>Tenderness,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get <hi>Duty,</hi> being swallowed up of <hi>Voluptuousness;</hi> adding one excess to another.

The Spirits being thus loaded with <hi>Ill Flesh,</hi> and the Mind effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, a man is made Unactive, and so Unuseful in Civil Society; for Idleness follows <hi>Luxury,</hi> as well as Diseases. These are the <hi>Burdens</hi> of the World, <hi>Devourers</hi> of good things, <hi>Self-Lovers,</hi> &amp; <hi>so Forgetters of God:</hi> But( which is sad and yet just) the end of those that forget God, is to be <hi>turned into Hell.</hi>

sure are the generality.<note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. 3. 21.</note> I say, if Sin, brought the <hi>first Coat,</hi> poor <hi>Adam's</hi> Off-spring have little reason to be proud or curious in their Clothes; for it seems their Original was Base, and the Finery of them will neither make them Noble, nor Man Innocent again. But doubtless blessed was that time, when Innocence, not Ignorance, freed our first Parents from such shifts: They were then naked, and knew no Shame; but <hi>Sin</hi> made them ashamed to be longer Naked. Since therefore Guilt brought <hi>Shame,</hi> and <hi>Shame</hi> an <hi>Apron</hi> and a <hi>Coat,</hi> how very low are they fallen that <hi>glory in their Shame, that are proud of their Fall?</hi> For so they are, that use Care and Cost to trim and set off the very <hi>Badge</hi> and <hi>Livery</hi> of that lamentable Lapse. It is all one, as for a man that had lost his Nose by a Scandalous Distemper, to take pains to set out a false one, in such shape and splendor, as should give but the greater occasion for all to gaze upon him, as if he would tell them, he had lost his Nose, for fear they should think he had not. But would a wise man be in love with a false Nose, tho' never so rich, and however finely made? Surely no: And shall People that call themselves Christians, shew so much love for <hi>Clothes,</hi> as to neglect <hi>Innocence,</hi> their <hi>first Clothing?</hi> Doth it not shew what cost of time, pains and Money People are at, to set off their Shame, with the greatest shew and solemnity of Folly? Is it not to delight in the effect of that Cause, which they <hi>rather should</hi> lament? If a <hi>Thief</hi> were to wear <hi>Chains</hi> all his Life, would their being Gold, and well made,
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:006041_0240_0F646F876EF5AEC8"/>
abate his Infamy? To be sure his being choice of them, would encrease it. Why, this is the very case of the vain <hi>Fashion-Mongers</hi> of this shameless Age; yet will they be <hi>Christians, Judges</hi> in <hi>Religion, Saints,</hi> what not? O miserable state indeed! To be so blinded by the <hi>Lust of the Eye, the Lust of the Flesh, and Pride of Life,</hi> as to call Shame <hi>Decency,</hi> and to be curious and expensive about that which should be their <hi>Humiliation.</hi> And not only are they grown in love with these Vanities, and thereby express how wide they are from Primitive Innocence; but its Notorious how many <hi>Fashions</hi> have been, and are invented on purpose to excite <hi>Lust:</hi> Which still puts them at a greater distance from a simple and harmless state, and enslaves their Minds to base Concupiscence.</p>
                  <p>§. V. Nor is it otherwise with <hi>Recreations,</hi> as they call them; for these are nearly related. Man was made a Noble, Rational, Grave Creature: His Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure stood in his <hi>Duty,</hi> and his Duty in <hi>Obeying God;</hi> which was to <hi>Love, Fear, Adore</hi> and <hi>Serve</hi> Him; and in using the Creation with true Temperance and godly Moderation; as knowing well that the Lord, his Judge, was at hand, the Inspector and Reward of his works. In short, his Happiness was in his Communion with God; his <hi>Error</hi> was to leave that Conversation, and let his Eyes wander abroad to gaze on Transitory things. If the <hi>Recreations</hi> of the Age were as pleasant and necessary, as they are said and made to be, <hi>Unhappy</hi> then would <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> have been, that never knew them. But had

they never fallen, and the World been tainted by their Folly and ill Example, perhaps Man had never known the necessity or use of many of these things. Sin gave them Birth, as it did the other; They were afraid of the Presence of the Lord, which was the joy of their Innocency, when they had sinned; and then their Minds wandered, sought other Pleasures, and began to forget God; as he complained after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Amos 6. 3. 4, 5, 6.</note> 
                     <q>They put far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Evil Day: They eat the fat of the Flock: They drink Wine in Bowls: They anoint themselves with the chief Persumes: They stretch themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Beds of Ivory: They chaunt to the found of the Viol, &amp; invent unto themselves Instruments of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, like <hi>David,</hi> not heeding or remembring the Afflictions and Captivity of poor <hi>Joseph;</hi>

                  <p>§. VI. But the <hi>Christian World</hi> (as it would be called) is justly reproveable, because the very end of the first Institution of <hi>Apparel</hi> is grosly perverted. The utmost Service that <hi>Cloaths</hi> originally were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for, when <hi>Sin</hi> had stript them of their native Innocence, was, as hath been said, to cover their shame, therefore <hi>Plain</hi> and <hi>Modest:</hi> Next, <hi>To fence out Cold,</hi> therefore Substantial: Lastly, To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare Sexes, therefore Distinguishing.

Flocks, do good, exercise their Bodies in such manner as was suitable to Gravity, Temperance and Vertue; but now that word is extended to almost every folly that carries any appearance above open Scandalous Filth (detested of the very Actors, when they have done it) so much are men degenerated from <hi>Adam</hi> in his Disobedience; So much more Confident and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial are they grown in all Impieties: Yea, their Minds, through Custom, are become so very insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the Inconveniency that attends the like Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, that what was once meer Necessity, a Badge of Shame; at best but a Remedy, is now the <hi>Delight, Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Recreation</hi> of the Age. How Ignoble is it! how Ignominious and Unworthy of a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creature; <hi>Man which is endued with Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, sit to contemplate Immortality, and made a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion (if not Superior) to Angels, that he should mind a little Dust; a few shameful Rags; Inventions of meer</hi> Pride <hi>and</hi> Luxury; <hi>Toys, so Apith and Fantas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick; Entertainments so Dull and Earthy, that a</hi> Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <hi>a</hi> Baby, <hi>a</hi> Hobby-Horse, <hi>a</hi> Top, <hi>are by no means so foolish in a Simple Child, nor unworthy of his That's, as are such Inventions of the care and pleasure of Men.

with false Christians, to be destructive of good <hi>Manners,</hi> in that it more easily stole away the Minds of People from Sobriety to <hi>Wantonness, Idleness Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminacy,</hi> and made them only Companions for the <hi>Beast</hi> that perishes: Witness those famous Men, <hi>Anaxagoras, Socrates, Plato, Aristides, Cato, Seneca, Epictetus, &amp;c.</hi> who placed true Honour and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in nothing below <hi>Vertue</hi> &amp; <hi>Immortality.</hi> Nay such are the remains of <hi>Innocence</hi> among some <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> in our times, that they do not only Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick in a simple posture, but if a Christian (though he must be an odd one) fling out a filthy <hi>word,</hi> its customary with them, by way of Moral, <hi>to bring him Water to purge his Mouth.</hi> How much do the like Vertues and reasonable Instances accuse People pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing <hi>Christianity,</hi> of gross Folly and Intemperance O! that Men and Women had the fear of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Eyes! and that they were so charitable to themselves as to remember Whence they came, What they are doing, and to what they must return: That so more Noble, more Vertuous, more Rational and Heavenly things might be the matters of their Pleasure and Entertainment! That they would be once perswaded to believe how inconsistent the <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Vanity</hi> and Conversation they are mostly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in, really are with the true Nobility of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Soul; and let that just Principle, which taught the <hi>Heathens,</hi> teach them, lest it be found more tolerable for <hi>Heathens</hi> than such <hi>Christians</hi> in the day of Account! For if their Shorter Notions,
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:006041_0245_0F646F8BE7844988"/>
and more imperfect Sense of things could yet disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so much Vanity; if their degree of <hi>Light</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it, and they, in obedience thereunto, disused it, doth it not behove <hi>Christians</hi> much more? Christ came not to <hi>extinguish,</hi> no, but to <hi>improve</hi> that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: And they who think, they need do less now than before, had need to act better than they think. I conclude, That the <hi>Fashions</hi> and <hi>Recreations</hi> now in repute are very abusive of the end of Man's Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that the Inconveniences that attend them, as <hi>Wantonness, Idleness, Prodigality, Pride, Lust, Respect of Persons</hi> (witness a <hi>Plune</hi> of <hi>Feathers,</hi> or a <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat</hi> in a Country Village, whatever be the man that wears them) with the like Fruits, are repugnant to the Duty, Reason and true Pleasure of Man, and, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely inconsistent with that <hi>Wisdom, Knowledge, Manhood, Temperance, Industry,</hi> which render Man truly Noble and Good.</p>
                  <p>§. IX. Again, these things which have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto condemned, have never been the Conversation or Practice of the Holy Men and Women of old times, whom the Scriptures recommend for <hi>holy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,</hi> worthy of Imitation. <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were <hi>plain Men,</hi> and Princes, as <hi>Grasiers</hi> are, over their Families and Flocks. They were not so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous of the Vanities so much lived in by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Generation, for <hi>in all things, they pleased God by Faith.</hi> The first <hi>forsook his Father's House, Kindred and Country;</hi> a true Type or Figure of that <hi>Self-denial</hi> all must know, that would have <hi>Abraham</hi>

As <hi>first,</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Time, that were worth a World on a dying Bed, is lost: Money, that might be employed for some general good, vainly expended: Pleasure is taken in meer shame; Lusts are gratified, the Minds of People alienated from Heavenly things, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised

about meer folly: Pride taken in Cloaths, first given to cover Nakedness, whereby the Creature is neglected, and the Noble Creation of God disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, and men become Acceptable by their <hi>Trims</hi> and the <hi>Alomodeness</hi> of their Dress and Apparel; from whence <hi>Respect</hi> to <hi>Persons</hi> doth so naturally arise, that for any to deny it, is to affirm the Sun shines not at Noon-day: Nothing be more notorious, than the <hi>Cringing, Scraping, Sirring</hi> and <hi>Madaming</hi> of Persons, according to the <hi>Gawdiness</hi> of their <hi>Attire,</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="bottom">James 2 to 9.</note> which is detestable to God, and so absolutely forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Scriptures, that to do it, is to break the whole Law, and consequently to incur the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof. <hi>Next,</hi> What great holes do the like practices make in mens Estates? How are their Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations neglected? Young Women deluded? The Marriage-bed invaded? Contentions and Family Animosities begotten? Partings of Man and Wife? Disinheriting of Children? Dismissing of Servants? On the other hand, Servants made Slaves, Children disregarded, Wives despised and shamefully abused, thro' the intemperance of their Husbands; which either puts them upon the same extravagance; or laying such cruel Injustice to heart, they pine away their days in grief and misery.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a <hi>Liberty that feeds the Flesh, and gratifies the lustful Eye and Palate of poor Mortality:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they think it a laudable Condition to be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the <hi>Beast</hi> that <hi>eats</hi> and <hi>drinks</hi> but what his Nature doth require, although the Number is very small of such. So very exorbitant are Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men grown in this present Age; for either they do believe their <hi>Actions</hi> are to be ruled by their own <hi>Will;</hi> or else at best, that not to be stained with the Vilest Wickedness, is matter of great Boasting: And indeed it is so, in a time when nothing is too wicked to be done. But certainly, it is a sign of Universal Impiety in a Land, when not to be guilty of Sins the very <hi>Heathens</hi> loath, is to be <hi>Vertuous,</hi> yes, and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> too, and that to no small degree of Reputation: A Dismal Symptom to a Country!

Why I will tell you, Their Great Grand-father was an Heathen, and that not of the best sort: His Name was <hi>Epicharmus.</hi> 'Tis true, he is called a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> or <hi>a Lover of Wisdom;</hi> but he was only so by Name, and no more one in reality than the <hi>Comedians</hi> of these times are true <hi>Christians.</hi> 'Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of him by <hi>Suidas</hi> a Greek Historian, that he was the first man who invented Comedies; and by the help of one <hi>Phormus,</hi> he made also fifty Fables. But would you know his <hi>Country,</hi> and the Reason of his Invention? His <hi>Country</hi> was <hi>Syracuse,</hi> the chief City in <hi>Sicily,</hi> famous for the Infamy of many Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants; to please and gratify the Lusts of some of whom, he set his Wits to work. And don't you think this an <hi>ill Original?</hi> And is it less in any one to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itate, or justify the same, since the more sober <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> have themselves condemned them; Nay, is it not abominable, when such as call themselves <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> do both imitate and justify the like Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Nor had the melancholly <hi>Tragedies</hi>

or <hi>representation</hi> of other Persons by change of Habit, Humors, &amp;c. all which are now so much in Use and Reputation with the great Ones of the Times. To these let me add that Poetical <hi>Amoroso,</hi> whom an inordinate Passion of Love first transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to those Poetical Raptures of Admiration (indeed fordid Effeminacy, if not Idolatry) they call him <hi>Alcman</hi> or <hi>Alcina,</hi> a <hi>Lydian:</hi> He being exceedingly in Love with a young Woman of his own Country, is said to have been the first Person that gave the World a sight of that kind of Folly, namely, <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories</hi> and <hi>Verses;</hi> which have been so diligently imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by almost all Nations ever since in their Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</p>

I know that some will say, <q>But we have so many Comedies and Tragedies Sonnets, Ketch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that are on Purpose to reprehend Vice, from whence we learn many commendable things.</q> Though this be shameful, yet many have been wont for Want of Shame or Understanding, or both, to return me this for Answer. Now I readily shall confess, that 'twas the next Remedy amongst the <hi>Heathens,</hi> against the Common Vices, to these more grave and moral Lectures of their <hi>Philosophers,</hi> of which Number I shall instance two: <hi>Euripides,</hi> whom <hi>Suidas</hi> calls a <hi>Learned Tragical</hi> Poet, and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> whom the same <hi>Historian</hi> calls a <hi>Comical Poet.</hi> The first was a Man so chaste, and therefore so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like those of our days, that he was called <hi>Misogones,</hi> or <hi>one that hated Women,</hi> that is wanton ones, for

otherwise he was <hi>twice Married:</hi> The other he cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters as most <hi>severe Reprehender of Faults.</hi> From which I gather, that their design was not to feed the <hi>Idle Lazy Fancies</hi> of People nor meerly to get <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:</hi> but since by the means of <hi>loose Wits,</hi> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had been <hi>debauched,</hi> their work was to reclaim them, rendring Vice Ridiculous, and turning Wit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Wickedness. And this appears the rather, from the description given, as also that <hi>Euripides</hi> was supposed to have been <hi>Torn in pieces</hi> by <hi>wanton Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> which doubtless was for declaiming against their Impudence: And the other being slain in the Battle betwixt the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> was so regreted, as a Law was made, as that never after such <hi>Poets</hi> should be allowed to bear Arms: Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it was because in losing him, they lost a <hi>Reprover</hi> of <hi>Vice.</hi> So that the end of the <hi>Approved</hi> Comoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and Tragoedians of those times, was but to <hi>Reform the People</hi> by making Sin odious: And that not so much by a rational and argumentative way, usual with their <hi>Philosophers,</hi> as by Sharp <hi>Jeers,</hi> severe <hi>Reflections,</hi> and rendring their <hi>vicious Actions Shameful Ridiculous &amp; Detestable;</hi> so that for Reputation sake they might not longer be guilty of them: Which to me is but a little foster than a <hi>Whip</hi> or a <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</hi> Now if you that <hi>Plead</hi> for them will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be accounted, <hi>Heathens,</hi> and those of the more <hi>dissolute</hi> and <hi>Wicked sort</hi> too, that will sooner be Jeer'd, than Argued out of your Sins, we shall acknowledge to you, that such <hi>Comedies</hi> and <hi>Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>

This is so far from <hi>Christianity,</hi> that many of the Nobler <hi>Heathens,</hi> Men and Women, were better taught and better disposed; They found out more heavenly Contemplations, and subjects of an Eternal Nature, to meditate upon.

of the greatest Contumely and Reproach. Nay, so impudent are some grown in their Impieties, that they sport themselves with such <hi>Religious Persons;</hi> and not only manifest a great Neglect of Piety and a severe Life by their own Looseness, but their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Contempt of it, by rendering it Ridiculous thro' Comical and Abusive Jests, on <hi>Publick Stages.</hi> Which, how dangerous it is, and apt to make Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <hi>little worth,</hi> in the People's Eyes, besides the demonstration of this Age, let us remember, that <hi>Aristophanes</hi> had not a readier way to bring the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Socrates</hi> in question with the People; who greatly reverenced him for his Grave and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Life and Doctrine, than by his <hi>Abusive Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations</hi> of him in a Play: Which made the airy, wanton unstable Crowd, rather part with <hi>Socrates</hi> in Earnest, than <hi>Socrates</hi> in Jest. Nor can a Reason better be given, why the poor <hi>Quakers</hi> are made so much the Scorn of Men, than because of their <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Reprehensions</hi> of Sin and Vanity, and their <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying</hi> Conversation, amidst so great Intemperance in all Worldly Satisfactions: Yet can such <hi>Libertines</hi> all this while strut and' swell for <hi>Christians,</hi> and strut it out against Precept and Example; but we must be <hi>Whimsical, Conceited, Morose, Melancholy,</hi> or else <hi>Hereticks, Deceivers</hi> and what not?

subsist, whose Livelihood depends upon such Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions and Recreations as you so earnestly decry?</q> 
                     <hi>I Answer;</hi> It is a bad Argument to plead for the <hi>Commission</hi> of the <hi>least Evil,</hi> that never so <hi>great</hi> a <hi>Good</hi> may come of it: If you and they have made <hi>Wickedness</hi> your Pleasure and your Profit, be ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that it should be your <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Punishment,</hi> till the one can learn to be without such Vanity, and the others have found out more Honest Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 'Tis the Vanity of the few great ones, that makes so much Toil for the Many <hi>Small;</hi> and the great Excess of the <hi>One,</hi> occasions the great Labour of the <hi>Other.</hi> Would men learn to be contented with <hi>Few Things,</hi> such as are necessary and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, the ancient Christian Life, all things might be at a <hi>cheaper Rate,</hi> and men might live for little. If the <hi>Landlords</hi> had less <hi>Lusts</hi> to satisfy, the <hi>Tenants</hi> might have less <hi>Rent</hi> to pay, and turn from Poor to Rich, whereby they might be able to find more-ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and domestick Employments for their Children, than becoming <hi>Sharpers,</hi> and living by their Wits, which is but a better word for their Sins. And if the report of the more Intelligent in <hi>Husbandry</hi> be credible, <hi>Lands</hi> are generally improveable <hi>Ten</hi> in <hi>Twenty:</hi> And were there more <hi>Hands</hi> about more lawful and serviceable <hi>Manufactures</hi> they would be cheaper, and greater Vent might be made of them, by which a Benefit would redound to the World in general: Nay the Burden lies the <hi>Heavier</hi> upon the <hi>Laborious Country,</hi> that so many Hands and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

(as have the <hi>Lust-Caterers</hi> of the Cities) should be wanting, to the Plow and useful Husbandry. If men never think themselves rich enough they may never miss of Trouble and Employment; but those who can take the <hi>Primitive State</hi> and God's Creation for their Model, may learn with a little to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; as knowing that desires after Wealth, do not only prevent or destroy true Faith, but when got encrease <hi>Snares</hi> and <hi>Trouble.</hi> It is no Evil to repent of Evil; but that can't be, whilst Men maintain what they should repent of: It is a bad Argument to avoid Temperance, or justify the contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause otherwise the Actors and Inventors of excess would want a Livelihood; since to feed them that Way, is to Nurse the Cause, instead of Starving it. Let such of those <hi>Vanity-Hucksters</hi> as have got suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, be contented to Retreat, and spend it more honestly than they have got it; and such as really are Poor, be rather helpt by <hi>Charity</hi> to better Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: This were more <hi>prudent, nay, Christian,</hi> than to consume Money upon such foolish Toys and Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries. Publick <hi>Work Houses</hi> would be effectual Remedies to all these Lazy and Lustful Distempers, with more Profit, and a better Conscience. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that we cannot, we dare not square our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation</hi> by the World's: No, but by our Plainness and Moderation to testify against such Extravagant Vanities; and by our <hi>Grave</hi> and <hi>Steady Life</hi> to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest our dislike, on God's behalf to such <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> and <hi>wanton Curiosity;</hi> Yea, to deny our selves,

                  </argument>
                  <p>§. I. BUt should these things be as <hi>Indifferent,</hi> as they are proved perniciously unlawful (for
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:006041_0298_0F646FB98D89A320"/>
I never heard any advance their <hi>Plea</hi> beyond the Bounds of meet <hi>Indifferency</hi>) yet so great is their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse,</hi> so universal the <hi>sad Effects</hi> thereof, like to an infection, that they therefore ought to be rejected of all, especially those whose <hi>Sobriety</hi> hath preserv'd them on this side of that Excess, or whose <hi>Judgments</hi> (though themselves be guilty) suggest the Folly of such <hi>Intemperance.</hi> For what is an <hi>Indifferent</hi> Thing, but that which may be done, or left undone? Granting, I say, this were the case, yet do both Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Religion teach, that when they are used with such an <hi>Excess</hi> of <hi>Appetite,</hi> as to leave them would be a cross to their Desires, they have exceeded the Bounds of meer <hi>Indifferency,</hi> and are thereby rendred no less than necessary. Which being a Violation of the very Nature of the things themselves, a perfect <hi>Abuse</hi> enters; and consequently they are no longer to be considered in the rank of things simply Indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but <hi>Unlawful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. II. Now that the whole <hi>Exchange</hi> of <hi>Things</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which I have so earnestly contended, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally abused by the <hi>Excess</hi> of almost all <hi>Ages, Sexes</hi> and <hi>Qualities</hi> of people, will be confessed by many who yet decline not to conform themselves to them; and to whom, as I have understood, it only seems Lawful, because (say they) <hi>The abuse of others, should be no Argument, why we should not use them.</hi> But to such I Answer, That they have quite forgot, or will not remember, they have acknowledged these things to be but of an <hi>Indifferent Nature:</hi> If so, (and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity)
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:006041_0299_0F646FBA0F1BC470"/>
never urg'd more) I say, there can be nothing more clear, then since they acknowledge their great abuse, that they are wholly <hi>to be</hi> forsaken: For since they may as well be let alone, as done at any time, surely they should then of Duty be let alone,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Phi. 3. 17.</note> when the <hi>use</hi> of them is an abetting the General Excess, and a meer exciting others to continue in their <hi>Abuse,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they find persons reputed sober to imitate them, or otherwise to give them an <hi>Example: Precepts are not half so forcible as Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. III. Every one that pretends to <hi>Seriousness,</hi> ought to inspect himself, as having been too forward to help on the <hi>Excess,</hi> and can never make too much haste out of those Inconveniences, that by his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Examples he encouraged any to<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 14. to the end.</note>; that by a new one he may put a seasonable Check upon the Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of others. A wise <hi>Parent</hi> ever withdraws those <hi>Objects,</hi> however Innocent in themselves, which are too prevalent upon the weak senses of his <hi>Children,</hi> on purpose that they might be <hi>weaned:</hi> And 'tis as frequent with men to bend a crooked Stick as much the contrary way, that they might make it straight at last. Those that have more <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety</hi> than others, should not forget their Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, and exercise that <hi>Gift of God</hi> to the security of their Neighbours. 'Twas <hi>Murdering Cain,</hi> that rudely asked the Lord, <hi>Was he his Brothers Keeper</hi>

                        </gap>, 5.</note>? For <hi>Every Man</hi> is necessarily obliged thereto; and therefore should be so <hi>wise,</hi> as to deny himself the
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:006041_0300_0F646FBAC4DC1848"/>
use of such Indifferent Enjoyments, as cannot be used by him, without too manifest an Encouragement to his Neighbours <hi>Folly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. IV. God hath sufficiently excited men to what is said; for in the case of the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> which was an heavenly Institution and Type of Christ, He with great displeasure enjoin'd it should be broke to pieces, because they were too fond and doting upon it. Yes the very Groves themselves, however plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant for Situation, beautiful for their Walks and Trees, must be cut down; and why? Only because they had been <hi>abused</hi> to <hi>Idolatrous Uses.</hi> And what's an Idol, but that which the Mind puts an over esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate or value upon? None can benefit themselves so much by an <hi>Indifferent</hi> thing, as others by not using that abused Liberty.</p>
                  <p>§. V. If those things were convenient in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which is a step nearer <hi>Necessity,</hi> than meer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, yet when by Circumstances they become <hi>prejudicial,</hi> such Conveniency it self ought to be put up; much more what's but <hi>Indifferent;</hi> should be deny'd. People ought not to weigh their private Satisfactions more than a <hi>publick Good;</hi> nor please themselves in too free a use of Indifferent things, at the cost of being so really prejudicial to the Publick, as they certainly are, whose use of them (if no worse) becomes <hi>Exemplary</hi> to others, and begets an Impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in their Minds to have the like<note n="†" place="bottom">Is. 10. 3, 4.</note>. Wherefore it is both reasonable and incumbent on all, to make only such things necessary, as tend to <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Godliness,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Pet. 1. 3. Eph. 5. 7.</note>
                     <pb n="277" facs="unknown:006041_0301_0F646FBB2D6DAF38"/>
and to employ their freedom with most advantage to their Neighbours. So that here is a <hi>twofold</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation; the <hi>One,</hi> not to be Exemplary in the use of such things; which, though they may use them, yet not without giving too much countenance to the abuse and excessive Vanity of their Neighbours<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 14. 1 to the end.</note>. The other obligation is, that they ought so far to condescend to such Religious People, who are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at these <hi>Fashions,</hi> and that kind of Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to reject them.</p>
                  <p>§. VI. Now those, who notwithstanding what I have urged, will yet proceed; what is it, but that they have so involv'd themselves and their <hi>Affections</hi> in them, that it is hardly possible to Reform them; and that for all their many <hi>Protestations</hi> against their fondness to such <hi>Fopperies,</hi> they really <hi>Love</hi> Them more than <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Cross.</hi> Such cannot seek the good of others, who do so little respect their own. For, after a serious consideration, What <hi>Vanity, Pride, Idleness, Expence of Time and Estates,</hi> have been, and yet are? How many Persons debauched from their first Sobriety, and Women from their natural Sweetness and Innocence, to Loose, Airy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>§. VII. That these things are the case and almost innumerable more, I am perswaded no ingenuous Person of any Experience will deny: How then, upon a serious reflection, any that pretend Conscience, or the fear of <hi>God Almighty,</hi> can longer continue in the Garb, Livery and Conversation of those, whose whole Life tends to little else, than what I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, much less join with them in their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Excess, I leave to the just Principle in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to judge<note n="*" place="bottom">Jer. 16. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</note>.

And for witness, hear what the <hi>Revelations</hi> say in her description<note n="‖" place="bottom">Rev. 18. 7, 8, 12, 13.</note>; <q>How much she hath glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified her self, and lived deliciously, so much Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

But at the Terrible Day, who will go to her Exchange any more? Who to her Plays? Who will follow her Fashions then? And who shall Traffick in her delicate Inventions? Not one; for she shall be judged. No Plea shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse or rescue her from the Wrath of the Judge; for <hi>

                  <p>§. VIII. But my Arguments against these things end not here; for the contrary most of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces to Good, namely, <q>Temperance in Food, Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Apparel; with a meek, shamefac'd and quiet Spirit, and that Conversation which doth only express the same in all Godly Honesty:</q> As the Apostle saith,<note n="†" place="bottom">Col. 4. 5, 6. 1 Thes. 4. 21. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>§. IX.

                  <p>Alas! why should Men need Perswasions, to what their own Felicity so necessarily leads them to? Had these <hi>Vitioso's</hi> of the Times but a sense of Heathen <hi>Cato's</hi> Generosity, they would rather deny their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Appetites, than leave such nobles Enterprizes unattempted. But that they should Eat, Drink, Play, Game and Sport away their Health, Estates, and above all, their Irrevocable precious Time, which should be dedicated to the Lord, as a necessary Introduction to a Blessed Eternity, and than which (did they but know it) no Worldly Solace could come in competition; I say, that they should be continually employ'd about these poor, low things, is to have the Heathens judge them in God's day, as well as Christian Precepts and Examples condemn them. And their <hi>final Doom</hi> will prove the more Astonishing, in that this Vanity and Excess are acted under a Profession of the Self-denying Religion of

                     <hi>No Cross, No Crown,</hi> should have ended here; but that the Power, Examples and Authorities have put upon the Minds of People, above the most reasonable and pressing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, inclin'd me to present my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with some of those many Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that might be given, in favour of the Vertuous Life recommended in our Discourse. I chuse to cast them into three Sorts of Testimonies (not after the <hi>Threefold Subject</hi> of the Book, but) sutable to the Times, Qualities, and Circumstances of the <hi>Persons</hi> that gave them forth; whose divers Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and Stations have transmitted their Names with Reputation to our

own Times. The first Testimony comes from those called <hi>Heathens,</hi> the second from <hi>Profess'd Christians,</hi> and the last from <hi>Retir'd, Aged,</hi> and <hi>Dying Men;</hi> being their <hi>last</hi> and <hi>serious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,</hi> to which no <hi>Ostentation</hi> or <hi>Worldly Interests</hi> could induce them. Where it will be easy for the <hi>Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Reader</hi> to observe how much the <hi>Pride, Avarice,</hi> and <hi>Luxury</hi> of the World, stood reprehended in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Persons of great Credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Men; and what was that Life and Conduct, that in their most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired Meditations, when their Sight was clearest, and Judgment most free and disabused, they thought would give Peace Here, and lay Foundations of <hi>Eternal Blessedness.</hi>

                  <head>I. The Testimonies of Several Great, Learned, and Vertuous Personages among the Gentiles, urged against the Excesses of the Age, in favour of the Self-denial, Temperance and Piety herein recommended.</head>

                     <p>§. II. <hi>Cyrus</hi> (than whom a greater Monarch we hardly find in Story) is more famous for his Vertue, than his Power; and indeed it was <hi>that</hi> which gave him Power. God calls him his Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard: Now let us see the Principles of his Conduct and Life: So Temperate was he in his Youth, that when <hi>Astyages</hi> urged him to drink Wine, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <q>I am afraid left there should be poison in 'it; having seen Thee reel and sottish after having drunk thereof.</q> And so careful was he to keep the <hi>Persians</hi> from Corruption of Manners, that he would not suffer them to leave their Rude and Mountanous Country for one more Pleasant and Fruitful, left, through Plenty and Ease, Luxury at last might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base their Spirits. And so very Chaste was he, that having taken a Lady of Quality, a most Beautiful Woman, his Prisoner, he refused to see her, saying, 'I have no mind to be a Captive to my Captive.' It seems, he claimed no such Propriety; but shun'd the occasion of Evil. The Comptroller of his Houshold asking him one day, what he would

please to have for his Dinner?' Bread, saith he; for 'I intend to Encamp nigh the Water:' A short and easie Bill of Fare: But this shews the power he had over his Appetite, as well as his Soldiers; and that he was fit to Command others, that could Command himself. According to another saying of his, <q>No man (saith he) is worthy to Command, who is not better than those who are to Obey:</q> And when he came to dye, he gave this Reason of his Belief of Immortality, <q>I cannot, saith he, perswade my self to think, that the Soul of man, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sustained it self in a mortal Body, should perish, when delivered of it, for want of it;</q> A saying of perhaps as great weight, as may be advanced against <hi>Atheism</hi> from more enlightned Times.</p>
                     <p>§. III. <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon,</hi> being upon an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary occasion reduced to Eat Barly Bread and dryed Figgs, and drink Water; <q>What Pleasure (saith he) have I lost till now, through my Delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Excess!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. IV. <hi>Agathocles</hi> becoming King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> from being the Son <hi>of a Potter,</hi> always to humble his Mind to his <hi>Original,</hi> would be daily served in some Earthen Vessels upon his Table: an Example of Humility and Plainness.</p>
                     <p>§. V. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> upon three sorts of good News arrived in one day, feared too much success might transport him immoderately; and therefore pray'd for some Disappointments to season his Prosperity, and caution his Mind under the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment

of it. He refused to oppress the <hi>Greeks</hi> with his Garrisons, saying, <q>I had rather retain them by kindness, than fear; and to be always Beloved, than for a while Terrible.</q> One of his Minions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading him, To decline hearing of a Cause, wherein a particular Friend was Interested; <q>I had much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, says he, thy Friend shall lose his Cause, than I my Reputation.</q> Seeing his Son <hi>Alexander</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to gain the Hearts of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> by Gifts and Rewards, <q>Canst thou believe, says he, that a man that thou hast corrupted to thy Interests, will ever be true to them?</q> When his Court would have had him quarrel'd and corrected the <hi>Peloponnen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> for their Ingratitude to him, he said, <q>By no means, for if they despise and abuse me after being kind to them, what will they do if I do them harm?</q> A great Example of Patience in a King, and wittily said. Like to this was his Reply to the Embassadors of <hi>Athens</hi> whom asking after Audience, If he could do them any Service, and one of them sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily answering, <q>The best thou canst do us is, to hand thy self;</q> He was nothing disturbed, though his Court murmured; but calmly said to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, <q>Those who suffer Injuries, are better Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple than those that do them.</q> To conclude with him, being one day fallen along the ground, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself in that Posture, cried out, <q>What a small Spot of Earth do we take up, and yet the whole 'World cannot content us!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. VI. <hi>Alexander,</hi> was very temperate and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006041_0320_0F646FCAEF248310"/>
in his Youth: A certain Governour having written to him that a Merchant of the place had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral fine Boys to sell, He returned him this Answer with great Indignation, <q>What hast thou seen, in any Act of my Life, that should put thee upon such a Message as this?</q> And avoided the Woman, his Courtiers flung in his way, to debauch him. Nay, he would not see the Wife of <hi>Darius,</hi> famed for the most Beautiful Princess of the Age; which with his other Vertues, made <hi>Darius</hi> (the last <hi>Persian</hi> King) to say, <q>If God has determined to take my Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire from me, I wish it into the Hands of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> my vertuous Enemy.</q> He hated Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; for though he left great Conquests, he left no Riches; which made him thus to answer one that askt him dying, <q>Where he had hid his Treasures, Among my Friends, says he. He was wont to say, He owed more to his Master for his Education, than to his Father for his Birth; by how much it was less to <hi>live,</hi> than to <hi>live Well.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>§. VIII. <hi>Exenuphanes,</hi> being jeer'd for refusing to play at a forbidden Game, answered; <q>I do not fear my Money, but my Reputation: They that make Laws, must keep them.</q> A commendable saying.</p>
                     <p>§. IX. <hi>Antigonus,</hi> being taken sick, he said, <q>It was a Warning from God to instruct him of his
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006041_0321_0F646FCBF8604FE0"/>
Mortality.</q> 
                        <hi>A Poet</hi> flattering him with the Title of <hi>the Son of God;</hi> He answered, <q>My Servant knows contrary.</q> Another <hi>Sycophant</hi> telling him, that the Will of Kings is the Rule of Justice: <q>No saith he, Rather Justice is the Rule of the Will of Kings</q>. And being prest by his Minions to put a Garrison into <hi>Athens,</hi> to hold the <hi>Greeks</hi> in subjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, He answered, <q>He had not a stronger Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, than the Affections of his People.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. X. <hi>Themistocles</hi> after all the Honour of his Life, sits down with this Conclusion, <q>That the Way to the Grave is more desirable than the Way to Worldly Honours.</q> His Daughter being court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one of little Wit and great Wealth, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of little Wealth and great Goodness; he chose the poor man for his Son in Law; For, saith he, <q>I will rather have a Man without Money, than Money without a Man; reckoning, that not Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but Worth, makes the Man.</q> Being told by <hi>Symmachus,</hi> that he would teach him the Art of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; he gravely answered, <q>He had rather learn the Art of Forgetfulness;</q> adding, <q>He could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member enough, but many things he could not forget, which were necessary to be forgotten;</q> as the Honours, Glories Pleasures and Conquests he had spent his Days in, too apt to transport to vain Glory.</p>
                     <p>§. XI. <hi>Aristides,</hi> a wife and just <hi>Greek,</hi> of greatest Honour and Trust with the <hi>Athenians;</hi> He was a great Enemy to Cabals in Government: The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he renders is, <q>Because, saith he, I would not be
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006041_0322_0F646FCD896E3AF8"/>
obliged to authorize Injustice:</q> He so much hated Covetousness, though he was Thrice chosen Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer of <hi>Athens,</hi> that he lived and died Poor, and that of Choice: For being therefore reproached by a rich Usurer, he answered, <q>Thy Riches hurt thee, more than my Poverty hurts me.</q> Being once banished by a contrary Faction in the State, he pray'd to God, <q>that the Affairs of his Country might go so well, as never to need his Return;</q> which however caused him presently to be recalled. Whereupon he told them; <q>That he was not troubled for his Exile with respect to himself, but the Honour of his Country.</q> 
                        <hi>Themistocles,</hi> their General, had a Project to propose to render <hi>Athens,</hi> Mistress of <hi>Greece,</hi> but it required Secrecy: The People obliged him to communicate it to <hi>Aristides,</hi> whose Judgment they would follow. <hi>Aristides</hi> having privately heard it from <hi>Themistocles,</hi> publickly answered to the People, <q>True, there was nothing more Advantagious, nor nothing more Unjust:</q> which quasht the Project.</p>
                     <p>§. XII.<hi>Pericles,</hi> as he mounted the Tribunal, prayed to God, <q>that not a word might fall from him, that might scandalize the People, wrong the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs, or hurt his own.</q> One of his Friends praying him to Speak falsly in his favour: <q>We are Friends, saith he, but not beyond the Altar;</q> meaning not against Religion and Truth. <hi>Sophocles</hi> being his Companian, upon sight of a Beautiful Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, said to <hi>Pericles,</hi> 
                        <q>Ah, what a lovely Creature is that!</q> To whom <hi>Pericles</hi> reply'd, <q>It becometh a

Magistrate not only to have his Hands clean, but his Tongue and Eyes also.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. XIII. <hi>Phocion,</hi> a famous <hi>Athenian,</hi> was honest and poor, yea, he <hi>contemned Riches;</hi> For a certain Governour making Rich presents, he returned them; saying, <hi>I refused Alexanders.</hi> And when several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him to accept of such Bounty, or else his Children would want, he answered, <q>If my Son be Vertuous, I shall leave him enough, and if he be Vicious, more would be too little.</q> He rebuked the Excess of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and that openly, saying, <q>He that eateth more than he ought, maketh more Diseases than he can cure.</q> To Condemn or Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, was to him alike. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> telling him, when ever the People were enraged, they would Kill him; he answered, <q>And thou also, when they are come to their Wits.</q> He said, <q>An Orator was like a <hi>Cyprus</hi> Tree, fair and great, but Fruitless.</q>

To conclude, he was a Man of great <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> as well as Wisdom and Courage; for he was never observed to <hi>Lye in Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest or in Jest.</hi> And notwithstanding the ill and cross Humours of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> aggravated by his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Hazards and Services for their freedom and Renown, it is reported of him, <hi>That he ever bore them patiently,</hi> often saying, <q>That he ought no more to be revenged of his Country than of his Father.</q> And being wounded to Death in the Battle of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> he advised his Countrymen <hi>to make Peace, none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fit to command;</hi> which proved true.

That there was nothing more uneasie to Good men, than not to have the Liberty of speaking freely: And that if one knew what one had to suffer from the People, one would never meddle to govern them.

They taught their Children to Write and Read, to Obey the Magistrates, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure Labour, and to be bold in Danger: The Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of other Sciences were not so much as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in <hi>Lacedaemonia.</hi>—They had but one Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that new but once a Year.—They rarely
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006041_0334_0F646FD6EE0E7B48"/>
used Baths or Oyle, the Custom of those parts of the World—Their Youth lay in Troops upon Mats; the Boys and Girls apart.—They accustomed their Youth to Travel by Night without Light, to use them not to be afraid.—The Old Governed the Young; and those of them who obeyed not the Aged, were punisht.—It was a shame not to bear Reproof among the Youth; and among the Aged matter of Punishment not to give it. They made ordinary Cheer on purpose to keep out Luxury; holding, that mean fare kept the Spirit free, and the Body fit for Action. The Musick they used was simple, without Art of changings. Their Songs composed of vertuous Deeds of Good Men, and their Harmony mixt with some Religious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies, that seem'd to carry their minds above the fear of Death. They permitted not their Youth to Travel, left they should corrupt their Manners; And for the same Reason, they permitted not strangers to dwell amongst them, that conform'd not to their way of Living. In this they were so strict, that such of their Youth that were not edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in their Customs, enjoy'd not the Priviledges of Natives. They would suffer neither Comedies nor Tragedies to be acted in their Country. They condemned a Soldier but for painting his Buckler of Several Colours: And publickly punisht a Young man for having learnt but the Way to a Town given to Luxury. They also banisht an Orator for bragging that he could speak a whole Day upon
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006041_0335_0F646FD7A85C13B8"/>
Subject; for they did not like much speaking, much less for a bad Cause.—They buried their Dead without any Ceremony or Superstition; for they only used a Red Cloth upon the Body, Broi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with Olive Leaves: This Burial had all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Mourning they forbad, and Epitaphs too.—When they prayed to God, they stretcht forth their Arms, which with them was a sign that they must do good Works, as well as make good Prayers. They ask'd of God but two things, Patience in Labour, and Happiness in Well doing.</q> This Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is mostly the same with <hi>Xenophans;</hi> Adding, <q>That they eat moderately, and in common; the Youth mixed with the Aged, to awe them, and give them good Example.—That in walking, they would neither speak, nor turn their Eyes aside, any more than if they were Statues of Marble. The Men were bred Bashful, as well as the Women; not speaking at Meals, unless they were ask'd a Ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When they were Fifteen Years of Age, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of leaving them to their own Conduct, as in other places, they had most care of their Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they might preserve them from the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, that Age is incident to.—And those that would not comply with these Rules, were not count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed always honest People. And in this, their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was Excellent; that they thought, there was no greater Punishment for a Man; than to be known and used as such, at all times, in all places: For they were not to come into the Company of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006041_0336_0F646FD97969A990"/>
Persons of Reputation—They were to give place to all others; to stand when they sate: To be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to every Honest Man that met them, of their Conversation—That they must keep their poor Kindred.—That they used not the same Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, that Honest People might use: By which means, they kept Vertue in Credit, and Vice in Contempt. They used all things necessary for Life, without Superfluity, or Want; despising Riches, and Sumptuous Apparel and Living: Judging, that the best Ornament of the Body, is Health; and of the Mind, Vertue. And since (saith <hi>Xenophon</hi>) it is Vertue and Temperance, that renders us Commendable, and that it is only the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> that Reverence it publickly, and have made it the Foundation of their State; Their Government, of right, merits Preferrence to any other in the World.—But that, saith he, which is strange, is, that all Admire it, but none Imitate it.</q> Nor is this Account and Judgment Fantastical.</p>

Let us hear what he did: <hi>Lycurgus</hi> willing to retire his Citizens from a <hi>Luxurious,</hi> to a <hi>Vertuous Life,</hi> and shew them how much good Conduct, &amp; honest Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, might meliorate the State of Mankind; appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself to introduce a new Model of Government, perswading them to believe, That <q>though they were descended of Noble and Vertuous Ancestors,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006041_0337_0F646FDA46CDF180"/>
if they were not exercised in a course of Vertue, they would, like the Dog in the Kitchin, rather leap at the Meat than run at the Game.</q> In fine, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to <hi>Obey</hi> him. The first thing then that he did, to try his Power with them, was, To divide the Land into Equal Portions; so that the whole <hi>Laconick</hi> Country, seem'd but the Lots of <hi>Brethren;</hi> This grieved the Rich; but the Poor, which were the most, rejoiced—He render'd Wealth useless by <hi>Community;</hi> and forbid the use of Gold <hi>and</hi> Silver. He made <hi>Money</hi> or <hi>Iron,</hi> too base and heavy to make a <hi>Thief.</hi> He retrench'd their Laws of Building, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering no more Ornament than could be made with a <hi>Hatchet</hi> and a <hi>Saw;</hi> And their Furniture was like their Houses. This Course disbanded many Trades; No MERCHANT, no COOK, no LAWYER, no FLATTERER, no DIVINE, no ASTRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOGER, was to be found in <hi>Lacedaemonia. Injus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi> was banish'd their Society, having cut up the Root of it, which is <hi>Avarice,</hi> by introducing a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,</hi> and making Gold <hi>and</hi> Silver <hi>useless.</hi> To prevent the Luxury of <hi>Tables,</hi> as well as of <hi>Apparel</hi> he ordained Publick Places of Eating, where all should Publickly be served; those that <hi>refused</hi> to come thither, were reputed <hi>Voluptuous;</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, if not Corrected. He would have <hi>Virgins</hi> Labour, as well as <hi>Young Men;</hi> that their Bodies, being used to Exercise, might be the <hi>Stronger</hi> and <hi>healthier,</hi> when married, to bring forth Children. He <q>forbad that they should have any Portions, to the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006041_0338_0F646FDB420C0C40"/>
end, that none might make suit to them for their Wealth, but Person and Worth:</q> By which means, the <hi>Poor</hi> went off as well as the <hi>Rich;</hi> and that their <hi>Vertue</hi> might prefer them, <hi>they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to Use any Ornaments.</hi> He would not let the <hi>Young People</hi> Marry, till they arrived at the <hi>Flower of their Age;</hi> to the end, that their <hi>Children</hi> might be strong and <hi>vigorous. Chastity</hi> was so General, and so much in Request, that <hi>no Law, was made against Adultery;</hi> believing, that <hi>where Luxury, and the Arts leading to it, were so severely forbid, it was needless.</hi> He forbad, <hi>Costly Offerings</hi> in the Temple, <hi>that they might offer often; for that God regarded the Heart, not the Offering</hi>—These, and some more were the <hi>Laws</hi> he instituted; and whilst the <hi>Spartans</hi> kept them, 'tis certain, they were the <hi>first State of Greece,</hi> which lasted about <hi>Five Hundred Years.</hi> It is remarkable; that he would never suffer the <hi>Laws to be written,</hi> to avoid <hi>Barratry;</hi> and that the <hi>Judges</hi> might not be <hi>tied Religiously to the Letter of Law,</hi> but <hi>lest to the Circumstances of Fact;</hi> in which no Inconvenience was observed to follow.</p>

the Pride of it: <q>I had rather, said he, they should ask, why they set not up a Statue to <hi>Cato,</hi> than why they do</q>—He was a Man of Severity of Life, both <hi>Example</hi> and <hi>Judge</hi>—His <hi>Competitors</hi> in <hi>the Government,</hi> hoping to be preferred, took the contrary Humour, and mightily <hi>flattered</hi> the <hi>People;</hi> This <hi>good Man</hi> despised their <hi>Arts,</hi> and with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual Fervency, cry'd out, <q>That the Distempers of the Common wealth did not require Flatterers to deceive them, but Physicians to cure them;</q> which struck so great an awe upon the people, that he was first chosen of them all.—The fine <hi>Dames</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> became <hi>Governours</hi> to their Husbands; he lamented the Change, saying, <q>It is strange, that those who command the World, should yet be subject to Woman.</q>—He thought those Judges that <q>would not impartially punish Malefactors, greater Criminals than the Malefactors themselves:</q> A good Lesson for Judges of the World. He would say, <q>That it was better to lose a Gift than a Correction; for, says he, the one Corrupts us, but the other Instructs us.—That we ought not to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Honour from Vertue; for then there would be few any more Vertuous.</q> He would say, <q>No Man is fit to command another, that cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand himself. Great Men should be temperate in their Power, that they may keep it. For Men to be too long in Offices in a Government, is to have too little regard to others; or the Dignity of the State. They that do nothing, will learn to

by a circumspect conformity to vertuous Principles, he was fit to Rule those of other Men. Take some of his excellent Sayings, as followeth: <q>Of my Grand father <hi>Verus</hi> I have learned to be <hi>Gentle</hi> and <hi>Meek,</hi> and to refrain from all <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Passion.</hi> From the Fame and Memory of him that begot me, <hi>Shame facedness</hi> and <hi>Manlike Behaviour.</hi> I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served his <hi>Meekness,</hi> his <hi>Constancy,</hi> without waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in those things, which after a due Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Deliberation he had determined. How free from all <hi>Vanity</hi> he carried himself in matter of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Dignity!</hi> His <hi>Laboriousness</hi> and <hi>Assidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity;</hi> His readiness to hear any Man that had ought to say, tending to any <hi>Common Good;</hi> How he did abstain from all unchaste Love of Youth. His moderate cond. scending to other Mens occasions as an ordinary Man—Of my <hi>Mother,</hi> to be <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and <hi>Bountiful,</hi> and to forbear, not only to do, but to <hi>intend any Evil.</hi> To content my self with a spare <hi>Diet,</hi> and to fly all such Excess as is incident to great Wealth—Of my <hi>great Grand father,</hi> both to frequent publick Schools and Auditories, and to get me good and able Teachers at home; and that I ought not to think much, if upon such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions I were at excessive Charge. I gave over the study of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> and <hi>Poetry,</hi> and of elegant neat <hi>Language.</hi> I did not use to walk about the House in my <hi>Senator's Robe,</hi> nor to do any such things.

to be <hi>reconciled</hi> and well-pleased again with them that had offended me, as soon as any of them would be content to seek unto me again. To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve carefully the several Dispositions of my Friends, and not to be offended with <hi>Idiots,</hi> nor unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to set upon those that are carried away with the vulgar Opinions, with the <hi>Theorems and Tenets of Philosophers.</hi> To love the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> and to be <hi>Kind</hi> and <hi>Loving</hi> to all them of my House and Family, I learned from my Brother <hi>Severus:</hi> And it was he that put me in the first conceit and desire of an <hi>equal Common Wealth,</hi> administred by <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Equality;</hi> and of a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> wherein should be regarded nothing more than the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Welfare</hi> (or <hi>Liberty</hi>) of the <hi>Subjects.</hi> As for <hi>God,</hi> and such <hi>Suggestions, Helps</hi> and <hi>Inspirations,</hi> as might be expected, nothing did hinder, but that I might have begun long before to live according to Nature. Or that even now, that I was not yet Partaker, and in Present Possession of that Life, that I my self (in that I did not observe those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Motions and Suggestions; yea, and almost plain and apparent Instructions and Admonitions of of God) was the only cause of it.—I that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Nature of that which is <hi>Good,</hi> that it is to be desired; and of that which is <hi>Bad,</hi> that it is odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and shameful: Who know moreover, that this Transgressor, whosoever he be, is my Kinsman, not by the same Blood and Seed, but by Participation of the same <hi>Reason,</hi> and of the same <hi>divine Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,

or Principle;</hi> How can I either be hurt by any of these, since it is not in their Power, to make me incur any thing that is reproachful, or be angry and ill-affected towards him, who, by Nature, is so near unto me? For we are all born to be fellow-Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, as the Feet, the Hands, and the Eyelids; as the rowes of upper and under Teeth: For such therefore to be in Opposition, is against Nature.</q>—He saith, <q>It is high time for thee to understand the true Nature, both of the World, whereof thou art a Part, and of that Lord and Governour of the World, from whom, as a <hi>Channel</hi> from the Spring.</q> Thou thy self didst slow. <q>And that there is but a certain limit of time appointed unto thee, which if thou shalt not make use of, to <hi>calm</hi> and allay the many Distempers of thy Soul, it will pass away, and thou with it, and never after return.—Do, <hi>Soul,</hi> do, abuse, and contemn thy self, yet a while, and the time for thee to Repent thy self, will be at <hi>an End.</hi> Every Man's Happiness depends from himself; but behold, thy Life is almost at an End, whilst, not regarding thy self as thou oughtest, thou dost make thy Happiness to consist in the Souls and Conceits of other Men. Thou must also take heed of another kind of wandering; for they are Idle in their Actions, who <hi>toil</hi> and labour in their Life, and have no certain <hi>Scope,</hi> to which to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> all their Motions and Desires. As for <hi>Life and Death, Honour and Dishonour, Labour and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, Riches and Poverty,</hi> all these things happen

unto Men indeed, both <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad</hi> equally, but as things, which of themselves are neither good nor bad, because of themselves neither shameful nor praise-worthy. Consider the Nature of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly visible Things; of those especially, which either ensnare by <hi>Pleasure,</hi> or for their <hi>Irksomness</hi> are <hi>Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;</hi> or for their outward <hi>Lustre</hi> and <hi>Shew,</hi> are in great <hi>esteem</hi> and <hi>request;</hi> how <hi>Vile</hi> and <hi>Contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> how <hi>Base</hi> and <hi>Corruptible,</hi> how <hi>destitute</hi> of all true <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> they are. There is nothing more <hi>Wretched</hi> than that <hi>Soul,</hi> which, in a kind of Circuit, compasseth all Things; searching even the very Depths of all the Earth, and, by all Signs and Conjectures, prying into the very Thoughts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men's <hi>Souls;</hi> and yet of this is not sensible, that it is sufficient for a Man to apply himself whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to confine all his Thoughts and Cares to the Guidance of that <hi>Spirit which is within him,</hi> and truly and really serve him. For even the least Things ought not to be done without relation unto the End: And the end of the reasonable Creature is, <hi>To Follow and Obey him who is the Reason,</hi> as it were, and the <hi>Law</hi> of this <hi>great City,</hi> and most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Common-Wealth.

                     <p>§. LII. <hi>Chilon,</hi> another of the Wise Men of <hi>Greece,</hi> would say, <q>That it was the Perfection of a Man, to <hi>foresee</hi> and <hi>prevent</hi> Mischiefs.

Shun <hi>busie Bodies.</hi> Prefer Loss before covetous Gain. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise not the Miserable. If Powerful, behave thy self Mildly, that thou may'st be loved, rather than feared. Order thy House well: Bridle thy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: Grasp not at much: Make not haste; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dote upon any Thing below. A Prince (<hi>saith he</hi>) must not take up his time about Transitory and Mortal Things; Eternal and Immortal are fittest for him.</q> To conclude, he was so just in all his Actions, that <hi>Laertius</hi> tells us, <q>He professed in his Old Age, That he had never done any Thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Conscience of an Upright Man; only, that of one Thing he was doubtful, having given Sentence, against his Friend, according to Law, he advised his Friend, to appeal from him (<hi>his Judge</hi>) so to preserve both his Friend and the Law.</q> Thus True and Tender was Conscience in Heathen <hi>Chilon.</hi>

therefore to come to us, and know, thou art not to Instruct me only, but all the <hi>Macedonians;</hi> for he who Teacheth the King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and Guideth him to Vertue, it is evident, that he doth likewise Instruct all his Subjects in Vertue: For such as is the Prince, such for the most part are those who live under his Government.</q>

I Shall begin with the Blessed Author of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion<note n="†" place="bottom">The Doctrine &amp; Practice of the blessed Lord Jesus &amp; his Apostles, the Primitive Christians, and those of more Modern Tunes, in favour of this Discourse.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 1. <hi>JESUS CHRIST,</hi> in whose Mouth there was found <hi>No Guile</hi> (sent from God, with a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Love to Mankind, and laid down his <hi>Life</hi> for their <hi>Salvation;</hi> whom God hath raised by his mighty Power to be Lord of all) is of right to be first heard in this Matter; for <hi>never Man Spake like him,</hi> to our Point; Short, clear and close; and all opposite to the Way of this wicked World. <hi>Blessed</hi> (says he) <hi>are the Poor in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of God:</hi> He doth not say, Blessed are the Proud, the Rich, the High-minded: Here is <hi>Humility</hi> and the <hi>Fear</hi> of the Lord Blest. <hi>Blessed are they that Mourn, for they shall be Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> He doth not say, Blessed are the Feasters, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Revellers of the World, whose Life is Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of Pleasure and Jollity: No, as he was a <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>Sorrows,</hi> so he blest the Godly Sorrowful. <hi>Blessed are the</hi> Meek, <hi>for they shall inherit the Earth:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="unknown:006041_0406_0F64701537B66F98"/>
He doth not say, Blessed are the Ambitious, the Angry, and those that are Puffed up: He makes not the Earth a <hi>Blessing</hi> to them: And tho' they get it by <hi>Conquest</hi> and <hi>Rapine,</hi> it will at last fall into the Hands of the <hi>Meek,</hi> to Inherit. Again, <hi>Blessed are they which do Hunger and Thirst after Righteousness:</hi> But no Blessing to the Hunger and Thirst of the <hi>Luxurious</hi> Man. <hi>Blessed are the Merciful, for they shall obtain Mercy:</hi> He draws Men to <hi>Tenderness</hi> and <hi>Forgiveness,</hi> by Reward. Hast thou one in thy Power that hath wronged Thee? Be not Rigorous, <hi>Exact not the utmost Farthing;</hi> be Merciful and Pity the Afflicted, for such are <hi>Blessed.</hi> Yet further, <hi>Blessed are the Poor in Heart, for they shall see God:</hi> He doth not say, Blessed are the Proud, the Covetous, the Unclean, the Voluptuous, the Malicious: No, such shall never see God. Again, <hi>Blessed are the Peace Makers, for they shall be called the Children of God:</hi> He doth not say, Blessed are the Contentious <hi>Back-biters, Tale bearers, Brawlers, Fighters, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of War;</hi> neither shall they be called the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God,</hi> whatever they may call themselves. Lastly, <hi>Blessed are you when Men shall Revile you, and Persecute you, and say all manner of</hi> Evil <hi>against you falsly,</hi> for my sake; <hi>Rejoice</hi> and <hi>be exceeding Glad, for great is your Reward in Heaven:</hi> He blesseth the Troubles of his People, and translates Earthly Sufferings into <hi>Heavenly Rewards.</hi> He doth not say, Blessed are you when the <hi>World Speaks well of you,</hi> and <hi>fawns</hi> upon you: So that His Blessings cross
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:006041_0407_0F647015F6BF03C0"/>
the World's; for the World blesseth those as Happy, that have the World's <hi>Favour:</hi> He blessed those as happy that have the World's Frowns. This solveth the great Objection, "Why are you so foolish to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose your Selves to the Law, to incur the <hi>Displeasure</hi> of <hi>Magistrates,</hi> and suffer the <hi>Loss</hi> of your <hi>Estates</hi> and <hi>Liberties?</hi> Cannot a Man serve God in his Heart, and do as others do? Are you wiser than your Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Fathers? Call to mind your <hi>Ancestors.</hi> Will you question their Salvation by your Novelties, and forget the future Good of your <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> as well as sacrifice the present Comforts of your <hi>Life,</hi> to hold up the Credit of a Party?" A Language I have more than once heard: I say this Doctrine of Christ is an Answer and Antidote against the Power of this Objection. He teacheth us, to embrace Truth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all those Scandals. The <hi>Jews</hi> had more to say of this kind than any, whose way, had a more Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Institution; but Christ minds not either insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution or Succession. He was a New Man, and came to Consecrate a New Way, and that in the Will of God, and the Power that accompanied his Ministry and that of his Followers, abundantly proved the divine Authority of his Mission, who thereby warns his to expect and to bear Contradiction, Reviling and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution: For if they did it to the green Tree, much more were they to expect that they would do it to the dry: If to the Lord, then to the Servant. Why then should Christians fear that Reproach and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, that are the Companions of his Religion,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:006041_0408_0F647016CCCA2798"/>
since they work to his Sincere Followers a far more Exceeding and Eternal Weight of Glory? But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they have great Cause to Fear and be Ashamed, who are the <hi>Authors</hi> of such Reproach and Suffering, so contrary to the Meek and Merciful Spirit of Christ: For if they are Blessed, who are Reviled and Persecuted for his sake; the Revilers and Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors must be Cursed. But this is not all: He bid his Disciples <hi>Follow him, Learn of him,</hi> for he was <hi>Meek and Lowly:</hi> He taught them to <hi>Bear Injuries,</hi> and not <hi>Smite again;</hi> To exceed in <hi>Kindness;</hi> To <hi>go two Miles, when ask'd to go one;</hi> To Part with <hi>Cloak and Coat</hi> too; To give <hi>to them that ask,</hi> and and to <hi>Lend to them that borrow;</hi> To Forgive, ay, and Love <hi>Enemies</hi> too; commanding them, saying, <hi>Bless them that Curse you; Do Good to them that Hate you;</hi> and <hi>Pray for them which Despightfully use you, and Persecute you:</hi> Urging them with a most sensible Demonstration, <hi>That,</hi> saith he, <hi>you may be the Children of your Father, which is in Heaven: For he maketh the Sun to rise upon the</hi> Good <hi>and the</hi> Evil, <hi>and his Rain to descend upon the</hi> Just <hi>and the</hi> Unjust. He also taught his Disciples, to believe and rely upon <hi>God's Providence,</hi> from the Care that he had over the least of his Creatures: <q>Therefore, saith he, I say unto you, Take no thought for your Life, what you shall Eat, and what you shall Drink, nor yet for your Body, what you shall put on: Is not the Life more than Meat, and the Body than Rayment? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Fowls of the Air; for they Sow not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:006041_0409_0F647017719E1A48"/>
do they Reap, nor gather into Barns; yet your Heavenly Father feedeth them: Are you not much better than they? Which of you by taking tho't can add one Cubit unto his Stature? And why take you thought for Rayment? Consider the Lillies of the Field, how they grow, they Toil not, neither do they Spin: And yet I say unto you, That even <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> in all his Glory, was not arrayed like one of these. Wherefore, if God so cloatheth the Grass of the Field, which to Day is, and to Morrow is cast into the Oven, shall he not much more cloath you? O ye of Little Faith! Therefore take no Tho't, saying, What shall we Eat, or what shall we Drink, or wherewithal shall we be Cloathed? (For after all those Things do the Gentiles seek) For your Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father knoweth, that you have need of all these Things</q>. But seek you first the Kingdom of <q>God, and his Righteousness, and all these Things shall be added unto you. Take therefore no Tho't for to Morrow, for to Morrow shall take Thought for the Things of it self; Sufficient is the Day for the Evil thereof.</q> Oh! how Plain, how Sweet, how Full, yet how Brief are his blessed <hi>Sentences!</hi> They thereby shew from whence they came, and that <hi>Divinity</hi> it self spoke them: What are Labour'd, what are Forced and Scattered in the best of other Writers, and not all neither, is here compriz'd after a natural, easie and conspicuous Manner. He sets Nature above Art, and Trust above Care. This is He that himself came Poor into the World, and so
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:006041_0410_0F6470182A220A90"/>
lived in it: He <hi>lay in a Manger,</hi> conversed with Mechanicks; <hi>Fasted</hi> much, <hi>Retired</hi> often: And when He <hi>Feasted,</hi> it was with <hi>Barly Leaves</hi> and Fish, dress'd doubtless in an easie and homely Manner. He was <hi>Solitary</hi> in his <hi>Life,</hi> in his <hi>Death Ignominious: The Foxes had Holes, the Birds of the Air had Nests, but the</hi> Son <hi>of</hi> Man <hi>had not a place whereon to lay his Head.</hi> He that made All Things as <hi>God,</hi> had No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as <hi>Man;</hi> which hath this blessed <hi>Instruction</hi> in it, that the Meanest and Poorest should not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, nor yet the <hi>Richest</hi> and <hi>Highest</hi> be exalted. In fine, having <hi>Taught</hi> this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Lived as</hi> he spoke, he Dyed to Confirm it; and <hi>offer'd up himself a Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World,</hi> when no other Sacrifice could be found, that could attone for Man with God: Who <hi>rising above the Power of Death and the Grave, hath led Captivity Captive,</hi> and is become the <hi>first Born from the Dead, and Lord of the Living;</hi> and his Living People Praise him, who is worthy for ever.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> who was the <hi>Fore runner</hi> of Christ's Appearance in Flesh, did by his own <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence</hi> sufficiently declare what sort of Person it was he came to <hi>prepare</hi> and bespeak People to receive. For, tho' <hi>sanctified</hi> in his <hi>Mother's Womb,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by <hi>Christ,</hi> to be the <hi>greatest</hi> of all Prophets, yet his Cloathing was but a Coarse Garment of <hi>Camels Hair,</hi> and a <hi>Leathern Girdle,</hi> and his <hi>Food</hi> only <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs</hi> and <hi>Wild Honey:</hi> A Life very Natural and of great Simplicity, This was all the <hi>Pomp</hi> and <hi>Retinue,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>§. 3. <hi>Peter, Andrew, Philip,</hi> and the rest of the Holy <hi>Apostles,</hi> were by Calling as well as Doctrine, not a <hi>Luxurious</hi> People; for they were made up of poor <hi>Fishermen</hi> and <hi>Mechanicks:</hi> For Christ called not his <hi>Disciples</hi> out of <hi>higher</hi> Ranks of Men, nor had they Ability as well as Will, to use the <hi>Excesses</hi> herein reproved. You may conceive what their lives were, by what their <hi>Masters</hi> Doctrine was; for they were the true Scholars of his Heavenly Discipline. <hi>Peter</hi> thus speaks, and exhorteth the Christians of his time, <q>Let not your Adorning be that outward Adorning of Plating the <hi>Hair,</hi> and the Wearing
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:006041_0412_0F64701A0D814680"/>
of Gold, and of putting on of Apparel; but let it be the Hidden Man of the Heart, in that which is not Corruptible, even the Ornament of a Meek and Quiet Spirit, which is in the sight of God of great Price; for after this manner in the old Time, the holy Women, who also trusted in God, Adorned themselves. Wherefore gird up the Loins of your Minds, be Sober, and hope to the end, as obedient Children, not Fashioning your selves according to your former Lusts, in your Ignorance, but as he, which hath called you is Holy, so be you Holy, in all manner of Conversation, and giving all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, adding to your Faith, Vertue; to Vertue, Knowledge; and to Knowledge, Temperance; and to Temperance, Patience; and to Patience, Godliness; and to Godliness, Brotherly Kindness; and to Brotherly Kindness, Charity; for if these things be in you and abound, they make you that you shall be neither Barren nor Unfruitful: For so an entrance shall be ministred unto you abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ: Not rendring Evil for Evil, or Railing for Railing; but contrariwise, Blessing; knowing, that ye are thereunto called, that ye should Inherit a Blessing: For even hereunto were ye called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an Example, that we should follow his Steps, who did no Sin, neither was Guile found in his Mouth; who, when he was Reviled, he Reviled not again; when he suffer'd, he threatned not, but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.</q>

                     <hi>for all his Steps are numbred; in his Touch, in his Ornaments, in his Hearing, Sight, Speech, and other Vanities. And therefore we will prove, first by the Scripture, and afterwards by divers others Reasons, how wicked a Thing it is to</hi> Dance. The first Testimony that we will produce, is that which we read in the Gospel, where 'tis said, It <hi>pleased</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod <hi>so well, that it cost</hi> John <hi>Baptist his Life. The Second is in</hi> Exodus, <hi>when</hi> Moses <hi>coming near to the Congregation, saw the Calf,</hi> he cast the <hi>Tables</hi> from him, and broke them at the foot of the Mountain; and afterwards it cost Three and Twenty Thousand of their Lives. <hi>Besides, the Ornaments which Women wear in their</hi> Dances, are as Crowns for many <hi>Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, which the Devil hath got against the Children of God, for the Devil hath not only one Sword in the Dance, but as many as there are beautiful and well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned Persons in the</hi> Dance; <hi>for the</hi> words of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man are a glittering <hi>Sword. And therefore that place is much to be feared, wherein the Enemy hath so many Swords, since that only one Sword of his may be justly feared.</hi> Again, <hi>The Devil in this place Strikes with a</hi> sharpned Sword; for the Women (who make it acceptable) come not willingly to the <hi>Dance,</hi> if they be not Painted and Adorned; which (Painting and Ornament) is as a <hi>Whetstone,</hi> on which the <hi>Devil
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:006041_0430_0F647028A69D8F20"/>
sharpneth his Sword.—They that deck and Adorn their Daughters,</hi> are like those that put dry <hi>Wood</hi> to the <hi>Fire,</hi> to the End it may Burn the better: For such Women kindle the Fire of <hi>Luxury</hi> in the Hearts of Men.

They proceed, The Devil in the <hi>Dance</hi> useth the strongest Armour that he hath; for his most powerful Arms are Women: Which is made plain unto us, in that the Devil made choice of the Woman to deceive the <hi>first Man:</hi> So did <hi>Balaam,</hi> that the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> might be rejected of God. By a Woman he made <hi>Sampson, David</hi> and <hi>Absalom</hi> to Sin. The Devil Tempteth <hi>Men</hi> by <hi>Women</hi> three manner of ways; that is, by the <hi>Touch,</hi> by the <hi>Eye,</hi> by the <hi>Ear,</hi> by these three Means he Tempteth foolish Men to Dancing, by touching their <hi>Hands,</hi> beholding their <hi>Beauty,</hi> hearing their <hi>Songs</hi> and <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick.</hi>—Again, They that Dance, break that Promise and Agreement they have made with God in Baptism, when their God-fathers promise for them, <hi>That they shall renounce the Devil and all his Pomp;</hi> for Dancing is the Pomp of the Devil; and he that Danceth, maintaineth his Pomp, and singeth his Mass.

speaks Falsly against the Truth (and for some little Honour, or secret lascivious End, denies what's True; or affirms what's False.) <hi>Against the Tenth,</hi> When Women affect the Ornaments of others, and Men covet the Wives, Daughters and Servants of their Neighbours (which undeniably attends all such Plays and Sports.) Again, A man may prove how great an Evil Dancing is, by the multitude of Sins that accompany those that Dance; for they Dance without Measure or Number: And therefore, saith <hi>Augustine,</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">August. de Civit. Dei.</note> The miserable Dancer knows not, that as many Paces as he makes in Dancing, so many leaps he makes to Hell. They Sin in their Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments after a five-fold manner: <hi>First,</hi> By being Proud thereof. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By enflaming the Hearts of those that behold them. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When they make those ashamed, that have not the like Ornaments, giving them occasion to covet the like. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Women Importunate in demanding the like Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of their Husbands: And, <hi>fifthly,</hi> When they cannot obtain them of their Husbands, they seek to get them elsewhere by Sin. <hi>They Sin by Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Playing on Instruments;</hi> for their Songs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch the Hearts of those that hear them with Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Delight; <hi>forgetting God;</hi> uttering nothing in their Songs but <hi>Lyes</hi> and <hi>Vanities;</hi> and the very Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body, which is used in <hi>Dancing,</hi> gives Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony enough of <hi>Evil.—Thus you see, that Dancing is the</hi> Devil's Precession, <hi>and he that enters into a Dance, enters into the</hi> Devil's Procession. <hi>Of</hi> Dancing, <hi>the</hi> Devil

                  <p>§. 8. <hi>Cardinal Wolsey,</hi> the most Absolute and Wealthy Minister of State this Kingdom ever had, that in his time seem'd to Govern <hi>Europe</hi> as well as <hi>England,</hi> when come to the Period of this Life, left the World, with this close Reflection upon himself. "Had I been as diligent to serve My God, as I was to please my King, he would not have left me now in my Gray Hairs." A dismal Reflection for all worldly minded Men; but those more especially who have the Power and Means of doing more Good than ordinary in the World, and do it not; which seems to have been the Case and Reflection of this Great Man.</p>

In me behold the End of this <hi>World,</hi> and all its <hi>Vanities.</hi>" And indeed he was not much out, in saying so, since in him was to be seen the End of all Natural Parts, Acquired Learning, and Civil Accomplishments.

                        <head>Sir Walter Rawleigh's Letter to his Wife, after his Condemnation.</head>
                        <p>YOU shall receive, <hi>my dear Wife,</hi> my last Words in these my last Lines. My <hi>Love</hi> I send you, <hi>That</hi> you may keep when I am Dead; and my <hi>Counsel,</hi> that you may remember it when I am no more. I would not, with my Will, present you Sorrows, <hi>Dear Bess;</hi> let them go to the Grave with Me, and be buried in the Dust: And, seeing that it is not the Will of God, that I shall see you any more, bear my <hi>Destruction</hi> patiently; and with an Heart like your self. <hi>First,</hi> I send you all the Thanks, which my Heart can conceive, or my Words express, for your many Travels and Cares for me; which, tho' they have not taken Effect, as you wished, yet my Debt to you is not the less; but pay it I never shall in this World. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I beseech you, for the Love you bear me Living, that you do not hide your self many Days; <hi>but by your Travels seek to help my miserable Fortunes, and the Right of your poor</hi> Child; <hi>Your Mourning cannot avail me, who am but</hi> Dust. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You shall understand, that my Lands were conveyed (<hi>bona fide</hi>) to my Child; the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were drawn at <hi>Midsummer</hi> was a Twelve Month, as divers can witness; and I trust, my Blood

will quench their Malice, who desired my Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they will not seek to <hi>Kill You</hi> and <hi>Yours</hi> with extream Poverty. To what Friend to direct you, I know not; for all mine have left me in the true time of Tryal: Most sorry am I, that being surprized by Death, I can leave you no better E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state; God hath prevented all my Determinations, that Great God, which worketh All in All. If you can live free from Want, care for no more; for the rest is but a <hi>Vanity. Love God,</hi> and begin betimes; in Him shall you find true, everlasting and endless Comfort: When you have travell'd and wearied your self with all sorts of worldly Cogitations, you shall sit down by Sorrow in the end. Teach your <hi>Son</hi> also to <hi>Serve</hi> and <hi>fear God,</hi> whilst he is <hi>Young,</hi> that the Fear of God may grow up in him; then will God be an <hi>Husband</hi> to You, and a <hi>Father</hi> to Him; an <hi>Husband</hi> and a <hi>Father</hi> that can never be taken from You. <hi>Dear Wife,</hi> I beseech you for my Souls sake, <hi>Pay all poor Men.</hi> When I am Dead, no doubt but you will be much sought unto; for the World thinks I was very Rich: Have a care to the fair Pretences of Men; for no greater Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery can befal you in this Life, than to become a Prey unto the World, and after to be despised. As, for Me, I am no more yours, nor you Mine: <hi>Death</hi> hath cut us asunder; and God hath divided me from the World, and you from Me, Remember your poor <hi>Child,</hi> for his <hi>Father'</hi>s sake, who loved you in his Happiest Estate. I sued for my Life, but (God

will receive with Kindness the last Office of your Friend.

I will not speak ought of the Vanity of this <hi>World;</hi> your own <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> will save that <hi>Labour:</hi> But there is a certain Thing that goeth up and down the World, called <hi>Religion, dressed and pretended Phantastically, and to Purposes bad enough, which yet by such evil Dealing loseth not its Being.</hi> The Great Good God hath not left it without a <hi>Witness, more or less, sooner or later, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man's Bosom, to direct us in the pursuit of it;</hi> and for the avoiding of those Inextricable Disquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Entanglements our own frail Reasons would perplex us withal; God in his Infinite Mercy hath given us <hi>His Holy Word,</hi> in which, as there are many Things hard to be Understood, so there is enough Plain and Easie to Quiet our Minds, and direct us concerning our Future Being. I confess to God and You, I have been a great Neglecter, and (I fear) Despiser of it: (God of his Infinite Mercy pardon me the dreadful Fault.) But when I retired my self from the Noise and deceitful Vanity of the World, I found no true Comfort in any other Resolution, than

So that my Religion is the good Spirit of God in my Heart; I mean, what that has wrought in me, and for me.</q> And after a Meeting at his House, to which he gave an entire Liberty, for all that pleased to come; he was so deeply affected with the Testimony of the <hi>Light, Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Grace of Christ in Man,</hi> as the <hi>Gospel Dispensation;</hi> that after the Meeting closed in Prayer, he rose up, and pulled off his Hat, and said, <q>This is the Everlasting Gospel I have heard this Day; and I humbly Bless the Name of God, that he has let me live to see this Day, in which the Ancient Gospel is again preached to them that dwell upon the Earth.</q>

Since the Time that I gave up my Liberty to God, as I told you, I was given to understand, to what a State of <hi>Annihilation</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> must be brought, to render it capable of <hi>Union</hi> with him: I saw my Soul reduced into a small point, contracted and shrunk up to nothing: And at the same time I beheld myself, as if encompassed with whatsoever the World Loves and Possesseth; and as it were, a Hand removing all this far from me, throwing it into the <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>Annihilation.</hi> In the first place, I saw removed all <hi>Exterior Things, Kingdoms, Great Offices, stately Buildings, Rich Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold stuff, Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver, Recreations, Pleasures;</hi> all which are great Incumbrances to the Souls pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing on to God; of which therefore his Pleasure is, that she be stripped, that she may arrive at the point of Nakedness and Death, which will bring
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:006041_0486_0F64705943C10F40"/>
her into Possession of solid Riches, and real Life. Assure your self, there is no Security in any Estate, but this of <hi>Dying</hi> and <hi>Annihilation;</hi> which is, to be <hi>Baptized into Christ's Death,</hi> that we live the Life of Mortification. Our best way is therefore, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest our selves of All, that the <hi>Holy Child</hi> Jesus may govern All. All that can be Imagin'd in this lower World, is of small Concernment, tho' it were the Losing of all our Goods, and the Death of all the Men in it; this poor <hi>Ant hill</hi> is not worthy of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Thought. Had we but a little <hi>Faith,</hi> and a little <hi>Love,</hi> how happy should we esteem our selves, in giving away all to attend no more, save on God alone; and to say, <hi>Deus meus, &amp; omnia!</hi> My God, and my All! Being <hi>(saith he)</hi> in a Chapel richly Wainscotted, and Adorned with very excellent <hi>Sculpture,</hi> and with <hi>Imagery.</hi> I beheld it with some Attention, having had some Skill in these Things, and saw the Bundles of <hi>Flowers de Luces,</hi> and of Flowers in form of Borders, and of very curious Workmanship; it was on a sudden put into my Mind, <hi>The Original of what thou seest, would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thee at all in seeing it.</hi> And I perceived, that indeed all these, and those <hi>Flowers</hi> themselves (not in Pictures) would not have taken me up; and all the <hi>Ornaments</hi> which Architecture and Art Invent, are but Things most mean and low, running in a manner only upon <hi>Flowers, Fruits, Branches, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies</hi> and <hi>Chymera's,</hi> part whereof are in their very Being, but things Common and Low, and part of
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:006041_0487_0F647059C8537070"/>
them meerly <hi>Imaginary;</hi> and yet Man (who crouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to every Thing) renders himself Amorous and a <hi>Slave</hi> of them; no otherwise than as if a good <hi>Workman</hi> should stand to copy out, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit some Trifles and Fopperies. I consider'd by this sight how poor Man was to be <hi>cheated, amused</hi> and <hi>diverted</hi> from his <hi>Sovereign Good.</hi> And since that time, I could make no more Stand to consider any of these Things: And if I did it, I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach my self for it; as no sooner seeing them in <hi>Churches</hi> or else where, but this is presently put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Spirit, The Original is Nothing, the Copy and the Image is yet Less; each Thing is Vain, except the Employment of our selves about God alone. An absolute <hi>Abnegation</hi> will be necessary to all Things, to follow in <hi>Simplicity,</hi> without reserve or Reflection, what our Saviour shall work in us, or appoint for us, let it be This or That. This Way was shewed me, in which I ought to walk towards him; and hence it is, that all Things to me ordinarily are without any <hi>Gust</hi> and <hi>Delight.</hi> I assure you, it is a great Shame to a <hi>Christian</hi> to pass his Days in this World more at Ease than <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> here passed his: Ah! Had we but a little Faith, what Repose could we take out of the <hi>Cross.</hi>

                  <p>Expressions of that Weight and Moment to the immortal Good of Men, that they abundantly prove, to all sensible Readers, that the <hi>Author</hi> was a Man of an Enlightned Mind, and of a Soul <hi>Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to the World and Quickned to some Tastes of a Supernatural Life: Let his <hi>Youth,</hi> let his <hi>Quality,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with so much <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> so much <hi>Self-denial</hi> and <hi>Constancy,</hi> become exemplary to those of Worldly Quality, who may be the <hi>Readers</hi> of this Book. Some perhaps will hear that Truth from the several <hi>Authors</hi> I have reported, whose Names, Death and Time have recover'd from the <hi>Envy</hi> of Men, that would hardly endure it from me, if at all from the Living. Be it as it will, I shall abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, if God shall please to make any part of this Discourse effectual to perswade any into the love of Holiness, <hi>without which,</hi> certain it is, <hi>no Man shall see the Lord:</hi> But the <hi>Pure in Heart</hi> shall behold Him for ever.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I cannot pass this Reflection upon what is observed of the Sayings of Dying Men, and which to me seems to have great Instruction in it, <abbr>

our Enemies, and Praying for them, are solid Things, and the Essential Part of Religion, as the true Ground of Man's Happiness. Then all Sin is <hi>exceeding Sinful,</hi> and yields no more Pleasure: But every inordinate Desire is <hi>Burthensome,</hi> and severely reproved. Then the World, with all the <hi>Lawful</hi> Comforts in it, weighs light against that Sense and Judgment, which such Men have between the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> and <hi>Eternal.</hi> And since it is thus with dying Men, what Instruction is in it to the Living, whose Pretence for the most part is a <hi>Perpetual Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Oh that Men would learn to <hi>number their Days, that they might apply their Hearts to Wisdom;</hi> of which the Fear of the Lord is the <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Only Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi> And <hi>Blessed are they that Fear always, for their Feet shall be preserved from the Snare of Death.</hi>

Certainly, much more impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is it to forsake the greater.
