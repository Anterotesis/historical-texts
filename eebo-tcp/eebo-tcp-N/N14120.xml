            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THOUGH unconvinced by your arguments, I am pleaſed with the temper you diſcover; and am happy to find, you can unite the <hi>moderation</hi> of a <hi>fair diſputant</hi> with the <hi>candour</hi> of a <hi>chriſtian.</hi> Unlike ſome others, who have engaged in the controverſy, you attack <hi>opinions,</hi> and not their <hi>author,</hi> wiſely conſidering others may differ from you in ſentiment, without being <hi>inſidious</hi> foes to the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of mankind. However—though recommended by ſo much candour and moderation, I am ſtill under the diſagreeable neceſſity of diſſenting from your reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſyſtem. Nor can I calmly reſign up a number of my ſpecies to everlaſting miſery, notwithſtanding all you have ſaid to prove it conſiſtent with the juſtice of God, and eſſential to his glory. I have ſuch a veneration for my creator, as to ſuppoſe he needs no foil to ſet off his perfections: Such an opinion of the ſaints, as to imagine they could reliſh <hi>their</hi> felicity,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017870_0003_0FA37BD6020FE888"/>
without being ſpectators of the miſery of the damned. I place ſuch a value upon the merits and death of my redeemer, as to conclude all will be happy for whom he ſuffered on the croſs. And I pay ſuch a regard to the poſitive declarations of ſcripture, as to antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the reſtitution of all things;—when the ruins of the fall ſhall be more than repaired, and <hi>the creature which now groans ſhall groan no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe few hints it muſt be evident to all, the Gods we reſpectively ſerve are very unlike each other; and that our proſpects beyond the grave do as widely differ. The God, to whom <hi>you</hi> pay your religious homage, needs the introduction of ſin and miſery, in order to illuſtrate his own character, and diſplay his divine perfections. <hi>I</hi> bow my knee to a power <hi>intrinſecally</hi> excellent, who can ſhine without contraſt; whoſe glory is eſſential; whoſe happineſs is immutable; and who would be the admiration of all his creatures, even were guilt and ſuffering baniſhed the univerſe. <hi>You</hi> expect to look down from heaven upon numbers of wretched objects, confined in the pit of hell, and blaſpheming their creator forever. <hi>I</hi> hope to ſee the priſon-doors opened; and to hear thoſe tongues, which are now profaning the name of God, chanting his praiſe. In one word, <hi>you</hi> imagine the divine glory will be advanced by immortalizing ſin and miſery; <hi>I</hi> by exterminating both natural and moral evil, and introducing univerſal happineſs. Which of our ſyſtems is beſt ſupported, let reaſon and ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture determine. Of this I am certain, we equally differ from the ORTHODOX ſentiments of our country; and for this reaſon, <hi>I</hi> ought to be heard with the ſame candour which hath been exerciſed towards <hi>you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:017870_0004_0FA37BD6C2FE4BE0"/>I muſt confeſs, I was not a little ſurprized, when I obſerved the reception your pamphlet met with, even from perſons, who ſtyle themſelves CALVINISTS: and pretend <hi>they</hi> are the only true followers of our venerable fathers. Could thoſe pious worthies (for ſuch I <hi>really</hi> eſteem them) return to this world, they would reprobate <hi>your</hi> doctrines as earneſtly as they would <hi>mine. Univerſal redemption,</hi> which <hi>you</hi> allow, they never admitted as an article of their faith. But <hi>that,</hi> and many other points, advanced in your pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, they conſidered as fatal <hi>hereſies,</hi> ſubverſive of the true goſpel, and deſtructive to the ſouls of men. What then muſt I think of thoſe ſerious perſons, who condemn all innovations in religion, and profeſs the antient CALVINISTIC doctrines of this country? Either, that they (like many other honeſt men) have changed their opinions; or that they do not rightly apprehend their own religious ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>That controverſy may be ſo conducted as to injure chriſtianity, I am very ſenſible: And no leſs ſo, that it may be turned to the very great advantage of divine truth. This appears to be your opinion, and I readily acquieſce in it. I agree with you, that "all doctrines ſuppoſedly erroneous," ought to be tried by the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of the holy ſcripture. And that a "a diſpoſition to check every thing of the kind can be only attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to a want of proper zeal, in the cauſe of truth." It is indeed hard to conceive, how a good man can ſee a doctrine borne down, which he eſteems the glory of the goſpel; or a ſentiment propagated, which <hi>he</hi> imagines to be deſtructive of all virtue. Your zeal, therefore, in oppoſing the doctrines of the reformation, as well as thoſe contained in a certain pamphlet, is an undoubted evidence of your chriſtian ſincerity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:017870_0005_0FA37BD789EB9CA0"/>But to return to the work which is the more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate occaſion of this letter. I ſhall only take notice, at preſent, of the more exceptionable parts of your book. As ſoon as any will undertake the publication of it, you ſhall have a complete reply to the whole.</p>
            <p>And I am the rather determined not to enlarge on this occaſion, as I apprehend you have given up the matter in diſpute, in the very firſt argument you bring againſt it. Your comment upon 1 Tim. ii. 3. and 1 Tim. iv. 10. leads to a concluſion of which you are not aware. I am ready to appeal to thoſe who are moſt prejudiced in favour of your work, whether, upon your own principles, <hi>the final ſalvation of all men</hi> does not neceſſarily follow. It were needleſs, therefore, to purſue you farther, till the error of this concluſion be detected.</p>
            <p>The paſſages, to which I referred, are as follows. "God our ſaviour, who will have all men to be ſaved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth." 1 Tim. ii. 3. "The living God, who is the ſaviour of all men, eſpecially of thoſe that believe." 1 Tim iv. 10. The former of theſe texts you explain after the uſual manner; as intimating a deſire that "all people, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and claſſes of men" ſhould become acquainted with the goſpel, and be made partakers of the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there revealed. In your 9th page, you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there is a foundation laid for the <hi>univerſal</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowment of life. Your words are,—"according to the expreſs word of God, it is plain, that mercy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be granted without an atonement; and where it cannot be granted, it ſurely cannot be offered; and therefore, an offer of mercy, ſo compleat and univerſal as has been mentioned, muſt ſuppoſe an atonement
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017870_0006_0FA37BD841C8C598"/>
equally compleat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſufficient for the ſalvation of the whole world." I agree with you, in oppoſition to all the CALVINISTS that ever wrote upon the ſubject, that nothing could be a greater inſult on the weakneſs and miſery of mankind, than to offer them all ſalvation, unleſs there was a foundation laid for the beſtowment of it. And I further acknowledge, "<hi>the obedience and death of Chriſt</hi>" are the moral ground of that general proclamation which is made in the goſpel, and the pardon which is offered unto all men."</p>
            <p>Let us now ſee what is the conſequence of ſuch a conceſſion. According to your own principles, Jeſus Chriſt has made a complete atonement for the ſins of the whole world. He hath "taſted death for every creature." At the expence of his precious blood, he hath "brought pardon, life and immortality to every man." So that, in conſequence of <hi>his</hi> merits and death, <hi>every individual</hi> of the human race <hi>may</hi> be happy in the future ſtate; and God earneſtly deſires it. This I take to be your real meaning, from your remarks on the firſt and ſecond paſſages of ſcripture adduced by <hi>Mr. White.</hi> I am not ſenſible of any miſrepreſentation.</p>
            <p>But the concluſion <hi>I</hi> draw from hence is very different from the opinion <hi>you</hi> have undertaken to defend. The doctrine of <hi>univerſal redemption</hi> neceſſarily infers <hi>univerſal ſalvation.</hi> You allow the former, why would you diſpute the latter? If Chriſt died for all, ſurely <hi>all</hi> will be <hi>finally happy.</hi> If the atonement be <hi>complete</hi> and <hi>univerſal,</hi> then <hi>univerſal happineſs</hi> muſt enſue. This the apoſtle has inconteſtably proved, in his epiſtle to the Romans, as we ſhall ſee hereafter. Nor do I know of any but thoſe who are commonly
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017870_0007_0FA37BD901E853B8"/>
ſtyled <hi>Arminians,</hi> that call this in queſtion. The <hi>Orthodox</hi> univerſally ſuppoſe, that all will be ſaved for whom the ſon of God made an atonement. They would not ſo undervalue the merits and death of Chriſt, as to aſſert the contrary.</p>
            <p>Allowing then, our divine redeemer died for <hi>all,</hi> and that God, their heavenly father, is <hi>deſirous</hi> of their everlaſting felicity, it muſt follow, that all will, in due time, "come to the knowledge of the truth and be ſaved." What ſhould hinder the future accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the divine will; or the final ſucceſs of Chriſt's mediatorial undertaking? <hi>Our</hi> wiſhes are often fruſtrated: but God cannot be diſappointed. Inaſmuch as the ſaviour of the world has atoned for the ſins of every creature, and God earneſtly deſires the ſalvation of <hi>all,</hi> it is inconceivable that any ſhould periſh everlaſtingly. His infinite power, wiſdom and goodneſs forbid ſuch a diſhonourable ſuppoſition. If theſe attributes belong to God, he muſt be able and willing to reduce <hi>all men</hi> to a ſtate of moral ſubjection to his authority. And if ſo, he certainly will not fail to do it, We may therefore, congratulate mankind up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their future proſpects; and aſſure them of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into heaven, as ſoon as they are qualified for its ſervices and entertainments.</p>
            <p>To this, I know, it is commonly objected, that men are <hi>free agents,</hi> and conſequently may reſiſt all the meaſures, God uſes for their reformation and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. But, I muſt confeſs, I do not ſee how this concluſion follows. Though <hi>free,</hi> yet ſurely, infinite power, guided by infinite wiſdom, and excited by infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodneſs, may deviſe ſuch a ſcheme, as ſhall bring <hi>all men</hi> into a ſtate of moral ſubjection, without
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017870_0008_0FA37BD9C1C06128"/>
breaking in upon their <hi>liberty</hi> It would be a groſs reflexion upon the great Jehovah to ſuppoſe him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of doing this. He <hi>muſt</hi> be able to treat all his creatures in ſuch a manner, as ſhall lead them to act a wiſe and rational part. And he <hi>will</hi> do it, if he ſincerely deſires their happineſs. To ſay therefore, that God "<hi>wills</hi> all men ſhou'd come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, and be ſaved," is virtually declaring that the whole human race will be finally happy. <hi>His deſiring</hi> they ſhould be ſaved, <hi>muſt</hi> iſſue in their everlaſting ſalvation. And this falls in with the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinian</hi> doctrine reſpecting this point.
<q>The <hi>will</hi> of God (ſay the divines of that denomination) is <hi>efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore, he cannot fall ſhort of his purpoſe. If he <hi>willed</hi> all men to be ſaved, he would ſave them <hi>effectually.</hi> It is annihilating his <hi>Omnipotence</hi> to ſay, he <hi>deſires</hi> to ſave all men, but that he cannot.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon your own principles then, I muſt conclude againſt the ſenſe you put upon theſe texts of ſcripture. However, I will do you the juſtice to own, your ſentiments are, in ſome reſpects, more liberal than thoſe which have received the ſtamp of <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> in this country. <hi>Calviniſtic</hi> writers will admit the ſalvation of all for whom Chriſt died, but then, they pretend, he died only for the <hi>Elect.</hi> The <hi>Weſtminſter Divines,</hi> who were under a ſolemn oath, to maintain nothing, in point of doctrine, but what they believed, expreſs themſelves in the following words. "By the decree of God, ſome men and angels are predeſtinated unto everlaſting life, and others fore-ordained to everlaſting death. Thoſe of mankind, that are predeſtinated unto life. God, before the foundation of the world was laid, choſe in Chriſt to everlaſting glory, out of his meer
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017870_0009_0FA37BDA8013DDF0"/>
free grace and love, without any foreſight of faith, or good works. And as he hath appointed he <hi>Elect</hi> unto glory, ſo hath he fore-ordained the means thereunto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherefore they who are Elected, being fallen in Adam are redeemed by Chriſt. Neither are any others redeemed by Chriſt —but the Elect only" This was their idea of things, and, our fathers entertained the ſame opinion. You have receded to the other extreme. You ſuppoſe the atonement <hi>complete</hi> and <hi>univerſal.</hi> God according to <hi>you,</hi> wiſhes well <hi>to all</hi> his creatures, but ſuffers his kind wiſhes to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated. According to <hi>them,</hi> he neither deſires the happineſs of a great part of mankind, nor made them with any ſuch view. The God, you portray, is only deficient in wiſdom and power; <hi>theirs</hi> equally deſtitute of goodneſs and ſincerity.</p>
            <p>But to return —The offer of ſalvation being made to <hi>all,</hi> you argue the atonement, upon which that offer is grounded, muſt be <hi>complete</hi> and <hi>univerſal.</hi> That is, as you explain yourſelf, in virtue of the merits and death of Chriſt, <hi>all men</hi> are in a <hi>ſalvable ſtate.</hi> This is the <hi>truth,</hi> but not the whole <hi>truth.</hi> The death of our bleſſed ſaviour rendered the ſalvation of mankind not only a poſſible thing, but actually <hi>ſecured it to them in event.</hi> In a ſenſe, we are all <hi>juſtified, reconciled</hi> and <hi>ſaved.</hi> We are born into the world heirs of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. And the part, aſſigned us, is to acquire ſuch habits, and improve in ſuch graces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſhall fit us for the joys of heaven, at the reſurrection day. Hence God is ſtyled "the ſaviour of all men, eſpecially of thoſe that believe." In conſequence of the merits and ſacrifice of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eternal life is ſecured to every individual; though <hi>believers</hi> only will be <hi>firſt</hi> parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of it. Others, who die in their ſins muſt ſuffer
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017870_0010_0FA37BDB4169F040"/>
the conſequences of their diſobedience, and be reduced to a proper temper of mind, before they can be <hi>rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally</hi> and <hi>immortally happy.</hi> But ſhall <hi>they</hi> periſh forever? God forbid The ſaviour of mankind (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>your</hi> confeſſion) died for them, in common with others An atonement is already made for <hi>their</hi> ſins. And "through the obedience of one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the free gift hath come upon <hi>them</hi> to juſtification of life." The conſequence therefore, muſt be, that ſooner or later, <hi>they</hi> alſo will reap the benefits of Chriſt's mediatorial undertaking.</p>
            <p>This is ſtill further confirmed by the reaſoning of St. Paul in the 5th Chap of his epiſtle to the Romans, 8, 9, and 10th verſes. "But God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us. <hi>Much more</hi> then, being now juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him. For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God, by the death of his ſon, <hi>much more</hi> being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life." This reaſoning, upon <hi>my</hi> principles, is ſtrong and concluſive; upon <hi>yours,</hi> I can ſee no force or pertinence in it. Inſtead of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing <hi>a fortiori,</hi> as the apoſtle intended, you would make him trifle, in a manner unworthy ſo great a character. If I underſtand him right, the idea he would convey is this,—that in as much as God hath taken ſuch an extraordinary ſtep, as to deliver up his only begotten ſon for the <hi>ſinner</hi> and <hi>ungodly,</hi> we may rely on it, he will not fail to accompliſh his benevolent purpoſes, even their <hi>final reſtoration to favour,</hi> and <hi>everlaſting ſalvation.</hi> To illuſtrate my meaning, let me refer you to the 6, 7 and 8th verſes. Having mentioned the <hi>love of God,</hi> the apoſtle endeavours to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017870_0011_0FA37BDC01311590"/>
ſet forth the <hi>exceeding greatneſs</hi> of it from this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that it was while men were <hi>without ſtrength, ungodly</hi> and <hi>ſinners,</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt <hi>died for them.</hi> But, if ſuch was <hi>their</hi> moral ſtate for whom he ſuffered, MUCH MORE <hi>ſhall they be ſaved from wrath through him.</hi> In virtue of the atoning blood of Chriſt, theſe <hi>ſinners</hi> and <hi>ungodly</hi> are in a <hi>juſtified ſtate.</hi> Or, as the apoſtle expreſſes himſelf, thes;e <hi>enemies are reconciled to God</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They are all reſcued from that ſtate of <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>condemnation,</hi> to which they were reduced by the fall. God therefore, being now reconciled to theſe <hi>ſinners, enemies,</hi> and <hi>ungodly,</hi> the apoſtle would teach us to argue, that they ſhall <hi>eventually</hi> be ſaved by the death of his ſon. He would not have taken ſuch meaſures for the recovery of mankind, had he not intended to accompliſh their <hi>everlaſting ſalvation</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The application is obvious: There is an atonement for ſin <hi>complete</hi> and <hi>univerſal</hi>; and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in conſequence of it, <hi>the free gift has come upon</hi> ALL MEN <hi>to juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and life</hi> But whatever you underſtand by this <hi>juſtification</hi>; whether you include more or leſs in it, moſt certainly it follows from thence, that <hi>all men will be finally happy.</hi> For <hi>they all being juſtified by his blood,</hi> ſhall MUCH MORE <hi>be ſaved from wrath through him.</hi> In other words, the <hi>univerſal redemption,</hi> which <hi>you</hi> allow, <hi>muſt</hi> iſſue in the <hi>univerſal ſalvation,</hi> for which <hi>I</hi> contend.</p>
            <p>I have now examined your firſt argument, and cannot but think, you perceive the conſequences I have deduced from it. But bleſſed be God, the <hi>ſalvation of all men</hi> does not reſt merely upon theſe texts of ſcripture. The ſame glorious truth is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the 8th chapter of this epiſtle to the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017870_0012_0FA37BDCBB9860D0"/>
Romans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19, 20 and 21ſt verſes. <hi>For the earneſt expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifeſtation of the ſons of God. For the creature was made ſubject to vanity, not willingly, but by reaſon of him who hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the ſame in hope: Becauſe the</hi> CREATURE IT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELF <hi>alſo ſhall be</hi> DELIVERED FROM THE BON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAGE OF CORRUPTION, INTO THE GLORIOUS LIBERTY OF THE CHILDREN OF GOD." By the <hi>creature,</hi> we are to underſtand the <hi>whole rational creation.</hi> So the word is uſed in other places, as you may ſatisfy yourſelf by recurring to the <hi>Greek Original.</hi> And it is moſt poſitively declared, that the ſame moral intelligent creation, that is now ſubject to vanity ſhall hereafter be <hi>delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</hi> But <hi>all men,</hi> without exception, are ſubjected to vanity, therefore they ſhall <hi>all,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, be delivered from it; and inſtated in that freedom, which is the glory of <hi>rational be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and conſtitutes their <hi>ſupreme felicity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in order to qualify them for this happy ſtate, they will be <hi>all</hi> previouſly ſubjected to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing authority of God. They will be delivered from their ſins; their moral diſorder will be recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; their vicious habits ſubdued. Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to put an end to <hi>all vice and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</hi> He was manifeſted that he might <hi>deſtroy the works of the Devil</hi>: By which we are to underſtand <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral evil</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hence thoſe words of the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> John i. 29. "Behold the lamb of God, which taketh away the <hi>ſins of the world!</hi>" And the name <hi>Jeſus</hi> was conferred on him, becauſe he ſhould <hi>even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi> "ſave his people from their <hi>ſins.</hi>"</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:017870_0013_0FA37BDD847B1458"/>And having laid a foundation for univerſal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, in his death, God hath now crowned him with glory and honour. And this, not only as a reward for his humiliation, but the better to enable him to proſecute the benevolent deſign of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion even the <hi>Salvation of All.</hi> "God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name." No created power, either in heaven or earth, is able to <hi>control his authority.</hi> The conſequence is, "every knee will finally bow, and every tongue confeſs him Lord, to the glory of the father." God hath ſolemnly ſworn,—ſuch a ſtate of moral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to his authority ſhall univerſally take place; nor can we doubt of it, without giving him the lie.</p>
            <p>For theſe reaſons, Sir, (and numberleſs others, which I would produce, were it not for anticipating an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious work, where the ſubject is exhauſted) I muſt ſtill diſſent from you, reſpecting the final iſſue of our Lord's benevolent undertaking. The repeted declarations of ſcripture, as well as my own natural apprehenſions of the Deity, convince me, <hi>all men will be finally happy</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This, I am ſenſible, is a very unpopular doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. It meets with great oppoſition in the world; and is very prejudicial to the <hi>temporal intereſt</hi> of thoſe who have the courage to advance it. However, the queſtion is—<hi>not what is popular? but what is truth?</hi> A real friend to revelation will always contend for the <hi>latter</hi>; happy, if his zeal is imputed to a right prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and undiſcouraged, though it expoſes him to univerſal reproach.</p>
            <p>Many ſerious perſons are much concerned about the tendency of this doctrine. And you, Sir, ſeem to ſhare in the general alarm. But why ſuch uneaſy
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017870_0014_0FA37BDEC6DE4918"/>
apprehenſions? You give us to underſtand, that the great "ruler of heaven and earth permitted ſin to come into exiſtence, in order to give diſtinction to holineſs." And you plainly intimate, that there will be no more ſin in the world, than is neceſſary to raiſe the luſtre of its oppoſite; and by the force of contraſt, diſplay its beauty in a more ſtriking light. Why then are you alarmed at the doctrine of <hi>univerſal ſalvation?</hi> Suppoſe unthinking minds <hi>ſhould</hi> take the advantage of it? Suppoſe it <hi>ſhould</hi> be ſo perverted as to increaſe the number of bad men? Upon <hi>your</hi> principles, this ſhould be a matter of joy. The more wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there is in the world the more beautiful will holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs appear. The more will free grace be enhanced; and the more will God be known and admired by his rational creation. You ought therefore, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate a general reformation of manners. And if you ever prayed, it ſhould be for a ſpirit of deluſion, that ſtill greater numbers might ſin againſt God, and be damned everlaſtingly for <hi>his</hi> glory, and to give diſtinction to holineſs. I am ſurprized, you ſhould be ſo apprehenſive of prevailing impiety, when you are ſo well convinced of the ſolid advantages of it.</p>
            <p>But to return;—did you and other good minds really deprecate <hi>moral evil</hi>; did you wiſh to ſee it utterly exterminated, you would find nothing in the book you oppoſe, to fill you with uneaſy apprehenſions. It is for want of due examination, you pronounce ſo unfavourably upon it. I defy the art of man to prove that doctrine an encouragement to licenciouſneſs, which inſiſts, that <hi>a man will be miſerable, while he is wicked</hi>; and that <hi>he muſt be virtuous in order to be happy.</hi> If ſinners are puniſhed, in proportion to their guilt; and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017870_0015_0FA37BDF061C9728"/>
are excluded heaven, 'till they are humbled and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, all the ends of the vindicatory part of God's law are fully anſwered.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſyſtem of error,</hi> which to me appears moſt fatal to the morals of mankind, is that which makes God the efficient cauſe of all evil, and refers all our wicked actions to his divine agency. Had the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, you oppoſe, contained any thing of this kind, I ſhould readily have born teſtimony againſt it. I am not ignorant, that men would take the advantage of ſuch doctrines, and impiouſly charge all their vices upon the bleſſed God. Could they be once perſuaded, in their own minds, that (contrary to all experience) they had no will of their own; that they were only inſtruments in the hand of God, while <hi>he</hi> was the efficient cauſe of all the miſchief perpetrated in the world, they would be very unconcerned about their behaviour. They could not but perceive, on this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that virtue and vice were mere empty names.</p>
            <p>And yet, theſe are the doctrines, which have been proclaimed from the deſk; and offered to the world as truths of the goſpel. Leſt men ſhould reflect too ſeverely upon themſelves, for their wicked conduct, they are told, for their comfort, God is the efficient cauſe of all their actions: That ſin is infinitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to his glory: And that we ought to be thankful for all the immoralities which have diſgraced mankind! Theſe are the monſtrous errors, which appear to me moſt pernicious to the morals of ſociety. It is the propagation of theſe ſentiments I moſt dread, at this time of general licenciouſneſs. And would to heaven I may be miſtaken, in my ſuſpicions that <hi>you,</hi> Sir, have been betrayed into the ſame error. From ſome
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017870_0016_0FA37BDFC1CFB308"/>
expreſſions, in the latter part of your book, I was not without my fears; though I ſhould be happy to find they were wholly without foundation.</p>
            <p>No man, who is not ſtrangely infatuated, will deny that <hi>modern fataliſm</hi> is infinitely more prejudicial to the morals of ſociety than the doctrine of a <hi>final reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> Our fathers, who were eſteemed the ſtandard of ORTHODOXY, would have reprobated the former, though they might not have fallen in with the latter. The <hi>Fataliſt</hi> would have fared as ill with them, as the advocate for <hi>Univerſal Salvation.</hi> It is to be hoped, therefore, thoſe good people, who profeſs the religious opinions of our fathers, will not diſcharge all their indignation upon the <hi>Univerſaliſt,</hi> while there are other doctrines, as unlike their own, propagated in the world. While they ſhudder at the conſequences of what they improperly ſtyle the <hi>new doctrine,</hi> let them tremble at the others. And while they condemn the <hi>Univerſaliſt,</hi> let them not paſs by the <hi>Fataliſt,</hi> unnoticed and unreproved. Otherwiſe, they will give juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect their <hi>Zeal is without knowledge,</hi> and that they are actuated by ſome other principle, than a real concern for the truth. I mention this, becauſe the <hi>hereſy,</hi> of which I have been ſpeaking, is paſſed over in ſilence, by thoſe very perſons, who profeſs the ſame religious opinions with our fathers.</p>
            <p>But not to enlarge — The work, which I have more than once mentioned, will anſwer all the objections hitherto urged againſt the <hi>final ſalvation of all men.</hi> Referring you therefore, to <hi>that,</hi> for further ſatisfaction, let me take leave with the following ſerious enquiry.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017870_0017_0FA37BE086B53960"/>
Do you not really think the <hi>glory of God,</hi> will be more advanced by the <hi>final happineſs of the whole human kind,</hi> than the everlaſting perdition of any? If, by his wiſe and benevolent meaſures, he reduces <hi>all men</hi> to a willing ſubjection to his authority, and then fixes them in a ſtate of unending felicity, will it not redound more to his honour, than if he left them in utter ruin? Is it not undervaluing the blood of Chriſt, to ſuppoſe he died for any who will periſh everlaſtingly? And can we reconcile the providential adminiſtrations of God, but upon the ſuppoſition of <hi>final, univerſal happineſs?</hi> If we can not, let us not ſtart at a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which reflects ſo much honour upon God, and places ſuch a juſt value upon the ſacrifice of his ſon. We can not think too highly of the former, nor ought we to ſet bounds to the happy conſequences of the latter.</p>
            <p>And as for thoſe ſerious perſons, who expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſo much bitterneſs upon the ſubject of <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Salvation,</hi> let me aſk them, whether they imagine its advocates have any worldly ends in view, in publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſentiments to mankind? Will it promote their temporal intereſt? Will it procure them friends? Will it advance their reputation? If it will do neither, they ought, at leaſt, to be treated as <hi>well meaning enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts,</hi> and not as ſecret enemies to the good order of ſociety. Such candour, on the ſide of their opponents, would convince the world, <hi>they</hi> were honeſt in their objections; that they were really afraid of error, and not of expoſing their judgment, by reviewing their early notions, and receding from the principles of their education.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:017870_0018_0FA37BE14318E860"/>I will only add, if I am in an error, I pray God to convince me of it. I hope, I am open to convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. My temporal intereſt, my uſefulneſs, my repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the world, would be greatly advanced, by my returning to the common opinions of my fellow-chriſtians. To each of theſe I do a material injury, while I retain my preſent religious ſentiments. You will therefore, aſcribe my plainneſs to a right prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple—even <hi>a firm perſuaſion, in my own mind, that the goſpel contains nothing unfit for the world to know; that modern prudence is the falſe wiſdom condemned by our bleſſed ſaviour; and that the vulgar arts of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are equally unworthy the ſcholar, the divine, and the Chriſtian!</hi>
