            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Obſerve, in an Ordination Sermon Preached at <hi>Colcheſter</hi> about two year ago, a Lamentation made, that we have ſew or no ſtated and known Rules of Diſcipline in our Churches. This is alſo ſaid to have been the Lamentation of a worthy Divine lately deceaſed there. How general this Lamentation is, I know not; nor do I know any ground at all for it. I thought we had not been without ſuch Rules, ſince we have Bibles; how regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſoever we be, as to practical conformity to
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003838_0002_100262BF5925B6B0"/>them. I ſuppoſe we are not by profeſſion, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks: if we be, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> has provided us with Rules. But if we be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, it ſeems as if we ſhould own no other than the LORD to be our Law-giver, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 33.22. that he has made full proviſion for us, has given us his Law and Teſtimony, according to which we muſt ever ſpeak and act, as in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8 20. Has therein provided a thorough furniture for the Man of God, as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17. Nor has CHRIST directed his Miniſters to teach the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple any other Rules than what are therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, as in <hi>Mat</hi> 28.20. I had thought that the Legiſlative Power had been lodged intirely in CHRIST our Law-giver as well as Judge; that Miniſters, Churches, Councils, &amp;c. had nothing to do to make Rules for Government or Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; but were ever to keep cloſe to the Rules that CHRIST has made for us. If he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a thorough furniture for the Man of God, what has he left for us to do? Can we mend his Work, make his furniture ſtill more thorough? Did he not know the preſent ſtate of theſe Churches when he gave his Laws? Has he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly appointed us to ſuit Laws for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Circumſtances? In Civil Government in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Ordinances of Men are to be made and obeyed, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. But where is a word of any ſuch allowance in the Church of CHRIST? It ſeems as if our blaſphemous Pride, leads us to a conceit that we can perfect his Laws, whenas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we have nothing to do but to learn them,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003838_0003_100262C0F6C8DB48"/>govern by them and obey them. If indeed we differ in ſentiment about the meaning of theſe Laws or Rules, or are at a loſs as to the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, in matters of importance, we have the light of Nature and Scripture both directing us to apply for light to Councils, whoſe work it is, not dogmatically to determine Caſes (as has been of late the way) but themſelves to ſeek for Light by Prayer and other means, and having themſelves obtained Light, to lay it before them that ſend for them. <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what if they will not receive Light when offered to them? <hi>Anſw.</hi> The way in that Caſe is plain: Means muſt be uſed with them, and Patience exerciſed toward them; and if yet they will not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed till their ſin ariſe to Hereſy or Scandal, CHRIST plainly tells us what is to be done with them, whether they be particular Perſons, or whole Churches, in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6, 14. &amp; <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what if Chriſtians be uncertain whether what they have againſt their Miniſters or others, amount to Scandal or no; may they not ſend for Councils, and, having raked up what they can againſt them, lay it before the Council, that they may ſee whether it may not amount to Scandal?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>(1) This is indeed the late way, and is expreſly croſs to <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.16. And no way agrees with the diſpoſition of a citizen of <hi>Zion,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.3.</item>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:003838_0004_100262C4B5DA25E8"/>
                  <item>(2) In caſe of uncertainty as to what amounts to Scandal, Councils may be called to ſearch for Light, whereby to determine the caſe, without throwing reproaches on any that are ſuſpected to have done what amounts thereto. Can't a caſe be ſuppoſed and determined without an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſcriptural application of it to any particular perſon?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>It is wonderful to ſee what pleas are made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Platform, in a late Print called <hi>New-England's</hi> Lamentations. There be indeed good things in it; particularly, what is judiciouſly ſaid of the pernicious Principles of the Arminians. But how very exceptionable are many things in it? For inſtance, in Page 35, that the Churches may chooſe Ruling Elders, in oppoſition to their Paſtors judgments. If ſo, thoſe Words are, no doubt, to be inverted in <hi>Heb.</hi> 15.17. So in pa. 42, about a Miniſter's promiſe before Settlement, which certainly can never be made by any that have the exerciſe of Reaſon and Conſcience; for who can with ſafety, promiſe to govern ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Platform, whenas its not unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that after a time he may find things in it that to him appear, in no wiſe to agree with the holy Oracles. In that caſe certainly that word muſt take place in Acts 5.29 <hi>We ought to obey God, rather than man</hi> Again, as to what is called the Third way of Communion: if I underſtand what is intended by it; there appears no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture warrant therefor. When ever a Church
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003838_0005_100262C867DFB3E0"/>comes to be evidently Heretical or Scandalous, there needs no Councils or Synods in that Caſe. The Churches are bound in duty, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> to deny Communion with them, according to that plain and ſolemnly expreſſed precept, in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6. without waiting for the interpoſition of any Council or Synod, what is ſaid in the Platform notwithſtanding, tho' the Compoſers of it are readily acknowleged to have been wiſe and holy Perſons. Nor do I object againſt Synods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing in a Platform, their preſent Sentiments as to the Scripture way of Church Diſcipline; yet certainly none may impoſe theſe Sentiments on the Conſciences of others as if binding to them. Indeed, ſo far as appears, hardly any one Church ever complied fully with the Platform; but varied, ſome in one thing, ſome in another, ſome in many, according (as is in Charity to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) as they apprehended the Platform to vary from the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Whatever Pleas are made for any Platform, or Synodical determination, if we be indeed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants we muſt ever appeal to the Law and Teſtimony, as in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.20 as our only Rule in the concernments of Religion. It was the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi> duty, not to take the Sermons even of the Apoſtles upon truſt, but muſt ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the Touchſtone by which to try them, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. and it is evidently ours alſo, both as to the Preaching of Miniſters, and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of Synods, Councils, <hi>&amp;c</hi> And every
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003838_0006_100262CBF8A4DEA8"/>Chriſtian muſt be allowed to make a Judgment for himſelf, whether that be Scriptural which is ſaid by others ſo to be. Nor need there be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in variety of ſentiments about the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture, while we exerciſe the Charity required in <hi>Rom</hi> 14.1 and <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12, 13.</p>
            <p>What appears in a late Print of <hi>Octob.</hi> 21. 1734. concerning a <hi>Salem</hi> Paſtor, and Councils on the Caſe, is ſurprizing. Where there is and long has been a Poſitive Charge made by no leſs than three neighbouring Paſtors, of groſs ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, as Lying, Fornication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the <hi>Pocheh</hi> Church; the Miniſters, in conformity to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian <hi>Pecheh</hi> Aſſembly, will by no means regard it. No, they ſay, they are willingly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, are at too great a diſtance. Yea, in their general Convention, have declared, that they cannot look on themſelves proper Judges; and yet contradictorily, in practice ſay the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for they judge the Caſe, and determine that Church innocent, by their communicating with them in ſpecial Ordinances, as they have opportunity. But as to other Churches (as <hi>Sandwich</hi> and <hi>Salem</hi>) where nothing of Scandal <hi>appears</hi> in the Paſtors, abundance of Pains is taken, by Councils upon Councils, to find out ſomething to faſten on them; whenas its evident that neither Councils nor Churches have any thing to do with sinful actions in Miniſters (or <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> either) unleſs they amount to Scandalous Iniquty, and that proved too, as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.15.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003838_0007_100262CE7039DB10"/>What have they to do with humane infirmities, ſince we read as in <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Ecel.</hi> 7.20. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. If ſuch Sins were publickly in an Eccleſiaſtick way to be animadverted on, there would be no time to ſpare from Church dealings and Councils animadverſions from Age to Age.</p>
            <p>It's doubtleſs evident, as the Sun at noon, that a Paſtor may certainly know of many ſinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities in ſome of the Members of his Church; yea, have abundant ground for fears and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies of ſcandalous Sin practiced by them, yet unleſs he has proof may in no wiſe publiſh them; nor then neither, unleſs thoſe feared Sins amount to what is ſcandalous; nor yet then, unleſs the Perſons can't be brought to Repentance by more private means. Much leſs may Elders be ſo dealt withal, as is evident from that ſpecial guard on their names, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19. And how inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then are Councils, harping on their fears and jealouſies of which they ſpeak in their Print, without any proof, and in direct oppoſition to that Precept in <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.16.</p>
            <p>If Scandal has been given, in the <hi>Salem</hi> caſe, (nothing of which appears) as much has been offered in the Propoſals, as any Chriſtians can Scripturally deſire. On that ſuppoſition, Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Compenſation are plumply offered. Yea, the Paſtor declares that he has ever ſtood ready therefore. Nor is there a word objected againſt the Truth of this his Declaration. And
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003838_0008_100262D045623068"/>what occaſion then for ſuch numbers of Councils of numerous Churches in them on the Caſe!</p>
            <p>Who would ever have imagined, that the meaning of thoſe words in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.22. was, that Miniſters ſhould make publick Confeſſions of their humane frailties, had not <hi>Seventeen</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches given that as the Expoſition of them! But I have done, only adding, that I verily believe that the eminently great Cauſes of theſe ſtrange wanderings in the Churches, is want of deep, ſolemn and frequent pondering on, and begging for inſight into thoſe Holy Oracles, which are appointed to be as a Lamp to our Feet, and a Light to our Paths, and accordingly to be medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated in both Day and Night; and that from hence it is that ſome are countenanced in the Miniſtry, whom the Scripture plainly forbids to meddle with it; others rightfully in it, reviled in oppoſition to plain Divine Commands; with other evils, too many to be enumerated, though greatly to be lamented.</p>
