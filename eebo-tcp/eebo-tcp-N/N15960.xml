            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Map, which the following sheets are intended to explain, comprehends almost the whole of the country, lying between the 34th and 44th degrees of lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and the 79th and 93d degrees of longitude, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes an extent of territory, of about 850 miles in length, and 700 miles in breadth; and one, which, for health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, fertility of soil, and variety of productions, is not, prehaps, surpassed by any on the habitable globe.</p>
            <p>Those parts of the country lying <hi>westward</hi> of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legheny mountain, and upon the rivers <hi>Ohio</hi> and <hi>Missisippi,</hi> and upon most of the other rivers; and the lakes (laid down in my Map) were done from my own surveys, and corrected by my own Observations of latitudes, made at different periods preceding, and during all the campaigns of the <hi>last</hi> war (in several of which I acted as an Engineer) and <hi>since</hi> in many reconnoitring tours. which I made through various parts of the country, between the years 1764 and 1775.</p>
            <p>I have compared my own Observations, and Surveys, respecting the lakes, with those made by Captain Brehm, of the 60th Regiment of Foot (who was for many years employed as an Engineer in North America) and I find, that they correspond with more exactness than Surveys usually do, which are made by different persons, at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times;—and I am happy in this opportunity, of expressing my obligations to this Gentleman, for the cheerfulness with which he furnished me with his Surveys and Remarks.</p>
            <p>It is fit also, that I should take notice, that in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which I have given of several of the <hi>branches</hi> of the Ohio, and Alleghany rivers, I have adopted the words of the late ingenious Mr. Lewis Evans, as I found he had properly described them in the Analysis to his Map of the Middle Colonies.—And as to that portion of my Map, which represents the country lying on the <hi>eastern</hi> side of the Alleghony mountain,—I take the liberty of informing my
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:020424_0004_0FAF1046B13AA170"/>
Readers, that my reason for inserting it, was to shew the several communications that are <hi>now</hi> made, and others which may be hereafter, easily, made, between the navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable branches of the <hi>Ohio</hi> and <hi>Allegheny</hi> rivers, and the rivers in <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Pennsylvania,</hi> which fall into the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic ocean, from the west and north-west.</p>

            <head>A TOPOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE lands lying on the westerdly line, between the <hi>Laurel</hi> Mountain and the <hi>Allegheny</hi> River, and thence northerly up that River for 150 miles, on both sides of the same, tho' not much broken with high mountains, are not of the same excellent quality with the lands to the southward of Fort Pitt. They consist chiefly of <hi>White Oak,</hi> and <hi>Chesnut</hi> ridges; and in many places of poor <hi>Pitch Pines,</hi> inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>persed with tracts of good land; and low mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow grounds.</p>
            <p>The lands comprehended between the River <hi>Ohio,</hi> at Fort Pitt, and the <hi>Laurel</hi> mountain, and thence continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same breadth from Fort Pitt to the Great Kan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawa River, may, according to my own observations, and those of the late Mr. Gist, of Virginia, be generally, and justly described as follows.</p>
            <p>The vallies adjoining to the branches of springs of the middle forks of <hi>Youghiogeny,</hi> are narrow towards its source, but there is a considerable quantity of good farming grounds on the hills, near the largest branch of that River. The lands within a small distance of the <hi>Laurel</hi> Mountain (through which the <hi>Youghiogeny</hi> runs) are in many places broken and stony, but <hi>rich</hi> and well timbered; and in some places, and particularly on <hi>Laurel</hi> Creek, they are rocky and mountainous.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Laurel</hi> Mountain, to <hi>Monongahela,</hi> the first seven miles are good, level farming grounds, with fine meadows; the timber, white Oak, Chesnut, Hickory, &amp;c. The same kind of land continues southerly (12 miles) to the upper branches or forks of this River, and about 15 miles notherly to the place where the <hi>Youghiogeny</hi> falls into the <hi>Monongahela</hi> —The lands, for about 18 miles in the same Course of the last mentioned River, on each side of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho' hilly, are <hi>rich</hi> and well timbered —The trees are Walnut, L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cust<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chesnut, Poplar, and Sugar or sweet Maple.—The low lands, near the River, are about a mile,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:020424_0006_0FAF104830B38398"/>
and in several places two miles wide.—For a considerable way down the River, on the eastern side of it, the intervals are extremely <hi>rich,</hi> and about a mile wide. The Upland for about 12 miles eastwardly, are uncommonly fertile, and well timbered;—the low lands, on the western side, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> narrow; but the Uplands, on the eastern side of the River, both up and down, are excellent, and covered with Sugar trees, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Such parts of the country which lie on some of the branches of the <hi>Monongabela,</hi> and across the heads of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rivers, that run into the <hi>Ohio,</hi> tho' in general hilly, are exceedingly fruitful and well watered —The timber is Walnut, Chesnut, Ash, Oak, Sugar trees, &amp;c.—and the interval or meadow lands are from 250 yards to a quarter of a mile wide.</p>
            <p>The lands lying nearly in a <hi>north-westerdly direction</hi> from the <hi>Great Kanbawa River</hi> to the <hi>Ohio,</hi> and thence north-easterdly, and also upon <hi>Le Tort</hi>'s Creek, <hi>Little Kanhawa River, Buffaloe, Fishing, Weeling,</hi> and <hi>the two upper</hi> and <hi>two lower,</hi> and several other very considerable <hi>Creeks</hi> (or what, in Europe would be called large Rivers,) and thence east, and south east to the <hi>River Monongabela,</hi> are, in point of quality, as follows.</p>
            <p>The borders or meadow lands, are a mile, and in some places near two miles wide; and the Uplands are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of a most fertil soil, capable of abundantly producing <hi>Wheat, Hemp, F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The lands which lie upon the <hi>Ohio,</hi> at the mouths of, and between the above <hi>Creeks,</hi> also consist of rich intervals and very fine farming grounds.—The whole country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in <hi>Bears, Elks, Buffaloe, Deer, Turkies,</hi> &amp;c.—An unquestionable proof of the extraordinary goodness of its soil! <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>The Navigation of the <hi>Ohio</hi> in a dry season, is rather troublesome <hi>from Fort Pitt to the Mingo town,</hi> (about seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five miles) but from <hi>thence to the Missisippi,</hi> there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a sufficient depth of water for barges, carrying from 100 to 200 tons burthen, built in the manner as those are which are used on the River <hi>Thames,</hi> between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Oxford</hi>;—to wit, from 100 to 120 feet in keel, sixteen to eighteen feet in breadth, and four feet in depth, and when loaded, drawing about three feet water.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rapids</hi> in a <hi>dry</hi> season, are difficult to descend with <hi>loaded</hi> boats or b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In a <hi>dry</hi> season, the descent of the Rapids, in the distance of a mile, is about 12, or 15 feet, and the passage <hi>down,</hi> would not be difficult, except, prehaps, for the following reasons. Two miles above them, the River is deep, and three quarters of a mile broad;—but the <hi>channel</hi> is much contracted, and does not exceed 250 yards in breadth; (near three-fourths of the bed of the River, on the south eastern side of it—being filled with a flat Limestone rock, so that in a dry season, there is seldom more than 6 or 8 inches water) it is upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

being confined, as above mentioned; the descending wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters tumble over the <hi>Rapids</hi> with a considerable degree of celerity and force. The channel is of different depths, but no where, I think, less than 5 feet;—It is clear, and upon each side of it are large broken rocks, a few inches under water<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Colonel GORDON, in his Journal <hi>down</hi> the Ohio mentions,
<q>that these Falls do not deserve that Name as the Stream on the north side, has no sudden pitch, but only runs rapid over the ledge of a flat rock;—several boats, he says, passed it in the <hi>dryest season of the year</hi>; unloading one third of their freight. They passed on the north side, where the carrying-place is three quarters of a mile long. On the south-east side, it is about half that distance, and is reckoned the safest passage for those, who are unacquainted with it, but it is the most tedious, as during part of the summer, and Fall, the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomen drag their boats over the flat rock. The Fall is about half a mile rapid water, which however is passible, by wading and draging the boat against the stream, <hi>when lowest,</hi> and with still greater ease, when the water is raised a little.</q>—</p>

The <hi>Rapids</hi> are nearly in Latitude 38 8;—and the only Indian village (1766) on the banks of the <hi>Ohio</hi> River between them and <hi>Fort Pitt,</hi> was on the north-west side, 75 miles below <hi>Pittsburgh,</hi> called the <hi>Mingo</hi> town; it contained 60 families.</p>
            <p>Most of the Hills on both sides of the <hi>Ohio</hi> are filled with excellent coal, and a coal mine was in the year 1760 open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed opposite to <hi>Fort Pitt</hi> on the River <hi>Monongahela,</hi> for the use of that Garrison. <hi>Salt springs,</hi> as well as <hi>Iron Ore,</hi> and rich <hi>Lead Mines,</hi> are found bordering upon the River <hi>Ohio.</hi> One of the latter, is opened upon a branch of the <hi>Sioto,</hi> River, and there, the <hi>Indian</hi> natives supply themselves with a considerable part of the lead, which they use in their wars, and hunting.</p>
            <p>About 584 miles below <hi>Fort Pitt,</hi> and on the eastern side of the <hi>Ohio</hi> River, about three miles from it, at the head of a small Creek or Run, where are several large and miry Salt Springs, are found numbers of large bones, teeth and tusk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly fertile, and in its natural state, yields Hemp, Pea-Vines, Grass, &amp;c. and a great variety of trees, and in particular, the Aspen Tree of an unusual height and thickness.</p>
            <p>For 25 miles up the <hi>Missisippi</hi> (from the <hi>Ohio</hi>) the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is rich, level and well timbered;—and then several gentle rising grounds appear, which gradually diminish at the distance of between four or five miles eastward from the River.

The country is a mixture of hills and vallies; some of the former are rocky and steep;—but they, as well as the vallies, are shaded with fine Oaks, Hickory, Walnut, Ash and Mulberry trees, &amp;c. Some of the high grounds afford the most pleasant situations for settlements. Their elevated, and airy positions, together with the great luxuriance of the Soil, every where yielding plenty of Grass, and useful plants, promise health, and ample re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to industrious settlers.</p>

            <p>August 1, about 12 o'clock, we stopped at the <hi>Piorias</hi> wintering ground. About a quarter of a mile from the River, on the eastern side of it, is a meadow of many miles long, and five or six miles broad. In this meadow are many small lakes, communicating with each other, and by which there are passages for small boats or canoes and one in particular, leads to the <hi>Illinois</hi> River.

            <p>August 5, It rained all day, which detained us till the evening, when we embarked, and rowed till dark; in our way we passed the Lake <hi>Demi-Quian,</hi> 200 yards west from the river of that name, it is a circular figure, six miles across, and discharges itself by a small passage, four feet deep into the <hi>Illinois</hi> River. This Lake is 171 miles from the <hi>Missisippi.</hi> The general course of the <hi>Illinois River</hi> varies very little; it rather however inclines to the eastward. The lands are much the same as before described, only the <hi>Prairies</hi> (Meadows) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend further from the river by our reckoning, we are 177 miles from the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

About four o'clock we passed the river <hi>De la March,</hi> (on the western side also of the <hi>Illinois</hi> river;) it is 30 yards wide, and navigable about eight or nine miles only. Though the <hi>De la March</hi> is not so long as the <hi>Seseme Quian,</hi> yet it is much hansomer. These rivers are about nine miles distant from each other. Here the land begins to rise gradually on the western bank. At sun set we passed a river called <hi>Michilimackinac.</hi> It is on the south-eastern side of the <hi>Illinois</hi> River; is 50 yards wide, navigable for about 90 miles, and has betw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>August 7, The morning being very foggy, and the River overgrown with weeds along its sides, we could make but little way. About 12 o'clock we got to the old <hi>Pioria Fort</hi> and village on the western shore of the Riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and at the southern end of the lake called the <hi>Illinois Lake</hi>; which is 19 miles and a half in length, and three miles in breadth. It has no Rocks, Shoals or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Current. We found the stockades of this <hi>Pioria Fort</hi> destroyed by fire, but the houses standing. The summit on which the Fort stood, commands a fine prospect of the country to the eastward, and up the lake to the point, where the River comes in at the north end; to the westward are large meadows. In the lake is great plenty of fish, and in particular, <hi>Sturgeon,</hi> and <hi>Picannau.</hi> On the eastern side of the lake, about the middle of it, the chain of Rocks, that extends from the back of <hi>Kaskaskias,</hi> to <hi>Cahokia Piasa,</hi> the mouth of the <hi>Illinois</hi> River, &amp;c. terminates. The Country to the westward, is low and very level, covered with Grass, Weeds, Flags, &amp;c. Here is abundance of Cherry, P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>August 8, The wind being fair we made a sail of our tent, and reached the upper end of the lake by sun set; and the wind continuing fair we ascended the River, and about 4 o'clock passed <hi>Crows Meadows River,</hi> which comes from the eastward, and over against it, on the west side, are the meadows just mentioned, 240 miles from the <hi>Missisippi.</hi> This River is twenty yards wide, and navigable between 15 and 18 miles. The land on both sides of the <hi>Illinois</hi> River, for 27 or 30 miles above the lake, is generally low and full of Swamps, some a mile wide, bordered with fine meadows, and in some places, the high land comes to the River in points, or narrow necks.</p>

After passing this River, which is 255 miles from the <hi>Missisippi,</hi> we found the water very shallow, and it was with difficulty that we got forward, though we employed seven oars, and our boat drew only three feet water.

            <p>August 10, We crossed the high land, at ten o'clock we came to the <hi>Fox River</hi> (or a branch of it) after walking twenty-four miles. It falls into the <hi>Illinois</hi> River, thirty miles beyond the place where we left our boat. The <hi>Fox</hi> River is 25 yards wide, and has about five feet water; its course is from the westward by many windings through large meadows. At three miles dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, after crossing this river, we fell in with the <hi>Illinois</hi> River again, and kept along its bank; here we found a path. About six o'clock we arrived, after walking about 12 miles, at an old encampment, fifteen miles from the <hi>Fork.</hi> The land is stoney, and the meadows not so good as some which we formerly passed;—from hence we went to an island, where several <hi>French</hi> traders were e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

August 11, We set off about three o'clock, and at night got within nine miles of our boat. We computed it to be 45 miles from the island we last departed from, to the place where we left our boat.</p>
            <p>August 12, We embarked early, and proceeded three miles down the <hi>Illinois</hi> River.
