            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY on <hi>COMETS.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>'TIS an admirable Work of our GOD, that the many <hi>Globes</hi> in the Univerſe are placed at ſuch Diſtances, as to avoid all violent Shocks upon one another, and every thing wherein they might prove a prejudice to one another.</p>
            <p>Even <hi>Comets</hi> too, move ſo as to ſerve the Holy Ends of their Creator! COMETS, which are commonly called <hi>Blazing Stars,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto later Obſervations to be a ſort of <hi>Excentrical Planets,</hi> that move periodically about the <hi>Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> from whom 'tis a difficult thing to diſſent in any thing that belongs to <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> concludes, that the Bodies of <hi>Comets</hi> are ſolid compact, fixed, and durable even like thoſe of the other <hi>Planets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He has a very critical Thought upon the <hi>Heat,</hi> which theſe <hi>Bodies</hi> may ſuffer in their Tranſits near the <hi>Sun.</hi> A famous one, in the Year 1680, paſſed ſo near the <hi>Sun,</hi> that the <hi>Heat</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> in it muſt be twenty-eight thouſand time as intenſe as it is in <hi>England</hi> at Midſummer; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Heat of boiling Water, as he tried, is but little more than the dry Earth of that Iſland, expoſed unto the Midſummer-Sun: and the <hi>Heat</hi> of <hi>red-hot Iron</hi> he takes to be three or four times as great as that of <hi>boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Heat</hi> of that <hi>Comet</hi> in its <hi>Perihelion</hi> was near two thouſand times as great as that of <hi>red-hot Iron.</hi> If it had been an Aggregate of nothing but Exhalations, the <hi>Sun</hi> would have render'd it inviſible. A Globe of <hi>red-hot Iron,</hi> of the Dimenſions of our Earth, would ſcarce be cool, by his Computation, in <hi>Fifty Thouſand Years.</hi> If then this <hi>Comet</hi> cooled an hundred times as faſt as <hi>red-hot Iron,</hi> yet, ſince his Heat was <hi>Two Thouſand</hi> times greater than that of <hi>red-hot Iron,</hi> if you ſuppoſe his Body no greater than that of this Earth, he will not be cool in a Million of Years.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:005389_0003_10182BE868A65B58"/>
The <hi>Tails</hi> of <hi>Comets,</hi> which are longeſt and largeſt juſt after their <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rihelions,</hi> he takes to be a long and very thin Smoke, or a mighty Train of Vapours, which the ignited <hi>Nucleus,</hi> or the Head of the <hi>Comet,</hi> emits from it. And he eaſily and thoroughly confounds the ſilly Notion of their being only the <hi>Beams of the Sun,</hi> ſhining thro' the Head of the <hi>Star.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Phaenomena of the <hi>Tails of Comets</hi> depend upon the Motion of their <hi>Heads,</hi> and have their Matter ſupplied from thence.</p>
            <p>There may ariſe from the Atmoſphere of <hi>Comets,</hi> Vapours enough to take up ſuch immenſe Spaces as we ſee they do. Computations made of and from the Rarity of our <hi>Air,</hi> which by and by iſſue in Aſtoniſhments, will render this Matter evident.</p>
            <p>That the Tails of <hi>Comets</hi> are extremely rare, is apparent from this; the <hi>Fixed Stars</hi> appearing ſo plainly thro' them.</p>
            <p>The Atmoſphere of <hi>Comets,</hi> as they deſcend towards the <hi>Sun,</hi> is very ſenſibly diminiſhed by their vaſt running out, that they may afford Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to produce the <hi>Blaze. Hevelius</hi> has obſerved, that their Atmoſphere is enlarged, when they do not ſo much run out into <hi>Tail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> has an Apprehenſion, which is a little ſurprizing, That thoſe Vapours which are dilated, and go off in the <hi>Blazes</hi> of <hi>Comets,</hi> and are diffuſed thro' all the Celeſtial Regions, may by little and little, by their own proper <hi>Gravity,</hi> be attracted into the <hi>Planets,</hi> and become intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with their Atmoſpheres. As to the Conſtitution of ſuch an <hi>Earth</hi> as ours, it is neceſſary there ſhould be <hi>Seas;</hi> thus, for the Conſervation of the <hi>Seas,</hi> and Moiſture of the Planets, there may be a neceſſity of <hi>Comets,</hi> from whoſe condenſed Vapours, all that <hi>Moiſture,</hi> which is conſumed in Vegetations and Putrefactions, and ſo turned into dry Earth, may by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees be continually ſupplied, repaired, and recruited. Yea, he has a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, that the Spirit, which is the fineſt, the moſt ſubtle, and the very beſt part of our <hi>Air,</hi> and which is neceſſarily requiſite unto the Life and Being of all Things, comes chiefly from <hi>Comets.</hi> If this be ſo, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of <hi>Comets</hi> is not ſo dreadful a thing, as the <hi>Cometomantia,</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally prevailing, has repreſented it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Caſſini</hi> will thus far allow bad Preſages to <hi>Comets,</hi> That if the Tail of a <hi>Comet</hi> ſhould be too much intermingled with our <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> or if the Matter of it ſhould, by its <hi>Gravity,</hi> fall down upon the Earth; it may induce thoſe Changes in in our <hi>Air,</hi> whereof we ſhould be very ſenſible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bernoulli,</hi> in his <hi>Syſtema Cometarum,</hi> ſuppoſes, That there is a <hi>Primary Planet,</hi> revolving round the <hi>Sun</hi> in the ſpace of four Years and 157 Days; and at the Diſtance of 2,583 Semidiameters of the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis Magnus.</hi> This <hi>Primary Planet,</hi> he ſuppoſes, either from his mighty
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005389_0004_10182BEAF0AAFC00"/>
               <hi>Diſtance,</hi> or his minute <hi>Smallneſs,</hi> to be not viſible unto us; to have ſeveral <hi>Satellits</hi> moving round him, tho' none deſcending ſo low as the Orbit of <hi>Saturn;</hi> and that theſe becoming viſible to us, when in their <hi>Perigaeon,</hi> are what we call <hi>Comets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Prediction, That a Time ſhould come, when our Myſteries of <hi>Comets</hi> ſhould be unfolded, ſeems almoſt accompliſhed. However <hi>Seneca</hi> has not obliged us with the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> obſerved by him, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged this Prediction.</p>
            <p>No Hiſtories of <hi>Comets</hi> were of ſervice to the Theory of them, until <hi>Nicephoras Gregoras,</hi> a <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Aſtronomer, deſcribed the Path of a Comet in 1337.</p>
            <p>All that conſidered <hi>Comets</hi> until <hi>Tycho Brabe,</hi> conſider'd them as no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Vapours below the <hi>Moon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anon, the ſagacious <hi>Kepler</hi> improving on <hi>Tycho</hi>'s Diſcoveries, came at a true Syſtem of <hi>Comets,</hi> and found, that they moved freely through the Planetary Orbs, with a Motion that is not much different from a <hi>Rectilinear</hi> one.</p>
            <p>The incomparable <hi>Hevelius</hi> went on, and tho' he embraced the <hi>Keplerian</hi> Hypotheſis, of the <hi>Rectilinear Motion of Comets,</hi> yet he was aware, <hi>That the Path of a Comet was bent into a curve Line towards the Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At laſt the illuſtrious Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> arrives with Demonſtrations, That all the Phaenomena of <hi>Comets</hi> would naturally follow from the <hi>Keplerian</hi> Principles. He ſhewed a Method of delineating the <hi>Orbits</hi> of <hi>Comets</hi> geometrically; which cauſed Admiration in all that conſidered it, and comprehended it.</p>
            <p>The moſt ingenious Dr. <hi>Halley</hi> has made Calculations, upon which he ventures to foretell the <hi>Return</hi> of <hi>Comets;</hi> but he obſerves, that ſome of them have their <hi>Nodes</hi> pretty near the annual Orb of the Earth. I will tranſcribe the Words he concludes with: 'What may be the <hi>Conſequences</hi> of ſo near an <hi>Appulſe,</hi> or of a <hi>Contact,</hi> or laſtly of a <hi>Shock</hi> of the Celeſtial Bodies, (which is by no means impoſſible to come to paſs) I leave to be diſcuſſed by the Studious of Phyſical Matters.'</p>
            <p>The Sentiments of ſo acute a Philoſopher as Dr. <hi>Cheyne</hi> upon <hi>Comets,</hi> deſerve to be tranſcribed. Says he,</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Species</hi> of Heavenly Bodies, call'd COMETS, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve about the <hi>Sun;</hi> in very Oblong <hi>Elliptick Orbits,</hi> approaching to <hi>Parabolick Curves.</hi> The Times of their <hi>Periodical</hi> Revolutions are very long, ſince in three or four Thouſand Years, we have not poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd the Returns of above one or two; however, its certain, that like our <hi>Planets,</hi> they do move in a recurring <hi>Orbit,</hi> that the <hi>Sun</hi> is in one of the <hi>Foci</hi> of this <hi>Orbit,</hi> that by a Ray from the <hi>Sun,</hi> they deſcribe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005389_0005_10180F5B62D63298"/>
               <hi>Area</hi>'s in equal Times, that the ſame <hi>Law of Gravitation</hi> obtains in them, which does in the <hi>Planets;</hi> that their <hi>Peroidical</hi> Times are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and invariable, and that their Motions are regular, only their Courſe in their <hi>Orbits</hi> is not determin'd one way, but in differently ſome of 'em move one way, others another: They are alſo about the ſame Bulk with the <hi>Planets,</hi> generally ſpeaking; and like them are compact ſolid Bodies, but ſurrounded with a vaſtly large thin Fluid, intermixt with ſeveral groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Particles, and compoſing an irregular unequally diſpos'd and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly agitated Maſs; which is call'd its <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> whoſe <hi>Diameter,</hi> is ten or fifteen Times as long as that of its Body. Beſides which, it has a long lucid <hi>Train,</hi> which is rais'd in its Approach to the <hi>Sun,</hi> by the Heat thereof, and extends ſometimes to four hundred Thouſand Miles above its Body. It is always oppoſite to the <hi>Sun,</hi> becauſe it is the thiner part of its <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> extremely rarified by his Rays; and ſo rare that the <hi>Stars</hi> may be ſeen through it. This <hi>Tail</hi> accompanies it through its Courſe overall the <hi>Planetary Regions,</hi> encreaſing in its Approach to the <hi>Sun,</hi> and leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its Receſs. Theſe <hi>Comets</hi> ſometimes come ſo near the <hi>Sun,</hi> as to be heated to ſuch a Degree that they cannot become cool again, in many Thouſands of Years. This with its violent Motion in a <hi>Curve,</hi> which comes near to a ſtreight Line, after it has paſs'd its <hi>Perihelium,</hi> and the irregular Diſpoſition of the confus'd Maſs of its <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> makes it an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit Habitation for Animals, that are not in a State of Puniſhment, ſo far as we can conceive of the Nature of Animals. And therefore ſome have tho't it deſign'd, to ſupply the Expence of Fluids in the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Planets.</hi> But as I have before hinted, this does not ſeem ſo very probable, becauſe Nature always ſupplies conſtant and regular Expences after a conſtant and regular Manner. Now the Returns of theſe Bodies are ſo irregular and uncertain, and we ſo little feel the Effects of theſe Returns (which of Neceſſity muſt be felt, if theſe frightful Bodies made the <hi>Reimburſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> mentioned, ſince the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Planets</hi> as recruited all at once, or in a very ſhort time, of all the loſs they have ſuffer'd in their Fluids for many Years before,) that I am afraid no ſuch benign Influences, are to be expected from them. I readily grant, that there may be ſome Clouds of Vapours ſweep'd off the <hi>Tails</hi> of theſe <hi>Comets,</hi> by the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Planets</hi> as they approach them. But then it is uncertain of what Nature theſe Vapours are, for every Vapour will not become a Fluid, unleſs its Parts be of ſuch a determin'd <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Size</hi> as the Nature of Fluids require. Now it's certain, that Heat will raiſe any Body into a Vapour, provided it be ſufficient to diſſolve the Union of its Parts, and increaſe their Bulk to a neceſſary Dimenſion: Moreover its hardly accountable how the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhou'd draw from thence only the Fluid of Light, the Earth, that of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005389_0006_10182BF02CB947A0"/>the other <hi>Planets</hi> their proper Fluids; or if they were ſuppos'd to draw all <hi>promiſcuouſly,</hi> how theſe Effects can anſwer the Deſign, ſince Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the <hi>Sun,</hi> which wanted only more of the Fluid of Light, wou'd be as improper a Gueſt, as Fire on the Earth which wanted only more Water. I think it is more probable, that theſe frightful Bodies are the Miniſters of <hi>Divine Juſtice,</hi> and in their Viſits, lend us <hi>Benign</hi> or <hi>Noxious</hi> Vapours, according to the Deſigns of Providence: that they may have brought, and may ſtill bring about, the great <hi>Cataſtrophes</hi> of our <hi>Syſtem,</hi> by raiſing of <hi>Tides,</hi> changing the Figures, and the Poſitions of the <hi>Planets,</hi> and the very Nature of the <hi>Orbits</hi> themſelves: and that they may be the Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Animals</hi> in a ſtate of Puniſhment; which, if it did not look too <hi>national,</hi> there are many Arguments to render not improbable. But as for the Diminution of the Quantity of Fluids in the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Planets,</hi> it is certainly ſo ſmall and ſo inconſiderable (tho' ſtill it be ſometing) that it will never be ſenſible in any finite Number of Years, and ſo needs not ſo magnificent of Light, I do believe it may be demonſtrated, that if all the Fluid which the <hi>Sun</hi> loſes in a Year were brought into a ſolid Form, it would not equal a Grain of Sand. Now what is that to the vaſt Body of the <hi>Sun?</hi> And as for the Fluids on <hi>our Globe,</hi> tho' ſome of them be reduc'd into a ſolid Form, yet upon Examination it will be found that moſt of the ſame is again diſſolv'd into a Fluid; for in all <hi>Animals</hi> and <hi>Vegetables,</hi> the Matter is plain; and as for <hi>Minerals</hi> and <hi>Metals,</hi> I doubt much, whether there be very many new Productions or Generations of that kind, ſince their firſt Production. So that though there be ſome loſs of Fluids on <hi>our Globe,</hi> yet there is ſtore enough to ſupply all the Uſes of Life and Vegetation, for any finite number of Years; and by the Frame, and Make of this our <hi>Syſtem,</hi> it does not ſeem deſign'd to laſt for ever, without ſome conſiderable Changes.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Comets,</hi> I have little more to ſay about them, than what I have already ſaid, their <hi>Nature, Orbits, Motions</hi> and <hi>Situations,</hi> have been ſo lately determin'd, (indeed it is but of late, that the <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> of the <hi>Planets</hi> themſelves, and their <hi>Satellits</hi> has been brought to any toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Perfection, and much later ſince final Cauſes have been cultivated, with that Care becoming ſo noble and about 'em extant, ſo few of 'em, that we know of, have viſited us twice, that we have ſcarce any ſolid Foundation to build our Reaſoning upon. Only, as I have before hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, theſe <hi>blazing Stars</hi> ſeem not deſign'd for the Habitation of <hi>Animals</hi> in a State of Happineſs, nay even ſcarce of <hi>Animals</hi> not under a State of Puniſhment; they may be the firſt <hi>Rudiments of Planets,</hi> not as
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005389_0007_10182BF33A9FA8F0"/>yet brought into our <hi>Syſtem,</hi> or rather the <hi>Ruins</hi> of ſome baniſh'd thence, to wander in theſe long <hi>Eccentrick Orbits,</hi> through the World. But moſt likely they are the <hi>Miniſters of Divine Juſtice,</hi> ſending baneful Steams, from their long Trains, upon the <hi>Planets,</hi> they come nigh; and if what is commonly ſaid of 'em by <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> be true, they ſeldom viſit us without ſome ſuch direful Salutation. However, from them we may learn that the <hi>Divine Vengeance,</hi> may find a Seat for the Puniſhment of his diſobedient Creatures, without being put to the Expenſe of a new Creation.'</p>
            <p>When I ſee a vaſt Comet, blazing and rolling about the unmeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Aether,</hi> I will think;</p>
            <p>'Who can tell, but I now ſee a wicked World <hi>made a fiery Oven in the Time of the Anger of GOD! The Lord ſwallowing them up in his Wrath and the Fire devouring them!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What prodigious Miſchief and Ruin might ſuch a <hi>Ball of Confuſion</hi> bring upon our ſinful <hi>Globe,</hi> if the Great GOD order its Approach unto us.</p>
            <p>How happy they, that are in the Favour and Friendſhip of that Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord, who <hi>knows how to deliver the Pious</hi> out of Diſtreſſes, and <hi>reſerve the Unjuſt for a Puniſhment of a Day of Judgment.</hi>
