            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE following calculations are formed on a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that on an average, people do not become incapable of ſupporting themſelves, until they are 60 years of age—that of 10 negroes ſet free at 21 years of age, 6 of them die before they exceed their 60th year—that the remaining 4 live to the age of 72 years—that only one fourth part of theſe ſurvivors ever become a publick charge—and that for the laſt 12 years, the ſum of £.10 per annum will be ſufficient for his or her maintenance.</p>
            <p>THAT we may be much within bounds, we have allowed that more than <hi>nine</hi> Negroes out of the <hi>ſeventy</hi> may become chargeable, though among the whites we find that not <hi>one</hi> in <hi>fifty</hi> of thoſse who depend on their labour for ſubſiſtence, are ſupported by the publick.</p>

            <p>N. B. The calculations are all formed on tables, made from the Breſlau bills of mortality, by the very ingenious and judicious Dr. Edmund Halley, which are in ſuch repute, as to be univerſally uſed in valuing annuities on lives, and all other purpoſes of that nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, to which they are adapted. For inſtance, it is found by thoſe bills, that of 592 perſons of the age of 21 years, only 242 perſons were living 39 years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, viz. at the age of 60 years. Thus for our preſent purpoſe we ſay, if 592 perſons aged 21 years, only leave 242 perſon alive at the age of 60 years; how many will 10 perſons of the age of 21 years, leave alive at 60 years of age? The anſwer is 4, agreeable to our calculations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:042395_0006_101B611DB389D900"/>THIS account is ſtated with as much accuracy as was poſſible, without introducing fractions, which would have multiplied figures to little purpoſe. When they did occur in the tables, the neareſt whole number was uſed, and as that method is ſtrictly observed, both in the debits and credits, it is preſumed any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuracy ariſing from it, muſt be immaterial.</p>
            <p>IF 10s. is paid to the overſeers of the poor, on the manumiſſion, for every year the ſlave hath exceeded 21, it is found that, although there is allowed for the maintenance of every one becoming chargeable, <hi>four</hi> times as much as the Pennſylvania law requires, there ſtill remains in favour of the publick, a balance of £.150, excluſive of £.431 15s. which is the amount of the taxes that would be paid by them, before they attained the age of 60 years: after which age, it is allowed, that thoſe who come to want aſſiſtance ſhould be <hi>whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> maintained, when probably they might want but <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> aſſiſtance for ſome years afterwards.—In the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the taxes no account is made of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of ſeveral of them acquiring ſuch eſtates, or following ſuch trades, as would be ſubject to much higher taxes; but every one of them is reckoned among the very <hi>loweſt</hi> of the taxables.— In calculating the intereſt on the depoſit money, it is carried to 66 years ; becauſe the expence of a maintenance begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at 60, and ending at 72, brings it on an average to 66. It may be obſerved that the intereſt carried to the credit of the account, might with great juſtice be much increaſed: For inſtance, 40 years intereſt on £.25, only amounts to £.60, (as ſtated in the account) whereas it is highly reaſonable, that when £.25 has doubled itſelf, which it will do in 16 years and 2 thirds of a year, at 6 per cent per annum, the intereſt on the doubled ſum, to wit, £.50, should thereafter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence as on a principal ſum, which will again be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:042395_0007_101BD8F4DF3EFA48"/>
in 16 years and 2 thirds of a year, and then amount to £.100, on which intereſt again reckoned for 6 years and 2 thirds of a year longer (being in the whole 40 years) is £.40 more or £.140 total; which ſum may be juſtly carried to the credit of the account, inſtead of the £85, which <hi>is</hi> carried out. For this reaſon no leſs than the ſum of £.255 ſhould be yet added to the balance as ſtated. Had the calculation been made on an allowance of <hi>compound</hi> intereſt, in which money (at the ſame rate) doubles itſelf in leſs than 12 years, the balance would have been ſtill much increaſed; but <hi>that</hi> method is rejected, as what many might diſapprove, although from what follows, it will appear, that monies put out on intereſt in the common way, cannot with near ſo much propriety, be entitled to <hi>compound</hi> inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, as in this inſtance, where the money is in conſtant circulation. Now, that all the monies depoſited on manumiſſion will be ſecure and <hi>conſtantly</hi> in uſe, and therefore entitled to intereſt, is evident when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that the ſums ſo depoſited, are paid for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate uſe of the poor: For, if £.25 be paid on the manumiſſion of 10 negroes, age 26 years, in any townſhip, ſo much leſs than the uſual <hi>poor tax,</hi> will be collected from the inhabitants of that townſhip; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore each <hi>taxable</hi> retains in his own hands <hi>his</hi> proportionable part of the ſaid £.25, and ſo will continue to do, in all probability, for 34 years; at which period it is ſuppoſed, <hi>one</hi> of the negroes may firſt require aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and <hi>then</hi> every inhabitant firſt pays a proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of his ſhare of the ſaid £.25 left or retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his hands 34 years, as above-mentioned; and as money is univerſally allowed to be worth its intereſt in whatever hands it may be, it muſt be ſuppoſed he has made ſuch uſe of it, as may well enable him to pay the whole ſum with its intereſt, when it may be called for to furniſh the neceſſary aſſiſtance to one of theſe <hi>Paupers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:042395_0008_101BD8F661B71E68"/>On the whole—it appears by the account as ſtated, that the publick <hi>receives</hi> £.581 15s. more than it <hi>pays,</hi> for 70 negroes manumitted; and that if we admit a more equitable way of reckoning the intereſt, we muſt add to that balance £.255 more, which would make it £.836 15s.</p>
            <p>THEN to ſhew what the annual ſum, to ſecure the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick on a manumiſſion after the age of 21 years, ſhould be we ſay, if the depoſit money is fixed at 10s. per annum , it leaves the balance of £581 150</p>
            <p>BUT allowing the intereſt to form a <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſum</hi> after 16 years and 2 thirds of a year, the balance is £.836 150</p>
            <p>THEN in the firſt caſe, the depoſit money may be reduced to 5ſ 4½ per annum.</p>
            <p>IN the laſt caſe to 4ſ 5¼ per annum.</p>
            <p>OTHERWISE, in the firſt caſe each negro will pay £.8 6 2½ more than</p>
            <p>IN the laſt £.11 190¼ more than</p>
            <p>is neceſſary to ſecure the publick from their ever becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burdenſome.</p>
            <p>IF either the premiſes here ſaid down, or the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences made therefrom, ſhould be found wrong, it would be eſteemed a ſervice done to the cauſe of Liberty, to have the errors pointed out in one of the publick papers; for thought an indulge is wiſhed to be granted to ſuch as are conſcientiouſly ſcrupulous of holding their fellow-creatures in perpetual bondage; it is reaſonable that the publick, at the ſame time, ſhould be cautiously guarded againſt any injurious conſequences.</p>
