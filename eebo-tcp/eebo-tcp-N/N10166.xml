            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>WHEREAS I am now under ſentence of death in the City-Hall of Albany, for having as it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, counterfeited the currency of this province; and having ſcrutinized my conſcience, which beareth witneſs to the truth of what I ſhall now deliver, of my own free will, which I hope will be publiſhed according to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
               <p>If I were to write the whole of my tranſactions they would fill a large volume; but in this my journal, I only mean to give a conciſe and tree narrative of my proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>I was born in Connecticut, at a place called Groton, near New-London, in the Year 1720. My parents were reputable people, who, both by example and precept endeavoured to inculcate principles of virtue and honor in me. From my youth I have been an admirer of the operations of nature, and never deſiſted from enquiring

info any thing that I thought an arcanum until I had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſome idea of it, my thirſt after knowledge being inſatiable.</p>
               <p>When I arrived at the twenty ſecond year of my age, my inclination prompted me to viſit the ſouthern colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, I traveled into Virginia, where I reſided near ſixteen years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The principal part of my buſineſs was curing cancers; of this art I may juſtly call myſelf maſter, as I have cured every ſpecies of them except the ſanguine cancer, and even that ſome times when the blood was not too much infected. I underſtand the ſeperation of metals, and was often called upon to examine minerals. In Virginia, Colonel Cheſwell, who had lead mines, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed me to work upon lead and copper ore: He died, and Colonel James Bird, who became ſole owner of the mines, declined having them worked. From theſe works, which are ſituate at a place called New-River, near the line which divides North Carolina from Virginia, I went to Dan River, which I croſſed and came to a place called Saliſbury, in Roan county, North Carolina. After ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few days there I ſteered my courſe to Meclinburgh, which lies upon the Calava River. This ſeemed to be a good place for my buſineſs; and, as the county was young and the court houſe then building. I reſolved to make that the place of my reſidence.</p>
               <p>HAVING agreed for my board and lodging, and being informed that ſeveral perſons in the nieghbourhood were afflicted with cancers, I publiſhed an advertiſement, the purport of which was, that I would undertake to cure them, and if I did not ſucceed, no money ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. This had the deſired effect, for in a few days I had ſeveral patients.</p>

her noſe; the next was one James Mac, he had been diſtreſſed with a cancer for upwards of twenty two years, and was, indeed, a miſerable ſpectacle to look upon; three months elapſed before I could cure him. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear relating an incident that happened to this man while he was my patient: After I cauſed the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer to fall out, and he place nearly healed, a cow broke into his corn-field which put him in a violent paſſion; he loaded a piſtol almoſt full with powder and ſalt, went into the field to frighten the cow, and ſnapped the piſtol ſeveral times, but it miſſing fire, he held it careleſsly in his hand; however, ſome ſparks having remained in the pan, it went off at a time when he did not expect it; the cock flew up, cut his under lip two thirds off, ſtruck through his noſe, and broke up the cancer: I was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſew his lip and heal that wound, which required nearly as much time as the cancer had done. This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in Tryon County, near Broad River, that falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Santee on the ſouth border of North Carolina.</p>
               <p>IN that country I became acquainted with ſeveral gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who deſired me to make their houſes my home, when I came near them; they declared it ſhould not coſt me any money if I would tarry with them all that winter.—I accepted their kind invitation; and, as I underſtand watch work, I conſtantly employed myſelf at that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, unleſs when called abroad.</p>
               <p>IN that ſituation I remained ſeveral years, but having a ſtrong deſire to viſit my brethren in New-England, I made application to my patients, and got in part of the money they owed to me; thoſe who could not pay I did not diſtreſs, nor would I accept of any reward from thoſe perſons who required my help and were in low cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, being always apprehenſive that if I accepted a fee it might diſenable them to provide neceſſaries for their children; nor did I turn away poor people who appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me for help but conſtantly exerted my abilities for their relief.</p>
               <p>

WHILE I remained in North Carolina, at the houſe of a gentleman who was a Juſtice of the peace, there came a poor woman driving a cow before her; my landlord enquiring where ſhe was driving the cow, ſhe anſwered, to the doctor, that it was the laſt ſhe had, and that her children muſt now be deprived of milk. I aſked what was her diſorder; ſhe replied a cancer in her noſe; I deſired to ſee it, and to know how long ſhe had been in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's hands; ſhe ſaid (to the beſt of my remembrance) a year or a year and a half. My landlord informed me that ſhe was a poor widow who lived about four miles diſtant from his houſe; that her name was Clark, and that ſhe had a great many poor naked children. My heart then felt a melting charity for the diſtreſſed widow:—I told her, that with the aſſiſtance of God, I would cure her, and deſired her call upon me when ſhe returned from the doctor. She complied, and I applied my medicine, and told her, that by the time ſhe got home the cancer would drop out, which accordingly happened, and in leſs than three weeks ſhe was perfectly cured. The poor creature was willing to give me all ſhe had in the world, but I would accept of nothing; for God gave me the cure, not to oppreſs widows, or make fatherleſs children cry for bread, but to releive the afflicted; and this duty correſponds with my natural diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>IN the month of September, 1770, I began my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into from North-Carolina, to New-England. No remarkable event happened in my travels until I came to Wyoming, on Suſquehanna, where I found ſeveral of my relations, but we did not know each other till I told them my name; then they remembered that they had heard their fathers ſpeak of me. Upon the road to Wyoming, I had obtained intelligence that a company of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanians were coming to drive off the ſettlers there; and, as I always was a lover of my countrymen, I warned them of the approaching danger.</p>
               <p>AT Wyoming I continued with my relations four days,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012915_0005_0F8E6E0285A177A0"/>
and then proceeded on my journey to Delaware River; there I was informed that Captain Ogden and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had marched to Eaſt-Town, after having lain in wait for ſome time to intercept ſuch New-England peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as might paſs between Suſquehanna and New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. There was a man and a woman with me, the man's name was John Wickiſine, we were well armed and reſolved not to be impoſed upon whatever might be the event. We went on unmoleſted, came to Fiſh Kill Ferry, and croſſed Hudſon-River, we travelled on the poſt road until we arrived at De Bois's Tavern, there we continued two days, as my companion Wickiſine wanted to hire a houſe for himſelf and family, but the landlord and him could not agree upon the terms. At this Tavern I met with one Doctor Smith, he informed me that he lived near Groton River, and that he had been at New-York upon affairs of importance: He was a man of affability and a good orator; we entered into an argument, and I found him to be a man of ſenſe and learned in the ſciences. I was ſo charmed with his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes upon philoſophy, that I could have ſpent the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of my days with him: He deſired me to ride along with him, I complied, and the ſubject of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation was nature, the productions of nature, and the primary cauſes of ſuch ſurpriſing effects. The Doctor conducted me to his own houſe, which was a tavern, and there I lodged that night: During the evening we talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about various matters, but not a word was mentioned about counterfeiting money. Among other things our converſation turned upon the tranſmutation of metals; the Doctor told me that he was maſter of that art, but that his extenſive practice of phyſick would not permit him to proſecute his diſcoveries in alchymy. I inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that I intended to begin a courſe of experiments if I could get a convenient place to carry it on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: He recommended me to Capt. Hard of New-Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, who, he ſaid, had for ſeveral years been carrying on operations of that nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:012915_0006_0F8E6E0317D793A0"/>
HAVING taken leave of Doctor Smith, I proceeded to New-Millford, enquired for Capt. Hard, and was very courteouſly received by him; I found him to be a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of ſtrict honor and integrity, and I had a very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial eſteem for him.</p>
               <p>I had not remained long there until I received a viſit from Doctor Smith; he requeſted that I would cut his coat of arms, which he told me he wanted to put into his books and gave me a precedent that was done in England. I cut the plate and ſent it to him by one David Thar, whom he ſent to receive it; ſoon after the Doctor favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with another viſit, and after a long prefatory diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, informed me that he wanted more work done, and that if I would take it in hand to execute it I ſhould be handſomely rewarded. I enquired what he wanted en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved, he ſaid he would ſhow me a pattern, and ſoon after brought me a ten ſhilling bill and aſked if I could imitate it; I anſwered him in the affirmative, but told him I did not chooſe to do ſuch work, being then engaged in philoſophic ſtudies: I repreſented to him the enormity of the crime, and endeavoured to diſuade him from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in it: his reply was, that the great men are guilty of greater frauds, and that for his part he did not mean to enrich himſelf by emitting a large number of bills, his principal motive being curioſity to know how near he could imitate the true bill. I told him it was impoſſible to do it ſo exact as not to be diſtinguiſhable from the genuine bill: He ſaid that a little difference was not material, with ſundry other words to that effect. Capt. Hard, underſtanding his errand, gave him a ſharp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primand, and told me that if I worked for the Doctor I ſhould not ſtay one hour longer in his houſe: I promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that I would not, but one word brought on another, we differed, and I left him.—Oh! unhappy day!—for having no overſeer to watch for my good I met again with Mr. Smith; who, taking advantage of my week capacity, debauched my judgment with ſophiſtical rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning and made me err.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:012915_0007_0F8E6E05C3627868"/>
ANXIOUS to improve myſelf by philoſophic ſtudies, naturally inclined to learning, remarkably inquiſitive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſecrets of nature and ſcience, I travelled to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratoga, with an intention to ſet up my works; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly built a ſhop for that purpoſe at the houſe of John Davis. I agreed with Capt. Garriſon to bring me ſtills, glaſſes, and other materials from New-York. When theſe things arrived I prepaired to begin my operations, but a miſunderſtanding happening between the woman of the houſe and me, I reſolved to leave that place.</p>
               <p>I went down to New-Britain, but it being the winter ſeaſon and the cold very intenſe, I could not erect my works, but embraced that opportunity to tranſcribe my philoſophy book, which I did at the houſe of Samuel Wheeler.</p>
               <p>As I underſtood that Doctor Whiting kept potters works, and having occaſion for ſome earthen ſtills, I went to his houſe and gave him directions about them; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſome time before they could be finiſhed, and in the interim I employed myſelf in preparing medicines at Samuel Wheeler's houſe.</p>
               <p>I went again to Doctor Whiting's, expecting my ſtills were done, but found they were not. This circumſtance retarded my buſineſs, and becauſe I applied cloſely to my ſtudies and ſpent the greateſt part of my time in my ſhop, a report was circulated about the country that I was counterfeiting bills and coining money. I declare, before God! that the ſaid report, was <hi>falſe!</hi> for I did not make nor offer to paſs any bad money, nor never had any thoughts on that ſubject. Conſcious of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, I gave myſelf no trouble about their ſurmiſes, until I heard that they had applied for and obtained a warrant, either at Kinderhook or Clavarack, againſt me. This made me very uneaſy and confirmed my determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of abandoning a place where the people were ſo cenſorious and malicious.</p>

I then reſolved upon a recluſe way of life, and erected a houſe in a ſolitary place, where intended to carry on my chymical proceſs; but having made an excurſion from my habitation, I met with one Hulburt, who informed me that he had been long ſearching for me, and that he was employed by Daniel Lewis of Sheffield.</p>
               <p>WHEN he acquainted me with his buſineſs, I told him that nothing could induce me to be concerned in his Scheme; that being now an old man, and my eye-ſight much decayed, I had given over engraving nice work; and that being then engaged in other buſineſs, I had neither time nor inclination to comply with his requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; but he perſiſted to perſuade and make me large offers.</p>
               <p>I am now tried, convicted and condemned, on ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of having counterfeited the currency of this province; but, if the word of a dying man can be taken, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of the crime imputed to me. I never did make, ſign or paſs counterfeit Bills; nor had I any hand in the ſcheme further than what I have related. In my manner of living I always ſtudied not to give offence even to Children; and as I practiced no deceit, it never occured to me that others would uſe it. In the days of proſperity Gold and Silver was not too precious for me; but no ſooner did adverſity appear, than thoſe whom I former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagined to be my beſt friends, having obtained their ends and glutted their miſchevious appetites; they compaſſed me about like a troubled ſea, and having the poiſon of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> by large offers and inſinuation, it is not ſurpriſing if he ſurrender, eſpecially if his poverty and good nature are taken the advantge of. By over perſuaſion I engrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to gratify thoſe who are now cleared and have got

their pardon, but it plainly appearth that I never coined, diſperſed, nor paſſed one penny of bad money; but it ſeems that I muſt be an <hi>Eſcape Goat</hi> to bear their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions into the other world. LORD ſtrengthen me to bear their burden in this world, and be merciful to my ſoul in that which is to come.</p>
               <p>As it is appointed for all men once to die, and it ſeems that the time of my diſſolution draweth near, I deſire that theſe my tranſactions may be publiſhed for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the public; for that reaſon, Meſſrs, Printers, I have ſent theſe manuſcripts to you; print them with all convenient ſpeed, and you will greatly oblige your hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervant,</p>

                  <hi>IN the courſe of my peregrinations through Virginia, I came to a certain gentleman's houſe which I made my home for upwards of four years. During that time I became acquainted with one of his daughters, and at laſt we bought proper, and indeed it was high time, to marry; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we entered into the connubial ſtate. About half a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> after, my wife and me held a conſultation upon the poſture four affairs; and, after a good deal of confabulation, we included that living with her parents did not ſuit our conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. I propoſed to go and ſeek a place that would be more <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="5 letters">

<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012915_0011_0F8E6E085CD005B8"/>
ſhe acquieſed, and, having made ſome neceſſary preparations for our journey, we ſet off together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We rode about eighty miles up into the country, and came to a quaker ſettlement called Opechen Creek, where we put up at a</hi> friend's <hi>houſe; the gentleman was extremely civil, and we diſcourſed very jocoſely together. He aſked where we were journeying:—we anſwered, to ſeek our fortune, and enquired if they wanted to hire a School maſter at that ſettlement? He ſaid they did, and ſhould be very fond of a good one. His reply pleaſed me exceeding well, and we determined to abide with them; the</hi> freinds <hi>being a very good people to live with, eſpecially if they find that thoſe whom they employ are honeſt and have merit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I engaged with them a year. They built a houſe for me and my wife, and a ſchool houſe adjacent. When the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were finiſhed, the</hi> brothers <hi>and</hi> ſiſters, <hi>as they call them, preſented us with every utenſil neceſſary for houſe keeping. We then made as reſpectable an appearance as any of our neighbours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I opened my ſchool, went on extraordinary well, and had the univerſal applauſe of my conſtituents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GENERAL BRADDOCK'S <hi>defeat happening about four months after our ſettlement at Opechen, threw a damp upon our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; I was in my ſchool houſe when the ſad news arrived; the whole ſettlement was alarmed, being apprehenſive that the victors would follow their blow and ravage the country with fire and ſword. I ſtill continued my ſchool, but, in about two months after, the murder ſhout was heard in our neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; numbers of people were killed and ſcalped, and the miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fugitives who eſcaped with life were at a loſs where to fly for protection! At laſt I was obliged to abandon my happy ſettlement, and, with my wife, repair to a fort; there not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained near two months, but the place being much <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                     </gap> to leave the

fort, and not chooſing to ſettle again in a country ſo open to the incurſions of a mercileſs enemy, we prepared for a journey into the province of Pennſylvania; we arrived ſafe there, rented a room, and I reſumed my practice of ſurgery and curing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. I had ſurpriſing good ſucceſs, and obtained the name of an experienced practitioner in phyſic, but the tide of fortune a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain turned and ſet hard againſt me; I catched the infection of the ſmall-pox; the eruption was copious and the ſymtoms very unfavourable. I entreated my wife to leave my room and keep at a diſtance from me, but her tenderneſs for me would not permit her to comply with my requeſt. I was under vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent apprehenſions, that if ſhe got infected, in the condition ſhe was then in, that the conſequence would be fatal. Alas! my imaginary diſtreſs was very ſoon realized; ſhe ſickened, the puſtles appeared, and on the ſixteenth day of her illneſs, to my inexpreſſible grief, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I had a boy three years of age, who was dangerouſly ill of the ſame diſtemper that had been fatal to his mother; at the ſame time, I was not ſufficiently recovered to quit my bed; my ſituation was truly pitiable, I was ſick, dejected, and forlorn, among ſtrangers; my expence for attendance, nurſing, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I may ſay for every thing, amounted to a conſiderable ſum, and I was then in a place where ſomething could not be had for nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>UPON <hi>my recovery I propoſed to viſit my old friends the Quakers, but hearing that times were altered, much for the worſe, in their ſettlement, I declined it. Having agreed with an old welch widow for my boy's board and lodging, I continued my practice of ſurgery and had tolerable ſucceſs. As ſoon as my boy was able to go, I ſent him to ſchool, and he became a very good ſcholar—I fervently implore the A mighty to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, govern and bleſs him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE War ſtill continuing, I was, by the recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeveral gentlemen who intereſted themſelves in my behalf, appointed ſurgeon's mate to the garriſon of Aguſta; there I continued until a detachment of our men were draughted to go againſt Fort Du Queſne; our principal doctor went with them, but before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture he wrote to the commiſſioners in my behalf, without informing me of the favour he had conferred
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012915_0013_0F8E6E0A396CD228"/>
upon me. In conſequence of his recomendation I was ſent for to Philadelphia, and there received a commiſſion to be cheif ſurgeon to the garriſon of Auguſta; at the ſame time I got a cheſt of medicines and then went back to my ſtation, where I continued ſeven years. At the concluſion of the war I was diſcharged at Lancaſter, in Pennſylvania: Being then out of employment, I went down to Virginia to viſit my father in law, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe parts. My tranſactions, after that time, I have mentioned in my Journal, to which I refer the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hereof.</p>
