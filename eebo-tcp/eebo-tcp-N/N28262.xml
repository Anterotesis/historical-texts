            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HAD I language at command, and the time and my tears would permit me, to diſplay, in juſt colors to your view, the great, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, the extenſive bleſſings, of which we in common with our country, ſo largely participate; I might, by an eaſy and natural tranſition, lead you to the contemplation of the character of this greateſt and beſt of men, in the celebration of whoſe obſequies, we, my afflicted friends, are this day, with one voice, and, I truſt, with one heart, and a pious ſenſibility, engaged.</p>
            <p>THE ſacred altars of our holy religion, the graceful appendage of mirth, in ſeaſons of feſtivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and joy, and the only ſolid ſupport and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, in a day of tribulation and gloom, like the preſent, are neither removed, nor defiled with

unhallowed hands; our rulers are from ourſelves, and the men of our choice; we ſit under our own vine and fig-tree, without moleſtation or fear; the ſolacing endearments of domeſtic ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and the pleaſures of the broader and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded circles of ſocial intercourſe, are undiſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the hard-earned fruit of the huſbandman's toil is not ſnatched from his hand, by the ruth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs graſp of violence; the uſeful artiſan finds in his labor, a reward for his ingenuity and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; in his returns the merchant admits a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for his ſagacity and enterprize—our eyes are, every where, delighted with the ſwelling can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas, the buſy ſtreet, the bending harveſt, and the cattle upon a thouſand hills: of this aſſemblage of public and private happineſs, how large a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall we aſcribe to the virtues, the talents, and the unexampled patriotiſm of this favorite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of indulgent Heaven?</p>
            <p>At an important epocha of our hiſtory, when our country was threatened with the deprivation, of its invaluable rights, of every thing dear to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened freemen; when, in the infancy of our national exiſtence, we were called, in Providence, to contend with a power grown grey in the field of Mars; when our infantine ſtature and armour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the ridicule and contempt, with which the

with that charming tranſaction, and did not follow, with a thouſand bleſſings, this revered man to the delightful ſhades of his long wiſhed for retreat? in theſe bliſsful abodes, the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeat of his anceſtors, he enjoyed a compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for all his toils, in the poſſeſſion of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious integrity, and the gratifying reflections on his devotion to the public good. Here he fondly hoped to ſpend the reſt of his days, in tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and uſefulneſs, dividing by a juſt diſtribution, and a wiſe economy, his precious time and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful income, to the claims of juſtice and charity, hoſpitality and religion.</p>
            <p>Alas! how ſhort is human bliſs, how tranſitory all ſublunary enjoyments! hardly was it realized that we had no more a foe without, when a ſtate of things was perceived within, more dreadful than war itſelf; the band of our union was ſo nearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that an attempt to draw it cloſer, would have ſerved but to betray its weakneſs—jealouſly and diſtruſt, the deadly bane of government, had poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned our political atmoſphere—a dark cloud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing over our heads, portended a direful explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion—countenances gathered paleneſs—fightings without could have given a kind relief to more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming fears within—to advance or recede, or be ſtationary, appeared almoſt equally preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous—between

            <p>IN obedience to thoſe feelings which are ever excited in the human heart, at the loſs of a friend, a benefactor and a father; we are now aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, to pay our laſt public tribute of affection and veneration, to the memory of our beloved WASHINGTON. And I doubt not, but upon this occaſion, we ſhall give free indulgence, to that voluntary ſympathy, which is ſo rapidly ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from heart to heart, throughout the continent of America, and will as ſoon as the ſad tidings reach the tranſ-atlantic ſhores, wrap even Europe in a ſable mantle. For when virtue expires, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture receives a ſhock, and the plaintive moan is echoed through the world! I apprehend how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, fellow citizens, that it will not be expected
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037666_0010_100F35F233815D20"/>
from me, that I attempt to pourtray the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our virtuous chief; for that taſk is too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, and ſublime for me to undertake. Let it therefore ſuffice, if I make a few remarks, on the propriety of the ſolemn pomp now before us; and point out a few of thoſe general traits, in the character of our venerable deceaſed, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to raiſe him aloof from his fellow men, and ſhed an unknown dignity and luſtre on the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race.</p>
            <p>IN touching on the character of the deceaſed, I ſhall confine myſelf merely to a comparative view of him, with others who have been emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently diſtinguiſhed in the world. And altho' I ſhould be unwilling to tarniſh the glory of any man, which has been fairly and honourably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; whether he be living in hiſtory only, or is now active on the ſtage of life; yet I deem it no robbery or diminution of their glory, to ſay they all fade in the compariſon. All other great characters of which we have any knowledge, have been diſtinguiſhed for ſome one, extraordinary talent or virtue, which has given them celebrity and fame, when compared with common men. Of this claſs hiſtory, and many living characters, afford us numerous examples, and at the loſs of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037666_0011_100F35F6875F8ED8"/>
theſe ornaments of ſociety there will ever be a partial mourning, for they are valuable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant in ſociety—perhaps a nation may deplore the loſs of a great general, counſellor or judge: ſcience may loſe an able ſupporter, and a liberal patron: religion may lament the loſs of a pious and a virtuous man, nay a doctor deep ſkilled in the ſcience of theology: or even the humble walks of life, may loſe a kind friend and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful benefactor: yet the grief in all theſe inſtances is limited, for their talents and their virtues are circumſcribed.</p>
            <p>BUT never until the time of WASHINGTON, has a character appeared ſo richly adorned, with all the great and noble virtues of which humanity is ſuſceptible. He is not like other heroes, ſages or patriots, whoſe names are enrolled in the book of fame; for no hiſtory can poliſh his glory, and even malign cenſure, dare not pluck a ſprig from his well earned laurels. Heaven ſeemed to have formed the man WASHINGTON, out of its choiceſt materials, and robbed, as it were, humanity of its virtues to form one perfect man. Being thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with ſuperlative virtues and talents, he was introduced, on the ſtage of life, and aſſigned a part in a ſcene which had never before been acted
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037666_0012_100F35F8CC129F38"/>
in the the nations of the earth. Paſſing over the earlier parts of his life, let us view him at that important criſis, when he managed the ſublime and happy conflict between an infant, weak and inexperienced nation, and a haughty, imperious and overbearing kingdom! Armed with that panoply, which Jehovah had made for him, bold in the cauſe of juſtice, and ſecure in the ſmiles of his God, like David, though a ſtripling in the arts of war, he baffled the Goliahs of Great Britain, and led in triumph her armies, at his chariot wheels. Even amidſt the dangers which for ſeven bloody years, marred the peace and felicity of the American people; behold the virtuous chieftain conducting the infant America, through perils and dangers before unknown. And through all this ſtruggle which gave birth to America, ſelf-compoſed and collected, his active and pervading mind, could, even in the greateſt difficulties reſort to avenues of prudence and ſafety. Even at that awful moment when Providence ſeemed to have withdrawn his protecting hand! at that dark hour, when deſpair had ſeized the American boſom; when the eagle of our country drooped its extended wings in token of grief! Say ye pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, who had the honor of fighting under his banners, did his dignity leſſen? did his valour and wiſdom appear leſs active and ſublime, than

when ſucceſs danced on his helmet, and gliſtened on his ſword? Your anſwer is no—for with a fortitude and equanimity, peculiar to himſelf, he met danger undiſmayed, and ſoared above the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of life—Nay more, that firmneſs, temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and majeſty, which uniformly diſtinguiſhed him, became more conſpicuous in the hour of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and diſtreſs. Nor was this mighty man like other great men, elated with ſucceſs; but his keen mind, reviewing the paſt and foreſeeing the future, made him calm and tranquil, even in his glory; and ever diſplayed ſuch a dignified majeſty as aſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated him more to the gods, than mortal man. Thus by his wiſdom, having protected the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his country, and ſupported her by his ſingle arm; having trained up a numerous hoſt of hardy and well diſciplined ſoldiers to be her future bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, and ratified the birth and independence of his country; behold the reſplendent virtues, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him to the mild and peaceful walks of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life! And here let me aſk, where is the man, WASHINGTON excepted, who with the ſame opportunities, would not have derived ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal advantages to himſelf? who would not have acquired wealth? or perhaps by force of thoſe armies which at the cloſe of the laſt war, were devoted to his name and perſon, would have

eſtabliſhed himſelf lord paramount of the country he ſaved? This our hero ſpurned; having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted himſelf to the cauſe of juſtice, having reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued a ſinking nation, the great object of his heart being accompliſhed; he retired to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtered vale of life, to enjoy in common with his fellow citizens, that peace and happineſs his valor won. Above the reach of mercenary views, beyond the power of adulation, behold him gently ſettling on Mount Vernon, like Noah's ark on the mountain of Arrarat, a ſure preſage that the ſtorm was o'er.</p>
            <p>TOO important however to remain long a private citizen, ſee him again ſtep forth, at the voice of his country to conduct the auguſt councils of our nation. See with what alacrity, he again aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the gentle pleaſures of domeſtic life, to make that people virtuous and happy, whom his valor had made independent.—Was it glory that again induced him to come forth and guide the devious mazes of our national councils? Surely not, or the experiment was hazardous and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and his laurels were yet blooming with their freſheſt verdure—Was it the deſire of wealth, which prompted him to obey the ſecond call of his country? No; for he had uniformly declined

accepting any compenſation—But it was that ſame virtue, which at firſt made him riſque his life in the cauſe of freedom and juſtice, which influenced him to accept the chair of ſtate, and conduct his beloved nation to happineſs and honor—and when he had firmly eſtabliſhed a government, which was calculated to enſure and perpetuate national felicity; having given the firſt example that true liberty is compatible with government and law, he again with redoubled luſtre retired from public cares; having left a benizon to that people, whom he had foſtered in infancy, and inſtructed in manhood. And here it would ſeem that his public career muſt end—and it would my friends, had not this godlike man, even in the wane of life, at a period, when by the common laws of nature, ambition ſlumbers, and happineſs is ultimately blended, with quietude and eaſe, at the remote appearance of hoſtilities, to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try he loved, once more ſtepped forth, and graſped the ſword of his earlier days to inſpire millions and deter the foe. Here then behold a climax of glory, honor and reputation, which the deeds of four thouſand years, has never equalled! At laſt perfectly compoſed, and prepared for the event, he is tranſlated in a moment, from this

earth, to the boſom of his God, ready to give a full account of thoſe talents committed to his charge, and receive the meed of a well ſpent life, accompanied, with well done thou good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervant.</p>
            <p>YES, fellow citizens he is no more! His body now ſlumbers in the dark chambers of death! his ſhield is broken! his ſword fallen from that once nervous arm! That voice which once commanded the liſtening attention of the ſenate, is ſilent! yet his name ſtands written at full length in the volume of fame, and will continue ſo long as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture endures, the firſt of heroes, patriots, ſages! and his virtues ſtill live, and will ever continue to live, in the memory of an affectionate and grateful people.</p>
            <p>HOW becoming is it then in us, to pay all due honors to his memory—we all <hi>feel</hi> as though we had <hi>ſeen</hi> him—we know him as our earthly father; eſteemed him as our friend, and revered him as our protector—we were of his family—for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized us as his children; and nothing but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded parental affection, could have induced him to have undergone the fatigues and dangers which he did, to promote our happineſs and ſecure our

ſafety. The emblems of grief, which are now exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited before us; the deep toned thunder of cannon which are now proclaiming the ſad tidings! The drooping ſtandards, which once waved in triumph round his head—the ſolemn proceſſion, which is the laſt kind office we can afford the dead! All, ought to inſpire us with manly ſorrow, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our hearts with grief; for while the United States are ſympathiſing in ſorrow, at the general loſs, were we to refrain, would be paying an ill compliment to our own virtue, humanity and gratitude.</p>
            <p>BUT, my countrymen let us not deſpair—for altho' WASHINGTON is viſibly departed from us; yet his ſpirit, ſhall hover over the city which bears his immortal name, and henceforth be the Guardian Genius of theſe United States! And may it ever inſpire future patriots with the ſame virtue, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and honor, which ſo eminently character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed his whole life.</p>
