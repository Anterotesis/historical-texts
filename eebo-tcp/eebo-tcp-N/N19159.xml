            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>IN obedience to two reſolutions of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, one of the 21ſt inſtant, directing the Secretary of the Treaſury to report a plan for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo much of the Public Debt, as by the Act, intituled, "An Act making proviſion for the debt of the United States," the United States have reſerved the right to redeem—the other of the 22nd inſtant, directing him to report the plan of a proviſion for the reimburſement of the Loan made of the Bank of the United States, purſuant to the 11th ſection of the Act, intituled, "An Act to incorporate the Subſcribers to the Bank of the United States,"—The ſaid Secretary reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſubmits the following Report.</head>
            <p>THE expediency of taking meaſures for the regular redemption of the Public Debt, according to the right which has been reſerved to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, being wiſely predetermined, by the reſolution of the Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives referring the ſubject to the Secretary, nothing remains for him, but to endeavour to ſelect and ſubmit the moſt eligible means of providing for the execution of that important object.</p>
            <p>With this view, the firſt enquiry, which naturally preſents itſelf, is, whether the exiſting revenues are, or are not, adequate to the purpoſe?—</p>
            <p>The eſtimates which accompany the report of the Secretary of the 14th inſt. will ſhew, that during the continuance of the preſent Indian war, the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations for intereſt and the demands for the current ſervice are likely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt the product of the exiſting revenues; though they afford a valuable ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus beyond the permanent objects of expenditure, which, it is hoped, may ere long be advantageouſly applied to accelerate the extinguiſhment of the debt.</p>
            <p>In the mean time however, and until the reſtoration of peace, the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that reſource, in this way, muſt of neceſſity be ſuſpended—and either the buſineſs of redemption muſt be deferred, or recourſe muſt be had to other expedients.</p>
            <p>But did no ſuch temporary neceſſity, for reſorting to other expedients, exiſt, the doing of it would ſtill be recommended by weighty conſiderations. It would appear, in the abſtract, adviſeable, to leave the ſurplus of the preſent revenues free, to be applied to ſuch caſual exigencies as may from to time oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur—to occaſional purchaſes of the debt when not exhauſted by ſuch exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, to the payment of intereſt on any balances, which may be found due to particular ſtates, upon the general ſettlement of accounts, and finally to the payment of intereſt on the deferred part of the debt, when the period for ſuch payment arrives. There is a reaſonable proſpect, that if not diverted, it will be found adequate to the two laſt important purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Relinquiſhing then the idea of an immediate application of the preſent reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to the object in view—it remains to examine what other modes are in the option of the Legiſlature.</p>
            <p>Loans, from time to time, equal to the ſums annually redeemable, and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed on the ſame revenues, which are now appropriated to pay the intereſt upon thoſe ſums, offer themſelves as one expedient, which may be employed with a degree of advantage. As there is a probability of borrowing at a lower rate of intereſt, a material ſaving would reſult; and even this reſource, if none better could be deviſed, ought not to be neglected.</p>
            <p>But it is obvious, that to rely upon this reſource alone would be to do little towards the final exoneration of the nation. To ſtop at that point would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:024927_0004_0FCD8E90000E7B08"/>
be neither provident nor ſatisfactory. The intereſts as well as the expectations of the Union require ſomething more effectual.</p>
            <p>The eſtabliſhment of additional revenues is the remaining reſource. This, if the buſineſs is to be undertaken in earneſt, is unavoidable. And a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence may reaſonably be entertained, that the community will ſee with ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction the employment of thoſe means, which alone can be effectual, for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing an end, in itſelf ſo important, and ſo much an object of general deſire. It cannot fail to be univerſally felt, that if the end is to be attained, the neceſſary means muſt be employed.</p>
            <p>It can only be expected that care be taken to chooſe ſuch as are liable to feweſt objections, and that in the modifications of the buſineſs in other reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, due regard be had to the preſent and progreſſive circumſtances of the country.</p>
            <p>Aſſuming it as the baſis of a plan of redemption, that additional revenues are to be provided, the further enquiry divides itſelf into the following branches:
<list>
                  <item>I. Shall a revenue be immediately conſtituted, equal to the full ſum which may at preſent be redeemed, according to the terms of the contract?</item>
                  <item>II. Shall a revenue be conſtituted from year to year, equal only to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the ſum to be redeemed in each year, coupling with this operation an annual loan, commenſurate with ſuch ſum?—Or,</item>
                  <item>III. Shall a revenue be conſtituted each year, ſo much exceeding the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the ſum to be redeemed, as to be ſufficient, within a ſhort definite term of time, to diſcharge the principal itſelf; coupling with this operation alſo, an annual loan, equal to the ſum to be annually redeemed, and appropriating the revenue created to its diſcharge, within the term which ſhall have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt plan, beſides being completely effectual, would be eventually moſt oeconomical; but conſidering to what a magnitude the revenues of the United States have grown in a ſhort period, it is not eaſy to pronounce how far the faculty of paying might not be ſtrained by any ſudden conſiderable augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereſoever immediately placed; while the rapid progreſs of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in population and reſource ſeems to afford a moral certainty, that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary augmentation may be made with convenience, by ſucceſſive ſteps, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a moderate term of time—and invites to temporary and partial ſuſpenſions, as capable of conciliating the reaſonable accommodation of the community with the vigorous proſecution of the main deſign. For theſe, and for other reaſons which will readily occur, the courſe of providing immediately the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ſum to be redeemed, is conceived <hi>not</hi> to be the moſt eligible.</p>
            <p>The ſecond plan, though much more efficacious than that of annual loans, bottomed on the revenues now appropriated for the payment of intereſt on the ſums to be redeemed, does not appear to be ſufficiently efficacious. The ſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule A. will ſhew the effect of it to the 1ſt of January 1802, when the deferred debt will become redeemable in the proportions ſtipulated. Suppoſing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtment of the intereſt which is each year liberated, together with that which has been, and will be releaſed by purchaſes, purſuant to proviſions heretofore made, in the purchaſe of 6 per cent. ſtock; a ſum of principal equal to 2,043,837 dollars and 7 cents would be ſunk, and a clear annuity, equal to 459,212 dollars and 82 cents would be created, towards further redemptions; but the fund then neceſſary for the future progreſſive redemption of the debt, according to the right reſerved, would be 1,126,616 dollars and 44 cents, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by 667,!
 403 dollars and 62 cents, the amount of the redeeming fund.—Something more effectual than this is certainly deſirable, and appears to be practicable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:024927_0005_0FCD8E916E09FED8"/>
The laſt of the three plans beſt accords with the moſt accurate view, which the Secretary has been able to take of the public intereſt.</p>
            <p>In its application, it is of material conſequence to endeavour to accompliſh theſe two points: 1ſt. The complete diſcharge of the ſums annually redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, within the period prefixed, and the reimburſement, within the ſame pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, of all auxiliary loans, which may have been made for that purpoſe.—2ndly. The conſtituting, by the expiration of that period, a clear annual fund competent to the future redemption of the debt, to the extent of the right reſerved.</p>
            <p>The period, to which it is conceived the plan ought to refer, is the 1ſt day of January 1802; becauſe <hi>then</hi> the firſt payment, on account of the principal of the deferred debt, may rightfully be made.</p>
            <p>In conformity to theſe ideas, the following plan is moſt reſpectfully ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; premiſing, that the ſum redeemable for the firſt year of the 6 per cent. ſtock, bearing a preſent intereſt, is computed at 550,000 dollars.</p>
            <p>Let an annual fund be conſtituted during the preſent ſeſſion, equal to 103,199 dollars and 6 cents, to begin to accrue from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of January 1793. Let the ſum of 550,000 dollars be borrowed upon the credit of this annuity, reimburſeable within five years, that is, by the 1ſt of January 1799. The ſum borrowed to be applied, on the 1ſt of January 1794, to the firſt payment on account of the principal of the debt.</p>
            <p>The propoſed annuity will reimburſe the ſum borrowed with intereſt, by the firſt of January 1799, and will thenceforth, be free for any further application.</p>
            <p>The ſum redeemable the ſecond year, that is, on the 1ſt of January 1795, is computed at 583,000 dollars.</p>
            <p>Let an annual fund be conſtituted, during the ſecond ſeſſion after the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, equal to 109,391 dollars and 60 cents, to begin to accrue from the 1ſt of January 1794. Let the ſum of 583,000 dollars be borrowed upon the credit of this annuity, reimburſeable within five years, that is, by 1ſt of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary 1800.

            <p>The propoſed annuity will reimburſe the ſum borrowed with intereſt, by the 1ſt of January 1800, and will be thenceforth free for any further appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>The ſum redeemable the third year, that is, on the 1ſt of January 1796, is computed at 617,980 dollars.</p>
            <p>Let an annual fund be conſtituted, during the third ſeſſion, after the preſent, equal to 115,955 dollars and 17 cents, to begin to accrue from the 1ſt of January 1795.

            <p>The propoſed annuity will reimburſe the ſum borrowed with intereſt, by the 1ſt of January 1801.</p>
            <p>The ſum redeemable the fourth year, that is, on the 1ſt of January 1797, is computed at 655,058 dollars and 80 cents.</p>
            <p>Let an annual fund be conſtituted during the fourth ſeſſion after the preſent, equal to 122,912 dollars and 48 cents, to begin to accrue from the 1ſt of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary 1796.

            <p>Let an annual fund be conſtituted, during the eighth ſeſſion after the preſent, equal to 423,583 dollars and 64 cents, to begin to accrue from the 1ſt of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, 1800. Let the ſum of 826,996 dollars and 65 cents be borrowed upon the credit of this annuity, reimburſeable within one year, that is, on the 1ſt of January, 1802.

            <p>The then exiſting means for the diſcharge of this ſum, ariſing from the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the plan, will be—</p>
            <p>1ſt. The amount of the annuity conſtituted the third year, which will have been liberated by reimburſement of the third loan. 2d. The arrears of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt not previouſly appropriated, and which are computed at 200,000 dollars.</p>
            <p>There will conſequently be a deficiency this year of 810,661 dollars and 27 cents, which will require to be ſupplied by a temporary loan, to be reimburſed out of the ſurplus of the fund, which, on the 1ſt of January, 1802, will exiſt
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024927_0007_0FCD8E97A3D67810"/>
for future redemptions, and which ſurplus will be ſufficient to reimburſe this temporary loan in about thirteen years and a half.</p>
            <p>It may be proper to remark, that this deficiency upon one year is ſuffered to exiſt, to avoid an unneceſſary augmentation of revenue, materially beyond the ſum permanently requiſite. No inconvenience enſues, becauſe this temporary deficiency is made up by the ſurplus of the permanent fund, within the period mentioned. And that fund, from the 1ſt of January, 1802, is adequate to all future redemptions, in the full proportion permitted by the contract.</p>
            <p>The table in the ſchedule B, herewith ſubmitted, will ſhew in one view the principles and operation of this plan.</p>
            <p>The ſchedule C will exhibit the means of conſtituting the ſeveral annuities propoſed to be eſtabliſhed. From it, will be ſeen, that the propoſed annuities are to be compoſed, partly of taxes to be ſucceſſively laid, at the reſpective pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of creating them, partly of the ſurplus-dividend to be expected on the ſtock belonging to the government, in the bank of the United States, beyond the intereſt to be paid on account of it, and partly of the funds heretofore pledged for the payment of intereſt, which will have been liberated upon ſo much of the debt, as will have been extinguiſhed.</p>

            <p>The ſum, which will have been redeemed <hi>prior</hi> to the 1ſt day of January, 1802, will be 5,443,607 dollars and 37 cents. The ſum redeemable on the 1ſt of January, 1802, will be 1,126,616 dollars and 44 cents; and the fund, which will thenceforth exiſt for the purpoſe of future redemption, (as is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſhewn by the ſchedule D) will be 1,210,744 dollars and 34 cents, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the ſum ſtrictly neceſſary by 84,127 dollars and 90 cents; a fund, which including the intereſt from year to year liberated, will, as already inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, be completely adequate to the final redemption of the whole amount of the 6 per cent. ſtock (as well the deferred as that bearing a preſent intereſt) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the right, which has been reſerved for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, a further impreſſion will be made upon the debt by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtment of the reſidue of the funds, heretofore eſtabliſhed, in the purchaſe of it; and it is hoped, that the reſtoration of peace with the Indians will enable the application of the ſurplus of the exiſting revenues, together with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds of the ceded lands in our Weſtern Territory, to the ſame object. Theſe, whenever they can be brought into action, will be important aids, materially accelerating the ultimate redemption of the intire debt—The employment of theſe reſources, when it can be done, by encreaſing the intereſt-fund, will proportionably leſſen the neceſſity of uſing the reſource of taxation for creating the propoſed annuities;—if the government ſhall judge it adviſeable to avail itſelf of the ſubſtitute, which may accrue from that circumſtance.</p>
            <p>Having now given a general view of the plan, which has appeared upon the whole the moſt eligible, it is neceſſary in the next place to preſent to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Houſe the requiſite funds for commencing the execution of it. Theſe will embrace a proviſion for the firſt annuity only; that alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring by the plan immediate proviſion. With regard to a proviſion for the ſubſequent annuities, which is propoſed to be ſucceſſive, the Secretary will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf with this general obſervation, that he diſcerns no intrinſic diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024927_0008_0FCD8E98F4793A40"/>
in making proviſion for them, as faſt as ſhall be neceſſary, with, due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to the people, and conſiſtently with the idea of abſtaining from taxing lands and buildings (with the ſtock and implements of farms) reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as a reſource for thoſe great emergencies, which call for a full exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the contributive faculties of a country.</p>
            <p>The following means for conſtituting the firſt annuity, are reſpectfully ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, viz.</p>
            <p>Annual ſurplus of the dividend on the ſtock of government in the bank of the United States, beyond the intereſt to be paid out of the ſaid dividend, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated at 60,000 dollars.</p>
            <p>Tax on horſes, kept or uſed for the purpoſe of riding, or of drawing any coach, chariot, phaeton, chaiſe, chair, ſulkey or other carriage for <hi>conveyance of perſons;</hi> excepting and exempting all horſes, which are <hi>uſually</hi> and <hi>chiefly</hi> employed for the purpoſes of huſbandry, or in drawing waggons, wains, drays, carts or other carriages, for the tranſportation of produce, goods, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize and commodities, or in carrying burthens in the courſe of the trade or occupation of the perſons to whom they reſpectively belong, and the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of perſons in the military ſervice of the United States, viz.</p>
            <p>For every horſe, not above excepted and exempted, at the rate of one dollar per annum—where only one is uſed or kept by the ſame perſon, with an addition of fifty cents per annum per horſe, where more than one and not more than two horſes are kept or uſed by the ſame perſon—with an addition of one dollar per annum per horſe, where more than two, and nor more than four are kept or uſed by the ſame perſon, and with an addition of one dollar and a half dollar per horſe, per annum, where more than four are kept or uſed by the ſame perſon: Provided that this addition ſhall not be made in reſpect to horſes uſually employed in public ſtages for the conveyance of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers.</p>
            <p>This progreſſive increaſe of rates on the higher numbers has reference to the preſumption of greater wealth, which ariſes from the poſſeſſion of ſuch higher numbers.</p>
            <p>The products of this tax will probably be about equal to the reſidue of the propoſed annuity, which is 43,199 dollars and 6 cents. How near the truth this eſtimate may prove, experiment alone can, in ſo untried a caſe, decide.—An aid to this fund may be derived from the ſurplus dividend on the bank ſtock, for the half year ending the laſt of December next, which it is preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med will be not leſs than 20,000 dollars. Should a deficiency appear upon trial, it can be ſupplied by a future proviſion.</p>
            <p>Proper regulations for the collection of this tax will, it is believed, be found not difficult, if the tax itſelf ſhall be deemed eligible. Its ſimplicity has been a conſiderable recommendation of it. Qualified as it is, it is not likely to fall on any but ſuch who can afford to pay it. The exemption from the tax, in regard to horſes which are appropriated to the purpoſes of <hi>huſbandry,</hi> or of any trade or occupation, or to the tranſportation of commodities, ſeems to obviate all reaſonable objection.</p>
            <p>If, however, there ſhould appear to the legiſlature, reaſons for preferring a tax on carriages for pleaſure, which, it may be obſerved, will operate on nearly the ſame deſcription of perſons, the ſum required may, it is believed, be produced from the following arrangement of rates, viz. Upon every coach, the annual ſum of four dollars.—Upon every chariot, the annual ſum of three dollars.—Upon every other carriage <hi>for the conveyance of perſons,</hi> having four wheels, the annual ſum of two dollars;—and upon every chair, ſulkey or other carriage <hi>for the conveyance of perſons,</hi> having leſs than four wheels, the annual ſum of one dollar.</p>
            <p>The collection of this tax will be as ſimple and eaſy, and perhaps more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, than that which has been primarily ſubmitted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:024927_0009_0FCD8E9A6C0253B0"/>
With regard to the ſecond object referred to the Secretary, namely, the plan of a proviſion for the reimburſement of the loan made of the bank of the United States, purſuant to the XIth ſection of the act by which it is incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated;—the following is reſpectfully ſubmitted, (to wit,) That power be given by law to borrow the ſum due, to be applied to that reimburſement; and that ſo much of the dividend on the ſtock of the government in the bank as may be neceſſary, be appropriated for paying the intereſt of the ſum to be borrowed.</p>
            <p>From this operation, it is obvious, that a ſaving to the government will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, equal to the difference between the intereſt which will be payable on the the new loan, and that which is payable on the ſum now due to the bank. If the propoſed loan can be effected, at the rate of thoſe laſt made in Holland, the nett ſaving to the government may be computed at the annual ſum of 35,000 dollars; which ſaving, whatever it may be, is contemplated as part of the means for conſtituting the propoſed annuities.</p>
            <p>The benefit of this arrangement will be accelerated, if proviſion be made for the application of the proceeds of any loans, heretofore obtained, to the payment ſuggeſted on the condition of re-placing the ſums which may be ſo applied out of the proceeds of the loan or loans, which ſhall be made pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to the power above propoſed to be given.</p>
            <p>It will alſo conduce to the general end in view, if the legiſlature ſhall think proper to authoriſe the inveſtment of the funds, deſtined for purchaſes of the debt, in purchaſes of 6 per cent. ſtock at the market price, though above par. The comparative prices of the ſeveral kinds of ſtock have been, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may be, ſuch as to render it more profitable to make inveſtments in the 6 per cents, than in any other ſpecies of ſtock.</p>
