            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN the great ſcale of beings, mankind hold a digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſtation. The human mind, capable of improvement, under advantageous cultivation, progreſſes in knowledge and refinements, honourary in their nature, and ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in their conſequences. Individuals, with privileges of this kind, ſhine as lights in the world. Societies, compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of characters improved in ſcience and virtue, have eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry advantage in their ſocial connection.</p>
            <p>BY long experience, the jarring paſſions and intereſts of men, ſhew the neceſſity of Government. Various have been the forms, by which mankind have enjoyed diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed privileges. A particular diſcuſſion of all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Government, will not be expected upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, as many of this reſpectable audience are better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, than the ſpeaker. An attempt of this, would be a departure from duty.</p>
            <p>THAT Eccleſiaſtical Conſcitution, exhibited in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, is the foundation upon which the Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion are placed. It contains thoſe rules and

regulations which we are called to vindicate, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> we are furniſhed with a code of laws and precepts, admirably ſuited to governors, and governed—rules deſigned to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote general happineſs here, and to prepare for a far more exalted ſtate in the regions of immortality. Theſe are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar excellencies in the Oracles of Truth.</p>
            <p>IN the early ages of time, Government was confined to private families; but when men multiplied, it was conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with infinite wiſdom to point out methods by which there ſhould be a Government upon a more extenſive ſcale. This took place with the people of Iſrael, while in the land of Egypt. The Egyptians, under a pretence that Iſrael would increaſe in numbers and power, treated them in a manner incompatible with humanity. Whereupon the Lord was pleaſed to provide for them a deliverer—to raiſe up Moſes, remarkably to preſerve him in his infancy, to appear unto him in a burning buſh, to appoint him a ruler, and to accompany him with ſuch proofs of his divine miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as were convincing to a mind not clouded with ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or blinded with prejudice.</p>
            <p>THE good man, with reluctance, modeſtly accepted the appointment, with Aaron his brother, his aſſiſtant in the arduous taſk. Mutually ſupporting each other, the Lord was with them. Happy for them, and thrice happy for the people, they were united by the moſt endearing ties, when placed, the one a political, the other an eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical leader. Aiming at the ſame great object, under the particular direction of Heaven, they went on, hand in hand, through a ſeries of unexampled trials, conducting and protecting their charge, as faithful ſhepherds guide their flocks. Connected with an ingrateful people, thoſe worthies met with ſingular difficulties in their way, were cenſured when performing the will of God, and exerting every power to advance the beſt intereſt of ſociety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:032640_0006_0FF3E2511FBC0DD0"/>JETHRO, the prieſt of Midian, father-in-law to Moſes, anxious for his ſon's welfare, and ſenſible that his taſk was inſupportable, propoſed ſome alterations, that a part of the burden might be removed from him, and placed upon others. Theſe we have in the theme under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration—the manner of executing their ſeveral truſts ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied—the extent of their power defined—and, in caſes of intricacy, an appeal open to the chief magiſtrate, their laſt reſort. Here the privileges of the people were in a great meaſure to be ſecured by the amiable characters of their rulers, and eſpecially by his who was their ſupreme judge, and under the immediate influence of the King of kings.</p>
            <p>THIS was the form of Government then eſtabliſhed. It was a theocracy; and its permanency ſhews it was ſuited to the genius of the people in that period of the world, as it continued in the days of Moſes, Joſhua, and till Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el's time, ſanctioned with the approbation of Heaven.— They were governed by wiſe judges, given them by a God who was their guardian and friend, till his favour was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited by a revolt from him, caſting off his authority, and determining to have a king of their own, in imitation of the heathen nations. This conduct proceeding from a fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diſpoſition, was diſpleaſing to God. Yet he granted their requeſt, gave them a king—but a king in judgment.</p>
            <p>THE Oracles of Truth are not deciſive, reſpecting any particular, permanent form of civil polity. We are left at liberty to adopt rules and laws agreeable to our inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In a ſtate of ignorance and barbariſm, a deſpotic power may be neceſſary; but where knowledge is diffuſed, and reaſon enlightened, the baſtile bars are ſeen—the ſhackles eluded.</p>
            <p>A REPUBLICAN Government, as defined by an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent writer, "in which all men, rich and poor, magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032640_0007_0FF3E1392AD583E0"/>
and ſubjects, officers and people, maſters and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, the firſt citizen and the laſt, are equally ſubject to the laws," is doubtleſs the moſt unexceptionable. This is the general principle which ſupports the Government of United America, happily removed from that monarchy, ariſtocracy, or democracy, which have injured mankind. This form has the public good for its principal object. It reſts primarily in the hands of the people; and when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated, is exerciſed a limited period, and returns to its origin. A people with a good conſtitution, judicious laws, in the hands of an executive authority influenced by the maxims of wiſdom and goodneſs, attentive to their true intereſt, will acquire ſtrength and ſtability, as they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in knowledge and virtue.</p>
            <p>THE directions given in my text, are adapted to any people, under whatever form of Government, when wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and probity are their guide. And in this view, we truſt they are peculiarly applicable to the people of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, and demand attention in all our elections to fill the offices of State, ſupreme and ſubordinate. Though under diſſimilar forms, electors may be different, yet the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the elected ſhould be the ſame.</p>
            <p>THE ſubject before us exhibits the duty of a people in the choice of their rulers, and delineates the leading traits eſſential to thoſe in public office.</p>
            <p>I SHALL attempt to make ſome obſervations upon the ſeveral particulars here ſpecified, to form good rulers— ſpeak of the duties of their ſtation—then draw ſome infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences—and conclude with addreſſes ſuited to the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>THE firſt particular in the choice of rulers, ſhould be natural abilities. Able men, are ſuch as have been diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed

by the God of nature. As in the eccleſiaſtical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, a novice is excluded; ſo in the civil, men of ſenſe and judgment are to be preferred. Men of fortitude, of reſolution, who fear not the faces of the unprincipled; but when occaſion requires, can oppoſe them with firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Men of clear heads, and determined hearts. But it is not enough that men ſhould have natural endowments; more is neceſſary. The gifts of nature ſhould be improved by ſtudy and cloſe application, and truth inveſtigated in the paths of ſcience. There ſhould be a general knowledge of the principles of natural and political law. And without this, men are expoſed; they are eaſily deceived, and led into errors, diſgraceful to themſelves, and injurious to their conſtituents. Deſigning individuals have every advantage of the illiterate, to influence their conduct to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of ſiniſter purpoſes.—A good natural under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, therefore, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> decent and liberal acquirements, are neceſſary ingredients in the able ſtateſman.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER qualification in an accompliſhed ruler here recommended, is the fear of GOD. This being granted, an atheiſt can have no part or lot in this matter. A being who is believed not to exiſt, cannot be feared.—But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, there are thoſe in an enlightened age of the world, who acknowledge the being of GOD, and yet are not afraid to offend him by trampling on his authority. Such are poorly qualified for eminent ſtations in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. An important trait in the character of a good ruler, is wanting.</p>
            <p>THE fear of God is the beſt guard againſt temptations to a deviation from the rules of right. By this, human paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are regulated, and men are influenced to "run the ways of God's commandments, rendering to all their dues —tribute to whom tribute is due, cuſtom to whom cuſtom,

fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour." A conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of his omnipreſence to whom we are all account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, fixes a laſting impreſſion upon the heart, fans every ſpark of moral rectitude, and calls forth patriotic exertions. The belief of an entire dependance on him, is an impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable mound againſt an inundation of immoralities. It is the beſt conſtructed fortreſs againſt the ſavage artillery of the prince of darkneſs.—Shielded with a helmet from the God of armies, the intrepid ruler marches at the head of his battalions, with prudence, fortitude, and perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which inſure protection, and lead on to victory.— Examples of wiſdom and virtue, originating from the fear of God, have a commanding influence upon the human mind; and in all our elections, ſuch qualifications ſhould invariably direct our choice.</p>
            <p>WE paſs on to a third particular eſſential in Jethro's rulers.—They were to be men of truth.</p>
            <p>POSSESSED of a principle oppoſed to falſehood and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, they were to be eminent for their integrity. This was a qualification neceſſary in the law-givers of Iſrael. To a man of this deſcription, "his yea, and nay, are Amen." His tongue is a faithful index of his mind. He ſtrictly obſerves the words of inſpiration, "Wherefore, putting away lying, ſpeak every man truth with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour." Senſible that he is always in the preſence of the God of truth, he never allowedly deviates from its laws. Such a character, the more it is examined, the more illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious it will appear. It will be "like the path of the juſt," po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>ONE thing more, neceſſary for accompliſhed rulers.— They ſhould hate covetouſneſs.</p>

               </gap> who fears God, and has a ſacred regard to truth. A principle of virtue is diſcovered, in a generous diſregard to perſonal wealth, when it comes in competition with the intereſt of the public. When a good ruler is engaged in his office, his duty to the ſtation arreſts his firſt attention; ſelf, has only a ſecondary place in his mind. When called to act in public, he leaves his private concerns behind him; they drop, till he has faithfully performed his higher engagements.—Preſuming that the electors in this State for the preſent year, ſo far as they have proceeded, have been actuated by the foregoing principles; that they have provided able men, fearers of God, men of truth, haters of covetouſneſs, to compoſe the preſent Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Aſſembly—let us proceed to offer a few thoughts upon the duties annexed to the truſt repoſed in them.</p>
            <p>IT was the advice of Jethro to Moſes, that the propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed characters ſhould be placed over the people, to be rulers of thouſands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of tens. With great propriety this may be applied to the ſeveral officers of a Republic, in a ſucceſſion, from the firſt magiſtrate.—The Federal and State Governments in America, have furniſhed us with conſtitutions and laws, by which the duties peculiar to each office are aſcertained. Our laws, however, are not like thoſe of the Medes and Perſians, which cannot be altered. The people have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a right to the exerciſe of their power, as the public intereſt may require. And may we not affirm, that in theory there is no Government ſo rational as where elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are frequent, the elected under the public eye, and to continue during the people's pleaſure? This is a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege we enjoy. Our annual elections give us an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032640_0011_0FF3E2605EA1D3D0"/>
to ſelect our beſt citizens to tranſact our public and moſt important buſineſs, to enact new laws, and make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments according to the exigencies of the State.</p>
            <p>A GENERAL Aſſembly to a Republic, in many reſpects ſtands in the place of a Moſes to Iſrael; the refulgence of whoſe virtues ſhould reſemble the face of Moſes, after he had received the law of the Lord on Mount Sinai. The Authority of a State is to provide men duly qualified to act in the neceſſary departments. The reins of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are to be given into their hands for thoſe purpoſes. Their truſt is important, and when they are under the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of an oath, they are bound by the ſtrongeſt ties: By them, the duties of every office ſhould be contemplated previous to a choice. And any ſtation had better remain vacant, than be improperly filled.—Thoſe paſſages of inſpiration will always remain true, "When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice; but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn." "He that ruleth over men muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God."</p>
            <p>A CONSCIENTIOUS regard to the principles of recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in general, and a ſtrict adherence to the duties an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to each office, either in the legiſlative or executive, whether relative to the civil, military, or eccleſiaſtical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, inſtamp upon it a dignity, by which the vicious are reſtrained, and the virtuous encouraged. In ſhort, the duties incumbent upon mankind, relative to their God and each other, obligatory upon all, and thoſe peculiarly adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the various offices in a well regulated Government, will be regarded with undiverted attention by every man deſerving public confidence.</p>
            <p>PERMIT me to enumerate ſome of the objects which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally preſent themſelves to the mind of the wiſe guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of a country.—The moſt perfect body of human

laws ever framed, have their defects; and theſe are made obvious by practice. In their operations, they in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects do not anſwer the deſigns propoſed. Wiſe legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, upon a diſcovery of imperfections, by which the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens are embarraſſed or wronged, by which any claſs of men are injured, will exert themſelves for a reformation, and not give over the purſuit till it be accompliſhed. As they are the guardians of the people, fidelity to their truſt demands their attention. Laws ſhould be founded upon the principles of reaſon and juſtice—ſhould be few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, perſpicuous, and punctually executed. Thoſe which have been made, and are now in force, ought they not to be made plain and intelligible? Might not perplexities, expences, and great injuſtice, be prevented, and ſociety highly favoured?—Explicit laws, binding mankind to the rules of juſtice, are an admirable ſecurity to all branches of ſociety. Under them, contracts are valid, peaceable members of the community are protected in the enjoyment of their intereſts, the profligate reſtrained and puniſhed, and in a ſenſe the "wrath of man is made to praiſe God."</p>
            <p>A FREQUANT reviſion of the laws and conſtitutions of a country, with ſuch alterations as good policy may ſuggeſt, promotes that general utility which cements the various parts of ſociety, and forms a complete harmonious whole.</p>
            <p>AGAIN.—An important object in the minds of good rulers, is, the increaſe of uſeful knowledge.</p>
            <p>A FOUNDATION placed in the minds of youth, is like "good ſeed ſown in good ground," in its proper ſeaſon; and gives the faireſt proſpects of a happy increaſe to the well being of ſociety. The principles of virtue and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge early implanted, naturally take root, and produce a luxuriant harveſt. Thoſe who are thus favoured, are "trained up in the way they ſhould go," the beſt promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

on life's devious journey.—Hence the propriety of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able inſtructors, whoſe morals and language are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of imitation. And hence the neceſſity of giving ample encouragement, in a buſineſs ſo important and laborious. Though honourable donations have been made for the promotion of literature, yet the foſtering hand of our civil fathers may be required for bringing to maturity. May it not then be expected, that every aid and encouragement will be given to education? The views of ſuch as are young, are hereby extended; they are raiſed above the grovelling vulgariſms too common to that age, which will have a happy influence upon ſociety, in preparing the riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generation to fill with honour the moſt dignified ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when they may be called to act upon the theatre of life.</p>
            <p>Is there not a third and an important object in the mind of rulers, viz. the increaſe of virtue and religion?</p>
            <p>THE ideas which have by ſome been adopted, that the civil authority ſhould never interpoſe in matters of religion, are erroneous. It is granted by the moſt learned politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, that the religious forms which have been eſtabliſhed and ſupported, have had a powerful tendency to promote civility, to reſtrain vicious men, to protect the innocent, to countenance worthy purſuits, and to diſcountenance the immoralities which have contaminated mankind! Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this nature have flowed from knowledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. And if they be well founded, is it not a truth, that eſtabliſhments of this kind invite the attention that civil policy which is the ſupport of Government? If therefore, virtue and religion form the principal pillar which upholds the civil ſabrick, it is evidently a duty for wiſe rulers to contribute ſomething for its ſupport. Upon this principle, many profeſſed deiſts contribute with cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and liberality to public teachers of morality; they
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032640_0014_0FF3E26BAAE644F0"/>
are patrons to the worſhip of God in goſpel order. They have conſidered it as a meaſure wiſely adapted to uphold Government—and in this they deſerve an encomium.</p>
            <p>SUCH as fully believe the Chriſtian religion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Scriptures as the Word of God, have additional motives for their utmoſt exertions that ſobriety and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may be promoted. It is indiſputable, that the more a ſociety live in the practice of virtue, the greater proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they enjoy: The more they are under the influence of vicious principles, the more unhappineſs they will expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. The ſacred Oracles give us the beſt directions. In them, no unreaſonable reſtraints are impoſed, no ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional enjoyments are forbidden. Exceſs alone is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. So far as the Scriptures are ſtrictly regarded, ſo far every member of the community conducts with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety. The various propenſities and paſſions peculiar to human nature, are directed to right objects. And there, <hi>CHRIST,</hi> a moſt faithful and compaſſionate legiſlator, ſtands, giving law to his ſubjects. In thoſe records, his character is exhibited, his maxims are regiſtered, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample left for our imitation; and the whole perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable to virtue, religion, and the beſt policy. Thence may be extracted wiſdom and inſtruction to guide us into the paths of rectitude; to ſave us from deſtructive courſes of error and deluſion. Here is a conſtitution worthy the particular notice of every man who holds an office in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; that under the influence of its rules, he may be inſtrumental in diffuſing virtuous and benevolent prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Directed by this, he will give his public teſtimony in favour of thoſe who are engaged profeſſionally to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare mankind for bleſſings in this life, and a glorious fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reward.</p>
            <p>ONE farther eſſential in good rulers, is, that they are themſelves exemplary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:032640_0015_0FF3E26D2F7E7668"/>THERE can be no greater burleſque upon the character of rulers, than when, under binding obligations to God, and their conſtituents, they are making laws which they are the firſt in violating!—But how agreeable are the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, when judicious laws are made, are eſteemed ſacred, and are punctually obſerved by the enactors? A ſanction is hereby placed upon them, which impreſſes every mind. And ſocieties having their eye upon their rulers, obſerving their conſiſtency, are led to follow their example, which naturally tends to rectify the vices and to reform the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the community. When precept and example are harmonious in rulers, every obſerver is charmed with the character; when they are at variance, they cannot fail to produce contempt. Of great importance then it muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, for thoſe who are clothed with authority, to have the qualifications deſcribed in my text, to be themſelves exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary, and let their light ſhine before men, who, aiming at one great object, the beſt intereſt of the public, are fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with preſent animation; and their views, not confined to this life, are extended, and terminate in immortality.</p>
            <p>THE diſcourſe ſhall be cloſed with an improvement— and with addreſſes ſuited to the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>THE ſuggeſtions which have been given, exhibit the neceſſity of a Government eſtabliſhed upon the principles of reaſon, and guarded by the maxims of juſtice and virtue. The paſſions natural to men, indicate that we were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſociety—and they powerfully excite us to enter into ſocial connections. From a ſtate of natural equality, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities are formed. The infirmities of men require pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection—their vices, reſtraints and puniſhment. A free Government, therefore, under which the virtuous are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and the vicious puniſhed, is the palladium of the rational mind. How important, then, that it ſhould be ſupported; that every aid ſhould be given to thoſe who

               </gap>te the liberties and privileges of a people.—An unreſtrained authority is dangerous; witneſs Hazael, Haman, and the unfortunate Charles. Extremes are always attended with conſequences moſt unfavourable. Tyranny and anarchy, equally pernicious! An oppoſition to good Government is inexcuſable, as it "reſiſts an ordinance of God." A tame ſubmiſſion to an unjuſt authority, diſcovers a puſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity derogatory to the human mind.—Wherever a juſt Government is wanting, as an "hidden treaſure" it ſhould be ſought and eſtabliſhed. Where it hath been enjoyed, and is become deficient, it ſhould be carefully amended, as was before hinted. Too great efforts cannot be made to uphold and perpetuate a well-founded Government— and continued exertions will facilitate its riſing in reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability.</p>
            <p>FROM the ideas which have been brought into view, may not the people of America felicitate themſelves under our preſent forms of Government, and in the general cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of our rulers, eſpecially thoſe in exalted ſtations? Though we may not be favoured with ſupreme magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates who have an immediate intercourſe with Heaven, as had Moſes the law-giver of Iſrael; yet we may preſume that they have been, and are, favoured with the approving preſence of God.</p>
            <p>OUR conſtitutions of Government, though they may be imperfect, ſtand high in the eſtimation of the enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and impartial among the nations of the earth: And under them, we have reaſon to rejoice in a general proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.

            <p>SHALL we not ſpend a moment in contraſting our preſent circumſtances in a ſtate of peace, with what we experienced when involved in the horrors of war?—in contraſting our ſituation, with many of the European na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whoſe garments are now ſtained with human blood? —Let us read the hiſtory of the French revolution, and we ſhall have additional reaſon to rejoice in God for his favours, and in the language of inſpiration muſt ſay, "hitherto hath the Lord helped US."</p>
            <p>AGAIN.—From the reflections we have been making, we learn the advantages of a virtuous Government.—If we look into the ſacred hiſtory, we find the proſperity of Iſrael ebbing and flowing with the morality of their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns. When they had good kings, heavy judgments were averted; but when their rulers were vicious, they

forſook the Lord, ran into idolatry, expoſed themſelves, and judgments came upon them like a flood! They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo abandoned, that God ſaid of them by his prophet, "Though Moſes and Samuel ſtood before me, my heart could not be towards this people; caſt them out of my ſight, and let them go forth."</p>
            <p>AND hath it not been generally true, that ignorance, a neglect of God and his worſhip, idleneſs, luxury, diſſolute manners, and factions, have been certain preludes to the deſtruction of States and Empires? Is not this abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved by the hiſtories of ancient times? Was not this verified in the deſtruction of Sparta, Athens, Rome?— And if we may reaſon from paſt events, we may ſafely preſume, that like cauſes will produce ſimilar effects, however WE may be involved in the iſſue.</p>
            <p>THOUGH it pleaſes God not to reward or puniſh indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals in this life, according to their merit or demerit, as appears by the hiſtories of the Prophets and Apoſtles, by the parable of Dives and Lazarus, by the proſperity of Nero, and the misfortunes of LOUIS; yet Heaven hath balanced national virtue by affluence, and vice by a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe of adverſity. Nothing, then, can be a greater ſtimulus to a virtuous Government, to adopt the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergetic meaſures, that religion and every ſpecies of virtue may be encouraged. On the other hand, that vice, with its baneful retinue, and whatever may be derogatory to the citizen, the ſtateſman, or the chriſtian, may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced, and meet with an exemplary puniſhment! —The officers of Government have a price put into their hands, to promote the intereſt of their brethren, and the common cauſe of virtue.

            <p>AFTER a ſeries of ſignal interpoſitions, the inhabitants of this land are placed upon the ſhores of Freedom, with the olive branch flouriſhing in their hands. Heroes in the field, wiſe men at the head of the civil polity, with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing intercourſe with Heaven, have brought on the preſent Aera. For years paſt, no nation ever experienced greater proſperity. "The voice of joy and health have been heard in our habitations;" the earth hath teemed with a profuſion of rich treaſures; "the little hills have rejoiced on every ſide."</p>
            <p>ARTS and Sciences have flouriſhed; and a ſpirit of enterprize, before unknown in the annals of our country,

hath been diſplayed, not in opening deep waters, that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers may go through dry ſhod, but in providing ſafe paſſages over them; and alſo to divert the watery element into different channels, to facilitate the labours of men.— Perhaps no period was ever ſo favourable for the general increaſe of property, as what we are now experiencing.</p>
            <p>THIS life is a changing ſcene. Proſperity and adverſity await mankind, under the ſuperintendency of unetring wiſdom. Though we have been a highly privileged people, this may not continue. Proſperity too often produces luxury, which leads to a decay of virtue, to irreligion, and ruin.—May Heaven divert our feet from paths ſo danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and lead us on in the way of truth and ſafety.

This is verified by late experience—by the retirement of our worthy Chief Magiſtrate, at a critical period; and the choice of a ſucceſſor, whoſe paſt eminent ſervices have given him the beſt title to public confidence. Calls of this nature ſhould be improved to awaken our vigilance, that we may obtain a true knowledge of the moſt deſerving, and of thoſe of a contrary deſcription; that our future proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings may be conſonant to the principles of reaſon and ſound policy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:032640_0022_0FF3E28518B4CC70"/>MAY the Great Superintendent give wiſdom to our Supreme Government at their preſent ſeſſion, in tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the higheſt moment to the States of America— that prudence, fortitude, and unanimity, may mark eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry movement, and inſtamp a dignity upon our national character. With a rational confidence in that authority, under God, we reſt our political ſafety.—We rely upon their wiſdom and integrity.</p>
            <p>PRESUMING that we ſhall not be deceived, we ſhall ever be ready to ſupport Government, to reward all who are faithfully diſcharging the duties of their ſtations, from thoſe who are rulers of thouſands, to ſuch as are only rulers of tens.</p>
            <p>UPON a reflection, that we have all a part to act in the drama of life, our minds cannot but be impreſſed; that our ſeveral ſtations require various exerciſes! "That though on earth the powers that be are ordained of God," and cannot be diſregarded but by incurring the divine diſpleaſure; yet we are accountable to Higher Powers, and ere long muſt aſſemble at the Bar of the Great Judge of all the earth!</p>
            <p>KEEPING that ſolemn period ever in view, let us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our parts in life with a cheerful ſeriouſneſs, as in the preſence of an Omniſcient God. With lives regulated by the maxims of truth, by the illuminations of the divine ſpirit, let us "run the ways of God's commandments," diſſeminating light and knowledge, till we are prepared to enter into a world of glory, where virtue alone will digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy and exalt every immortal ſpirit, in the immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, of the Redeemer, in the ſociety of Angelic Hoſts and innumerable glorified Saints—where one chorus of praiſe ſhall commence, progreſs in ceaſeleſs ages, and ſubordinate power be abſorbed in Heaven's Sovereign.</p>
