            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE motto of this paper gives a ſpecimen of Roman, the proceedings againſt America, of Engliſh policy.—There is, and muſt neceſſarily be, a compact, either expreſs, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, between every ſovereign and ſubject. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and obedience are the mutual ſtipulations, if the one is withdrawn, the other ceaſes. Now, protection is certainly withdrawn, when ſubjects, guilty of no hoſtile or rebellious act, (I defy the miniſtry to prove one againſt them) are neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs treated (like the Americans) as enemies and rebels. Adminiſtration, moſt falſely and auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, ſtigmatize them with the name of rebels, merely to colour their own baſe deſigns, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:013982_0002_0F925989A5B5ABD8"/>hoſtilities againſt their fellow-ſubjects; in whom they diſcern an odious ſpirit of liberty, which ſets (for them) a dangerous example to the mother country. The noble flame is dying here, and it would be fatal to miniſterial deſigns, that it ſhould be cheriſhed in any part of our dominions.</p>
            <p>The ſpirited Americans feel this truth, they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, and wiſely guard againſt the danger. They have convened, and conſulted for the public ſafety, like true Britons. What then? Is ſuch a national, political congreſs, a traiterous aſſociation? At ſuch a time too, and in ſuch a cauſe? Is the ſituation and circumſtances of America (a nation in point of territory and numbers) to be compared to that of Truro (a rotten borough) in Cornwall? Buffoonery in ſerious caſes, Doctor Johnſon, diſhonours human nature, and degrades human underſtanding. Not even the example of your maſter, Doctor, who played Falſtaff, after he had deluded a late unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Lord Chancellor of England into ſuicide, can ſanctify dramatic pleaſantry, at the expence of life, liberty, property, and a whole country.</p>
            <p>"Kill the next Piercy yourſelf," my lord, is a ſpecies of drollery, in a caſe of blood, unworthy even of a hackney writer; as to you, Doctor John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,—I do not expect you will write honeſtly, but write ſenſibly. Treat ſubjects, (which might even affect the humanity of a Scotchman) no more lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrouſly, indecently, unfeelingly, and abandonly. With your leave, Doctor, I once more call Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica a nation, and a great nation; too far diſtant from her mother country, to receive from her either
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:013982_0003_0F92598A3ABFF678"/>colonies, Thus, (ſays Dr. Johnſon) they have defrauded their creditors here, and condemned our merchants to bankruptcy. If creditors and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants ſuffer, if manufacturers complain, they muſt recur to the firſt cauſe. Theſe are the pernicious effects of the wiſe ſteps, taken firſt by the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial aggreſſors in this country. Nor is it to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at, if the conſequence of theſe raſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt proceedings by the harpies of power, ſhould produce (in caſe of an approaching war with France and Spain) a general bankruptcy of this nation.— A thought by no means chimerical, but truly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy; a thought, which can neither be baffled by the buffoonery of hackney ſcribblers, the grave ſarcaſms of ſtateſmen, or the cruel pleaſantry of thoughtleſs Majeſty itſelf.</p>
