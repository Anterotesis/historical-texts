            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE favourable reception given to the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect account of the fever which I lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and the particular deſire of ſome of my friends, have induced me to undertake a more ſatisfactory hiſtory of it, in order to collect together, while facts are recent, as many of the moſt intereſting occurrences as I could, for the information of the public.</p>
            <p>I have not attempted any embelliſhment or ornament of ſtile; but have alone aimed at tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling plain truths in plain language. For the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultory plan of ſome part of the pamphlet, I have to offer the following apology; many of the circumſtances and reflexions towards the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which would have come with more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in the beginning, did not occur, until ſome of the firſt half ſheets were not only writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but printed. I had no choice, therefore,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025255_0004_0FCCD937857F4D88"/>
but either to omit them, or place them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what out of order.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the facts mentioned have fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my own obſervation. Thoſe of a different deſcription I have been aſſiduous to collect from every perſon of credibility, poſſeſſed of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>Deſirous of having this account correct and complete, I have printed off but a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of copies of the preſent edition: and ſhall eſteem myſelf moſt particularly obliged to any perſon who will be ſo kind to point out errors, to be corrected in, or ſuggeſt facts, to be added to, a new edition, which I propoſe to put to preſs very ſoon, and which will, I hope, be found ſtill more ample than the preſent one.</p>

            <head>A BRIEF ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>BEFORE I enter on the conſideration of this diſorder, it may not be improper to offer a few introductory remarks on the ſituation of Philadelphia previous to its commencement, which will reflect light on ſome of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances mentioned in the courſe of the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
            <p>The manufactures, trade, and commerce of Philadelphia had, for a conſiderable time, been improving and extending with great rapidity. From the period of the adoption of the federal government, at which time we were at the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ebb of diſtreſs, our ſituation had progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively become more and more proſperous. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, formerly baniſhed, was univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. Property of every kind, roſe to, and in
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:025255_0006_0FCCED4328BC1DA8"/>
ſome inſtances beyond, its real value<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a few revolving years exhibited the intereſting ſpectacle of a young country, with a new form of government, emerging from a ſtate approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very near to anarchy, and acquiring all the ſtability and nerve of the beſt-toned and oldeſt nations.</p>
            <p>In this proſperity, which revived the hopes of four millions of people, Philadelphia participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in an eminent degree. New houſes, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every ſtreet, built in a very neat, elegant ſtile, adorned, at the ſame time that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged the city. Its population was extending faſt. Houſe rent had riſen to a moſt extravagant height; it was in many caſes double, and in ſome treble what it had been a year or two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and, as is generally the caſe, when a city is thriving, it went far beyond the real increaſe of trade. The number of applicants for houſes, exceeding the number of houſes to be let, one bid over another; and affairs were in ſuch a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that many people, though they had a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable run of buſineſs, could hardly do more than clear their rents, and were, literally, toiling for
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025255_0007_0FCCED45084A8730"/>
their landlords alone<note n="*" place="bottom">The diſtreſs ariſing from this ſoure, was perhaps the only exception to the general obſervation of the flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſituation of Philadelphia.</note>. Luxury, the uſual, and perhaps inevitable concomitant of proſperity, was gaining ground in a manner very alarming to thoſe who conſidered how far the virtue, the liberty, and the happineſs of a nation depend on their temperance and ſober manners. Men had been for ſome time in the habit of regulating their expenſes by proſpects formed in ſanguine hours, when every probability was caught at as a certainty, not by their actual profits, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. The number of coaches, coachees, chairs, &amp;c. lately ſet up by men in the middle rank of life, is hardly credible. And although there had been a very great increaſe of hackney chairs, yet it was hardly ever poſſible to procure one on a Sunday, unleſs it was engaged two or three days before. Extravagance, in various ſhapes, was gradually eradicating the plain and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome habits of the city. And although it were preſumption to attempt to ſcan the decrees of heaven, yet few, I believe, will pretend to deny,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025255_0008_0FCCED46E62044E8"/>
that ſomething was wanting to humble the pride of a city, which was running on in full ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, to the goal of prodigality and diſſipation.</p>
            <p>However, from November 1792, to the end of laſt June, the difficulties of Philadelphia were extreme. The eſtabliſhment of the bank of Pennſylvania, in embryo for the moſt part of that time, had arreſted in the other banks ſuch a quantity of the circulating ſpecie, as embarraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed almoſt every kind of buſineſs; to this was added the diſtreſs ariſing from the very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous failures in England, which had extremely harraſſed ſeveral of our capital merchants. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this period, many men experienced as great difficulties as were ever known in this city<note n="§" place="bottom">It is with great pleaſure, I embrace this opportunity of declaring, that the very liberal conduct of the bank of the united ſtates, at this trying ſeaſon, was the means of ſaving many a deſerving and induſtrious man from ruin.</note>. But the opening, in July, of the bank of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, conducted on the moſt liberal princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, placed buſineſs on its former favourable
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:025255_0009_0FCCED4B7ABDC3F8"/>
footing. Every man looked forward to this fall as likely to produce a vaſt extenſion of trade. But how fleeting are all human views! how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain all plans founded on earthly appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces! All theſe flattering proſpects vaniſhed like the baſeleſs fabric of a viſion.</p>
            <p>In July, arrived the unfortunate fugitives from Cape François. And on this occaſion, the liberality of Philadelphia was diſplayed in a moſt reſpectable point of light. Nearly 12,000 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars were in a few days collected for their relief. Little, alas! did many of the contributors, then in eaſy circumſtances, imagine, that a few weeks would leave their wives and children dependent on the public charity, as has ſince unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happened. An awful inſtance of the rapid and warning viciſſitudes of affairs on this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory ſtage.</p>
            <p>At this time, the deſtroying ſcourge crept in among us, and nipped in the bud the faireſt bloſſoms that imagination could form. And, oh! what dreadful contraſt has ſince taken place! Many of our firſt commercial houſes are totally diſſolved, by the death of the parties,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:025255_0010_0FCCED4D0B6ABEA8"/>
and their affairs are neceſſarily left in ſo derang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſtate that the loſſes and diſtreſſes which muſt take place, are beyond eſtimation. The proteſts of notes for a few weeks paſt, have been beyond all former example; for moſt of the principal merchants having left the city, and been totally unable, from the ſtagnation of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and diverſion of all their expected reſources, to make any proviſion for payment, many of their notes have been proteſted, as they became due. The bank of the united ſtates, paſſed, on the 15th of October, a reſolve, empowering their caſhier to renew all diſcounted notes, when the ſame drawers and indorſers were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and declaring that no notes ſhould be proteſted, when the indorſers bound themſelves in writing, to be acountable in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as in caſes of proteſt.</p>
            <p>Beſides what we have already ſuffered, we are menaced with another evil, which proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at any other period, would not very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially injure the city; but if it comes in addition to our preſent diſtreſs, will operate againſt us a very long time. I mean the removal of congreſs. The meeting of this body is fixed for the firſt
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:025255_0011_0FCCED4E5B747910"/>
Monday in December; and it is not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that attempts will be made to prevent their next ſeſſion being held here. Appeals will be made to their fears. Already the New York pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers announce,
<q>that as congreſs cannot meet, agreeably to their adjournment, with any probability of ſafety in Philadelphia, under its preſent calamitous viſitation, there can be no doubt of their adjourning to ſit in New York, where the air is perfectly ſalubrious, the markets plentiful, and every conveniency ready for their accommodation<note n="*" place="bottom">Columbian Gazetteer, October 17, 1793.</note>.</q>
If, at the time of their meeting, any trace of the diſorder remains, the Philadelphians will not urge their ſtay here. But if it be, as there is every probability, abſolutely extinguiſhed, we place too much reliance on their juſtice to ſuſpect that they will add to the ſtroke we have felt.</p>
            <p>For theſe prefatory obſervations I hope I ſhall be pardoned. I now proceed to the melancholy ſubject I have undertaken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:025255_0012_0FCCED4FE5E8BA28"/>The malignant fever, which has committed ſuch ravages in Philadelphia, made its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance here, about the end of July. Dr. Hodge's child, probably the firſt victim, was taken ill on the 26th or 27th of July, and died on the 6th or 7th of Auguſt. A Mr. Moore<note n="*" place="bottom">This man had been walking along the wharves, where the coffee lay, and at which the Sans Culottes was moored, in the morning; and on his return home, was ſo extremely ill, as to be obliged to go to bed, from which he never roſe again.</note>, in Mr. Denny's lodging houſe, in Water ſtreet, was ſeized on Friday, the 2d of Auguſt, and died on Sunday, the fourth. Mrs. Parkinſon, who lodged in the ſame houſe, caught the diſorder, on the 3d of Auguſt, and died on the 7th.</p>
            <p>On the origin of the diſorder, there prevails a very great diverſity of opinion. Dr. Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon maintained that it was not imported, and ſtated, in a letter which he wrote on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Captain Falconer, the health officer of the port of Philadelphia, that
<q>the general opinion was, that the diſorder originated from ſome damaged coffee, or other putrified vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and animal matters.</q>
To this opinion,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:025255_0013_0FCCED52C8F7FD70"/>
though he did not give it abſolutely as his own, he ſeemed ſtrongly to incline; and mentioned, that at a wharf, a little above Arch-ſtreet, there was not only a quantity of damaged cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſtench of this coffee was ſo exceſſively offenſive, that the people in the neighbourhood could hardly bear to remain in the back part of their houſes.</note>, extremely offenſive, but alſo ſome putrid animal and vegetable ſubſtances. The doctor reſted his opinion, that the diſorder was not imported, on two circumſtances, which prove to be miſtaken, viz. that no foreigners or ſailors were infected on the 27th of Auguſt, the time of writing, and that it had not been found in lodging houſes. This opinion was ſo far from being juſt, that the ſecond place in which it is known to have made its appearance, was a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſe, and ſome of the earlieſt patients were French lads.</p>
            <p>Dr. Ruſh is of the ſame opinion with dr. Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinſon, and ſays he has in his poſſeſſion ſufficient documents to prove that the diſorder is not an imported one, but of native growth. As he has
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025255_0014_0FCCED53A136AF80"/>
not yet communicated his proofs to the public, it is impoſſible to decide on them.</p>
            <p>That it is an imported diſorder, is the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of moſt of the inhabitants of Philadelphia. However, there is much diverſity of ſentiment, as to the time and manner of its introduction. I ſhall ſtate ſome of the various reports current, and let the reader judge for himſelf.</p>
            <p>Some aſſert, that it was brought by Il Conſtante, commanded by Coulon, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived here from Raguſa, and Martinico, about the beginning of May. This is very unlikely, as the lower part of the city, where ſhe lay, was free until the diſorder ſpread there from the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part.</p>
            <p>Another opinion is, that it was introduced by the Mary, captain Ruſh, which arrived here on the 7th of Auguſt, with ſome of the French emigrants from the cape. But the exiſtence of the diſorder previous to her arrival, ſets aſide this opinion at once.</p>
            <p>Others again ſay that a veſſel from Tobago<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:025255_0015_0FCCED552AB00E08"/>
which arrived here in July, loſt nearly all her hands with a malignant fever. In the river, ſhe ſhipped freſh hands, many of whom died. From her they believe the diſorder ſpread. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to this report, I cannot aver any thing.</p>
            <p>The moſt probable and general opinion is, that the privateer Sans Culottes, with her prize, the Flora, which arrived here the 22d of July, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the fever. The privateer was in a foul, dirty condition—her hold very ſmall—and perhaps as ill calculated for the accommodation of the great number of people that were on board, as any veſſel that ever croſſed the ocean. All her ſilth was emptied at a wharf between Arch and Race-ſtreet. A dead body, ſewed up in canvaſs, lay on board the Flora, for ſome time, and was ſeen by mr. Lemaigre and other gentlemen. Several reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table inhabitants of Water-ſtreet declare, that ſundry dead bodies were privately landed in the night, from the privateer and her prize.</p>
            <p>Before I diſmiſs this part of the ſubject, it may not be amiſs to mention, that many believe we have had two diſorders in the city, introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced about the ſame time, the yellow fever, from
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:025255_0016_0FCCED56DC534820"/>
the Weſt Indies, and a ſpecies of peſtilence from Marſeilles.</p>
            <p>The mortality began about that part of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſtreet, where the Sans Culottes lay. For ſome time it was entirely confined to that place and its neighbourhood. Almoſt every death which occurred in the early ſtage of the diſorder could be without difficulty traced to that ſtreet. By degrees, it ſpread, owing to the want of precaution, and to communication with the infected. It is ſaid, and generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that the beds and bedding of thoſe who died of the diſorder, at firſt, before the alarm went abroad, were ſold, and ſpread it among the buyers.</p>
            <p>Several perſons were ſwept away before any great alarm was excited. The firſt deaths that attracted public notice, and ſtruck terror among the citizens, were thoſe of Peter Aſton, on the 19th, of Mrs. Lemaigre, on the 20th, and of Thomas Miller, on the 25th of Auguſt. About this time began the removals from the city, which were for ſome weeks ſo general, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every hour in the day, carts, waggons,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:025255_0017_0FCCED583B5C1F08"/>
coachees, and chairs, were to be ſeen tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing families and furniture to the country in every direction. Buſineſs then became extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dull. Mechanics and artiſts were unemployed; and the ſtreets wore the appearance of gloom and melancholy.</p>
            <p>The firſt official notice taken of the diſorder, was on the 22d of Auguſt, on which day, the mayor of Philadelphia, Matthew Clarkſon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſq. wrote to the city commiſſioners, and after ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting them with the ſtate of the city, gave them the moſt peremptory orders, to have the ſtreets properly cleanſed and purified by the ſcavengers, and all the filth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately hawled away. Theſe orders were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated on the 27th, and ſimilar ones given to the clerks of the market. The 29th the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the ſtate, in his addreſs to the legiſlature, acquainted them, that a contagious diſorder exiſted in the city; and that he had taken every proper meaſure to aſcertain the origin, nature, and extent of it. He likewiſe aſſured them that the health officer and phyſician of the port, would take every precaution to allay and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the public inquietude.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:025255_0018_0FCCED5998767B50"/>The 26th of the ſame month, the college of phyſicians had a meeting, at which they took into conſideration the nature of the diſorder, and the means of prevention and of cure. They publiſhed an addreſs to the citizens, ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the preſident and ſecretary, recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to avoid all unneceſſary intercourſe with the infected; to place marks on the doors or win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows where they were; to pay great attention to cleanlineſs and airing the rooms of the ſick; to provide a large and airy hoſpital in the neighbourhood of the city for their reception; to put a ſtop to the tolling of the bells; to bury thoſe who died of the diſorder in carriages and as privately as poſſible; to keep the ſtreets and wharves clean; to avoid all fatigue of body and mind, and ſtanding or ſitting in the ſun, or in the open air; to accommodate the dreſs to the weather, and to exceed rather in warm than in cool clothing; and to avoid intemperance, but to uſe fermented liquors, ſuch as wine, beer, and cider, with moderation. They likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their opinion, that fires in the ſtreets were very dangerous, if not ineffectual means of ſtopping the progreſs of the fever, and that they placed more dependence on the burning of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025255_0019_0FCCED5D514C63F8"/>
gunpowder. The benefits of vinegar and cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, they added, were confined chiefly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected rooms, and could not be too often uſed on handkerchiefs, or in ſmelling bottles, by perſons who attended the ſick.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of this addreſs, the bells were immediately ſtopped from tolling, which was a meaſure very expedient; as they had before been kept pretty conſtantly going the whole day, ſo as to terrify thoſe in health, and drive the ſick, as far as the influence of imagination could produce that effect, to their graves. An idea had gone abroad, that the burning of fires in the ſtreets, would have a tendency to purify the air, and arreſt the progreſs of the diſorder. The people had, therefore, almoſt every night large fires lighted at the corners of the ſtreets. The 29th, the mayor publiſhed a proclamation, forbidding this practice. As a ſubſtitute, many had recourſe to the firing of guns, which they imagined was a certain preventative of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. This was carried ſo far, and attended with ſuch danger, that it was forbidden by the mayor's order, of the 4th of September.</p>
            <p>The number of the infected daily increaſing,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:025255_0020_0FCCED5EEFAD0460"/>
and the exiſtence of an order againſt the admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of perſons labouring under infectious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes into the alms houſe, precluding them from a refuge there<note n="*" place="bottom">At this period, the number of paupers in the alms houſe was between three and four hundred; and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers, apprehenſive of ſpreading the diſorder among them, enforced the abovementioned order, which had been entered into along time before. They, however, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied beds and bedding, and all the money in their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, for their relief, out of that houſe.</note>, ſome temporary place was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, and thre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the guardians of the poor took poſſeſſion of the circus, in which mr. Ric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketts had lately exhibited his equeſtrian feats, being the only place that could be procured for the purpoſe. Thither they ſent ſeven perſons afflicted with the malignant fever, where they lay in the open air for ſome time, and without proper aſſiſtance<note n="†" place="bottom">High wages were offered for nurſes for theſe poor people—but none could be procured.</note>. Of theſe, one crawled out on the commons, where he died at a diſtance from any houſe. Two died in the circus, one of whom was ſeaſonably removed; the other lay in a ſtate of putrefaction for above forty eight hours, owing to the difficulty of procuring any perſon
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:025255_0021_0FCCED60618377C0"/>
to remove him. On this occaſion occurred an inſtance of courage in a ſervant girl, of which at that time few men were capable. The carter, who finally undertook to remove the corpſe, having no aſſiſtant, and being unable alone to put it into the coffin, was on the point of relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing his deſign, and quitting the place. The girl perceived him, and underſtanding the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty he laboured under, offered her ſervices, provided he would not inform the family with whom ſhe lived. She accordingly helped him to put the body into the coffin, which was by that time crawling with maggots, and in ſuch a ſtate as to be ready to fall in pieces. It gives me plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to add, that ſhe ſtill lives, notwithſtanding her very hazardous exploit.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of the neighbourhood of the circus took the alarm, and theatened to burn or deſtroy it, unleſs the ſick were removed; and it is believed they would have actually carried their threats into execution, had a compliance been delayed a day longer.</p>
            <p>The 29th, ſeven of the guardians of the poor had a conference with ſome of the city magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:025255_0022_0FCCED620BB5E108"/>
on the ſubject of the fever, at which it was agreed to be indiſpenſably neceſſary that a ſuitable houſe, as an hoſpital, ſhould be provided near the city for the reception of the infected poor.</p>
            <p>In conſequence, the ſame day, the guardians of the poor reſolved to uſe their utmoſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to procure ſuch a houſe out of town, and as near thereto, as might be practicable, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the ſafety of the inhabitants, for the poor who were or might be afflicted with conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſorders, and be deſtitute of the means of providing neceſſary aſſiſtance otherwiſe; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage phyſicians, nurſes, attendants, and all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for their relief in that houſe; to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point proper perſons in each diſtrict, to enquire after ſuch poor as might be afflicted; to adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſiſtance to them in their own houſes, and, if neceſſary, to remove them to the hoſpital. They reſerved to themſelves, at the ſame time, the liberty of calling on the mayor for ſuch ſums as might be neceſſary to carry their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves into effect.</p>
            <p>Conformably to theſe reſolves, a committee of
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:025255_0023_0FCCED6370BFA510"/>
the guardians was appointed to make enquiry for a ſuitable place; and after ſtrict examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they judged that a building adjacent to Buſhhill, the manſion houſe of William Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, eſq. was the beſt calculated for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And that gentleman being abſent, and having no agent in the city, and the great ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of the caſe admitting no delay, eight of the guardians, accompanied by Hilary Baker, eſq. one of the city aldermen, with the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the governor, proceeded to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had fixed upon; and meeting with ſome oppoſition from a tenant who occupied it, they took poſſeſſion of the manſion houſe itſelf, to which, on the ſame evening, the 31ſt of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, they ſent the four patients who remained at the circus.</p>
            <p>Shortly after this, the guardians of the poor for the city, except James Wilſon, Jacob Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, jun. and William Sanſom, ceaſed the performance of their duties, nearly the whole of them having removed out of the city. Before this virtual vacation of office, they paſſed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve againſt the admiſſion of any paupers what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever into the alms-houſe during the prevalence
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:025255_0024_0FCCED64DF528630"/>
of the diſorder. The cauſe of entering into this order, was, that ſome paupers, who had been admitted previous thereto, with a certificate from the phyſicians, of their being free from the infection, had nevertheleſs died of it. The whole care of the poor of the city, the providing for Buſh-hill, ſending the ſick there, and burying the dead, devolved, therefore, on the above three guardians. It muſt give the reader great ſorrow to hear, that two of them, James Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Jacob Tomkins, excellent and indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable young men, whoſe ſervices were at that time of very great importance, fell ſacrifices in the cauſe of humanity. The other, William San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, was likewiſe, in the execution of his dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous office, ſeized with the diſorder, and on the brink of the grave, but was ſo fortunate as to eſcape.</p>
            <p>The conſternation of the people of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia at this period was carried beyond all bounds. Diſmay and affright were viſible in the countenance of almoſt every perſon. Moſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who could by any means make it convenient, fled from the city. Of thoſe who remained, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhut themſelves up in their houſes, and were
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025255_0025_0FCCED66642259D8"/>
afraid to walk the ſtreets. The conſumption of gunpowder and nitre in houſes as a preventa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, was inconceivable. Many were almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly purifying, ſcowering, and whitewaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their rooms. Thoſe who ventured abroad, had handkerchiefs or ſponges impregnated with vinegar or camphor, at their noſes, or elſe ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bottles with the thieves' vinegar. Others carried pieces of tar in their hands, or pockets, or camphor bags tied round their necks. The corpſes of the moſt reſpectable citizens, even of thoſe who did not die of the epidemic, were carried to the grave, on the ſhafts of a chair, the horſe driven by a negro, unattended by a friend or relation, and without any ſort of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony. People ſhifted their courſe at the ſight of a hearſe coming towards them. Many never walked on the foot path, but went into the middle of the ſtreets, to avoid being infected in paſſing by houſes wherein people had died. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances and friends avoided each other in the ſtreets, and only ſignified their regard by a cold nod. The old cuſtom of ſhaking hands fell into ſuch general diſuſe, that many were affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at even the offer of the hand. A perſon with a crape, or any appearance of mourning, was
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:025255_0026_0FCCED6D389A4BA0"/>
ſhunned like a viper. And many valued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves highly on the ſkill and addreſs with which they got to windward of every perſon they met. Indeed it is not probable that London, at the laſt ſtage of the plague, exhibited ſtronger marks of terror, than were to be ſeen in Philadelphia, from the 24th or 25th of Auguſt till pretty late in September. When people ſummoned up reſolution to walk abroad, and take the air, the ſick cart conveying patients to the hoſpital, or the hearſe carrying the dead to the grave, which were travelling almoſt the whole day, ſoon damped their ſpirits, and plunged them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into deſpondency.</p>
            <p>While affairs were in this deplorable ſtate, and the people at the loweſt ebb of deſpair, we cannot be aſtoniſhed at the frightful ſcenes that were acted, which ſeemed to indicate a total diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the bonds of ſociety in the neareſt and deareſt connexions. Who, without horror, can reflect on a huſband deſerting his wife, united to him perhaps for twenty years, in the laſt agony—a wife unfeelingly abandoning her huſband on his death bed—parents forſaking their only children without remorſe—children
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:025255_0027_0FCCED6EDDBBF040"/>
ungratefully flying from their parents, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning them to chance, without an enquiry after their health or ſafety—maſters hurrying off their faithful ſervants to Buſhhill, even on ſuſpicion of the fever, and that at a time, when, like Tartarus, it was open to every viſitant, but never returned any—ſervants abandoning ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and humane maſters, who only wanted a little care to reſtore them to health and uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—who, I ſay, can even now think of theſe things without horror? Yet ſuch were daily exhibited in every quarter of our city.</p>
            <p>Theſe deſertions produced ſcenes of diſtreſs and miſery, of which few parallels are to be met with, and which nothing could palliate, but the extraordinary public panic, and the great law of ſelf preſervation, the dominion of which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends over the whole animated world. Many men of affluent fortunes, who have given em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment and ſuſtenance to hundreds every day in the year, have been abandoned to the care of a negro, after their wives, children, friends, clerks, and ſervants had fled away, and left them to their fate. In many caſes, no money could procure proper attendance. With the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:025255_0028_0FCCED7146A8BA28"/>
poor, the caſe was, as might be expected, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely worſe than with the rich. Many of theſe have periſhed, without a human being to hand them a drink of water, to adminiſter medicines, or to perform any charitable office for them. Various inſtances have occurred of dead bodies found lying in the ſtreets, of perſons who had no houſe or habitation, and could procure no ſhelter.</p>
            <p>A woman, whoſe huſband had juſt died of the fever, was ſeized with the pains of labour, and had nobody to aſſiſt her, as the women in the neighbourhood were afraid to go into the houſe. She lay for a conſiderable time in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of anguiſh that will not bear deſcription. At length, ſhe ſtruggled to reach the window, and cried out for aſſiſtance. Two men, paſſing by, went up ſtairs; but they came at too late a ſtage.—She was ſtriving with death—and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in a few minutes expired in their arms.</p>
            <p>A woman, whoſe huſband and two children lay dead in the room with her, was in the ſame ſituation, without a midwife, or any other perſon to aid her. Her cries at the window brought up one of the carters employed by the committee
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:025255_0029_0FCCED726ED2C548"/>
for the relief of the ſick. With his aſſiſtance, ſhe was delivered of a child, which died in a few minutes, as did the mother, who was utterly exhauſted by her labour, by the diſorder, and by the dreadful ſpectacle before her. And thus lay in one room, no leſs than five dead bodies, an entire family, carried off in an hour or two. Many inſtances have occurred, of reſpectable women, who, in their lying-in, have been oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to depend on ſervant women for aſſiſtance —and ſome have had none but their huſbands. Some of the midwives were dead—and others had left the city.</p>
            <p>A ſervant girl, belonging to a family in this city, in which the fever had prevailed, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of danger, and reſolved to remove to a relation's houſe, in the country. She was, however, taken ſick on the road, and returned to town, where ſhe could find no perſon to receive her. One of the guardians of the poor provided a cart, and took her to the alms houſe, into which ſhe was refuſed admittance. She was brought back, and the guardian offered five dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to provide her a ſingle night's lodging, but in vain. And in fine, after every effort made to
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:025255_0030_0FCCED73E3C4BD00"/>
provide her ſhelter, ſhe abſolutely expired in the cart.</p>
            <p>To relate all the frightful caſes of this nature that occurred, would fill a volume. Let theſe few ſuffice. But I muſt obſerve, that moſt of them happened in the firſt ſtage of the public panic. Afterwards, when the citizens recovered a little from their fright, they became rare.</p>
            <p>Great as was the calamity of Philadelphia, it was magnified in the moſt extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The hundred tongues of rumour were never more ſucceſsfully employed, than on this melancholy occaſion. The terror of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of all the neighbouring ſtates was excited by a ſucceſſion of letters from Philadelphia, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed by every mail, which told tales of woe, whereof hardly a ſingle circumſtance was true, but which were every where received with impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit faith. The diſtreſſes of the city, and the fata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the diſorder, were exaggerated as it were to ſee how far credulity could be carried. The plague of London was, according to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, hardly more fatal than our yellow fever. Our citizens died ſo faſt, that there was hardly
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:025255_0031_0FCCED7589946098"/>
enough of people to bury them. Ten, or fifteen, <hi>or more</hi> were ſaid to be caſt into one hole together, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <q>It is now a very mortal time in this city. The yellow fever hath killed <hi>ſome thouſands</hi> of the inhabitants. Eight thouſand mechanics, beſides other people, have left the town. Every maſter in the city, of our branch of buſineſs, is gone.</q>

               </note>. And the nature and danger of the diſorder, were as much miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, as the number of the dead. It was ſaid, in defiance of every day's experience, to be as inevitable by all expoſed to the contagion, as the ſtroke of fate.</p>
            <p>The effects produced by theſe letters, were ſuch as might be reaſonably expected. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation ſpread though the ſeveral ſtates like wild-fire. The firſt public act that took place on the ſubject, as far as I can learn, was at Cheſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, in Maryland. At this place, a meeting was held on the 10th of September, at which ſeveral reſolves were entered into, which, after ſpecify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:025255_0034_0FCCED7C755FC9B0"/>
that the diſorder had extended to Trenton, Princeton, Woodbridge, and Elizabeth-town, on the poſt road to New York, directed, that notice ſhould be ſent to the owners of the ſtages not to allow them to paſs through the town, while there ſhould be reaſon to expect danger therefrom; that a committee of health and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection ſhould be appointed, to provide for the relief of ſuch poor inhabitants as might take the diſorder, and likewiſe for ſuch ſtrangers as might be infected with it. They at the ſame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſeven perſons as this committee, with power to call a general meeting in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſpecified caſes. In conſequence of theſe reſolves, the Eaſtern ſhore line of ſtages was ſtopt in the courſe of a few days afterwards.</p>
            <p>The alarm in New York was firſt officially announced by a letter from the mayor to the practiſing phyſicians, dated Sept. 11, in which he requeſts them to report to him in writing the names of all ſuch perſons as had arrived, or ſhould arrive from Philadelphia, or any other place, by land or water, and were or ſhould be ſick; that ſuch as ſhould be deemed ſubjects of
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:025255_0035_0FCCED7E5AACA8B8"/>
infectious diſeaſes, might be removed out of the city. He notified them, that the corporation had taken meaſures to provide a proper place for an hoſpital, for ſuch perſons as might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily become ſubjects of the fever in New York. In this letter the mayor declared his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion clearly, that the intercourſe with Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, could not be lawfully interrupted by any power in the ſtate. The 12th appeared a procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from governor Clinton, which, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the
<q>act to prevent the bringing in, and ſpreading of infectious diſorders,</q>
prohibited, in the terms of that act, all veſſels from Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, to approach nearer to the city of New York, then Bedlow's iſland, about two miles diſtant, till duly diſcharged. The ſilence of this proclamation, reſpecting paſſengers by land, ſeemed to imply that the governor's opinion on the ſubject, was the ſame as that of the mayor.</p>
            <p>The ſame day, at a meeting of the citizens, the neceſſity of taking ſome precautions was unanimouſly agreed upon, and a committee of ſeven appointed to report a plan to a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be held next day. Their report, which was unanimouſly agreed to, the 13th, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:025255_0036_0FCCED7FE41FC998"/>
to hire two phyſicians, to aſſiſt the phyſician of the port in his examinations of veſſels; to check, as much as poſſible, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe by ſtages; to acquaint the proprietors of the ſouthern ſtages, that it was the earneſt wiſh of the inhabitants, that their carriages and boats ſhould not paſs during the prevalence of the diſorder in Philadelphia; and to requeſt the practitioners of phyſic to report, without fail, every caſe of fever, to which they might be called, occurring in any perſons that had or might arrive from Philadelphia, or have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with them. Not ſatisfied with theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, the corporation, on the 17th, came to a reſolution to ſtop all intercourſe between the two cities; and for this purpoſe guards were placed at the different landings, with orders to ſend back every perſon coming from Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia; and if any were diſcovered to have arrived after that date, they were to be directly ſent back. All perſons taking in lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, were called upon to give information of all people of the above deſcription, under pain of being proſecuted according to law. All good citizens were required to give information to the mayor, or any member of the committee, of any breach in the premiſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:025255_0037_0FCCED815D65DD18"/>All theſe ſtrict precautions being eluded by the fears and the vigilance of the fugitives from Philadelphia, on the 23d there was a meeting held, of delegates from the ſeveral wards of the city, in order to adopt more effectual meaſures. At this meeting, it was reſolved to eſtabliſh a night watch of not leſs than ten citizens in each ward, to guard againſt ſuch as might eſcape them by day. Not yet eaſed of their fears, they next day publiſhed an addreſs, in which they mentioned, that notwithſtanding their utmoſt vigilance, many perſons had been clandeſtinely landed upon the ſhores of New York iſland. They therefore again called upon their fellow citizens to be cautious how they received ſtrangers into their houſes; not to fail to report all ſuch to the mayor immediately upon their arrival; to remember the importance of the occaſion; and to conſider what reply they ſhould make to the juſt reſentment of their fellow citizens, whoſe lives they might expoſe by a criminal neglect, or infidelity. They likewiſe declared their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, that thoſe who kept the different ferries on the ſhores of New Jerſey and Staten iſland, would pay ſuch attention to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, as not to tranſport any perſon but to the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:025255_0038_0FCCED83DEF9EA98"/>
public landings, and that in the day time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſun and ſun. The 30th they publiſhed a lengthy addreſs, recapitulating the various pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions they had taken—the nature of the diſorder—and the numbers who had died out of Philadelphia, without communicating it to any one. They at the ſame time reſolved, that goods, bedding, and clothing, packed up in Philadelphia, ſhould, previous to their being brought into New York, be unpacked and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the open air in ſome well-ventilated place, for at leaſt 48 hours; that all linen or cotton clothes, or bedding, which had been uſed, ſhould be well waſhed in ſeveral waters; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that the whole, both ſuch as had been, and ſuch as had not been uſed, ſhould be hung up in a cloſe room, and well ſmoked with the fumes of brimſtone for one day, and after that again expoſed for at leaſt twenty four hours to the open air; and that the boxes, trunks, or cheſts, in which they had been packed, ſhould be cleaned and aired in the ſame manner; after which, being repacked, and ſuch evidence given of their purification, as the committee ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, permiſſion might be had to bring them into the city.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:025255_0039_0FCCED85A8A9FD08"/>The 11th of October, they likewiſe reſolved, that they would conſider and publiſh to the world, as enemies to the welfare of the city, and the lives of its inhabitants, all thoſe who ſhould be ſo ſelfiſh and hardy, as to attempt to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce any goods, wares, merchandize, bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, baggage, &amp;c. imported from, or packed up in Philadelphia, contrary to the rules preſcribed by that body, who were, they ſaid, deputed to expreſs the will of their fellow citizens. They recommended to the inhabitants to withſtand any temptation of profit, which might attend the purchaſe of goods in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, as no emolument to an individual, they added, could warrant the hazard to which ſuch conduct might expoſe the city. Beſides all theſe reſolves, they publiſhed daily ſtatements of the health of the city, to allay the fears of their f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I did not chooſe to interrupt this account of the proceedings of the committee of health, to mention, in order of time, that the clergy of New York had a meeting, on the 16th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, and unanimouſly agreed to ſet apart Friday, the 20th, as a day of humiliation, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:025255_0040_0FCCED86AA14BC50"/>
and prayer to Almighty God, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their city, from the fever, and for the comfort and ſupport of their brethren in Philadelphia, in the ſeaſon of their diſtreſs. The Dutch ſynod of New York had a meeting the firſt week in October, at which they agreed that thoſe churches under their care, which had not yet obſerved a day of faſt and prayer, ſhould devote the ſecond Wedneſday in November to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of Trenton and Lamberton aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated on the 13th of Sept. and on the 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th paſſed ſeveral reſolutions to guard themſelves againſt the contagion. They reſolved that a total ſtop ſhould be put to the landing of all perſons from Philadelphia, at any ferry or place from Lamberton to Howell's ferry, four miles above Trenton; that the intercourſe by water ſhould be prohibited between Lamberton, or the head of tide water, and Philadelphia; and that all boats from Philadelphia, ſhould be prevented from land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either goods or paſſengers any where between Bordentown and the head of tide water; that no perſon whatever ſhould be permi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="45" facs="unknown:025255_0041_0FCCED881E45A628"/>
continued; that all perſons who ſhould go from within the limits of the aſſociation, to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe places, ſhould be prevented from returning during the continuance of the fever; and finally, that their ſtanding committee ſhould enquire whether any perſons, not inhabitants, who had lately come from places infected, and were therefore likely to be infected themſelves, were within the limits of the aſſociation, and if ſo, that they ſhould be obliged inſtantly to leave the ſaid limits. The people of Jerſey obſerved the 1ſt of October, as a day of faſt and prayer, for the ſame purpoſe as thoſe of New York.</p>
            <p>The 12th of September, the governor of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryland publiſhed a proclamation, ſubjecting all veſſels from Philadelphia to the performance of a quarantine, not exceeding forty days, or as much leſs as might be judged ſafe by the health officers. It further ordered, that all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons going to Baltimore, to Havre de Grace, to the head of Elk, or, by any other route, making their way into that ſtate from Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, or any other place known to be infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the malignant fever, ſhould be ſubject to be examined, and prevented from proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:025255_0042_0FCCED89AC97AE10"/>
by perſons to be appointed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and who were to take the advice and opinion of the medical faculty in every caſe, in order that private affairs and purſuits might not be unneceſſarily impeded. This proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appointed two health officers for Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
            <p>The people of Baltimore met the 13th of September, and reſolved that none of their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens ſhould receive into their houſes any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons coming from Philadelphia, or other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected place, without producing a certificate from the health officer, or officer of patrol; and that any perſon who violated that reſolve, ſhould be held up to public view, as a proper object for the reſentment of the town. The 14th, a party of militia was diſpatched to take poſſeſſion of a paſs on the Philadelphia road, about two miles from Baltimore, to prevent the entrance of any paſſengers from Philadelphia without licenſe. Dr. Worthington, the health officer ſtationed at this paſs, was directed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe permiſſion to perſons afflicted with any malignant complaint, or who had not been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from Philadelphia, or other infected place,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:025255_0043_0FCCED8BC16DF780"/>
at leaſt ſeven days. The weſtern ſhore line of Philadelphia ſtages was ſtopped about the 18th or 19th.</p>
            <p>The 30th, the committee of health reſolved that no inhabitant of Baltimore, who ſhould viſit perſons from Philadelphia, while perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quarantine, ſhould be permitted to enter the town, until the time of quarantine was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, and until it was certainly known that the perſons he had viſited were free from the infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that thenceforward no goods capable of conveying infection, that had been landed or packed up in Philadelphia, or other infected place, ſhould be permitted to enter the town— nor ſhould any baggage of travellers be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, until it had been expoſed to the open air ſuch length of time as the health officer might direct.</p>
            <p>The 25th of September, the inhabitants of Havre de Grace, reſolved that no perſon ſhould be allowed to croſs the Suſquehannah river at that place, who did not bring a certificate of his not having lately come from Philadelphia, or any other infected place; and that the citizens of
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:025255_0044_0FCCED8D9FCD76D8"/>
Havre would embody themſelves to prevent any one from croſſing without ſuch a certificate.</p>
            <p>At Hagerſtown, on the 3d of October, it was reſolved, that no citizen ſhould receive into his houſe any perſon coming from Philadelphia, ſuppoſed to be infected with the malignant fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, until he or ſhe produced a certificate from a health officer; that ſhould any citizen contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene the above reſolution, he ſhould be cut off from all ſociety with his fellow citizens; that the clothing ſent to the troops then in that town, ſhould not be received there, nor ſuffered to come within ſeven miles thereof; that if any perſon from Philadelphia, or other infected place, ſhould arrive there, he ſhould be required inſtantly to depart, and in caſe of refuſal or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, be compelled to go without delay; that no merchant, or other perſon, ſhould be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bring into the town, or open therein, any goods brought from Philadelphia, or other infected place, until permitted by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee; and that the citizens of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:025255_0045_0FCCED8F01C42600"/>The governor of Virginia, on the 17th of September, iſſued a proclamation, ordering all veſſels from Philadelphia, the Grenades, and the iſland of Tobago, to perform a quarantine of twenty days, at the anchorage ground, off Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney iſland, near the mouth of Elizabeth river.</p>
            <p>The corporation of Alexandria ſtationed a look-out boat, to prevent all veſſels bound to that port, from approaching nearer than one mile, until after examination by the health of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer.</p>
            <p>The people of Wincheſter placed guards at every avenue of the town leading from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomac, to ſtop all ſuſpected perſons, packages, &amp;c. coming from Philadelphia till the health officers ſhould inſpect them, and either forbid or allow them to paſs.</p>
            <p>The legiſlature of Maſſachuſetts happened to be actually in ſeſſion, at the time the alarm ſpread; and they accordingly paſſed an expreſs act for guarding againſt the impending danger. This act directed that the ſelectmen in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent towns ſhould be authoriſed to ſtop and

examine any perſons, baggage, merchandize, or effects, coming, or ſuppoſed to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the towns reſpectively, from Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, or other place infected, or ſuppoſed to be infected; and ſhould it appear to them, or to any officers whom they ſhould appoint, that any danger of infection was to be apprehended from ſuch perſons, effects, baggage, or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ey were authoriſed to detain or remove the ſame to ſuch place as they might ſee proper, in order that they might be puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from infection; or to place any perſons ſo coming, in ſuch places, and under ſuch regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations as they might judge neceſſary for the public ſafety. In purſuance of this act, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor iſſued a proclamation to carry it into ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the 21ſt of September.</p>
            <p>The ſelectmen of Boſton, on the 24th, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed their regulations of quarantine, which ordered, that on the arrival of any veſſel from Philadelphia, ſhe ſhould be detained at, or near Rainsford's Iſland, to perform a quarantine not exceeding thirty days, during which time ſhe ſhould be cleanſed with vinegar, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſion of gunpowder between the decks and
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:025255_0047_0FCCED935A916828"/>
in the cabin, even though there were no ſick perſons on board; that in caſe there ſhould be ſick on board, they ſhould be removed to an hoſpital, where they ſhould be detained till they recovered, or were long enough to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they had not the infection; that every veſſel, performing quarantine, ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of its boat, and no boat ſuffered to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it, but by ſpecial permiſſion; that if any perſon ſhould eſcape, he ſhould be inſtantly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed, in order that he might be apprehended; that any perſons coming by land from Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, ſhould not be allowed to enter Boſton, until twenty one days after their arrival, and their effects, baggage, and merchandize ſhould be opened, waſhed, and fumigated with vinegar and repeated exploſions of gunpowder. In the concluſion, the ſelectmen called upon the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants to uſe their utmoſt vigilance and activity to bring to condign puniſhment any perſon who ſhould be ſo daring and loſt to every idea of humanity, as to come into the town from any place ſuppoſed to be infected, thereby endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lives of their fellow men.</p>
            <p>The governor of Rhode Iſland, the 21ſt of
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:025255_0048_0FCCED95EFE15EB8"/>
September, iſſued a proclamation, directing the town councils and other officers, to uſe their utmoſt vigilance to cauſe the law to prevent the ſpreading of contagious diſorders to be moſt ſtrictly executed, more eſpecially with reſpect to all veſſels which ſhould arrive in that ſtate from the Weſt Indies, Philadelphia, and New-York; the extenſion to the latter place was ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the danger apprehended from the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between it and Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>The 28th of September, the governor of North Carolina publiſhed his proclamation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the commiſſioners of navigation in the different ports, and the commiſſioners of the different towns in the ſaid ſtate, to appoint cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain places, where all veſſels from the port of Philadelphia, or any other place where the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant fever might prevail, ſhould perform quarantine for ſuch number of days as they might think proper.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of Charleſton do not ſeem to have been far behind their neighbours in their apprehenſions or their cautions. The 8th of Oct. they had a meeting, at which they reſolved,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:025255_0049_0FCCED980F94A5C0"/>
that no veſſel from the river Delaware, either directly or after having touched at any other port of the united ſtates, ſhould be permitted to paſs Charleſton bar, till the citizens have again aſſembled, and declared themſelves ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the diſorder has ceaſed in Philadelphia. If any veſſel, contrary thereto, ſhould croſs the bar, his excellency ſhould be requeſted to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel it to quit the port, and return to ſea. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this meeting, veſſels from Philadelphia had been obliged to perform quarantine; but by what regulation, I cannot aſcertain.</p>
            <p>The governor of Georgia, on the 4th of October, publiſhed a proclamation, ordering all veſſels from Philadelphia, which ſhould arrive in Savannah river, to remain in Tybee creek, or in other parts at like diſtance from the town, until the health officer of the port ſhould, on examination, certify, that no malignant or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious diſeaſe was on board. All perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travening this proclamation, were to be proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and ſubjected to the pains and penalties by law pointed out.</p>
            <p>The people of Auguſta, in that ſtate, were
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:025255_0050_0FCCED9960199EF0"/>
as active and vigilant as their northern neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to guard againſt the threatening dangers.</p>
            <p>While our citizens were thus preſcribed in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral cities and towns—hunted up like felons in ſome—and debarred admittance and turned back in others, whether ſound or infected—it is with extreme ſatisfaction I have to record a conduct totally different, which cannot fail to make an indelible impreſſion on the minds of the people of Philadelphia, and call forth the moſt lively emotions of gratitude.</p>
            <p>A reſpectable number of the inhabitants of Springfield, in New Jerſey, met the firſt day of October, and after a full conſideration of the diſtreſſes of our citizens, paſſed a reſolve, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their town as an aſylum to the people flying from Philadelphia, and directing their commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee to provide a ſuitable place as an hoſpital for ſuch of them as might be ſeized with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing malignant fever.</p>
            <p>I have been informed, by a perſon of credit, that the inhabitants of Elizabeth town have purſued the ſame liberal pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, as thoſe of Springfield; but have not been able to procure
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:025255_0051_0FCCED9AE1B65F00"/>
a copy of their reſolves or proceedings on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>An aſylum has likewiſe been offered to Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphians, by ſeveral of the inhabitants of Elk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in Maryland; and the offer was couched in terms of the utmoſt ſympathy for our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
            <p>The inſtances of this kind, through this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive country, have been very few; but they are therefore only the more precious, and ought to be held up to public approbation. May they operate on people, at a future day, in ſimilar caſes of dreadful calamity—and teach them to temper their caution with as much humanity and tenderneſs to the diſtreſſed fugitives, as prudence will allow—and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve in one indiſcriminate proſcription the healthy and infected.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the ſituation of affairs in Philadelphia, became daily more and more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The three guardians of the poor for the city, who, as I have ſaid, continued to act, were quite oppreſſed with the labours of their office, which increaſed to ſuch a degree, that they
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:025255_0052_0FCCED9E070178E8"/>
were utterly unable to execute them. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of diſeaſed perſons became very great. Owing to the general terror, nurſes, carters, and attendants could hardly be procured. Thus circumſtanced, the mayor of the city, on the 10th of September, publiſhed an addreſs to the citizens, announcing that the guardians of the poor, who remained, were in diſtreſs for want of aſſiſtance, and inviting ſuch benevolent citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens as felt for the general diſtreſs, to lend their aid. In conſequence of this advertiſement, a meeting of the citizens was held at the city hall, on the 12th of September, at which very few attended, from the univeral conſternation that prevailed. The ſtate of the poor was fully conſidered; and ten citizens, Iſrael Iſrael, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Wetherill, Thomas Wiſtar, Andrew Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, Caleb Lownes, Henry Deforeſt, Thomas Peters, Joſeph Inſkeep, Stephen Gerard, and John Maſon, offered themſelves to aſſiſt the guardians of the poor. At this meeting, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee was appointed to confer with the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians who had the care of Buſh-hill. This committee reported next evening, that the hoſpital was in very bad order, and in want of almoſt every thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:025255_0053_0FCCED9F5DBFD840"/>The 14th, another meeting was held, when the urgent neceſſities of the ſick being fully conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it was reſolved to borrow 1500 dollars of the bank of North America, for the purpoſe of procuring ſuitable accommodations for the uſe of perſons afflicted with the prevailing malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fever. At this meeting, a committee was appointed to tranſact the whole of the buſineſs relative to the relief of the ſick, and the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of phyſicians, nurſes, attendants, &amp;c. This is the committee, which, by virtue of that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, has from that day to the preſent time, watched over the ſick, the poor, they wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and the orphan. It is worthy of remark, and may encourage others in times of public ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, that this committee conſiſted originally of only twenty-ſix perſons, men taken from the middle walks of life, and of the moderate pitch of abilities; of theſe, four, Andrew Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, Jonathan Dickinſon Sargeant, Daniel Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fley, and Joſeph Inſkeep, died, the two firſt at an early period of their labours—and four ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attended to the appointment. "The heat and burden of the day" have therefore been borne by eighteen perſons, whoſe exertions have been ſo highly favoured by providence, that
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:025255_0054_0FCCEDA26E442978"/>
they have been the inſtruments of averting the progreſs of deſtruction, eminently relieving the diſtreſſed, and reſtoring confidence to the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified inhabitants of Philadelphia. It is honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this committee, that from the time of their organization to the preſent, they have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved together in more harmony than is generally to be met with in public bodies of equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>Never, perhaps, was there a city in the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Philadelphia at this period. The preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the united ſtates, according to his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual cuſtom, had removed to Mount Vernon, with his houſehold. Moſt, if not all of the other officers of the federal government were abſent. The governor, who had been ſick, had gone, by directions of his phyſician, to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſeat near the talls of Schuylkill—and nearly the whole of the officers of the ſtate had likewiſe retired.—The magiſtrates of the city, except the mayor, were away, as were moſt of thoſe of the liberties. Of the ſituation of the guardians of the poor I have already made mention. In fact, government of every kind was almoſt wholly vacated, and by univerſal conſent veſted in the committee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:025255_0055_0FCCEDA41A352AE0"/>On the 15th, the committee reſolved, that three members of their board ſhould attend daily at the city hall, to receive applications for relief, to provide for the burial of the dead, and the conveyance to Buſhhill of all perſons la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under the fever, who might be willing to go there. This order was ſoon reſcinded, it being found neceſſary for all the members to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at the hall.</p>
            <p>This day, a circumſtance occurred, to which the moſt glowing pencil could hardly do juſtice. Stephen Girard, a wealthy merchant, a native of France, touched with the wretched ſituation of the ſufferers at Buſh hill, voluntarily and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly offered to ſuperintend that hoſpital. The ſurpriſe and ſatisfaction, excited by this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary effort of humanity, can be better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived than expreſſed. Peter Helm, a native of Pennſylvania, actuated by the like benevolent motives, offered his ſervices in the ſame depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Their offers were accepted, and the ſame afternoon they entered on the execution of their dangerous and praiſeworthy office.</p>
            <p>To form a juſt eſtimate of the value of the offer of theſe men, it is neceſſary to take into
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:025255_0056_0FCCEDA597C93008"/>
full conſideration the general conſternation, which at that period pervaded every quarter of the city, and which made attendance on the ſick be regarded as little leſs than a certain ſacrifice. Uninfluenced by any reflexions of this kind, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any poſſible inducement but the pureſt motives of humanity, they came forward, and offered themſelves as the forlorn hope of the committee. I truſt that the gratitude of their fellow citizens will remain as long as the memory of their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent conduct, which I hope will not die with the preſent generation. While I am on this ſubject, let me add, that from the time of undertaking this office to the preſent, they have attended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interruptedly, for ſix, ſeven or eight hours a day, renouncing almoſt every care of private affairs. They have had a moſt irkſome tour of duty to perform—to encourage and comfort the ſick—to hand them neceſſaries and medicines—to wipe the ſweat off their brows—and to perform many diſguſting offices of kindneſs for them, which nothing could render tolerable, but the exalted motives that impelled them to this heroic conduct.</p>
            <p>On the 16th, the managers of Buſhhill, after
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:025255_0057_0FCCEDA6D924D808"/>
perſonal inſpection of the ſtate of affairs there, made report of its ſituation, which was truly deplorable. It exhibited as wretched a picture of human miſery as ever exiſted. A profligate, abandoned ſet of nurſes and attendants (hardly any of good character could at that time be procured,) rioted on the proviſions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, prepared for the ſick, who (unleſs at the hours when the doctors attended) were left al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entirely deſtitute of every aſſiſtance. The dying and dead were indiſcriminately mingled together. The ordure and other evacuations of the ſick, were allowed to remain in the moſt offenſive ſtate imaginable. Not the ſmalleſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of order or regularity exiſted. It was, in fact, a great human ſlaughter houſe, where numerous victims were immolated at the altar of riot and intemperance. No wonder, then, that a general dread of the place prevailed through the city, and that a removal to it was conſidered as the ſeal of death. In conſequence, there were various inſtances of ſick perſons locking their rooms, and reſiſting every attempt to carry them away. At length, the poor were ſo much afraid of being ſent to Buſhhill, that they would not acknowledge their illneſs, until
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:025255_0058_0FCCEDA85E9DFB70"/>
it was no longer poſſible to conceal it. For it is to be obſerved, that the fear of the contagion was ſo prevalent, that as ſoon as any one was taken ſick, an alarm was ſpread among the neighbours, and every effort was uſed to have the ſick perſon hurried off to Buſhhill, to avoid ſpreading the diſorder. The caſes of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons forced in this way to that hoſpital, though labouring under only common colds, and common fall fevers, are numerous and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting. There were not wanting inſtances of perſons, only ſlightly ill, being ſent to Buſhhill, by their panic-ſtruck neighbours, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the firſt opportunity of running back to Philadelphia. But the caſe was ſoon altered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the direction of the two managers, Girard and Helm. They introduced ſuch order and regularity, and had the patients treated with ſo much care and tenderneſs, that they retrieved the character of the hoſpital; and in the courſe of a week or two, numbers of ſick people, who had not at home proper perſons to nurſe them, applied to be ſent to Buſhhill. Indeed, in the end, ſo many people, who were afflicted with other diſorders, procured admittance there, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come neceſſary to paſs a reſolve, that before an
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:025255_0059_0FCCEDA9DB99EB00"/>
order of admiſſion ſhould be granted, a certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate muſt be produced from a phyſician, that the patient laboured under the malignant fever.</p>
            <p>The committee ſat daily at the city hall, and engaged a number of carts to convey the dead to a place of interment, and the ſick to the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital. From their organization to the preſent time, they have moſt unremittingly attended to the diſcharge of the truſt repoſed in them. Neither the regular increaſe of deaths till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the middle of October, nor the afflicting loſs of four very active members, in quick ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, appalled them. That the mortality would have been incomparably greater, but for their active interpoſition, is beyond doubt; as moſt of thoſe who went to Buſhhill, and died there, would have otherwiſe died in the city, and ſpread the contagion: and the dead bodies would have remained putrifying in deſerted houſes in every part of the city, and operated as dreadfully as the plague itſelf. In fact, at the time they entered on the execution of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous office they undertook, there were found ſeveral bodies that had lain in this ſtate for two, three, and four days.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:025255_0060_0FCCEDAB61BFDCB0"/>In the progreſs of the diſorder, the committee found the calls on their humanity increaſe. The numerous deaths of heads of families l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ft a very large body of children in a moſt abandon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn ſtate. The bettering houſe, in which ſuch helpleſs objects have been uſually placed hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was barred againſt them, by the order which I have already mentioned. Many of theſe little innocents were actually ſuffering for want of even common neceſſaries. The deaths of their parents and protectors, which ſhould have been the ſtrongeſt recommendation to public charity, was the very reaſon of their diſtreſs, and of their being ſhunned as a peſtilence. The children of a family once in eaſy circumſtances, were found in a blackſmith's ſhop, ſqualid, dirty, and half ſtarved, having been for a conſiderable time without even bread to eat. Various inſtances of a ſimilar nature occurred. This evil early caught the attention of the committee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and on the 19th of September, they hired a houſe in Fifth-ſtreet, in which they placed thirteen children. The number increaſing, on the 3d of October, they procured the Loganian library, which was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly given up by John Swanwick, Eſq. for the purpoſe of an orphan houſe. A further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:025255_0061_0FCCEDACDFE55FF0"/>
of their little charge, rendered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ceſſary to build ſome additions to the library, which are now finiſhed, and are nearly half as large as that building. At preſent, there are in the houſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the care of the orphan committee, above eighty children, and about forty are out with wet nurſes. From the origin of the inſtitution, one hundred and ſixty children have fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their care, of whom ſeven are dead, all of whom, except one, were ſucking children; and about thirty have been delivered to their relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or friends. There are inſtances of five and ſix children of a ſingle family in the houſe.</p>
            <p>Another duty ſoon attracted the attention of the committee. The flight of ſo many of our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, the conſequent ſtagnation of buſineſs, and the almoſt total ceſſation of the labours of the guardians of the poor, brought on among the lower claſſes of the people, a great degree of diſtreſs, which loudly demanded the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the humane. In conſequence, on the 20th of September, a ſub-committee of diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was appointed, to furniſh ſuch aſſiſtance to deſerving objects as their reſpective caſes might
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:025255_0062_0FCCEDAE6133C950"/>
require, and the funds allow<note n="*" place="bottom">They had, in addition to the firſt loan from the bank of North America, borrowed 5000 dollars from the ſame inſtitution, making in the whole 6500.</note>. This was at firſt adminiſtered ſparingly, owing to the confined ſtate of their finances. But the very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary liberality of our fugitive fellow citizens, of the citizens of New York, and of thoſe of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious towns and townſhips, encouraged the committee to extend their views. And frequent impoſitions being attempted on them, they, on the 14th of October, called to their aſſiſtance a number of reſpectable characters in the different parts of the city and liberties, to ſeek out and give recommendations to deſerving objects in diſtreſs. Theſe gentlemen have undertaken this troubleſome office, which they execute with ſo much circumſpection, as to defeat the arts of impoſtors. At preſent, there are about twelve hundred people relieved weekly, moſt of whom have conſiderable families, ſome of four, ſix, and eight perſons. The number, therefore, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the committee for aſſiſtance, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably above four thouſand. The gradual revival
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:025255_0063_0FCCEDB04AD5DD60"/>
of buſineſs promiſes to reſcue ſome of theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſpeedily from the humiliation of a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on public charity; and the organization of the guardians of the poor will make proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the remainder.</p>
            <p>From this time, the proceedings of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee went on in a regular, uniform tenor, every day like the paſt, without any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable occurring, worth recording. For above five weeks of the time they have been employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the moſt dreary proſpects appeared before them. The number of perſons to be removed to Buſhhill daily, was for a long time from twenty to thirty—and the number to be buried by their carters, was often equal. Theſe two cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, the removals to the hoſpital, and the perſons buried from the city-hall, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as the barometer, by which to judge of the ſtate of the diſeaſe; and in general they were a juſt one.</p>
            <p>The week, beginning Sunday the 27th of October, proved for the moſt part cold and raw. Eaſterly winds generally prevailed. Thurſday and Friday, there was a conſiderable fall of rain.
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:025255_0064_0FCCEDB1739638F8"/>
A viſible alteration has already taken place in the ſtate of affairs in the city. Our abſent friends return in crowds. Every hour in the day, old faces appear—and in many inſtances, thoſe of perſons, whom public fame has buried for weeks paſt. The ſtores, ſo long cloſed, are opening faſt. Some of the country merchants, bolder than others, are daily venturing in to their old place of ſupply. Market-ſtreet is nearly as full of wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons as uſual. The cuſtom houſe, for weeks near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerted by our mercantile people, is throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by citizens entering their veſſels and goods —the ſtreets, too long the abode of gloom and deſpair, have aſſumed the buſtle ſuitable to the ſeaſon. The arrival in the city of our beloved preſident gives us a flattering proſpect of the next ſeſſion of congreſs being held here. And, in fine, as every thing, in the early ſtage of the diſorder, ſeemed calculated to add to the general conſternation; ſo now, on the contrary, every circumſtance has a tendency to revive the courage and hopes of our citizens. But we have to lament, that the ſame ſpirit of exaggeration and lying, that prevailed at a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer period, and was the grand cauſe of the harſh meaſures adopted by our ſiſter ſtates, has
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:025255_0065_0FCCEDB2DB50A148"/>
not ceaſed to operate; for at the preſent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the danger is entirely done away, the credulous of our own citizens ſtill abſent, and of the country people, are ſtill alarmed by frightful rumours, of the diſorder raging with as much violence as ever; of numbers carried off, a few hours after their return; and of new caſes daily occurring. To what deſign to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute theſe ſhameful tales, I know not. Were I to regard them in a ſpirit of reſentment, I ſhould be inclined to charge them to ſome ſecret, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted views of their authors, intent, if poſſible, to effect the entire deſtruction of our city. But I will not allow myſelf to conſider them in this point of light—and will even ſuppoſe they ariſe from a proneneſs to terrific narration, natural to ſome men. But they ſhould conſider, that we are in the ſituation of the frogs in the fable— while theſe tales, which make the hair of the country people ſtand an end, are ſport to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricators, they are death to us. And I here aſſert, and defy contradiction, that of the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our fugitive citizens, who have already returned, amounting to ſome thouſands, not above two are dead—and theſe owe their fate to the moſt ſhameful neglect of airing and
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:025255_0066_0FCCEDB5EBA80E50"/>
cleanſing their houſes, notwithſtanding the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cautions publiſhed by the committee. If peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will venture into houſes in which infected air has been pent up for weeks together without any purification, we cannot be ſurprized at the conſequences, however fatal they may be. But let not the cataſtrophe of a few incautious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons operate to bring diſcredit on a city contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above fifty thouſand people.</p>
            <p>At the time of writing theſe lines, the 10th of November, the committee look forward with pleaſure to the moment of ſurrendering up their truſt to a town meeting of their fellow citizens, the conſtituents by whom they were called into the extraordinary office they have filled. To them they will give an account of their ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſhip in a time of diſtreſs, the like of which heaven avert from the people of America for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. They hope a candid conſtruction will be put upon their conduct—and that it will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that they have acted in every caſe that has come under their cognizance, according to the beſt of their judgment.</p>
            <p>The ſympathy for our calamities diſplayed in
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:025255_0067_0FCCEDB835C050A0"/>
various places, reflects the higheſt honour on their inhabitants, and demands our warmeſt gratitude. The inhabitants of Glouceſter county in New Jerſey, have the honour of being firſt in this laudable race. So early as the 30th of September, they had a conſiderable ſum collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with which they purchaſed a quantity of proviſions for the uſe of the hoſpital at Buſh-hill. They have from that time regularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued copious ſupplies twice a week. From a few citizens of Philadelphia, near Germantown, there have been received two thouſand dollars; from others near Darby, fourteen hundred; from New York, five thouſand; from a perſon unknown, five hundred; from Bucks' county ſixteen hundred; from Delaware county twelve hundred; from Franklin county nearly five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; from Boſton ſundry articles, eſtimated at twenty-five hundred; and from ſundry other perſons and places, contributions equally liberal and honourable.</p>
            <p>The diſorder raged with increaſed violence, as the ſeaſon advanced towards the mild fall months. In the month of September, the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality was much greater than in Auguſt; and ſtill greater in October, to the 25th, than in Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember.
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:025255_0068_0FCCEDBA4E3D37C8"/>
What is very particularly worthy of attention, is, that though all the hopes of the citizens reſted on cold and rain, eſpecially the latter, yet the diſorder was extinguiſhed with hardly any rain, and a very moderate degree of cold. The 26th may be ſet down as the day when the virulence of the fever expired. The deaths afterwards were few, and moſtly of thoſe long ſick. Hardly any perſons have ſince ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it. That day was as warm as many of the moſt fatal ones in the early part of the month. To account for this is perhaps above our power. In fact, the whole of the diſorder, from its firſt appearance to its final cloſe, has ſet human wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and calculation at defiance.</p>
            <p>Rarely has it happened, that ſo large a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the gentlemen of the faculty have ſunk beneath the labours of their very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous profeſſion, as on this occaſion. In little more than a month, excluſive of medical ſtudents, no leſs than ten phyſicians have been ſwept off, doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Hutchinſon, Morris, Linn, Pennington, Dodds, Johnſon, Glentworth, Phile, Graham, and Green. Hardly one of the practiſing doctors that remained in the city, eſcaped ſickneſs— ſome were three, four, and five times confined.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:025255_0069_0FCCEDBB263D9CA0"/>To the clergy it has likewiſe proved very fatal. Expoſed, in the exerciſe of the laſt duties to the dying, to equal danger with the phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, it is not ſurpriſing that ſo many of them have fallen. Their names are, the rev. Alexander Murray, of the proteſtant epiſcopal church—the rev. F. A. Fleming and the rev. Laurence Graeſsl of the Roman catholic—the rev. John Winkhauſe, of the German reformed—the rev. James Sproat, of the preſbyterian—the rev. William Dougherty, of the methodiſt church— and three preachers of the Friends ſociety, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel Offley, Huſon Langſtroth, and Charles Williams. Six clergymen have been in the greateſt danger from this diſorder, the rev. R. Blackwell, rev. Joſeph Pilmore, rev. William Rogers, rev. Chriſtopher V. Keating, rev. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric Schmidt, and the rev. Joſeph Turner; but they have all recovered.</p>
            <p>Among the women, the mortality has not by any means been ſo great, as among the men<note n="*" place="bottom">In many congregations, the deaths of men have been twice as numerous as thoſe of women.</note>,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:025255_0070_0FCCEDBCCC91C9E8"/>
nor among the old and infirm as among the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-aged and robuſt.</p>
            <p>To tipplers and drunkards, and to men who lived high, and were of a corpulent habit of body, this diſorder was very fatal. Of theſe, many were ſeized, and the recoveries were very rare.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>filles de joie,</hi> it has been equally fatal. The wretched debilitated ſtate of their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, rendered them an eaſy prey to this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſorder, which very ſoon terminated their miſerable career.</p>
            <p>It has been dreadfully deſtructive among the poor. It is very probable, that at leaſt ſeven eighths of the number of the dead, were of that claſs. The inhabitants of dirty houſes have ſeverely expiated their neglect of cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and decency, by the numbers of them that have fallen ſacrifices. Whole families in ſuch houſes have ſunk into one ſilent, undiſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grave.</p>
            <p>The mortality in confined ſtreets, ſmall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:025255_0071_0FCCEDBEE3F7FE18"/>
and cloſe houſes, debarred of a free circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of air, has exceeded, in a great proportion, that in the large ſtreets and well-aired houſes. In ſome of the allies, a third or fourth of the whole of the inhabitants are no more. In 30 houſes, the whole number in Pewter Platter alley, 32 peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple died: and in Market-ſtreet, in 170 houſes, only 39. The ſtreets in the ſuburbs that had the benefit of the country air, eſpecially towards the weſt part of the city, have ſuffered little. Of the wide, airy ſtreets, none loſt ſo many people as Arch, near Water-ſtreet, which may be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for by its proximity to the original ſeat of the diſorder. It is to be particularly remarked, that in general, the more remote the ſtreets were from Water ſtreet, the leſs they experienced of the calamity.</p>
            <p>From the effects of this diſorder, the French ſettled in Philadelphia, have been in a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable degree exempt. To what this may be owing, is a ſubject deſerving particular inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By ſome it has been aſcribed to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing the danger. But, though this may have had ſome effect, it will not certainly account for it altogether; as it is well known that
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:025255_0072_0FCCEDC12346E628"/>
many of the moſt courageous perſons in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, have been among its victims. By many of the French, the prevalence and mortality of the diſorder have been attributed to the vaſt quantities of crude and unwholeſome fruits brought to our markets, and conſumed by all claſſes of people.</p>
            <p>The effect of fear in prediſpoſing the body for this and other diſorders, and increaſing their malignance, when taken, is well known. The following exception to the general rule, for the truth of which I pledge myſelf, is curious and intereſting. A young woman, whoſe fears were ſo very prevalent, as not only to render her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy from the commencement of the diſorder, but even to interfere with the happineſs of the family with whom ſhe lived, had to attend on ſeven perſons, all of whom were in a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſtate, and one of whom died. Her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance was aſſiduous and unremitted for nearly three weeks. Yet ſhe has never been in the ſlighteſt degree affected.</p>
            <p>At an early ſtage of the diſorder, the elders of the African church met, and offered their
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:025255_0073_0FCCEDC5CAFC8BB8"/>
ſervices to the mayor, to procure nurſes for the ſick, and to aſſiſt in burying the dead. Their offers were accepted; and Abſalom Jones and Richard Allen undertook the former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, that of furniſhing nurſes, and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Gray, the latter—the interment of the dead. The great demand for nurſes afforded an opportunity for impoſition, which was eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeized by ſome of the vileſt of the blacks. They extorted two, three, four, and even five dollars a night for attendance, which would have been well paid by a ſingle dollar. Some of them were even detected in plundering the houſes of the ſick. But it is wrong to caſt a cenſure on the whole for this ſort of conduct, as many people have done. The ſervices of Jones, Allen, and Gray, and others of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ur, have been very great, and demand public grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
            <p>When the yellow fever prevailed in South Carolina, the negroes, according to that accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate obſerver, Dr. Lining, were wholly free from it.
<q>There is ſomething very ſingular in the conſtitution of the negroes,</q>
ſays he,
<q>which renders them not liable to this fever;
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:025255_0074_0FCCEDC837FFA9B0"/>
for though many of them were as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as the nurſes to this infection; yet I never knew one inſtance of this fever among them, though they are equally ſubject with the white people to the bilious fever.</q>

They did not eſcape the diſorder; however, the number of them that were ſeized with it, was not great; and, as I am informed by an eminent doctor,
<q>it yielded to the power of medicine in them more eaſily than in the whites.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe who reflect on the many revolting ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of cruelty and deſertion of friends and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which occurred in Philadelphia, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may regret, cannot be ſurpriſed, that in the country and in various towns and cities, inhumanity ſhould be experienced by Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phians from ſtrangers. The univerſal conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation extinguiſhed in people's breaſts the moſt honourable feelings of human nature; and in this caſe, as in various others, the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:025255_0075_0FCCEDC96E04CEB8"/>
operated as injuriouſly as the reality. Many travellers from this city, exhauſted with fatigue and with hunger, have been refuſed all ſhelter and all ſuſtenance, and have fallen victims to the fears, not to the want of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, of thoſe to whom they applied for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Inſtances of this kind have occurred on almoſt every road leading from Philadelphia. People under ſuſpicion of having this diſorder, have been forced by their fellow travellers to quit the ſtages, and periſhed in the woods without a poſſibility of procuring any aſſiſtance. At Milford, in Delaware ſtate, a waggon-load of goods from Philadelphia, was actually burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and a woman, who came with it, was tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and feathered<note n="*" place="bottom">I am informed that a reſpectable merchant in this city can vouch for the truth of this circumſtance.</note>.</p>
            <p>There is one fact reſpecting this diſorder, which renders it probable, that the exerciſe of the duties of humanity towards the fugitive Philadelphans, would not have been attended with the danger univerſally imagined. In defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:025255_0076_0FCCEDCAD423B360"/>
of all the reſolutions entered into by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of various towns, many of our infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed citizens evaded their vigilance, and took re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge among them, and in only one or two ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is it known that they communicated the diſorder—and even in theſe not mortally. Three perſons from Philadelphia died of this diſorder, in one houſe at Woodbury, in New Jerſey; they had been attended during their illneſs by the family, none of whom caught the infection. Six or ſeven died at Darby, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at Germantown, and eight at Haddonfield, without communicating it to any of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. A man from Philadelphia, of the name of Cornell, died in New York, about two days after his arrival. The place of his death was a boarding houſe, in which were a number of boarders, one of whom ſlept in the ſame bed with him. Two of the family only were ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected—but not in ſuch a degree as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire medical aid. Three other infected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from our city, who, when diſcovered, were removed to Governor's iſland, died there, and no one took the diſorder from them. A man died at one of the principal taverns in Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timore, of the ſame diſorder. Many people had
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:025255_0077_0FCCEDCD2F32F260"/>
viſited and attended him during the whole of his illneſs, without injury. No perſon was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected but his doctor, whoſe indiſpoſition was not of long continuance. A great number of ſimilar inſtances have occurred at Burlington, Bordenton, Lamberton, Princeton, Brunſwic, Woodbridge, Newark, Lancaſter, and various other places, and in no caſe, except thoſe at Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timore and New York, has the infection ſpread.</p>
            <p>The terror that prevailed in Philadelphia, and which was ſpread through the continent, aroſe from the fatality of the diſorder at firſt, very few of thoſe who took it then having eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. This, with all deference to the medical gentlemen, aroſe probably from their being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with it. That this was the caſe, is candily acknowledged by ſeveral of the moſt eminent among them. The fact is, that the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was at no time greater, than about the end of Auguſt, at which period, the deaths did not very far exceed the uſual number in that month. When the mortality raged moſt dreadfully, from the middle of September to the middle of October, the public were much leſs alarmed, owing to the occurrence of ſeveral recoveries,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:025255_0078_0FCCD92B9B853638"/>
and their becoming callous by the force of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. During this time it was, that all the ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſmelling bottles, handkerchiefs ſteeped in vinegar, camphor bags, &amp;c. diſappeared.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of the police and of ſociety in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, appears to no ſmall advantage, when we conſider one circumſtance. Notwithſtanding the abſence of the magiſtrates, and the immenſe value of property left unprotected through the fears of the owners, and the deaths of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons left to take care of it, we have as yet heard of only one or two burglaries committed.— Another was attempted, but the plunderers were diſcovered and taken. A hardened villain from a neighbouring ſtate, formed a plot with ſome negroes to plunder houſes. He was a maſter rogue, had digeſted a complete ſyſtem, and formed a large partnerſhip for the more ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful execution of his ſchemes. However he was ſoon ſeized, and the company diſſolved.</p>
            <p>The jail of Philadelphia is under ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent regulation, that the diſorder made its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance there only in two or three inſtances, although ſuch abodes of miſery are the places
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:025255_0079_0FCCEDD4519A5130"/>
where contagious diſorders are moſt commonly generated. When the yellow fever raged moſt violently in the city, there were in the jail one hundred and ſix French ſoldiers and ſailors, confined by order of the French conſul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides eighty convicts, vagrants, and perſons for trial; all of whom, except two or three, remained perfectly free from the complaint. Several circumſtances have conſpired to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this ſalutary effect. The people confined are frequently cleanſed and purified by the uſe of the cold bath—they are kept conſtantly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed—vegetables form a conſiderable part of their diet—in the yard, vegetation flouriſhes —and many of them being employed in ſtone cutting, the water, conſtantly running, keeps the atmoſphere in a moiſt ſtate, while the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Philadelphia have been uninterruptedly parched up by unceaſing heat. Elijah Weed, the late jailor, caught the diſorder in the city, in the performance of the paternal duties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his daughter, and died in the jail, without communicating it to any of the people confined. I hope I ſhall be pardoned for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a tribute to the memory of this valuable citizen, under whoſe government of the jail,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:025255_0080_0FCCEDD5F3F61BD8"/>
and with whoſe hearty co-operation, moſt of the regulations in that inſtitution have been effected, which, with the ſucceſsful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made in England, prove that jails may be eaſily converted from ſinks of human depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and wretchedneſs, into places of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that, inſtead of rendering the idle vagrant, confined merely on ſuſpicion, or for want of friends to protect him, obdurate, wicked, and ripe for rapine and ſpoil, the profligate and abandoned may leave them in a ſituation to become uſeful members of ſociety. For the honour of human nature, it ought to be recorded, that ſome of the convicts in the jail, a part of the term of whoſe confinement had been remitted as a reward for their peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, orderly behaviour, voluntarily offered themſelves as nurſes to attend the ſick at Buſh-hill, and have in that capacity conducted themſelves with ſo much fidelity and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that they have had the repeated thanks of the managers. Among them are ſome who were formerly regarded, and with juſtice, as har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened abandoned villains, which the old ſyſtem was calculated to make every tenant of a jail, who remained there a few weeks. According
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:025255_0081_0FCCEDD7AC129F90"/>
to the ſame ſummary ſyſtem, theſe men's lives would have been long ſince offered up as an atonement to ſociety for the injury they had done it. That is, in plain Engliſh, becauſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety had ſuffered one injury by rapine, it was neceſſary it ſhould ſuffer another by law. But by the improved plan, they and great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of others are reſtored to ſociety and uſefulneſs once more. So much better, although not quite ſo eaſy, is it to reform men, than to butcher them under colour of law and juſtice.</p>
            <p>In the ſummer of 1791, the yellow fever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in New York, in a part of Water-ſtreet; and in proportion to the ſphere of its action was as fatal there as it has been here. It began in Auguſt, and continued till the middle of September, when it totally diſappeared, and has never ſince viſited that place. This ſhould eaſe the fears of many among us, who, always viewing the black ſide of every thing, terrify people with their prognoſtications, that we ſhall have it again next ſpring or ſummer. All the ſymptoms were full as dangerous and alarming in New York, as in Philadelphia. Many perſons died in three days;
<q>ſtupor,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:025255_0082_0FCCEDD920D63448"/>
delirium, yellowneſs, the black vomit, and death, rapidly ſucceeding each other.</q>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Letter from a phyſician in New York, to his friend in New Jerſey, Federal Gazette, Sept. 21, 1793.</note> It ſpread no farther at that time, than the one ſtreet, although no precautions, as far as I can learn, were taken to prevent its extenſion. The ſame ſpecies of diſorder raged in this city in 1762, with great violence. It diſappeared in the month of November, and has not from that time until this year viſited Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</p>
            <p>The ſummer and fall of this year have been unhealthy in many parts of the union, as well as in Philadelphia. At Lynn, in Maſſachuſetts, I have been informed, but have no means of aſcertaining the truth or falſehood of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that a malignant fever, not unlike ours, prevailed in Auguſt. In many of the towns of Virginia, fevers and agues have been much more prevalent and dangerous then they have been at former periods. Georgetown and its vicinity, which are in general very healthy, loſt,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:025255_0083_0FCCEDDACA110AA8"/>
in the courſe of a few weeks in ſummer, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exampled number of people by the flux, which diſorder has raged with great violence in many other places. The influenza has ſpread general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the union, and been very fatal. It has been twice in Vermont, where likewiſe the putrid ſore throat has carried off numbers. At Harriſburg and Middletown, in this ſtate, the flux and a putrid fever have been extremely deſtructive, and ſwept away, I am credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, a fifteenth part of the inhabitants. Delaware ſtate, particularly Kent county has ſuffered much from the flux, which has produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a very great mortality. And various other places have experienced a mortality, very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common, and which, but for the calamity of Philadelphia abſorbing public attention every where, would have created great alarms and uneaſineſs.</p>
            <p>Although the proceedings of many people in Philadelphia have been ſtrongly tinctured with cruelty, and a total direliction of every princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of humanity, yet the general conduct has not been ſo revolting as in London during the plague. In that city, when a houſe was known to
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:025255_0084_0FCCEDDC443EEA00"/>
have an infected perſon in it, it was faſtened up, and a guard placed at the door, to prevent any one from coming out, until after a quarantine of 40 days; and if, during that time, any other was infected, a new quarantine was impoſed. Thus entire families fell ſacrifices to an order, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſeleſs and cruel; and by theſe means, dead bodies lay often for weeks together in the moſt dreadful and noxious ſtate of putrefaction. Such revolting orders exiſted not in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. However, there have been various inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of houſes being left to the care of a ſervant or two, who fell ſick, and having no means of communicating their diſtreſſes to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, periſhed for want of aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>I have learned with great pleaſure, that a few landlords, commiſerating the diſtreſſes of their tenants, have come to the very humane reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of remitting the payment of rents du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the prevalence of the diſorder. Were they to enter into reſolutions generally to do the ſame, it would reflect honour on them. But there are ſome whoſe hardened hearts know no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and who will have
<q>the pound of fleſh—the penalty of the bond.</q>
Indeed,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:025255_0085_0FCCEDDDC2036D38"/>
when the diſorder was at the higheſt ſtage, ſome landlords ſeized the ſmall property of poor roomkeepers, who were totally unable to pay their rent. One man wrote to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, informing them that the poverty of his tenants rendered it impoſſible for them to pay him; he therefore begged the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee would, as they were appointed to relieve the poor, pay the arrearages due to him. Another perſon, a wealthy widow, produced recommendations for ſeveral poor roomkeepers, her tenants; and the committee gave them each a ſmall firm. As ſoon as they had received it, ſhe ſeized the money and their clothes!</p>
            <p>As I have been obliged to note a variety of horrid circumſtances, which have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to throw a ſhade over the human charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is proper to let in a little light on the ſubject, wherever juſtice and truth will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. Amidſt the general deſertion that prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there were to be found many illuſtrious inſtances of men and women, ſome in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, others in the lower ſpheres of life, who have, in the exerciſe of the duties of humanity, expoſed themſelves to dangers, which terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:025255_0086_0FCCEDDF30646998"/>
men, who have hundreds of times faced death without fear, in the field of battle. Some of them, alas! have fallen in the good cauſe! But why ſhould they be regretted! ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could they have fallen more gloriruſly. Foremoſt in this noble groups ſtands Joſeph In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkeep, a moſt excellent man in every of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial relations, of citizen, brother, huſband, and friend—To the ſick and the forſaken, whether he was acquainted with them or not, has he devoted his hours, to relieve and comfort them in their tribulation. Numerous are the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men reſtored, by his kind cares and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, to their families from the very jaws of death.—In various caſes has he been obliged to put dead bodies into coffins, when no other perſon could be had to perform that office. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Adgate's merit in the ſame way, was conſpicuous, and of the laſt importance to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of diſtreſſed creatures, bereft of every other comfort. Of thoſe worthy men, Wilſon, and Tomkins, I have already ſpoken. The rev. mr. Fleming and the rev. mr. Winkhauſe, exhauſted themſelves by a ſucceſſion of labours, day and night, attending on the ſick, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtering relief to their ſpiritual and temporal
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:025255_0087_0FCCEDE0A4702000"/>
wants. Of thoſe who have happily ſurvived their dangers, and are preſerved to their fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, I ſhall mention a few. They enjoy the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme reward of a ſelf-approving conſcience; and I readily believe, that in the moſt ſecret receſſes, remote from the public eye, they would have done the ſame. But next to the ſenſe of having done well, is, I believe, the approbation of our friends and fellow men; and when the debt is great, and the only payment that can be made is applauſe, it is ſurely the worſt ſpecies of avarice to withhold it. We are always ready, too ready to beſtow cenſure—and, as if anxious leſt we ſhould not give enough, we generally heap the meaſure. When we are ſo ſolicitous to deter by reproach from folly, vice, and crime, why not be equally diſpoſed to ſtimulate to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and heroiſm, by freely beſtowing the well-earned plaudit? The rev. Henry Helmuth's merits are of the moſt exalted kind. His whole time, during the prevalence of the diſorder, was ſpent in the performance of the works of mercy, viſiting and relieving the ſick, comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the afflicted, and feeding the hungry. Of his congregation, ſome hundreds have paid the laſt debt to nature, ſince the malignant fever
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:025255_0088_0FCCEDE229A489A8"/>
began; and, I believe, he attended nearly the whole of them. To ſo many dangers was he expoſed, that he ſtands a living miracle of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. The rev. C. V. Keating and the rev. mr. Uſtick have been in the ſame career, and performed their duties to the ſick with equal fidelity, and with equal danger. The venerable old citizen, Samuel Robeſen, has been like a good angel, indefatigably performing, in families where there was not one perſon able to help another, even the menial offices of the kitchen, in every part of his neighbourhood. John Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelly has ſpent hours beſide the ſick, when their own wives and children had abandoned them. Twice did he catch the diſorder—twice was he on the brink of the grave, which was yawning to receive him—yet, unappalled by the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger he had eſcaped, he again returned to the charge. I feel myſelf affected at this part of my ſubject, with emotions, in which I hope my reader will participate. And, as a human being, I rejoice that it has fallen to my lot, to be a witneſs and recorder of a magnanimity which would alone be ſufficient to reſcue the character of man from obloquy and reproach.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="unknown:025255_0089_0FCCEDE71A322570"/>Shall I be pardoned for paſſing a cenſure on thoſe, whoſe miſtaken zeal led them, during the moſt dreadful ſtages of this calamity, to croud ſome of our churches, and aid this frightful ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in his work of deſtruction? who, fearful leſt their prayers and adoration at home would not find acceptance before the Deity, reſorted to churches filled with bodies of contagious air, where with every breath they inhaled, they drew in noxious miaſmata? Surely yes. To this cauſe I am bold in aſcribing a large proportion of the mortality—And it is remarkable, that thoſe congregations, whoſe places of worſhip were moſt crouded, have ſuffered the moſt dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Will men never acquire wiſdom? Are we yet to learn that the Almighty architect of the heavens and the earth does not require
<q>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples made with men's hands?</q>
that going to a place of worſhip, againſt the great law of ſelf preſervation, implanted in indelible characters by his divine hand, on the breaſt of every one of his creatures, conſtitutes no part of the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration due to the maker and preſerver of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? That a "meek and humble heart"; the temple wherein he delights to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped? I hope not—I hope the awful leſſon ſome
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:025255_0090_0FCCD92D04B0D9F8"/>
of our congregations hold forth on this ſubject, by a mortality out of all proportion to their numbers, will ſerve as a memento at all future times, in the like critical emergencies!</p>
            <p>Of the number of citizens who fled away, it is difficult to form any accurate eſtimate. In the city, from Vine to South ſtreet, which has been ſurveyed by a man employed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, of 21,000 inhabitants, the number of abſent people is ſtated to be 8600. But as this buſineſs was ſeveral weeks performing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable variations muſt neceſſarily have taken place. The emigration was not finiſhed in thoſe ſtreets examined in the early part of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, —and towards the latter part, the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration had been already conſiderable. Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one to balance the other, and the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals in the liberties to have been equal to thoſe in the city, we ſhall probably nor err much when we eſtimate the number who left the city at about 17,000. This is not ſo many as I ſuppoſed when I laſt wrote on the ſubject<note n="*" place="bottom">Independent Gazetteer, October 26.</note>, at which time

I eſtimated them at 23,000. Which of the two is accurate, or whether either of them is ſo, I leave the reader to determine.</p>
            <p>Some of thoſe who remained in the city, have, for reaſons not very eaſy to juſtify, been in the habit of reproaching thoſe who fled, with criminality, as deſerters, who abandoned their poſts<note n="†" place="bottom">If they were even guilty of a crime, it brought its own puniſhment; as I am fully convinced that thoſe who were abſent, and a prey to the anxiety cauſed by the frightful reports current, ſuffered more than thoſe who remained. I ſpeak from experience. In a few days abſence, when the diſorder had not reached its ſummit, I heard more terrific accounts of it, than in as many weeks in Philadelphia, when it raged moſt violen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I believe, on the contrary, that as the nature of our government did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the arbitrary meaſures to be purſued, which, in deſpotic countries would probably have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed the diſorder at an early period —it was the duty of every perſon to avoid the danger, whoſe circumſtances and ſituation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it. The effects of the deſertion were,

moreover, ſalutary<note n="*" place="bottom">Perhaps had all our citizens remained, we ſhould have had famine added to our calamity; whereas we had plentiful markets during the whole time. The prices, too, were in general not far beyond what they are uſually at the ſame ſeaſon of the year.</note>. The ſphere of action of the diſorder was diminiſhed. Two or three empty houſes arreſted the diſeaſe in its progreſs, as it was ſlowly, but ſurely travelling through a ſtreet, and probably reſcued a neighbourhood from its ravages. We ſhall long have to mourn the ſevere loſs our city has felt, in being bereft of ſo many valuable citizens: and had the 17,000 who retired, been in the city during the prevalence of the diſorder, and loſt as large a proportion of their number, as thoſe did who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, we ſhould, inſtead of 4000 dead, have loſt nearly 6000; and perhaps had to deplore in the number, another Clow, a Kay, a Lea, a Sims, a Dunkin, a Strawbridge, men of exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive buſineſs, whoſe loſs will be long felt—a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington, a Glentworth, a Hutchinſon, a Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant, a Howell, men endowed by heaven with eminent abilities—a Fleming, a Graiſsl, a Sproat, men of exalted piety and virtue—a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

an Adgate, a Baldwin, a Carroll, a Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, citizens of moſt eſtimable characters. Let thoſe, then, who have remained, regard their long-abſent friends, as if preſerved from death by their flight, and rejoice at their return in health and ſafety—let thoſe who have been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, acknowledge the exertions of thoſe who maintained their ground. Let us all unite in the utmoſt vigilance to prevent the return of this fell deſtroyer, by the moſt ſcrupulous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to cleanſing and purifying our ſcourged city—and let us join in thankſgiving to that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, who has, in his own time, ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the avenging ſtorm, ready to devour us, after it had laughed to ſcorn all human efforts.</p>
