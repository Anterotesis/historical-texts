         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>MR. JOHN MURRAY, a little before his late <hi>evangelizing</hi> tour to the Eaſtward, while preaching, was pleaſed to inform his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, that he had been miſrepreſented as holding <hi>Univerſal Salvation</hi>; declaring he did not hold <hi>that</hi> doctrine, but only <hi>Univerſal Redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be proper to weigh Mr. <hi>Murray</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration in the <hi>balance</hi>; and to give him credit for all the truth there is in it.</p>
            <p>And here—not to inſiſt on his being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended at firſt, as one of Mr. <hi>Relly</hi>'s religion, who is the <hi>principal</hi> man for <hi>univerſal ſalvation</hi>; nor on his recommending Mr. <hi>Relly</hi>'s works in favour of <hi>that</hi> doctrine, as profitable for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Town, which he could not have done with a good conſcience, if he had not been <hi>like-minded:</hi> He himſelf for ſeveral months, hath been preaching univerſal ſalvation in Boſton, perhaps as plainly, as Mr. <hi>Relly,</hi> or any one elſe ever preached it in <hi>England.</hi> The doctrine, that all who ever have lived, or ſhall live on God's earth, ſhall be <hi>ſaved with an eternal ſalvation,</hi> is ſo contrary to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013998_0003_0F9258BDCDA44388"/>
the ſcripture, and ſo evidently tending to fill the world with ſin and wickedneſs of all kinds, that it is not to be wondered at, if the preachers of <hi>this goſpel,</hi> who cannot have a <hi>divine boldneſs,</hi> walk in <hi>craftineſs,</hi> and ſometimes would have people think they deny it; whereby they <hi>deceive the hearts of the ſimple.</hi> The foundation principle of the <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaliſts</hi> is, that ſince the human nature ſuffered, when Chriſt died, all that partake of it, let them be never ſo bad, are pardoned and dearly beloved of God. Mr. <hi>Murray,</hi> is as full in this, as Mr. <hi>Relly.</hi> For he declared lately, <hi>three times over,</hi> before ſome hundreds of witneſſes, that he held,— <hi>The Almighty loves all men on earth, even the moſt wicked and ungodly, as well as he loves true believers.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">How ſhocking this to chriſtian ears! Nay ſhocking to the Deiſts themſelves! He is not orthodox e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for <hi>them:</hi> For they look on it as a diſhonour to God to ſuppoſe vicious and wicked men are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in his favour.—Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> muſt make the matter up with his good friends as well as he can.</note> Now holding this <hi>univerſal love,</hi> is holding <hi>univerſal ſalvation.</hi> For if wicked men cannot, by all their wickedneſs, ſeparate themſelves from the love of God while they live; none will ſay they ever ſeparate themſelves from it, in that ſtate <hi>of darkneſs and ignorance,</hi> which is ſuppoſed to be aſſigned to them after death: They muſt therefore <hi>abide in the love of God</hi>; and as Mr. <hi>Relly</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>When Chriſt who is their life ſhall appear, they ſhall all appear with him in glory.</hi> I believe <hi>Logicians</hi> will ſay, the <hi>latter</hi> doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is inſeperably connected with the <hi>former.</hi>—
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013998_0004_0F9258BE68B28888"/>
This therefore would be enough to convict him: But beſides, the tenor of his preaching bears, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt him. It is obſervable, that wherever Mr. Murray goes, wiſe men are all of one mind, as to what the principles are which he preaches: In Boſton they ſee <hi>eye to eye</hi>; it is plain as the me<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ian ſun, that what he chiefly aims at, is to make people believe, that let them be never ſo wicked, God loves them as well as if they were the beſt of ſai<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s, and that whatever any may ſuffer in a ſtate of purgation, <hi>they</hi> at laſt, and <hi>all the world, ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oftentimes it requires no depth of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to know what his drift is; it is level to the meaneſt capacity: Which was particularly the caſe, in his long, irrational, wicked and waggiſh expoſition of the parable of the grain of muſtard ſeed, and the birds which lodged in the branches of it, when it grew up to a tree (Matth. chap. 13.) which made ſo much ſport for ſeveral evenings. All people of common ſenſe ſaw, his main deſign was to let them know, that when the birds, i. e. the devils, departed from the branches, i. e. men and women, which would be at the laſt day, then all the human race would be happy forever. It is to this very doctrine, that he owes his popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: By this he recommends himſelf to the ſons of infidelity. For a Deiſt looks upon a preacher, who is ſo free with the Bible, as to hold all men <hi>ſhall be ſaved,</hi> to be near a kin, and calls him bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his heart. In a word, young rakes, and old ſinners, thoſe who are hardned through the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013998_0005_0F92580E690B7240"/>
deceitfulneſs of ſin, and have no thoughts of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, muſt bear a warm ſide to him, for the benefit they receive from his labors; they are delivered from the qualms of conſcience, and walk in the broad way with greater comfort, becauſe they learn they can never ſin themſelves out of the love of God, and that if they ſerve the devil all their days, heaven will be their <hi>everlaſting home.</hi> But to proceed—</p>
            <p>Mr. Murray's denying, that he holds <hi>univerſal ſalvation,</hi> is the more aſtoniſhing, becauſe he hath declared, <hi>in ſo many words,</hi> that he looked on the opinion, that <hi>all ſhall be ſaved,</hi> to be the very doctrine of the Bible.</p>
            <p>In the narrative of his converſation with a young preacher, aſſiſtant to Mr. <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Norwich,</hi> Aug. 8. 1774. After Mr. Murray had ſaid, ſince our lives are hid with Chriſt in God, it is abſurd to ſuppoſe that any men are ſanctified or made holy in part (which alone ought to make chriſtians on their guard againſt him.) The dialogue proceeds in the following words: —Queſt. 4. Do you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that all mankind will partake of the life that is hid with Chriſt in God? Anſw. I hope ſo: I wiſh all men happy. Queſt. further. But is it your fixed opinion, that all mankind will be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, or ſaved with an everlaſting ſalvation? Anſw. The ſcriptures day ſo. Queſt. Where do they ſay ſo? Anſw. In many places; as 1. All fleſh ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God. And again, they ſhall all know me. And again, as in Adam all died,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013998_0006_0F9258C22F8F1C20"/>
ſo in Chriſt the ſecond Adam, ſhall all be made alive. And in thy ſeed, ſaith God to Abraham, (which ſeed intends Chriſt) ſhall all the families of the earth be bleſſed. <note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe texts rightly underſtood, don't help the cauſe at all: The true meaning of them may be found in the Expoſitions of Mr. Henry, Dr. Doddridge, and others.</note>

            </p>
            <p>The reader, will obſerve, that in this dialogue, Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> declares, <hi>univerſal ſalvation</hi> to be the <hi>very doctrine of the Bible:</hi> Which declaration is as contrary to that which he made from the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, Dec. 14. as the eaſt is to the weſt.</p>
            <p>As both parts of a contradiction cannot be true, that which he aſſerted at <hi>Norwich,</hi> or <hi>Boſton,</hi> muſt be <hi>falſe.</hi> The <hi>latter</hi> is ſo evidently falſe, that were he to ſay over a thouſand times what he ſaid in the pulpit, wiſe men, however bias'd in his favour, could not force themſelves to believe it. One would think this <hi>diſovery</hi> would be <hi>humbling,</hi> and that he would be ſhy of ſhewing his face again in that pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, where he was <hi>left</hi> to ſay, he did not hold all men ſhould be ſaved, even though he could get into it, without breaking open doors and windows, and appearing like a <hi>thief and a robber.</hi> But none of theſe things move him: He can put on a bold face, and make his hearers <hi>laugh</hi> and <hi>giggle</hi>; and while he is able to do this, he may be ſure of a train after him, in all populous places. His charging
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013998_0007_0F9258C34B3FEDB8"/>
one alſo with printing a falſehood, for ſaying he aſſerted, that thoſe who know themſelves to be the <hi>devil's children,</hi> and wicked men ought at the ſame time to believe <hi>they were God's beloved ones</hi>; had no more truth in it than the abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned declaration. And it is remarkable that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which protects the innocent, brought it to paſs, that he juſtified him whom he had accuſed with his own mouth, three times over, in the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. What is the reaſon this preacher hath ſo little regard to truth? It is the eaſieſt thing in the world to account for it: It is owing to the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which he preaches. According to <hi>him,</hi> if any ſhould be of the character of him, mentioned in the <hi>Spectator,</hi> who took pains to avoid ſpeaking truth, and ſhould lie like ſatan all their days, they would be as dear to God as any of his ſaints; and theſe <hi>beloved lyars,</hi> would at laſt be received into the heavenly manſions, which Chriſt as their forerunner, is gone to prepare for them! This is encouraging the lying buſineſs, quite as much as ſatan could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from a chriſtian preacher! Nor is there any doubt but any one who believes all this, would balk the truth, were he tempted to it, and thought none would ever know it, but God who loves all lyars ſo dearly, and will love them forever. The Popiſh religion encourages one ſort of lying; but this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages all ſorts. And there is full as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the men of <hi>this Creed,</hi> ſhould be diſquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed for taking an oath, as the <hi>Papiſts themſelves.</hi> And there is no doubt, but if God ſhould ſuffer it to ſpread in Europe and America, the legiſlature would take care, that the proſelytes ſhould be legally

incapacitated for any offices which required an oath, and for being evidences in any court of judicature. Nay, as hath been hinted, not only lying, but all ſorts of wickedneſs are promoted by this new goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. What glad tidings of great joy muſt it bring to drunkards, animating them to go on impover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing their families, deſtroying their health, and drowning reaſon and conſcience; to believe that the almighty hath no greater favourites on earth, than the greateſt <hi>ſots,</hi> and that if they ſhould die martyrs to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> they ſhall be raiſed to eternal life at the laſt day?</p>
            <p>The ſame may be ſaid of whoremongers and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers. No doubt a dreadful ſound is ſometimes <hi>in their</hi> ears, when they think of thoſe words; <hi>Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge</hi>; but how muſt they be heartned to believe that God loves them as well as if they were chaſte; and that they ſhall at laſt be preſented before the throne of Chriſt's glory with exceeding joy! It is eaſy to ſee that knaves, cheats, thieves and robbers, muſt be multiplied and encouraged, by the ſame comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble goſpel. To mention no more (I ſpeaks <hi>now</hi> only of the body) it is a <hi>murdering</hi> goſpel. How eaſily can ſatan perſuade a man to gratify his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, or avarice, by ſhedding his brother's blood, who believes that the words ſpoken to Daniel, O <hi>man greatly beloved of God,</hi> are applicable to every murderer; and that all murderers ſhall have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life? The ſhocking accounts we have heard or read of murders, are nothing for number to what they would have been, if this <hi>bloody</hi> goſpel had been
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013998_0009_0F9258C5D0104A18"/>
commonly received: And if God ſhould ſuffer the <hi>leaven</hi> to ſpread in the chriſtian world, one may foretell, without a ſpirit of propheſy, that thouſands and ten thouſands will be murder'd by it. Thoſe words of our Savior, by <hi>their fruits ye ſhall know them</hi>; are applicable to <hi>doctrines</hi> as well as to <hi>men.</hi> Paul tells the Coloſſians, the goſpel he preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them and others, brought forth <hi>fruit,</hi> i. e. the doctrine of life and ſalvation by <hi>faith in Chriſt:</hi> Whoever received it as a divine record, brought forth <hi>fruit unto God.</hi> But the goſpel that <hi>all men ſhall be ſaved, whether they believe or not,</hi> cauſes thoſe who embrace it, as we have ſeen, to bring forth <hi>fruit unto ſatan.</hi> And there is no doubt but ſatan would be glad to have ten thouſand preachers of it, ſpread up and down through all <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> And as ſuch preaching is ſo evidently inimical to all vertue, and productive of all vice, no one can be a conſiſtent friend to morality, who is <hi>not</hi> an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to it. The judicious have obſerved, that if it were really true, it would not be worth while for any to take pains in preaching it, ſince it would only make people in all reſpects worſe than they were before. It is remarkable that Mr. <hi>Relly</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (ſo great was the force of truth!) owned in a pamphlet which Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> anſwers,
<q>That the preaching of it, would not be for the glory of Chriſt, nor for the real happineſs of men.</q>
It ſeems as if it made him ſhudder to think of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible crop of wickedneſs which would be produced by ſowing <hi>that ſeed.</hi> And were Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> to inform him that not only vain, carnal, hardned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical perſons <hi>rejoiced in his light</hi>; but that ſome
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013998_0010_0F9258C68763B558"/>
FEW of a more ſerious character heard <hi>him gladly</hi>; it would not he good news <hi>from a far country,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he hath much more zeal for a bad cauſe, than he had when he wrote that piece.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs to ſay ſomething here of the pedigree of this doctrine of univerſal ſalvation. It is not the <hi>Proton Pſeudos</hi>; it is a derivative; it is the very bad offspring of as bad a parent. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental divinity to which it owes exiſtence (I will not mention the father's name) is, That the innocent Jeſus was not puniſhed for guilty men; and that becauſe the human nature ſuffer'd, when Chriſt ſuffer'd, all that partake of it, are pardon'd and loved of God. As if Chriſt did not <hi>his own ſelf,</hi> bear our ſins in his <hi>own body</hi> on the tree: This is deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord that bought us! All who ſwallow u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal ſalvation, ſwallows this blaſphemy <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Relly in his <hi>Union,</hi> for ſeveral pages together, argues from the truth, wiſdom, juſtice, holineſs and love of God, to prove 'tis abſolutely impoſſible to be true, that Jeſus Chriſt, who knew no ſin, was puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for guilty ſinners of Adam's race. This <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> which is a ſort of bible to the party, is about to ſee the light in America: It is to come out by thouſands, like the ſmoke of the bottomleſs pit, to hide the ſun light of the goſpel.</note> along with it. It is melancholy to think that the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this goſpel, ſo bad in its effects, as well as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree, ſhould meet with any encouragement in town or country! But, whatever other encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he meets with, he hath not the comfort to think that ſerious chriſtians, who know what he is after, pray for the bleſſing of God on his labors. For,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013998_0011_0F9258C7443E8C40"/>
how dares any one go into his cloſet and pray that God by his Spirit would influence people to believe it is the doctrine of the bible, that God loves the devil's children as well as his own; and that all Chriſt's implacable enemies when he comes the ſecond time to judge the world in righteouſneſs, ſhall be bleſſed and happy for ever? Serious admirers would tremble at this: And yet let me tell them, they cannot with a good conſcience encourage his preaching, unleſs they can find in their hearts, to pray this prayer. And it is not only melancholy, but very ſurprizing that ſome of Mr. Whitefield's zealous admirers in one place and another, ſhould receive this man as a teacher ſent from God. For what concord was thee between Mr. Whitefield and <hi>him</hi>? Mr. Whitefield preached much legal terror; this man none at all. Mr. Whitefield di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected awakened ſinners to get into a <hi>ſtate</hi> of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, by looking to Chriſt the antitype of the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen ſerpent: This man preaches all men are already in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of juſtification, without either faith or works.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Murray told the Public, he held, <hi>Juſtification by faith with works;</hi> and yet he knew as well as that he had a ſoul in his body, that he held what he was charged with, that men are in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of juſtification without faith, and without works too. This is moſt evident from his forementioned threefold declaration before a cloud of witneſſes, viz. 'that he held, that all men, even the moſt wicked &amp; ungodly under heaven, are intereſted in the love of God, as much as true believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers' What did he do with his conſcience? It is wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to talk deceitfully <hi>for God.</hi> But Mr. Murray imitates the pious frauds of the Romiſh Clergy, who eſtabliſh a <hi>falſe</hi> religion with <hi>falſehood.</hi>
               </note>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:013998_0012_0F9258C805B4B950"/>
Mr. Whitefield was forever preaching regeneration, and the neceſſity of our being ſanctified by the ſpirit: Mr. Murray holdss it to be abſurd to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any chriſtians on earth are ſanctified by the ſpirit of God. In a word, Mr. Whitefield, in his laſt viſit, condemned univerſal ſalvation as doctrine that <hi>peopled Hell!</hi> So that according to Mr. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, none go to heaven who believe Mr. Murray's goſpel! There is ſuch a thing as witchcraft in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. O fooliſh Galatians, who hath bewitched you? And all Mr. Whitefield's admirers, whom Mr. Murray can perſuade to admire him, may be ſaid to be <hi>bewitched</hi> by him.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid to be the plan, that Mr. Murray is to have a Society, and a <hi>Meeting Houſe,</hi> provided for him. But it cannot be ſuppoſed they will have a church. For they hold, <hi>the world is the church,</hi> and <hi>the church is the world</hi>; <note n="*" place="bottom">The word church in ſcripture, don't ſtand for all the world, but for thoſe who by profeſſion are ſeparated from it. The original word ſignifies thoſe who are gathered from among men. Nothing can be more abſurd, than to ſuppoſe all the world are gathered from among men. A right underſtanding of the meaning of that one <hi>Greek</hi> word, might have prevented a great deal of nonſence in <hi>preaching</hi> and <hi>printing.</hi> Poſſibly Mr. <hi>Relly,</hi> who hath us'd it ſo many years, may be unwilling to part with it; like the Popiſh prieſt, who ſaid, he would never part with his <hi>old Mumpſimus,</hi> for a <hi>new Sumpſimus.</hi>
               </note> and own all carnal, wicked and atheiſtical perſons to be their beloved brethren in Chriſt Jeſus. Nay, from their love to theſe diabolical members of <hi>their catholick</hi>

(worſe than <hi>Roman catholick</hi>) church, they conclude they are paſſed from death to life, and ſhall eſcape that <hi>Pugatory,</hi> which is to be the portion of others. Beſides we may argue they will have nothing to do with the low ordinances of baptiſm, and the Lord's ſupper, becauſe Oracle <hi>Relly,</hi> in his idolized ſermon on our <hi>life's being hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> ſpeaks very contemptibly of the ſpirituality of thoſe who mind theſe <hi>viſible things.</hi> One may venture to ſay of their intended ſociety, at leaſt what Mr. Relly ſaid of the preaching his own doctrine of univerſal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; 'that it would not be for the honor of Chriſt, nor the real happineſs of men.' Nor would any thing be more diſpleaſing to thoſe, who love the proſperity of Zion in this town and elſewhere. For they who make the cauſe of Chriſt their own, and love the ſouls of men, muſt feel their hearts pained within them to think, ſo great a corrupter of the word of God ſhould preach any where, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in populous places; and more particularly at ſuch a time as this. For New-England never ſaw ſo dark a day: It is a day of rebuke and diſtreſs from the Lord of hoſts, who dwelleth in mount Zion. The hearts of many are failing for fear; and God is calling us loudly by his providence, as well as word, to <hi>repent.</hi> But will Mr. Murray be of the character of thoſe preachers, whom Paul ſtyles <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers together with God?</hi> No: he will be a worker <hi>againſt God.</hi> He will perſuade people they have no <hi>need of repentance,</hi> by aſſuring them, if they ſerve the devil all their days, God will love them as well as if they ſerved him; and that if they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or are converted, their ſins ſhall be blotted out

when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord. <note n="*" place="bottom">In direct oppoſition to Acts 3d. v. 19. The reaſon why the Author don't multiply ſcripture paſſages againſt the impleaded doctrine is, that every honeſt man who reads the bible, muſt be able to bring an hundred plain texts, to prove, that only thoſe who believe in Chriſt, and repent of their ſins, will be bleſſed and happy at the reſurrection.</note>
            </p>
            <p>God's permitting this man to viſit theſe parts, and to ſow his tares ſo plentifully in this diſtreſſed town, is very puzzling. <hi>The ways of heaven are intricate and dark!</hi> But the ſcriptures not only aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us that there will be hereſies in the laſt days, but furniſhes us with a reaſon, 1 Cor. xi. ver. 19. <hi>For there muſt be alſo hereſies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifeſt among you:</hi> i. e. that ſuch honeſt hearts as will bear the trial may be ſet in view, and appear faithful by their conſtant adhering to the truth, notwithſtanding all temptations of ſeducers.</p>
            <p>This is the reaſon that this man hath been ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to viſit this land; and particularly this town, viz. that it might appear who would be carried away with every wind of doctrine, and embrace another goſpel; and who would hold faſt the form of ſound words delivered to us, and be like mount Zion that can never be moved. The Author, with ſuitable reſpect to his fellow chriſtians, would propoſe what appears to him the will of God on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>We learn from Joh. ii. epiſt. v. 10. That if any man bring not this goſpel, which Paul preached,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013998_0015_0F9258CCAA581E50"/>
(and we are ſure Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> doth not) we are not <hi>to receive him into our houſes,</hi> nor <hi>to wiſh him God ſpeed</hi>; i. e. any ways to encourage him as a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er It is a fault in thoſe who are fully convinced of the falſehood and danger of his doctrine, to hear him ſo much as once. To hear him for curioſity, or diverſion after ſuch conviction, is what no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious perſon will plead for. And we ſhould all pray to God for ourſelves (and others too) that we may be eſtabliſhed by him, and not ſuffered to fall from our own ſtedfaſtneſs. We ſhould pray, that we may be kept from believing the doctrine of <hi>vicarious puniſhment</hi> to be <hi>falſe,</hi> and from believing the doctrine of <hi>univerſal ſalvation</hi> to be <hi>true,</hi> in the face of a thouſand texts of ſcripture. We ſhould take heed of an undue biaſs from others, either in a way of hope or fear. And we ſhould ſee to it, that we don't indulge ourſelves in wiſhing the doctrine true, in hearing it preached, and making ourſelves of a party to promote it; leſt we be given up <hi>to believe a lie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here it may be ſaid, can't a man who believes <hi>that</hi> goſpel, be in a ſtate of ſalvation? How can he be, if he hopes for ſalvation only becauſe all ſhall be ſaved? This hope is not founded on the word of God, but on a contradiction to it, and cannot be the hope which <hi>maketh not aſhamed.</hi> It may be ſaid, <hi>Joy is a fruit</hi> of the ſpirit; and the proſelytes ſay, they never knew what ſpiritual joy meant, till they believed the <hi>glad tidings of great joy</hi>—that the <hi>whole world ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> informs us it was common in his day for thoſe who embraced
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013998_0016_0F9258CD6272A638"/>
dangerous errors to boaſt of their <hi>uncommon joys.</hi> It is one thing for a man's religion to make him glad; and another to have <hi>joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Satan can eaſily help them to <hi>ſtrong conſolations,</hi> who are under <hi>ſtrong deluſions.</hi> Only that joy can be from God, which is the effect of believing the <hi>goſpel of God,</hi> viz. that <hi>believers, and they only ſhall be ſaved.</hi> But may not they whoſe faith is of the operation of God, afterwards turn <hi>Univerſaliſts?</hi> It is not eaſy to conceive that they who have been taught by the word and ſpirit of God, ſhould embrace a religion ſo contrary to <hi>both.</hi> But if it were poſſible that one who had received Paul's goſpel <hi>as the word of God,</hi> ſhould afterwards receive Mr. Relly's goſpel as <hi>the word of God,</hi> it could be only for a time; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the elect might be finally deceived. The writer can never think, one who is not only almoſt, but altogether a chriſtian, will ever live and die a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever of the <hi>latter goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is time to think of a concluſion.— The author hath uſed great plaineſs of ſpecch, and been fervent in ſpirit: Which will need no excuſe with thoſe who realize that the glory of Chriſt, and the ſalvation of ſouls, are concerned in the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy. Nor is he careful about the event with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to himſelf: For one can never repent of what was done honeſtly for Chriſt, let the conſequences be what they will. His zeal hath not been againſt the <hi>Man,</hi> but againſt the <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He can ſay with <hi>confidence towards God,</hi> that he wiſhes Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> all happineſs in this world, and

               <hi>eternal</hi> life in that which is to come! And that in order to it, he may be a diſbeliever of his own Goſpel.</p>

            <p>I HAVE much ſorrow of heart, conſidering the ſtate of affairs among us.—I am far advanced in life, and labour under threatening maladies, and know not how ſoon I may be taken from you, and from this world. As one drawing near the eternal world, I would give you caution. "Take heed what you hear." The ſeeds of hereſy are ſowing and ſprouting up among us; and ſouls are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being ſeduced into errors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:013998_0018_0F9258D2265B4E30"/>There is one, who calls himſelf John Murray, who has declared the following things to be his ſettled opinion. —That the whole human race, every one of Adam's poſterity, have an intereſt in Chriſt, and are God's beloved ones—That the whole human race, every individual of mankind, ſhall be finally ſaved—That Judas ſhall ſit upon a throne in the kingdom of heaven—That at death the good go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to happineſs, and the bad into an intermediate ſtate, a place of miſery, to abide there for a certain ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but ſhall finally be ſav'd; which however dreſſed up in ſoft terms, and ſmooth expreſſions, is the very Popiſh purgatory.</p>
            <p>The ſubſtance of theſe things, and many other errors, he hath openly avowed and fully declared to be his ſentiments, at my houſe, in the hearing of many witneſſes. Theſe are unſcriptural tenets, and notwithſtanding all his perverting of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and wreſting and torturing the word of God, he was not able to produce one plauſible proof, nor one rational argument for the ſupport of theſe pernicious principles. They naturally lead to many other groſs errors and Popiſh abſurdities.—And they are extremely dangerous to the ſouls of men: They encourage, the wicked in their wickedneſs; for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe principles a man may live and die in ſin, and yet get to heaven at laſt; he may get drunk, and commit fornication and adultery; he may cheat, and ſteal, and lie, and indulge all manner of carnal gratifications and be ſaved notwithſtanding.— But you may ſay you don't diſcover any of theſe errors in his preaching—Why others who have beeen

accounted ſerious, diſcerning, judicious men, and whoſe judgment would heretofore have had ſome weight in your minds, have diſcovered them in his public diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>But however he ſeems artfully to hide them.— Your minds are not prepared to receive them; your affections muſt firſt be broke off from your miniſters, and your minds filled with prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, by their being reviled and vilified, and your affections ſet upon himſelf, and you brought to receive the words of his mouth with an implicit faith, then doubtleſs theſe dangerous doctrines, and many others will be inculcated.</p>
            <p>My brethren and friends, I muſt caution you to take heed and beware of falſe teachers—Beware, leſt ye be led away with errors, and fall from your ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs—Beware of falſe prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concerning whom our bleſſed Saviour hath warned us, "that if it were poſſible they ſhall deceive the very Elect."</p>
