         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT would now, be an unfaſhionable doctrine, whatever the ancient opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might be, to affirm that the conſtituent can bind his repreſentative by inſtructions; but tho' the obligatory force of theſe inſtructions is not inſiſted upon, yet their perſuaſive influence, in moſt c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>es, may be; for a repreſentative, who ſhould act againſt the explicit recommendation of his conſtituents, would moſt deſervedly forfeit their regard, and all pretenſion to their future confidence.</p>
            <p>When it is under deliberation, whether a new law ſhall be enacted, in which the electors of <hi>England</hi> are intereſted, <hi>THEY</hi> have notice of it, and an opportunity of declaring their ſenſe—<hi>THEY</hi> may point out every dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous tendency, and are not reſtrained in their repreſentations, from ſhewing in the plaineſt language, the injuſtice or oppreſſion of it.</p>
            <p>When a law in its execution is found to be repugnant to the genius of liberty, or productive of hardſhips or inconvenience, <hi>THEY</hi> may alſo inſtruct their deputies to exert themſelves in procuring a repeal of it, and in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of this right are not conſtrained to whine in the ſtyle of humble petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners.—<hi>THEY</hi> are expoſed to no danger in explaining their reaſons— <hi>THEIR</hi> ſituation does not become ſo delicate as to make it prudent, to weaken, by not urging them, with their full force, and to their utmoſt extent. But who are the repreſentatives of the colonies? To whom ſhall <hi>THEY</hi> ſend their inſtructions, when deſirous to obtain the repeal of a law ſtriking at the root and foundation of every civil right, ſhould ſuch an one take place? Inſtructions to all the members who compoſe the houſe of commons would not be proper. To them the application muſt be by petition, in which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The parliament of <hi>Henry</hi> III, or that of <hi>Henry</hi> VI, need not to be cited; there are many other inſtances, tho' not branded with epithets ſo remarkably opprobrious.</p>
            <p>In the opinion of a great lawyer, "an act of parliament may be void," and of a great divine,
<q>all men have natural, and freemen legal rights, which they may juſtly maintain, and no legiſlative power can deprive them of.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Caſes may be imagined in which the truth of theſe poſitions might, in theory, be admitted; but in practice, unleſs there ſhould be very peculiar circumſtances, ſuch as can't be ſuppoſed to exiſt during the prevalence of the power that introduced it, who would rely upon the authority of opinions, or the principle of them, for his protection againſt the penalties of <hi>any</hi> poſitive law?</p>

            <p>The advocates for the Stamp Act admit, in expreſs terms, that

            <p>How have they proved this poſition?

            <p>They argue, that
<q>the right of election being annexed to certain ſpecies of property, to franchiſes, and inhabitancy in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar places, a very ſmall part of the land, the property, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> are comprehended in thoſe deſcriptions.

The intereſts therefore of the non-electors, the electors, and the repreſentatives, are individually the ſame; to ſay nothing of the connection among neighbours, friends, and relations. The ſecurity of the non-electors againſt oppreſſion, is, that their oppreſſion will fall alſo upon the electors and the repreſentatives. The one can't be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, and the other indemnified.</p>
            <p>Further, if the non-electors ſhould not be taxed by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, they would not be taxed <hi>at all</hi>; and it would be iniquitous as well as a ſoleciſm, in the political ſyſtem, that they ſhould partake of all the benefits reſulting from the impoſition, and application of taxes, and derive an immunity from the circumſtance of not being qualified to vote. Under this conſtitution then, a double or virtual repreſentation may be reaſonably ſuppoſed. The electors, who are inſeparably connected in their intereſts with the non-electors, may be juſtly deemed to be the repreſentatives of the non-electors, at the ſame time they exerciſe their perſonal privilege in the right of election; and the members choſen, therefore, the repreſentatives of both. This is the only rational explanation of the expreſſion, <hi>virtual repreſentation.</hi> None has been advanced by the aſſertors of it, and their meaning can only be inferred from the inſtances, by which they endeavour to elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidate it, and no other meaning can be ſtated, to which the inſtances apply.</p>
            <p>It is an eſſential principle of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> conſtitution, that the ſubject ſhall not be taxed without his conſent, which hath not been introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by any particular law, but neceſſarily reſults from the nature of that mixed government; for, without it, the order of democracy could not exiſt.</p>

            <p>In earlier times there was more ſimplicity in the rules of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and men were more ſolicitous about the eſſentials, than the forms of it.

            <p>A reflection naturally ariſes from the inſtances cited:—When, on a particular occaſion, <hi>ſome</hi> individuals <hi>only</hi> were to be taxed, and not the <hi>whole</hi> community, <hi>their</hi> conſent <hi>only</hi> was called for, and in the laſt inſtance it appears, that they, who upon an occaſion of a general tax, would have been bound by the conſent of their <hi>virtual repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> (for in that caſe they would have had no <hi>actual repreſentatives</hi>) were in an affair calling for a <hi>particular</hi> aid from them, <hi>ſeparate</hi> from the reſt of the community, required to ſend their <hi>particular deputies</hi>: But how different would be the principle of a ſtatute, impoſing du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties without <hi>their</hi> conſent who are to pay them, upon the authority of <hi>their</hi> Gift, who ſhould undertake to give, what doth not belong to them.</p>

from this connection, and the neceſſity of imagining a double or virtual repreſentation, to avoid iniquity and abſurdity, have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained—the inhabitants of the colonies are, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> incapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing electors, the privilege of election being exerciſeable only in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and therefore if <hi>every</hi> inhabitant of <hi>America</hi> had the requiſite freehold, not <hi>one</hi> could vote, but upon the ſuppoſition of his ceaſing to be an inhabitant of <hi>America,</hi> and becoming a reſident of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> a ſuppoſition which would be impertinent, becauſe it ſhifts the queſtion—ſhould the colonies not be taxed by <hi>Parliamentary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,</hi> their reſpective legiſlatures have a regular, adequate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional authority to tax them, and therefore there would not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be an iniquitous and abſurd exemption, from their not being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by <hi>the houſe of commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is not that intimate and inſeparable relation between the <hi>elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of</hi> Great-Britain, and the <hi>Inhabitants of the colonies,</hi> which muſt inevitably involve both in the ſame taxation; on the contrary, not a ſingle <hi>actual</hi> elector in <hi>England,</hi> might be immediately affected by a taxation in <hi>America,</hi> impoſed by a ſtatute which would have a general operation and effect, upon the properties of the inhabitants of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies. The latter might be oppreſſed in a thouſand ſhapes, without any Sympathy, or exciting any alarm in the former, Moreover, even acts, oppreſſive and injurious to the colonies in an extreme degree, might become popular in <hi>England,</hi> from the promiſe or expectation, that the very meaſures which depreſſed the colonies, would give eaſe to the Inhabitants of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> It is indeed true, that the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of <hi>England</hi> and the colonies are allied, and an injury to the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies produced into all it's conſequences, will eventually affect the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther country; yet theſe conſequences being generally remote, are not at once foreſeen; they do not immediately alarm the fears, and engage the paſſions of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> electors; the connection between a freehol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and a <hi>Britiſh American</hi> being deducible only thro' a train of reaſoning, which few will take the trouble, or can have opportunity, if they have capacity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to inveſtigate; wherefore the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between the <hi>Britiſh Americans,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh electors,</hi> is a knot too infirm to be relied on as a competent ſecurity, eſpecially againſt the force of a preſent, counteracting expectation of relief.</p>
            <p>If it would have been a juſt concluſion, that the <hi>colonies</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly in the <hi>ſame</hi> ſituation with the <hi>non-electors</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> are <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> repreſented in the ſame manner; it ought to be allowed, that the reaſoning is ſolid, which, after having evinced a total <hi>diſſimilarity</hi> of ſituation, infers, that their repreſentation is <hi>different.</hi>

            <p>The objection having been ſtated, the anſwer is obvious and clear.</p>
            <p>The colonies have a complete and adequate legiſlative authority, and are not only repreſented in their aſſemblies, but in <hi>no other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> The power of making bye-laws veſted in the common council is inadequate and incomplete, being bounded by a few particular ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and the common council are actually repreſented too, by having a choice of members to ſerve in parliament. How then can the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the exemption from internal parliamentary taxations, claimed by the colonies, apply to the citizens of <hi>London?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The power deſcribed in the provincial charters, is to make laws, and in the exerciſe of that power, the colonies are bounded by no other limitations than what reſult from their ſubordination to, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon <hi>Great Britain.</hi> The term <hi>bye laws</hi> is as novel, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, when applied to the <hi>aſſemblies,</hi> as the expreſſion, <hi>acts of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> would be, if applied to the <hi>parliament</hi> of Great Britain; and it is as abſurd and inſenſible, to call a colony a common corporation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not an independent kingdom, and the powers of each to make laws and bye-laws, are limited, tho' not comparable in their extent, and the variety of their obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, as it would be to call lake <hi>Erie,</hi> a <hi>Duck-puddle,</hi> becauſe not the atlantic ocean.</p>
            <p>Should the analogy between the <hi>colonies</hi> and <hi>corporations</hi> be even admitted for a moment, in order to ſee what would be the conſequence of the <hi>poſtulatum,</hi> it would only amount to this, The <hi>colonies</hi> are veſted with as complete authority to all intents and purpoſes to tax them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as any <hi>Engliſh corporation</hi> is to make a bye-law, in any imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable inſtance for any local purpoſe whatever, and the <hi>parliament</hi> doth

not make laws for <hi>corporations</hi> upon ſubjects, in every reſpect proper for <hi>bye-laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I don't reſt the matter upon this, or any other circumſtance, however conſiderable, to prove the impropriety of a taxation by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> parliament. I rely upon the fact, that not one inhabitant in any colony is, or can be <hi>actually</hi> or <hi>virtually</hi> repreſented by the <hi>Britiſh houſe of commons,</hi> and therefore, that the Stamp duties are ſeverely impoſed.</p>
            <p>But it has been alledged, that if the right to <hi>give and grant</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the colonies by an internal taxation is denied by the houſe of commons, the ſubordination and dependence of the colonies, and the ſuperintendence of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> parliament can't be conſiſtently eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd.....That any ſuppoſed line of diſtinction between the two caſes, is but
<q>a whimſical imagination, a chimerical ſpeculation againſt fact and experience.</q>
......Now, under favour, I conceive there is more confidence, than ſolidity in this aſſertion; and it may be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily and eaſily proved, that the ſubordination and dependence of the colonies may be preſerved, and the <hi>ſupreme authority</hi> of the mother country be firmly ſupported, and yet the principle of repreſentation, and the right of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> houſe of commons flowing from <hi>it,</hi> to <hi>give and grant</hi> the property of the commons of <hi>America,</hi> be denied.</p>
            <p>The colonies are dependent upon <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the ſupreme authority veſted in the king, lords, and commons, may juſtly be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed to ſecure, or preſerve their dependence, whenever neceſſary for that purpoſe. This authority reſults from, and is implied in the idea of the relation ſubſiſting between <hi>England</hi> and her colonies; for, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the nature of human affections, the inferior is not to be truſted with providing regulations to prevent his riſing to an equality with his ſuperior. But, though the right of the ſuperior to uſe the proper means for preſerving the ſubordination of his inferior is admitted, yet it does not neceſſarily follow, that he has a right to ſeize the property of his inferior when he pleaſes, or to command him in every thing; ſince, in the degrees of it, there may very well exiſt a <hi>dependence</hi> and <hi>inferiority,</hi> without abſolute <hi>vaſſalage</hi> and <hi>ſlavery.</hi> In what the ſuperior may <hi>rightfully</hi> controul, or compel, and in what the inferior ought to be at liberty to act without controul or compulſion, depends upon the nature of the dependence, and the degree of the ſubordination; and, theſe being aſcertained, the meaſure of obedience, and ſubmiſſion, and the extent of the authority and ſuperintendence will be ſettled. When powers, compatible with the relation between the ſuperior and inferior, have, by expreſs compact, been granted to, and accepted by,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009958_0014_0F7B3EDDF6D60660"/>
the latter, and have been, after that compact, repeatedly recognized by the former— When they may be exerciſed effectually upon every occaſion without any injury to that relation, the authority of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior can't properly interpoſe; for, by the powers veſted in the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, is the ſuperior limited.</p>
            <p>By their conſtitutions of government, the colonies are empowered to impoſe internal taxes. This power is compatible with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and hath been expreſsly recognized by <hi>Britiſh</hi> miniſters and the <hi>Britiſh</hi> parliament, upon many occaſions; and it may be exerciſed effectually without ſtriking at, or impeaching, in any reſpect, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendence of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> parliament. May not then the line be diſtinctly and juſtly drawn between ſuch acts as are neceſſary, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for preſerving or ſecuring the dependence of the colonies, and ſuch as are not neceſſary or proper for that very important purpoſe?</p>
            <p>When the powers were conferred upon the colonies, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred too as privileges and immunities, and accepted as ſuch; or, to ſpeak more properly, the privileges belonging neceſſarily to them as <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubjects, were ſolemnly declared and confirmed by their charters, and they who ſettled in <hi>America</hi> under the encouragement and faith of theſe charters, underſtood, not only that They <hi>might,</hi> but that it was their <hi>right</hi> to exerciſe thoſe powers without controul, or preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In ſome of the charters the diſtinction is expreſſed, and the ſtrongeſt declarations made, and the moſt ſolemn aſſurances given, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ettlers ſhould not have their property taxed without their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by their repreſentatives; though their legiſlative authority is limited at the ſame time, by the ſubordination implied in their relation, and They are therefore reſtrained for making acts of aſſembly repugnan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to the laws of <hi>England</hi>; and, had the diſtinction not been expreſſed, the powers given would have implied it, for, if the parliament may in any caſe interpoſe, when the authority of the colonies is adequate to the occaſion, and not limited by their ſubordina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>Becauſe the parliament may, when the relation between <hi>Great Britain</hi> and her colonies calls for an exertion of her ſuperintendence, bind the colonies by ſtatute, therefore a parliamentary interpoſition in every other inſtance, is juſtifiable, is an inference that may be denied.</p>
            <p>On ſome emergencies, the king, by the conſtitution, hath an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power to provide for the ſafety of the ſtate; to take care, like a <hi>Roman</hi> dictator, <hi>ne quid detrimenti capiat reſpublica,</hi> [That the common
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009958_0015_0F7B3EDFF401ACC8"/>
wealth may not ſuffer.] and this power, is not ſpecifically annexed to the monarchy by any expreſs law; it neceſſarily reſults from the end and nature of government; but who would infer from this, that the king, in every inſtance, or upon every occaſion, can, upon the principles of the conſtitution, exerciſe this ſupreme power.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Britiſh miniſters</hi> have, in the moſt effectual terms, at different periods, from the reign of <hi>Charles</hi> II, to that of the preſent king, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized this diſtinction in their requiſitions, tranſmitted to the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to raiſe and levy men and money, by acts of aſſembly; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, in the courſe of the laſt war, they were ſo far from thinking that it was proper for the <hi>Britiſh houſe of commons</hi> to <hi>give and grant</hi> the property <hi>of the colonies</hi> to ſupport the military operations in <hi>America,</hi> upon which not only the immediate protection of that part of the <hi>Britiſh dominions,</hi> but the moſt important intereſts, perhaps the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate preſervation of <hi>Great Britain</hi> from deſtruction, eſſentially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended; I say, on this great occaſion of the moſt important, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional concernment, the <hi>Britiſh miniſters</hi> were ſo far from calling upon <hi>the houſe of commons,</hi> in their <hi>peculiar</hi> department, to <hi>give and grant</hi> property, belonging neither to themſelves, nor their conſtituents, that they directly applied to <hi>the colonies</hi> to tax themſelves, in virtue of the authority and privilege conferred by their charters, and promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to the <hi>Britiſh Parliament</hi> to reimburſe the expence they ſhould incur in providing for the general ſervice.......They made good their promiſe; and if all the money raiſed in the colonies, by acts of aſſembly, in purſuance of the requiſitions of the Britiſh miniſters, hath not been repaid by parliament, a very conſiderable part of it hath.</p>
            <p>Could they, who made the requiſitions I have mentioned, or the aſſemblies that complied with them, intend, or imagine the faith of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> government was to be preſerved by a retribution, at one time, of the money diſburſed at the inſtance, and upon the credit of the <hi>Britiſh miniſtry,</hi> enforced and ſupported by <hi>

                  </gap>oyal aſſurances,</hi> and by taking it back again at another time? is this method of keeping the faith of government to be ranked among the
<q>improvements which have been made beyond the idea of former adminiſtrations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by miniſters ignorant of the importance of the colonies, or who impotently neglected their concerns, or were diverted by mean purſuits, from attending to them?</q>
Is it abſolutely certain, that there never can, at any future period, ariſe a criſis, in which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of the colonies may be neceſſary; or, if there ſhould, that it
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009958_0016_0F7B3EE093D87D78"/>
will bring with it an oblivion of all former indirection?—But this is a ſubject fitter for ſilent meditation, than public diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p>There was a time when meaſures of prevention might have been taken by the colonies.—There may be a Time when redreſs may be obtained........Till then, prudence, as well as duty, requires ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
            <p>It is preſumed that it was a notable ſervice done by <hi>New-England,</hi> when the militia of that colony reduced <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> ſince it enabled the <hi>Britiſh miniſters</hi> to make a peace leſs diſadvantageous and inglorious than they otherwiſe muſt have been conſtrained to ſubmit to, in the humble ſtate to which they were then reduced.—That the general exertion <hi>of the colonies in North-America,</hi> during the laſt war, not only faciliated, but was indiſpenſably requiſite to the ſucceſs of thoſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations by which ſo many glorious conqueſts were atchieved, and that thoſe conqueſts have put it in the power of the preſent illuſtrious mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to make a peace upon terms of ſo much glory and adv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>An <hi>American,</hi> without juſtly incurring the imputation of ingratitude, may doubt, whether ſome other motive, beſides pure generoſity, did not prompt the <hi>Britiſh Nation</hi> to engage in the defence of the colonies. He may be induced to think that the meaſures taken for the protection of the plantations, were not only connected with the intereſts, but even neceſſary to the defence of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> herſelf, becauſe he may have reaſon to imagine that <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> could not long ſubſiſt as an independent kingdom after the loſs of her colonies.—He may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out arrogance, be inclined to claim ſome merit from the exertion of colonies, ſince it enabled <hi>Great Britain</hi> ultimately to defend herſelf; I mean that kind of merit which ariſes from benefits done to others, by the operation of meaſures taken for our own ſakes......a merit moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtriouſly diſplayed in the generoſity of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> when, with their co-operation, ſhe protected the colonies to preſerve <hi>herſelf.</hi>

            <p>The national debt is heavy, and it is a popular ſcheme to draw from colonies a contribution towards the relief of the mother-country.

The colonies, for a long courſe of time, have largely contributed to the public revenue, and put <hi>Great-Britain</hi> to little or no expence for their protection. If it were equitable to draw from them a further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, it does not therefore follow, that it is proper to force it from them, by the harſh and rigorous methods eſtabliſhed by the ſtamp act; an act unequal and diſproportioned to <hi>their</hi> circumſtances whom it affects; exempting opulence, cruſhing indigence; and tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a numerous, loyal, and uſeful people, the privileges they had, in their opinion, earned and merited, and juſtly held moſt dear. If they are really in debt, the payment of it hath not been refuſed, it hath not been demanded.

There was a ſtatute of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, by which, I think, the king's proclamations, with the conſent of the privy council, were to operate as laws; and another ſtatute of <hi>Richard</hi> II, that the power of the two houſes ſhould be veſted in twelve lords; but theſe acts bear <hi>no reſemblance</hi> to the ſtamp-act.</p>
            <p>The ſtamping inſtruments are to be retained in <hi>England.</hi> Vellum, parchment, and paper, are to be ſent to <hi>America,</hi> ready ſtamped........ The firſt commiſſioner of the treaſury, or the commiſſioners, or any three or more of them, are, by the act, impowered to ſet <hi>any</hi> price upon the vellum, parchment and paper, and the payment of that price is ſecured and enforced by the <hi>ſame</hi> pains and penalties that the ſtamp-duties are.</p>
            <p>If the ſubſtitution of an arbitrary civil law court, in the place of the legal judicatories, and that deſerved favourite, the common-law-trial by jury, would not juſtify the aſſertion, that the ſtamp-act hath ſtripped the colonies of the guards and ſecurities provided by the conſtitution againſt oppreſſion in the execution of laws, I would much leſs preſume to ſay, the veſting in the commiſſioners of the treaſury a power to tax the colonies, will amply juſtify the aſſertion, that the ſtamp-act hath not left them even the ſhadow of a privilege. It is indeed ſomething difficult to imagine how the order of democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which is as much a part of the conſtitution, as monarchy or ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracy, can exiſt when the people are excluded from a ſhare in the executing, and a ſhare in the making of laws; but that is <hi>not</hi> the preſent caſe; and, though I may not be able to anſwer a ſpecious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, formed upon general principles, I am not obliged to adopt it, 'till I am convinced of its ſolidity.</p>

            <p>The truth is, that a vaſt revenue ariſes to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> nation from taxes paid by the colonies <hi>in Great-Britain,</hi> and even <hi>the moſt ignorant</hi> Britiſh <hi>cottager,</hi> not impoſed upon by infamous miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt perceive, that it is of no conſequence to his eaſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, whether the duties raiſed upon <hi>America</hi> are paid <hi>there,</hi> and thence afterwards remitted to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> or paid <hi>at firſt</hi> upon the produce of the colonies in <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>

            <p>In the article of tobacco, for inſtance, the planter pays a tax upon that produce of his land and labour conſumed in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> more than ſix times the clear ſum received by him for it, beſides the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of freight, commiſſion and other charges, and double freight, commiſſion and charges upon the tobacco re-exported, by which the <hi>Britiſh</hi> merchants, mariners and other <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubjects, are ſupported —a tax, at leaſt, equal to what is paid by any farmer of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> poſſeſſed of the ſame degree of property; and moreover the planter muſt contribute to the ſupport of the expenſive internal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the colony, in which he <note n="*" place="bottom">See the appendix<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>The right of exemption from all taxes <hi>without their conſent,</hi> the colonies claim as <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubjects.

or by any other power, they are at the ſame time deprived of every privilege diſtinguiſhing free-men from ſlaves.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, they acknowledge themſelves to be ſubordinate to the mother country, and that the authority veſted in the ſupreme council of the nation, may be juſtly exerciſed to ſupport and preſerve that ſubordination.</p>
            <p>Great and juſt encomiums have been beſtow'd upon the conſtitution of <hi>England,</hi> and their repreſentative is deſervedly the favourite of the inhabitants in <hi>Britain.</hi> But it is not becauſe the ſupreme council is called <hi>parliament,</hi> that they boaſt of their conſtitution of government; for there is no particular magical influence from the combination of the letters which form the word; it is becauſe they have a ſhare in that council, that they appoint the members who conſtitute one branch of it, whoſe duty and intereſt it is to conſult their benefit, and to aſſert their rights, and who are veſted with an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to prevent any meaſures taking effect dangerous to their liberties, or injurious to their properties.</p>
            <p>But the inhabitants in the colonies have no ſhare in this great coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. None of the members of it are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or can be of their appointment, or in any reſpect dependant upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

To deny the authority of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> legiſlature, is to ſurrender all claim to a ſhare in its councils, and if this were the tenor of their charters, a grant more inſidious or replete with miſchief, could not be imagined, a forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their rights would be couched under the appearance of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<q>if the common law of <hi>England,</hi> is to be brought, as juſtifying a claim of exemption in any ſubject of <hi>Great Britain</hi> from a parliamentary tax, it will plead againſt a tax impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a provincial aſſembly; for as all the colony aſſemblies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their authority from the meer grant of the crown only, it might be urged that any tax impoſed by them, is impoſed by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the prerogative of the crown, and not by full conſent of parliament. That if this right in the crown, is acknowledged to exempt the ſubject from the juriſdiction of parliament in the caſe of taxation, its power to diſpenſe with acts of parliament, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the ſame ſubject of the benefit of the common law, can't be denied.</q>
            </p>
            <p>One would be inclined to ſuſpect that it is ſuppoſed, ſomething elſe than reaſon, may on this occaſion conduce to perſuaſion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſubjects, who left their <hi>native</hi> country to ſettle in the wilderneſs of <hi>America,</hi> had the privileges of <hi>other Engliſhmen.</hi> They knew their value, and were deſirous of having them perpetuated to their poſterity. They were aware that, as their conſent whilſt they ſhould reſide in <hi>America,</hi> could neither be aſked nor regularly given in the national legiſlature, and that if they were to be bound by laws without reſtriction, affecting the property they ſhould earn by the utmoſt hazard and fatigue, they would loſe every other privilege which they had enjoyed in their native country, and become meer tenants at will, dependant upon the moderation of their lords and maſters, without any other ſecurity....that as their ſettlement was to be made under the protection of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> government, they knew, that in conſequence of their relation to the mother-country, they and their poſterity would be ſubordinate to the ſupreme national council, and expected that obedience and protection would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as reciprocal duties.</p>
            <p>Conſidering themſelves, and being conſidered in this light, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a compact with the crown, the baſis of which was, <hi>that their privileges as</hi> Engliſh <hi>ſubjects, ſhould be effectually ſecured to themſelves, and tranſmitted to their poſterity.</hi> As for this purpoſe, preciſe declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and proviſions formed upon the principles, and according to the ſpirit of the <hi>Engliſh conſtitution</hi> were neceſſary; CHARTERS were accordingly framed and conferred by the crown, and accepted by the ſettlers, by which all the doubts and inconveniencies which might have ariſen from the application of general principles to a new ſubject, were prevented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:009958_0029_0F7B3EEB76DA4450"/>By theſe charters, founded upon the unalienable rights of the ſubject, and upon the moſt ſacred compact, the colonies claim a right of exemption from taxes <hi>not impoſed with their conſent.</hi>—They claim it upon the principles of the conſtitution, as once <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and now <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubjects, upon principles on which their compact with the crown was originally founded.</p>
            <p>The origin of other governments is covered by the veil of antiquity, and is differently traced by the fancies of different men; but, of the colonies, the evidence of it is as clear and unequivocal as of any other fact.</p>
            <p>By theſe declaratory charters the inhabitants of the colonies claim an exemption from <hi>all</hi> taxes not impoſed by their own conſent, and to infer from their objection to a taxation, to which their conſent is not, nor can be given, <hi>that they are ſetting up a right in the crown to diſpenſe with acts of parliament, and to deprive the</hi> Britiſh <hi>ſubjects in</hi> America <hi>of the benefits of the common law,</hi> is ſo extremely abſurd, that I ſhould be at a loſs to account for the appearance of ſo ſtrange an argument, were I not apprized of the unworthy arts employed by the enemies of the colonies to excite ſtrong prejudices againſt them in the minds of their brethren at home, and what groſs incongruities prejudiced men are wont to adopt.</p>
            <p>Tho' I am perſuaded that this reaſoning hath already been ſufficiently refuted, and that no ſenſible and diſpaſſionate man can perceive any force in it, yet I can't help remarking, that it is grounded upon a principle, which, if it were poſſible for the examiner to eſtabliſh it, would entitle him to the applauſe of the inhabitants in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> as little as to the thanks of the colonies.</p>
            <p>From what ſource do the peers of <hi>England</hi> derive their dignity, and the ſhare they have in the <hi>Britiſh legiſlature?</hi> are there no places in <hi>England</hi> that derive their power of chuſing members of parliament from royal charters? will this writer argue, that the crown may, by prerogative, tax the inhabitants of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> becauſe the peers of <hi>England,</hi> and ſome repreſentatives of the people, exerciſe a legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative authority under royal patents and charters? it muſt be admitted that all the members of the houſe of commons are freely choſen by the people, and are not afterwards ſubject to any influence of the crown or the miniſtry: And are not the members of the lower houſes of aſſembly as freely choſen alſo by the people; and, in fact, as inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, as the members of the houſe of commons? if the truth were confeſſed, the objection would not be, <hi>that the colonies are too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon the crown,</hi> or that their claim of exemption from all taxes,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009958_0030_0F7B3EEED3F3DD48"/>
not impoſed by their own conſent, <hi>is founded upon a principle leading to ſlavery.</hi> At one time, the <hi>North-Americans</hi> are called <hi>republicans</hi>; at another, <hi>the aſſertors of deſpotiſm.</hi> What a ſtrange animal muſt a <hi>North American</hi> appear to be from theſe repreſentations to the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Engliſh</hi> readers, who have never had an opportunity to admire, that he may be neither black, nor tawny, may ſpeak the <hi>Engliſh</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and, in other reſpects, ſeem, for all the world, like one of them!</p>
            <p>"The common-law, the great charter, the bill of rights," are ſo far from
<q>declaring, with one voice, that the inhabitants of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies ſhall be taxed by no other authority than that of the <hi>Britiſh parliament,</hi>
               </q>
that they prove the contrary; for the principle of the common law is, <hi>that no part of their property ſhall be drawn from</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh <hi>ſubjects, without their conſent, given by thoſe whom they depute to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them</hi>; and this principle is enforced by the declaration of the GREAT CHARTER, and <hi>the bill of rights,</hi> neither the one nor the other, introducing any <hi>new</hi> privilege. In <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> the conſent of the people is given by the houſe of commons; and, as money had been levied there for the uſe of the crown <hi>by pretence of prerogative, without their conſent,</hi> it was properly declared at the revolution, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the conſtitution, and in vindication of the people's rights, that the levying of money, by <hi>pretence of prerogative,</hi> without grant of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <hi>i. e.</hi> without their conſent who are to pay it, is illegal, which declaration was moſt ſuitable to the occaſion, and effectually eſtabliſhes the very principle contended for by the colonies.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>parliament,</hi> having been made uſe of, the <hi>letter</hi> of the declaration is adhered to, and the conſequence drawn, that no <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubject can be legally taxed, but by the authority of the <hi>Britiſh parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> againſt the ſpirit and principle of the declaration, which was aimed only to check and reſtrain the <hi>prerogative,</hi> and to eſtabliſh the neceſſity of obtaining <hi>the conſent</hi> of thoſe on whom taxes were to be levied. Is not this a new kind of logic, to infer from declarations and claims, founded upon the neceſſary and eſſential principle of a free government, that the people ought not to be taxed without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that therefore the colonies ought to be taxed by an authority, in which their conſent is not, nor can be concerned; or, in other words, to draw an inference from a declaration or claim of privilege, ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the very principle upon which the privilege is founded? How aukwardly are the principles of the revolution applied by ſome men! What aſtoniſhment would the promoters of that glorious meaſure, thoſe patrons and friends of liberty, did they now tread the ſtage of

            <p>It was declared alſo by the <hi>bill of rights,</hi> that the elections of <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of parliament</hi> ought to be free, and the common law laid down the ſame rule before, which is as applicable to the election of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the colonies, as of the commons of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> But with the help of the examiner's logic, it might be proved from the <hi>letter</hi> of the <hi>bill of rights,</hi> that the elections <hi>only</hi> of <hi>members of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> ought to be free; for the freedom expreſſed in the bill of rights, is as much attached to elections of members of parliament, as the authority to grant money is to <hi>the</hi> Britiſh <hi>parliament,</hi> and if the declaration in the one caſe implies a negative, there is the like impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the other. If, moreover, the common law, the great char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the bill of rights, do really, as the examiner aſſerts, with one voice declare, that the inhabitants of the colonies ought to be taxed <hi>only</hi> by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> parliament, it is not conſiſtent with that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of vigilance, and jealouſy of their power, commonly aſcribed to the <hi>Britiſh parliament,</hi> that, from their firſt regular ſettlement to the reign of <hi>George</hi> III, the <hi>American</hi> aſſemblies ſhould not only have been ſuffered, without any animadverſion, without one reſolve, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a ſingle motion to reſtrain them, to encroach upon the juriſdiction and authority of the <hi>Britiſh parliament</hi>; but that the parliament ſhould never before the late <hi>ſtamp-act,</hi> in one inſtance, have impoſed an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal tax upon the colonies for <hi>the ſingle purpoſe of revenue,</hi> and that, even when acts of aſſembly paſſed in conſequence of miniſterial inforced by royal requiſitions have been laid before them, they ſhould be ſo far from objecting to their validity, as actually to recognize the authority of the provincial legiſlatures, and upon that foundation ſuperſtruct their own reſolves and acts.</p>
            <p>But tho' it hath been admitted, that the <hi>ſtamp-act</hi> is the firſt ſtatute that hath impoſed an internal tax upon the colonies <hi>for the ſingle pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of revenue,</hi> yet the advocates for that law contend, that there are many inſtances of the parliament's exerciſing a ſupreme legiſlative au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the colonies, and actually impoſing <hi>internal taxes</hi> upon their properties—that the duties upon any exports or imports are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal taxes—that an impoſt on a foreign commodity is as much an
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:009958_0032_0F7B3EF0011CC658"/>
internal tax, as a duty upon any production of the plantations,......that no diſtinction can be ſupported between one kind of tax and another, an authority to impoſe the one extending to the other.</p>
            <p>If theſe things are really as repreſented by the advocates for the <hi>ſtamp</hi> act, why did <note n="*" place="bottom">I have preſumed to mention this fact upon the authority of private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, as well as of the news papers, and other publications; and tho' the chancellor of the exchequer is not named, yet the fact ſeems in general to be referred to in the poſtſcript to <hi>the excellent letter concerning libels, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, ſeizure of papers, and ſecurity of the peace, &amp;c.</hi> in the following words:

This was reſolved too, if I am informed right, at the cloſe of the night, and the riſing of the houſe; ſo that every body muſt have taken it as a clear thing, that they could at any time come to a reſolution upon any general point of law, whenever they ſhould ſee it <hi>expedient</hi> ſo to do, <hi>ſed verbum ſapienti ſat eſt; but a word is enough to the wiſe.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It appears to me, that there is a clear and neceſſary diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an act impoſing a tax for <hi>the ſingle purpoſe of revenue,</hi> and thoſe acts which have been made for the regulation of trade, and have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſome revenue <hi>in conſequence of their effect</hi> and operation as <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The colonies claim the privileges of <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubjects......it has been proved to be inconſiſtent with thoſe privileges, to tax them <hi>without their own conſent,</hi> and it hath been demonſtrated that a tax impoſed by parliament, is a tax <hi>without their conſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſubordination of the colonies, and the authority of the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to preſerve it, have been fully acknowledged. Not only the welfare, but perhaps the exiſtence of the mother country, as an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent kingdom, may depend upon her trade and navigation, and theſe ſo far upon her intercourſe with the colonies, that, if this ſhould
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009958_0033_0F7B3EF0CFAE4C28"/>
be neglected, there would ſoon be an end to that commerce, whence her greateſt wealth is derived, and upon which her maritime power is principally founded. From theſe conſiderations, the right of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh parliament</hi> to regulate the trade of the colonies, may be juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; a denial of it would contradict the admiſſion of the ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of the authority to preſerve it, reſulting from the nature of the relation between the mother country and her colonies. It is a common, and frequently the moſt proper method to regulate trade by duties on imports and exports. The authority of the mother country to regulate the trade of the colonies, being unqueſtionable, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations are the moſt proper, are to be of courſe ſubmitted to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the parliament; and, if an <hi>incidental revenue,</hi> ſhould be produced by ſuch regulations; theſe are not therefore unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>A right to impoſe an internal tax on the colonies, without their conſent <hi>for the ſingle purpoſe of revenue,</hi> is denied, a right to regulate their trade without their conſent is admitted. The impoſition of a duty, may, in ſome inſtances, be the proper regulation. If the claims of the mother country and the colonies ſhould ſeem on ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to interfere, and the point of right to be doubtful, (which I take to be otherwiſe) it is eaſy to gueſs that the determination will be on the ſide of power, and that the inferior will be conſtrained to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <note n="*" place="bottom">In the reign of our great deliverer, when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> were at war with <hi>France</hi>

            <p>The writer on the regulations lately made with reſpect to the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, who is ſaid to have been <hi>well informed,</hi> aſſerts a fact, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputably proves, that the impoſitions mentioned, were <hi>only</hi> regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of trade, and can, with no kind of propriety, be conſidered in any other light. The fact he aſſerts, is, that
<q>the whole remittance from all the taxes in the colonies, at an average of thirty years, has not amounted to 1900 <hi>l.</hi> a year, and in that ſum, 7 or 800 <hi>l. per annum</hi> only, have been remitted from <hi>North-America</hi>; and that

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It would be ridiculous indeed to ſuppoſe, that the parliament would raiſe a revenue by taxes in the colonies to defray part of the national expence, the collection of which taxes would increaſe that expence to a ſum more than three times the amount of the revenue; but, the impoſitions being conſidered in their true light, as regulations of trade, the expence ariſing from an eſtabliſhment neceſſary to carry them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to execution, is ſo far from being ridiculous, that it may be wiſely incurred.</p>
            <p>The author of the claim of the colonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> gives (as hath been obſerved) the epithets of <hi>unjuſt</hi> and <hi>partial,</hi> to a tax which ſhould be impoſed upon the non-electors, only in <hi>Britain,</hi> and in that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, proves, that a tax upon the non-electors in the colonies, is more unjuſt and partial, and yet undertakes to defend the juſtice of it; and the writer on the regulations of the colonies declares, that it is in vain to call the acts he has cited as precedents, by the name of mere regulations, notwithſtanding he hath irrefragably proved, that they are ridiculous, if conſidered in any other light.

            <p>It is very obſervable, that in applying this ſtatute, a language is made uſe of, which gives the idea of violence; and it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that great aggravation of features, and ſtrong colouring, were neceſſary to make it in any d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It would be uſeleſs, as well as tedious, to point out every miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation in this application, ſince that will be effectually done, by briefly ſhewing the effect of the 5th Geo. II, and ſuggeſting the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of making that ſtatute.</p>
            <p>Lands, negroes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the plantations, are made aſſets for the ſatisfaction of all debts owing to his majeſty, or <hi>any of his ſubjects,</hi> in like manner as real eſtates are, by the law of <hi>England</hi> liable to the ſatisfaction of debts due by ſpecialty.</p>
            <p>If the creditor reſides in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> the affidavits of his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes taken there, are to be allowed as evidence, and to have the ſame force their teſtimony would have, if given, <hi>vivâ voce,</hi> in open court.</p>
            <p>The evidence mentioned in the ſtatute, prevailed in moſt, if not all the colonies, before the ſtatute, and lands were alſo liable to the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all debts in moſt inſtances, by the method practiſed alſo in the court of chancery in <hi>England,</hi> of marſhalling aſſets. In ſome of the colonies, without this circuity, lands were immediately liable to ſimple contract debts.</p>
            <p>Independent of the ſtatute, when the creditor obtains a judgment againſt his debtor, <hi>all</hi> his lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> over which he has a <hi>diſpoſing</hi> power, are liable, and, ſince the ſtatute, only <hi>ſuch</hi> lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are aſſets, as the debtor had a power to diſpoſe of. It appears then, that all the effects of the ſtatute on this head, is to ſubject real eſtates to the payment of debts <hi>after</hi> the death of the debtor, (for the moſt part the caſe before the ſtatute) which might have been made ſubject <hi>before</hi> his death.</p>
            <p>In many of the colonies, the provincial creditors of deceaſed debtors, were preferred to the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> in the ſame degree, by acts of aſſembly
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:009958_0036_0F7B3EF376E9C510"/>
which carried the appearance of partiality; tho' in fact, the effect of the laws of <hi>England</hi> gave riſe to them; for, upon bankruptcies in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> the ſteps required by the ſtatutes to entitle creditors to a ſatisfaction, effectually exclude colony creditors in moſt caſes, and their diſtance, when their debtors die in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> where colony creditors have not ſtanding agents as the merchants have in the planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and there happens a deficiency of aſſets, ſhuts them out like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from all chance of ſatisfaction in the uſual ſcramble among cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors for the debtor's eſtate on ſuch events.</p>
            <p>In ſome of the colonies they changed, by acts of aſſembly, certain ſpecies of perſonal property, <hi>e. g.</hi> negroes, into the nature of real eſtates, by making them deſcendible; and, by this alteration of the common law, and confuſion of the former diſtinction of property, very conſiderably diminiſhed the perſonal fund liable to <hi>all</hi> debts.</p>
            <p>As theſe circumſtances were repreſented and believed to be great diſcouragements to the trade of the mother country, after repeated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions to provide a remedy in the colonies, in which the grievance was moſt ſenſibly felt, had been diſregarded, the ſtatute was finally made.</p>
            <p>This was, without doubt, a ſubject upon which the ſuperintendence of the mother-country might be juſtly exerciſed; it being relative to her trade and navigation, upon which her wealth and her power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, and the preſervation of her ſuperiority, and the ſubordination of the colonies, are ſecured, and therefore is comprehended in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction.</p>
            <p>After citing, and applying this ſtatute, the examiner takes occaſion to inſult a gentleman of a moſt amiable and reſpectable character, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he preſumed it ſeems, to queſtion the univerſality of parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary power, and appears to be ſo totally occupied in the buſineſs of defamation, as not to be aware of his running into the moſt egregious inconſiſtencies. If the examiner is a lawyer, he has betrayed the moſt ſhameful ignorance; if an agent, the moſt infamous unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Had the <hi>American Chief Juſtice</hi> acted in <hi>England,</hi> as too many of his countrymen have done—had he paid his court to power, by mean compliances, and endeavoured to recommend himſelf, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting accuſations againſt the colonies, by repreſenting the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in them, as a refractory, diſloyal, and rebellious people, and by propoſing ſchemes for their depreſſion—had he not firmly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his character of honour and probity, we ſhould not have ſeen

            <p>"Had the colonies," ſays the examiner,
<q>agreed to the impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtamp-duties, a precedent would have been eſtabliſhed for their being conſulted, before any impoſition upon them by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament would hereafter take place.</q>
He intimates that they were adviſed by ſome of their agents to take this courſe: If ſuch advice hath been given, it was weak or inſidious, and the agents, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended the meaſure, ought to be removed for their incapacity or their treachery.</p>
            <p>How would the precedent have been eſtabliſhed, or, if it had, what would have been the advantage? This conduct would have admitted, that the colonies might be taxed at any time, and in any manner, without their conſent; and conſequently, would at once have been an effectual ſurrender of all their privileges as <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubjects.</p>
            <p>If precedents were to be regarded, when a tax in <hi>America,</hi> for the <hi>ſingle purpoſe of revenue</hi> is required, they are not wanting. Upon ſuch occaſions, the courſe hath always, and uniformly been, 'till the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the ſtamp duties, to tranſmit requiſitions to the colonies; and, if the inſtance cited by the examiner, is, in any degree pertinent, he has ſhewn in his appendix, that the method of requiſition was <hi>in that</hi> purſued; for, the lords of trade, in their report, expreſly mention the refuſal of the colonies to comply with the requiſitions tranſmitted to them, to remove the grievance complained of.</p>
            <p>The clauſe in the mutiny act during the late war is alſo relied upon, but with how much propriety, few words will evince.</p>
            <p>The acts of aſſembly of each colony, could have no obligatory force beyond the limits of each; but the ſervice of the colony troops, was not confined within the ſame colony in which they were raiſed; it is therefore evident that the provincial legiſlatures, had not an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority adequate to the great object of the military operations in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> which was not merely the defence of the plantations, by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures executed within their boundaries, but the enemy was attacked
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:009958_0038_0F7B3EF496EE6838"/>
in his own country, and for this purpoſe the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>American</hi> troops acted conjunctly. On this occaſion it was not only conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that the troops employed in the ſame ſervice, ſhould be ſubject to the ſame diſcipline, but it was indiſpenſably neceſſary that this diſcipline ſhould be eſtabliſhed by <hi>act of parliament,</hi> the authority of the <hi>provincial legiſlatures</hi> being deemed incompetent. And it is to be remarked, moreover, that the provincial troops were raiſed and paid by the colonies, and that it was in the power of their aſſemblies, a power exerciſed by ſome of them, to diſband or reduce them when they pleaſed, and therefore their ſupporting and keeping them up, was an effectual conſent to the act of parliament; but as hath been ſhewn, an internal tax may be as compleatly and adequately laid in every co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, by the authority of the <hi>reſpective aſſemblies,</hi> as by the <hi>Britiſh parliament,</hi> and therefore there is not the ſame neceſſity for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the mother-country in this, as in the other inſtance, and the colonies with reference to the ſtamp-act, are not called upon to do any act expreſſive of their aſſent to it, nor is it in their power to hinder its taking effect in the fulleſt exent.</p>
            <p>The act for <hi>the eſtabliſhment of a poſt-office in the colonies</hi> (9 <hi>Anne,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 10,) comes the neareſt to the ſubject of any regulation that hath been mentioned; but yet it is materially diſtinguiſhable from the ſtamp-act. For the ſame reaſon that an act of parliament was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſecure the diſcipline of the provincial troops, acting in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the <hi>Britiſh</hi> forces during the late war, the authority of parliament might be proper for the general eſtabliſhment of a regular poſt-office, for as the laws of each colony are in their operation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within the limits of each, prohibitory and compulſive clauſes to inforce a general obſervance, without which the eſtabliſhment would fail, might be eluded. If a man ſhould maliciouſly give a wound in one colony, and the wounded perſon die in another, the offender could not be convicted of murder, becauſe the whole fact conſtituting that crime, would not be cognizable in the colony where the wound was given, or the death happened; and the ſame principle is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to every other inferior offence, and intimates in what manner prohibitory clauſes might be evaded. This matter therefore of the poſt-office, may be referred to the general ſuperintending authority of the mother country, the power of the provincial legiſlatures being too ſtinted to reach it. In this view, and upon the conſideration of the general convenience and accommodation ariſing from the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the people of <hi>America,</hi> have not complained of it, but if this inſtance were more pertinent than it is, it would only prove what hath
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:009958_0039_0F7B3EF536D5A4B8"/>
been too often proved before.......when men do not ſuſpect any deſigns to invade their rights, and ſubdolous ſteps taken to that end, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of immediate convenience without pointing out their deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive tendency, they are frequently involved in ruin before they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of danger, or that the conduct flowing from the negligence of innocent intentions, may afford a handle to men of different diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, for the commiſſion of oppreſſion......of the truth of theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations the hiſtories of all people who have once been bleſſed with freedom, and have loſt it, exhibit abundant examples.</p>
            <p>When inſtances are urged as an authoritative reaſon for adopting a new meaſure, they are proved to be more important from this uſe of them, and ought therefore to be reviewed with accuracy, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſed with ſtrictneſs. What is propoſed ought to be incorporated with what hath been done, and the reſult of both ſtated and conſidered as a ſubſtantive original queſtion, and if the meaſure propoſed is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with the conſtitutional rights of the ſubject, it is ſo far from being a rational argument, that conſiſtency requires an adoption of the propoſed meaſure, that, on the contrary, it ſuggeſts the ſtrongeſt motive for aboliſhing the precedent; when therefore an inſtance of <hi>deviation</hi> from the conſtitution is preſſed as a reaſon for the <hi>eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of a meaſure ſtriking at the very root of all liberty; though the argument is inconcluſive, it ought to be uſeful.</p>
            <p>Wherefore if a ſufficient anſwer were not given to the argument drawn from precedents, by ſhewing that none of the inſtances adduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are applicable, I ſhould have very little difficulty in denying the juſtice of the principle, on which it is founded. What hath been done, if wrongful, confers no right to repeat it. To juſtify oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and outrage, by inſtances of their commiſſion, is a kind of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument which never can produce conviction, though it may <hi>their</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence, whom the terror of greater evils may reſtrain from reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thus the deſpotiſm of the eaſt may be ſupported, and the natural rights of mankind be trampled under feet. The queſtion of right, therefore, doth not depend upon precedents, but on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the conſtitution, and hath been put upon its proper point al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſcuſſed, whether the colonies are repreſented or not, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>As the name of <hi>Hambden</hi> occurred to the examiner in his deſign of caſting an oblique reflection upon the colonies, it is ſurpriſing he did not recollect, that very numerous precedents have been applied in the defence of an arbitrary and oppreſſive proceeding, deſtructive of the eſſential principle of <hi>Engliſh</hi> liberty. But though meer acts of power
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009958_0040_0F7B3EF769D20E00"/>
prove no right, yet the real opinion entertained of it, may be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from forbearance; for mankind are generally ſo fond of power, that they are oftener tempted to exerciſe it beyond the limits of juſtice, than induced to ſet bounds to it from the pure conſideration of the rectitude of forbearance. Wherefore if I had denied the principle of this kind of reaſoning, without ſhewing the defects of the artificial painted precedents which have been produced, I might ſtill very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently urge, that, the repeated and uniform requiſitions of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> miniſters, as often as occaſions for the <hi>ſingle purpoſe of revenue</hi> have happened, tranſmitted to the colonies to tax themſelves by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial acts, and the acts of parliament regulating the trade of the plantations, as well as of <hi>Ireland,</hi> without one inſtance, before the ſtamp act, of a tax impoſed by parliament upon either, for the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed</hi> purpoſe of revenue prove, that the impoſition of a tax upon them without their conſent, hath conſtantly been held to be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their conſtitutional rights and privileges. I have joined <hi>Ireland</hi> with the colonies, and preſume it will hardly be contended that <hi>Ireland,</hi> over which the courts of juſtice in <hi>England</hi> have a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendant power, is not, at leaſt, as ſubject to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> as the colonies are.</p>
            <p>A moſt extraordinary reaſon hath been given, why the method of requiſition would have been improper, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<q>the ſums raiſed muſt be paid into the exchequer, and if levied by the provincial aſſemblies, the parliament would have no right to enquire into the expenditure of them.</q>
This is ſo extremely futile, that it would be almoſt abſurd to beſtow a ſerious refutation upon it.</p>
            <p>Why muſt the ſums raiſed be paid into the exchequer? If the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is to apply them in the colonies to any internal purpoſe, why muſt they be remitted to <hi>Great-Britain?</hi> if armies are to be kept up in <hi>America,</hi> to defend the colonies againſt <hi>themſelves,</hi> (for it can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be imagined that troops are neceſſary for their protection againſt any foreign enemy) or are to be employed in the national ſervice of cropping the ears, and ſlitting the noſtrils of the civil magiſtrates, as marks of diſtinction <note n="*" place="bottom">See the narrative of the outrages committed by the ſoldiery, on Mr. juſtice <hi>Walker</hi> in <hi>Canada.</hi>
               </note>, why muſt the money be paid into the exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer? or, if it ſhould be paid into the exchequer, in order to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied towards ſinking the national debt, why might not the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enquire into the application of it? does the examiner, in his idea of the parliament, figure to himſelf a monſter with an hand that

But that which perſuaſion might not effect, and to which peculiar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances

might be adverſe, neceſſity, and an alteration of thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, may accompliſh. When the alternative is propoſed, and the one part of it aſſures ſucceſs, and a comfortable ſupport by a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate application of induſtry, familiarized by uſe, and rendered eaſy by practice; and the other affording only an experiment of precarious iſſue, calling for an application unexperienced and dreaded, attended with perplexity, and productive of irkſome anxiety, the generality of mankind would not heſitate in chooſing the former. But, though it would gain the preference of choice, yet, if the alternative is taken away, and choice yields to neceſſity, the enterprizing will form pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the judicious improve, the induſtrious execute them. Succeſs, in one inſtance, will animate the timid to make trial of the means which have ſucceeded under the direction of others, ſtimulate the phlegmatic, and rouſe the indolent—ſhould the neceſſity after a little time, ceaſe, new habits may become as ſtrong as the old, and the alternative would therefore be altered, the choice be an act of deliberation, rather than of blind impulſe; old prejudices would be greatly abated, if not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, new attachments, perhaps, be formed. From this change, different conſequences may be conjectured or foretold, and perhaps the moſt confident might be diſappointed by the event. It is not ſo difficult for men to ſtrike into new employments and methods of life, when impelled by the urgency of diſtreſs, nor ſo eaſy to call them back to their old manner of life, and divert them from new purſuits experienced to be profitable, and <hi>productive of the beſt ſecurity againſt oppreſſion,</hi> as ſome ſeem to apprehend.</p>
            <p>It is not contended that the colonies ought to be indulged in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral liberty of exporting and importing every thing in what manner they pleaſe, but, ſince they are hindered from making all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages they might do, and what advantages might they not make, if under no checks? they have a good plea againſt all rigour and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, not abſolutely neceſſary. That <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufactures come dearer, and not ſo good in quality to <hi>America,</hi> as formerly, is a very general complaint, and what effect it may have, ſhould they ſtill grow dearer and worſe in quality, or the colonies be rendered leſs able to conſume them, is a conſideration which concerns <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> at leaſt as much as the colonies. An increaſe of price, and falling in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of quality, is the uſual effect of monopolies; there is no danger of foreigners taking advantage of this circumſtance in <hi>America,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may do in other countries, but the induſtry it may give riſe to in <hi>America,</hi> when other circumſtances concur, is not difficult to be foreſeen.</p>

               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:009958_0043_0F7B3EF90F604B68"/>It muſt be acknowledged, that the balance of trade between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her colonies, is conſiderably againſt the latter, and that no gold or ſilver mines have yet been diſcovered in the old <hi>American</hi> ſettlements, or among the <hi>treaſures</hi> of the new acquiſitions. How then is this balance to be diſcharged? The former trade of the colonies, which enabled them to keep up their credit with <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the balance they had gained againſt foreigners, is now ſo fettered with difficulties, as to be almoſt prohibited. In order therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the balance againſt them upon the trade between the colonies and <hi>Great Britain,</hi> this trade muſt be contracted, ſo as to bring the ſcales to an equilibrium, or a debt will be incurred that can't be paid off, which will diſtreſs the creditor as well as the debtor, by the inſolvency of the latter. The income alſo of the colonies, which was before inveſted in their trade, will be diminiſhed in proportion to the produce of the ſtamp-act, and therefore the amount of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce muſt be drawn out, which will create a further reduction of the trade.</p>
            <p>I confeſs that I am one of thoſe who do not perceive the policy in laying difficulties and obſtructions upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>If in conſequence of the obſtructions, or regulations as they are called, of their commerce, and the impoſition of taxes upon their properties, the colonies ſhould only be driven to obſerve the ſtricteſt maxims of frugality, the conſequence would rather be diſagreeable than hurtful—ſhould they be forced to uſe new methods of induſtry, and to have recourſe to arts for a ſupply of neceſſaries, the difficulty in ſucceeding would prove leſs than the apprehenſion of miſcarrying, and the benefit greater than the hope of it. There are few people of the higheſt, and even of the middle rank, but would upon a ſtrict ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny into their ordinary diſburſements, diſcover ſome articles that would admit of defalcation.</p>
            <p>A prudent man, conſtrained to abridge his outgoings, will conſider what articles of expence may be retrenched or given up without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs or diſcomfort, and if, after this ſaving, he ſtill finds that his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences

He will reflect that the expedient which is at firſt but an indifferent ſhift, uſe and experience will improve into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, that practice will confer knowledge and ſkill, and theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility and ſatisfaction, and tho' the progreſs ſhould be ſlow and gradual, habit will grow with it, and produce reconcilement and content.</p>
            <p>What are called in <hi>North America,</hi> luxuries, ought for the moſt part to be ranked among the comforts and decencies of life, but theſe will not be relinquiſhed, if a ſupply of neceſſaries may be provided by domeſtic induſtry.......for food, thank GOD, they do not, and for raiment they need not, depend upon <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>

            <p>BY the 12th <hi>Charles</hi> II<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the colonies are reſtrained from ſending the products enumerated in the act to <hi>any foreign</hi> ports......By the 15th of the ſame king, they are prohibited from importing commodities of the growth or manufacture of <hi>Europe, except from Great-Britain,</hi> ſaving a few articles mentioned in this act.</p>
            <p>A law, which reſtrains one part of the ſociety, from <hi>exporting</hi> its products to the moſt profitable market, <hi>in favour of another</hi>; or obliges it to <hi>import</hi> the manufactures of one country that are dear, inſtead of thoſe of another that are cheap, is effectually a tax. For if the profitable <hi>exportation,</hi> and the <hi>importation</hi> of the cheaper commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were permitted, a tax equal ſuch gain in the former caſe, and to the ſaving in the latter, would leave that part of the ſociety, in the ſame ſtate and cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>on, as if under the prohibition and reſtriction above mentioned. As for inſtance in the caſe of <hi>importation.</hi>......Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a country which I will diſtinguiſh by the name of A, can pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe commodities of the ſame kind, and equal goodneſs, 20 <hi>per cent</hi> cheaper of B, than ſhe can of C;..........Then it is clear, if A is prohibited from taking theſe commodities of B, and obliged to purchaſe them of C, that A is juſt in the ſame ſtate and condition, as if ſhe were allowed to purchaſe the commodities of B, on paying thereon a duty of 20 <hi>per cent</hi> to C........This inſtance, <hi>mutatis mutan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> is equally applicable to the caſe of <hi>exportation.</hi> Hence it appears, that the country favoured by the prohibition and reſtriction, gains as much thereby, as it would do, if the proportionate tax were paid to it, upon taking off the prohibition and reſtriction; or, in other words, the profit which the one is hindered from making, in conſequence of the prohibition and reſtriction, is made by the other, in whoſe favour they have been introduced.</p>
            <p>It hath been obſerved by a well-received writer on the ſubject of trade, that
<q>a prohibition acknowledges the commodities it is laid on, to be good and cheap, otherwiſe it were needleſs, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition on the goods of any one nation, gives a monopoly to other nations, that raiſe the like.</q>
...Again....

            <p>The full clear proceeds of an hogſhead of tobacco, reckoning 952lb. in each hogſhead, has not, on an average for ſome years paſt, exceeded 4l. <note n="†" place="bottom">See before, p. 52. The attentive reader will obſerve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the net pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds of a hogſhead of tobacco, at an average, are 4l. and the taxes 3l..... together 7l.—Quere, how much per cent does the tax amount to, which takes from the two wretched tobacco colonies, 3l. out of every 7l.? And how deplorable muſt their circumſtances appear, when their vaſt debt to the mother country, and the annual burthen of their civil eſtabliſhments are added to the eſtimate? In theſe two colonies there are upwards of 180,000 taxables.</note> wherefore, on 30,000 hogſheads, the planters get 120,000l. How much of the above ſum of 831,000l. is net to the revenue, I ſhall not undertake to ſay; but I preſume it may be ſafely aſſerted, that no part of this, or any other public money, is touched by any <hi>Americans,</hi> whether <hi>they have great po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ſum of the taxes, paid in <hi>North-America,</hi> will appear enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to thoſe, who, having been told that theſe colonies pay only 7 or 800 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> in conſequence of taxes laid <hi>there,</hi> might be led, in their dependence upon <hi>miniſterial candor,</hi> to believe, that they paid no more <hi>elſewhere</hi>;......but to others, who are better acquainted with the ſubject, the computation will appear too low.—From theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations it may be inferred what vaſt wealth, in <hi>taxes only,</hi> the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther country has, in the courſe of a hundred years, drawn from her colonies; and how <hi>profoundly well-informed</hi> the writer is, who, with equal pertinency and modeſty, pronounces,

And, as great care ſhould be taken in this reſpect, ſo without doubt, it is adviſeable, that no little emulation of private intereſts of neighbour governors, nor that the petitions of <hi>hungry courtiers</hi> at home, ſhould prevail to diſcourage thoſe particular colonies, who, in a few years, have raiſed themſelves by their <hi>own charge, prudence and induſtry,</hi> to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
