            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>The</hi> Rights <hi>of</hi> Animals: An <hi>ORATION,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE deſign of my appearing in public, at this time, is to ſay a few things in favor of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain claſs of beings, whoſe rights have ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom been advocated, either from the pulpit, from the ſtage, or from the preſs. I mean the INFERIOR ANIMALS.</p>
            <p>THE cruelty, and injuſtice, with which this claſs of beings has been treated, by their boaſted ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of the human race, is too notorious to need a particular recital. In general, their welfare and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs has been looked upon as a matter of very little importance, in the ſyſtem; and in our treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, hardly to be regarded. And one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, in particular, has, by almoſt univerſal conſent, been totally excluded from any place in the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent regards of mankind: So that now, "whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever killeth them, thinketh that he doth God ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice." Yea, and many are ſo abſurd as to ſuppoſe, that this is a fulfilment of that antient prophecy, "That the ſeed of the woman ſhould bruiſe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's head."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:024242_0004_0FC57A76B6C78F40"/>
AS every ſinful indulgence, and every act of injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, ariſes from the blind and criminal ſelfiſhneſs of the human heart; to this muſt we look, as the cauſe of that unfeeling diſpoſition, together with all thoſe acts of injuſtice and cruelty, which are ſpent upon the inferior animals. It is the nature of ſelfiſhneſs, to exclude all beings but ourſelves, and thoſe whom we conſider as being related to ourſelves, from any friendly, benevolent attention. If WE are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with any pain, or are the ſubjects of any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune: or, if this be the caſe with any of thoſe, who belong to our FAMILY, or the circle of our FRIENDS, we immediately become affected by it: And always in proportion to the nearneſs of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Whereas, if any calamity befall thoſe, who are no way related to us, but who belong to a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent claſs, or circle in ſociety, our feelings are not wont to be intereſted. This will account, at once, for that diſpoſition and conduct in men, which we are now cenſuring. For the lower order of ſensible beings, are conſidered as moving in a very different ſphere, and belonging to a community of a far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature from that of ours; ſo far different, that the feelings of benevolence, are, commonly, not at all intereſted in their favor.</p>
            <p>A well known circumſtance, which attends ſome of theſe animals, contributes, not a little, to confirm us in the truth of this obſervation. For thoſe of them which are tamed, and domeſticated by us, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately become the objects of our kind regards,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024242_0005_0FC57A79F00B7040"/>and our ſenſibility is deeply wounded, when they are abuſed. But where there is no ſuch relation, by which they are diſtinguiſhed from the common her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, to uſe a phraſe denoting cruelty, they are treated LIKE BRUTES. Without the leaſt regard to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, we commonly treat them in that manner, which we ſuppoſe, will make them conduce the moſt to our own advantage; and ſubject them, in all things, to what happens to be our pleaſure. Though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, it muſt be acknowledged, that our malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence towards them, is of a diſintereſted nature, and they are tormented only for the ſake of the unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural pleaſure, which is taken in doing it.</p>
            <p>NOW, in order to determine, in what light, theſe animals ought to be conſidered, and how they ought to be treated, let us carefully attend to a few things, of known and acknowledged truth, with regard to the objects of our benevolence. And here, I think, it is paſt diſpute, that all beings, capable of happineſs belong to the number. Let their circumſtances or characters, diſpoſitions or abilities, color or ſhape, be what they may; if they are ſenſible beings, and capable of happineſs, they ought to be the objects of our benevolent regards. If the moral character of any being has become hateful, and inconſiſtent with truth and juſtice, we cannot, tis true, as ſuch, have any compl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cency in it: But, we obſerve, that the Bring itſelf, may, nevertheleſs, be as proper an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our benevolence, as any being whatever: And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024242_0006_0FC57A7AEF3870A0"/>the welfare, and real happineſs of ſuch a being, as much as we poſſibly can, conſiſtently with the rights and claims of other beings. This is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true of true benevolence. True benevolence is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, and uniform. The good man, like his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Creator, wiſhes to promote the higheſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that ſyſtem to which his influence extends: And feels devoted to PARTIES in ſociety, no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the preſent ſtate of things, and his limited capacities render it neceſſary. We may, and ought to have a true regard for all beings, according to their real worth, and to wiſh them well, according to their capacity for enjoyment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> although, in this life, we are neceſſarily limited in the execution of ſuch bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent wiſhes.

            <p>THESE obſervations, it is hoped, will help us to determine, in what light, we ought to confider the INFERIOR ANIMALS.
