            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN all the events of the world, the wiſe and good direction of God is to be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and adored. The voice of reaſon accords with the voice of revelation, in proclaiming him the diſpoſer and governor, as well as the contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and former, of the ſyſtem which we behold. The ſtupendous and minute, the beneficial and deſtructive operations and effects of natural ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, call our reverent attention to him, as their great firſt cauſe. The ſucceſſive and intereſting changes of the moral and religious, the political and ſocial aſpect of mankind, refer us to him, as their almighty and all-wiſe ſuperintendent. In
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028932_0004_0FDD70336C5B9F10"/>
ſurveying theſe occurrences, we ought to poſſeſs a firm conviction, that God has not forſaken any part of his world, nor left to chance the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any one of his creatures; that he preſides, in every place and period, to guide by his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, bleſs by his goodneſs, enliven by his ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and control by his power. In all our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on this adminiſtration of the univerſe, we ought to entertain a full perſuaſion, that he permits nothing unfit to be permitted, and effects nothing unfit to be effected; that he connects and regulates events, apparently moſt diſconnec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and irregular; and ſo over-rules and diſpoſes them, that confuſion iſſues in order, tumult in tranquillity, and ſuffering in enjoyment. By ſuch a perpetual and devout acknowledgment of the Supreme Being in all that takes place, we ſhow a becoming ſenſe of his authority, and learn his nature and perfections, the rules of his gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, and the duty and intereſt of his ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al offspring. Our hearts are impreſſed with rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence and humility, and expanded with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and joy. The murmurs of diſcontent are huſhed; the alarms of fear are quieted; the gloom, which often gathers over this diſordered ſtate, is diſperſed; and luſtre is ſhed upon the face of the world.</p>
            <p>In contemplating the wicked paſſions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of mankind, we derive conſolation and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028932_0005_0FDD7034EE3481A8"/>
from the doctrine of a wiſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent Providence. When we ſee that their heart is ſet in them to do evil, and the work of violence is in their hand, a dark veil is drawn over the divine proceedings, and men ſeem to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, that they may deform the world, and afflict each other. But theſe gloomy appearances van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and light breaks forth, when the declaration of the ſacred volume is fully conſidered and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved: SURELY THE WRATH OF MAN SHALL PRAISE GOD: THE REMAINDER OF WRATH SHALL HE RESTRAIN. The pride and ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men are ſubject to his control and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and converted to purpoſes of benevolence and wiſdom. Their diſregard and contempt of his perfections, laws, and government, and their hatred, oppreſſion, and abuſe of one another, ever have been, are, and will be ſuperintended by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, rendered ſubſervient to his glory and the general good, and limited, in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and extent, according to his appointment.</p>
            <p>This doctrine of an overruling Providence, aſſerted in the text, might be particularly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all the moral diſorders in human nature and human ſociety: but it will be more ſuitable to the occaſion to take a more confined range, and illuſtrate it with reſpect to the diſpoſition to war ever found in mankind; its ſources, operation,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028932_0006_0FDD703963B3F808"/>
and effects. We ſhudder with horror and ſigh with grief, when we conſider the ſtate of hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to which ſocieties have been incident from their formation; in conſequence of which the ſword has been the meaſure of juſtice, and the weak have been the prey of the ſtrong; man, deſigned for a bleſſing, has often proved a curſe to man, and killing and deſtroying been ſtudied as indiſpenſable arts, and purſued as glorious em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. But our feelings will not be deſtitute of relief, nor our minds of inſtruction, in the contemplation of this melancholy picture of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man depravity, folly, and miſery, if we have a ſettled belief in a preſiding Deity, and ſee a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional proſpect of the gradual reſtraint and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate termination of the violence of men.</p>
            <p>In order to furniſh this relief and inſtruction from theſe ſources, it will be attempted in the following part of this diſcourſe,</p>
            <p>I. To ſhow in what reſpect war is an evil.</p>
            <p>II. To prove, though it be in many reſpects an evil, yet that it is, under the conduct of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, in known and unknown ways, made productive of good.</p>
            <p>III. To repreſent, that as, by the influence of chriſtianity, of arts and civilization, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of war have been mitigated; ſo we have reaſon to believe, that, by the increaſe of this
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028932_0007_0FDD703E01F55BA8"/>
influence, and the progreſs of knowledge and liberty, a period will be put to contentions by force, and the world be bleſſed with univerſal and perpetual peace.</p>
            <p>Theſe topics being ſlightly diſcuſsed, an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the diſcourſe to the ſtate of our country and the preſent occaſion, will be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined.</p>
            <p>I. In what reſpects is war an evil?</p>
            <p>War is an evil in reſpect to its cauſes, effects, and extent. What are its CAUSES, but odious and diſgraceful paſſions; ungoverned ambition, avarice, pride and revenge? In ſelf-defence do a people often arm, commence and proſecute war: their motive is juſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their conduct praiſe-worthy. But as the neceſſity of ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is created by the intended or actual inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their rights; the inordinate paſſions, the unjuſt claims, the violent proceedings of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader, are ſtrictly the cauſe of every ſuch war; and in no caſe, except in that of involuntary miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, which is rare, could there be a reſort to arms by two powers, were not one diſpoſed to injure the other, and compaſs an end by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of his rights. To extend territory and commerce, and increaſe power; to keep what they have no right to poſſeſs, and gain what they have no right to purſue; to gratify reſentment, build up a faction, or eſtabliſh the tyrannical
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028932_0008_0FDD703ED90E2B58"/>
claims of family connexions; to feed a paſſion for ideal glory, or vent a turbulent and reſtleſs ſpirit; are aggreſſors in wars prompted to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the lives, and lay waſte the poſſeſſions of themſelves and their adverſaries. Actuated by theſe unjuſtifiable and unworthy views, do ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereigns and nations begin or compel thoſe, whom they inſult and oppreſs, to begin conteſts, which, maintained with blood and rapine, give a horrid and mournful aſpect to human affairs. Since perſecutions on account of religion have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten carried on with ſhocking cruelty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe deſtruction, it may be thought by ſome that religion ſhould be mentioned among the cauſes of war. But little attention is requiſite, to convince a candid mind, that it has not much conduced to this calamity; for there have been few <hi>conſcientious</hi> perſecutors;<note n="*" place="bottom">Paley's Evidences, Part iii. ch. vii.</note> the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber have acted from the luſt of gain and domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, like tyrants and conquerors in general. The wars called religious have been commonly politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and a deſire of gaining and keeping influence, not of promoting piety, has originated and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them.</p>
            <p>What mingled grief and indignation are exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our boſoms by the conſideration of theſe cauſes of war? Moſt of them paſſions, which diſgrace our nature, deſtroy our tranquility, and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028932_0009_0FDD7044B22F5210"/>
ally us to brutal and infernal beings; all of them, how inſufficient, alas! to juſtify the production of ſuch complicated and extenſive miſery! Ye princes and ſtateſmen! who, appointed by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence the protectors, become the deſtroyers of mankind, who wade to empire through blood, and water your conqueſts with the tears of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions: ye popular leaders! who employ your art and eloquence, to deceive and inflame the multitude; and to compaſs your views of faction or ambition, plunge your country into unneceſſary and deſolating war; pauſe in your mad ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, conſider the enormity of your conduct, and know, that if ſecure from the avenging arm of man, ye cannot eſcape the tribunal of Eternal Juſtice.</p>
            <p>To eſtimate its evil, from the CAUSES, we proceed to the EFFECTS of war. Lives deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which are the flower and ſtrength of a nation, and the ſoul of induſtry; cities, the ſeats of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulence and ſplendor, laid in ruins; fertile and pleaſant fields changed to dreary tracts of deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; inhabitants diverted from their uſeful employments; the channels of commerce ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed or ſtopped; the means of ſubſiſtence rendered difficult or impoſſible to be obtained; enormous public exactions; and diminiſhed or exhauſted reſources; form one aſſemblage of its calamities. See it next mingle bitterneſs in the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028932_0010_0FDD704590DDDF00"/>
cup of domeſtic joy; ſow hatred and diſſenſion in the boſom of families; diſſolve the ties, and wound the ſenſibilities of nature; rob the aged parent of his ſolace, the affectionate wife of her companion, the helpleſs child of its ſupporter. But its civil and domeſtic are outweighed by its moral evils. By the collection of men into ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the nature of military life, they are rendered diſſolute in principles and manners. By the interruption of legal proceedings, ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, being ſecure from detection and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, abounds; and by the fluctuation of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and the violation of public and private contracts attendant on war, the ſentiments and habits of juſtice are unſettled. The perpetual exerciſe of the hoſtile paſſions, creates a temper of hatred and revenge; and familiarity with ſcenes of blood, imparts a ferocious and cruel caſt to the character. Laſtly, in conſequence of this ſtate of diſunion and hoſtility in which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions exiſt, the rights of all, except the ſtrongeſt, are inſecure; poſſeſſions are unſtable, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is damped by an ever wakeful jealouſy. Peace, not ſuperſeding a conſtant readineſs for war, is ſcarce leſs expenſive than war itſelf; the vindication of rights often cauſes more loſs than their ſurrender; entering into treaties is almoſt uſeleſs, whilſt there is no ſecurity for their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance; avoiding contentions of our own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028932_0011_0FDD7046E0EEADE8"/>
not tranquillity, whilſt we are expoſed to the frequent neceſſity of taking part in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of others. The energy of nations is expended in the defence, rather than the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of their poſſeſſions; and the bleſſings beſtowed on them by God and nature are unuſed or waſted.</p>
            <p>The EXTENT of war is as great, as its CAUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ES and EFFECTS are deſtructive. In what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod has it not ſounded its alarms? In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion has it not ſpread its deſolations? From the firſt age to the preſent, from the northern to the ſouthern zone, from the rude pagan of America to the poliſhed chriſtian of Europe, the reſort to force has prevailed. At this moment we behold the greateſt portion of the civilized world in hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile commotion, and the ancient continent a field of battle.</p>
            <p>Such is the picture of diſtreſs and ruin, which war in general preſents. Is the mind oppreſſed with gloom and horror on beholding it? Let it be cheered and inſtructed by conſidering, what is the ſecond topic of diſcourſe,</p>
            <p>II. That though war be in many reſpects an evil, yet it is, under the conduct of divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, in known and unknown ways, made productive of good.</p>
            <p>God's ſuperintendence over human affairs is declared in the ſcriptures in various and pointed
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028932_0012_0FDD704E2C5AB0C8"/>
terms. "Of him, through him, and to him, are all things. Shall there be evil in the city and the Lord hath not done it? Who ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whom ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he will; putteth down one and ſetteth up another; maketh peace and createth evil;" who ſaith to the wrathful tyrant, "I will put my hook in thy noſe, and my bridle in thy lips; for this cauſe have I raiſed thee up, to ſhow in thee my power." Let not out inability to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the manner, induce us to doubt the reality of this divine adminiſtration. Who will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to deny that the Almighty Lord of the univerſe is both able and diſpoſed to exerciſe it? He is able, becauſe he poſſeſſes univerſal knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, perfect wiſdom, and infinite power. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with theſe perfections, he may, by ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally eſtabliſhing ſuch laws in the natural and moral world, as would produce the preciſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and no other, which he chooſes to have occur, or by occaſional interpoſitions, regulate all events. Is it objected that the freedom of the human will proves the events depending on that will incapable of regulation? We reply that this faculty is the gift of God, to whom, when he beſtowed it, all its poſſible operations were known; therefore it operates nothing which he did not determine to admit into his world. Beſides, how entirely may be control its determinations,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028932_0013_0FDD704F2DFE8D28"/> without deſtroying its freedom. If a wiſe man, by addreſing motives to the mind of a perſon, can in many inſtances preciſely influence his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, without infringing his agency; we muſt aſcribe a ſimilar power in far higher meaſure to God, the being, whoſe underſtanding is infinite, and whoſe preſence is univerſal; who has acceſs to the moſt delicate ſprings and latent move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our ſouls; and holds all nature in his hand, from a planet to an atom, from a ſyſtem to a worm. To prove that he is diſpoſed, as well as able, to conduct the affairs of his world, if it be not irreverent to talk of proving ſo bright a truth, we need only obſerve, that God made the world for ſome end; and unleſs he control occurrences, this end may be fruſtrated; and that he is good, delighting in the happineſs of his creatures; therefore does not reſign them to chance, nor bind them in fate; but limits and guides actions and events, as the purpoſes of goodneſs dictate.</p>
            <p>Aſſured, therefore, that the commencement, the continuance, and the termination of war, the moſt unjuſt and cruel, is in all caſes under the conduct of divine Providence; we are alſo aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that evil as it is, in unknown as well as known ways, it is made productive of good. By abſtract reaſonings, on the character of God, by the prevailing tendency of his works, and by
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028932_0014_0FDD70554739CEC8"/>
the diſcoveries of revelation, we are compelled to believe that the Author of the univerſe is good, as well as powerful and wiſe. Therefore, ſeeing he is a perfect being, a perfect ſyſtem will be produced by him; and no events be directed or permitted to take place in it, which are not conſiſtent with the greateſt good of the whole. Though we diſcern not how natural and moral evil is rendered ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to good; yet we ought not to doubt it; nor deny that that is the beſt of all poſſible ſyſtems, in which much evil is mingled; whilſt we ſee it evidently anſwering important ends, eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to a ſtate of moral diſcipline, giving ſcope to great and improving exertion, and often iſſuing in enjoyment. This reaſoning on evil in general, muſt be applied to the evil of war in particular. When ready to inquire, why war has been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to rage in every period, clime and nation, why the weak and inoffenſive have been ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the injuſtice and violence of the powerful and ambitious, and have been forced to ſeek ref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uge from the calamities of oppreſſion in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of reſiſtance; let us reflect on that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine adminiſtration, which in numberleſs undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible methods, brings order and happineſs out of this diſorder and miſery; let us reflect on that human ignorance, which forbids cenſure, complaint, or diſtruſt; and let our reliance on this almighty and benevolent ſuperintendence be
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028932_0015_0FDD7055B3E04DD0"/>
ſtrengthened by conſidering ſome inſtances, in which good is made to reſult from war, howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unjuſtifiable may be its authors, or deſtructive its general and direct effects.</p>
            <p>In ſacred hiſtory, we behold the violence and hoſtility of man, from the firſt unnatural mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the crucifixion of the Saviour inſtument<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of important purpoſes, by diſplaying the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perfections; by rewarding the good, pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing the bad and reclaiming the devious; by aiding and accompliſhing the diſpenſations of heaven for the inſtruction and ſalvation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>Viewing ſociety in the glaſs of general hiſtory, we find this deſtroying ſcourge in ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects a bleſſing to man, as it relates to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his character and condition, to lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty and ſcience.</p>
            <p>It rouſes men in the ſavage ſtate from their ſtupidity. Their intellect buried under the groſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of appetite, and their powers exerted only at the calls of ſenſe, they naturally ſink into brutal ſelf-indulgence, and liſtleſs inaction. The deſire of a better ſtate, it is obſerved, has leſs influence in exciting human efforts than the fear of a worſe. Therefore, impending danger, aided by ſtrong deſires of revenge and glory, kindles the ardor, and ſtimulates the activity of barbarians, when nothing elſe would do it. They
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028932_0016_0FDD7056BB58A850"/>
are thus preſerved from the degradation of a mere animal life; their faculties are invigorated by exerciſe; for purpoſes of offence and defence they invent and employ arts, from which, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and advanced, peace derives its conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ience, and life its moſt valuable improvements.<note n="*" place="bottom">Prieſtley's lectures on hiſtory.</note>
            </p>
            <p>War calls forth ſome of the nobleſt and beſt energies of the ſoul, for which the calm of peace does not afford ſuch favorable opportunities. The magnanimity, which contemns difficulty, the courage which defies danger, the humanity which relents over a vanquiſhed foe, the ingenuity which deviſes and the vigor which executes, are brought into illuſtrious diſplay in military con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts; and ſpread a glory over the character of the warrior.</p>
            <p>To the violent attempts of tyrants to retard and cruſh liberty, are we to aſcribe in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances its rapid progreſs and complete trtumph. The cruel oppreſſion or wanton deſtruction of one or more aſſerters of it has, by intereſting pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic compaſſion in their favor, increaſed the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents of their cauſe; and by rouſing the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral indignation, inſpirited the united reſiſtance of the ſufferers, and effected the ſudden over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of uſurpation and deſpotiſm.</p>
            <p>Truth, eſpecially religious truth, muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to have been in ſome meaſure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028932_0017_0FDD705C25404CF8"/>
by the violence of its enemies. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relenting perſecution of the firſt teachers of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, by warming their zeal and animating their exertions; by putting it in their power to give convincing proof of their ſincerity by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary patience and reſolution; and by awaking ſympathy with them as injured perſons, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted indirectly to extend and eſtabliſh the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</p>
            <p>What conſolation have we amid the horror and execration of war, and what gratitude and truſt are due to the Supreme Diſpoſer, when we conſider ſome of the advantages flowing to ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and art from this unexpected ſource. Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſhows that public commotions, by obliging men of learning to retreat from the ſeat of war in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to quiet countries, have brought to them valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acceſſions of knowledge; that barbarous nations conquered by civilized, have received arts with maſters; that by conqueſt a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has been opened between regions before ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arated from each other; and the empire of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and refinement been greatly enlarged. But in another view it has been obſerved to ſerve the cauſe of human improvement. A military con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, particularly of a free people in defence of freedom, creates a ferment of mind, ſets the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to work, expands the views, and invigorates the active principles. Hence in a time of public
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028932_0018_0FDD705E450D51D8"/>
commotion, ingenious and important diſcoveries and inventions often appear; and ſoon after the cloſe of a ſucceſsful ſtruggle for their liberties by a nation, rapid progreſs is made in the arts and ſciences. Our country exemplifies the truth of this obſervation, which amid the tumult of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution eſtabaliſhed academies of ſciences, and made great advances in ſpeculative and practical knowledge; and which, ſince the return of peace, has exhibited ſingular exertions of genius and enterpriſe, accompliſhed in a few years what the boldneſs of conjecture had not preſumed to date within half a century; and by that force of character which overcame our invaders, is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming nature.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the known ways, in which war, however evil in its cauſes and effects, has been obſerved, under the conduct of divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, to be productive of good. What ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, gratitude, and joy ſhould be raiſed in our hearts by the conſideration of this Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which makes the contentions, which we lament, the means of our improvement, and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces important bleſſings from dreadful calamities. Yet, notwithſtanding theſe conſoling circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attendant on war, its ruin and diſtreſs are ſo extenſive and mournful, as to make the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent exult in the idea—</p>

III. That as by the influence of chriſtianity, and the advancement of arts and civilization, the horrors of war have been mitigated among many nations, ſo we have reaſon to believe, that by the increaſe of this influence, and the progreſs of knowledge and liberty, a period will be put to contentions by force, and the world be bleſſed with univerſal and perpetual peace.</p>
            <p>In thoſe nations, who have received the NAME of CHRISTIAN, though national diſputes are decided by force; yet this is done with leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency, cruelty, and deſtruction, than marked ſuch deciſions among ancient and heathen States. The mild and gentle tenets of the goſpel, and the view it gives of the perfect equality of man, as partakers of a common nature, duty, and hope, and children of a common parent, have had a mighty effect, notwithſtanding the great and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral perverſion of its doctrines, and diſregard of its precepts, to ſoften the animoſities, remove the prejudices, and promote the union of public bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies. The abolition of polytheiſm and human ſacrifices, of domeſtic slavery, the expoſure of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and other ſhocking vices practiſed and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated in the moſt refined ages of the moſt refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nations of antiquity, the diffuſion of a ſpirit of mildneſs and charity into the intercourſe of private life, and the introduction of humane maxims into war, the obſervance of which ſtrips
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028932_0020_0FDD7064FA5F8AE0"/>
it of half its torrors, are among the effects of the chriſtian religion. To this ſource they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably traced, becauſe they naturally flowed from it; they exiſted with it; and they are not found, where it has not reached. This religion was not without its influence even on the barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous invaders of the Roman empire, after their ſettlement in it. It laid ſome reſtraint on the ferocity of private quarrels in the dark ages; and it mingled its gentleneſs and humanity, with barbarian fierceneſs and cruelty, in chivalry. So much reſpect to its principles do the preſent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſtendom render, as to acknowledge the unlawfulneſs of offenſive war, by prefacing their declarations of hoſtilities with arguments to ſhow, that they are not the aggreſſors.<note n="*" place="bottom">Winthrop's Syſtematic Arrangement of Prophecies.</note> In bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle all are commonly ſpared who ceaſe to reſiſt. Captives are not led in oſtentatious triumph, reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſlavery, or ſlain on the altars of ſuperſtition. The inhabitants of conquered countries are not tranſplanted from their native ſoil; but allowed their poſſeſſions, laws, and religion. If civil wars have not been equally diveſted of their cruelty and horror as foreign wars, th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> aſpect is ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if the preſent conteſt in Europe has a character of ferocity; it ſhould be remembered that it is a peculiar conteſt; it is a ſtruggle for exiſtence; it is the collected energy of deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028932_0021_0FDD706694CE9D48"/>
combating the deſperate enthuſiaſm of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty.</p>
            <p>The advancement of ARTS has concurred with the principles of our benign religion in leſſening the evils of war, by opening another field for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe than the performance of martial exploits, ſoftening the character, and creating in men ſuch an incapacity for war or averſion to it, that the number deſtined to arms in modern, bears no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to that of ancient times.</p>
            <p>We ought to acknowledge with gratitude the benefits of the deſtructive invention of GUNPOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER. In conſequence of its uſe in fighting, it has been obſerved, war is changed from a matter of ſtrength to a matter of calculation; nations are placed more upon a level; the frequency of appeals to arms is diminiſhed; and the mode of fighting is ſo altered, and the combatants are ſo ſecured by diſtance and fortifications, that fewer lives are deſtroyed in a modern war of years, than fell in former ages in a ſingle battle.</p>
            <p>By ſuch methods, and in ſuch meaſure, have the horrors of war been mitigated among a large portion of mankind. Is it an illuſion to believe, that by the increaſe of the influence of the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion, and by the progreſs of knowledge and liberty, a period will be put to contentions by force, and the world be bleſſed with univerſal and perpetual peace?</p>
            <p>

By a compariſon of the paſt with the preſent, it appears probable that human affairs are grad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually advancing to perfection. Though they have ſeemed to revolve, alternately aſcending to a certain point of elevation; and returning to a correſpondent point of depreſſion; and it may be ſuppoſed will continue revolving in this manner to the end of time; yet evident is it, that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of every total revolution has been a better State than exiſted before it; that the ſecond point of elevation has been higher than the firſt; the third, than the ſecond. The Grecian glory was brighter than the Perſian; the Roman, brighter than the Grecian; and the glory of this age exceeds that of the brigheſt preceding. In learning and arts, in government and religion, in perſonal liberty and ſecurity, in convenience and agreeableneſs of living, and in mildneſs and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of manners, in all that exalts and bleſſes ſociety, our ſuperiority to the greateſt and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt nations of antiquity is ſtriking and inconteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. None can deny the greater humanity diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in the conduct of modern wars. As wiſe and benevolent principles have prevailed to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate, why may they not further prevail to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate our hoſtilities? As one ſtep has been tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from the ſtate of nature by the ſocial ſtate of individuals, why may not another ſtep be taken by the ſocial State of nations? It is agreed that
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028932_0023_0FDD706BF086C290"/>
it would promote their true intereſt to ſubſtitute arbitration for the appeal to arms, when diſputes are to be decided; to cultivate each his own ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itory, maintain commerce free, and direct their energy to the arts of peace. It may be thought that they will not apprehend or purſue this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt hereafter, becauſe they have not apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or purſued it heretofore. Why have they not always diſcerned and ſought it? Becauſe kings, and the minions of kings, the moſt ignorant and profligate of their ſpecies, have managed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerns of civilized ſtates, who, ſtrangers to the maxims of ſound policy and equity, influenced by contracted views, weak thirſt for dominion, or miſtaken honor, have refuſed to concur in any pacific ſyſtem; becauſe the people, ſhrouded, in ignorance, and chained in ſervitude, have neither known nor aſſerted their rights, and could be controled by deſpots and deluded by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magogues.</p>
            <p>But a new era is commencing in human af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and new features are forming in the human character. Light is pouring in upon a benight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world, and the ſhades of error and ignorance are beginning to retire before it. The Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can revolution has taken the film from the eyes of nations; and enabled them to read the eternal truths, inſcribed by God on the heart of every human being; which declare, that men have
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028932_0024_0FDD706D26B7A2E8"/>
equal rights, and that government is formed ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſecure them. With this progreſs of KNOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEDGE will be joined the equal progreſs of her inſeparable companion, LIBERTY. It is eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in our country, it is, we truſt, beginning to be eſtabliſhed in more than one country in Europe. Whilſt the contention of the greateſt nation of the old world for this invaluable bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is marked by all the atrocities and diſorders, which can be expect to enſue, from the intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of freedom, the removal of accuſtomed reſtraints, and the reſentment and deſpair excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a wanton and combined invaſion of the enemies of their cauſe among a numerous people, hardened by oppreſſion, untaught in firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and debaſed and corrupted by the foul vices of atheiſm and ſuperſtition; whilſt it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced by outrages, at which reaſon and religion weep, and humanity recoils, it is maintained with an undaunted reſolution, and a reſiſtleſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy, which encourage the hope of its happy iſſue in the eſtabliſhment of a free government. This ſpirit will probably run on and kindle the flames of reſiſtance in every country enſlaved, and and introduce a new order of things. If the civil and eccleſiaſtical oppreſſors of the earth, alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſpreading contagion, add double weight to the chains of their ſubjects, their intemperate tyranny will ſerve only to force a quicker con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028932_0025_0FDD707267DE0630"/>
of injury into the hearts of the oppreſſed; and haſten the time, and aggravate the horrors of their fall. In this way, a way beſet with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, extravagances, and ſorrows, will liberty, the ſoul of improvement, the ſupport of virtue, and the bleſſing of exiſtence, finally triumph through the world.</p>
            <p>If nations become enlightened and free, they will, at the ſame time, become ſolicitous to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve mutual peace; becauſe they will ſee peace to be their intereſt, and their intereſt they will mainly purſue. Though well informed repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans may, by the influence of powerful men, the eloquence of incendiaries, the intrigues of the factious, and ſudden paſſion, be drawn into ſome erroneous meaſures; yet the maxims of ſound policy will guide their general counſels. Man tends to his own happineſs as bodies tend to their centre. His miſtake of the means, not his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern about the end, occaſions his not obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. By experience he diſcovers theſe means; and when this unerring inſtructer ſhall teach free and independent nations, that they loſe wealth, population, glory, and happineſs by a ſtate of hoſtility, will they not mutually cultivate peace? Will they not decline contentions by force, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in caſes of imperious neceſſity; and reſpect the rights, that they may enjoy the friendſhip of each other?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:028932_0026_0FDD7074C57DA7A8"/>
The hope inſpired by theſe conſiderations is raiſed to aſſurance by the evidence furniſhed by reaſon and the ſacred predictions, that chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will be finally embraced by all mankind. Thoſe whoſe faith and expectation reſt on this ſyſtem, as on the rock of ages, cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, triumphant as unbelief may be, that it will fail of its juſt influence over mankind in due time. They ſee in its grand diſcoveries, benign ſpirit, pure precepts, and noble intention, all that is conducive to the conſolation and improvement of individuals, the order and happineſs of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and they cheriſh the pleaſing belief, that ſooner or later its charms will be diſplayed to mankind in that juſt and impreſive view, which will engage their admiration and love. Does the paſt inefficacy foretel the future rejection of this divine ſyſtem? By no means: for men have been hitherto from various cauſes more incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and more indiſpoſed to receive it, than we truſt they will be in future. In almoſt every country, it has been made an engine of tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal power, and a ſupport of civil abuſes. It has been concealed under the rubbiſh, which barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ages have heaped upon it. It has been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented by the intereſted or abſurd conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and diſhonored by the looſe, the unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and worldly practices of its teachers. And men have beheld in chriſtianity not the majeſtic
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028932_0027_0FDD7079EE837880"/>
and beautiful ſtructure raiſed by Chriſt and his apoſtles; but a misſhapen and deformed edifice of human contrivance. It being repreſented in this falſe and diſtorted view, by men not daring through fear, or not deſiring through intereſt, or not capacitated through ignorance and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to repreſent it in a more juſt and fair one, men of free minds, beholding it only in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, have been unable to reſpect, have been compelled to contemn it. When ſtripped of every human appendage, it ſhall ſtand forth in its genuine form; when, by the diffuſion of light ſuperſtition and bigotry ſhall wear away; and by the experience of their enormous evils, irreligion and ſcepticiſm ſhall appear as they are, the poiſon of human peace and happineſs; men will be prompted to ſeek a retreat from the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of doubt, and the tempeſts of paſſion, in this light and ſerene temple of God.</p>
            <p>But the immoveable foundation of our faith, in the final and complete ſucceſs of the chriſtian religion, is laid in thoſe predictions of the ſacred writings, the accompliſhment of a part of which is a pledge of the completion of the whole. Theſe point our enraptured view to a time, when "Jeſus Chriſt ſhall have the heathen for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion. The knowledge of God ſhall cover the earth, as the waters fill the ſeas: The
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028932_0028_0FDD707ACC179C90"/>
ſaints of the Moſt High ſhall take the kingdom; and the greatneſs of the kingdom under the whole heaven ſhall be given to the people of the ſaints of the Moſt High. The people ſhall be all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and not hurt nor deſtroy. Nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt nation; but they ſhall beat their ſwords into plough ſhares and their ſpears into pruning hooks, and learn war no more:" Thus the univerſal prevalence of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian principles will ſecure and perpetuate univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal peace. Among nations, warmed by that charity, which ſeeketh not her own, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces all men as brethren; and guided by that equity, which renders to all their dues; diſputes as injuries will be rare; and when they ariſe, will be peaceably adjuſted by acknowledged principles or a common tribunal. The efforts, now expended in the defence, will be employed in the improvement of countries; and the gifts of nature, now unuſed or deſtroyed, will be made to yield all their reſources to public and private happineſs. In the intercourſe of independent communities, harmony will take place of diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, beneficence of unkindneſs, ſincerity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and unſuſpicious ſecurity of jealous fear.</p>
            <p>We have now finiſhed the diſcuſion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed topics of this diſcourſe; and have endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured to ſhow, that great and unqueſtionable an evil as war is, it is ever ſuperintended by a wiſe
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028932_0029_0FDD7080AE2B88C8"/>
and benevolent Providence, and made produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of good in ſeveral important inſtances; that its horrors have been mitigated by the mildneſs of the chriſtian ſpirit and the advancement of arts; and we have reaſon to believe, that by the increaſed and extended influence of this ſpirit and the progreſs of light and freedom, the practice of deciding natural diſputes by force will be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and univerſal and perpetual peace bleſs the world.</p>
            <p>A few reflections ariſing from the ſubject, and adapted to the ſtate of our country and the preſent occaſion, will be added.</p>
            <p>Vice, we have ſeen, is rendered in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects productive of good; but let it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be leſs deteſted. It is odious in its nature, and deſtructive in its direct conſequences; and if ſuffered to take its unreſtrained courſe, would ſpread ruin and diſorder through the world. When the irreligious are made without intention to promote religion, the tyrannical freedom, and the cruel humanity, let us abhor the inſtruments, whilſt we approve the ends, and lament the cauſes, whilſt we rejoice in the effects. Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and tempeſts excite grief and terror, though they fertilize the earth, or purify the air.</p>
            <p>Are we aſſured that all events are ſubject to the wiſe and good direction of God; that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial evil is general good; and that ambition,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028932_0030_0FDD70818AB2A1D8"/>
pride, revenge, and impiety are made in unnum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered ways to iſſue in advantage to the ſyſtem of rational and ſenſitive being; huſhed be our complaints, compoſed be our fears. "The Lord reigneth; let the earth rejoice. Though clouds and darkneſs are round about him, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs and judgment are the foundation of his throne."</p>
            <p>What emotions of pious gratitude and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonder ſhould we feel, when we conſider that peace has been the general lot of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; that from the favourable character and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, of the American people, our revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was unattended by that deſolation and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, convulſion and diſtreſs, which mark that of a great European nation; that we are flowing in the wealth and proſperity of peace and neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality, whilſt the old world is ſuffering the havoc and devaſtation of as extenſive, as furious, and as calamitous a war, as ever afflicted and diſgraced mankind; and laſtly, that the genius of our government, the good ſenſe and virtue of our citizens, and the remoteneſs of our ſituation from the cabals of Europe, afford us the faireſt proſpect of the continued and perpertual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of peace, which ever ſhone on any nation of the earth.</p>
            <p>But ſuch is the verſatility of human affairs, ſuch the violence of human paſſions, and ſuch
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028932_0031_0FDD7082E5CEE0F8"/>
the diſordered ſtate of the world in general, that none could be ſurpriſed, were this proſpect ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly obſcured. The clouds have ſcarce diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, which lately darkened our political ſky; God only knows how ſoon they may again collect and thicken to a tempeſt. Every poſſible motive urges our government to foſter, and our citizens to cultivate the military art. Whatever hope we may entertain of the future prevalence of pacific principles among nations, we know that this age will not enjoy its completion; that ſtrength is now the only ſafe guard of right; and that to be obliged to fight for our liberties and laws, or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render them, is no improbable alternative in this period of convulſion. It becomes us to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſhow ourſelves not unworthy of theſe bleſſings, by our ſkill and valor in their defence. Should the unhallowed hand of foreign or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic violence attempt to wreſt them from us, to be ready to protect them with our lives and fortunes, is a duty we owe to heaven and to earth; to the cauſe of liberty in all countries, which looks to us for direction and encouragement; to our fathers, who beſtowed, and to our child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren who will receive the fair inheritance, whoſe execrations we ſhall richly merit, if it be not tranſmitted to them undiminiſhed; to the ſages and heroes, who paid the price of our freedom with their counſels, labors, wounds, and death;
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028932_0032_0FDD7089AD616E80"/>
to that God, who fought our battles and ordained our triumph, who hath ſet us on an eminence, a "leſſon to the oppreſſor, or, an example to the oppreſſed," a ſublime and inſtructive ſpectacle to the world.</p>
            <p>To the Gentlemen, who compoſe the Ancient and Honorable Company, whoſe anniverſary Election gives brilliancy to this day, theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations need not an elaborate diſplay. The paſt utility and reſpectability of their inſtitution; the attention paid them by the Supreme Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive of the commonwealth; and the military, civil, and moral worth of character, which they poſſeſs, are ſo many pledges to their country, that they will purſue, with ſteadineſs and vigor, the objects of their aſſociation, and will continue it a nurſery of martial ſkill and ſpirit.</p>
            <p>May we all remember that we are engaged in a warfare, in which the contention is not for an earthly republic, that will paſs away, but for a heavenly kingdom, that will endure forever. Death will ſoon releaſe us from the ſervice; and introduce us to our Divine Commander, whoſe plaudit or cenſure we ſhall then receive. Where are the thouſands, who in a long ſucceſſion of years, have joined in the devotion of this houſe on the preſent anniverſary, and rejoiced like us on the cheerful occaſion. They have fallen by the ſtroke of the great deſtroyer, and lie mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028932_0033_0FDD708B23A51770"/>
duſt, in the dark chambers of the caverned earth. Happy they, who amid powerful ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, have maintained with reſolution the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian warfare, and ſecured the conqueſt. The voice of the arch angel and the trump of God will wake to life the ſlumbering atoms; and the Captain of their ſalvation will adorn their vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious brows with the garland of immortality.</p>
