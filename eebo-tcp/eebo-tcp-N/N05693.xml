            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>On Wedneſday the 26th of <hi>June,</hi> in the Forenoon, the Governor came to an Anchor in the Harbour at <hi>Falmouth,</hi> where he found the Province Sloop and Tranſports had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd the Day before, and the Forces encamp'd on <hi>Bang</hi>'s Iſland; that the Honorable <hi>Daniel Warner, Peter Gilman</hi> and <hi>Clement March,</hi>

From the inſolent Behaviour of the <hi>Norridgwalk</hi> Indians in general towards the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Kennebeck</hi> River, and at <hi>Richmond</hi> Fort, it was apprehended for ſome Weeks before the Interview, that they were upon the point of breaking out into open Hoſtilities; ſo that their Arrival at <hi>Falmouth</hi> to meet his Excellency was contrary to Expectation, and ſeems owing to the Accident of their Prielt's having left them 20 Days before, to go to <hi>Canada,</hi> againſt the Advice of the Jeſuit of the <hi>Penobſcots,</hi> and the miſ-carriage of that Jeſuit's Letter before-mention'd to him.</p>
            <p>Beſides the before-mention'd Information given to the Governor by Capt. <hi>Lithgow</hi> concerning the Refuſal of the <hi>Arſſeguntacook</hi> Indians to be preſent at the Interview (which in his Excellency's Conference ſoon after with the <hi>Norridgwalk</hi> Indians was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by them,) Governor <hi>Wentworth</hi> had acquainted him a few Weeks before he ſet out for <hi>Falmouth,</hi> that ſome of thoſe Indians had then lately carried off a whole Family Captive, and plunder'd two Houſes within the Province of <hi>New Hampſhire;</hi> ſo that there was no Foundation to expect that they would ſend any of their Tribe to the Treaty.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Penobſcot</hi> Indians, with whom it appears from their Jeſuit's Letter to the Jeſuit of the <hi>Norridgwalks,</hi> as well as from their own to the Governor, how active and ſucceſsful that Prieſt had been in perſwading them not to meet his Excellency at <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> but to inſiſt upon his coming to treat with them at <hi>St. George</hi>'s River; tho' there ſeem'd very little, if any, grounds to expect, <hi>they</hi> would be induced to come to <hi>Falmouth;</hi> yet as it had been determined in Council before his Excellency left <hi>Boſton,</hi> that it would be below the Dignity of his Majeſty's Governor, and the Honour of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, for his Excellency to ſubmit, in caſe of that Tribe's peremptory Refuſal to meet him at <hi>Falmouth,</hi> which Place he had appointed for the Interview, to go to them at <hi>St. George</hi>'s; and at the ſame Time his Excellency look'd upon it to be a Point of conſiderable Conſequence for facilitating the ſeveral Parts of the Service, he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in upon <hi>Kennebeck</hi> River, to have a friendly Conference with them at this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture; he determined to uſe his utmoſt Efforts to bring them to meet him at <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and accordingly forthwith diſpatch'd a Sloop to <hi>St. George</hi>'s for that Purpoſe, with his Orders to Capt. <hi>Bradbury,</hi> contain'd in the following Letter;</p>

                  <p>I Would have you let the Chiefs of the <hi>Penobſcot</hi> Indians know, that in compliance with their and the <hi>Norridgwalk</hi> Tribe's repeated Requeſt in their Letter dated from <hi>Richmond</hi> the laſt Winter; wherein they preſs'd me to come early this Summer in Perſon to treat with them upon the Matters therein mention'd, I am come to this Place, as ſoon as the public Affairs of the Province, and <hi>their</hi> Hunting Seaſon would permit me, to meet them; and tell them, that I bring with me a ſincere Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to renew and ſtrengthen the antient Friendſhip, which hath from Time to Time ſubſiſted between this Government and their Tribe.</p>
                  <p>I would likewiſe have you let them know, that I have thought very much upon what they wrote to me in their laſt Letter from St. <hi>George's,</hi> concerning their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I would come thither to treat with them, and that River's being the uſual Place of Conference between the Governors of this Province, and their Tribe; and you muſt tell them from me, that they are greatly miſtaken in that Matter: Neither Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor <hi>Shutt,</hi> nor Governor <hi>Dummer,</hi> nor Governor <hi>Belcher</hi> ever met them at St. <hi>George</hi>'s; they (the Indians) came from St. <hi>George</hi>'s to <hi>Arrowſick</hi> Iſland in 1717, to meet the firſt of thoſe Governors, and always either to <hi>Boſton</hi> or <hi>Falmouth</hi> to treat with the other two: It is true that I appointed my firſt Interview and Conference with them in 1742, to be held at St. <hi>George</hi>'s; but the Reaſon of my chooſing that Place then, was, becauſe I was deſirous of viſiting the moſt remote Settlements in that Part of the Province, at my firſt taking the Adminiſtration of the Government upon me; and if I <hi>had</hi> come to St. <hi>George</hi>'s at that Time upon <hi>their Requeſt,</hi> yet even that would be a ſtrong Reaſon why they ſhould now come to meet me at <hi>Falmouth;</hi> where Col. <hi>Maſcarene</hi> hath accompany'd me, as a Commiſſioner from the Government of <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> and three Commiſſioners from the Government of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> to have an Interview likewiſe with them, on the Part of thoſe Provinces.</p>

                     <pb n="7" facs="unknown:007222_0006_102B3FC702F90068"/>
Upon the whole, I would have you acquaint them, that <hi>I ſully expeil</hi> them to come to me to this Place; that I have ſent a Sloop to bring them thither, and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours for them to make uſe of upon this Occaſion; and order'd you to attend and conduct them; that if they perſiſt in their Refuſal to do it, after I am come ſo far to brighten the Covenant Chain with them, and ſo early in the Year to gratify them; I ſhall look upon it as a great Affront to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Governments, and a ſure Mark that they are indifferent whether they preſerve our antient Amity and Kindneſs for them or not.</p>
                  <p>I particularly obſerve, what they write to me at the End of their Letter; in which they ſay, "That they write in behalf of the <hi>Norridgwalks,</hi> as well as themſelves." This muſt be

                  <p>Upon this Occaſion I would have you remind them of their Prieſt's Letter to me, which I communicated to them the laſt Summer; in which he endeavour'd to diſwade me from ſending Commiſſioners the laſt Year, to diſtribute the Preſents from this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to them; and of the Proofs I then ſent them of his Artifices to raiſe Jealouſies among them, in order to break off our Friendſhip: And I would have you aſſure them, that I have lately receiv'd undoubted Proofs of the ſame Prieſt's acting at this Time the like treacherous Part to them, and uſing his utmoſt Endeavours to engage them in Acts of Hoſtility againſt us.</p>
                  <p>And I would have you further tell them, That if this Government had not a great Regard for them, and a real Deſire to continue their antient Friendſhip and Kindneſs to them, I ſhould not have been ſo earneſt in my Endeavours to perpetuate Peace and Amity between us; but the Succeſs of that muſt depend upon their Meeting me here; and their Refuſal to do it will be look'd upon by me, as an high Affront and a full Proof that they are determin'd to break off Friendſhip, with us.</p>

            <p>At the ſame Time; as the <hi>Norridgwalk</hi> Indians were the original Proprietors of the Lands upon <hi>Kennebeck</hi> River, and the only Indians now intereſted in them, and there was Reaſon to expect that the Preſence of the <hi>Penobſcots,</hi> who would probably come fully inſtincted by their Prieſt to uſe their utmoſt Influence over the <hi>Norridgwalks</hi> in oppoſition to the intended March to the Head of <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> &amp;c. the erecting a Fort higher up the River than <hi>Richmond,</hi> and making further the Settlements upon it, would embarraſs the Conference with the <hi>Norridgwalks</hi> upon thoſe Points; the Governor determin'd with the Advice of His Majeſty's Council, to have a ſeperate Conference with the laſt mention'd Indians, and diſpatch them away from <hi>Falmouth</hi> (if poſſible) before the Arrival of the <hi>Penobſcots</hi> there.</p>
            <p>The Delay likewiſe, which the Governor's ſtaying for the Arrival of the <hi>Penobſcots,</hi> before he treated with the <hi>Norridgwalk</hi> Indians, would have occaſion'd to the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Troops, whoſe Preſence at <hi>Caſco,</hi> during the Conference with thoſe Indians, it was apprehended would contribute to make them acquieſce in the March of the Forces thro' their Country, building the intended Forts up the River <hi>Kennebeck</hi> above <hi>Richmond,</hi> and making other Settlements upon it, was another Motive for hastening on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with that Tribe.</p>
            <p>Accordingly his Excellency receiv'd a Viſit from the <hi>Norridgwalks</hi> the ſame Day at his Lodgings; and appointed the Day following, being Friday the 28th of <hi>June</hi> to ſpeak with them in publick.</p>

                     <p>YOU have a long Time wanted that which is good, viz. <hi>Peace:</hi> We alſo want that which is good; and we want to ſee you the next Spring; and when we hear each other talk, we will both endeavour to do that, which is right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us.</p>

               <p>'You have well ſpoken, <hi>Brethren,</hi> in what you have ſaid; and I am now come to talk with you upon it; and to do what is neceſſary for ſettling our Peace upon a laſting Foundation.</p>
               <p>'The <hi>French</hi> have of late built Forts in ſeveral Places upon this Continent, within the Territories of King <hi>GEORGE,</hi> which hath greatly diſturb'd our Peace in thoſe Par's; and I am inform'd, that they either have, or deſign ſoon to erect one on the River <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebeck,</hi> or the Carrying-Place called <hi>Wa-non-du-wa wan-nock,</hi> near the Head of it, which is within the Limits of this Government: If they ſhould be ſuffer'd to do that, <hi>Brethren,</hi> it would ſoon deſtroy your and our Peace upon this River.

               <p>'Further, <hi>Brethren,</hi> In order to hinder the <hi>French</hi> from making Incroachments upon the River <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> it is my Intention to build a ſtrong Houſe upon it, higher up than <hi>Richmond;</hi> and a large Magazine to lodge our Stores at, in our Way thither: And as this ſtrong Houſe will be nearer your Head-Quarters at <hi>Norridgwalk,</hi> than that at <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> is, I deſign to remove the Truck Trade from <hi>Richmond</hi> to that Place; ſo that then you will have leſs Way to come for your neceſſary Supplies than you now have: And in caſe we ſhould have a War with the <hi>French,</hi> (which we ſhall uſe all Means in our Power to prevent, and I hope will not happen) this ſtrong Houſe will be a Place of Shelter and Protection to you, as well as to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> againſt their Hoſtilities.</p>
               <p>'You will judge, <hi>Brethren,</hi> how well diſpos'd my Heart is towards you in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by my hiding from you nothing, which I have in it; and I hope you think what I ſay is right.</p>
               <p>'You moreover ſay, <hi>Brethren,</hi> in your Letter to me, that you <q>like well Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Dummer</hi>'s Treaty, and what was then done; and that Governour <hi>Dummer</hi> then ſet the Bounds between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and you.</q>

               </p>
               <p>'In the firſt of theſe Letters the <hi>Penobſcots</hi> told me, they expected I would come to St. <hi>George</hi>'s; and that they could not come to <hi>Falmouth</hi> to treat with me.</p>
               <p>'The <hi>Penobſcots</hi> alſo ſent me Word, ſince I came here, that they would not treat with me, unleſs I came to St. <hi>George</hi>'s.—And by a Letter I have in my Hand, I am ſatisfied they receiv'd this Advice from their Prieſt.</p>

'I can't but think therefore that you are miſtaken, when you tell me that any Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans now preſent are authorized to appear in behalf of the <hi>Penobſcots,</hi> and to act for them; ſince that Tribe hath declar'd to the contrary.'—</p>
               <p>The Governour made here a ſhort Pauſe, expecting an Anſwer from the Indians; but they ſeeming a little confounded, and making none, he proceeded;</p>
               <p>'I now look upon my ſelf as treating with your Tribe only.</p>
               <p>'I regard your Tribe as much as I do the <hi>Pencbſcots;</hi> and there is no Occaſion for their being preſent, or conſulted upon the principal Points of this Conference.</p>
               <p>'You ſay you ſtand by Governour <hi>Dummer</hi>'s Treaty; ſo do we.—Moſt of the Indians who were concern'd in making of it, are dead: Governour <hi>Dummer</hi> was then the Governour of this Province; but now I am the Governour of it.</p>
               <p>'It was therefore neceſſary, that that Treaty ſhould be committed to Writing, that Governour <hi>Dummer</hi>'s Succeſſors, and the preſent Generation of Indians might know what was then agreed upon in it.</p>
               <p>'You well know the Mark of <hi>Wenemouet, Loron, Edger-Emet,</hi> and the others of the principal Indians, who made and ſign'd that Treaty; and as they are dead, their Marks muſt now ſpeak for them.—'</p>
               <p>His Excellency then produc'd the original Treaty made with Governour <hi>Dummer</hi> to the Indians, who after having perus'd the Marks of the Indian Chiefs, which ſign'd it, obſerv'd to his Excellency that none of the <hi>Norridgwalks</hi> had ſign'd the Treaty.</p>

And at <hi>Falmouth,</hi> in 1749, your Tribe, the St. <hi>Francois, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobſcots</hi> and <hi>Weeweenocks,</hi> all ſign'd the Treaty then concluded: And by that Treaty you made the ſame Agreement with the Engliſh, which your Predeceſſors made with them in Governour <hi>Dummer</hi>'s Treaty.'</p>
               <p>[Then his Excellency produc'd to them the Treaty made and concluded at <hi>Falmouth</hi> in 1749,] and proceeded thus;</p>
               <p>'This Treaty, (<hi>viz</hi> of 1749,) was ratify'd by your Tribe the laſt Year; and the Year before; and ſeveral of you now preſent then ſign'd your Marks to it.'</p>

               <p>'I would put you in Mind of what happen'd in Times paſt; About 30 or 40 Years ago, the <hi>French</hi> ſtirr'd up your's and the neighbouring Indian Tribes, when they were at Peace with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to make War with them—The Indians during the Continuance of it committed Ravages in our Borders, and kill'd ſeveral of our People; But what Fruits did the Tribe of <hi>Norridgwalks</hi> reap, by the Miſchief which they then join'd in doing to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> they had ſeveral of their young Men cut off, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at laſt, being highly provok'd by their Hoſtilities, ſell upon the old Town of <hi>Norridgwalk,</hi> deſtroy'd many of the Tribe, and drove them all off from their Lands, which by Right of Condueſt in War (a Title held to be good by all the Indian Tribes in general among themſelves,) the <hi>Engliſh</hi> became Maſters of, and it was intirely ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>their</hi> Kindneſs to <hi>your</hi> Tribe, that you were reſtor'd to thoſe Lands by Governor <hi>Dummer</hi>'s Treaty, and ſuffer'd to return and live in Peace upon your preſent Poſſeſſions.</p>
               <p>'This Inſtance, <hi>Brethren,</hi> of the Calamity which going to War with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> brought upon your Tribe in that Day, and of the Kindneſs which they then ſhew'd to you, in permitting you to return and live again upon your Lands, after your Tribe had forfeited all Pretenſions to their Friendſhip by being guilty of a Breach of the moſt ſolemn Engagements, ſhould now be well conſider'd by you: And it ought to be a Warning to your never to ſuffer yourſelves to be ſeduced again by the <hi>French,</hi> to enter, into War with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which if it ſhould ever happen, muſt ſooner or later end in the Deſtruction of the ſmall Remnant of your Tribe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>'This was ratified by the Treaty of Peace made in 1749, and the <hi>Norridgwalks, Penobſcots, Arſſegunticooks,</hi> and <hi>Weeweenocks</hi> thereby engag'd further <q>That if any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians ſhould at any Time commit any Acts of Hoſtility againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they would join their young Men with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in reducing ſuch <hi>Indians</hi> to Reaſon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>'Now, <hi>Brethren,</hi> It hath unfortunately happen'd that two Indians of the <hi>Arſſegunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cook</hi> Tribe were kill'd the laſt Year, by two <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> in the Government of <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> for ſeveral Injuries and Inſults which theſe Indians had been guilty of within it: The Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of which I ſhall relate to you. In <hi>April</hi> 1752, two Indians of that Tribe named <hi>Sabatis</hi> and <hi>Chriſti,</hi> came to <hi>Canterbury</hi> in the aforeſaid Province, where they were friendly entertain'd above a Month; but at their going off they ſtole two Negroes, which they bound and carried over <hi>Merrimack</hi> River, where one of them made his Eſcape and return'd to his Maſter; but the other was carried to <hi>Canada,</hi> and ſold to a <hi>French</hi> Officer at <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> at which Place he ſtill remains; or was ſeen very lately.</p>
               <p>'In <hi>May</hi> following a Party of ten or twelve <hi>Arſſegunticook</hi> Indians met with four <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Men, at a Branch of <hi>Contoocook</hi> River, within the Government of <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> ſhot one of them dead upon the Spot, captivated and carried two of them to <hi>Canada,</hi> where they were detain'd ſome Months, and until they were ranſom'd; the other with Difficulty making his Eſcape: All which was done in Time of Peace.</p>
               <p>'In 1753, the aforenamed <hi>Sabatis</hi> came again to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where being reproached by the Wife of the Man, from whom he and his Companion had the Year before ſtolen the Negro, which they had ſold in <hi>Canada,</hi> he together with another Indian then in Company, was guilty of great Outrages to her; and it was by theſe and other Injuries and Inſults committed by them there, that the two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men were provok'd to kill them ſoon after; but the Government of <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> diſapproving the Action (as is well known from their Proceedings againſt the Perſons, who were ſuppos'd to be guilty of it) have diſclaim'd the private Revenge, which the two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men in their Province took of the <hi>Arſſegunticook</hi> Indians, for the Injuries and Inſults which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from them, and us'd Endeavours to bring to Puniſhment the Offenders, who were guilty of a Breach of the ſaid Treaties: And you ſee, Brethren, that that Government have now ſent three Commiſſioners to meet the <hi>Arſſegunticooks</hi> here, in order to have Injuries on both Sides redreſs'd in a Courſe of Juſtice, and an amicable Manner.</p>
               <p>'The <hi>Arſſegunticooks</hi> ought to have acted the like Part, and met us here, eſpecially as ſince they knew of the killing of thoſe two Indians, they renewed the Treaty of Peace made with the Governments of <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> in 1749, by ſigning a Ratification of it at <hi>Richmond</hi> in the Fall of the Year, and accepted Part of the Preſents which the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> made to the Indians upon that Occaſion; and join'd the laſt Winter with your Tribe and the <hi>Penobſcots,</hi> in preſſing me to meet them in theſe Parts early this Summer: But inſtead of doing this, they have within the laſt ſeven Weeks captivated an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, with his Wife and three Children in the Province of <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> and plunder'd his Houſe, as they did at the ſame Time the Houſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man in the Neighbourhood, which happen'd fortunately to have left it a Day or two before the Indians came: And they declare that they will take further Revenge upon the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for which Purpoſe they have a Party out now near <hi>Richmond,</hi> waiting for an Opportunity to do it.</p>

                  <p>'Notwithſtanding the Miſchief you have done us ſince the laſt Treaty of Peace; if you are determin'd to live peaceably with us for the future, and are deſirous of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Friendſhip with us, we will ſtill receive you as Friends and Brethren, and ſign the Ratiſications of the before-mention'd Treaties of Peace: But if your Hearts are not Right towards us, I would not have you ſign them; becauſe if after that, you ſhould commit any Acts of Hoſtility againſt us, you may depend upon it, we ſhall never truſt you again.</p>
                  <p>'And I would have you well conſider, that if you ſhould provoke us to be your Enemies by your Violation of this Peace, the Conſequence muſt in the End be the utter Deſtruction of the ſmall Part of your Tribe which ſtill remains.</p>

                  <p>'I expect that other Affairs of my Government will take up my whole Time; ſo that this will be the laſt Time I ſhall meet you upon this Interview.</p>

                  <p>Brethren,</p>
                  <p>'I have one Thing more to ſay to you: As you paſs from Town to Town great Damage is done by your Dogs in killing Sheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you ought to muzzle them to prevent theſe Miſchiefs; and I hope you will do it.</p>
                  <p>'I told you the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Government had made a Law to prevent the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from Hunting on your Lands. — You ſhall have it read and interpreted to you.</p>
                  <p>[Which was done accordingly.]</p>
                  <p>Brethren,</p>
                  <p>'I have one Word more to ſay to you before we part; and I wou'd have you well conſider it: —</p>
                  <p>'If you live in Peace with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> your Tribe may increaſe and multiply; but if you ſhould be unfortunately led into a War with us, your whole Tribe will in the End probably be deſtroy'd, and not a Man of it left to enjoy any of your Lands.</p>

'You well know that the Number of your Tribe does not now conſiſt of more than one third Part, it did of before the War with us in 1723 and 1724.</p>
                  <p>'I give you this Advice in the Sincerity of my Heart; and out of the Brotherly Kindneſs, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> bear to you: I have now done.'</p>

               <p>Then his Excellency drank the uſual Healths; which were pledg'd by the Indians; And after ſhaking Hands the Indians withdrew.</p>
               <p>The Indians having deſir'd, his Excellency would allow all their young Men and Squas to entertain him with a Dance in the Afternoon, his Excellency conſented, and was preſent at it with the Commiſſioners and other Gentlemen.</p>

               <p>THE principal Matters, for which the Expedition was concerted, being ſettled with the <hi>Norridgwalks, viz.</hi> The marching a Body of Troops through their Country, — the erecting of Forts higher up the River <hi>Kenneb<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There was now no colourable Pretence for the <hi>Penobſcots</hi> to make Objections to the Proceedings of the Government of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> had they been ever ſo ſtrongly diſpos'd to oppoſe them, after the Acquieſcence of the <hi>Norridgwalk</hi> Indians, who were the ſole Proprietors of that Part of the River and Country in queſtion, which had not been ſold by them to the Engliſh: His Excellency therefore determined to ſpeak with the <hi>Penobſcots</hi> on the Day of their Arrival; and accordingly order'd the Delegates to be conducted to him in the Afternoon, to the before-mention'd Place of Conference with the <hi>Norridgwalks.</hi> And, after the uſual Salutations,</p>

               <p>Then his Excellency order'd the Ratifications of the Treaty made by Lieut.

               <p>'The <hi>Arſſegunticook</hi> Indians were preſent the laſt Year at the Ratification of thoſe Treaties, agreed to them, and receiv'd the Governments Preſents.'</p>
