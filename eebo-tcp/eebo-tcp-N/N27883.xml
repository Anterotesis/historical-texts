            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>"YOUR condition, as to this world is indeed very low," replied the good Divine. "But what are mines, dungeons or gallies, to that eternal hopeleſs pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to which your unrepented ſin muſt ſoon have conſigned you. Even in this gloomy priſon, on this bed of ſtraw, worn down by pain, poverty, and want, forſaken by your worldly friends, an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſcorn to thoſe with whom you uſed to carouſe and riot; yet here, I ſay, brought thus low, if you have at laſt found out your own vileneſs; and your utterly undone ſtate by ſin, you may ſtill be more an object of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap> in the ſight of GOD, than when you thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> proſperous and happy; when the world ſmiled upon you, and you paſſed your days and nights in envied gaiety and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037148_0003_100C83B15A5F3498"/>unchriſtian riot. If you will but improve the preſent awful viſitation; if you do but heartily renounce and abhor your preſent evil courſes; if you even now turn to the Lord your Saviour with live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith, deep repentance, and unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obedience, I ſhall have more hope of you than of many who are going on quite happy, becauſe quite inſenſible. The heavy laden ſinner, who has diſcovered the iniquity of his own heart, and his utter inability to help himſelf, may be ſtill reſtored to GOD's ſavour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come happy, though in a dungeon. And be aſſured, that he who from deep and humble contrition dares not ſo much as lift up his eyes to heaven, when with a hearty faith he ſighs out, <hi>Lord be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me a sinner,</hi> ſhall in no wiſe be caſt out. Theſe are the words of him who cannot lie."</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to deſcribe the ſelf-abaſement, the grief, the joy, the ſhame, the hope, and the fear, which filled the mind of this poor man. A dawn of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort at length ſhone on his benighted
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037148_0003_100C83B15A5F3498"/>mind. His humility and fear of falling back into his former ſins, if he ſhould ever recover, Mr. Thomas thought were good ſymptoms of a ſound repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. He improved and cheriſhed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good diſpoſition he ſaw ariſing in his heart, and particularly warned him againſt ſelf-deceit, ſelf-confidence and hypocriſy.</p>
            <p>One day, when Mr. Thomas and Mr. Stock came to ſee him, they found him more than commonly affected. His face was more ghaſtly pale than uſual, and his eyes were red with crying. "Oh, Sir," ſaid he, "what a ſight have I juſt ſeen! Jolly George, as we uſed to call him, the ring-leader of all our mirth, who was at the bottom of all the fun, and tricks, and wickedneſs that are carried on within theſe walls, Jolly George is juſt dead of the jail diſtemper! He taken, and I left! I <hi>would</hi> be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into his room to ſpeak to him, to beg him to take warning by me, and that I might take warning by him. But what did I ſee! what did I hear! not one ſign of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037148_0004_100C83B3C922FD40"/>repentance; not one dawn of hope, Agony of body, blaſphemies on his tongue, deſpair in his ſoul, while I am ſpared and comforted with hopes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and acceptance. Oh, if all my old friends at the Greyhound could but then have ſeen Jolly George! A hundred Sermons about Death, Sir, don't ſpeak ſo home, and cut ſo deep, as the ſight of one dying ſinner."</p>
            <p>Brown grew gradually better in his health, that is, the fever mended, but the diſtemper ſettled in his limbs, ſo that he ſeemed likely to be a poor weakly cripple the reſt of his life. But as he ſpent much of his time in prayer, and in reading ſuch parts of the Bible as Mr. Thomas directed, he improved eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day in knowledge and piety, and of courſe grew more reſigned to pain and infirmity.</p>
            <p>Some months after this, his hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted father, who had never been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to ſee him, or offer him the leaſt relief, was taken off ſuddenly by a
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037148_0004_100C83B3C922FD40"/>fit of apoplexy; and, after all his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings, he died without a will. He was one of thoſe ſilly, ſuperſtitious men, who fancy they ſhall die the ſooner for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made one; and who love the world and the things that are in the world ſo dearly, that they dread to ſet about any buſineſs which may put them in mind that they are not always to live in it. As, by this neglect, his father had not fulfilled his threat of cutting him off with a ſhilling, Jack, of courſe, went ſhares with his brother in what their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left. What fell to him proved to be juſt enough to diſcharge him from priſon, and to pay all his debts, but he had nothing left. His joy at being thus inabled to make reſtitution was ſo great, that he thought little of his own wants. He did not deſire to conceal the moſt trifling debt, nor to keep a ſhilling for himſelf.</p>
            <p>Mr. Stock undertook to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> all his affairs. There did not remain money enough, after every creditor was ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even to pay for his removal to his
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037148_0005_100C83B5F9282BF0"/>own town. Mr. Stock kindly ſent his cart for him with a bed in it, made as comfortable as poſſible, for he was too weak and lame to be removed any other way, and Mr. Stock gave the driver a particular charge to be tender and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of him, and not to drive hard nor to leave the cart a moment.</p>
            <p>Mr. Stock would fain have taken him into his own houſe, at leaſt for a time, ſo convinced was he of his ſincere refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation both of heart and life; But Brown could not be prevailed on to be further burdenſome to this generous friend. He inſiſted on being carried to the pariſh work-houſe, which he ſaid was a far better place than he deſerved. In this houſe Mr. Stock furniſhed a ſmall room for him, and ſent him every day a morſel of meat from his own din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Tommy Williams begged that he might always be allowed to carry it, as ſome atonement for his having for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo far forgotten his duty, as rather to rejoice than ſympathize in Brown's misfortunes. He never thought of this
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037148_0005_100C83B5F9282BF0"/>fault without ſorrow, and often thanked his maſter for the wholeſome leſſon he then gave him, and he was the better for it all his life.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Stock often carried poor Brown a bit of tea or a baſon of good broth her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He was quite a cripple, and never able to walk out as long as he lived. Mr. Stock, Will Simpſon, and Tommy Williams laid their heads together, and contrived a ſort of barrow on which he was often carried to church by ſome of his poor neighbours, of which Tommy was always one; and he requited their kindneſs, by reading a good book to them whenever they would call in, or teaching their children to ſing Pſalms or ſay the catechiſm.</p>
            <p>It was no ſmall joy to him thus to be enabled to go to church. Whenever he was carried by the Greyhound he was much moved, and uſed to put up a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er full of repentance for the paſſ, and praiſe for the preſent.</p>

               <head>A Dialogue between James Stock and Will Simpson, as they sat at their Work.</head>
               <p>James Stock, and his journeyman Will Simpſon, as I informed my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the ſecond part of the Two Shoemaker's, had reſolved to work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one hour every evening in order to pay for Tommy Williams's ſchooling. This circumſtance brought them to be a good deal together when the reſt of the men where gone home. Now it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that Mr. Stock had a mighty way of endeavouring to turn all common events to ſome uſe; and he thought it right on the preſent occaſion to make the only return in his power to Will Simpſon for his great kindneſs. For, ſaid he, if Will gives up ſo much of his time to help me to provide for this poor boy, it is the leaſt I can do to try to turn part of that time to the purpoſe of promoting Will's ſpiritual good. Now as the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t of Stock's own mind was religious, it was eaſy to him to lead their talk to ſomething profitable. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037148_0006_100C95BCB937BC50"/>took eſpecial care however, that the ſubject ſhould be introduced proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, cheerfully, and without conſtraint. As he well knew that great good may be ſometimes done by a prudent attention in ſeizing proper opportunities, ſo he knew that the cauſe of piety had been ſometimes hurt by forcing ſerious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects where there was clearly no diſpoſition to receive them. I ſay he had found out that two things were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the promoting religion among his friends; a warm zeal to be always on the watch for occaſions, and a cool judgment to diſtinguiſh which was the right time and place to make uſe of them. To know <hi>how</hi> to do good is a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but to know <hi>when</hi> to do it is no ſmall one.</p>
               <p>Simpſon was an honeſt good-natured fellow; he was now become ſober, and rather religiouſly diſpoſed. But he was ignorant, he did not know much of the grounds of religion, or of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own nature; he was regular at church, but was firſt drawn thither rather
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037148_0007_100C95BEDB734860"/>by his ſkill in pſalm-ſinging than by any great devotion. He had left off going to the Greyhound, and often read the Bible or ſome other good book on the Sunday evening. This he thought was quite enough; he thought the Bible was the prettieſt hiſtory book in the world, and that religion was a very good thing for Sundays. But he did not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what buſineſs people had with it on working days. He had left off drinking becauſe it had brought Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams to the grave, and his wife to dirt and rags; but not becauſe he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had ſeen the evil of ſin. He now conſidered ſwearing and ſabbath breaking as ſcandalous and indecent, but he had not found out that both were to be left off becauſe they are highly offenſive to God, and grieve his Holy Spirit. As Simpſon was leſs ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited than moſt ignorant people are, Stock had always a good hope that when he ſhould come to be better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the word of God, and with the evil of his own heart, he would become one day a good Chriſtian. The
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037148_0007_100C95BEDB734860"/>great hindrance to this was, that he fancied himſelf ſo already.</p>
               <p>One evening Simpſon had been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Stock's mind how diſorderly the houſe and ſhop, where they were now ſitting quietly at work, had formerly been, and he went on thus;</p>

It was not ſaints and martyrs only to whom our Saviour ſaid that they muſt "cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the world with its affections and luſts." We are called to "be holy" in our meaſure and degree, "as he who hath called us is holy." It was not only ſaints and martyrs who were told that they muſt be "like-minded with Chriſt"— That "they muſt do all to the glory of God"—That they muſt renounce the ſpirit of the world, and deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves." It was not to apoſtles only that Chriſt ſaid, "they muſt have their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in Heaven. It was not to a few holy men ſet apart for the altar, that he ſaid, "they muſt ſet their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on things above"—That they "muſt not be conformed to the world." No, it was to Fiſhermen, to Publicans, to Farmers, to Day-labourers, to poor Tradeſmen, that he ſpoke when he told

                  <p>All this might be very proper for <hi>them</hi> to be taught, becauſe they had not been bred up Chriſtians, but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens or Jews: and Chriſt wanted to make them his followers, that is, Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.

                  <p>I think it comes by a good education or a good example. When a fellow who has got any ſenſe ſees a man cut off in his prime by drinking, I think he will begin to leave it off. When he ſees another man reſpected, like you, maſter, for honeſty and ſobriety,

                  <p>I agree with you, that he who does both gives the beſt outward ſigns that he is good as you call it. But our going to Church, and even reading the Bible, are no proofs that we are as good as we need be, but rather that we do both theſe in order to make us better than we are. We do both on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, as means, by God's bleſſing, to make us better all the week. We are to bring the fruits of that Chapter or of that Sermon into our daily life, and try to get our inmoſt heart and ſecret thoughts, as well as our daily conduct, amended by them.</p>

                  <p>What, maſter, always to be thinking about Religion?</p>

                  <p>No, far from it Will; much leſs to be always talking about it. But you muſt always be acting under it's power and ſpirit.</p>

                  <p>But ſurely 'tis pretty well if I do this when I go to Church; or while I am ſaying my prayers.

                  <speaker>Stock.</speaker>
                  <p>Very true, Will. Twould be no proof of our religion to let our cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomers go barefoot; but 'twould be a proof of our lazineſs, and we ſhould ſtarve as we ought to do. The buſineſs of the world muſt not only be carried on, but carried on with ſpirit and activ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. We have the ſame authority for not being ſlothful in buſineſs as we have for being fervent in ſpirit. Religion
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037148_0012_100C95CA2A9F1260"/>has put godlineſs and lazineſs as wide aſunder as any two things in the world; and what God has ſeparated, let no man pretend to join. Indeed, the ſpirit of religion can have no fellowſhip with ſloth, indolence, and ſelf-indulgence. But ſtill, a chriſtian does not carry on his common trade quite like another man neither; for ſomething of the ſpirit which he labours to attain at church, he carries with him into his worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. While there are ſome who ſet up for Sunday chriſtians, who have no notion that that they are bound to be week-day chriſtians too.</p>

                  <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, maſter, I do think, if God Almighty is contented with one day in ſeven, he won't thank you for throwing him the other ſix into the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. I thought he gave us them for our own uſe; and I am ſure nobody works harder all the week than you do.</p>

                  <p>Becauſe a man's trials in trade being often greater, they give him freſh means of glorifying God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſincerity of religion.

                  <p>No, no, Will; trade and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs don't create evil paſſions—they were in the heart before—Only now and then they ſeem to lie ſnug a little—our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns with the world bring them out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to action a little more, and thus ſhew both others and ourſelves what we real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are.

                  <p>Suppoſe, now, a man had a wife and children whom he loved, and wiſhed to ſerve, would not he be often thinking about them while he was at work? and though he would not be <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways</hi> thinking about them, yet would not the very love he bore them be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037148_0014_100C95CD9311D218"/>ſpur to his induſtry? He would always be purſuing the ſame courſe from the ſame motive, though his words and even his thoughts muſt often be taken up in the common tranſactions of life.</p>

                  <p>I will ſhew that both muſt go together. I will ſuppoſe you were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to buy ſo many ſkins of our currier —that is quite a worldly tranſaction —you cant ſee what a ſpirit of religion has to do with buying a few calves' ſkins. Now, I tell you it has a great deal to do with it. Covetouſneſs, a deſire to make a good bargain, may riſe up in your heart. Selfiſhneſs, a ſpirit of monopoly, a wiſh to get all, in order to diſtreſs others; theſe are evil deſires, and muſt be ſubdued. Some opportunity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair gain offers, in which there may be much ſin, and yet little ſcandal. Here a Chriſtian will ſtop ſhort, he will recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, "that he who maketh haſte to be rich ſhall hardly be innocent." Perhaps
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037148_0015_100C95CF4FECD3F8"/>the ſin may be on the ſide of your dealer —<hi>he</hi> may want to overreach <hi>you</hi>—this is provoking—you are tempted to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent anger, perhaps to ſwear,—here is a freſh demand on you for a ſpirit of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and moderation, as there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for a ſpirit of juſtice and ſelf-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. If, by God's grace, you get the victory over theſe temptations, you are the better man for having been called out to them; always provided, that the temptations be not of your own ſeeking. If you give way, and ſink under theſe temptations, don't go and ſay that trade and buſineſs have made you covetous, paſſionate, and prophane. No, no; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it, you were ſo before; you would have had all theſe evil ſeeds lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your heart, if you had been loit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering about at home and doing nothing, with the additional ſin of idleneſs into the bargain. When you are buſy, the devil often tempts you; when you are idle, you tempt the devil. If buſineſs and the world call theſe evil tempers into action, buſineſs and the world call that religion into action too which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037148_0015_100C95CF4FECD3F8"/>us to reſiſt them. And in this you ſee the Week-day fruit of the Sunday's pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 'Tis trade and buſineſs in the week which call us to put our Sunday read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, praying, and church-going into practice.</p>

                  <p>Well, maſter, you have a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical way, ſome how, of coming over one. I never ſhould have thought there would have been any religion wanted in buying and ſelling a few calves' ſkins. But, I begin to ſee there is a good deal in what you ſay.—And, whenever I am doing a common action, I will try to remember that it muſt be done after a godly ſort.</p>

                  <p>I hear the clock ſtrike nine— let us leave off our work. I will only obſerve further, that one good end of our bringing religion into our buſineſs is, to put us in mind not to undertake more buſineſs than we can carry on conſiſtent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with our religion. I ſhall never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that man's diligence, though it is often commended by the world, who
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037148_0016_100C95D31CFEAB20"/>is not diligent about the ſalvation of his ſoul. We are as much forbidden to be overcharged with the <hi>cares</hi> of life as with it's <hi>pleasures.</hi> I only wiſh to prove to you, that a diſcreet Chriſtian may be wiſe for both worlds; that he may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his hands without entangling his ſoul, and labour for the meat that periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth without neglecting that which endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth unto eternal life; that he may be prudent for time, while he is wiſe for eternity.</p>

            <head>EXTRACT From a late AUTHOR, on Detraction.</head>
            <p>SUSURRUS is a pious, temperate, good man remarkable for abundance of excellent qualities; no one more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant at the ſervice of the church, or whoſe heart is more affected with it; his charity is ſo great, that he almoſt ſtarves himſelf, to be able to give great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er alms to the poor.</p>
            <p>Yet Suſurrus had a prodigious failing along with theſe great virtues.</p>
            <p>He had a mighty inclination to hear and diſcover all the defects and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all about him. You was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to tell him any thing of any body, provided that you did not do it in the ſtyle of an enemy. He never diſliked an evil-ſpeaker, but when his language was rough and paſſionate. If you would but whiſper any thing gently, tho' it was ever ſo bad in itſelf, Suſurrus was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receive it.</p>
            <p>When he viſits, you generally hear him relating how ſorry he is for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects and failings of ſuch a neighbour.
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037148_0018_100C95D6DE3615C8"/>He is always letting you know how ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he is of the reputation of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; how loth to ſay that which he is forced to ſay; and how gladly he would conceal it, if it could be concealed.</p>
            <p>Suſurrus had ſuch a tender, compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate manner of relating things the moſt prejudicial to his neighbour, that he ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſeemed, both to himſelf and others to be exerciſing a chriſtian charity, at the ſame time that he was indulging a whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering, evil-ſpeaking temper.</p>
            <p>Suſurrus once whiſpered to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar friend in great ſecrecy, ſomething too bad to be ſpoke of publickly. He ended with ſaying, how glad he was that it had not yet took wind, and that he had ſome hopes it might not be true, tho' the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions were very ſtrong. His friend made him this reply:</p>
            <p>You ſay, Suſurrus, that you are glad it has not yet taken wind; and that you have ſome hopes it may not prove true. Go home therefore to your cloſet, and pray to God for this man, in ſuch a manner, and with ſuch earneſtneſs, as you would pray for yourſelf on the like occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:037148_0019_100C95D870E8F730"/>Beſeech God to interpoſe in his fav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, to ſave him from falſe accuſers, and bring all thoſe to ſhame, who by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable whiſpers, and ſecret ſtories wound him, like thoſe that ſtab in the dark. And when you have made this prayer, then you may, if you pleaſe, go tell the ſame ſecret to ſome other friend, that you have told to me.</p>
            <p>Suſurrus was exceedingly affected with this rebuke, and felt the force of it upon his conſcience, in as lively a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if he had ſeen the books open'd at the day of judgment.</p>
            <p>All other arguments might have been reſiſted; but it was impoſſible for Suſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus either to reject, or to follow this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, without being equally ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the higheſt degree.</p>
            <p>From that time to this, he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly uſed himſelf to this method of interceſſion; and his heart is ſo entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed by it, that he can now no more privately whiſper any thing to the prejudice of another, than he can open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray to God to do people hurt.</p>
