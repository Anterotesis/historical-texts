            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Truth is great, and will prevail.</head>
            <p>THIS maxim has been aſſented to in all countries, and in all ages; but the grand queſtion has been, WHAT IS TRUTH? Pilate aſked it, but waited not for the anſwer. So far from it, that the fear of man moved him to give ſentence againſt the eternal SON OF GOD, who came into our world on purpoſe to <hi>bear witneſs unto</hi> THE TRUTH. Jews and Gentiles were confederates in this helliſh act, and all nations and denominations ever ſince have been more agreed in oppoſing the truth, than in any other point: Yet truth prevails ſtill.</p>
            <p>That there is one ſupreme BEING, whoſe kingdom ruleth over all, is the firſt and capital article of truth, which no nation upon earth were ever able to eraſe entirely out of their minds; for no government could ever be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among themſelves, without appeals to HIM for the truth of what was aſſerted, and to avenge injuſtice, and the violation of contracts and engagements.</p>
            <p>That it is the indiſpenſable duty of every man to love his creator and preſerver with all his faculties and powers, and to love his neighbour as himſelf, is a truth inſeparably connected with the other: For while JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH remains infinitely and unchangeably good, and we remain his offspring, our obligation to love him can never be diſannulled or abated; and his command, to love our neighbours as ourſelves, is as immutable as his perfections are.</p>
            <p>That all mankind, in their natural condition, are in a ſtate of revolt from this heavenly ruler, is a truth as evident as the other; what need elſe could there be for
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017083_0004_0F9FC224052828F0"/>theſe appeals and reſtraints? The attempts that have often been made againſt this truth, have always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it, and have demonſtrated the corruption of the authors of thoſe attempts. Nothing can diſcover a more mean and diſhoneſt diſpoſition, than for a perſon to ſteal the property of another, and then to labour to adorn and exalt himſelf therewith, while he tries hard to ſink the credit of the true owner, ſo as to ſet ſelf above him: Yet this is the very practice of all thoſe who ſet up their reaſon above divine revelation. The writings of the greateſt men in Pagan countries are full of the intrigues, adulteries, thefts and murders, of their imaginary deities; which, by God's righteous judgment, and from their natural tendency, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced like abominations in their worſhippers; becauſe they <hi>changed the truth of God into a lie.</hi> Rom. i. 18—32. And thoſe who were favoured with the oracles of God, and yet did the <hi>ſame thing,</hi> thereby brought upon themſelves a much greater condemnation than the others did. Rom. ii. 1—24. If ſo, then what advantage can it be to have thoſe oracles? Anſwer, <hi>much every way: For what if ſome did not believe?</hi> Shall their <hi>unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</hi> The thought is to be rejected with the utmoſt abhorrence. <hi>Yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that thou mighteſt be juſtified in thy ſayings, and mighteſt overcome when thou art judged.</hi> Rom. iii. 1—4. This is the exact ſtate of the controverſy. Men have aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the judgment ſeat, and have arraigned the <hi>ſayings of God</hi> to their bar. This practice began near the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den tree, Gen. iii. 1—6; and from that day to this men have been <hi>ever learning,</hi> and yet, of themſelves, were <hi>never able to come to the knowledge of the truth;</hi> and that becauſe the judge is the criminal, who cannot live in that way any longer than he is kept in darkneſs;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017083_0005_0F9FC224B95B74D8"/>for whenever the authority of truth takes place in his conſcience, <hi>ſin revives, and he dies;</hi> and his only way of relief is by faith in the perfect obedience and atoning ſacrifice of our great ſurety, who <hi>offered himſelf without ſpot to God.</hi> Rom. vii. 1—12, Heb. ix 14, and x. 1—14. Unaſſiſted reaſon could never go any farther in this reſpect, than to move men to imbrue their hands in the blood of their own children, by offering the fruit of their body for the ſin of their ſoul: Yet many are now guilty of ſtealing a finer dreſs for human nature, from the oracles of God, and then of improving the ſame againſt the authority of the book they took it from; ſo that inſtead of ſaying, let God be true, but every man a liar; their argument is, that every man is not a liar, therefore in ſeveral points God does not ſpeak the truth! And it is a common thing for theſe reaſoners, to claim a power for themſelves which they deny to JEHOVAH; and daily to practiſe that, under his name, which, with reverence be it ſpoken, was never within HIS POWER to do! Num. xxiii. 19, John x. 35, 2d Tim. ii. 13, Heb. vi. 18.</p>
            <p>They often inſiſt upon it, that men cannot deſerve praiſe for doing right, nor blame for doing wrong, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they have power within themſelves to act with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or againſt motive, as they pleaſe. If their volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry actions are not determined by what is within them, they ſay they are not free. Yet the ſame men are poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that God's choice of ſome to ſalvation, while he leaves the reſt to peris;h in their ſins, muſt be determined by what he ſees in them, and not in himſelf; or elſe, ſay they, he would be a reſpecter of perſons. Thus ſelf-determination is claimed for man, but is denied to God; directly in the face of Chriſt, and the inſpired apoſtle. Matt. xi. 26, Rom. xi. 33—36. The evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent cauſe of this horrid impiety, is a ſecret conceit,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017083_0006_0F9FC225826F0430"/>that there is a good to be obtained which is better than truth, and for which truth may be diſpenſed with, and contradicted; therefore, though it is impoſſible for God to lie, or to deny himſelf, yet men often do it, in hopes of obtaining that imaginary good. Indeed Chriſt calls us to deny ourſelves, and to take-up our croſs dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but it is only that corrupt and deluſive ſelf, which is ſet up againſt the revealed will of God. He requires us daily to croſs our luſts, and ſelf-righteous conceits; while Satan tempts us to croſs the truth, and the light of our own conſciences; and can any rational ſoul heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate a minute upon which of them is to be regarded!</p>
            <p>That all men have a power within them to act in every caſe as then ſeems beſt to them, is a truth as fully given into by the advocates for divine ſovereignty, as by any free-willer on earth. Perhaps Dr. Owen opened and defended the great doctrines of ſovereign grace, as well as any man did in the laſt century; and he ſays, <q>to ſuppoſe that in all things of ſpiritual and eternal concernment, men are not determined and acted eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one by his own judgment, is an imagination of men who think but little of what they are, or do, or ſay, or write. Even thoſe who ſhut their eyes againſt the light, and follow in the herd,, reſolving not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into any of theſe things, do it becauſe <hi>they judge it beſt for them ſo to do</hi>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:017083_0007_0F9FC22807829B80"/>With which I fully concur; for we can as eaſily put an end to our exiſtence, as we can keep from chooſing what went preſent view or imagine to be beſt. Pharaoh did ſo in all his attempts to hold Iſrael in bondage; and ſo he and his people did, when they <hi>were glad to let Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael depart, with rich treaſures:</hi> And the Lord's deſign therein was, <hi>that they might obſerve</hi> HIS <hi>ſtatutes, and keep</hi> HIS <hi>laws.</hi> Pſalm cv. 37—45. Yet how unwilling are many, even in this land of goſpel light, to yield their ſouls to this authority? Being called by our churches to act as their agent in this great affair, I have had cauſe to know more of the averſion of many thereto, than moſt others have; of which take the following plain account.</p>
            <p>When a new plan of government was formed for the Maſſachuſetts State, which took in their old taxing laws for religious teachers, I was called to meet our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee at Boſton upon it, in February, 1778. And find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſaid plan was to be eſtabliſhed or ſet aſide by our next General Court, we drew up a petition, directed to them, that it might be fixed, <q>as a fundamental principle of our conſtitution, that religious miniſters ſhall be ſupported only by Chriſt's authority, and not at all by aſſeſſment and ſecular force.</q> This was ſigned by many, in various parts of the State, which alarmed the miniſters who were ſupported by tax and compulſion; and one of them, who was called to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the election ſermon to that Aſſembly, ſaid therein, <q>the fear and reverence of God, and the terrors or eternity, are the moſt powerful reſtraints upon the minds of men.—Let the reſtraints of religion once be broken down, as they infallibly would be by leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubject of public worſhip to the humours of the multitude, and we might well defy all human wiſdom and power to ſupport and preſerve order and

                  </note>.</q> And a gentleman who had been one of our legiſlators, hearing that ſome of his townſmen were going to be baptized, on the 26th of June following, went at the head of a large mob, and violently interrupted their worſhip upon their own lands; for which breach of the public peace he was ſo far from receiving any puniſhment, that he was one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention that formed our preſent plan of government, and is a member of the firſt legiſlature which has acted thereon. In September, 1778, a miniſter of the firſt church in Boſton, hearing of the defeat of our army on Rhode-Iſland, delivered a lecture before many of our rulers, from the ſeventh of Joſhua, wherein he tried hard to perſuade them, that one of the <hi>accurſed things</hi> which cauſed that defeat, was becauſe a new law had not been made and enforced, to help miniſters about their ſalaries. This ſermon being printed, a writer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Mr. Gill's paper of October 8, with a high commendation of it, and declaring that the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made therein, of the caſe of miniſters, <q>was with that noble plainneſs and fidelity which are among the diſtinguiſhing characteriſtics of that gentleman. But (ſays he) although the General Aſſembly has now been ſitting for ſome time, no motion (as I can learn) has as yet been made, or is likely to be made, for this purpoſe—Are the<note n="†" place="bottom">The word <hi>clergy</hi> ſignifies <hi>heritage;</hi> and to avoid the cenſure of <hi>lording</hi> it over the church, officers have uſurped the name to themſelves.

            <p>This paper I received in Boſton on February 13; and the ſame day received a little pamphlet, wherein I and my brethren, in our exerciſe of diſcipline, are accuſed of advancing faſt in a way that will ſoon bring us, if a ſtop is not put thereto, <q>to outking all kings, outbiſhop all biſhops, and outpope all popes;</q> ſigned by two Baptiſt brethren<note n="*" place="bottom">Remarks on a council at Chelmsford, October <hi>19, 1780,</hi> p. <hi>12.</hi>
               </note>. And whether theſe two parties of accuſers do not fulfil the words of the inſpired apoſtle (Acts xx. 29, 30) may be conſidered. It is a known fact, that a miniſter of the firſt church in Boſton has, for many years, acted at the head of the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017083_0013_0F9FC231788C0360"/>teachers who are ſupported by tax and compulſion, and has written the moſt to uphold that cauſe in New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, of any man upon earth. And I am greatly miſtaken if both he, and theſe Baptiſt accuſers, have not openly pleaded for the worſt error that ever was known in this world; namely, that perfect obedience to the moral law is not the indiſpenſable duty of all the human race. I meddle not with their internal ſtate, any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than their fruits diſcover the ſame; and ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with ſaid miniſter in Boſton.</p>
            <p>After Robert Sandeman, with his ſatyrical pen, had, in a convincing manner, expoſed the corruption of thoſe who imagine, that reconciliation to God can take its riſe from any thing good in man, Dr. Chauncy publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a volume of ſermons, in which he ſays, <q>it is ſaid by moſt Chriſtian writers, that the firſt man was ſo placed, under the natural or moral law of God, as that he muſt work his way to life by perfectly doing all things commanded by it; inſomuch that he could not have obtained it, but by perſevering obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in every point of duty, without the leaſt failure. But this is ſaid entirely without book. The ſcripture nowhere inſinuates, that he was under <hi>ſuch a covenant of works.</hi> It ſuggeſts, on the contrary, that God, in favour to him, did not put him upon ſo <hi>ſevere</hi> a trial for life. His trial, if we may believe the ſacred record of it, was in a <hi>ſingle inſtance,</hi> and this not of doing, but of forbearing to do. Gen. ii. 16, 17.—It would be the exact truth, ſhould I ſay, that the parents of men, while innocent, in common with their poſterity ſince the lapſe, could have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained life in no way but that of <hi>grace through faith</hi>

                  </note>.</q> I will do this writer the honor to ſay, that he has here ſtated their ſentiments with as much fairneſs and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017083_0014_0F9FC23236AFDCD8"/>as any that I ever ſaw upon that ſide of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. And the difference betwixt his ideas and mine about this matter is chiefly upon the following points.
<list>
                  <item>1. He ſuppoſes that Adam was to work his way <hi>to life,</hi> after he was created; but I believe that the <hi>image of God, in which he was created,</hi> was his life.</item>
                  <item>2. I know that faith in God was as neceſſary then for the <hi>continuance</hi> of life, as it is now in Chriſt for the <hi>recovery</hi> thereof; but <hi>grace,</hi> in the goſpel ſenſe of the word, means relief to the guilty and miſerable, in diſtinction from <hi>works,</hi> which innocent man was to have lived by, if he had continued in that ſtate. Debt means the reward that is promiſed, which becomes due when the condition of it is performed; and that reward may then be claimed by law, whatever difference there is in value betwixt the work and the reward. The angels of light will ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge an infinite difference between their works and the reward they receive therefor; which at the ſame time is as diſtinct from free grace to ſinners, as heaven is from earth. It deſtroys the nature, both of grace and works, to confound them together. Rom. xi. 6. God never fails to pay all his debts; and ſooner or later he will make all to know his right to <hi>give grace and glory</hi> to whom he pleaſeth, while he juſtly inflicts endleſs puniſhment upon impenitent ſinners. How ſolemn and convincing is that demand, <hi>is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil becauſe I am good!</hi> Matt. xx. 15. He is the fountain of all good; and the root of all error is a conceit that good can be had in ſome other way, better than in obedience to his revealed will. James i. 13—25.</item>
                  <item>3. This author ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that perfect and perſevering obedience, in every point of duty required by the moral law, would have been too <hi>ſevere a trial</hi> for life to innocent Adam; which in my view is ſo contrary to truth, that a turning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017083_0015_0F9FC2333648CA20"/>was his death. The forbidden tree was the teſt, to try whether or not he would regard God's ſovereignty over all, and his property in all the creatures he had made; and by taking and eating of that fruit man rebelled againſt HEAVEN, and ſeized upon the earth as his own. And when our Saviour came, the Jews, from the ſame principle, ſaid, <hi>this is the heir, come let us kill him, and let us ſeize on his inheritance.</hi> Matt. xxi. 38. Every wiſe ruler will lay his plans ſo as to need as little altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereafter as may be, and never to be defeated or diſappointed in his deſigns, if he can help it; yet thoſe who firmly hold, and boldly aſſert, that JEHOVAH'S plan is abſolutely perfect in all theſe reſpects, ſo that <hi>nothing can be put to it, not any thing taken from it,</hi> are often looked upon and treated as the worſt of men; and that becauſe men are not willing to <hi>fear before</hi> HIM. Eccl. iii. 14. Our Saviour was ſo far from removing or abating this fear, that he greatly enforced it; and when Peter would fondly have prevented his dying for us, he rejected the attempt, with the ſame deteſtation as he would have ſhewn to the devil himſelf; and alſo aſſures us, that the only time for having our debts paid by him, is before we are <hi>caſt into priſon.</hi> Matt. v. 17—26, and xvi. 23. Nor can the conceit of thoſe, who deny the endleſs puniſhment of ſuch as die in an impenitent ſtate, be true, till rebellion againſt HEAVEN ſhall become a finite evil, ſo that finite doings and ſufferings, either in this or another world, can purge it away. Nor, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, till JEHOVAH ſhall become a <hi>ſervant</hi> to periſhing worms, ſo as to go and come at their bidding or call. Job xxi. 14, 15, Iſa. xxvii. 11, and xliii. 24, Jer. ii. 27, Acts iv. 12, Dan. xii. 2.</item>

            </p>
            <p>The caſe of the Baptiſt accuſers, before mentioned, is as follows. On Sept. 8, 1767, a number of our elders and brethren met at Warren, and agreed upon an annual
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017083_0016_0F9FC235EC145128"/>meeting, under the name of the Warren Aſſociation; the deſign whereof they ſince publiſhed in theſe words, viz. "we are not inſenſible of the attempts that have been made by miniſters, in various ways, to aſſume a claſſical power and juriſdiction over the churches; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we unaware of the evil and pernicious effects of their obtaining ſuch a power; which therefore we deſire we may always watch againſt. Yet, as it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the churches in the apoſtolic age did, by meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers and letters, hold a friendly correſpondence with each other, for mutual advice, help and comfort, and ſometimes by the meeting of many of them together for that purpoſe; and as we are commanded to follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the things that make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another, we have been convinced, that it is both warrantable and expedient for our churches, that are ſo much ſcattered through this land, and who have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore been ſo much unacquainted with each other, thus, to aſſociate together for prayer, preaching of the word, mutual advice and endeavours to promote union and goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel order among them, and to guard againſt the contrary; as well as to afford what aſſiſtance we can to flocks that are deſtitute, weak or oppreſſed." This was publiſhed in Sept. 1771; and this plan has been ſo fully obſerved, that no <hi>appeals</hi> of any perſonal caſe of diſcipline in any church, nor <hi>complaints</hi> againſt any other community of Chriſtians, have ever been admitted by the Aſſociation; and it ſtands on record in our church book, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any ſuch thing would break the conditions that we joined them upon. They have been ſo far from it, that when a breach of communion once happened betwixt two churches in the Aſſociation, which affected others, and an attempt from thence was made to bring the caſe before this body, it was poſitively refuſed; and the contending parties were prevailed with, to agree in
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017083_0017_0F9FC235F6354608"/>calling a few judicious men, to hear and labour with them upon it; and ſuch a bleſſing was granted upon theſe means, as entirely to remove the difficulty. Yet one Baptiſt teacher has diſcovered ſome diſlike to our Aſſociation for ten years paſt, which might partly be cauſed by information, that by this means was ſpread, of his preſuming to break bread to a minor part of a Baptiſt church, whom the majority had cenſured; this information being an impediment in the way of his preaching elſewhere. His mind has alſo been ſomewhat intangled with Sandeman's notion, of exalting the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſuch a manner as to pay little or no regard to a divine work <hi>within us,</hi> of conviction by the law, and relief by the goſpel. And, in preaching at Chelmsford laſt ſpring, he delivered ſuch <hi>queſtions about the law,</hi> as greatly burdened the church who heard it; though one or two members were pleaſed therewith, they having privately propagated ſuch queſtions there for ſome years. When ſaid teacher came there again in the fall, the church refuſed to admit him to preach therein again, till he ſhould give them ſatisfaction. Upon this two brethren got five or ſix ſiſters to join with them in openly withdrawing from the church, and ſetting up a ſeparate meeting near by, to hear that teacher, without ſtating the principles they differed upon. A council was ſoon after called by the church, whereof I was ſcribe; and when we had gone through with hearing other caſes, the church was deſirous of laying this alſo before us. Said teacher and brethren were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and though they were not active in calling the council, and were unwilling to ſubmit any cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as ſuch, yet they conſented to diſcourſe with us upon theſe affairs. This was done for about two hours; and then we ſaid in our reſult, "it appears plainly, that they hold, that God the Father has given the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017083_0018_0F9FC2360529D6A0"/>of the world into the hands of his Son, in ſuch a manner, that none of the human race are now under the curſe of the law that was given to Adam; and that Chriſt's miniſters are ſo far from being called to preach that law, and to tell any men that they are under the curſe of it, that they queſtioned with earneſtneſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo to preach is not to preach a lie! Which opinion we fully believe to be contrary to the holy ſcriptures of truth, and of a very dangerous and pernicious tendency to the ſouls of men; and therefore we earneſtly call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe brethren to retract it, and warn all againſt it." Great relief was hereby given to the church, and two valuable men were baptized, and added thereto the next Lord's day. I gave no copies of our reſult to any but the churches immediately concerned; yet thoſe two brethren, who ſigned this publication againſt us, ſay, "every Chriſtian man's character is too ſacred to be toſt about at the pleaſure of every one.—For a ſelect number from ſeveral churches to undertake to judge ſuch caſes, may well alarm us to look about us, and ſee where our privileges are going; for we think it is not hard to ſee what ſuch aſſuming councils are aiming at. This council have excommunicated two brethren—this ſolemn warning is like hanging them in gibbets.—But may indulgent heaven interpoſe for us, ſeeing vain is the help of man<note n="*" place="bottom">Remarks, p. <hi>4, 11, 12.</hi>
               </note>."</p>
            <p>How far their paſſions have carried them beyond the truth, is left to conſideration. They had aſſumed the power to make a ſchiſm in that church, and to write an account of it, by ſaid teacher, to the paſtor of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther church, whom they hoped to have drawn to their party, before we met there in council; and we did no more to them than I have related, let them call it by what name they will. They own that they aſked the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017083_0019_0F9FC236E42DBBE8"/>queſtion we have mentioned, and alſo the following, viz. "if any of the human race are under the law, in the ſame ſenſe, and upon the ſame conditions, as it was delivered to Adam, what will ever bring them from under it, ſeeing Chriſt dieth no more?" And they now ſay, "we hold, that mankind are not without law to God, but under law to Chriſt: Now the law of Chriſt, which mankind are now under, is for ſubſtance the ſame which was given to Adam, namely, to love God and our neighbour; but it is not given to men, nor are men holden under it upon the ſame terms and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as it was given to Adam.<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid. p. <hi>7, 9.</hi>
               </note>."</p>
            <p>In my view, this is ſo far from <hi>rightly dividing the word of truth,</hi> that it is really a <hi>confounding</hi> of law and grace together. They have taken words which are peculiar to the regenerate, 1 Cor. ix. 21, and have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied them to all the human race, which, alas! is too common through the world! Our Saviour plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the moral law to mankind in general, and ſays, <hi>This do, and thou ſhalt live.</hi> Matt. xxii. 40, compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Luke x. 28. And no one can be actually and perſonally <hi>in the new covenant,</hi> ſo as to be <hi>under law to Chriſt,</hi> till the holy ſpirit puts that law <hi>into his mind, and writes it in his heart.</hi> Jer. xxxi. 33, Heb. viii. 10. And ſays Dr. Owen thereon, <q>let this way ſtand, and the way of man's wiſdom and ſelf-righteouſneſs periſh for ever<note n="†" place="bottom">Owen on the 130th Pſalm, p. <hi>247.</hi>
                  </note>.</q> Every ſoul is wedded to the law of do and live, and is <hi>bound</hi> thereby as much as any wife is to her huſband, till by the work of the ſpirit in the ſoul ſhe is made <hi>dead to that law,</hi> and it to her; and it is <hi>adultery</hi> to pretend to be married to the <hi>living Saviour</hi> in any other way. Rom. vii. 1—12. Many years after the death of Chriſt, the inſpired apoſtle ſaid, <hi>as many
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017083_0020_0F9FC23788B81610"/>as are of the works of the law,</hi> ARE <hi>under the curſe;</hi> from which the only way of deliverance was, and is, by <hi>receiving the promiſe of the ſpirit through faith.</hi> Gal. iii. 10—14. Till then the elect are <hi>ſhut up under the law,</hi> and are <hi>ſlaves</hi> to ſin and guilty fears, <hi>even as others.</hi> Gal. iii. 23 and 4. 1 Eph. ii. 3. This was as really the caſe before the death of Chriſt, as ſince; only then it was taught more obſcurely, now more plainly. The bloody token of circumciſion, was a type of his being cut off for us, and alſo of our being cut off from any <hi>confidence in the fleſh;</hi> which great change is now openly to be declared by being <hi>buried with him in baptiſm.</hi> Rom. ii. 29, and vi. 1—4 Phil. iii. 3. Col. ii. 11, 12. Upon which ſcriptures Mr. Edwards ſays, <q>that baptiſm, by which the primitive converts were <hi>admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> into the church, was uſed as an exhibition and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of their being viſibly <hi>regenerated, dead to ſin, and alive to God.</hi>—The <hi>ſaintſhip, godlineſs and holineſs,</hi> of which, according to ſcripture, profeſſing Chriſtians and viſible ſaints do make a profeſſion, and have a viſibility, is not any religion and virtue that is the reſult of common grace, or moral ſincerity (as it is called) but SAVING GRACE<note n="‡" place="bottom">On a right to ſacraments, p. <hi>20—23.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>mercy-ſeat</hi> was juſt as long and broad as the ark, in which the moral law was kept whole, and into the ſide of which the ceremonial law was put. Exod. xxv. 16—22. Deut. xxxi. 26. Which was an eminent type of Jeſus Chriſt, in whom <hi>mercy and truth have met
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017083_0021_0F9FC238423C0198"/>together.</hi> Pſal. xl. 6—8, and lxxxv. 10, 11. Heb. x. 1—10. Here is our only place to <hi>meet</hi> and <hi>commune</hi> with God, which inſtead of abating, greatly increaſes our obligation to keep all his commandments; only before, the duty was required in order to obtain the bleſſing; but here the bleſſing is given, to enable us to perform the duty. The oldneſs of the letter makes every defect a bar againſt coming; the newneſs of the ſpirit makes the greatneſs of our evils and diſtempers a reaſon why we ſhould come without delay. Pſal. xxv. 11—14. The ark was to be carried upon the prieſt's ſhoulders, according to God's ſpecial direction. Numb. ix. 17—23. And when two prieſts refuſed to be content with the ſupport that his influence procured, and preſumed to take what they pleaſed from the people <hi>by force,</hi> the ark was ſo far from being any defence to them, that they were both <hi>ſlain in one day,</hi> and the ark was taken by the Philiſtines. But it proved ſo terrible, both to them and to their idols, that they put it into a new cart, and left it to the divine influence to carry it back to Iſrael again. 1 Sam. ii. 16, and vi. 7—12. Yet David paid ſo little regard to the right way, that he ſet men to <hi>drive the care</hi> as they judged beſt, till an awful ſtroke from heaven, and divine teaching upon it, brought him into the <hi>due order.</hi> 1 Chron. xiii. 7—10, and xv. 13.

            <p>The goſpel knows of no prieſts in the Chriſtian church, but Jeſus Chriſt, and the ſouls which are built by faith upon him, <hi>by hearing his ſayings and doing them.</hi> This is the church which is the ſalt of the earth, the light of the world, and the <hi>pillar and ground of the truth.</hi> Matt. v. 13, 14, and vii. 24—27. 1 Tim. iii. 15. 1 Pet. ii. 5.

Acts i. 15, vi. 3, xv. 4, xxi. 22.— A biſhop, during the firſt and ſecond century, was a perſon who had the care of one Chriſtian aſſembly, which at that time was, generally ſpeaking, ſmall enough to be contained in a private houſe.

The year after Boſton was planted, a law was made there, to exclude all from a vote in government but communicants in congregational churches. In the year 1636 they appointed a committee, of five rulers and three miniſters, to make a draught of laws, agreeable to the word of God, to be the <q>fundamentals of this Commonwealth;</q> and in the mean time ordered their executive courts, <q>to hear and determine all cauſes, according to the laws now eſtabliſhed, and where there is no law, then as near the laws of God as they can.</q> Two years after they made the firſt law, to ſupport reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious teachers and ordinances by aſſeſſment and diſtreſs, that ever was enacted in New-England.

That their ſkill and courage ſhould now fail them ſo much, that one who ventures to own his name and place of abode, yet ſhould be afraid to name any perſon or community of the accuſed; and he who is ſo bold as to name one of them, yet <hi>petitions</hi> to have his own name concealed, leſt he ſhould be burnt up by them! Will not ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be apt to think, that theſe illiterate, bold itinerating preachers, are ſucceſſors of ſome who lived above ſeventeen hundred years ago, againſt whom like complaints were made? John vii. 47—51, Pſalm ii. 1—4, Acts iv. 5—22, and v. 17—40.—By theſe accounts it appears, that one great difficulty which then laboured among the learned, was a want of agreement among themſelves about thoſe teachers; ſome of them thinking it was not <hi>lawful</hi> to condemn a man, before they had heard him, and knew what he did. Another was, that the accuſers were conſcious that much good was done by the accuſed, ſo that it was a very difficult thing to convince the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people that they were bad men. A third thing was, that what theſe itinerant preachers ſaid and did, laid great <hi>bands</hi> upon themſelves; and when they enquired of their HEAD, by what authority he did it, and how he came by that authority, he quickly brought thoſe <hi>learned</hi> men into ſuch a dilemma upon that point, as they knew not how to get out of, but by pleading their own <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> Matt. xxi. 23—27. This laſt writer againſt us is ſo much miſtaken in thinking to keep out of the fire, by concealing his name, that both of his publications
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:017083_0029_0F9FC241240FF6D0"/>prove him to be now in it; and that <hi>compaſſion</hi> is called for, to <hi>pull him</hi> and his confederates <hi>out of the fire,</hi> if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, <hi>hating the garment ſpotted by the fleſh;</hi> in which condition are all thoſe who <hi>have men's perſons in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe of advantage.</hi> 1 Cor. iii. 11—15. Jude xvi. 22, 23. And that this is his character, is evident; for, ſpeaking of acting upon <hi>ſiniſter views</hi> in religious matters, he ſays, <q>in ſuch inſtances, I know that conſcience would bite like a ſerpent, and ſting like an adder. And, as it is likely there are ſome ſuch cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters among every denomination, for my part I wiſh the law might <hi>be altered to the form</hi> Mr. Buckus has exhibited, or that the Warren Aſſociation would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a form, agreeable to their minds and the third article in our Bill of Rights, which we cannot conſent to have altered, or infringed upon, without violating our conſciences; for we have conſciences, as well as the Baptiſts, and hold theſe rights moſt ſacredly.</q> The form of mine, here referred to, was only to inform ſtrangers in a diſtant town of a plain fact, viz. that ſuch a man, by name, <q>is a baptized member of the firſt Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt church in Middleborough.</q> This is all that was certified by the paſtor of the church, without any other name to it, or its being directed to any place or perſon, which is as different from any certificate ever required by law in this government, as Joſeph's wearing his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his maſter's houſe was from adultery. Yet the two laſt publications againſt me are built entirely upon a ſuppoſition of its being a <hi>legal certificate;</hi> and upon this ſuppoſition it is repreſented in the firſt of them, that either a <hi>new revelation</hi> or <hi>neceſſity</hi> had moved me <q>to diſpenſe with my ſacred promiſes and conſcience;</q> and the writer ſays, <q>I hope his laudable example will be punctually imitated by all others of the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</q> And he ſtill pleads for this, in his laſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017083_0030_0F9FC2421EC774A0"/>as the only way laft for the ſecuring their rights, claimed in the third article, which they hold <q>conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly and ſacredly." And he ſays, "if the practice of giving certificates be really ſuch an intolerable burthen, and unpardonable ſin, why was it for ſo long a time punctually complied with!</q>
            </p>
            <p>In reply to him, I aſk, why the <hi>ſpirit of truth</hi> does not guide us into <hi>all truth at once?</hi> John xvi. 12, 13. When <hi>grace and truth</hi> could be promoted by <hi>circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> Paul complied with it. Acts xvi. 3. But when it came to be contended for, in a way which obſtructed that great and good end, he refuſed to <hi>give place by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, even for an hour, that the truth of the goſpel might remain with the churches;</hi> and he had no mercy to ſhew to <hi>diſſimulation,</hi> no not in Peter himſelf. Gal. ii. 4—14. And the word of truth ſhews, that the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the church, over that evil in him who pretends to be Peter's ſucceſſor, and his followers, will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, viz. <hi>over the beaſt, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name,</hi> which is the number of a MAN. Be it in units, tens or hundreds, it is no more than <hi>man</hi> ſet up in God's place. 2 Theſſ. ii. 3, 4, Rev. xiii. 18, and xv. 2. And that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er now contended for is of that nature, is moſt evident. For in the Boſton Evening-Poſt of May 17, 1773, mention was made of their law to tax all members of the church of England in each town, with others, which the church miniſter, if they had any, was to draw out of the town-treaſury; and then it was ſaid, <q>had the ſame prudent precaution been taken with reſpect to Anabaptiſts, when they were exempted from being tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the maintenance of the miniſters of the churches by law <hi>eſtabliſhed,</hi> thoſe avaricious and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perſons, who get under water to waſh away their miniſters rates, without any expectation or deſire of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:017083_0031_0F9FC242B8690A40"/>waſhing away their ſins, would have little or no tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to declare themſelves Anabaptiſts.</q> This, with other means, brought the Warren Aſſociation, in the fall after, to publiſh theſe five reaſons, why we could not in conſcience obey their certificate laws any longer.

            <p>No anſwer has ever been returned to theſe reaſons, better than railing, impriſonment, and ſpoiling of our goods. If ſaid third article be compared with the amendments which the town of Boſton voted to have made therein, all may ſee that it is the very ſcheme which was publiſhed in 1773, as I have related it. Neither have we any reaſon to think that the country would have adopted it, if Boſton, with her deceitful arts, had not taken the public lead therein. Her chief teachers and lawyers have acted the part in this matter, which we have deſcribed in Matt. xxiii. 3, 4. The winter after the firſt taxing law for miniſters was made, after their ſecond charter was received, an addition thereto was paſſed, wherein it was ſaid, <q>that nothing herein contained is intended, or ſhall be conſtrued to

Matt. iv. 6, 7. And I fully concur, that the following words are very applicable to the preſent ſtate of this country. Jer. xxx. 20, 21. <q>Their congregation ſhall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed before me, <hi>and I will puniſh all that oppreſs them.</hi> And their nobles ſhall be of themſelves, and their governor ſhall proceed from the midſt of them, <hi>and I will cauſe him to draw near, and he ſhall approach unto me; for who is this that engaged his heart to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto me? ſaith the</hi> LORD.</q> Yet this text was taken, with the omiſſion of all the words here put in <hi>italics,</hi> and a very learned and polite election ſermon was delivered from the other part of it, on Oct. 25, 1780, at the <q>commencement of the conſtitution, and inauguration of the new government, by SAMUEL COOPER, D. D.</q> He is miniſter of a church in Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, that is the firſt we know of in this government, who in their firſt conſtitution expreſſed a diſlike at our father's ſtrictneſs, in requiring a credible profeſſion of <hi>ſaving ſaith,</hi> of all perſons that they received to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion at the Lord's table<note n="*" place="bottom">It was conſtituted in <hi>1699.</hi>

<pb n="33" facs="unknown:017083_0033_0F9FC2444A186578"/>this with the addreſs to the people of the compilers of our new conſtitution, to move them to receive it, p. 17; ſay they, "your delegates did not conceive themſelves to be veſted with power to ſet up one denomination of Chriſtians above another; for RELIGION muſt at all times be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter between God and <hi>individuals;</hi>" which is given as the reaſon why they refuſed to exclude out of our future legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature ſuch Roman Catholics as ſhall "diſclaim the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which are ſubverſive of a free government." Yet all the power contended for in their third article is put into the hands of <hi>communities,</hi> who have the <hi>excluſive right</hi> in its exerciſe. Therefore they knew that RELIGION was not the <hi>good</hi> they aimed at therein.</p>
            <p>The firſt founder of the town and colony of Providence Plantations had a plain ſight of the deceitfulneſs of ſuch claims, and contended earneſtly for <hi>impartial liberty</hi> for the conſciences of Papiſts with others, as to matters of worſhip, ſo far as might be conſiſtent with the ſafety of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the rights of individuals; and that none but ſpiritual weapons ſhould be employed againſt meer errors in judgment of any kind. But the fathers of the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts called this liberty "dangerous principles of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Baptiſt hiſtory,</hi> p. <hi>156, 165—171, 297, 298.</hi> His argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then was, that civil rulers can have no right to any more or other power than is fairly given them by the people; and that the people, as ſuch, had no religious power to convey to ruters; all which is now allowed to be truth, though many are trying hard to eſtabliſh a power and practice, entirely of a contrary nature. We deny Mr. Chandler's charges againſt our churches, as to covenant-breaking; and if any perſon or community has done ſo, we ſtand ready to do what we can to rectify it, when it is properly pointed out. Government in church, as ſtate, is founded in compact or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, implied or expreſſed; and they are equally hinding upon officers and privates, to act towards each other according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the compact, as far as their ability and opportunity will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of. And if any one, in a public or a private ſtation, could gain the whole world, by making <hi>ſhipwreck of ſaith and a good conſcience,</hi> he would be an infinite loſer by the bargain. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let no man ever again attempt to deceive others, or give his vote for any who evidently do ſo, as he would eſcape ſuch a ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck himſelf, and alſo the guilt of endangering the community be belongs to thereby.</note>;" and vented all their ſkill and rage, in trying
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:017083_0034_0F9FC244F9662EF0"/>to <hi>divide,</hi> and conquer his little colony; and all the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which by theſe and other means were cauſed therein, have been a prevailing argument for tyranny in the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts; and their tyranny has been a ſtrong argument for the continuance of thoſe diſorders in the other State ever ſince; and how far theſe two parties have now been confederates in trying to cruſh our attempts to remove that tyranny, and thoſe diſorders, I know not.</p>
            <p>Some would have us look to Britain for help againſt theſe oppreſſors; but we have no idea of any ſuch thing. For their king, in a ſpeech to his new parliament, Nov. 2, 1780, exclaims aloud againſt others "boundleſs ambition;" and urges for ſuch preparations and exertions, as, ſays he, "ſhall convince our enemies, that we <hi>will</hi> not ſubmit to receive law from any powers whatſoever." And yet before this ſpeech arrived among us, a declaration was received from his commiſſioners at New-York, which would fain perſuade us, that the Britiſh parliament have received law from America, ſo as to give up more to us than we aſked for before the war; and thereupon they earneſtly invite us to return under their protection, while in the ſame declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they exhort thoſe whom they call <hi>the loyal,</hi> "to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in <hi>their integrity,</hi> for the preſervation of <hi>their religion</hi> and liberties." Compare this with the biſhop of Landaſt's ſermon, and who can put any truſt in ſuch men? Such men as a century ago accuſed Dr. Owen and his friends of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring POPERY, becauſe they refuſed to join in fellowſhip with the church of England, whoſe claims of arbitrary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſoon after brought the nation to the brink of ruin. In anſwer to that accuſation, Dr. Owen obſerved, that all the reformation from popery which any had attained to, was
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:017083_0035_0F9FC24645856808"/>built entirely upon theſe three principles.
<list>
                  <item>1. That the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcriptures are our only rule in religious matters.</item>

            <p>This was emphatically the caſe with New-England, when God was pleaſed remarkably to pour out his ſpirit, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to revive religion therein, forty years ago. This Mr. Edwards, in his book of five parts, very plainly proved. But in anſwer thereto, the next year, Dr. Chauncy laboured hard to prove, that the <hi>itinerant preaching,</hi> which was the chief means of that work, was a thing of very bad and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous tendency, and that the firſt leader therein was guilty of very <hi>raſh and uncharitable judging,</hi> for expreſſing his fears, that many, nay moſt of the teachers in the land, did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally know Jeſus Chriſt; therefore he raked this country, and even ranſacked the church of Rome, for filthy ſtories to caſt upon the inſtruments and ſubjects of that work. And to prove that the miniſters of New-England had not then loſt their character, he produced Dr. Cotton Mather's teſtimony in their favour, who ſaid, "no man becomes a miniſter in our churches, till he firſt be a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant; and no man becomes a communicant, until he hath been <hi>ſeverely</hi> examined about his <hi>regeneration,</hi> as well as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation." But when was it ſo? This teſtimony was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in 1696. But twelve years after, it was openly preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:017083_0036_0F9FC24679252680"/>up, that the Lord's ſupper was a converting ordinance; which doctrine had ſpread through the country before this revival began. And to guard againſt the increaſe of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts in Boſton in 1772, Dr. Chauncy ſaid to the world, "the divinely appointed way, in which perſons <hi>become</hi> members of the viſible church of Chriſt, is utterly inconſiſtent with the ſuppoſition, that, in order to their being, ſo, they muſt be the ſubjects of <hi>ſaving faith,</hi> or judged to be ſo." According to which opinion, the fathers of New-England were the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable men, for ſeverely examining into that matter, as much as the Newlights were for reviving that practice, or the Baptiſts for perſevering therein; and it was an impoſition upon mankind to bring that teſtimony, to uphold a cauſe that was and is contrary thereto.</p>
            <p>TRUTH and MERCY ſhine with equal luſtre, in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kingdom of the Redeemer; and to his <hi>works</hi> of this nature he appeals, as his greateſt <hi>witneſſes</hi> againſt the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of darkneſs. John v. 36, 37. Their united influence convey the <hi>golden oil</hi> into the church, to make her the <hi>light of the world.</hi> Zech. iv. 2—14. Theſe witneſſes have long propheſied in <hi>ſackcloth;</hi> till of late it ſeems as if they had ſcarce any <hi>entrance</hi> into any adminiſtrations of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world, but rather to have <hi>fallen in the ſtreets,</hi> ſo that he that <hi>departeth from evil maketh himſelf a prey.</hi> Iſai. lix. 14, 15. But when the <hi>ſpirit of life from God ſhall enter into them, the kingdoms of this world</hi> will ſoon become <hi>the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his anointed;</hi> and <hi>the ark of his teſtament will be ſeen again.</hi> Rev. xi. 3—19. Then <hi>the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that is upon him, and the words of his mouth, ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from his ſeed for ever.</hi> Iſai. lix. 19—21. The magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate's ſtrate's ſword is to puniſh none but ſuch as work ill to their neighbours. Rom. xiii. 1—10. And when the influence above deſcribed ſhall extend ſo far as to reſtrain thoſe who would <hi>hurt and deſtroy,</hi> the ſword will be entirely laid aſide. Iſai. ii. 2—5, and iv. 5, 6, and xi. 9, 10. Amen; even ſo, come Lord Jeſus.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>SINCE the foregoing pages were printed, I have ſeen a letter from a Baptiſt miniſter in Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, who has lately been drawn into the opinion of the final reſtoration of all creatures to happineſs; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is laid down, as a rule to interpret ſcripture by, that "whatever is to be known of God is <hi>manifeſt within.</hi>" And his ſentiments reſpecting the goſpel he delivers in theſe words, viz. "God in his written word declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as the everlaſting eſſential love: <hi>He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.</hi> If God be love, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically ſo, abſtractedly ſo, he can be nothing elſe; hence it neceſſarily follows, whatever he inflicts upon his creatures muſt have its riſe and ſpring in love and in wiſdom, however ſevere and terrible it may appear to the ſhort-ſighted creature. If in love, it muſt finally, center in <hi>their</hi> happineſs."</p>
            <p>This ſhews the weight of the apoſtle's ſaying, <hi>I am jealous over you with a godly jealouſy; for I have eſpouſed you to one buſhand, that I may preſent you as a chaſte vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to Chriſt. But I fear, leſt by any means, as the ſerpent beguiled Eve through his ſubtilty, ſo your minds ſhould be corrupted from the</hi> SIMPLICITY <hi>that is in Chriſt.</hi> 2 Cor. xi. 2, 3. The tempter's argument with Eve was, that it could not be conſiſtent with <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> to take God's <hi>ſaying</hi> in its literal ſenſe. And to ſet up an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter <hi>within man,</hi> which ſhall conſtrue the <hi>written</hi> word in a ſenſe, that muſt finally center in the happineſs of all
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:017083_0038_0F9FC2481C9857D0"/>creatures, is making a regard <hi>to them</hi> the ultimate end of God's diſpenſations; which is evidently a <hi>changing the truth of God into a lie.</hi> Rom. i. 25. See what is before ſaid thereon, p. 4, 5, 15, 23. Chriſtianity is built upon theſe three points.
<list>
                  <item>1. That God is ſelf-moved in all his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that no higher reaſon can be given for his ſhewing mercy to any, than becauſe <hi>ſo it ſeemed good in his ſight.</hi> Matt. xi. 26. Rom. ix. 8—23, and xi. 33—36.</item>
                  <item>2. That ſin is an infinite evil, and can only be removed by the merits of God the Son, and by the renewing power of God the Holy Spirit.</item>
                  <item>3. That this ſalvation muſt take place upon the ſoul in time, or not at all, p. 15. But myſtery Babylon was built by calling in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then philoſophy, to conſtrue things in the oppoſite way, p. 22, 23. And let it be covered ever ſo artfully, I am bold in it, that to ſuppoſe that God's choice is determined by what he ſees in the creature, and not in himſelf; and to hold ſin to be but a finite evil, and that creature-ſufferings can remove it, is antichriſtianiſm. And the fruits of it always ſhew the propriety of that remark; <hi>he that loveth not his brother whom he hath ſeen, how can be love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi> 1 John, iv. 20. And a temper contrary to equity has ever been diſcovered in all ſorts of men, who have been unwilling to let the <hi>written</hi> laws of Chriſt be their own interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but have ſet up any thing <hi>within man</hi> above them. One candleſtick was an emblem of the church which ſprang from the twelve patriarchs; and two were ſo, of the church that was conſtituted by the miniſtry of the twelve apoſtles, from among both Jews and Gentiles. Zech. iv. 2—14. Eph. ii. 18—20. Rev. xi. 4. This church which is built upon, and governed by, the <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of the <hi>apoſtles</hi> and <hi>prophets,</hi> I believe is intended by the twenty-four <hi>elders,</hi> and its miniſters by the <hi>four beaſts or living creatures,</hi> who unite in high praiſes to God for
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:017083_0039_0F9FC248B54A8C30"/>the diſplays of <hi>redeeming</hi> grace to them, and of righteous judgments towards the impenitent. Ezek. i. 19—21, Rev. iv. 4—11, and v. 9, and vii. 11—14, and xi. 16, 17, and xix. 4. And the diſplays of TRUTH and EQUITY which the Redeemer makes in all theſe <hi>works,</hi> I take to be the <hi>two witneſſes</hi> ſpoken of in Rev. xi. 3—12. And when a full victory ſhall be gained over the beaſt, the church will ſing the ſong of Moſes, lawgiver to the Jewiſh church, and of the Lamb, who is lawgiver to the Chriſtian church. Acts iii. 22, 23. Rev. xv. 2, 3. And what follows, contains a demonſtration of the impoſſibility of uniting truth and equity with the exerciſe of a legiſlative and executive power in civil States, as to the affairs of divine worſhip.</item>

            <p>Accordingly we laid our caſe before the Aſſembly, which met at Watertown, September 20, 1775, to whom we ſaid, "we humbly repreſent that our real grievances are, that we, as well as our fathers, have from time to time been taxed on religious accounts where we are not repreſented, and when we have ſued for our rights, our cauſes have been tried by intereſted judges."
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017083_0041_0F9FC24CE87EF950"/>Which we went on plainly to prove; and toward the cloſe ſaid, "as we are perſuaded that an entire freedom from being taxed by <hi>civil</hi> rulers to <hi>religious</hi> worſhip, is not a mere favour from any man or men in the world, but a right and property granted us by God, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to <hi>ſtand faſt in it;</hi> we have not only the ſame reaſon to refuſe an acknowledgment of ſuch a taxing power here, as America has the taxing power of the Britiſh Parliament; but alſo, according to our preſent light, we ſhould wrong our conſciences, in allowing that power to man, which we believe belongs only to God." This memorial was read at three different times in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and then liberty was granted for one of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren who belonged to it to bring in ſuch a bill as he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have paſſed in our favour. He did ſo, and it was read once, and a time was ſet for a ſecond reading; but when that time came, other things were crowded in, and nothing more was ever done upon it, as we know of. And when the third article, now in queſtion, came to be acted upon in the Convention, thoſe old accuſations, about the deſign of my going to Philadelphia, were again brought up to prejudice the Convention againſt all that the Baptiſt members could ſay for equal liberty. Being well informed of this injuſtice ſoon after, I publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a brief ſtate of the affair on Dec. 2, 1779, wherein I named our accuſers, and challenged them to a fair hearing thereon; but have been denied it to this day. And Lieut. Elijah Ames, as hearty a friend to the American cauſe as any man in Bridgwater, with his brother Joſeph, two baptized members of our church, were impriſoned for a miniſterial tax, on the day that my challenge was printed in Boſton; and two other of my hearers were fined for refuſing to aſſiſt the collector in that iniquitous act. And on March 27, 1780, a cow was taken from Oliver Wetherbee, for a tax to a
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017083_0042_0F9FC24D45434E28"/>miniſter he never had any connexion with; being a baptized member of our ſiſter church in Harvard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he removed into Lancaſter, and ſtill walked in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip therewith. The cow was the property of one of his brethren, who took lawful methods to recover her, and got her into his poſſeſſion; but a band of men came and violently wreſted her from him, and threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>kill</hi> any Baptiſts that ſhould attempt to take her again. But as Worceſter Court gave judgment that the owner ſhould be paid for his cow, Jonathan Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, the collector, aided by Capt. Haſkal, who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore threatened life, ſeized brother Wetherbee on June 26; and though there was no appearance of any deſign to reſcue him, yet he was conducted into Worceſter gaol by a <hi>drawn ſword.</hi> John Hawkes was alſo a bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized member of the ſame church, before he removed into Lancaſter, and had done near four years ſervice in this war; yet he, with Nathan Willard, one of that ſociety, were ſeized on April 11, for taxes to the ſame miniſter, and all three of them were confined at Worceſter till September. And the teachers and lawyers who oppoſe our claims of liberty, diſcovered no more <hi>compaſſion</hi> to them, than the prieſt and levite did to the man who fell among thieves. All civil officers, who received their power in the name of the Kings of Britain, long ſince quitted the exerciſe of it among us; but each of theſe brethren were impriſoned for the ſupport of miniſters who received their pariſh power in that name; and is not this a being <hi>partial in the law?</hi> Mal. ii. 9. Inſtead of <hi>equal</hi> protection, great numbers in our State are now daily expoſed to ſpoiling of goods or impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the ſupport of teachers they never choſe; one of whom is Mr. Eleazer Snow, of Bridgwater, who was baptized in September, 1761, and has walked in fellowſhip with our church ever ſince, being now

            <p>I am not inſenſible of the prejudices of many againſt hearing any thing from me upon theſe matters; therefore I ſhall cloſe at this time with a brief view of the reaſons of the preſent publication. Miniſters have told us that we were initiated into the covenant of grace in infancy; but forty years ago this month, the holy ſpirit took me in hand, and effectually taught me, that I was under the covenant of works, and in Auguſt following he brought me into the covenant of grace, by giving my ſoul ſuch a revelation of the glory and excellency of the way of ſalvation by the Redeemer, as drew my heart gladly to quit all confidence in the fleſh, that I might win Chriſt, and be found in him. Yet I was ſuch a dull ſcholar in his ſchool, that it took thirty-two years to learn me this ſhort leſſon; <hi>one Lord, one faith, one baptiſm.</hi> It was ten years before I came to ſee, that what men call baptiſm, which they have put before faith, is a <hi>nullity;</hi> and it took four more to bring me to refrain from communing with that <hi>nullity</hi> at the Lord's table. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which it coſt the farther diſcipline of eighteen years to learn me ſo much as to treat all laws about worſhip as <hi>nullities,</hi> which come not from the <hi>one Lord.</hi> And his authority upon my conſcience has conſtrained me, to improve what gifts and influence he has been pleaſed to give me, in attempts to propagate this leſſon among my country men, it being the only way to obtain and keep the <hi>unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</hi> Eph. iv. 1—6, xv. 25. The <hi>covenant of circunciſion</hi> gave Iſrael a right to make ſlaves of ſuch as were not in it; and the <hi>taking away</hi> that name which God gave to it (Acts vii. 8) and <hi>adding</hi> a name to it which he never gave, is the very way that the <hi>mother of harlots</hi> has taken
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017083_0044_0F9FC24F4AFE5C90"/>to make <hi>merchandize of ſlaves and ſouls of men.</hi> And the call from HEAVEN is, <hi>Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her ſins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.</hi> Rev. xviii. 4, 5, 13, 20—24. If this call be duly regarded, we are <hi>well able</hi> to overcome every foe, and to go in and poſſeſs' all the bleſſings promiſed in the goſpel. And, as far as I know any thing of my own heart, the only reaſon of this publication is to promote this great good, and to clear my ſoul of <hi>blood guiltineſs,</hi> whether others will hear, or whether they will forbear.</p>
