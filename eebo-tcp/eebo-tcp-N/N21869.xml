            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>DEAR DRUROW</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS you have been my conſtant friend for many years, and have ſome knowledge of the Engliſh tongue, I, in return of friendſhip, intend giving you ſome account of my travels and experience ſince I left Maryland.</p>
            <p>I very fortunately met with captain S—, bound for London, and agreed with him for my paſſage; the next day I went on board, at which time the captain was giving orders to his men to get every thing in readineſs for the firſt fair wind. They had all their cargo on board, and wiſhed for nothing more than a ſpeedy departure. I ſpent that night a very reſtleſs manner, my mind being filled with ſorrow at the thoughts of leaving my friends and native country.</p>
            <p>The next morning the wind-came about, and ſtood W. by N. at which joy appeared in every countenance, except my own. They weighed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and hoiſted ſail with the greateſt expedition —at which time tongue could not expreſs the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent emotions of my heart: ſwarms of thoughts, like theſe, poured in upon me; "I muſt now take
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028801_0004_0FDD4D491E5F0E10"/>
my leave of every thing that is dear to me; I may perhaps be drowned in the ſea, or die in my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and never ſee my friends and native country any more." In anſwer to this, it returned upon my mind, Thoſe I have left behind do not want for any thing; and for my part, I have plenty, and ſhall be independent till I ſee my deareſt friends again. I ſhall be reſpected by our prince, for the diſcoveries I may make in matters acted among the chriſtians.</p>
            <p>But this my friend, was uppermoſt in my mind, to inquire who their God was, how they worſhip him; for you know, our father intirely forbade our Engliſh tutor even to ſpeak of him in our hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Upon theſe conſiderations I was reſolved to baniſh all thoughts that had tended to make me uneaſy, as I did not conceive why a perſon of my ſphere ſhould indulge that ſoftneſs too much practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed among our women. Curioſity now reared its head, and bore the ſceptre with majeſty. I once more caſt my eyes on my native land by way of gratitude, and then took my leave, intreating Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, my father's God, to be my protector, and bring me back, when he thought fit.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of our ſailors were diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the name of chriſtians; but my friend, I was greatly ſurpriſed when I came upon deck. They called upon their God, it is true, but in that noiſy, bluſtering, confuſed manner, as if each feared the roaring of the waves intercepted his addreſſes. I thought within myſelf, their god muſt be but a mean god indeed, if he pays any regard to their wild way of worſhip: but at laſt I underſtood that all their behaviour was an abuſe of his goodneſs, and ſprung merely from a diſorder in themſelves; for they wanted nothing which perſons in their ſituations could wiſh for, and yet, in the midſt of plenty, there was not the leaſt appearance of thankfulneſs. In working the ſhip they often called upon God to damn their eyes, their hands, their feet, &amp; their blood, in ſhort they were more mad with
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028801_0005_0FDD4D4C89BF2DA0"/>
rage than our Indian ſoldiers when cloſely preſſed by the enemy in the field of battle; and ſeeing he did not deſtroy their members, when often intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do ſo, I concluded their god was deaf, or elſe ſo compaſſionate that be pitied and ſpared them for his own goodneſs ſake.</p>
            <p>By attending to their behaviour farther, I found they had another god, with whom they had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter intimacy; he did not appear at that diſtance from them that the former did; and ſome of them I may ſay indeed the greater part of them, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a deſire to dwell with him, for they would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten call upon him to come and take them. This, my friend, was the firſt time I diſcovered that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called chriſtians had two gods.</p>
            <p>Within five weeks we made the ſouth-weſt of Ireland. Our captain had ſome thoughts of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in at one of their ſea ports, to take in freſh water, but the wind being fair, and a ſmart ſea breeze, we reſolved to purſue our courſe. The next day we made the lands of England, at the ſight of which, the ſailors were elated with joy. In three days after we arrived ſafe in in the Downs, where we dropped anchor. I returned thanks to Darus, that he had been mindful of us on the ſea, and ſaved us from the power of the raging waves. After I had paid my paſſage, and given orders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my things on board, I went in the boat with the captain, and that night arrived at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
            <p>I put up at an inn, and promiſed myſelf great pleaſure by being in the chriſtians' capital. I confeſs, my friend, I was greatly ſurprized to ſee the largeneſs of the place, and multitude of inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants: but theſe ſmaller matters I ſhall paſs over till I ſee you; my chief buſineſs is, to find out the God who is ſuppoſed to dwell among the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the manner of their worſhip. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, the next ſabbath day (for you muſt know, my friend, in this chriſtian nation they ſet apart one day from ſeven, for the worſhip of what they call
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028801_0006_0FDD4D4D70BEE990"/>
the true God, and retire from all worldly employs on one of thoſe days) I went with a guide to a place called a church, at the entrance of which I was a little ſurprized at the largeneſs of the company.</p>
            <p>I followed my hoſt till he came to the middle of the place, when I ſaw a tall man covered with a long white garment, from his ſhoulders down to his feet; and, with an audible voice, he read in a large book that lay open before him. Many of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the place had a ſmall book in their hands, and ſometimes they read aloud, in anſwer to the man in the white garment; at other times he and they ſpoke loud together. After this, the tall man put off the long white covering, and then from his ſhoulders down he was blacker than any of us In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, Then he aſcended ſeveral ſteps, and had a ſmall book in his hand, and, as I thought, called upon their God; but in a ſlow, faint, dull manner, quite different from the manner of the chriſtian ſailors. I took particular notice of the aſſembly, ſome of them ſtood, others ſat, and a few were on their knees. In ſhort, I no longer wondered at chriſtians having two gods; for when I obſerved their different poſitions, I was ready to imagine they had near as many gods as they were people; as the different poſition of the body ſhewed differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent frames of their minds.</p>
            <p>Then the man in black made a long pauſe. He again took the book into his hand, for it appeared to me the book was his whole ſupport, and read theſe words:—"What is required of thee, O man, but to do juſtly, love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God?" He told them, in the firſt place, it was every man's duty to endeavour for the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of life, in an honeſt manner; that it was inconſiſtent with the chriſtian's plan for any man to defraud his neighbour; and, in the ſecond place, provided they had more than ſufficient for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it was the ſtrongeſt proof of their being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted chriſtians, and lovers of mercy, ſaid he, to deal your bread to the hungry, to cover the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028801_0007_0FDD4D4F1C4FE8D8"/>
with a garment, as acts of charity and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence are moſt pleaſing in the ſight of God: and, in the third place, to walk humbly with thy God.</p>
            <p>He told them that man was formed out of the duſt, and ere long muſt return to the duſt again; and added, Thoughts of this kind ſhould reduce you to a proper knowledge of yourſelves, and the fruit of it ſhould appear by a conſtant attendance upon the means of grace. When on a dying bed, it will be a comfortable ſupport to your feeble mind, to look back on a well-ſpent life; ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, doubtleſs, God will not diſapprove of in the great day, but will welcome them with a "Come, ye bleſſed, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."</p>
            <p>Mean time I could not help taking notice of the behaviour of the company aſſembled together, ſome of them were whiſpering, others ſleeping, and and abundance looking at each other, as if they were admiring the different colours of their cloaths, or the manner of their dreſs; quite regardleſs of what the man in black was ſpeaking, or at leaſt it appeared ſo to me. After he had done reading in his little book, he came down, and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple went out of the place, many of them walked into the ſame ſtreet where I lodged. So I attended to their behaviour, while paſſing, ſome were talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the news-papers, informing each other how buſineſs was carried on abroad; in ſhort, they were all buſy about the affairs of this life; but not a word did I hear about the ſermon, or the God the man ſpoke of, unleſs in a trifling, profane man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. I was not at all pleaſed either with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the man that ſpoke, or the behaviour of the people, for the former did not tell them who God was, where he was, or how they ſhould find him; and the latter were all confuſion.</p>
            <p>When I came to my lodgings, my mind was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly uneaſy; I rung the bell, and the landlord came to know what I wanted. I told him, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per knowledge of the chriſtian's God: at which
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028801_0008_0FDD4D535A9CC268"/>
he appeared greatly ſurpriſed, and declared he was no ſcholar, therefore he was not a proper perſon to give any information. I then aſked him, whether he knew of any one in the neighbourhood that could. He told me, there was one Dr. T—r. a few doors from him, ſuppoſed to be one of the greateſt ſcholars in the city. The next morning I waited upon this gentleman; and he received me with all the civility imaginable. I aſked pardon for the freedom I had taken, and deſired he would not be ſurpriſed at the ſtrangeneſs of my buſineſs: I then told him I was an Indian, born in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of New-York, and the chief of my buſineſs, in this place, was, in queſt of the chriſtian's God. After a long pauſe, he made this anſwer: Your buſineſs, Sir, is of the greateſt importance; and to give you proper directions, is of equal moment, and requires ſome time for deliberation, If you pleaſe to call upon me to-morrow morning, I ſhall be glad to ſpend an hour or two with you. I did ſo; but the good Doctor deſired to be excuſed, and told me, ſome unexpected buſineſs had fallen in his way, that required his attendance for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days; and added, if you ſtay in town till the latter end of next week, I ſhall be exceedingly glad to ſee you, and give you all the information I am capable of. I thanked him, and ſo we parted. By this time, my friend, I was ready to wiſh myſelf in my native land again, and repented my being ſo troubleſome to myſelf and others. But one day, as I was ſtanding in the paſſage from my room to the kitchen, I ſaw in a dark place the end of a large book it was almoſt buried in lumber and dirt. I aſked the maid what book it was. I do not know indeed ſir, ſaid ſhe, unleſs it is an old bible put there out of the way. She took it into her hands, and opened the cover; It is, ſaid ſhe, ſure enough. Good now, we have no time to read in any good book in this place. Pray ſaid I, is that a book the chriſtians pay any regard to? It is, ſir, ſaid ſhe— I have often heard my mother ſay that every one
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028801_0009_0FDD4D5432E24690"/>
is a good chriſtian who follows the directions giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in that book. I then deſired her to take it to the kitchen, to wipe off the duſt, and bring it to my room. I was never better pleaſed, than when I found it to be the chriſtians rule reſpecting doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine and practice. I reſolved to read it over and over again, and then compare the manners of the chriſtians with what was contained in this book.— I ſpent near three weeks in the reading and ſtudy of it, and found it the moſt pleaſing piece I ever met with; for though I had read over ſome part of it ſeveral times, the matter was ſtill new. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared it to a fountain, of which every paſſenger may freely drink, yet it is ſtill overflowing.</p>
            <p>In this book, there is an account that God is a ſpirit, ſelf-exiſting before all worlds, from eternity to eternity having neither beginning nor end that eve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry good thing either dwells in or proceeds from him. It was he that made the ſun, moon and ſtars, the earth and ſea, and all that therein is: it was he that formed man out of the duſt, and gave him an immortal ſoul that will exiſt parrallel with himſelf. I confeſs, my friend, the reading of this book had ſuch an effect upon my mind, as I never felt before. It treated of the fall of man in his parent Adam, together with the numberleſs evils entailed upon his poſterity in conſequence of the fall; and that thoſe things not only conſume the body, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the mind in this life; but it further aſſerts, that without pardon here, divine vengeance will be poured on the heads of the guilty through all eternity.</p>
            <p>I began to tremble, and the tears guſhed from my eyes in abundance. I laid the book aſide, and began to ſummon all my reaſon to the field, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ſubdue or make a ſtand againſt the confuſion I was in; but all I could do, was not ſufficient to ſtop the rapidity of my thoughts. They recoiled upon me, that Adam was the father of all the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race; Adam diſobeyed the command of his God; upon this diſobedience, his glory left him,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028801_0010_0FDD4D56060C9968"/>
and the curſe took place. I am one of his unhappy offspring: I never knew any thing of pardon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the curſe remains upon me. Upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, nature was conſtrained to melt under a ſupernatural power; I could no more reſtrain my tears, than I could ſtop the courſe of the ſun, or with my word reſtain the flowing of the tide.</p>
            <p>While in this dejected, miſerable condition, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers paſſages I had read were thundering upon my mind, ſuch as theſe: "We have all ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God: the curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked: God is angry with the wicked every day: There is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God: The wicked ſhall be turned into hell," &amp;c. Theſe, put together, were as the ruin of a dreadful breach cruſhing the poor perſon in chains. In this melancholy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I continued ſeveral days; but one evening, while I was muſing on theſe things: it was ſtrongly ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to my mind, "May not the matter contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this book be falſe? Are there not many from the preſs that wholly dwell upon ſuppoſition? others without a ſingle probability for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port? and if this is the caſe, my preſent diſtreſs is without foundation," I took the book into my hand with a deſign, if poſſible, to find out the fallacy, and attended to the matter I read with all the powers of my mind; but within twenty minutes reading I was perfectly ſatisfied this book was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Rock of ages; for it not only militated againſt the practices of the children of men, but Likewiſe the words of their lips; deſcribed and expoſed the abominable thoughts of the heart. I can truly ſay, it traced me from my childhood to mature age, and from that time to this, abundantly more perfectly than I could, if I had kept a journal of my whole life; and when I turned my eyes on my poor fellow-ſinners, I ſaw them painted to the life as completely as myſelf; for although they are diſtinguiſhed as far as I can learn, they have no more regard to the reality of this book, than our
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028801_0011_0FDD4D5A43A87660"/>
poor ſlaves, who have never heard of its being in the world. Reſpecting their manners, they are as vicious as any people I ever was among. I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſome pains to travel thro' every part of the town; but, alas! I unhappily found every ſtreet a ſtanding proof of the curſe levelled upon Adam's rebellious race. There I heard thoſe called chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans blaſpheme the name of God, and loudly call upon him for damnation; others, intoxicated with liquor, were obliged to roll in the dirt, ſhameleſs as the beaſts that periſh; ſome fighting till the blood ſtreamed to the ground. When I returned to my lodgings, I began to reflect on theſe malancholy ſcenes; I opened the chriſtian's book, and found theſe words: "This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, but men love dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil." I opened it again, and fixed my eyes on this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, "Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to deſtruction, and many there are which go in thereat."</p>
            <p>This, my friend, is the melancholy ſtate of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this land, and I fear of moſt other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: I went to one of their churches ſeveral times, but ſeeing the behaviour of the people ſo inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the whole tenor of their book, I could look on it as little better than a ſolemn mockery of God; but the laſt time I was there I took a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice of one of the people who ſat near me: he appeared to be in great diſtreſs of mind, he leaned with his head upon his hand, and his eyes were fixed on the ground, from whence tears flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in abundance: it affected me ſo much the more, as I had laboured under much trouble from the time of my reading the chriſtian's book; and it was ſtrongly impreſſed upon my mind, to inquire into the cauſe of his tears.</p>
            <p>After ſervice was ended, I ſpoke to the man in the tendereſt manner I was capable of; I deſired he would excuſe the freedom of a ſtranger, adding, I <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> his deportment in the church different
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028801_0012_0FDD4D5BB9DE58A8"/>
from all the reſt; and, if it was a fair queſtion, ſhould be glad to know the cauſe. In anſwer to this, he told me, he made no ſecret of his preſent miſery; that it did not ariſe from the want or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of any earthly good; but that the abſence of God was the cauſe of all his troubles: "I have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, ſaid he, under the burden of a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and God only knows where it will end."— By this time we were retired from the confuſed noiſe of paſſengers, to a place more proper for converſing freely with a friend. His laſt words, "the burden of a guilty conſcience, and his fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it would never end," affected my mind much: I deſired him to explain himſelf, aſſuring him, that I had no other motive than a proper information in the particulars before hnted: that I was a ſtranger in this land, and the chief of my buſineſs was in queſt of the chriſtians' God; and told him, that all my endeavours had hitherto been fruitleſs, except the information given me in the bible, which great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alarmed my mind; but I did not underſtand it as I could wiſh, and I wanted ſomebody to explain it. He anſwered, "For my part, I am both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and unfit for the arduous taſk; but if you pleaſe to take a walk with me this evening, you ſhall hear ſome part of it opened and explained in a profitable manner." I conſented ſo to do. But pray, ſaid I what is it you mean by the burden of a guilty conſcience? At which tears ſtood in his eyes, and he thus began:</p>
            <p>"Sixteen years ago, God was pleaſed to open the eyes of my underſtanding by the preaching of the goſpel: I ſaw myſelf a loſt, undone ſinner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt; I was ſenſible that all the flood gates of divine juſtice were ready to burſt upon my guilty head, for my numbereſs tranſgreſſions againſt the King of Kings." Pray ſaid I, is the wrath of God upon all mankind? upon this, and all other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: ſaid he, "We are all by nature children of wrath, until raiſed by the Friend of ſinners from a ſpiritual death to a ſpiritual life; for the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028801_0013_0FDD4D600799FFC8"/>
word of God ſaith, "He that believeth not on the Son, hath not life, but the wrath of God abideth on him." Pray, ſaid I, who is this Friend of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners you ſpeak of? At which queſtion tears ſtood in his eyes: "It is Jeſus Chriſt, the ſaviour of the world (he replied), who died upon the croſs that all who truly believe in him, might not periſh, but have everlaſting life." I was deſirous to hear more of this, but he deſired to return to a recital of paſt experience. "When God, ſaid he, in the riches of his grace, was pleaſed to illuminate my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to inform my judgment, and convert my conſcience, I cried to the Lord for mercy, and he was pleaſed to lend a gracious ear to my ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, ſo that in a ſhort time I had a clear conviction of my acceptance in the Beloved. I knew that God, for Chriſt's ſake, had pardoned all my ſins, and embraced me in his tender arms: for ſome time I walked in the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and trampled beneath my feet the enemies of my ſoul. Oh the happy hours and days that I have enjoyed in ſweet communion with my God!" He then burſt into tears again: "How doth the remembrance of theſe things ſtab my ſoul! I fear theſe bleſſed opportunities are gone for ever; gone from me; I have baniſhed myſelf far from every good; that eternal Sun, which once ſhone upon my ſoul, is now departed, and left me in the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt ſhades of night." As ſoon as he was able to hear my words, I aſked him what was the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his fall? "Oh! Sir, ſaid he, there are more inſtruments for our hurt, than there are ſtars in the heavens, or than drops in the ocean." But, ſaid I, what do you ſuppoſe to be the firſt inſtrument? "My firſt fall, ſaid he, was unfaithfulneſs; this led me to the neglect of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer; quickly after came upon me a trifling ſpirit; then a ſwarm of fooliſh thoughts and evil deſires poured in, like the plagues of Egypt· Thus
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028801_0014_0FDD4D60F0E26F50"/>
I fell from one thing to another, not without a thouſand ſtripes of conſcience, while I was falling; ſo that at preſent I am ſatisfied I have only one ſtep more, that is, from time, into all the miſeries of eternity.' But, ſaid I, can you contrive no means whereby you may appeaſe the wrath of God?</p>
            <p>Suppoſe you endeavour, for the future, to follow all the directions given you in the chriſtians' book Is it not poſſible to regain that happineſs you once enjoyed? "It is as impoſſible, ſaid he, to regain it in point of deſert or merit, as it is to pluck the ſun from the firmament, or diſſolve and make the earth anew: no, my heart, like a corrupt fountain, is poiſoned, and can never ſend forth healing ſtreams: every channel of my ſoul, with every member of my body, is defiled by ſin; ſo that from the crown of the head, to the ſole of the foot, there is not one ſound place, but wounds and bruiſes, and putrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſores." For my part, I could ſay no more on that head, for I felt the experimental part in myſelf, and remember to have read the ſame words in the chriſtians' book. I think I never ſaw a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in greater diſtreſs of mind; and, for my part, I was little better for the recital of his misfortunes, which raiſed in me a deep ſenſe of my miſery.</p>
            <p>When we came to the place where he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed I ſhould hear the word of God preached in a profitable manner, there was a large company aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled together. I was greatly pleaſed with the behavour of the multitude; for, except at the door, ſeriouſneſs ſat on every countenance, as if conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with their own hearts. Soon after this, I ſaw a plain looking man paſs through the crowd, and aſcend a few ſteps above the people: he lifted up his eyes as though his heart was ſtrongly engaged with God; then he ſtood up, and with an audible voice he gave out theſe words:
<q>
                  <l>"Come ſinners, to the goſpel feaſt!</l>
                  <l>Let every ſoul be Jeſu's gueſt."</l>
               </q>
Hundreds of the people, both men and woman, ſang in praiſe to their God. Indeed, my friend, I
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028801_0015_0FDD4D65D689A740"/>
was never more tranſported with muſic than at that time with the ſeriouſneſs that ſat on every coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: the awfulneſs of the place, and the warmth that was in their devotion, all conſpired to charm the human mind.</p>
            <p>After this he ſaid, Let us pray. In the former part of which he made an humble confeſſion of their ſins to God and at the end of every ſentence there was a ſolemn groan: this was done by the whole crowd, as if ſtruggling for a deliverance from the enemies of their ſouls. He then intreated God's mercy, for the ſake of his Son, to deſcend on every heart, and the people cloſed his petetions with a loud Amen, as wreſtling for the bleſſings their ſouls panted after. I ſuppoſe, my friend, in ten minutes time there where thouſands of tears ſhed; and, for my part I was ſo agitated, as if my ſoul were leaving its houſe of clay. It was for ſome time before I could compoſe myſelf. The miniſter, after prayer, made a long pauſe; he then ſaid, In the fourth chapter of Amos and twelfth verſe, were theſe words, "Prepare to meet thy God." He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated ſeveral paſſages to the ſame effect: when he opened the words of text, he told us, in the firſt place, that man by nature was altogether unprepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to meet his God either in death or judgment; being out of Chriſt, God was a conſuming fire. In the ſecond place, he told what was implied in a goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel preparation. Under this head, as a wiſe maſter builder, he laid the glorious foundation, Jeſus Chriſt the rock of ages: that what he had done and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, had made a complete ſatisfaction to all the demands of divine juſtice, and rendered the Father attentive to the feeble prayers of poor ſinners, that we might come with boldneſs to the throne of grace, and obtain grace and mercy to help in time of need; that Chriſt was the foundation on which we might build our happineſs in time and through eternity; and though man had no power in himſelf to help himſelf; he had given his bleſſed Spirit to rouſe the ſleepy conſcience of ſinners, and raiſe the dead to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028801_0016_0FDD4D66F0FDC750"/>
life. To be prepared, ſaid he, is to repent, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake every known ſin, to believe with the heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to righteouſneſs; to receive Chriſt in all his offices, and to preſs after holineſs, without which no man can ſee the Lord. In the third place, he ſhewed the difference, conſequences and miſery, of all thoſe that neglect a preparation; they may expect nothing but the phials of the wrath of God upon their guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty heads whilſt eternal ages roll on: and on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſide, that the righteous ſhall ſhine in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their Father as the ſtars for ever and ever. In the laſt place, he addreſſed himſelf to the conſciences of the people in the ſight of God. Tongue cannot expreſs nor pen deſcribe what I felt. His word pierced my heart, and I was ready to roar in the diſquietude of my ſoul. A little before he concluded, he ſaid, Are there any in this place that ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſinners, that feel the want of Chriſt? My heart anſwered, I do; I know I am undone without his ſaving benefits. He then raiſed his voice, and ſaid, "Behold now is the accepted time, now is the day of ſalvation" The ſilent breathings of my ſoul were, Lord, make it ſo to me; take me into thine arms of mercy, for the ſake of Jeſus. Preſently the ſinner's Friend anſwered for himſelf, Go in peace, and ſin no more.</p>
            <p>Oh my dear Drurow, where ſhall I find words to expreſs what I felt! All my guilt and diſtreſs was entirely removed; and the light of the glory of God, through his well-beloved Son, ſhone into my ſoul: the thunders of God's law, the curſes I read in the Chriſtian's book, and which before daily terrified my mind, were all huſhed into a divine ſilence; and the ſweet promiſes, the charms of the ever glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous goſpel, elevated and captivated my ſoul: the peace of God ſweetly flowing into my heart, like the ſwelling ſtream of jordan overflowing its banks; every mountain and hill was made low, the crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was made ſtrait and rough places made plain. I had a clear ſight, by faith, of the dear Redeemer's ſufferings upon Calvary, bearing my ſins and my
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028801_0017_0FDD4D6AE9BCF790"/>
curſe in his own body on the tree; and from a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſenſe of forgiving love, I could ſay with Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, one of his diſciples, "My Lord, and my God!" O my dear friend, this God is the God I adore: had you but a taſte of the ſweetneſs I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, you would no longer pay any regard to Darus, or any other of the gods of our nation.</p>
            <p>The people amongſt whom I found the precious pearl, are diſtinguiſhed by the name of Methodiſts; and, reſpecting the eſſential points, they are all of one heart and mind, that is, ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through the name of Jeſus, and none other; and, from a deep ſenſe of his goodneſs, are preſſing forward toward the mark of the prize. There is a ſweetneſs in this, different from every other thing in the world. Suppoſing a man in the enjoyment of all the pleaſures, all the profits, or riches together, with all the airy applauſes of mortals, he will come infinitely ſhort of the real happineſs the weakeſt Chriſtian enjoys: they will no more balance the happineſs I feel at preſent. than the ſmalleſt feather the largeſt mountain.</p>
            <p>You are expert in war, and having been obliged to engage with our conſtant enemies; know the ſatisfaction of a complete victory; your mind is elated with joy, whilſt laying the ſpoils of battle at the feet of your friends, and rejoice with them at your ſafe return; but the Chriſtian's conqueſt as far exceeds this, as the great things of eternity exceeds the ſmall things of time; for "we wreſtle not with fleſh and blood, but likewiſe with princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and powers, and wicked ſpirits in high places; yea, the rulers of the darkneſs of this world, and by faith we are more than conquerors, through him that hath loved us."</p>
            <p>I went to the ſame place next ſabbath, where God was pleaſed to ſhine upon my ſoul, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially met with my Chriſtian friend, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted me thither at the firſt; he is now happily reſtored to the divine favor; for he told me under
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028801_0018_0FDD4D6C322B4300"/>
the ſame ſermon God was pleaſed to heal all his backſlidings, and to love him freely.</p>
            <p>I could ſay much more to my friend, but want of time forbids. May the dear Redeemer, who has been gracious to me, faſten theſe conſiderations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my friend's heart, and grant us an happy meeting at his right hand in the great day. I ſhould be glad to hear from you the firſt opportunity. Mean while I remain.</p>
