            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>Thus ſaith the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of by the Houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Prophecies contained in this Chapter may relate to the Deliverance of God's ancient People out of the Babyloniſh Captivity; but then, they doubtleſs look further, and may refer to the Calling of the <hi>Jews;</hi> yea to the flouriſhing State of the whole <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. Here are temporal, but eſpecially ſpiritual Bleſſings promiſed. And it is ſaid that God would do theſe great Things for them in Anſwer to Prayer. God had before put his People in Mind of their own great Unworthineſs, and declar'd that he would not do this for their Sakes, but for his holy Name's Sake: However, he would be enquired of by the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to do it for them. The Words may imply a <hi>Command,</hi> that God required his People to ſeek him for the Accompliſhment of theſe precious Promiſes. They may alſo comprehend in them a <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Promiſe,</hi> that God would put it into their Hearts,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005055_0004_1016925BC938B3D8"/>
and incline them thus to enquire after him. The Word here uſed is obſerved to ſignify their ſeeking and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with all Diligence. The Words may alſo imply that GOD would manifeſt himſelf ready to be found of them†<note n="†" place="bottom">Inveniendum me exhibebo. <hi>Piſcator.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>DOCT. <hi>GOD will be enquired of, and ſought unto by his People, to beſtow the Bleſſings which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them in his Word.</hi>

            <p n="1">I. <hi>GOD hath in his Word promiſed to beſtow all needed Bleſſings upon his People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Bible</hi> we have the great <hi>Charter</hi> of God's Covenant People, in which is contained, and confirmed to the Faithful all thoſe bleſſings, which God is pleas'd of his free Grace, through the Merits of Chriſt, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer upon them, 2 Pet. 1. 3, 4. <hi>According as his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power hath given unto us <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is in the World through Luſt.</hi> That Godlineſs which is taught and preſs'd upon us in the Word, is profitable to all Things, having Promiſe of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come. But the Deſign of our preſent Meeting leads me to ſpeak of ſpiritual Bleſſings, which if we obtain, other Things ſhall
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005055_0005_1016925E6E7518D0"/>
be added, ſo far as God ſhall ſee theſe to be truly Good for his People. And here, I would conſider ſome of the ſpiritual Bleſſings which are promiſed to God's People in this Chapter, for which God declareth he will he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of.—Ver. 25. <hi>Then will I ſprinkle clean Water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean.</hi>—God here aſſureth his People that by his Word and Spirit, He would apply the Virtues of the Blood of Jeſus, that Blood of Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to waſh them from the Guilt and Defilements of Sin. The Blood of Chriſt the then promiſed Meſſiah, is the Blood of Atonement, and it <hi>cleanſeth from all Sin.</hi> ver. 26. <hi>A new Heart alſo will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, and I will take the ſtony Heart out of your Fleſh, and I will give you an Heart of Fleſh.</hi> God here promiſeth that he would ſavingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them, and form in them a new Frame, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Diſpoſition in ſpiritual qualities: He would renew his Image upon them in Knowledge, Righteouſneſs and Holineſs. Thus they ſhould be made new Creatures in a ſpiritual Senſe; old Things ſhould paſs away, and all Things become new. God promiſeth alſo to take away the <hi>ſtony Heart</hi> which was hard and inſenſible, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to yield to good Impreſſions. And in Oppoſition to that evil Heart, God would give a ſoft and tender Heart which like living Fleſh is quick and ſenſible, and ready to yield to the living Soul that animates it. In like Manner God's People being quickned and governed by the Spirit, ſhould be ready to receive Impreſſions from him. Agreeably it follows 27 Ver. <hi>And I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in his Statutes, and ye ſhall keep my Judgments, and do them.</hi> God would not only ſend his Spirit to ſtrive with them; but he would effectually beſtow him upon them, and ſend him to dwell in their Hearts by his ſaving Operations as a renewing ſanctifying and comforting Spirit, by whom God commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth all ſpiritual Bleſſings to his People. And to crown all, God ſays 28 Ver. <hi>And ye ſhall dwell in the Land</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:005055_0006_1016925FFA9DA168"/>
               <hi>that I gave to your Fathers, and ye ſhall be my People, and I will be your God.</hi> God would enable them to diſcharge the Duties of their Covenant-Relation to him, and he would fulfil his Part in giving them the ſure Mercies of the new Covenant; he would bleſs them as their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant God with all ſpiritual Bleſſings in heavenly Things in Chriſt Jeſus. This then is all our Salvation, and ſhould be all our Deſire, even to inherit the great and good Things contained in the Promiſes.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>I proceed to ſhew that God will be enquired of, and ſought unto hy his People, to beſtow theſe promiſed Bleſſings upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may under this Head ſpeak to the following Things. 1. What's implied in our inquiring of God and ſeeking him for the Bleſſings promiſed in his Word. 2. How and after what Manner ſhould we attend this Duty? 3. We may conſider our Obligations thus to enquire of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="1">I. What is implied <hi>in our inquiring of God to beſtow theſe promiſed Bleſſings upon us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. In general, That in the Ways of God's Appointment we ſeek theſe Bleſſings, and wait upon God for them.</p>
            <p>More particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It ſuppoſeth a realiſing Apprehenſion of our Need of theſe Bleſſings, and that God alone is able to beſtow them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men will not be ſolicitous to enquire after that which they imagine they have in Hand, or do not need. When therefore the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> preſum'd that they were rich, and had Need of nothing; our Saviour firſt declared to them, that they were upon ſpiritual Accounts wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked; and then counſels them <hi>to come to him for Gold tried in the Fire,</hi>—Rev. 3. 17, 18. If we are not ſenſible of our ſpiritual Maladies; we ſhall not ſeek after God to cleanſe and heal
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005055_0007_10169261D6787CB8"/>
our Souls. If we are not ſenſible how we are become guilty before God, and obnoxious to his Wrath and Curſe as Tranſgreſſors of the Law; we ſhall not with any due Concern enquire after Chriſt, and ſeek an Intereſt in him as the Lord our <hi>Righteouſneſs:</hi> If we are not ſenſible of our being empty of Grace, and of our Need of it; we ſhall never go to God by Jeſus Chriſt, that of his Fulneſs we may receive and Grace for Grace. Unleſs we ſee and feel our Need of the gracious Influences of the Spirit to renew us, and change our Hearts; we ſhall not in a due Manner aſk this great Gift of God. In a Word, We muſt behold God as the God of all Grace, and Father of Mercies in Chriſt Jeſus; or we ſhall not leave our broken Ciſterns to go to him as the Fountain of living Waters, for all needed Supplies. Agreeably when God was about to invite his People to return to him as their only Saviour, he ſays to them, Hoſea 13. 9. <hi>O Iſrael thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thine Help.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It intends <hi>that we Value and Deſire theſe Bleſſings as the beſt Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Order to our ſearching after any Bleſſing, we muſt have a due Value for it, and Deſires after it excited in us. Prov. 18. 1. <hi>Through Deſire a Man having ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf, ſeeketh and intermedleth with all Wiſdom.</hi> Would we then enquire of God concerning ſpiritual Bleſſings? We muſt count them to be the moſt excellent Things, &amp; accordingly ſearch for them as for hid Treaſures. We muſt eſteem the Promiſes to be exceeding great and precious, and earneſtly deſire the good contained in them. We muſt open our Mouths wide, enlarge our Deſires, that we may be filled. Thus do we ſeek the Lord as our God? We muſt thirſt for him. Pſalm 63. 1 —3. <hi>O God, thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee: my Soul thirſteth for thee, my Fleſh longeth for thee in a dry and thirſty Land, where no Water is: To ſee thy Power and thy Glory, ſo as I have ſeen thee in the Sanctuary. Becauſe thy loving Kindneſs is better than Life.</hi> We muſt count
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005055_0008_101692641EBA3218"/>
all Things but Loſs for the Excellency of the Knowlege of Jeſus Chriſt, and that we may be found in him; or we ſhall not ſeek him in a right Manner. And as the Gift of the Holy Spirit virtually contains all ſpiritual Bleſſings, we muſt value and deſire this above all temporal good Things. That Invitation is made to ſuch. Iſa. 55. 1. <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no Money; come ye, buy and eat, yea, come, buy Wine and Milk without Money, and without Price.</hi> And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is indeed made to them, Matth. 5. 6. <hi>Bleſſed are they which do hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs: for they ſhall be filled.</hi> And without this Value for and Deſire after ſpiritual Bleſſings, we ſhall never ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Theſe Deſires after promiſed Bleſſings muſt be made known to God in fervent Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this ſeems to be in an eſpecial Manner intended when it is ſaid, <hi>For this, I will be enquired of.</hi>—We read of <hi>ſeeking</hi> God, and <hi>enquiring</hi> early after him. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 78. 34. Doth God then ſay to us ſeek ye my Face? Our Hearts ſhould anſwer, thy Face Lord, we will ſeek. Doth God in theſe Promiſes declare that he is ready to communicate the beſt of Bleſſings to his People? We muſt then put them in Suit, and plead them with him. Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near. God is pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf to us in his Word and by his Providence, as the God who heareth Prayer; and he doth great Things for his People in Anſwer to their Prayers. Accordingly our Lord ſays to us, Luke 11. 9. <hi>Aſk, and it ſhall be given you; ſeek, and ye ſhall find: knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you.</hi> We muſt then by Prayer make our Requeſts known to God in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, and thus enquire of the Lord, concerning the Fulfilment of his Promiſes: Theſe are not given to ſuperſede, but to encourage our Prayers. Ver. 36. Context. <hi>I the Lord will do it.</hi> I will yet for this be enquired of.—Prayer is one of the Means

of Grace which God would have his People uſe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in their Cloſets, in their Families, and in the Places of their publick Worſhip; that he may bleſs them as their Covenant-God with all ſpiritual Bleſſings. And in our Attendance on this great Duty, we muſt approve our ſelves the true <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Jacob</hi> who wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Covenant, the <hi>Son of God</hi> in humble Importunity, refuſing to let him go until he had bleſſed him. Then we ſhall find that good Word ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil'd to us. Iſai. 45. 19. <hi>I ſaid not unto the Seed of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Seek ye me in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Enquiring of the Lord may intend <hi>that we conſult the Word of God as to the Way and Manner of our ſeeking the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scriptures are call'd <hi>the Oracles of God.</hi> Rom. 3. 2. They are of infallible Truth, and given for our Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, that we may be furniſhed unto all good Works. And therefore we muſt conſult theſe lively Oracles, if we would enquire of God in a right Manner concerning the Beſtowment of promiſed <hi>Bleſſings.</hi> We muſt ſearch the Scriptures that we may know theſe Promiſes, and how we may obtain a Title to them. This is needful that we may ſeek the Lord ſo as to find him, and Life in the Light of his Countenance. John 5. 14. <hi>And this is the Confidence that we have in him, that if we aſk any Thing according to his Will, he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us.</hi> The Will of God then revealed in his Word muſt be our Rule and Directory, while we thus enquire of the Lord. Thus, are we ſeeking temporal good Things? we muſt obſerve God's Word as to the Manner of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this Duty, and not ſeek them abſolutely as the beſt Things; but only ſo far as may be for the Glory of God, and conſiſtent with our eternal Welfare. But then, when we are ſeeking ſpiritual Bleſſings, as at this Day; We muſt ſeek theſe with our whole Hearts as of abſolute Neceſſity in Order to our glorifying God in this Life, and preparing to enjoy him in Heaven. Matth. 6. 33.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005055_0010_1016926BA65527F8"/>
               <hi>Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs, and all other Things ſhall be added unto you.</hi> Here our <hi>All</hi> lies at Stake, and we muſt accordingly ſeek the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly. While the many and mighty of this World en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, <hi>Who will ſhew us good?</hi> Our great Petition muſt be, <hi>Lord, lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon us.</hi> Now we muſt lie down at the Foot of ſovereign Grace, and ſay, with the deepeſt Humility; Lord, I can't bear a Denial. For we ought not to be willing to periſh in that Place of Torments where the damned curſe God, and die forever. Nor ſhall we ever be thus miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, if we ſeek the Grace of God in Chriſt, and the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, in the firſt and chief Place, with longing Deſires that can't be ſatisfied without them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It intends that <hi>we wait upon God in the Uſe of thoſe Means which he hath appointed for our obtaining the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Bleſſings contain'd in the Promiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſeek this or the other Good, without looking up to God for it, is <hi>profane.</hi> And for Men to ſit ſtill, and ſay, Lord help! without uſing the Means God hath ordain'd; this is <hi>preſumptuous,</hi> and to tempt the Lord. While we therefore pray to God to heal our ſpiritual Maladies, and fill us with his Grace; we muſt alſo be found in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Uſe of all other Means. We muſt attend to read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and take Heed how we hear the Word of God. We muſt meditate on divine Things; conſider their Reality, Importance and Excellency, that we may be quickned to the more earneſt Purſuit of them. In a Word, We muſt wait upon God in all Ways of Duty, that we may receive his Spirit, and ſo his Bleſſing. We muſt ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate, and then to walk in that narrow Way which leads to everlaſting Life.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>How and after what Manner ſhould God's People enquire of him to beſtow promiſed Bleſſings upon them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. 1 <hi>In the Exerciſe of Faith on God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Heb. 11. 6. <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:005055_0011_1016926D4978AEC0"/>
               <hi>to pleaſe him: For he that cometh to God, muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> We muſt by Faith which is the Evidence of Things not ſeen, behold that God who is inviſible, and realiſe his divine Perfections as manifeſted in his Word; his Knowledge, Wiſdom, Power, Goodneſs, Mercy, Truth, Holineſs, &amp;c. And then we muſt remember there is <hi>one Mediator</hi> between God and Men, the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> through whom we have Acceſs unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Accordingly we muſt believe in God and believe alſo in Jeſus Chriſt, that through him our Faith and Hope may be in God. Out of Chriſt God is a conſuming Fire to the apoſtate Children of fallen <hi>Adam;</hi> in him God is the Father of Mercies, and bleſſeth his People with all ſpiritual Bleſſings. We muſt therefore look to Jeſus as the Propitiation for our Sins, and our Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in our Approaches to God. Our Dependance muſt be on the Merits and Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, when we aſk of God the Bleſſings promiſed in his Word. We muſt make Mention of his worthy Name before the Lord, and rely upon it as the only Name, in which we can prevail. John 14.13, 14. <hi>And whatſoever ye ſhall aſk in my Name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye ſhall aſk any Thing in my Name, I will do it.</hi> All the Promiſes of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, they are all confirmed as true and certain; and we muſt accordingly place our Truſt and Confidence in him. As our Lord Jeſus was obedient unto Death that he might purchaſe all ſaving Bleſſings for his People; ſo he ever lives in Heaven to make Interceſſion, and offer the Prayers of the Saints with much Incenſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 3, 4. And the Prayers of his People being thus recommended, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an Anſwer of Peace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt attend this Duty <hi>with an abaſing Senſe of our own great Unworthineſs, and penitent Confeſſion of our Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:005055_0012_1016926FE9EA87A0"/>In this Reſpect we ſhould imitate the Father of the Faithful in his pleading for <hi>Sodom.</hi> Gen. 18. 27. <hi>And Abraham anſwered and ſaid, Behold now, I have taken upon me to ſpeak unto the Lord, which am but Duſt and Aſhes.</hi> He acknowledgeth before the moſt high God that he was formed out of the Duſt, and had deſerved to be conſumed in the Fire of God's Wrath for his own Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities. And thus muſt we lie down in the Duſt before the Lord, when we come to aſk the beſt of Bleſſings; and confeſs with <hi>Jacob,</hi> that we are not worthy of the leaſt of all God's Mercies. We muſt abhor the Self-Conceit of the proud <hi>Phariſee,</hi> who had the vain Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to plead his religious Performances, as if he had made God a Debtor to him by them: And rather with the abaſed <hi>Publican,</hi> ſay, <hi>Lord, be merciful to me a Sinner:</hi> For every one that <hi>exalteth</hi> himſelf, ſhall be <hi>abaſed;</hi> and he that <hi>humbleth</hi> himſelf, ſhall be <hi>exalted.</hi> Luke 18. 14. God reſiſteth the Proud, but giveth Grace to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. We muſt then humble ourſelves before God under a deep Senſe of our ſpiritual Poverty, and be willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe Bleſſings, as the Gifts of free Grace; if we would receive them at all, from that God who hath Mercy on whom he will have Mercy. In this Senſe we may expect that Word ſhall be fulfilled, Luke 1. 53. <hi>He hath filled the Hungry with good Things, and the Rich he hath ſent empty away.</hi> And then, there muſt be a <hi>penitent Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of Sin whereby we have forfeited our Lives, and all our Enjoyments into God's Hand. Now we muſt ſay with <hi>Daniel</hi> when he ſat his Face to ſeek the Lord by Prayer. 9. Chapter 5. Verſe. <hi>We have ſinned and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy Precepts, and from thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> 7. V. <hi>O Lord, Righteouſneſs belongeth unto thee, but unto us Confuſion of Faces, as at this Day.</hi> We muſt mourn with the godly Sorrow which worketh Repentance, upon the Account of our Tranſgreſſions, whereby we have grieved the good Spirit of God, and provoked him to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005055_0013_1016927173672248"/>
depart from us. We muſt with our Prayers offer to God this Day the Sacrifice of a broken Spirit; for <hi>a broken and contrite Heart, God will not deſpiſe.</hi> Thus ſhall we be prepared to receive the ſtrong Conſolations contained in the Promiſes. Matth. 5. 4. <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn: for they ſhall be comforted.</hi> In this Manner did God's ancient People ſeek the Lord, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy may look forward even to Goſpel Times. Jer. 50. 4, 5. <hi>In thoſe Days, and in that Time, ſaith the Lord, the Children of Iſrael ſhall come, they and the Children of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah together, going and weeping: they ſhall go, and ſeek the Lord their God. They ſhall aſk the Way to Zion with their Faces thitherward, ſaying, Come, and let us join our ſelves to the Lord, in a perpetual Covenant that ſhall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We muſt attend this Duty <hi>with holy Importunity, and perſevering Diligence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt heartily and earneſtly engage in this Duty, ſenſible of the great Excellency and Importance of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Bleſſings. Jam. 5. 16. <hi>The effectual fervent Prayer of a righteous Man availeth much.</hi> Thus <hi>Elias</hi> a Man ſubject to like Paſſions as we are, <hi>prayed earneſtly,</hi> and God anſwered him both by with-holding and giving Rain. May we ſeek the Lord with like Fervency, <hi>'till he come, and rain Righteouſneſs upon us!</hi> Our Saviour ſpake a <hi>Parable</hi> to this end, <hi>that Men ought always to pray, and not to faint.</hi> Luke 18. 1. And we have a moſt encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging Example to this Purpoſe in the Woman of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Matth. 15. 22—28. She cried to our Saviour with Regard to her Daughter vexed with a Devil, <hi>Have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, on me, O Lord!</hi> Our Lord appeared to be deaf to her Cries, He <hi>anſwered not a Word.</hi> Then his Diſciples beſought him to ſend her away. And our Lord ſaid, <hi>I am not ſent but unto the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Notwithſtanding this, ſhe came and worſhipped him, ſaying, <hi>Lord, help me.</hi> Our Lord ſeems then not only to give her another Repulſe, but to deny her Requeſt with
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005055_0014_1016927544ABBD60"/>
Diſdain: <hi>It is not meet to take the Children's Bread, and caſt it to Dogs.</hi> Carnal Reaſon would have concluded that this poor Woman had enough now to have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed her with Deſpair of ever finding Relief; but behold! her perſevering Importunity riſeth and groweth ſtronger under theſe Preſſures, and ſhe makes a Plea of this Anſwer in which our Lord ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach her as a Dog; <hi>Truth Lord: yet, the Dogs eat of the Crumbs</hi> which fall from their Maſter's Table. And then our Saviour's Anſwer is moſt gracious, and full of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mercy. V. 28. <hi>Then Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto her, O Woman, great is thy Faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her Daughter was made whole from that very Hour.</hi> And now whereſoever the Goſpel is preached, the humble, and yet brave and bold Importunity of this Woman is told for a Memorial of her, and for our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in Prayer. Let us as true <hi>Iſraelites</hi> go, and do likewiſe; and we ſhall have Power with God, and prevail. Let us pray always with all Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit, watching thereunto with all Perſeverance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We muſt attend this Duty <hi>with thankful Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Bleſſings received.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When God is pleaſed to draw nigh to us in a Way of Grace and Favour, and to give ſpiritual Bleſſings with a liberal Hand; we muſt bleſs his glorious Name which is exalted above all Bleſſing and Praiſe. Pſalm 13. 6. <hi>I will ſing unto the Lord, becauſe he hath dealt bountifully with me.</hi> In an eſpecial Manner ſhould we praiſe the Lord for that unſpeakable Gift of his only begotten Son, and for the great and comprehenſive Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, by whom Application is made of the Redemption purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Jeſus Chriſt. We ſhould bleſs God for the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Effuſions of his Spirit in the firſt Times of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, whereby miraculous Gifts needful for the firſt Propagation of the Goſpel, and abundant Grace were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated: And we ought alſo to praiſe the Lord that
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005055_0015_1016927835599BA8"/>
He has not left us without a Witneſs of his divine Power and Grace in the wonderful Operations of his Spirit in our Times. We are bound in Duty and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to obey that Word. Philip. 4. 6. <hi>Be careful for nothing; but in every Thing by Prayer and Supplication with Thankſgiving, let your Requeſts be made known unto God.</hi> While God's People enquire of him concerning the Beſtowment of promiſed Bleſſings, they muſt not forget to give Thanks.</p>
            <p>Let the redeemed of the Lord then devoutly ſay, <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual Bleſſings in heavenly Places in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. We proceed <hi>to ſhew the Obligations which lie upon God's People thus to enquire of the Lord for the Beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſpiritual Bleſſings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In this Way God's People muſt glorify him as the Author of all ſpiritual Bleſſings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God appears in his Glory when he giveth ſpiritual Bleſſings to his People. In the Works of his Spirit on the Hearts of Men his glorious Power, Wiſdom, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Truth, Holineſs, Grace and Mercy are diſplayed. We muſt pray then that God would in this Way ſhew us his Glory, and proclaim his Name before us. And thus muſt we give him Glory as the <hi>Father of Lights from whom cometh down every good Gift, and every perfect Gift;</hi> and adore him as the God of Salvation. When we thus enquire of the Lord we acknowledge that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are the Inſtruments, the Excellency of the Power whereby Sinners are converted, muſt be of God. Thus we give Glory to the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus, as to the Father of Mercies; to the Son of God as exalted to be a Prince and Saviour, and as having receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gifts for Men; to the Holy Spirit as the Sanctifier and Comforter of his People.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:005055_0016_1016927AEF2371A0"/>2. We muſt attend this Duty <hi>in Obedience to the Will of God</hi> declared in his Word</p>
            <p>Our Lord ſays to his People, <hi>I will for this be enquired of by the Houſe of Iſrael.</hi> God commands his People to pray alway, with all Prayer. And in his Word declareth that we muſt wait on him in the Ways of his Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we may receive ſpiritual Bleſſings, and that abundantly. Iſai. 55. 1—3. <hi>Ho, every one that thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, come to the Waters, and he that hath no Money; come ye, buy and eat, yea, come, buy Wine and Milk without Money, and without Price. Wherefore do ye ſpend your Money for that which is not Bread? and your Labour for that which ſatisfieth not? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your Soul delight itſelf in Fatneſs. Incline your Ear, and come unto me: bear, and your Soul ſhall live, and I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, even the ſure Mercies of David.</hi> And the Commandment is given with a gracious Promiſe annexed to it. Matth. 7. 7. <hi>Aſk, and it ſhall be given you: ſeek, and ye ſhall find: knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It is our Duty <hi>in this Way to declare our high Eſteem for the Bleſſings contained in the Promiſes, and to expreſs our longing Deſires after them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt thus acknowledge that the Promiſes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and precious, and reach after the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of them. Prov. 4. 7. <hi>Wiſdom is the principal Thing, therefore get Wiſdom: and with all thy getting get Underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>We ſtand in abſolute Need of theſe Bleſſings that we may glorify God upon Earth, and prepare to enjoy him forever in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this is the chief End of Man, the great Errand upon which God hath ſent us into the World. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we mind this one Thing needful, we live in vain, and ſhall die without Wiſdom; yea muſt periſh in Hell forever. Alas! We are <hi>all fallen ſhort of the Glory of</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:005055_0017_1016665A138FB0C0"/>
               <hi>God</hi> as Children of apoſtate <hi>Adam,</hi> and unleſs it pleaſe God by his Holy Spirit <hi>to form us to ſhew forth his Praiſe,</hi> we ſhall become Veſſels of Wrath fitted to Deſtruction. Unleſs the Means of Grace are accompanied with the divine Spirit and Bleſſing, they will be the Savour of Death unto Death. We ſhall be like that Ground which bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Thorns and Briers; and ſo is nigh to curſing, whoſe End is to be burned. But if we receive this Bleſſing from God, we ſhall bear that Fruit whereby our <hi>heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is glorified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus ſhall we enjoy the Bleſſings of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Grace in this World, Righteouſneſs and Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt; and be prepared for the Kingdom of Glory.</p>

               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us now apply theſe Things to the Work and Duties of this Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are aſſembled to aſk of God the plentiful Effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Spirit upon his People, more particularly of the Flock who uſually worſhip God in this Place; and to bleſs his Name for ſpiritual Bleſſings already received in the remarkable Revival of his Work among us, and in many other Towns. We are alſo met together to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the Lord that he would preſerve us and his People from every Thing that hath a Tendency to quench his Spirit, and obſtruct the Progreſs and Succeſs of his good Work; that it may go on and proſper, till the whole Land ſhall be filled with the bleſſed Fruits of the Spirit. An important Errand indeed! O that there was a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in us to cry mightily to God for this great Bleſſing; while we humble our ſelves before the Lord for our paſt Unfruitfulneſs, and all thoſe Sins whereby we have grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Spirit of God! We have formerly once and again obſerved ſuch Days of Prayer to ſeek the Lord for ſpiritual Bleſſings, the comprehenſive Sum of which is the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005055_0018_10169281C8272880"/>
                  <hi>Gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And may we not hope that God is now giving a gracious Anſwer to the Supplications which have in this Way been offered to him in Years paſt? And ought not this to encourage us now to pray the more earneſtly? Yes ſurely. <hi>We wait for thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, O Lord, who haſt received Gifts for Men, even for the rebellious; and art pleaſed to ſay unto us, If ye, being evil know how to give good Gifts unto your Children; how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the Spirit to them that aſk him?</hi> Let us then with an high Eſteem of theſe ſpiritual Bleſſings, lift up our Hearts with our Hands to God this Day that he would bleſs us indeed; Bleſs us with the more abundant Effuſions of his Spirit, to convince us more and more of Sin, that Sinners prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Heart may ſay, What ſhall we do? to convert us, that many may be born from above, and ſo enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of God; to carry on his Work in his Children, that they may <hi>grow in Grace, and in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and to <hi>comfort</hi> the Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in <hi>Zion,</hi> that they may rejoice together in the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of God. And let us then all unite in our diligent and prudent Endeavours to promote this Work, each one keeping within his own Line. Let the <hi>Miniſters of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt give themſelves continually to Prayer, and to the Miniſtry of the Word;</hi> that by you God may delight to give his People the Fulneſs of the Bleſſing of the Goſpel, which is <hi>the Miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 8. Let us in the Way of Duty wait upon God that we may be ſtrengthned with all Might, by the Spirit. For who is ſufficient for theſe Things? <hi>Brethren, pray for us, that the Word of the Lord may have free Courſe, and be glorified.</hi> Let us ſeek the promiſed Preſence of our aſcended Saviour, and in the Way of Study and painful Labour depend on him for all that Ability and Skill we need to make us wiſe to win Souls, and lead them unto Chriſt. And let us unite our Endeavours in this great and difficult Work, as Fellow-Helpers to the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005055_0019_10169284B7309210"/>
Truth; that we may promote each other's Uſefulneſs in the right Improvement of thoſe Gifts which our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Head has in various Kinds and Degrees communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to us for the Edification of his Body, the Church. And let the Succeſs which God hath of late given to the Miniſtry of the Word above what we have known in Times paſt, animate us to labour more abundantly. Bleſſed are they that ſow beſide all Waters, when the Spirit is poured from on high. Certainly, it will be an abundant Recompence for all our Pains, if God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be <hi>our Crown of Joy</hi> in the Day of the Lord. I mention theſe Things in Humility, as one ſenſible of my own great Defects in the Work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</p>
               <p>Again, Let <hi>theſe Churches hear what the Spirit ſaith to them</hi> in his Word, and by his Works of Grace. Walk together in the Faith and Order of the Goſpel. Obey that Word, of our Lord. Rev. 2. 5. <hi>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do thy firſt Works.</hi> O that our religious Aſſemblies might be as fruitful Fields which the Lord hath bleſſed, in which the good Seed of the Word plentifully ſown, ſhall take Root, ſpring up, and bear Fruit an hundred Fold! The Lord multiply the Seed ſown, and increaſe the Fruits of your Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Again, Let our <hi>Honoured Rulers</hi> be intreated to give an helping Hand to this Work by your Example and Influence, and by your Authority. God hath put Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon you; Do you then honour him by leading in the great and neceſſary Work of a general Reformation. Be not a Terror to good Works, but to the evil. In vain ſhall we boaſt of the <hi>Chriſtian Name,</hi> if the great Things of the <hi>Moral Law</hi> are counted as a ſtrange Thing among us. Let Judgment run down as Waters, and Righteouſneſs as a mighty Stream. Furthermore,</p>
               <p>Let <hi>Heads of Families</hi> be exhorted to encourage the Work of God by their Prayers, by their Example and

Authority in their Houſes. That God who ſets the Solitary in Families, and builds the Houſe; has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this important Truſt to you with a ſolemn Charge to bring up your Children and all under your Care, in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord. You muſt therefore take up <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s Reſolution. 24th Chap. 15. <hi>As for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> When God promiſeth to pour out the Spirit of Grace and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication upon the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> it is ſaid, that they ſhould look to him whom they had pierced and mourn; yea, that the <hi>Land ſhould mourn, every Family apart—</hi>Zech. 12. 10—13. And then follows the moſt gracious Promiſe of God's open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Fountain to the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to waſh away their Sins. Chap 13. Let Heads of Families then call upon the Name of the Lord in their Houſes, that he may pour out his Spirit on them, and ſo bleſs them in Chriſt Jeſus, in whom all the Families of the Earth are bleſſed. Imitate King <hi>David,</hi> who after he had worſhipped God with his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>returned to bleſs his Houſhold.</hi> 2 Sam. 6. 20. Let our Family-Prayer be in the Morning ſet before God as Incenſe, and the offering up of our Hands as the Evening Sacrifice. Leſt that dreadful Curſe fall upon us and our Houſes. Jer. 10.25. <hi>Pour out thy Fury upon the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that know thee not, and upon the Families that call not on thy Name.</hi> And let us all walk before God in our Houſes with a perfect Heart, and in a perfect Way, ſaying with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>O when wilt thou come unto me?</hi> And then, call upon all under your Roofs to ſeek and ſerve the Lord. Travail in Birth again with your Children, till they are born of the Spirit, and ſo have Chriſt formed in them. And uſe your beſt Endeavours that your Servants may become the Children of God, and Heirs according to the Promiſe, by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt. Let your Children and Servants have Leave to attend the Means of Grace as there may be Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005055_0021_10169288EEDB3570"/>
and the Buſineſs of your Families will allow of it. And in an eſpecial Manner <hi>Remember the Sabbath Day,</hi> to keep it holy in your Dwellings; for the Lord has bleſſed this Day, and hallowed it to be a Day of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating ſpiritual Bleſſings to his People. O wait upon God with your Houſes on the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> and labour for the Meat which endureth to everlaſting Life! And on <hi>others Days,</hi> abide with God in a diligent Attendance upon your particular Calling. Do your own Buſineſs, and let there be no juſt Occaſion for that Complaint. 2 Theſſ. 3. 11. <hi>We hear that there are ſome which walk among you diſorderly, working not at all, but are Buſie-bodies.</hi> The great Evil, of neglecting our own Affairs and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with thoſe Things which do not belong to us, is both the Parent and Nurſe of many ſhameful Vices that have a Tendency to diſhonour God, and grieve his Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Let our Children and young People go to God for the great Bleſſings promiſed in the Goſpel.</hi> Thirſt after theſe living Waters, and plead that Promiſe with God. Iſai. 44. 3. <hi>I will pour Water upon him that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry Ground: I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Bleſſing upon thine Offspring.</hi> Hear the Wiſdom of God ſpeaking to you, Prov. 8. 17. <hi>I love them that love me, and thoſe that ſeek me early ſhall find me.</hi> Hear the Son of God, the eſſential and eternal Wiſdom, Matth. 6. 33. <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs, and all theſe Things ſhall be added unto you.</hi> And to awaken you, Conſider how many of your Age and Time will riſe up in Judgment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you, if you go on walking in the Ways of your Heart, and in the Sight of your Eyes, in this remarkable Day of Grace. Conſider how dreadful it will be for you to be left behind to periſh in your Sins, when others are taken. And look diligently leaſt any of you ſhould fail of the Grace of God, <hi>Leaſt there be a profane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as Eſau,</hi> who for one Morſel of Meat <hi>ſold his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right;</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:005055_0022_1016928BDF9CC9E8"/>
and afterward <hi>when he would have inherited the Bleſſing, he was rejected.</hi> But I hope better Things of many of you, our dear Children. May you imitate <hi>Jacob</hi> in his holy Importunity, and bear away the Bleſſing.</p>
               <p>Or are there <hi>any grown old in Years, and yet ſtanding as barren Trees in God's Vineyard?</hi> Have you ſtood more than ten Times three Years under the Means of Grace, and yet remain dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins? Hear that Word, and tremble. Matth. 3. 10. <hi>The Ax is laid unto the Root of the Trees: Therefore every Tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit, is hewn down, and caſt into the Fire.</hi> Admire the Patience of God, and deſpiſe not the Riches of his Goodneſs, and Long-ſuffering; not knowing that the Goodneſs of God leadeth thee to Repentance. O take Heed leaſt after your Hardneſs and impenitent Heart, you treaſure up Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath! O be ſenſible of the deep Corruption of your Hearts which have reſiſted all the Means God has for ſo long Time uſed with you, and cry to God for the inward and effectual Call of his Spirit; that you may be born again, even when you are old; and that in you Chriſt may ſhew forth all Long-ſuffering, for a Pattern to them which ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after believe on him to Life everlaſting. O remember, it will be a moſt dreadful Thing to go down to Hell after a long and clear Day of Goſpel Grace. To ſuch <hi>is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the Blackneſs of Darkneſs forever.</hi> Do not then grieve and vex the Holy Spirit any longer, but attend to what he ſays in his Word, <hi>To Day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Let ſuch as are under the Convictions of the Spirit, ſeek a ſaving Converſion unto God.</hi> O beware of quenching the Spirit! Now ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate; preſs into the Kingdom of God. Are you made ſenſible of the Plague of your own Hearts? Pray to God, to heal your Souls. Plead that Promiſe, <hi>I will take away the ſtony Heart out of your Fleſh.</hi> Do not
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005055_0023_1016928D6CFGE8F8"/>
And while you continue in the diligent Uſe of the Means of Grace, beware of depending on religious Duties, and outward Reformations. Go weary and heavy laden to Chriſt, that in him you may find Reſt. The Lord draw you to him, the Lord make you willing in the Day of his Power!</p>
               <p>Or <hi>have any obtained Joy in believing.</hi> Adore that God who has Mercy on whom he will have Mercy; and ſay, <hi>not unto us 0 Lord,</hi> not unto us; but to thy Name give Glory. Rejoice with holy Fear, and great Humility.</p>
               <p>And here give me Leave to ſay, If any of you have been preſſed down under uncommon Degrees of Terror, and then been raiſed with proportionable Joys; look to it that the Foundation of your Joy be laid in a graciouſly broken Heart, and a ſincere Cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt upon Goſpel-Terms; and then, that it be followed with a cloſe humble Walk with God, and with Fruits meet for Repentance.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Out-cries, Tremblings,</hi> and <hi>Faintings</hi> which have been experienced in ſome Places, I apprehend the Cauſe muſt be judged of by the Effect. We may not limit the Holy One. The <hi>Jailor came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas.</hi>—They who heard <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Sermon</hi> were <hi>pricked in their Heart,</hi> and ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> and to the reſt of the Apoſtles, Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do? <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. A wounded Spirit who can bear? If ſuch Perſons therefore have an holy Awe of God, a deep Humiliation under the Senſe of Sin, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Concern about Deliverance from it; here is the Finger of God. And if it ſhall pleaſe God to impreſs ſuch a Senſe of Sin, and of his Wrath on Men, that they are forced to cry out under it; they are to be pitied, and proper Means uſed for their Relief; and not to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured as mad and out-ragious. But then, if any would indulge themſelves in theſe Out-cries, eſpecially in Time of publick Worſhip, when there is no real Neceſſity for it, and they might reſtrain themſelves; I think they
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005055_0024_1016928F89E46110"/>
are diſorderly, and do that which has a Tendency to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the quiet attentive hearing of God's Word. Nor may we make a Judgment of a Work whether genuine or no, meerly by ſuch extraordinary Commotions. For there have been Tremblings which have not proceeded from the Spirit of Truth and Holineſs. Let us not then preſume to confine the <hi>free Spirit</hi> of God, but regard the Subſtance of the Work itſelf. I make no Doubt but that in our Congregations many have been deeply wounded for Sin without theſe Out-cries, and that the Convictions have in conſiderable Numbers iſſued in a ſaving Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to God. Nor can I ſuppoſe that it is the Duty of Miniſters to try to excite theſe Schreamings; but rather to ſet the Terrors of the Law and gracious Invitations of the Goſpel before Men in the moſt powerful Manner they are able; and than leave it to the only wiſe God to take his own Way, who can if he pleaſeth order theſe Things to the Awakning of others; as we are informed has been the Caſe, in ſome other Places. Let not ſuch then as have not felt this Degree of Terror, judge them that have; and let not ſuch as have been thus wrought upon, judge them that have not: But let both prove their own Work, and examine by the Word of God whether the Fruits of the Spirit are found in them, ſuch as Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; Love to God, and our Neighbour, Meekneſs, Humility, and the like. If upon an impartial Trial you find theſe Things in you, you will have rejoicing in yourſelves, and not in another. And let not any who have been made ſenſible of their periſhing Condition, and then enabled to ſubmit to Chriſt as their only Saviour, deny the Work of Grace God has wrought in them becauſe they have not felt ſuch a Degree of Terror, and then ſuch rapturous Joys as others may have experienced. But rather be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to wait upon God in the Way of Duty for the Aſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urance and Joy of Faith. And let not your Eye be evil, becauſe God is good. May not God do what he will
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005055_0025_10169295DA8231A0"/>
with his own? Do not then behave as the <hi>elder Son</hi> in the <hi>Parable,</hi> who was angry upon the Account of the Joy expreſſed in his Father's Houſe, when his Prodigal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther returned a true Penitent. There is Joy in Heaven over the Sinner that repenteth; and there muſt be juſt Occaſion for Joy upon Earth, when the Dead are thus made alive, and the loſt are found.</p>
               <p>Again, As to thoſe extraordinary Appearances in <hi>Trances,</hi> and the Things uttered by Perſons that have fallen under them; No Streſs may be laid on theſe Things to determine the preſent or future State of Men. <hi>Secret Things belong to God.</hi> His Word is given us for our Rule. To the Law, and to the Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Let not new Converts imagine that they are called and qualified to be Teachers of God's Word. Are all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets? Are all Teachers?</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 29. No cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, our aſcended Saviour has appointed the Goſpel-Miniſtry, and given to his Church <hi>Paſtors and Teachers.</hi> Nor may any take upon them this Office, who are not called to it according to the Order appointed in God's Word. Let your Zeal then be expreſſed according to Knowledge, and ſound Judgment. It is granted, you may out of the Abundance of your Hearts utter the Praiſes of the great God your Saviour, and with Humility declare what he hath done for your Souls, in proper Time and Place; and edify one another by Chriſtian Conference, and the like. But then, there's a great Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this, and ſetting up for Teachers. And I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that the natural Tendency of this, however God may over-rule it, is to introduce Diſorder, and to bring the Goſpel Miniſtry into Contempt: as if there needed no Study, Gifts and Learning to qualify Men for this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and important Office. The Apoſtle's Rule is that. 1 Tim. 3. 6. <hi>Not a Novice, leaſt being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:005055_0026_101692976699BE90"/>Again, <hi>Let the more private Meetings of Chriſtians be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, &amp; well regulated.</hi> Exerciſe your ſelves in ſuch Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as are proper for you, and let good Hours be obſerved, that Family-Religion and Cloſet-Piety may have their due Proportion of Time. <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerveth, <hi>that to every Thing there is a Seaſon; and that God has made every Thing beautiful in his Time.</hi> Eccl. 3. 1 —11. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, that Duty is like to be performed in the beſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which is done ſeaſonably. There's a Time for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip, a Time for Family and Cloſet Devotion, and a Time for our needful Reſt in the Night, that being refreſhed with Sleep, we may be prepared for the Buſineſs of the Day, when <hi>Man goeth forth to his Labour.</hi> And if for Want of a due Regard to theſe Seaſons, our Families ſhould ſuffer in their Spiritual or Temporal Intereſts, the God of Order will be diſpleaſed with us. I am not now ſpeaking of this or the other extraordinary Caſe, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul continued his Speech until Midnight,</hi> being to depart on the Morrow: But of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Practiſe of Chriſtians in their more private Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. In a Word, <hi>Let all Things be done decently, and in Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Avoid all raſh judging and cenſuring one another,</hi> as Hypocrites and unconverted. For our Lord hath ſaid, <hi>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</hi> Matth. 7. 1. Indeed the Tree is to be known by its Fruits. And we ought to exerciſe ſuch a Judgment of Diſcretion and Charity towards our Neighbour, as to watch over him, and keep our ſelves pure. But then to pronounce concerning Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons profeſſing Godlineſs, without Hereſy or moral Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal openly inconſiſtent with ſuch a Profeſſion, that they are Hypocrites and Phariſees; this is a bold Invaſion of God's Prerogative, who ſearcheth the Heart; and ſays to us, <hi>Judge nothing before the Time.</hi> And for any to utter ſuch Cenſures is a great Injury, and Breach of Chriſtian Charity. And this Sin is aggravated, when ſuch Cenſures are paſſed on Men of publick Character,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005055_0027_101692994DC3D1A8"/>
particularly on the Miniſters of the Goſpel; for hereby not only is their perſonal Character wounded; but alſo, their publick Uſefulneſs may be obſtructed. Let us then avoid this Evil. Rom. 14. 10. <hi>Why doſt thou judge thy Brother? or why doſt thou ſet at nought thy Brother? for we ſhall all ſtand before the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt.</hi> This is not the Way to reclaim Men; but rather to exaſperate them, and ſtir up that Contention which leads to Confuſion, and every evil Work.</p>
               <p>In a Word, Let us be zealous for God, and good Wories; and at the ſame Time beware of the dangerous Extreaty of Enthuſiaſm.</p>
               <p>And thus I have taken Liberty to touch upon ſeveral Things which I apprehend worthy of our ſerious Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration under the preſent Circumſtances, if we would avoid giving the great Adverſary Advantage to blemiſh God's Work; and if we would ſtop the Mouths of Gainſayers. May we reſiſt the Devil, not being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his Devices! May we, in this critical Conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, walk circumſpectly, not as Fools, but as Wiſe! It is my Judgment that the prudent Regulation of our <hi>religious <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> is of great Moment in order to our defending and preſerving the <hi>Work of God,</hi> as we are unworthy Inſtruments in his Hand. And this is what I have ſincerely deſign'd and endeavour'd in the preſent Diſcourſe, &amp; not to reproach any Perſon whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, or to diſcourage any good Work. Let not any then pervert what hath been ſaid to prejudice themſelves or others againſt that <hi>wonderful Work of Grace,</hi> which I verily believe, God has wrought in this Town, and other Places. It is no ſtrange Thing if <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Men are charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with Imprudences and Irregularities. But as for God, <hi>His Work is perfect.</hi> Let us then hear our Lord and Judge, <hi>Wo unto the World becauſe of Offences,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware leaſt we be offended in Chriſt. And let not God's People be alienated from each other becauſe of ſome Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in Judgment. Be valiant for the Truth; and at the ſame Time, follow the Things which make for
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005055_0028_1016929D7401DBA8"/>
Peace, and Things wherewith one may edify another. Let thoſe Words ſink deep into your Hearts. Eph. 4. 29—32. <hi>Let no corrupt Communication proceed out of your Mouth, but that which is good to the Uſe of edifying, that it may miniſter Grace unto the Hearers. And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are ſealed unto the Day of Redemption. Let all Bitterneſs, and Wrath, and Anger and Glamour, and evil-ſpeaking be put away from you, with all Malice. And be kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven you.</hi> And let us all unite in ſeeking the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Chriſt's Kingdom among us. Let us pray that Miniſters and People may have all needed Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Grace to know and attend their Duty in this Day of Viſitation. Let us pray as Pſal. 90. 16, 17. <hi>Let thy Work appear unto thy Servants, and thy Glory unto their Children. And let the Beauty of the Lord our God be upon us: and eſtabliſh thou the Work of our Hands upon us, yea, the Work of our Hands eſtabliſh thou it.</hi> May we be more and more enriched with the Showers of Bleſſing from the third Heaven! May theſe <hi>holy Waters</hi> increaſe and ſpread far and wide, like the Waters in <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>'s <hi>Viſion!</hi> May they be for the quickning, cleanſing, and healing of Sinners; and for the refreſhing of God's Children, and the cauſing them to abound in the Fruits of Righteouſneſs! Thus we ſhall be prepared for the beſt Proſperity. Thus ſhall we obtain Fruits more precious than thoſe which are put forth by Virtue of the Light and Rain of Heaven. God, even our own God, will bleſs us, and we ſhall obtain Salvation from the Light of his Countenance. Ezek. 39.29. <hi>Neither will I hide my Face any more from them: for I have poured out my Spirit upon the Houſe of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord God.</hi>
