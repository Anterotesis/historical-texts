            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>BE IT KNOWN AND MANIFEST to all Perſons whom this doth, ſhall, or may Concern, That on this Twenty-ſecond Day of September, in the Year of our Lord One Thouſand Seven Hundred and Sixty-ſeven, PERSONALLY came and appeared <hi>Gabriel Manigault, John Neuſville, John Chapman, John Gordon, Thomas Shirley,</hi> and <hi>Henry Laurens,</hi> Merchants, dwelling in Charles-Town, in the Province aforeſaid, who being ſeverally and duly ſworn upon the Holy Evangeliſts of Almighty God, made Oath and declared, That on or about the Twenty-ſixth Day of May laſt paſt, there having been divers Complaints among the Merchants in the ſaid Place, of enhanced Fees and Exactions at the Cuſtom-Houſe, ſince the Arrival of <hi>Daniel Moore,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Collector of the Cuſtoms; ſeveral of which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints were founded upon Circumſtances and Facts, within their own Knowledge; and alſo having heard that the ſaid <hi>Daniel Moore,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> had contrary to the Practice of his Predeceſſor in Office, the late <hi>Hector Berenger De Beaufain,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> demanded and received Fees for granting or ſigning Indico Certificates; and further, that he had particularly required and inſiſted upon every decked Boat and Schooner going to any of the neighbouring Rivers and Plantations within this Province, whether loaden or light, to take out Regiſters, and alſo Permits from him the ſaid Collector, as well as to enter into Bond; for which Bond and Permit, a certain Sum of Money was to be paid to the ſaid Collector, and One-third Part of the ſaid Sum to the Comptroller of the Cuſtoms: They the ſaid <hi>Gabriel Manigault, John Neuſville, John Chapman, John Gordon, Thomas Shirley,</hi> and <hi>Henry Laurens,</hi> did then, and at the particular Deſire of a great Majority of the Merchants and Traders in Charles-Town, (and underſtanding at the ſame Time, that it would alſo be particularly agreeable to the Collector to have an Interview and Ecclairciſſement with the Merchants) wait upon him the ſaid Collector at his own Houſe, as a Committee from the Body of Merchants, to Addreſs and Remonſtrate to him, upon the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Complaints abovementioned. At their firſt Viſit, the Collector not being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive them, they the ſaid Committee retired, and waited upon him again, by his own Appointment, the Day following; and then <hi>Gabriel Manigault,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> ſpeaking on Behalf of the Reſt, informed the Collector of the general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of Merchants and Maſters of Veſſels, that the Fees taken at the Cuſtom-Houſe were of late greatly increaſed, and that it had been alſo alledged, that Fees for ſigning Indico Certificates, contrary to Law and Cuſtom, had of late been demanded, and taken by him the ſaid Collector: That the Merchants were very ſorry that there was any ground for Complaint, and that it was their earneſt Wiſh and Deſire, to maintain a right Underſtanding, and to live in Harmony with him the ſaid Collector, as they had heretofore had the Happineſs of in the Time of the late Collector, Mr. <hi>Hector Berenger De Beaufain:</hi> To the firſt Complaint, the Collector replied, that he could not Account for the Advance of Fees in any other Way than the Multiplicity of Bonds and Certificates required by late Acts of Parliament: To the ſecond Complaint, his Anſwer was by no means Satisfactory, INASMUCH as his Apology was only this, That upon a Demand made of Mr. <hi>James Poyas,</hi> by the Collector's Clerk, for a Fee upon an Indico Certificate, which the ſaid Mr. <hi>Poyas</hi> had paid, but murmured at it, as being an Exaction, the Collector had called to him as he was going out of the Cuſtom-Houſe, and ſaid, "don't pay it Mr. <hi>Poyas,</hi> don't pay it;" whereas it was remarked to the Collector, that if inſtead of calling to Mr. <hi>Poyas</hi> not to pay the Fee, he had forbid his Clerk to receive it, and Chid him for his Preſumption, that would have been more effectual. FURTHER the ſaid Committee ſay, That in order to be explicit with the Collector, in one other Inſtance of what they apprehended to be an Exaction of Fees, and which was mentioned by Mr. <hi>Henry Laurens,</hi> in the Caſe of the Ship <hi>Anne, George
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010748_0003_0F81745EB8891D30"/>
Forten,</hi> Maſter, of which the ſaid <hi>Laurens</hi> was One-fourth Owner, cleared out a few Days before, for which Ship no leſs than <hi>Fourteen Pounds</hi> had been paid to the Collector only; whereas in ſimilar Caſes, while Mr. <hi>Beaufain</hi> was Collector, no more than <hi>Eight,</hi> or <hi>Eight Pounds Ten Shillings</hi> was wont to be paid: To which the Collector replied, That if Mr. <hi>Laurens</hi> would ſend Captain <hi>Forten</hi> next Day, with all his Papers, that he the Collector would examine into that Affair, and by a particular Account of the Fees, give Satisfaction, that no more had been taken than was really due; but if it ſhould appear otherwiſe, he would make a Return. The COMMITTEE being ſatisfied with the Equity of this Propoſal, reſted upon the Aſſurances of the Collector, and ſoon after retired from him.</p>
            <p>THE ſaid <hi>Gabriel Manigault, John Neuſville, John Chapman, John Gordon, Thomas Shirley,</hi> and <hi>Henry Laurens,</hi> each for himſelf, doth ſeverally and reſpectively declare, That it was always his Wiſh and earneſt Deſire, to live in Peace with the ſaid Collector, and to have paid to him upon every Occaſion that ſhould occur, his full and juſt Fees, according to Cuſtom, and agreeable to any Law, and all the Laws relative to the American Trade, paſſed ſince the Deceaſe of the late Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector, <hi>Hector Berenger De Beaufain,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> That he and they ſeverally and reſpectively never had any Deſign, Intention or Wiſh, to curtail ſuch due Fees, or to impede or obſtruct in any Degree, the ſaid Collector, in the due, full, and legal Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Office as Collector of the Cuſtoms: And that to the beſt of their Knowledge and Belief, jointly and ſeverally, every Merchant in Charles-Town, was, in like Manner, favourably diſpoſed towards the Collector, and heartily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to pay Obedience to Acts of the Britiſh Parliament.</p>

            <p>BE IT KNOWN AND MANIFEST to all Perſons whom this doth, ſhall, or may Concern, That on this Twenty-eighth Day of September, in the Year of our Lord One Thouſand Seven Hundred and Sixty-ſeven, PERSONALLY came and appeared <hi>Henry Laurens,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of the Committee of the Merchants, and others, Traders in Charles-Town, and who hath been a Britiſh Merchant TWENTY-THREE YEARS; who being duly ſworn upon the Holy Evangeliſts of Almighty God, maketh Oath and declares, That the Collector <hi>Daniel Moore,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> often endeavoured to perſuade him the Deponent, that there was a Neceſſity for every Coaſting Schooner or Schooners that paſſed Fort <hi>Johnſon,</hi> to enter into Bond to him the Collector, and take out a Permit for Six Months; that there was no Medium between regularly entering and clearing ſuch Schooners, although in Ballaſt, and only going to ſome of the neighbouring Plantations every Voyage, and taking ſuch Certificates as he propoſed; that if they did not comply with one or other, Seizure and Forfeiture muſt inevitably follow; and therefore he deſired the ſaid <hi>Henry Laurens</hi> to uſe his Influence with other the principal Merchants, that they might comply with his, the Collector's Propoſition; adding, that ſeveral low Perſons had offered to take ſuch Permits, but that he choſe to begin at the other End, or with other Sort of People; to which the ſaid <hi>Henry Laurens</hi> replied in general, that he by no means thought it improper that ſome Part of the Coaſting Trade ſhould be under due Regulation; but that in the extenſive Manner that the Collector required, it would
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010748_0003_0F81745EB8891D30"/>
Diſtreſs the Province in general; that it would be impoſſible to comply with it, and that it would anſwer no good End to the Public; and beſides, that if the Collector's Permits were to guard them effectually againſt Seizures from the Cuſtom-Houſe Officers on board of his Majeſty's Ships, he the Deponent was of Opinion that ſuch Permits might have a dangerous Tendency, and be made a Cloak for illicit and irregular Trade; but that nevertheleſs, if there was any Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment obliging ſuch ſmall Veſſels to take Certificates, he ſhould for his own Part, pay due Obedience to it as far as poſſible, and ſhould alſo recommend the ſame to his Friends. The Collector aſſured the Deponent, that it was in his Power to compel all ſuch Veſſels to enter and clear every Trip they made to and from the Plantations: To which the Deponent replied, that he believed the Collector might by an Extenſion of his Power, create a great deal of Trouble to the People in Carolina, but that he was likewiſe certain, the Collector might alſo avoid giving them ſuch Trouble, and yet not relax from his Duty; and that in his Opinion a mere Exertion of Power would finally be attended with no real Service to the King, nor was it to be ſet in Competition with the Affections of a whole Province, or Words to that Effect: And about the ſame Time the Deponent aſked the Collector to favour him with a Sight of any Act of Parliament from whence he derived ſuch Power and Authority, and alſo to inform him what Price or Fee he would demand for ſuch Half yearly Certificates: The Deponent has forgot what Anſwer the Collector gave to the firſt Queſtion, but he knows that the Collector never ſhewed him his Authority by Law, in Support of his Demand: But to the ſecond, the Collector aſked him what he thought of <hi>Half a Guinea</hi> for the Bond and Certificate; this Deponent anſwered, that if the Caſe was really as the Collector had repreſented to him, he thought the Collector's Demand was rather Indulgent. This Deponent further declares, that on the ſame Day, he heard the Honourable <hi>John Drayton,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and his Son <hi>William Henry Drayton,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> ſeverally aſk the Collector what was to be the Fee for ſuch Bond and Certificate; and that the Collector replied to one <hi>Three Pounds Fifteen Shillings</hi> Current Money, and to the other <hi>Seven Pounds</hi> Current Money: That about the ſame Time he was informed by <hi>John Wragg,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> that the Collector had demanded of him an <hi>Engliſh Guinea</hi> for ſuch Bond and Certificate; and he was alſo further informed, and hath ſince found it to be true, that the Collector had granted ſeveral of his Certificates at various Prices, ſome at <hi>Thirty Shillings,</hi> ſome at <hi>Forty Shillings</hi> Currency, and ſo forth: That upon hearing the Collector himſelf vary ſo much in his Demand, and alſo his declining or omitting to ſhew this Deponent his Authority, derived from any Statute or Act of Parliament, as well as doubting the Legality of his Permits to paſs Fort <hi>Johnſon,</hi> he thought and ſaid, that the Collector did not Tread upon firm Ground, and therefore doubted whether he had any Authority for the Demands which he had made: And the ſaid <hi>Henry Laurens</hi> alſo declareth, that about that Time, while he was further converſing with the Collector on the Subject above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned in the Cuſtom-Houſe, the Collector informed him that Captain <hi>Hawker,</hi> of his Majeſty's Sloop <hi>Sardcine,</hi> had ſiezed one of the Coaſting Schooners belonging to this Province; adding, that if he was to join Captain <hi>Hawker,</hi> in an Information or Proſecution againſt the ſaid Schooner, ſhe would certainly be condemned as forfeited; to which this Deponent replied, that he hoped then that HE the Collector would not join Captain <hi>Hawker,</hi> becauſe if there was any Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, it muſt have been the Effect of Inadvertence and Ignorance, ſince it was evident no Fraud was deſigned, as the Veſſel had actually come into this Port or Harbour, under the immediate View of the Cuſtom-Houſe Officers; the Collector anſwered no, by no Means would he join Captain <hi>Hawker</hi>; but at the ſame Time adviſed the Deponent very earneſtly, to ſpeak to other Merchants, and to comply with his forementioned Propoſition and Demand, which he added would be their only, or beſt Way, and then ſaid he, your Veſſels may ſail in Safety.</p>
            <p>THIS Deponent further declareth, That in Conſequence of the Invitation or Permiſſion given by the Collector, he directed <hi>George Forten,</hi> Maſter of the Ship <hi>Anne,</hi> together with <hi>John Hopton,</hi> Clerk to this Deponent, to wait upon the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector at the Cuſtom-Houſe, with all his Papers received at the Cuſtom-Houſe, at the clearing out the ſaid Ship, in order to obtain a particular Account of the ſeveral Items, making up the ſaid Sum of <hi>Fourteen Pounds.</hi> And that the ſaid <hi>George

Forten,</hi> and <hi>John Hopton,</hi> did accordingly attend the Collector at the Cuſtom-Houſe; from whence being returned, they informed this Deponent that the Collector had received them very angrily, and ſaid, that as the Merchants were ſo exact with him, he would be ſo to them, and that not one Indulgence ſhould be granted to them after that Time; and that he the Collector then produced an Account of his Fees for the ſaid Ship <hi>Anne,</hi> which amounted to <hi>Fourteen Pounds Two Shillings and Six-pence</hi>; that he demanded immediate Payment of the additional <hi>Two Shillings and Six-pence,</hi> Carolina Currency, and declared that not one of the Ship's Papers ſhould go out of the Office until the ſame was paid: That they attempted to expoſtulate upon this new Account, in order to ſhew certain Over-charges therein; but that the Collector would not hear them, but very wrathfully diſmiſſed them, ſaying he would not loſe his Time in Diſputes: Which ſeveral Particulars will appear more at large in a Proteſt made by the ſaid <hi>George Forten, John Hopton,</hi> and <hi>Henry Laurens,</hi> on the firſt of June, 1767, and is hereunto annexed. [<hi>Vide No.</hi> 1] And the ſaid <hi>Henry Laurens</hi> further ſaith, That notwithſtanding the Behaviour of the ſaid <hi>Daniel Moore,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> as laſt abovementioned, ſo contrary to his Promiſes made to the Committee of Merchants, as well as to himſelf in particular; and notwithſtanding his own Conviction, that the Collector had exacted Fees more than was due to him in that Caſe abovementioned, by inſerting ſome Charges that were Fictions, as well as by a Duplicity of others; yet willing as much as in him lay, to preſerve Harmony, and keep up a good Underſtanding with the Collector, and alſo to ſhew all poſſible Reſpect to one of his Majeſty's Officers, in ſo high a Rank as the Collector of the Cuſtoms, he went on the Day following, (to wit, the 29th of May) to the Cuſtom-Houſe, and there addreſſed the Collector in reſpectful Terms, and deſired to Remonſtrate upon the Subject of the Charges abovementioned; that the Collector went towards his Deſk as if he meant to examine into the ſaid Complaint, but ſuddenly turned about, and in ſome Warmth, ſaid it was an Holyday, that he was buſy, and ſhould be more ſo preſently: Whereupon the Deponent anſwered, that he ſaw the Cuſtom-Houſe open, and therefore came in, not merely to aſk a Favour, but to apply for Redreſs in a Matter wherein he thought himſelf aggrieved, and that he now requeſted the Collector to inform him whether he would grant him ſuch Redreſs or not: The Collector then deſired him to defer the Buſineſs until the Saturday Afternoon following, and then if the Deponent would attend him at the Cuſtom-Houſe, he would Retroſpect the Account aforementioned: And the ſaid <hi>Henry Laurens</hi> further ſaith, That having other Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to tranſact at the Cuſtom-Houſe, he went there on Saturday Morning, and that the Collector then told him he need not be at the Trouble of coming in the Afternoon according to Appointment, for he determined to return no Part of the Fees taken for clearing out the Ship <hi>Anne,</hi> and that he took that as an Opportunity to inform the Deponent; whereupon the ſaid <hi>Henry Laurens</hi> thinking himſelf greatly injured, and oppreſſed by the ſaid Collector, cauſed the Proteſt before referred to, to be extended on Behalf of himſelf and others, Owners of the ſaid Ship <hi>Anne,</hi> (to wit, on the firſt of June, 1767). And the ſaid <hi>Henry Laurens</hi> further ſaith, That ſome Days after the ſaid Proteſt was made, <hi>Miles Brewton,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a great Number of principal Merchants in Charles-Town, declared unto the ſaid <hi>Henry Laurens,</hi> that he was authorized by the Collector to inform him, that he had further conſidered the Fees taken on the Ship <hi>Anne,</hi> and was convinced that they were too high by <hi>Forty Shillings</hi>; which <hi>Forty Shillings</hi> Mr. <hi>Laurens</hi> might receive whenever he would call for it: To which the ſaid <hi>Henry Laurens</hi> anſwered, that he thought the Fees were too high by <hi>Four Pounds Ten Shillings</hi> at leaſt, but that he was not contending for <hi>Forty Shillings,</hi> but for Right and Juſtice to the whole Trade, and therein as he conceived, to the whole Province; nevertheleſs, as he always preferred moderate Meaſures, if Mr. <hi>Brewton</hi> would promiſe that the Collector would make Reſtitution to other People who were in like Manner aggrieved, and alſo forbear to exact more Fees than were due to him in future, he the Deponent ſhould take no further Notice of what had happened between the Collector and himſelf; but Mr. <hi>Brewton</hi> would not engage ſo extenſively, not being thereunto authorized by the Collector: And the ſaid <hi>Henry Laurens</hi> declares, that he has never ſince received, nor hath any offer been made to him, either of the <hi>Forty Shillings,</hi> or any other Sum by way of Reſtitution, in the Caſe aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.

The ſaid Deponent further declareth, That on or about the Twenty-ninth Day of May laſt, he went to the Cuſtom-Houſe in order to clear out his Schooner <hi>W<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

And the Deponent further ſaith, That notwithſtanding the ſaid Collector had declined to take a Bond from him for Non-enumerated Goods on board the ſaid Schooner <hi>Wambaw,</hi> at her Departure from Charles-Town, which tended to miſlead and inſnare the ſaid <hi>Henry Laurens</hi>; and even to endanger his Schooner to Seizure, before and after her Departure from Charles-Town: That notwithſtanding the Declaration made by the Deponent, that there was no Cuſtom-Houſe nor Officers at the Port or Place to which his Schooner was bound, and from whence ſhe was to return; which FACT the Collector has admitted and acknowledged upon Oath, in the Court of Vice-Admiralty: And alſo notwithſtanding the fair, candid, and open Procedure of the ſaid <hi>Henry Laurens,</hi> and his Endeavours to comply with the Modes and Forms of Law, as far as the Nature of the Caſe would admit of; and that no Fraud or illicit Trade had been carried on or attempted by the ſaid Schooner <hi>Wambaw,</hi> yet the ſaid Collector refuſed to admit the ſaid Schooner to an Entry, unleſs two particular Friends of the ſaid <hi>Henry Laurens,</hi> (in his Abſence) ſhould go to the Cuſtom-Houſe, and there in Perſon, aſk it as a great Favour; which Fact is well atteſted upon Record in the Court of Vice-Admiralty: And finally, becauſe the ſaid Perſons declined or omitted to aſk ſuch Favour in the Way and Manner that he required, he gave Orders and cauſed the ſaid Schooner <hi>Wambaw</hi> to be ſeized and libeled in the Court of Vice-Admiralty, where the ſaid Schooner <hi>Wambaw</hi> hath ſince been condemned as forfeited.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:010748_0005_0F817460F6F7BF30"/>AND the ſaid <hi>Henry Laurens</hi> declareth, that on or about the Seventeenth of June laſt, he went to the Cuſtom-Houſe with <hi>Peter Bachop,</hi> Maſter of another Schooner belonging to the Deponent, called the <hi>Broughton-Iſland Packet,</hi> in order to clear out the ſaid Schooner for the ſame Plantation, with Proviſions, Bricks, and a few other Neceſſaries for the Uſe of his ſaid Plantation, exactly in the ſame Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as the laſt mentioned Schooner <hi>Wambaw</hi>; and that the ſame Maſter tendered a Manifeſt, ſetting forth the Proviſion and other Articles on board, and that the Veſſel was bound to <hi>Broughton-Iſland</hi> in the River <hi>Alatamaha,</hi> where there was no Port of Entry, or Cuſtom-Houſe, and from whence no Certificate could be returned. That the ſaid <hi>Daniel Moore</hi> took up the Manifeſt, and without Preface or Reaſon aſſigned, inſulted him the Deponent, alledging, that he could make his Plantation to be in <hi>Georgia</hi> or <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> as it ſhould ſuit beſt his Purpoſe: The Deponent conſcious of the Injuſtice of ſuch a Charge, inaſmuch as the Locality of the ſaid Plantation had been declared upon Oath before the Collector, at clearing out the Schooner <hi>Wambaw</hi> Twenty-one Days before; replied in general, that he knew where he was, in the King's Cuſtom-Houſe; that he paid all Obedience to his Majeſty, and due Reſpect to his Officers; but as to the Collector, as Mr. <hi>Moore,</hi> he heartily deſpiſed him, and that he had heard his Fame Twenty-five Years ago; that if he had preſumed ſo to inſult the Deponent in any other Place, he ſhould have given him another, or proper Anſwer; that the Cuſtom-Houſe was not a Place for Quarrels, and therefore prayed that his Buſineſs might be diſpatched, and he permitted to retire: But the Collector continued indiſcreetly to Wrangle and Clamour at the Deponent, and at length called the Deponent aſide in the Cuſtom-Houſe, and there gave him a formal Challenge, to fight at ſome Place in the Province of <hi>Georgia,</hi> which the Collector promiſed to appoint, and give him Notice of in writing; but the Deponent doth not charge the Collector with having ſent him ſuch Notice, as he never did receive any ſuch.</p>
            <p>AND this Deponent further ſaith, That after the ſaid Schooner was cleared out, ſhe proceeded to the ſaid Plantation, and there delivered the Cargo before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; then took Ballaſt of Wood on board for want of Sand or Stones as aforeſaid, and returned to Charles-Town immediately, where he applied to enter the ſaid Veſſel by Manifeſt, declaring that ſhe was in Ballaſt only, having no Goods on board for Sale or Merchandize, and that ſhe came from a Place where there was no Port of Entry, nor Cuſtom-Houſe Officers within many Miles; but the Collector refuſed to admit the Veſſel, cauſed her to be ſeized, and libeled in the Court of Vice-Admiralty, in which Court the ſaid Veſſel has been acquitted, and Coſts decreed againſt the Proſecutor: Yet nevertheleſs, the Deponent hath been put to very great Charges, Trouble, and loſs of Time thereby.

            <p>BE IT KNOWN AND MANIFEST to all Perſons whom this doth, ſhall, or may Concern, That on this Twenty-third Day of September, in the Year of our Lord One Thouſand Seven Hundred and Sixty-ſeven, PERSONALLY came and appeared <hi>John Edwards,</hi> of Charles-Town, Merchant, and who hath been Reſident there for FIFTEEN YEARS laſt paſt, who being duly ſworn upon the Holy Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts of Almighty God, maketh Oath and declares, That on or about the Eleventh Day of June laſt paſt, he applied at the Cuſtom-Houſe for five Certificates for bondable Goods landed in Charles-Town from Great-Britain; that in Conſequence thereof, after comparing the Marks and Numbers of the Packages of the ſaid Goods, the Certificates were made out, and ſigned by <hi>Daniel Moore,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the Collector, and delivered to the Deputy-Comptroller, to be ſigned by him: The Deponent then aſked the Collector what was the Charge for ſaid Certificates, and was referred by him to his Clerk. The Clerk informed him <hi>Ten Shillings</hi> each Certificate, which the Deponent was proceeding to pay, but the Clerk added, that he muſt alſo pay for ſearching the Cockets; to which the Deponent replied, that he imagined he the Clerk had no right to make him pay for that; whereupon the Collector, <hi>Daniel Moore,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> without ſaying one Word, came in a Paſſion from a diſtant Part of the Room, took up the five Certificates, tore them in Pieces, and told the Deponent that he ſhould go and procure a Certificate from the Searchers before he would grant him any Certificates, and that he might ſeek his Remedy where he pleaſed. The ſaid <hi>John Edwards</hi> further ſaith, That on the Twelfth Day of June laſt paſt, he went to the Cuſtom-Houſe to clear the Ship <hi>Fair American, John Minſhall,</hi> Maſter, for <hi>Liverpool</hi>; that the Collector obſerving one Pipe of Wine inſerted in the Manifeſt; he aſked if the King's Duty was paid for it, and was anſwered that it was imported by Meſſrs. <hi>Brailsford</hi> and <hi>Chapman,</hi> of Charles-Town, Merchants, and the Duty ſecured; which was confirmed by Mr. <hi>Hatley,</hi> the Collector's Clerk, who aſſured him, more than once, that the Duty was ſecured; nevertheleſs, the Collector (merely as the Deponent believes, to impede his Buſineſs and to put him to Trouble) refuſed to clear the Ship before Meſſrs. <hi>Brailsford</hi> and <hi>Chapman</hi> were ſent for to pay the ſaid Duty. Whereupon Mr. <hi>Edward Blake,</hi> a Merchant in Charles-Town, being preſent, went to call the ſaid <hi>Brailsford</hi> and <hi>Chapman,</hi> or one of them; and Mr. <hi>Chapman</hi> came, and complained that the Collector ſo much doubted their Credit, as to refuſe clearing a Ship on Account of the Duty upon a ſingle Pipe of Wine, when the Duty of the whole Cargo, and of which that was Part, was ſecured by their Note; and added, that he had brought Money with him to pay the ſaid Note:—That the Collector denied that he had refuſed to clear the Ship on that Account.—The Fact being ſo plain, the Deponent, and the ſaid Maſter, <hi>John Minſhall,</hi> being detained upon that Account only, and the Deponent's Veracity queſtioned; he the Deponent did modeſtly aſſure the Collector, that he had ſaid, the Ship ſhould not be cleared before the Money was paid; to which the Collector haſtily anſwered, "it is falſe." The Deponent then endeavoured to exculpate himſelf, by repeating the Collector's own Words, ſpoke in Preſence of ſo many People as were then in the Cuſtom-Houſe; but the Collector interrupted, and threatened to turn him down Stairs out of the Cuſtom-Houſe; which the Deponent conceiving to be grievous and injurious Treatment to one of his Majeſty's Subjects, who had always demeaned himſelf becomingly to all his Majeſty's Officers; and alſo a great Impediment and Hinderance to Commerce, as well as a Diſcouragement to his Majeſty's dutiful Subjects, Britiſh Merchants reſiding in America, did preſume to Reply, That while he had Buſineſs to do in Office Hours, he had a good Right to be in the Cuſtom-Houſe, and that if the Collector turned him out, it muſt be at his own Peril. [<hi>To Coroborate the preceding Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph,</hi> Vide <hi>the following Affidavit of</hi> John Chapman.]</p>
            <p>AND this Deponent, <hi>John Edwards,</hi> further declares, That being ſo unkindly and unjuſtly treated by the Collector, as is before ſet forth, he did not attend minutely to the Sum paid by him to the Collector for clearing out the Ship <hi>Fair American</hi>; but he declareth, That on or about the Twentieth of May laſt paſt, he cleared out the new Ship <hi>Liberty, John Leſley,</hi> Maſter, for <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and the Collector himſelf demanded of him <hi>Fourteen Pounds</hi> for his Fees; but upon the Deponent's deſiring him to reconſider it, the Collector after whiſpering to his
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010748_0006_0F817465F6E4FA80"/>
Clerk, replied <hi>Eight Pounds</hi>; which Sum the Deponent paid: The Deponent ſaith, that he knows of no Difference between that Ship's Circumſtances and thoſe of other Ships as to her Documents from the Cuſtom-Houſe, ſave only, that ſhe was not entered Inward, being a new Ship, which might make a Difference of <hi>Two Pounds Ten Shillings,</hi> and no more, to the beſt of his Knowledge; and further, that from the Practices of the ſaid Collector, ever ſince he has acted in that Office, he doth in his Conſcience verily believe, that if he had paid him the firſt Sum of <hi>Fourteen Pounds</hi> demanded, that the Collector would not have returned him any Part thereof.</p>

            <p>BE IT KNOWN AND MANIFEST to all Perſons whom this doth, ſhall, or may Concern, That on this Twenty-fifth Day of September, in the Year of our Lord One Thouſand Seven Hundred and Sixty-ſeven, PERSONALLY came and appeared <hi>Henry Todd,</hi> Merchant in Charles-Town, and Agent for the Owners of the Sloop <hi>Henry,</hi> of <hi>Bermuda,</hi> declareth, That on or about the Second of June laſt, he cleared out the ſaid Sloop <hi>Henry,</hi> and paid to the Collector, <hi>Daniel Moore,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> for his Fees <hi>Fourteen Pounds Five Shillings</hi>; in which are divers Charges, ſome ſo general, that he cannot underſtand them; and others which he conceives to be nominal, fictitious, and contrary to Law, particularly for recording Seamen, which <pb n="11" facs="unknown:010748_0006_0F817465F6E4FA80"/>
he hath been well informed the Collector hath no Right to charge, by any Act of Parliament, or Precedent from the late Collector, <hi>Hector Berenger De Beaufain,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and more particularly, a Certificate that Bond for Non-enumerated Goods was given; which Certificate by an Act of the IVth of his preſent Majeſty, entitled, <hi>An</hi> Act <hi>for granting certain Duties in the Britiſh Colonies and Plantations in America, &amp;c.</hi> is expreſsly required to be given without Fee or Reward. This Deponent further ſaith, That being almoſt a Stranger, and not long acquainted with ſuch Buſineſs, he could not take upon him with any Aſſurance of Succeſs, to controvert the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Charge with the Collector, although he had good Reaſon to believe that he was aggrieved; but that as he was afterwards complaining to ſome of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the great Difference in the Charges at the Cuſtom-Houſe ſince <hi>Daniel Moore,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> preſided there as Collector, he diſcovered that the Sloop <hi>Elizabeth, James Gillchriſt,</hi> Maſter, had been cleared out ſince the Sloop <hi>Henry,</hi> and that he paid the Collector only <hi>Ten Pounds</hi> Fees, although the Circumſtances of Cargo, and loading the ſaid two Sloops were alike, or nearly alike: For the Truth of which, he refers to a regular Proteſt, or Affidavit made by the ſaid <hi>Gillchriſt,</hi> in which the ſaid <hi>Gillchriſt</hi> likewiſe ſhews, that the Collector had exacted more Fees from him than were due.

            <p>BE IT KNOWN AND MANIFEST to all Perſons whom this doth, ſhall, or may Concern, That on this Twenty-fifth Day of September, in the Year of our Lord One Thouſand Seven Hundred and Sixty-ſeven, PERSONALLY appeared <hi>George Smith,</hi> of Charles-Town, Merchant, who being duly ſworn upon the Holy Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts of Almighty God, maketh Oath and declares, That he hath been in Trade up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of SEVENTEEN YEARS, on his own Account, during which Time he has loaded and cleared upwards of Forty Veſſels with Cargoes for Great-Britain and America; and that he hath obſerved of late, ſince <hi>Daniel Moore,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> has acted as Collector in the Cuſtom-Houſe, that the Fees paid to him for entering and clearing of Veſſels are greatly enhanced beyond the Fees formerly paid to <hi>Hector Berenger De Beaufain,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the late Collector; and particularly, that on the Thirtieth of April, 1767, the Collector demanded of him <hi>Twelve Pounds</hi> Currency, for clearing out the Brigantine <hi>Thomas, John Banfield,</hi> Maſter; to which Sum this Deponent objected, as being too high; and he finds on examining his Books, that he cleared out a Brigantine called the <hi>Roach,</hi> commanded by the ſaid <hi>John Banfield,</hi> of and about the ſame burthen as the <hi>Thomas,</hi> viz. in May, 1764, nearly in the ſame Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, when he paid only <hi>Eight Pounds</hi>; and if there was any Difference, ſuch Difference was only of one Bond, <hi>(to wit)</hi> the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ach</hi> was bonded for enumerated Commodities, but none for Lumber or Non-enumerated Goods; and for the Brigantine <hi>Thomas,</hi> Bond had been given for Lumber and Non-enumerated Goods but no Bond for enumerated Goods; but to the beſt of his Remembrance and Belief, only the Lumber Bond was given; which Difference, (if any) of one Bond he apprehends could not poſſibly Advance the Fees Fifty per Cent. After the ſaid <hi>George Smith,</hi> this Deponent, (and who is Deaf and did not diſtinctly hear the Words of the Collector) had gone from the Cuſtom-Houſe, the ſaid Captain
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010748_0007_0F817466A6FCBA68"/>
               <hi>Banfield</hi> told him, that Mr. <hi>Moore,</hi> the Collector, replied, on the ſaid Deponent's objecting to the Fees, if you don't chuſe to pay that Sum, you may leave your Papers. This Deponent therefore, to avoid the manifeſt Loſſes and Hardſhips that muſt have attended the Delay of a loaded Veſſel at that Seaſon of the Year, when the Worms diſtroy Ship's Bottoms every Hour, the ſaid <hi>George Smith</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and paid the ſaid Sum of <hi>Twelve Pounds</hi> to the Collector, thinking himſelf greatly aggrieved thereby at the ſame Time.</p>

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:010748_0007_0F817466A6FCBA68"/>
of which the ſaid <hi>Robert Cleiland</hi> was Maſter, for <hi>Grenada</hi>; which Ship had been loaded on Account of Meſſrs. <hi>Nelſon</hi> &amp; <hi>Burnet,</hi> Sir <hi>George Colebrook,</hi> and <hi>Archibald Stewart,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Owners of the ſaid Ship; and that the Collector did then demand and take for clearing out the ſaid Veſſel, the Sum of <hi>Fourteen Pounds Ten Shillings,</hi> as doth appear by the Captain's Proteſt, and the Collector's Bill thereon, which are hereunto annexed; which Sum the ſaid <hi>John Logan</hi> believing to be exorbitant, and being convinced thereof in his own Mind from Compariſon of former nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Inſtances, of clearing out Ships in ſimilar Circumſtances, he applied to <hi>Daniel Moore,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Collector, deſiring him to reconſider the ſaid Charge of Fees; but receiving no ſatisfactory Anſwer, he the Deponent added, that he ſhould be obliged to ſeek elſewhere for Redreſs; to which the Collector replied, that he might ſeek where he would for Redreſs; that he would not return the Deponent one Farthing of the ſaid Sum of <hi>Fourteen Pounds Ten Shillings.</hi> And the ſaid Deponent thinking it a Duty incumbent upon him, as well toward the Public, as to the Owners of the ſaid Ship <hi>Nelſon,</hi> to ſeek for Redreſs under ſuch Oppreſſion; he took Council, and was adviſed to inform againſt the ſaid <hi>Daniel Moore,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and to proſecute him for Extortion, at the next Court of General Seſſions, to be holden in Charles-Town, the third Monday in October next: And the Deponent ſaith, That in Conſequence of that Advice, he did lodge an Information with the Clerk of the Crown, and one of the Aſſiſtant Judges of the ſaid Court, and was himſelf bound, with two ſufficient Sureties, in a Recognizance to proſecute the Collector at the ſaid Court as aforeſaid; and that he was then given to underſtand by <hi>Dougal Campbell,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Clerk of the Crown, that the ſaid <hi>Daniel Moore</hi> was likewiſe to be bound over, to be and appear at the ſaid Court of Seſſions, to anſwer to the Information and Complaint aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>AND the Deponent further ſaith, That within Fourteen Days laſt paſt, hearing that <hi>Daniel Moore,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> had ſuddenly diſappeared, and that it was ſuppoſed he had gone privately out of the Province, he applied to the ſaid <hi>Dougal Campbell,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
Clerk of the Crown and Pleas, to know if proper Security had been taken for the ſaid Collector's Appearance at the Court as aforeſaid; but he was referred by him to the Honourable <hi>Robert Pringle,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of the Aſſiſtant Judges in this Province, who had granted the Warrant againſt the Collector when the Information or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was firſt made. The Deponent then applied to the ſaid <hi>Robert Pringle,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
and was informed by him, that the Collector had behaved very diſhonorably in that Affair, having made ſeveral Promiſes verbally, and in writing, to call upon him, in order to enter into a proper Recognizance for his Appearance; that believing the ſaid Collector to be a Gentleman, and a Man of Honor, he had too long relied upon his Promiſes, for that he found the ſaid Collector had only intended to deceive him, and that therefore he the ſaid Aſſiſtant Judge, had iſſued a Warrant to apprehend and take the Body of the ſaid Collector; but that he could not yet be found: The Deponent further ſaith, That the ſaid <hi>Robert Pringle,</hi>

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Executor of his laſt Will and Teſtament; and that they have there ſeen, that for clearing Ships, Snows, and Brigantines, from the Fifteenth of May, One Thouſand Seven Hundred and Forty-ſeven, to the Twenty-eighth Day of December, One Thouſand Seven Hundred and Sixty-four, to any of the Britiſh Dominions, (entry Inwards included) one with another, did not exceed <hi>Eight Pounds Six Shillings and Nine-pence</hi>; Sloops and Schooners <hi>Six Pounds Twelve Shillings and Seven-pence,</hi> and for Ships, Brigantines and Snows, bound to Europe, Southward of <hi>Cape Fineſtere, Eleven Pounds Nine Shillings and Eight-pence,</hi> Current Money, for the ſaid Collector's Fees; that in the Margin of the ſaid Book, the following Words are written in Mr. <hi>De Beaufain</hi>'s own Hand, "THE REGISTERING OF SEAMEN WAS DISCONTINUED FROM THE TWENTIETH OF SEPTEMBER, ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY-FIVE:" And that from another Book, received from the ſaid Mr. <hi>Rhind,</hi> it appears, that the ſaid Collector received for entering in and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Ships, bound to Europe, Southward of <hi>Cape Fineſtere,</hi> from the Eleventh of March, One Thouſand Seven Hundred and Sixty-five, to the Thirtieth of June, One Thouſand Seven Hundred and Sixty-ſix, both incluſive, <hi>Nine Pounds Ten Shillings,</hi> Current Money; and during the ſame Period, for entering and clearing out for any Parts of the Britiſh Dominions, he took <hi>Eight Pounds</hi> for Ships, and <hi>Six Pounds Ten Shillings,</hi> like Money, for Sloops and Schooners, or not exceeding thoſe Sums. And it appears to us, that ſuch further or additional Fees or Charges as can or may be legally demanded and taken by the Collector, for

Bonds and other Papers neceſſary or required by the Acts of Parliament paſſed in the Fourth and Fifth Years of his preſent Majeſty's Reign, relating to the Entry or Clearance of Veſſels ought not, in any Inſtance, to exceed <hi>Three Pounds</hi> Currency. And theſe Deponents do further declare, That it was always their earneſt Deſire and Wiſh, and they have the greateſt Reaſon to believe ALSO, that it was the earneſt Wiſh and Deſire of the Merchants in Charles-Town, to have liquidated and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the preſent Collector, <hi>Daniel Moore,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> ſome ſuch, or other reaſonable and equitable, legal or cuſtomary Fees, for the Government both of the Collector and the Merchants. And in their Opinion, nothing on their Part hath been wanting to bring the ſame to Effect, as they are fully convinced, that they are ſincerely diſpoſed and willing to pay all lawful Duties and Cuſtoms; but too tender of their Rights and Liberties as Britiſh Subjects, to ſubimt tamely to repeated illegal Impoſitions.</p>

                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> which he the ſaid <hi>Henry Laurens</hi> objected to, and aſked how that could poſſibly be; and aſked if he did not include the Comptroller's Fees alſo: To which his ſaid Clerk replied, that it was only the Fees paid to the Collector; and that he had alſo paid <hi>Three Pounds Ten Shillings</hi> Currency, as a One-third Part of <hi>Fourteen Pounds</hi> to the Comptroller, over and above the ſaid <hi>Fourteen Pounds:</hi> That he the Clerk complained to Mr. <hi>Hatley,</hi> who ſigned the <hi>Anne</hi>'s Clearances, as Deputy-Collector, that the ſaid <hi>Fourteen Pounds</hi> was too high a Charge; and that Mr. <hi>Hatley,</hi> the Deputy, anſwered, "It is no more than is due upon ſo large a Ship."

                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> ſpeaking on Behalf of the Merchants in general, to which ſuch Anſwers were given by the Collector, as may or ſhall appear in due Time and Place: That he the ſaid <hi>Henry Laurens</hi> took that Occaſion and Opportunity to move in the moſt reſpectful Manner, to the ſaid Collector, the Complaint that he (the Deponent) in particular had to make of <hi>Fourteen Pounds</hi> paid to the Collector, only for clearing out the Ship <hi>Anne,</hi> which he apprehended was an exceſſive Charge, becauſe in ſimilar Caſes he had never paid the late Collector, <hi>Hector Berenger De Beaufain,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in a Courſe of many Years, above <hi>Eight Pounds Ten Shillings</hi> Currency; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when a Paper or Document, leſs than ordinary was required, not above <hi>Seven Pounds Fifteen Shillings and Six-pence:</hi> To which the ſaid <hi>Daniel Moore,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> replied in general, that he took no other Fees than ſuch as he found by a Liſt in the Cuſtom-Houſe had been formerly taken there; that he could Account for the late Difference of Charges on Ships, only from the Multiplicity of additional Papers, required to be taken or executed, by late Acts of Parliament; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly as to the Caſe of the Ship <hi>Anne.</hi>—That if Mr. <hi>Laurens</hi> would ſend Captain <hi>Forten,</hi> with all his Papers, to the Cuſtom-Houſe, he would make out an Account of the particular Items in the ſaid <hi>Fourteen Pounds,</hi> and convince him that no more had been taken by the Collector than his legal Fees. And the ſaid <hi>Henry Laurens</hi> further ſaith, That in Conſequence of the Propoſition made by the Collector as abovementioned, he ordered his ſaid Clerk, <hi>John Hopton,</hi> to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Captain <hi>George Forten</hi> to the Cuſtom-Houſe, there to produce all his Papers, and apply to the Collector for the particular Articles contained in the ſaid <hi>Fourteen Pounds</hi> paid as aforeſaid, and bring the ſame to him the ſaid <hi>Henry.</hi>

And he this Deponent further ſaith, That he ſigned no Bond at the Cuſtom-Houſe, received no Cockets from thence, nor did he apply for, or want any: That he regiſtered no Seamen there, being not required thereunto, either by the Collector or his Deputy; nor as he conceives, by any Law whatſoever, nor by any late Practices in the Cuſtom-Houſe; and that all the Articles which he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the Collector could legally, and according to Cuſtom, charge him for on Account of his ſaid Ship <hi>Anne,</hi> at the Time of clearing her out, <hi>viz.</hi> on the Twenty-third Inſtant, are,

And ſaid to the Collector, Sir, you have charged here to make up your Sum of <hi>Fourteen Pounds</hi> paid on Saturday, <hi>Twenty Shillings</hi> for a Poſt-Entry, which was not made, nor even thought of before Monday; therefore there ſtill appears an over Charge of <hi>Seventeen Shillings and Six-pence</hi> for clearing out: The Collector angrily anſwered, that he knew, or could foreſee on Saturday, that ſuch an Entry muſt be made, therefore the whole was ſtill right: That he <hi>John Hopton</hi> then obſerved to the Collector, that there was a Charge for Cockets, whereas none ſuch were had or applied for, and therefore there was no Room for that Article to be charged: That the Collector then aſked where is the Veſſel bound to, is ſhe not bound for <hi>Liſbon</hi>? he the ſaid Deponent anſwered no, ſhe is bound to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and therefore had no Cockets.—That the Collector then with great warmth, ſaid it was no Matter, or he did not care for that, and added, "I again repeat, that I am entitled to the whole Sum which is ſet down, and if you cannot ſee the Propriety of my Charge, I cannot help you:" And the ſaid <hi>John Hopton</hi> further ſaith, That the Collector's Anſwer being unſatisfactory, both to Captain <hi>Forten</hi> and himſelf, and being prompted thereto by a Senſe of his Duty, he took the Liberty, but with all Deference to the Collector, to proceed and ſay unto him, I ſhall be glad, Sir, to have other Articles in the Account made plainer, ſome of which I think were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had, nor even applied for: In Anſwer to which, the Collector continuing angry, ſaid, "I have done, and will do no more in the Affair; I have no Time to loſe, and will not have my Time taken up in Diſputes of this Nature." Whereupon <pb n="29" facs="unknown:010748_0015_0F8174718319C320"/>
the ſaid <hi>John Hopton,</hi> (having firſt paid the aforementioned odd <hi>Two shillings and Six-pence</hi> Currency, for which the Ship's Papers were detained) together with Captain <hi>Forten,</hi> retired from the Cuſtom-Houſe.</p>
               <p>HENRY LAURENS, doth further declare, That after having heard the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception which Captain <hi>Forten</hi> had met with from the Collector, ſo contrary to his the Collector's Promiſes, when he deſired that Captain <hi>Forten</hi> ſhould wait upon him with his Papers; he the ſaid <hi>Henry Laurens</hi> went on the Twenty-ninth of May aforeſaid to the Cuſtom-Houſe, and then and there, in Preſence of <hi>Iſaac Mazyck,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and Mr. <hi>William Banbury,</hi> deſired to Remonſtrate to the ſaid Collector upon the Subject above-mentioned; aſſuring the ſaid Collector, that there were in his ſaid Account certain Articles, which ought not to be charged therein; that the Collector ſeemed to be proceeding to examine into the ſaid Complaint, but, on a ſudden, ſaid in ſome warmth, that it was a Holyday, that he was buſy, and ſhould be more ſo preſently: Whereupon the ſaid Deponent replied, that he thought himſelf aggrieved; that he did not come to aſk any Favours, but applied for Redreſs, which he conceived he had a Right to apply for at the Collector's own Houſe, or even in the Street, Holyday or no Holyday, and requeſted the Collector to inform him whether he would grant him ſuch Redreſs or not: In Anſwer, the Collector deſired him to defer the Buſineſs until next Day, and appointed Three o'Clock Saturday Afternoon for the Deponent <hi>Henry Laurens</hi> to attend him at the Cuſtom Houſe; at which Time and Place he promiſed to retroſpect his ſaid Account, in order, as the Deponent underſtood, to allow and return for any illegal Charges. And this Deponent, <hi>Henry Laurens,</hi> further ſaith, That having other Buſineſs at the Cuſtom-Houſe, he went there on the Morning of the ſaid Saturday, about Eleven o'Clock, when the Collector informed him, that he had fully conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Affair of his Fees on the Ship <hi>Anne,</hi> and was determined not to return any Part of the Sum of <hi>Fourteen Pounds,</hi> taken for clearing her out; and that therefore the Deponent need not be at the Trouble of coming at Three o'Clock, according to the former Appointment: Further the Deponent ſaith, That the Poſt-Entry before-mentioned was not foreſeen, nor even expected by him when the Ship <hi>Anne</hi> was cleared out; that the Alteration in the Ship's Clearance, (called and charged upon this Occaſion a Poſt-Entry) was on Account of twelve Barrels of Rice, taken from on board the Ship, in order to accommodate certain Paſſengers.</p>

                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr> told and informed him <hi>Miles Brewton,</hi> that <hi>William Brown,</hi> Maſter of the Schooner <hi>Wambaw,</hi> from the <hi>Alatamaha,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of <hi>Henry Laurens,</hi> 
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr> had appeared at the Cuſtom-Houſe, and there produced, exhibited, and offered a Manifeſt and Certificate, rather out of the common Mode of Buſineſs; and that as the Caſe was new to him, and alſo that as he muſt of Courſe be at a loſs, he the Collector begged to be indulged with the Liberty of conſulting with the King's Attorney upon the Matter; and that he the Collector aſſured the ſaid Mr. <hi>Brewton,</hi> that no Advantage ſhould be taken of or againſt the ſaid Schooner <hi>Wambaw,</hi> or her Cargo, in any Manner whatſoever.</q>
Therefore, and by Reaſon of the above recited FAIR PROMISES from the ſaid Collector, a Proteſt was not then extended.</p>

upon the Commons Houſe of Aſſembly, and afterwards by contrary Winds; he the Deponent in the mean Time wanting Ballaſt, and none being to be had in the Neighbourhood, he took a Parcel of Shingles on board, which not only ballaſted, but loaded the Schooner, and then lay waiting for his Owner, <hi>Henry Laurens:</hi> In the mean Time, alſo apprehending that it might be neceſſary, having Shingles on board, to clear out; he made enquiry if there was any Cuſtom-Houſe or Officers in the Neighbourhood, when he was informed by ſeveral Perſons that the neareſt was at <hi>Sunbury,</hi> a Diſtance of between forty and fifty Miles; a very bad Road, and to which he was utterly a Stranger, beſides Water Carriage fifteen or eighteen Miles, and againſt the Stream.—Immediately upon his Owner's Arrival, the Deponent was ordered to apply to the neareſt Magiſtrates, <hi>John Polſon,</hi> and <hi>Donald Mackay,</hi> Eſqrs. at <hi>Frederica,</hi> to whom he entered into Bond, with one Surety, &amp;c. and obtained a Certificate from them, (Copy of which is hereunto annexed) which was the beſt Clearance that he could poſſibly obtain, and all that was in his Power to do in Compliance with the Law, and then ſailed directly to and for Charles-Town. That he never received any Orders or Directions from his Owner, <hi>Henry Laurens,</hi> or any other Perſon, to do any Act contrary to, or eluſive of any Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that his Owner was very deſirous of clearing the ſaid Veſſel <hi>Wambaw,</hi> in exact Conformity to Law, if it had been practicable: That he the Deponent has been Maſter of the ſaid Schooner <hi>Wambaw</hi> about Twenty-one Months, and never was concerned in any illicit Trade or contraband Proceedings: That upon his Arrival at Charles-Town, he applied to Mr. <hi>John Hopton,</hi> Clerk to his Owner, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Laurens,</hi> and went to enter the ſaid Veſſel <hi>Wambaw,</hi> at the Cuſtom-Houſe: That the Collector declined to enter her, notwithſtanding that he produced a Certificate from <hi>Frederica,</hi> as herein before is mentioned; and after keeping him in ſuſpence five Days, the ſaid Schooner <hi>Wambaw</hi> was ſeized by <hi>George Roupell,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> as the Deponent believes, by the Collector's Orders.</p>

                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the Collector, ſwore the Deponent, ſetting forth, that he was bound to a Place where there was no Cuſtom-Houſe nor Officers, nor any within many Miles.

                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> had quitted this Province, having evaded entering into Security to anſwer the ſaid Proſecution, and was therefore now not amenable to the Juſtice of this Court: And the Attorney-General having further ſuggeſted that the ſaid <hi>Daniel Moore</hi> had behaved towards him in ſuch a Manner as made him, from a Point of Delicacy, decline giving out a Bill of Indictment to the Grand Jury againſt him the ſaid <hi>Daniel Moore,</hi> without the Directions of the Court, which he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prayed. The Court having taken the Premiſes into Conſideration, and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing that the ſaid <hi>Daniel Moore</hi> bad been repeatedly guilty of a Breach of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to Mr. Juſtice <hi>Pringle,</hi> who being applied to, to bind him over to anſwer the ſaid Proſecution, had behaved to him with great Lenity and Politeneſs, and truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Promiſes, had delayed binding him over; the Court therefore conſidering that the ſaid <hi>Daniel Moore</hi> had taken a very ungenteel Advantage of the Lenity which had been ſhewn him, by withdrawing himſelf from Juſtice, directed the Attorney-General to give out a Bill of Indictment to the Grand Jury againſt the ſaid <hi>Daniel Moore,</hi>

And foraſmuch as it does appear manifeſt to me, from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Proofs in this Cauſe, that the Veſſel in Queſtion has been conſtantly employed within the ſaid Province, without putting further out to Sea than her Burthen, or the Coaſt made neceſſary for the Safety of her Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to and from this Port; and there is not the leaſt Shadow of Pretence, that the ſaid Veſſel has at any Time been employed in any illicit Trade whatſoever, or that any Fraud has been committed or intended, whereby his Majeſty's Revenue can be diminiſhed or affected, or the fair Trader undermined or prejudiced, contrary to any of the wiſe Proviſions of any Revenue-Laws, or Laws of the Cuſtoms. I DO THERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORE, under the particular Circumſtances of this Caſe, ADJUDGE, ORDER, SENTENCE AND DECREE, That the ſaid Veſſel and Cargo are not liable, and ought not to be condemned and confiſcated.</p>
