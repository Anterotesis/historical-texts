            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT has ſeemed good to me to requeſt thy atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the following obſervations upon the Fall of Antichriſt, and the Concomitant Events.— Theſe matters are of vaſt importance to thee, as well as to the reſt of mankind, and I ſhall be happy if thou receiveſt ſatisfaction from any of my writings.</p>
            <p>Though there are many circumſtances upon which I wiſh to engage thy attention, there is one which I think deſerves the particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of every wiſe and pious Sovereign. I mean the unlimited toleration of the Jews. It is ſaid in ſcripture <hi>(Deut. chap. xxx,)</hi> that when the race of Iſrael ſhall return unto the Lord their God, that then he will gather them from all nations whither they have been ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the land which their fathers poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and will put on their enemies and thoſe who perſecute them, the curſes which they theirſelves have known. It may not unfairly therefore, be concluded, that thoſe will receive a large bleſſing, who, from a good heart, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them from unworthy oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>It becomes not the ſervant of the Lord to flatter, but I can, with ſincerity, declare that I am, with that reſpect which is due to thy very elevated ſtation,</p>

            <p>THE firſt place in ſcripture, where we read of the power which ſhould perſecute the ſaints for the ſake of religion (which power is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally called Antichriſt) is in the Prophet Daniel. In his viſion of the four beaſts, by which he means four great empires that were to be eſtabliſhed upon earth (which viſion is deſcanted upon by the learned Iſaac Newton, in his commentaries upon that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) he ſays, "Behold a fourth beaſt, dreadful and terrible, and ſtrong exceedingly, and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and ſtampt the reſidue with the feet of it, and it was diverſe from all the beaſts that were before it, and it had ten horns. I conſidered the horns, and behold there came up among them another little horn" Daniel vii. 7, 8. And again he ſays, "Theſe great beaſts which are four, are four kings which ſhall ariſe out of the earth, verſe 17. And again, "I beheld, and the ſame horn made war with the ſaints, and prevailed againſt them," verſe 21. And again he ſays, "And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that ſhall ariſe; and another ſhall ariſe after them, and he ſhall be diverſe from the firſt, and ſhall ſubdue three kings. And he ſhall ſpeak great words againſt the Moſt High, and ſhall wear out the ſaints of the Moſt High, and think to change times and laws; and they ſhall be given into his hand until a time, and times, and the dividing of time. But the judgment ſhall ſit, and they ſhall take away his dominion to conſume, and to deſtroy it unto the end. And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatneſs of the kingdom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the whole heaven, ſhall be given to the people of the ſaints of the Moſt High; whoſe kingdom is an everlaſting kingdom, and all dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him," verſe 24, 25, 26, and 27.</p>

Newton conceives that this fourth kingdom is the Roman empire; but that it does not, in the mind of the Prophet, take in any provinces, excepting ſuch which conſtitute its own body, that is, the the Roman empire in Europe, or, the weſtern empire. The firſt kingdom is that of Chaldea and Aſſyria, the ſecond Media and Perſia, the third Greece. The obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Newton upon this ſubject, which are inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, would appear perhaps to many a candid mind to be founded on truth, and to be ſatisfactory to prove that the power of Antichriſt is to ariſe in the weſtern part of the Roman <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pire, if we were only enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the prophecies of Daniel. St. John however ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it indiſputable, that this Antichriſtian power is to appear in the weſtern part of the Roman empire, for he makes its feat in the very city of Rome itſelf. He repreſents this power under the emblem of a beaſt that hath ſeven heads, Rev. xvii. 3; and like Daniel, mentions that the beaſt hath ten horns. The former prophet mentions a little horn which ſhall ariſe after the other ten, by which he means the power of Antichriſt. The latter prophet repreſents the ſame power under the emblem of a harlot, who ſits "upon a ſcarlet-coloured beaſt, having ſeven heads and ten horns," Rev. xvii. 3. Soon after he ſays, "The ſeven heads are ſeven mountains

                  <q>
                     <p>Dr. Geddes, in giving an account of an act of faith, ſays, "The priſoners are no ſooner in the hands of the civil magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate than they are loaded with chains before the eyes of the inquiſitors, and being carried firſt to the ſecular jail, are within an hour or two brought from thence before the Lord Chief Juſtice, who, without knowing any thing of their particular crimes, or the evidence that was againſt them, aſks them one by one, "In what religion they do intend to die." If they anſwer they will die in the communion of the church of Rome, they are condemned by him "to be carried forthwith to the place of execution, and there to be firſt ſtrangled, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards burnt to aſhes." But if they ſay "they will die in the Proteſtant," or in any other faith, that is contrary to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, they are then ſentenced by him "to be carried forthwith to the place of execution, and there to be burnt alive." At the place of execution, which at Liſbon is the Ribera, there are ſo many ſtakes ſet up as there are priſoners to be burnt, with a dry quantity of furz about them. The ſtakes of the profeſſed, as the inquiſitors call them, may be about four yards high, and have a ſmall board, whereon the priſoner is to be ſeated, within half a yard of the top. The negative and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed being firſt ſtrangled, and burnt, the profeſſed, go up a ladder betwixt the two Jeſuits which have attended them all day, and when they are come even with the forementioned board, they turn about to the people, and the Jeſuits ſpend near a quarter of an hour in exhorting the profeſſed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the church of Rome; which if they refuſe to be, the Jeſuits come down, and the executioner aſcends, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turned the profeſſed off the ladder upon the ſeat, and chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their bodies cloſe to the ſtake, he leaves them, and the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits go up to them a ſecond time, to renew their exhortation to them, and at parting tell them, "that they leave them to the devil, who is ſtanding at their elbow to receive their ſouls, and carry them with him into the flames of hell fire ſo ſoon as they are out of their bodies." Upon this a great ſhout is raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and as ſoon as the Jeſuits are off the ladder the cry is, "Let the dogs beards, let the dogs beards be made," which is done by thruſting flaming furzes faſtened to a long pole, againſt their faces.

"The profeſſeds' beard being thus made," or trimm'd as they call it, in jollity, fire is ſet to the furzes which are at the bottom of the ſtake, and above which the profeſſed are chained ſo high, that the top of the flame ſeldom reaches higher than the ſeat they ſit on; and if there happens to be a wind to which that place is much expoſed, it ſeldom reaches ſo high as their knees. So that though, if there be a calm, the profeſſed are commonly dead in about half an hour after the furze is ſet on fire; yet if the weather prove windy, they are not after that dead in an hour and an half or two hours, and ſo are really roaſted and not burnt to death.

            <p>There are ſome who imagine that the 1260 years of papal uſurpation begin at the cloſe of the ſixth century, and that Gregory the Firſt, who was at that time Pope, had ſome marks of Antichriſt. Some conceive they begin at the opening of the ſeventh century, when the Emperor Pho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>as made certain conceſſions to the Pope. Others think they begin at the year 756, or thereabout, when, upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Exarchate of Ravennah, the Pope became a temporal monarch. Others, among whom are ſaid to be Lowman and the celebrated Iſaac New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, ſuppoſe that the days of papal uſurpation begin at the year of our Lord 736, when Pepin of France made a grant to the Pope of the temporal dominion of Rome, upon the deſtruction of the Exarchate of Ravennah, to which that city for a while belonged. The period of the Pope's continuance then, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their ſuppoſitions, will end about the year 2016, or if prophetical years be uſed in the computation, conſiſting of 300 years, about the year of our Lord 2000, which they ſuppoſe will be the beginning of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:019875_0008_0FAD4526305C95B0"/>the millennium. The celebrated Mede, whom ſome conceive to have been at times divinely inſpired con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his comments upon the book of Revelation, was of opinion that the ten kingdoms aroſe in the weſtern part of the Roman empire in the year 476. It is probable that Mede is nearly right in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception upon this matter, and that Antichriſt aroſe not a very long time after the above mentioned year.
<note n="†" place="bottom">If we allow ſeventy years for the riſe of Antichriſt after the eſtabliſhment of the ten kingdoms in the weſtern part of the Roman Empire, the millennium will commence ſoon after 1806. If we add 476 and 70 to 1260, they will make 1806. If we allow one hundred years for the riſe of Antichriſt, the millennium will commence ſoon after 1836. In this manner will our ideas of the commencement of the millennium vary according to the time that we allow for the riſe of Antichriſt.</note> There is a very forcible argument that I think may be urged to prove that the power of Antichriſt will be ſoon aboliſhed. St. John, after deſcribing the beaſt with ſeven heads and ten horns (which we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret to be the papal power) ſays, "And I beheld another beaſt coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he ſpake as a dragon: and he exerciſeth all the power of the firſt beaſt before him, and cauſeth the earth and them which dwell therein, to worſhip the firſt beaſt whoſe deadly wound was healed," Rev. xiii. 11, 12. There are many commentators who interpret (and ſurely the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſeems to be juſt) this
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Here are manifeſtly two diſtinct beaſts, and therefore the prophet is willing to delineate two diſtinct things. The firſt beaſt is repreſented as coming out of the SEA; the ſecond as coming out of the EARTH. Vide Revelation, chap. xiii.</note> ſecond beaſt to be an emblem of the religious orders of the church of Rome, eſpecially of the Jeſuits, ſome of whom have tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral eſtates and juriſdictions added to their ſpiritual, by which they have greatly ſupported the papacy. Now it is certain that the Jeſuits who have been called the Janizaries of the See of Rome, have been baniſhed
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:019875_0009_0FAD452885184E58"/>from many kingdoms where they once poſſeſſed au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
<note n="§" place="bottom">Some ſay that the Jeſuits were expelled from the Pope's dominions, and others, that the order was annihilated, in 1773.</note> If therefore, to ſpeak in the prophetical language, the ſecond beaſt is almoſt expired which gave life to the firſt beaſt "which had the wound by a ſword and did live," Rev. xiii. 14; it is rational to conclude that the firſt beaſt cannot long remain in exiſtence.

Joſeph Mede ſuppoſes that the number 666 is contained in the Greek word LATEINOS. In this he is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by various commentators. I ſhould rather conceive the number to be contained in the Pope's title of Vicarius Domini Salvatoris Jeſu Chriſti. I mean in the initials of this name.</p>

            <p>It ſeems to be expreſly foretold that the power of Antichriſt is to continue 1260 years, and that at the expiration of this time, the city of Rome, where this power is ſeated, is to be made a deſolation. It is ſaid in the Revelation, chap. xviii. "And after theſe things I ſaw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightned with his glory. 2 And he cried mightily with a ſtrong voice, ſaying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:019875_0010_0FAD4528D4C9C700"/>is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul ſpirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. 3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. 4 And I heard another voice from heaven, ſaying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues: 5 For her ſins have reached heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. 6 Reward her even as ſhe rewarded you, and double unto her double, according to her works: in the cup which ſhe hath filled, fill to her double. 7 How much ſhe hath glorified herſelf, and lived de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly, ſo much torment and ſorrow give her: for ſhe ſaith in her heart, I ſit a queen, and am no wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow. 8 Therefore ſhall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and ſhe ſhall be utterly burnt with fire: for ſtrong <hi>is</hi> the Lord God who judgeth her. 9 And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication, and lived deliciouſly with her, ſhall bewail her, and lament for her, when they ſhall ſee the ſmoke of her burning, 10 Standing afar off for the fear of her tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſaying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come. 11 And the merchants of the earth ſhall weep and mourn over her, for no man buyeth their merchandiſe any more: 12 The merchandiſe of gold and ſilver, and precious ſtones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and ſilk, and ſcarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner veſſels of ivory, and all manner veſſels of moſt precious wood, and braſs, and iron, and marble, 13 And cinnamon, and odours, and oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and frankincenſe, and wine, and oyl, and fine flour, and wheat, and beaſts, and ſheep, and horſes, and chariots, and ſlaves, and ſouls of men. 14 And
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:019875_0011_0FAD4529B33C60F8"/>the fruits that thy ſoul luſted after, are departed from thee, and all things which are dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou ſhalt find them no more at all. 15 The merchants of theſe things which were made rich by her, ſhall ſtand afar off, for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing, 16 And ſaying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and ſcarlet, and decked with gold, and precious ſtones, and pearls: 17 For in one hour ſo great riches is come to nought. And every ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, and all the company in ſhips, and ſailors, and as many as trade by ſea, ſtood afar off, 18 And cried, when they ſaw the ſmoke of her burning, ſaying, What <hi>city is</hi> like unto this great city? 19 And they caſt duſt on their heads, and cried, weeping and wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ſhips in the ſea, by reaſon of her coſtlineſs: for in one hour is ſhe made deſolate. 20 Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apoſtles and prophets, for God hath avenged you on her. 21 And a mighty angel took up a ſtone like a great milſtone, and caſt it into the ſea, ſaying, Thus with violence ſhall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and ſhall be found no more at all. 22 And the voice of harpers, and muſicians, and of pipers, and trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peters, ſhall be beard no more at all in thee; and no craftſman, of whatſoever craft he <hi>be,</hi> ſhall be found any more in thee; and the found of a milſtone ſhall be heard no more at all in thee; 23 And the light of a candle ſhall ſhine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride ſhall be heard no more at all in thee; for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy ſorceries were all nations deceived: 24 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of ſaints, and of all that were ſlain upon the earth." The prophet here ſays, "Thus with violence ſhall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and ſhall be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>und no more at all." There
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:019875_0012_0FAD452A4DB65870"/>are ſome who take theſe words in a metaphorical ſenſe, and conceive that the deſtruction of Babylon here mentioned is nothing more than the extirpation of the doctrines and power of the church of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ome. There are ſome, however, of greater reputation, who conceive that the words are to be taken in a literal ſenſe, and that the living and viſible city of Rome is to be utterly deſtroyed. I conceive that they are in the right who hold the latter opinion. We read in Jeremiah, "And Jeremiah ſaid unto Seraiah when thou comeſt to Babylon, and ſhall ſee and ſhall read all theſe words, then thou ſhalt ſay, O Lord, thou haſt ſpoken againſt this place, to cut it off, that none ſhall remain in it, neither man nor beaſt, but that it ſhall be deſolate for ever. And it ſhall be when thou haſt made an end of reading this book, that thou ſhalt bind a ſtone to it, and caſt it into the midſt of Euphrates: and thou ſhalt ſay thus ſhall Babylon fink, and ſhall not riſe from the evil that I will bring upon her," chap. li. verſes 61, 62, 63, 64. It is highly probable, as it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe that the language of the book of Revelation was written to coincide with the language of the antient Jewiſh prophets, that St. John intentionally borrowed his language from this paſſage in Jeremiah, and therefore that he meant to declare there would literally the ſame deſtruction attend the city of Rome (which is called Babylon from its idolatry) as attended the antient city of Babylon, which we know to have been utterly deſtroyed, and to be at this very day uninhabited. Ezekiel, ſpeaking of Tyre, which was made deſolate according to his prophecy, ſays, "And I will cauſe the noiſe of thy ſongs to ceaſe, and the ſound of thy harps ſhall be no more heard. And I will make thee like the top of a rock, thou ſhalt be a place to ſpread nets upon, thou ſhalt be built no more," chap. xxvi. verſe 13. Jeremiah ſays, "Therefore behold the days come, ſaith the Lord, that it ſhall be no more
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:019875_0013_0FAD452B0ADE3DE8"/>called Tophet, nor the valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the valley of ſlaughter: for they ſhall bury in Tophet till there be no place. And the carcaſes of people ſhall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beaſts of the earth: and none ſhall fray them away. Then will I cauſe to ceaſe from the cities of Judah and from the ſtreets of Jeruſalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladneſs, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, for the land ſhall be deſolate," chap. vii. ver. 32, 33, 34. And again he ſays, "Behold I will ſend and take all the families of the north ſaith the Lord, and Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar the king of Babylon my ſervant, and will bring them againſt this land and againſt the inhabitants thereof, and againſt all theſe nations round about, and will utterly deſtroy them, and make them an aſtoniſhment, and an hiſſing, and perpetual deſolations. Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladneſs, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the ſound of the milſtones, and the light of the candle. And this whole land ſhall be a deſolation, and an aſtoniſhment; and theſe nations ſhall ſerve the king of Babylon ſeventy years," chap. xxv. ver. 9, 10, 11. Iſaiah ſays, "And Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of Chaldea's excellency, ſhall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. It ſhall never be inhabited, neither ſhall it be dwelt in from generation to generation, neither ſhall the Arabian pitch his tent there, neither ſhall the ſhepherds make their hold there. But wild beaſts of the deſert ſhall be there; and their houſes ſhall be full of doleful creatures, and owls ſhall dwell there, and ſatyrs ſhall dance there. And the wild beaſts of the iſlands ſhall cry in their deſolate houſes, and dragons in their pleaſant palaces," chap. xiv. ver. 19, 20, 21, 22. Ezekiel repreſents a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation being made at the deſolation of Tyre, in the ſame manner as St. John repreſents a deſolation being
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:019875_0014_0FAD452BE49CFC60"/>made at the deſolation of Rome.
<note n="†" place="bottom">See alſo the prophet Naham upon the deſtruction of Nineveh.</note> "Thus ſaith the Lord God to Tyrus, ſhall not the iſles ſhake at the ſound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the ſlaughter is made in the midſt of thee. Then all the princes of the ſea ſhall all come down from their thrones and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments. They ſhall clothe themſelves with trembling, they ſhall ſit upon the ground, and ſhall tremble at every moment, and be aſtoniſhed at thee. And they ſhall take up a lamentation for thee, and ſay unto thee, How art thou deſtroyed that waſt inhabited of ſea-faring men, the renowned city which waſt in the ſea!" chap. xxvi. ver. 15, 16, 17. And again he ſays, "And in their wailing they ſhall take up a lamentation for thee and lament over thee, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, What city is like Tyrus, like the deſtroyed in the midſt of the ſea? When thy wares went forth out of the ſeas thou filledſt many people; thou didſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandize. In the time when thou ſhalt be broken by the ſeas in the depths of the waters, thy merchandiſe and all thy company in the midſt of thee ſhall fall. All the inhabitants of the iſles ſhall be aſtoniſhed at thee, and their kings ſhall be ſore afraid, they ſhall be troubled in their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. The merchants among the people ſhall hiſs at thee: thou ſhalt be a terror, and never ſhalt be any more," chap. xxvii. verſes 32, 33, 34, 35, 36. If we compare theſe paſſages from the antient Jewiſh prophets with the xviiith chapter of the Revelation, and if we conſider that St. John framed his language to coincide with the language of the antient Jewiſh prophets, we ſhall, in my opinion, conceive it rational to conclude that the city of Rome will be for ever a deſolation.

The continuance of ſuch a tyrannic power as the Papacy for 1260 years ſhould teach us the ſubmiſſion to the Divine will which is becoming in Chriſtians. It ſhould teach us that proſperity and ſucceſs are not always in this world the conſequences of virtue. The life of a Chriſtian was deſigned for a certain aera to be greatly a life of tribulation. The prophet in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the prevalence of the Papal power, ſays, "Here is the patience and the faith of the ſaints," Rev. xiii. 10. And the apoſtle tells us, "The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our ſalvation was made perfect through ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings," Heb. ii. 10.</p>
            <p>Upon the downfall of Antichriſt the Turkiſh em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire will be annihilated, which abominable empire Daniel deſcribes. "And the king ſhall do according to his will, and ſhall exalt himſelf, and magnify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above every god, and ſhall ſpeak marvellous things againſt the God of gods, and ſhall proſper till the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation be accompliſhed: for that that is determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhall be done. Neither ſhall he regard the god of his fathers, nor the deſire of women, nor regard any god: for he ſhall magnify himſelf above all. But in his eſtate ſhall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not, ſhall he honour with gold and ſilver, and with precious ſtones, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant things. Thus ſhall he do in the moſt ſtrong holds with a ſtrange god, whom he ſhall acknowledge and increaſe with glory: and he ſhall cauſe them to rule over many, and ſhall divide the land for gain. And at the time of the end ſhall the king of the ſouth puſh at him, and the king of the north ſhall come
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:019875_0016_0FAD452DAC7977B0"/>againſt him like a whirlwind with chariots, and with horſemen, and with many ſhips, and he ſhall enter into the countries, and ſhall overflow and paſs over. He ſhall enter alſo into the glorious land, and many countries ſhall be overthrown: but theſe ſhall eſcape out of his hand; even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon. He ſhall ſtretch forth his hand alſo upon the countries, and the land of Egypt ſhall not eſcape. But he ſhall have power over the treaſures of gold and of ſilver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Lybians and the Ethiopians ſhall be at his ſteps. But tidings out of the eaſt, and out of the north ſhall trouble him: therefore he ſhall go forth with great fury to deſtroy, and utterly to make away many. And he ſhall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the ſeas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he ſhall come to his end, and none ſhall help him," Daniel xi. 36.—45.</p>
            <p>Mede and Clarke, and other commentators, have ſuppoſed that the words "neither ſhall he regard the god of his fathers, nor the deſire of women," are applicable to Antichriſt, as well as the words, "for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding to marry," which are uſed by St. Paul. I conceive that they are miſtaken in their ſuppoſitions concerning the words of Daniel. The Turks may be ſaid not to regard the deſire of women in this ſenſe, that is, they may be ſaid ſometimes to forego the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of women to indulge themſelves in unnatural luſts.

It is ſaid in Jude, "And the angels which kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their own habitation, he hath reſerved in everlaſting chains under darkneſs, unto the judgment of the great day.

The Turks, or the followers of Mahomet, have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over Egypt. The people of Lybia (which is now called Barca) and the people of Ethiopia are at the ſteps of the Turks. They are not at the ſteps of the Pope. The viſion concerning the Papal power was in the firſt year of Belſhazzar king of Babylon. The viſion concerning the Turkiſh power was in the third year of Cyrus king of Perſia. (Vide Daniel, chap. vii.—and chap. x, xi, xii.)</p>
            <p>The ninth chapter in Revelation appears alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the followers of Mahomet. "And the fifth angel ſounded, and I ſaw a ſtar fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit. 2 And he opened the bottomleſs pit, and there aroſe a ſmoke out of the pit, as the ſmoke of a great furnace; and the ſun and the air were dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by reaſon of the ſmoke of the pit. 3 And there came out of the ſmoke locuſts upon the earth; and unto them was given power, as the ſcorpions of the earth have power. 4 And it was commanded them that they ſhould not hurt the graſs of the earth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any green thing, neither any tree; but only thoſe men which have not the ſeal of God in their foreheads.

<pb n="21" facs="unknown:019875_0019_0FAD452F9A4989B8"/>them, having breaſt-plates of fire, and of jacinct, and brimſtone: and the heads of the horſes were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths iſſued ſire, and ſmoke, and brimſtone. 18 By theſe three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the ſmoke, and by the brimſtone, which iſſued out of their mouths. 19 For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt. 20 And the reſt of the men which were not killed by theſe plagues, yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they ſhould not worſhip devils, and idols of gold and ſilver, and braſs, and ſtone, and of wood: which neither can ſee, nor hear, nor walk: 21 Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repented they of their murders, nor of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts."</p>
            <p>It is to be obſerved, when Daniel mentions that they ſhall take away the dominion of the beaſt, "to conſume and to deſtroy it unto the end," that then he ſays, "The kingdom and dominion, and the greatneſs of the kingdom under the whole heaven ſhall be given to the people of the ſaints of the Moſt High; whoſe kingdom is an everlaſting kingdom, and all dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him," Dan. vii. 26, 27. The converſion and reſtoration of the Jews, and the annihilation of the Turkiſh empire, muſt therefore ſoon follow the abolition of the Papal power, that "the kingdom under the whole heaven, may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the people of the ſaints of the Moſt High."</p>
            <p>The events attendant upon the fall of Antichriſt will be important and magnificent. In the firſt place, the deſolation of Rome, where God has a ſacrifice, as he had aforetime in Bozrah, will be produced. The learned Joſeph Mede ſuppoſes that the words, "And the wine-preſs was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the wine-preſs, even unto the horſe-bridles, by the ſpace of a thouſand and ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:019875_0020_0FAD4530D5230E78"/>furlongs," Rev. xiv. 20, may be applied to the blood, which will be ſhed in the eccleſiaſtical ſtate, which is about 200 Italian miles, or 1600 furlongs, into which the contending parties will be gathered as into a cock-pit. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the next place, after the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of popery, the people of Chriſtendom will of coarſe become more united concerning their ſentiments of religion, and will make a league to expel the Turks from the holy land. Our Lord ſaid, "And Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem ſhall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled," Luke xxi. 24. It is certain therefore, that when the times of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are fulfilled, the Jews will be reſtored to the land of their forefathers. We read in Joel, "For behold in thoſe days, and in that time, when I ſhall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jeruſalem, I will gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoſhaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Iſrael, whom they have feattered among the nations, and parted my land," chap. iii. ver. 1, 2. This muſt refer to the ſecond captivity of the Jews. It is mentioned, "when I ſhall bring AGAIN the captivity," and again it is ſaid, "whom they have ſcattered AMONG THE NATIONS." This laſt phraſe cannot by any means refer to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh captivity. We read in this ſame chapter of Joel, "Put ye in the ſickle, for the harveſt is ripe, come get you down, for the preſs is full, the fats over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow, for their wickedneſs is great. Multitudes, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes in the valley of deciſion, for the day of the Lord is near, in the valley of deciſion. The ſun and the moon ſhall be darkened, and the ſtars ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their ſhining", verſes 13, 14. This paſſage of Joel ſeems to correſpond with the following paſſage in Revelation. "And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one ſat, like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:019875_0021_0FAD453109D29A48"/>his hand a ſharp ſickle. And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that ſat on the cloud, Thruſt in thy ſickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harveſt of the earth is ripe. And he that ſat on the cloud, thruſt in his ſickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped. And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he alſo having a ſharp ſickle. And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the ſharp ſickle, ſaying, Thruſt in thy ſharp ſickle, and gather the cluſters of the vine of the earth; for the grapes are fully ripe. And the angel thruſt in his ſickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and caſt it into the great wine-preſs of the wrath of God. And the wine-preſs was trodden," <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Revelation xiv. verſe 14. The paſſage in Joel correſponds in a great meaſure with the paſſage in Revelation, though the annihilation of the Turkiſh empire will be ſubſequent to the fall of Antichriſt and the deſolation of Rome. The Mahometans ſeem to have been ſent as ſcourges to the followers of Popery. Hiſtory will tell us that Mahomet aroſe not a long time after the eſtabliſhment of the Papal power at Rome.—Immediately following to the annihilation of the Turkiſh empire will be the reſtoration of Judea, a reſurrection of the dead, the day of judgment, and the perſonal appearance of our Saviour. We read in Daniel, that after the Turkiſh empire ſhall be aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when "he ſhall come to his end, and none ſhall help him," that "at that time ſhall Michael ſland up, the great Prince which ſtandeth for the children of thy people; and there ſhall be a time of trouble, ſuch as never was ſince there was a nation, even to that ſame time: and at that time, ſhall thy people be delivered, every one that ſhall be found written in the book.

                  <p>There will be a firſt and ſecond reſurrection. "And I ſaw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomleſs pit, and a great chain in his hand. 2 And he laid hold on the dragon that old ſerpent, which is the devil and Satan, and bound him a thouſand years, 3 And caſt him into the bottomleſs pit, and ſhut him up, and ſet a ſeal upon him, that he ſhould deceive the nations no more, till the thouſand years ſhould be fulfilled: and after that, he muſt be looſed a little ſeaſon. 4 And I ſaw thrones, and they ſat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I ſaw the ſouls of them that were beheaded for the witneſs of Jeſus, and for the word of God, and had not worſhipped the beaſt, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their forcheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Chriſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years. 5 But the reſt of the dead lived not again until the thouſand years were finiſhed. This is the firſt reſurrection. 6 Bleſſed and holy is he that hath part in the firſt reſurrection; on ſuch the ſecond death hath no power, but they ſhall be prieſts of God, and of Chriſt, and ſhall reign with him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years. 7 And when the thouſand years are expired, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſhall be looſed out of his priſon, 8 And ſhall go out to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the nations, which are in the four quarters of the earth, God and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of whom is as the ſand of the ſea. 9 And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  <p>The fourth and fifth verſes in this chapter deſerve to be conſidered with peculiar attention, as they ſhew that there will be a reſurrection and a judgment before Chriſt's reign of a thouſand years.</p>
               </note>, ſome to everlaſting life, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting contempt." See Daniel at the concluſion of the 11th and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 12th chapter. This important paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage has not been conſidered with the attention which it merits. When the Turkiſh empire is aboliſhed,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:019875_0023_0FAD45329A1C9DB8"/>ſome will awake "to everlaſting life, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting contempt." Will not this be the day of judgment? Is there not a diſtinction made between reward and puniſhment? Is not this to judge? This paſſage in Daniel ſeems to correſpond with the following paſſage in Matthew. "When the Son of man ſhall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then ſhall he ſit upon the throne of his glory. And before him ſhall be gathered all nations; and he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a ſhepherd divideth his ſheep from the goats: And he ſhall ſet the ſheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then ſhall the King ſay unto them on his right hand, Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat. I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink: I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was ſick, and ye viſited me: I was in priſon, and ye came unto me. Then ſhall the righteous an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him, ſaying, Lord, when ſaw we thee an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, and fed thee? or thirſty, and gave thee drink? When ſaw we thee a ſtranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? or when ſaw we thee ſick, or in priſon, and came unto thee? And the King ſhall anſwer, and ſay unto them, Verily I ſay unto you, In as much as ye have done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye have done it unto me. Then ſhall he ſay alſo unto them on the left hand,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:019875_0024_0FAD4533502BB1B8"/>Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the devil and his angels. For I was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirſty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a ſtranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: ſick, and in priſon, and ye viſited me not. Then ſhall they alſo anſwer him, ſaying, Lord, when ſaw we thee an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred, or athirſt, or a ſtranger, or naked, or ſick, or in priſon, and did not miniſter unto thee? Then ſhall he anſwer them, ſaying, Verily I ſay unto you, In as much as ye did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not to me. And theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment: but the righteous into life eternal," chap. xxv. from the 31ſt verſe to the cloſe. The appearance of our Saviour will be perſonal, after the annihilation of the Turkiſh empire and the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Judea, becauſe there will then be a reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a judgment. It is ſaid in Acts, "And when he had ſpoken theſe things, while they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their ſight. And while they looked ſtedfaſtly toward heaven, as he went up, behold, two men ſtood by them in white apparel; which alſo ſaid, Ye men of Galilee, why ſtand ye gazing up into heaven? this ſame Jeſus which is taken up from you into heaven, ſhall ſo come, in like manner as ye have ſeen him go into heaven," chap. i. ver. 9, 10, 11. It is here ſaid, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſhall come IN LIKE MANNER as he went into heaven. He went into heaven in the form with which he was crucified, and with which he roſe again from the dead. Thomas, the doubting diſciple, after his reſurrection, had examined that form. He found that he could thruſt his hand into his ſide, and put his finger into the print of the nails. He found that it was THE LIVING JESUS whom he had known in perſon.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid in 1ſt Theſſalouians
<note n="†" place="bottom">There are ſome who conceive that by Chriſt's reign of a thouſand years on earth, is meant nothing more than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of the goſpel in ſingular purity for that period of time. When he comes to judge the earth, however, I conceive that his appearance muſt be perſonal, though "the right hand of the Majeſty on high," Heb i. 3, may afterwards be his glorious ſtation.</note>, "For the Lord
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:019875_0025_0FAD45340B2C2B20"/>himſelf ſhall deſcend from heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt," chap. iv. verſe 16.</p>
            <p>The long-wiſhed for day is at hand, when "great Babylon will come in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceneſs of his wrath," Rev. xvi. 19. "The abomination that maketh deſolate," Dan. xi. 31, the ſtandard of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet, will ſoon be hurled in indignation from the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the holy people. The Lord ſhall ſoon "utter his voice before his army," Joel ii. 11. For the day, the white-winged day, is at hand, that day in which there will be joy with the good on earth, as well as with the bleſt in heaven, when the race of Iſrael will be brought once more exultant into the land of their forefathers. The time is coming, as the prophet foretold, Ezekiel xxxvii, when the dry bones will ſhake and come together, bone to his bone, and the ſinews and the fleſh will come upon them, and the ſkin will cover them above, and the breath will come into them, and they will live and ſtand upon their feet an exceeding great army. The grave will ſoon give up its dead, and ſoon we may expect in perſon the awful appearance of our Judge and our Redeemer, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. It is now therefore that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appalled by danger, and unſeduced by eaſe and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we ſhould bear the unadulterated goſpel of our Saviour in thunder

<pb n="28" facs="unknown:019875_0026_0FAD4534DCA688A0"/>of mercy. He will not be trifled with. He will have his laws obeyed. It is nobly ſaid of him by his prophet, "See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no God with me: I kill and I make alive: I wound and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand. For I lift up my hand to heaven and ſay, I live for ever.

               </gap>e enemies, and will reward them that hate me. I will make mine arrows drunk with blood," (Deuteronomy.) It is right and ſit that the will of the Almighty ſhould be done on earth as it is done in heaven. Where are the ſervants of the Lord then? are they afraid? or are they indolent? Do they not know that he has ſet his King, his King, our Lord and Saviour, upon his holy hill of Zion? In vain ſhall earth, ſhall hell oppoſe. The decree is gone forth, and is now fulfilling, which ſays, "Aſk of me and I ſhall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion," Pſalm ii. The labourers are now comparatively few in regard to the fields which are white unto harveſt It is now that the ſervants of the Lord ſhould peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly exertt hemſelves. It is now that his Spirit (which he will give to all who aſk it properly) will power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attend their well-deſigned endeavours. They ſhould remember that "they who turn many to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, will ſhine forth as the ſtars for ever," (Daniel.) And he, who has heaven for his throne and earth for his footſtool, will be inſtant concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; he will be "a wall or fire round about them, and the glory in the mid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We read in Revelation, that when the ſeventh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel founds, and "the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reign for ever and ever," that then God will "deſtroy them which deſtroy the

                  <p>The viſion of Iſaiah and of Mieah, where it is mentioned, that the nations "ſhall beat their ſwords into plow-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning-hooks," ſeems to have been miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by Barclay and others. This glorious viſion appears to refer to the time when the Jews ſhall be gathered from all nations into the holy land, and when Chriſt ſhall have entered into his reign for a thouſand years. No ſtrong nations have yet exhibited that pacific diſpoſition which the prophets fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. Micah ſays, "But truly I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his tranſgreſſion, and to Iſrael his ſin. Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the houſe of Jacob, and princes of the houſe of Iſrael, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity. They build up Zion with blood, and Jeruſalem with iniquity. The heads thereof judge for reward, and the prieſts thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the Lord, and ſay, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us. Therefore ſhall Zion for your ſake be plowed as a field, and Jeruſalem ſhall become heaps, and the mountain of the houſe, as the high places of the foreſt. But in the laſt days it ſhall come to paſs, that the mountain of the houſe of the Lord ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountains, and it ſhall be exalted above the hills, and people ſhall flow unto it. And many nations ſhall come and ſay, Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the houſe of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law ſhall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem. And he ſhall judge among many people, and rebuke ſtrong nations afar off, and they ſhall beat their ſwords into plow-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning-hooks: nation ſhall not lift up a ſword againſt nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more. But they ſhall ſit every man under his vine, and under his fig-tree, and none ſhall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hoſts hath ſpoken it. For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever. In that day, ſaith the Lord, will I aſſemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted; and I will make her that halted, a remnant, and her that was caſt far off, a ſtrong na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the Lord ſhall reign over them in mount Zion, from benceforth even for ever." See Micah from chap. iii. ver. 8, to chap iv. ver. 8; and Iſaiah, chap. i, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we conſider alſo the words in the 65th chapter of Iſaiah, "they ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy mountain, ſaith the Lord," with the preceding words in the ſame chapter, which ſeem to correſpond with the concluding words in the prophet Amos, we ſhall find that the prophecy in regard to the holy mountain refers to the time when the Jews ſhall be gathered from among all nations, and reſtored to the land of their forefathers.</p>
                  <p>After the reign of Chriſt for a thouſand years Satan will "be looſed a little ſeaſon," the expedition of Gog and Magog will then be made againſt the holy city; and afterwards there will "be no more curſe," Rev. xxii. 3, and man will be reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the paradiſiacal ſtate. If we conſider therefore the whole ſcheme of the providence of the Deity as exhibited towards the human race, we ſhall find that it is altogether worthy of that Being who is perfectly wiſe and good.

               </note> It ſeems then reaſonable that Chriſtians ſhould reſiſt evil more at this time, than at the firſt aera of the goſpel diſpenſation. For if God is deſirous that thoſe ſhould be deſtroyed who deſtroy the earth, will he not make his ſervants the inſtruments of ſuch deſtruction? To turn the other cheek to him who ſmites on the right, and to give the cloak where the coat is unlawfully taken away, appear not to be commands which are eternally binding on the ſervants
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:019875_0028_0FAD45364D1CA0E0"/>of the Lord. If God for ever made his ſun to riſe with the ſame indulgence on the evil and the good, and for ever ſent his rain on the juſt and the unjuſt in the ſame undiſtinguiſhing manner, he could not hisſelf be juſt, and wiſe, and good; which it is blaſphemous to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. We ſhould not conſider the ſcripture partially, but generally. We ſhould not attend only to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of St. Matthew, but to the Revelation of St. John. In the Revelation we read, "And I ſaw hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven opened, and behold a white horſe; and he that ſat upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteouſneſs he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written that no man knew but he himſelf: and he was clothed with a veſture
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:019875_0029_0FAD453707B9E3D8"/>dipt in blood: and his name is called, The Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him upon white horſes, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a ſharp ſword, that with it he ſhould ſmite the nations: and he ſhall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the wine-preſs
<note n="†" place="bottom">This phraſe in the prophetical language denotes great ſlaughter.</note> of the fierceneſs and wrath of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. And he hath on his veſture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS. And I ſaw an angel ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſun; and he cried with a loud voice, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all the fowls that fly in the midſt of heaven, Come and gather your ſelves together unto the ſupper of the great God; That ye may eat the fleſh of kings, and the fleſh of captains, and the fleſh of mighty men, and the fleſh of horſes, and of them that ſit on them, and the fleſh of all men both ſmall and great. And I ſaw the beaſt, and the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together, to make war againſt him that ſat on the horſe, and againſt his army. And the beaſt was taken, and with him the falſe prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beaſt, and them that worſhipped his image. Theſe both were caſt alive into a lake of fire burning with brimſtone. And the remnant were ſlain with the ſword of him that fat upon the horſe, which ſword proceeded out of his mouth; and all the fowls were filled with their fleſh," chapter xix, verſe 11, to the end.</p>
            <p>It is true, that our Saviour before Pilate ſays, "My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my ſervants ſight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence," John, chap xviii. ver. 36. At the time of our Saviour's appearance upon earth, it was determined, by Providence, that he ſhould ſuffer. His
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:019875_0030_0FAD4538D8A4EDF0"/>kingdom was not at that time of this world; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there was no occaſion for his ſervants to fight. But when the kingdoms of the world become the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the Lord and of his Chriſt, then there will be more occaſion for the ſervants of Chriſt to fight. In ſhort, I think the temporal ſword may be uſed by Chriſtians, but that we ſhould take care not to uſe it as the ſword of unjuſt revenge, ambition, or of any bad paſſion, that we ſhould uſe it, as we ſhould uſe every other thing, AGREEABLY TO THE WILL OF THE AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIGHTY.</p>
