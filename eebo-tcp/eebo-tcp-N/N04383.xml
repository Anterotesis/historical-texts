         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is the most Entertaining of any MICROSCOPE whatsoever, and magnifies Objects to a most surprising Degree. The Animalculae in several Sorts of Fluids, with many other living and dead Objects, too tedious to mention, will be shewn most incredibly magnified, at the same Time distinct; also the Circulation of the Blood in Frog's Foot, a Fish's Tail, also in a Flea, and Louse, where you discover the Pulse of the Heart, the moving of the Bowels, the Veins and Arteries, and many small Insects, that one Thousand of them will not exceed the Bigness of a Grain of Sand; with their Young in them; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ls in Paste, which have given a general Satisfaction to all that ever saw them. This Curiosity was never shewn by any Person that ever travelled. Price <hi>Eighteen Pence.</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>Each Seed includes a Plant, that Plant, again</l>
               <l>Has other Seeds, which other Plants contain:</l>
               <l>These other Plants have all their Seeds, and those,</l>
               <l>More Plants again, successively inclose.</l>
               <l>Thus, every single Berry that we find </l>
               <l>Has, really, in itself, whole Forests of its kind.</l>
               <l>Empire and Wealth one Acorn may dispense</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Each Myrtle Seed includes a Thousand Groves,</l>
               <l>Where future Bards may warble forth their Loves:</l>

               <l>All People that have been, and all that e'er shall be.</l>
               <l>Amazing Thought! what Mortal can conceive</l>

            </lg>
            <p>Note, <hi>The</hi> MICROSCOPE <hi>may be seen at Gentlemens Houses, giving half an Hour's Notice, the Sun permitting only from Ten in the Morning to Four in the Afternoon, in my Room.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE unparallel'd MUSICAL CLOCK, made by that great Master of Machinery DAVID LOCKWOOD: This great Curiosity performs by Springs only; it is a Machine incomparable in its Kind; it excels all others in the Beauty of its Structure; is most Entertaining in its Musick; and plays the choicest Airs from the most celebrated Operas, with the greatest Nicety and Exactness: It performs with beautiful Graces, ingeniously and variously intermix'd, the French Horn Pieces, perform'd upon the Organ, German, and Common Flute, Flageolet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Sonata's, Concerto's, Marches, Minuets, Jiggs, and Scot Aira, compos'd by Corelli, Alberoni, Mr. Handel, and other great and eminent Masters of Musick. Price <hi>Eighteen Pence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This beautiful Curiosity has been shewn twice before the KING, in his Royal Palace at St. James's, where His Majesty was pleas'd to make an Observation on the Excellence of its Beauty, and declar'd, He thought it the Wonder of this Age. It is allowed by all who have seen it, to be more worthy to adorn a King's Palace than of being expos'd for a common Sight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>N. B.</hi> This surprising Piece of Machinery has given such general Satisfaction to the Lovers of Art and Ingenuity, that the Nobility are continually commanding it to their Seats to satisfy their Curiosity, and is to be SOLD by the Owner EDMUND RISINO.</p>
            <p>The Inside of this Machine may be view'd by Gentlemen and Ladies, and is to be seen from Eight in the Morning till Eight at Night.</p>
