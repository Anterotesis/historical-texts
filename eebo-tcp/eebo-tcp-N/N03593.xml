            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>ALthough Preaching be more profitable to the Chriſtian World than Writing; yet both Hearing and Reading are Means of divine Appointment, for the Converſion of GOD's Elect, and building up the Church of CHRIST in Knowledge, Faith and Holineſs.</p>
            <p>The Principal does not exclude Coadjuvant Means of Grace. We hear Miniſters Speaking in the Name of the eternal KING, (whoſe Ambaſſadors they are) with Life and Power; and their feeling Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and flaming Zeal, are apt to kindle a Fire in our Breaſt by the Spirits in-breathing, without which the moſt charming Voice, is but as a lovely Song, making Melody in the Ear, never Penetrating the Heart.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand; written Sermons vaniſh not in the Air; but abide in our View; are of more frequent, extenſive, laſting Uſe; and may, by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate Peruſal, be more fully underſtood, which is a neceſſary, and the firſt Step to profiting: For, if in hearing the Word, we underſtand it not, the Devil is ready to catch away the precious Seed, leſt we ſhould <hi>believe</hi> and be <hi>ſaved; Mat.</hi> 13.19. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.12, compar'd. Certain it is, the Lord muſt teach us to
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:004390_0003_100D4DAF04FEB790"/>profit, if ever Good come of our Hearing, or Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; from him alone is our Fruit found: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed its alike eaſy with the Almighty to do us good by his Word preached or written; ſingly or both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ethiophan</hi> Eunuch was reading the Things concerning Chriſt, out of the evangelical Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Capt. 53. ver. 7. when the Spirit of GOD ſent <hi>Philip</hi> to preach unto him JESUS; ſo his Faith came by hearing the Word preached; according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14 — 17. This is GOD's ordinary and ſtanding Method of converting SOULS: Such therefore as would excuſe their Neglect of Aſſembling themſelves together, to hear the joyful Sound, by their giving Attendance to Reading on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> at Home, are quite: out of the Way of GOD's Bleſſing: But when the LORD is ſought <hi>ſeaſonably,</hi> and <hi>Diligently</hi> in all Means, he will be found in ſome of them; yea, in all of them will GOD be found, by ſuch as <hi>diligently ſeek him, Heb.</hi> 11.6 Reading the Holy Scriptures, and good Books, that are according to the Prophets, and Apoſtles, and the Doctrine preached by JESUS CHRIST himſelf, ſhall prepare us for Hearing; and the Word preached ſhall excite us to, and teach us how to profit by Reading: Prov 8.33, 34 <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that heareth me, watching daily at my Gates, waiting at the Poſts of my Doors.</hi> Rev. 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed is he that readeth, and they that hear the Words of this Propheſy, and keep thoſe things that are written therein.</hi> Not only are the ſacred Scriptures an incomparable Treaſure; but the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the meaneſt of Chriſt's Miniſters are a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Talent. To be much in Reading is a very
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:004390_0004_100D4DB1BAC49228"/>profitable Way of improving our Time. It's true, we may read much, and profit little; while we have no Faith, or none in exerciſe, to mix the Word with, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2 While, inſtead of laying apart all Filthineſs, and Superfluity of Naughtineſs, that we may receive with Meekneſs, the engraffed Word, which is able to ſave our Souls, <hi>James</hi> 1.21. We are prone to be captious and quarrelſome; and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as well as Preachers are a Savour of Death unto Death unto ſome, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. Inſtead of ſerious Deliberation, and ſolemn Self-application; deep, fixed Meditation, and fervent Prayer, before, in, and after Reading, we run over a whole Book, perhaps, without lifting the Soul up to Heaven in ſo much as one ſingle Ejaculation for a Bleſſing. Yea, its well if our Bottom Deſign, in taking the Book in Hand, and glancing on here and there a Page, be not to judge the Author: at leaſt, if we buy or borrow a good Book, at any Time, with a purpoſe to read it <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut; our extravagant Thoughts are too much taken up, from the Title Page to the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in exalting or debaſing the Writer, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or diſpraiſing the ſpiritual Food; not ſo much according to its real Suitableneſs for our Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Growth in Grace, as according to the reliſh of our nice, vitiated, ſickly Appetites. But ſuppoſe we tolerably ſhun theſe groſſer Defects, in improving the Talent of good Books; yet, we content our ſelves in once reading them; which if we were only to judge them, is not ſufficient; and in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, we may find good Reaſon to reverſe our firſt Sentence, in this, as well as in many other Caſes. In a Word, the main Thing is to receive the Truth in the Love of it, and bring forth Fruit with Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:004390_0005_100D4DB3C2E349D0"/>Unleſs we be Doers of the Word, and not Readers only, tho' it ſhould be with Tears of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is ſelf-deceiving; <hi>James 1.22.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that I ſhall perſume to ſay concerning the following SERMONS is, that deſigning to Publiſh even while I was ſtudying them, I was the more ſolicitous, (not knowing what nor how to write as I ought) that the allwiſe and good SPIRIT would pleaſe to help my Infirmities, and provide an Offering that might pleaſe himſelf, (who ever were diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;) and he fit for his Uſe, in edifying the ſpiritual Building of the Church; at leaſt, that part of it over which the Holy Ghoſt had made me Overſeer. And if there be any Worth at all in the enſuing Pages, its wholly owing to CHRIST. Not by Fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wiſdom; but by the Grace of GOD they are what they are. If you Reap any ſpiritual Benefit by the Price now in your Hands, let GOD have all the Praiſe; I deſire but your Prayers for</p>

            <p>THESE Words are ſome Part of our Saviour's Anſwer to a Queſtion, that was propounded by one of his hearers; ver. 23 <hi>Then</hi> (i. e. while he was, or when he had been Teaching, v. 22) <hi>ſaid one unto him, Lord, are they few that be ſaved?</hi> Chriſt's Anſwer follows in the ſeven ſubſequent Verſes; in which our Lord exhorts, or commands that they <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate,</hi> ver. 24 which duty of higheſt Importance, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our preſſeth by moſt weighty Reaſons, or Motives:
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004390_0007_100D4DB68B5E6A68"/>The firſt of which is taken from the Difficulty of getting to Heaven, and the Fewneſs of thoſe that ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Converſion, Repentance, Faith and Holineſs, Self-denial and Croſs-bearing, the Yoke of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and Burden of Afflictions are all hard to Fleſh and Blood! Many may run, few will win the Prize, many more will ſcuffle and beat the Air, than will overcome. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate; for many I ſay unto you, will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able,</hi> ver. 24. Many ſecure Sinners are awakened and ſtirred up by the Fear of Hell or Hope of Heaven, to take ſome Pains, forſake divers Luſts, and do many Things; but for want of ſtriving more earneſtly, and holding out to the End, they loſe all their Labour: <hi>For the Kingdom of Heaven ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth Violence,</hi> and the Violent take it by Force: Then only ſhall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord, We muſt ſtrive againſt, and beat our Way thro' many and mighty Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſtrive, even unto an Agony! Not that our own Endeavours can bring us to Heaven: Grace and Glory are God's free Gift: yet this is the Way to the Kingdom. And 'twere as good ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſtill as to riſe up and fall.</p>
            <p>'Tis our own Salvation; we muſt therefore work it out: Tis hard and hazardous; we muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore work it out with Fear and Trembling. <hi>Many ſhall ſeek to enter in, and not be able;</hi> few then obtain what they ſeek for: the more Reaſon have we to ſtrive. This is more expreſly laid down, Mat. 7.13, 14. <hi>Enter ye in at the ſtrait Gate, for wide is the Gate, and broad is the Way
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004390_0008_100D4DE477C4C778"/>that leadeth to Deſtruction; and many there be that go in thereat. Becauſe ſtrait is the Gate, and narrow is the Way which leadeth unto Life; and few there be that find it.</hi> We would not periſh with an everlaſting Deſtruction, which is the End of the broad Way; in which many walk becauſe the Way is eaſie: Let us then even croud and wedge in at the ſtrait Gate; and while Satan would improve it to diſcourage us from ſeeking, that there be ſo few Finders; we ſhould ſtrive ſo much the more earneſtly to be of that ſmall Number. Indeed, Whether <hi>few</hi> or <hi>many</hi> ſhall be ſaved, is not of ſo much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment unto us, as that <hi>we</hi> be of the happy Number. This is the firſt Reaſon or Motive, with which Chriſt does back and enforce his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation: The ſecond is taken from the Danger of neglecting to ſeek in a finding Time, ver. 25. <hi>When once the Maſter of the Houſe is riſen up, and hath ſhut to the Door, and ye begin to ſtand without, and to knock at the Door, ſaying, Lord, Lord, Open unto us; and be ſhall anſwer and ſay unto you, I know you not whence you are.</hi> This Argument ſeems to be built on ſuch a Suppoſition as this; An Houſholder invites many Strangers to eat and drink at his Table, or lodge in his Houſe; warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be ſure that they come in Seaſon; aſſuring them that if they do ſo, his Door ſhall be open to them; they ſhall have a kind Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and be entertained after the beſt Sort; The Gueſts come in one after another, and are received; but at length Meal-time, or Bed-time comes; the Maſter of the Houſe and Feaſt goes himſelf, ſhuts faſt the Door, and keeps out all
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004390_0009_100D4DB8914BF698"/>who came not in Seaſon: they ſhall be forced to ſtand without; if they knock there's no open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; whatever Pleas they make all is in vain: they ſhould have been admitted had they come ſooner; but now it's too late; the Door is ſhut. <hi>Then ſhall they call on me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early</hi> (i. e. earneſtly) <hi>but ſhall not find me. O that thou hadſt known, at leaſt in this thy Day, the Things of thy Peace; but now they are hidden from thine Eyes.</hi> The fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins came to the Wedding-chamber Door; but out of Seaſon; they knock'd, and call'd, and begg'd for Entrance, but 'twas too late. This brings us to the third and laſt Argument, which our bleſſed Saviour uſes, in this Place, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade his Hearers unto the forementioned indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible Duty of ſtriving, and neceſſary Means of obtaining Life and Happineſs; this is taken from the dreadful Aggravations of their Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, who ſhall neglect to ſeek and ſtrive, in Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and in Earneſt. Now theſe aggravating Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of being ſhut out, are reduceable to three or four Heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They ſhall be willing then to enter into Life on any Terms; Lord, Lord, Open to us; yet no Anſwer but what Bars the Door already ſhut againſt them: I know you not whence you are. Leſs Importunity would have obtained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but 'tis utterly in vain now: How dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, how intolerable is this!</p>
            <p>As I have read of a covetous Man who, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a dangerous Malady, ſent for a Surgeon, and would know for how much Money, he would undertake his Cure; but not liking his
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004390_0010_100D4DE62F3F5A28"/>Demands, lets him go: at length, his Diſtemper prevailing, he ſends again, and offers the full Sum; now double Money is demanded; the wretched Miſer is loth to go to the Coſt; neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects till Extremity force him to open all his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; but then it's too late; his Sore is incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. The Application is eaſy.</p>
            <p>You've read the Example of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and know how that (having deſpiſed his Birth-right) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when he would have inherited the Bleſſing, he was rejected; and found no Place of Repentance, tho' he ſought it carefully with Tears.</p>
            <p>Again, They ſhall plead their Admiſſion to Church-fellowſhip, Enjoyment of Goſpel Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, attending on the Means of Grace, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Duties of Religions, <hi>ver.</hi> 26 <hi>We have eaten and drunk in thy Preſence; and thou haſt taught in our Streets.</hi> In ſuch a Plea is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implied their confident Hopes of Acceptance with God, and a Place among the Bleſſed: But now to have their Suit rejected, their Pleas all invalidated, and their raiſed Expectations eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally diſappointed, (ver. 27. <hi>But he ſhall ſay, I tell you, I know you not whence you are; Depart from me all ye Workers of Iniquity.</hi>) How intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is this! To live among the Saints, and paſs for one, not only in our own, but in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Opinion of many others, while we live, and when we come to die,— yet at laſt, and after all to be led forth with the Workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity! This is another Aggravation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Sinners Condemnation.</p>
            <p>Moreover, The Extremity of their Torment, who periſh under the Goſpel, is ſet forth in the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004390_0011_100D4DBA501DE290"/>Words of our Text; <hi>There ſhall be Weeping and Gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi>— Theſe ſame Expreſſions are uſed no leſs than ſix or ſeven Times over by one Evangeliſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.12. and 13.42, 50. and 22.13, 24, 51. and 25.30. Now theſe Actions are Effects of extreme Pain and Anguiſh, Madneſs and Rage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.10. <hi>Eſt.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.8. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.54. Tis true, the Torment of the Damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed does conſiſt eſſentially, in their Separation from infinite Goodneſs; and the immediate Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the Almighty's Wrath: but there ſhall be certain biting Ingredients in their Cup, that will make the Wormwood and Gall thereof yet more bitter; among which this in the Text is not the leaſt; <hi>Ye ſhall ſee</hi> Abraham, Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and you your ſelves thruſt out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Words were ſpoken by Chriſt to his own Nation the Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and they built much on their Relation to him: <hi>We have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father.</hi>— Chriſt knew their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Thoughts and Dependence; Luke 3.8. <hi>Begin not to ſay within your ſelves, We have</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>to our Father; for I ſay unto you that God is able, of theſe Stones, to raiſe up Children unto</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. The believing Gentiles are now the ſpiritual Children of <hi>Abraham:</hi> the natural Branches were broken off, that we, who are by Nature of the wild Olive, might be graffed into the Stock of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Covenant. But we are fallen into the fourth and laſt Aggravation of their Condemnation, who were Unbelievers of the <hi>Jews, viz.</hi> that Sinners of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be received in their Room! v. 29, 30. <hi>And they
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004390_0012_100D4DE946AF2A98"/>ſhall come from the Eaſt, and from the Weſt, and from the North, and from the South, and ſhall ſit down in the Kingdom of God: And behold there are laſt that ſhall be firſt; and there are firſt that ſhall be laſt.</hi> How will it vex the Children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be ſhut out of Doors, when Dogs (in their Eſteem) ſhall be received into the Houſe? But to return; Theſe Words (as was ſaid) were uttered by our Lord to the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by natural Generation; and he tells them what their carnal Confidence in external Priviledges was like to come to; You ſhall ſee <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the Prophets; — 'Tis true, Their Father <hi>Abraham</hi> was Dead, and the Prophets were Dead, as to Men, but not as to God; foor thus our Saviour argues for the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection againſt the Sadducees, Mat. 22.32. <hi>I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>&amp;c. God is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living.</hi> As ſure as Chriſt died and roſe again, ſo ſure all that Sleep in Juſus, will God bring with him, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14. And the Elect ſhall be with Chriſt on his right Hand, and Reprobates ſhall be raiſed alſo and ſtand at his left Hand; they ſhall be brought Face to Face, as it were, and ſee one another: <hi>Ye ſhall ſee</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>&amp;c. in the Kingdom of God.</hi> As the Dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt, ſo they ſhall be firſt judged, abſolved and ſentenced to the prepared Kingdom, that the Wicked may ſee it and gnaſh their Teeth. Firſt, <hi>the King ſhall ſay to them on on his right Hand, Come ye Bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And then</hi> (afterwards) <hi>he ſhall ſay unto them on his left Hand, Depart from me, ye Curſed, into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004390_0013_100D4DBBD95D9B48"/>Devil and his Angels,</hi> Mat. 25.34, 41. <hi>There ſhall be Weeping and Gnaſhing of Teeth, when ye ſhall ſee</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in the Kingdom of God, and you your ſelves thurſt out.</hi> You that have ſought to enter in, ſhall be thruſt out: You that have eat and drunk in my Preſence, and heard me Teach in your Streets, notwithſtanding your Priviledges now, on which you build ſuch aſpiring Hopes: and notwithſtanding your Cries then, you your ſelves ſhall be thruſt out. 'Tis ſaid indeed, Mat 25.46. <hi>Theſe ſhall go away;</hi> but it is as a Malefactor goes to Execution; he is forc'd along. Now, what a cutting Thing muſt this be, for ſuch as have been every Way advantaged, much every Way, for the ſecuring of Salvation; and yet to come ſhort, when others, enjoying but the ſame Means, ſhall receive the End of their Faith, the Salvation of their Souls. This is the Matter that now falls under our Conſideration, from this ſolemn Text! This is the Work before us! The Foundation of which I would lay in theſe two Doctrines.</p>

In this Doctrine there are contain'd, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied theſe four Propoſitions.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>[I.] The Elect and Reprobates, Saints and Hypocrites, do now ſit together under the Means of Grace.</item>

                  <item>[IV.] This dreadful Separation ſhall be forced on the Wicked, ſore againſt their Wills.</item>
               </list>
               <p>PROP. I. <hi>The Elect and Reprobates, Saints and Hypocrites, do now ſit together under the Means of Grace.</hi> Ezek. 33.31. <hi>They ſit before thee as my People, and they hear thy Words.</hi> Mat. 13.30. <hi>Let both grow together till the Harveſt.</hi> When we behold a Congregation of profeſſed Chriſtians, tho' we dare not ordinarily look on any Perſon in it, and ſay, We know that Man or Woman to be unconverted; nor may we be infallibly certain that any Number of them have experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a ſaving Change: Yet we may conclude that ſuch as attend the Means of Grace together, are of theſe two ſorts, Mat. 25.1, 2. <hi>Then ſhall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten Virgins, which took their Lamps, and went forth to meet the Bridegroom: And five of them were wiſe, and five were Fooliſh.</hi>

               <p>If you enquire, Whence is it, that the ſame Means prove effectual to the Converſion and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſome; and ineffectual to others?</p>

               <p n="1">1. It's thro' the Faith of ſome, and the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of others. Act. 28.23, 24. <hi>And when they had appointed him a Day, there came many into his

So we ſee they could not enter in becauſe of Unbelief.</hi> Heb. 4.2. <hi>For unto us was the Goſpel preached as well as unto them; but the Word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with Faith in them that heard it.</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.13 <hi>When ye received the Word of God, which ye heard of us; ye received it not as the Word of Man; but as it is in Truth the Word of God; which effectually worketh alſo in you that believe.</hi> If Men did humbly and diligently wait on God under the precious Means of Grace, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive the Truth they hear, in the Love of it; the Truth would ſanctify and ſave them: but God has reſolved that all ſhall be Damned, who believe not the Truth; but have Pleaſure in Unrighteouſneſs. And how juſtly are Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers made to take their Part with all Liars, in the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimſtone; ſeeing they have made God a Liar, becauſe they have not believed the Record God has given of his Son.

2. Satan, (when and where he is permitted ſo to do) can and does hinder the Efficacy of the Means. This wicked One is ſtill preſent with us while we hear the Word of the Kingdom; and has a thouſand Ways to hinder our profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby; when he cannot divert us from attending thereon. He has Power to work in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally on our Fancies, as well as to ſteal away our Thoughts and Affections by every external Object. He can recal into our Mind Things paſt, and ingage the Invention and Affections about the Imployments and Injoyments that are fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This ſubtil Crafts-maſter knows how to inſinuate Prejudices againſt the Preacher; or if we admire him, and highly commend the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; that ſhall paſs for doing the Word; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we can remember a conſiderable Part of the Sermon, tho' we never practiſe any of it. Satan has, no doubt, a great Hand in it at leaſt, when by any of theſe, or the like Ways we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our own Souls. Jam. 1.21, 22. <hi>Wherefore lay apart all Filthineſs, and Superfluity of Naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and receive with Meekneſs, the engraffed Word, which is able to ſave your Souls: But be ye Doers of the Word and not Hearers only, deceiving your own ſelves.</hi> He joins alſo with our deceitful Hearts, while our Thoughts are buſie in making Application of what we hear, to others; This is for ſuch an one; and it may be that very Perſon thinks we ſhould do well to take it to our ſelves; and ſo both the one and the other loſeth the Benefit of a ſeaſonable Truth, for want of Self-application. Again, Our watchful Adverſary takes the Advantage of our Heedleſſneſs and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004390_0017_100D4DC0F912D318"/>Ignorance: Mat. 13.19. <hi>When any one heareth the Word of the Kingdom, and underſtandeth it not, then cometh the wicked One, and catcheth away that which was ſown in his Heart.</hi> How great ſoever our natural Darkneſs is in ſpiritual Things; yet this Prince of Darkneſs has Power to increaſe it; 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt: In whom the God of this World hath blindeth the Minds of them that believe not, leſt the Light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the Image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, the Deſtroyer of Souls will, if poſſible, keep out Conviction, and prevent the new Birth, by hindering Conception: But if once the ſecure Soul be alarm'd by Conviction, then Satan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirs himſelf to put out this Fire: and has as many Devices in carrying on this Part of his helliſh Trade as the other: he'll perſwade the ſad Soul to make uſe of merry Company, as an happy Expedient to drive away Melancholy; while he fills the Head and Heart with a thouſand Cares and Fears about the Body, and Things of the preſent Life. He could put it into <hi>Cain</hi>'s Head to build a City; and bribe <hi>Felix</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with the Hopes of a more convenient Seaſon: And when he can no longer make poor Sinners believe that there is Time enough before them, he will then tell them that their Seaſon is paſt, or they are not elected, or have committed the unpardonable Sin: But before it comes to this, he will, if poſſible, beget and maintain in them a vain Hope that they are already Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; at leaſt quiet them with this, that they ſhall do as well as Others; if ſuch as they are Periſh,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004390_0018_100D4DEEA5561EE8"/>then wo to Multitudes; as if the moſt ſhould not be damned. If they reſt not here, as being loth to go to Hell for Company, he knows how to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Doctrine of Man's Impotency: <hi>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſh<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Yet 'tis ture,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That God does freely bleſs the Means to ſome, and righteouſly withold a Bleſſing from others, who ſit under the ſame Means.

Chriſt having mentioned three Sorts of Hearers to whom the Means of Grace were ineffectual, when but one Part of four brought forth any Fruit to Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; His Diſciples ask the Reaſon of his judicial Proceeding with the Multitude; he anſwers them, ver. 11. <hi>Becauſe it is given unto you to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven; but to them it is not given.</hi> And ver. 13. <hi>Therefore ſpeak I to them in Parables, becauſe they ſeeing ſee not, and hearing they hear not, nor do they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. And in them is fulfilled the Prophecy of Iſaiah, which ſaith, By hearing ye ſhall hear, and ſhall not underſtand; and ſeeing ye ſhall ſee, and not preceive: For this People's Heart is waxed groſs, and their Ears are dull of hearing, and their Eyes they</hi> (Mark it, they themſelves) <hi>have cloſed, leſt at any Time they ſhould ſee with their Eyes, and hear with their Ears, and ſhould underſtand with their Hearts, and I ſhould heal them.</hi> They <hi>will</hi> not, therefore they <hi>ſhall</hi> not hear and ſee: They have cloſed their Eyes, and ſtop'd their Ears, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their own Hearts wickedly, wilfully, perſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly; therefore God will judicially blind and harden them.

It's for the Sake of ſuch contradicting Blaſphemers I have thus inlarged, that if it may be, their Mouths may now be ſtopped, (for every Mouth ſhall be ſtop'd at laſt) now I ſay, while there is Hope of Mercy on their Submiſſion to divine Soveraignty; yielding themſelves up into his Hands as Priſoners, Rebels, Traitors to be diſpoſed of at his Pleaſure; heartily ſubſcribing this unqueſtionable Truth, that if God damn them eternally he does them no Wrong; but if infinite Mercy ſave them, free Grace ſhall have the Glory for ever, and for ever.

               <p>Come Sinner, Conſider the Matter calmly; ſhouldeſt thou do well to be angry with thy beſt Friend, for his giving thee Senſe and Reaſon, Beauty and Strength, Riches and Houour, thy neceſſary Food and Sleep, becauſe thou (being a Lover of Pleaſure more than God) doeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all upon thy Luſts, and art like therefore to be judged by that Word, Rev. 18.7. <hi>How much ſhe hath glorified her ſelf, and lived deliciouſly, ſo much Sorrow and Torment give her.</hi> This is to find Fault that rational Creatures have Good and Evil ſet before them, and are left to their own Choice; yet not without ſolemn Advice, a ſtrict Charge, and moſt loving and earneſt Intreaties that we chuſe the Good, and refuſe the Evil; that we prefer the moſt ſuitable, ſatisfying, laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good, before that which will neither fill the Soul nor ſo much as continue, beyond an inch of Time, to beguile it with it's deceitful, empty Pleaſingneſs.</p>

Indeed we have loſt all Power and Will to ſpiritual Good; and for that very Reaſon, God may juſtly require what we are not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; becauſe he once gave us a Sufficiency of Strength to do his whole Will; and tho' we had not this Stock in our own Hands, yet 'twas in the Hands of our own natural Father, whoſe Intereſt was greater in ſecuring it, than ours could be: And you know, if a wealthy Parent ſhould, in a mad Fit, throw his Treaſures into the Sea, ſet Fire to his Houſes, alienate his Lands, and dye deeply in Debt, his Children muſt be poor and miſerable. If a Noble-man commit Treaſon, his Heir can inherit nothing but his Father's Diſhonour; eſpecially if, growing up, he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a like-Diſpoſition to Rebellion.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Sinners are not willing to do what they can; there's no external Duty but what they might perform before they have, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their obtaining ſanctifying Grace. They might pray oftner and more earneſtly, if they would; from the External Acts of Sin, they might in great meaſure abſtain, unleſs by long Cuſtom they have wilfully made Sin, as it were neceſſary, ſo that they cannot now ceaſe from Sin; and yet they would abſtain from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Act of their darling and deareſt Luſt to eſcape temporal Death, if that were to be the certain and immediate Puniſhment of the next.

               <p>Moreover, The new and living Way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, by Faith in Chriſt; the Way that infinite Wiſdom has laid out; requires that the Tenders of Life be made indefinitely to Nations, Places, Congregations and Families of Elect and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates together; there would be elſe no ground of Faith in the conditional Promiſe, Mark 16.15, 16. <hi>Preach the Goſpel to every Creature.

Thus a falſe Title to an eternal Kingdom is eaſily prov'd, in a blind Court; when the right Heir of Salvation may have all call'd in Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; many falſe Allegations, by the Accuſer of of the Brethren brought in againſt him; Thou haſt done juſt nothing for God, but much againſt him; in all thy fair out-ſide Shows and Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, Self was at the bottom; thou didſt never make God's Glory thy pure ſingle Aim in any one Duty of Piety, Righteouſneſs, or Charity; much leſs in the Courſe of thy Life; and doſt not thou know, beſides all this, (ſays Satan) the Wickedneſs that thine own Heart is privy to; what thou haſt been, and done; both before, and ſince thy hypocritical Profeſſion? Thus, I ſay, the Child of Light tho' paſſing ſafely to eternal Day, may, have his Sun ev'n ſetting in a Cloud; his Evidences ſo blotted, that he is ev'n forc'd to quit Claim to the Inheritance of

               <p>In a Word; both the thorough Chriſtian and the Formaliſt may be either willing or afraid to die; and when the living Soul is departed, the dead Corps of the one and the other lie together in the ſame Burying-Place; but their Souls ſhall be ſeparated: they don't aſcend to Heaven to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; nor ſink down to the bottomleſs Pit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; nor continue wandring in the lower Region of the Air together: but are diſpatch'd to diſtant Places, and far more different States: (of which in the next <hi>Propoſition;</hi>) Thus their Souls are ſeparated at Death.

<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004390_0030_100D4DFB7547F038"/>for a ſmall ſpace; but when winnowing Day comes, the Chaff ſhall be driven away: he who has his Fan in his Hand, will throughly purge his Floor: there ſhall not be left ſo much as one Hull of Chaff among the Wheat; or one Grain of Wheat carried away with the Chaff. A Scheme of this great Days Work we have, Rev. 20.11, 12, 13. Mat 25.31,—<hi>When the Son of Man ſhall come in his Glory and all the Holy Angels with him, then ſhall be ſit on the Throne of his Glory; and before him ſhall be gathered all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a Shepherd divideth the Sheep from the Goats.

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004390_0036_100D4E02124DBAE0"/>after another, according as the Meaſure of their Sins ſhould be ſilled up, and caſt them away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live into that boiling Pond; Oh! How terrible would this be to the poor Wretches, and to the Beholders? How doleful their Shrieks, and fearful Lamentations! How would it Pierce even an Heart of Stone, to ſee this acted before their Eyes, in the open Day; or to hear the diſmal Cries of our Neighbours, drag'd along the Streets before our Doors by Night; and deareſt Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hawl'd out of their Beds, and carried away by main Strength, to that ſuppoſed Hell on Earth: And ſuppoſe further, that God ſhould keep them alive in that fiery Pond, from one Year and Age to another; and we could walk ſafely by the Sides of, it and round it, and ſee the poor, undone Creatures ſwimming about in the midſt of the Flames; and hear their fruitleſs Cries for one drop of Water; as the rich Man, Luk. 16.23, 24. <hi>And in Hell he lift up his Eyes being in Torment; and ſeeth</hi> Abraham <hi>afar off, and</hi> Lazarus <hi>in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom: And he criedand ſaid, Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>have mercy on me, and ſend</hi> Lazarus, <hi>that he may dip the tip of his Finger in Water and cool my Tongue, for I am tormented in this Flame.</hi> What Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantine Heart would not bleed at ſuch a Sight and Sound! Now what is acted inviſibly every Day is indeed more amazingly dreadful, if we could realize it: For, what ever the Body could ſuffer in theſe material Flames, the ſuffering of immortal Souls muſt needs be greater; and Souls are dragg'd to Hell by Multitudes, of all Nations every Day: As the Soul (we know by Experience) can taſte much higher Delight
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004390_0037_100D4DD5A4207190"/>in God, than the Body can enjoy in the ſweeteſt Pleaſures of Senſe; ſo why ſhould not the Soul be capable of ſuffering more bitter Torments than can be inflicted on the Body? <hi>The Spirit of a Man</hi> (ſaith the ſacred Text) <hi>will ſuſtain his Infirmities;</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> bodily Infirmities; as holy Martyrs have ſung for Joy at the Stake) <hi>but a wounded Spirit who can bear?

What would the Damned then ſay, if they could ſpeak out all they feel under the immediate Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Fury incenſed to the uttermoſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt allay of ſo much as ſparing Mercy? — And, as for the Body if there ſhall be no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Fire in Hell to burn it; if thoſe inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Torments are only ſhadowed out by flaming Brimſtone becauſe this is moſt dreadful to Senſe; as the Glory of Heaven is metaphorically ſet forth by eating Bread and Drinking Wine, Feaſting, Singing, and Nuptial Joys; then it will follow, that the Torments of the Damned will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably greater than it could be to lie frying in the hotteſt Fire, World without End, — As the Joys of Heaven are above the Joys of Marriage, Victory, Feaſting and Harveſt; and that glorious City of God above more beautiful, rich and magnificent than ſuch an one as <hi>John</hi> ſaw, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. A City of pure Gold, like clear Glaſs; the Walls of Jaſper; the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations garniſhed with all manner of precious

Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if we conſider how God will ſet himſelf to glorify his Power as well as Juſtice on the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for ever, <hi>Rom</hi> 9.22.2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.9. Now if we can't bear the Top of a Finger, for a few Minutes, in the Flame of a Candle, much leſs an Hand or Foot in a fiery Oven; what will it be to be ſwallowed up in a flaming Lake of the moſt terrible, raging Fire? Sure they can have no Reſt, Day nor Night, the Smoke of whoſe Torment aſcends for ever and ever. But, as I ſaid, it is the Suffering of the Soul, the immortal Soul of the Damned Sinner, that is (as one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it) the very Soul of his Sufferings: God's Fury ſhall be poured out like Fire on the naked Soul, lying open to the heavy Strokes of his mighty Arm; that almighty Arm that made the World, ſtretched forth the Heavens as a Curtain, and weighs the Mountains in Scales; what heavy Blows can ſuch an Arm ſtrike! Oh! it muſt needs be <hi>a fearful Thing to fall into the Hand of the living God!</hi> Tis dreadful, to fall into the Paws of tearing Lions and Bears robbed of their
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004390_0039_100D4DD82CF27840"/>Whelps; the Hands of wicked Men and curſed Devils; but all is nothing to the Wrath of the Almighty; when his abuſed Mercy ſhall all turn into Fury and fiery Indignation: So that the Generation of his Wrath muſt endure intolerable Pains, without the leaſt Intermiſſion or Mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: It will be impoſſible for them to divert their Tho'ts for ſo much as one poor Moment, for Millions of Millions of Ages, from the moſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous Subject of their Wo and Miſery. If they could ſlumber a few Minutes, or ſleep one wink in all that eternal Night, ſo as but to Dream of preſent Eaſe or a future End of their Torments, it might ſeem to yield ſome ſhadow of Relief: but neither can that be; nor ſhall they ever have a Friend in Heaven or Hell, to ſpeak half a Word of Comfort in their Ears: If the Rich Man had not had his good Things to the very laſt Dropt, in this World, he had not been denied the cold Comfort of a little Water to cool the tip of his Tongue, in Hell's Flame.</p>
               <p>Moreover, The Damned ſhall then know aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly (tho' they now reaſon to the contrary) that their Deſtruction is of themſelves: it ſhall be evident to them, that all this intolerable, reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſs interminable Miſery is the Fruit of their own wilful Folly: Could they but think and be preſwaded in themſelves, that the Decree of God had forced them to Sin, they might fancy ſome Relief in ſuch a blaſphemous Thought; but the whole weight of Guilt will lie and bear on their own Conſciences; (of which more in the <hi>Second Doctrine</hi>) Indeed they ſhall be forced to bear the juſt Demerit of their Sins; which is the laſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition under this <hi>Firſt Doctrine.</hi>

It's true, the revelation of Heaven's Glory does little affect chriſtleſs Sinners now, becauſe of their great Darkneſs and Infidelity. As the ungoſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized World know nothing of the holy City; ſo all unconverted Chriſtians are great Strangers to that future, glorious State. Carnal Profeſſors may ſpeak much about Heaven; and Men of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing write whole Volumns concerning the State of the Bleſſed in the other World; but they know nothing experimentally of the matter as holy Souls do. A Day in God's Courts, or one Hour's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt at his Table; Yea, a quarter of an Hour's Fellowſhip of the Spirit, in Cloſet Prayer, or Evening Meditation, does give the moſt illiterate true Believer to underſtand more of Heaven, than many Years ſtudy of the acuteſt Doctor, from whoſe carnal Wiſdom theſe Things are hid.</p>
               <p>Holy Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> profeſs'd, that he knew more of the Life of Heaven, by the raviſhing Foretaſtes he had of Glory, in one ſolitary Journey in the way of divine Meditation, than ever he learned by all the Books he had read, and Diſcourſes he had entertained about it.</p>
               <p>Heaven conſiſts mainly in the ſatisfaction of holy Deſires and Longings, which the unſanctified know nothing of. They may think it a good Thing, and great, to be equal to Angels, in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Delights; To be free from Pain, Want, Labour, Care and Fear; and to be filled with Joy; but what that Joy is, they apprehend not; and the Nature and Taſte of the Water of Life, they are wholly Strangers to: 1 Cor. 2.14. <hi>But the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004390_0043_100D4DDBC98C61B8"/>Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs to him; neither can be know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</hi> Yea, even gracious Souls (the beſt of them all) ſee now but through a Glaſs darkly; and the moſt have but ſmall Sips: — <hi>If ſo be ye have Taſted,</hi> — 1 Pet. 2.3. It does not yet appear, to the high raiſed Apprehenſion of the moſt heavenly Chriſtian, what he ſhall be. 1 Joh. 3.2 <hi>Beloved, now are we the Sons of God; and it does not yet appear what we ſhall be.</hi> How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeriour then muſt the Apprehenſions of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates (whoſe Eyes the God of this World hath blinded) needs be, of the Happineſs of glorifyed Saints; if they would allow themſelves Time to think on ſuch a Subject: But no ſooner ſhall their bodily Eyes be cloſed, than thoſe of their Mind ſhall be fully opened, to take a clear View of their own Miſery, and to apprehend very much of the Saints Felicity.</p>
               <p>More Particularly: <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Damned in Hell have the fulleſt. Knowledge that can be, by Senſe and Experience, of that Evil which the Saints are delivered from. Now herein conſiſts a great Part of the Saints Happineſs in Heaven: for if there be Pain of Loſs as well as Senſe in the Damned, there muſt be a proportionable Joy of Deliverance, as well as Fruition, in the Saved. A very great Part, no doubt, of the raviſhing Joy and Extaſies of Love, that, the glorifyed are tranſported with, ariſes from the Conſideration of what they are perfectly and for ever ſaved from; even the Pains of Hell, and the Blaſphemies of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; ſome Taſte of which they had under the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004390_0044_100D4E0AAFD773A8"/>Spirit of Bondage, and from Satan's fiery Darts; (yea, and out of their own Hearts alſo have proceeded Blaſphemies;) and more is underſtood of the Power of God's Anger, in the State of perfect Knowledge; yet there can be no humane Knowledge like that of Experience: The Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned have reaſon to know what a Felicity it would be to be ſaved from Wrath; and are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, by moſt cogent Arguments, that Heaven, conſidered only as it is deſcribed, Rev. 21.4. <hi>And God ſhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes; and there ſhall be no more Death, neither Sorrow, nor Crying; neither ſhall there be any more Pain;</hi> it was well worth the ſeeking. Thus the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned muſt needs have moſt large and quick Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of one Part of the Saints Happineſs in Heaven. As the ſaved beſt know, what loſt Souls have loſt with their Souls; ſo, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as was ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Damned will for ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what they ſhall have ſeen and heard, of the beginning of the Saints Happineſs, after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, before their final Separation. With what beautiful, ſhining, glorious Bodies they are raiſed: what Joy appears in their Countenance: how congratulated by Angels and Fellow Saints: what dear Love Chriſt expreſſes to them; and what Honour he does viſibly and openly put upon them; while they are caught up in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the Air, and to ſit at his right Hand, as Aſſeſſors in Judgment 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2, 3. And they ſhall hear all their Graces and Duties, of active and paſſive O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, eſpecially their Alms-Deeds, honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004390_0045_100D4DDD697E0E18"/>and particularly mentioned, to a Cup of cold Water, given to any out of chriſtian, brotherly Love: all their Care and Diligence to pleaſe GOD, and honour Chriſt in the World, and do Good in their Generatian; every Prayer that they have made in ſecret Corners; all their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Sighs and Groans under the Burden of Sin; and inward Deſires and Longings after, and Delight in Chriſt, Sabbaths, Ordinances, and Chriſtian Conference, ſhall be mentioned before the World: And then ſhall the King ſay to them on his right Hand, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you before the Foundation of the World:</hi> and all in the hearing of wretched Caſt-aways, that their Judgment may be the more clear, and their Condemnation the more aggravated: For the perfect remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of ſo much of the happy, glorious State and Caſe of the Saints, at the laſt Day, as they have been made to ſee and know, before their entrance into Blackneſs of Darkneſs, ſhall remain with them for ever, to help keep alive a Senſe of what they have loſt, by their Folly and Unbelief.</p>
               <p>And then, <hi>Thirdly;</hi> Their Underſtandings will be greatly inlarged to take in, who can tell what Ideas of Heaven's Glory, and the Saints Felicity, for their own endleſs Vexation. If the Unſanctified may, by common Illumination, know ſomething of the Powers of the World to come, here, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5. Hereafter (though they ſhall taſte nothing of the Goodneſs of God's Word paſt, yet) they ſhall know more of the World then come, unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more than now can enter into their Hears to
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:004390_0046_100D4E0CC8F17D60"/>conceive. As their Bodies ſhall be ſtrengthned to endure the hotteſt Fire of God's burning Wrath, without conſuming a jot; ſo their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions may be proportionably inlarged, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what they now can reach unto; and their Memories may be ſtrengthned to recal and retain every aggravating Circumſtance of all their Sin on Earth, Luk. 16.25. <hi>Son Remember,</hi>—</p>
               <p>We know that Thought and Conſideration is eſſential to the humane Nature; and it is known, by univerſal Experience, that by this natural Power of the Soul, we are able to bring Things out of Sight, and at the greateſt Diſtance; yea, Things paſt or future, and purely ſpiritual too (as well, though not ſo eaſily as the Objects of Senſe) into plain View as it were before our Eyes; or as if ſuch Things were ſounding in our Ears. Thus, when a Man is on a deſolate Iſland at Sea, or cloſe Priſoner in a ſtrange Land; how ſenſibly does he repreſent to himſelf the happy Freedom of others, in their own beloved Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, commodious Habitations, with Meat and Drink to the full, and change of Raiment; warm Beds; their Wives with them, and Children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them; while himſelf is deſtitute of all theſe Comforts; and this makes his Iron Fetters to eat into his very Soul: how much more in the Caſe before us, in which not only is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion a million Times greater, but the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city alſo of apprehending, comparing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be inconceiveably inlarged; and the Damned, as was ſaid, have nothing to divert them from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, deep and fixed Meditation on this very Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:004390_0047_100D4DDF44B185D8"/>
It remains yet to be conſidered, more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how theſe Apprehenſions of the Damned in Hell, concerning the Saints Happineſs in Heaven, ſhall aggravate their own eternal Miſery. That their Miſery ſhall be Eternal is evident from many plain Scriptures, that have been already mentioned; and it muſt of neceſſity be ſo, for in Hell God will not puniſh them leſs than their Iniquities deſerve, which are infinite, in regard of the Object againſt whom they are committed: Now it being impoſſible that a finite Creature ſhould, in the longeſt ſpace of Time, make full Satisfaction to an infinite GOD, (as Chriſt, who was an infinite Perſon, did for the Elect) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Puniſhment muſt be infinite in Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: beſides, the earneſt Wiſh, and hearty De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of every Bond-ſlave of Satan is, that he might live for ever on Earth, in Health, Honour and Proſperity, that ſo he might fulfil the Deſires of the Fleſh and the Mind, (<hi>i. e.</hi> that he might Sin) for ever. So that there is a Sort of Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Evil of Sin: Nothing indeed, if we ſpeak abſolutely, can be infinitely Evil: there is but one Infinite, and he is infinitely Good: Yet, Reprobates are as it were guilty of an infinite Evil; both as Sin is contrary to the Nature, Will and Honour of a Being, infinite in Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Goodneſs, Equity and Holineſs; and alſo, in that there is a Diſpoſition to Sin, in ſuch as are not changed, that will never ceaſe; but if the Sinner were under a I aw to Eternity, he would be a Tranſgreſſor to Eternity; if God ſhould heap Mercies on him to Eternity, he would abuſe them to Eternity. Now the leaſt
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:004390_0048_100D4E0EE1453258"/>Degree of Torment, to laſt for ever, is horrible to think of! Such as never had ſufficient Means of Salvation; that never once rebelled againſt the Light of the Goſpel, though (dying Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) their Puniſhment will be more tolerable than ours if we die in Unbelief; yet to lie in the ſofteſt Fire for ever, how Diſmal! Yea, if it were but to undergo the grievous Pain of a Tooth, for ever and for ever, it would tire out the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Patience! But now, when all the bitter, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtinging Ingredients imaginable, and far beyond conceit, ſhall be com-mixed in the Cup of divine Wrath, for the Goſpel-Sinner to drink off: what Tongue can expreſs, or Heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive one thouſand millionth Part of their pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Anguiſh! If we could ſuppoſe that all the Angels had fallen, and all the Race of <hi>Adam</hi> had periſhed remedileſly; ſo that there had been no <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, nor <hi>Lazarus</hi> to have lien in it; no glorified Saint or Angel, with whoſe Happineſs to have compared our Miſery; yet eternal Damnation would have made every Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive from God to cry out, <hi>My Puniſhment is greater than I can bear!</hi> But they are not Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, they are Realities that we have to do with: and the Aggravation of the Miſery of ſome, ariſing from their Apprehenſion of the Happineſs of others, their Fellow-Creatures, and once Fellow-Sinners, may be conſidered, firſt, more Generally, as it concerns all the Damned; and then more Particularly, as it concerneth ſuch as periſh from under the Goſpel.</p>

And the Ungoſpellized Nations, now ſince Chriſt came and brake down the Partition Wall between <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> will have the ſame bitter Pill to chew, while they conſider how that ſome in all Ages, of one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or other, and ſome of all Nations, in one Age or other, are redeemed and ſaved; this will make them lament and blaſpheme, that the Goſpel was not ſent to their Nation, and in their Day on Earth. Now to take the whole World of Reprobates together, in what ever Age or Nation they lived, that periſh either for lack of Viſion, or for rebelling againſt the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Scripture both; we may a little conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in a more general Way, how it will vex and torment all the Damned, while they view and ſurvey in their Heaven-piercing Thoughts, the Place and State of the Glorified; and conſider,</p>

1. That there was a poſſibility of their having been all happy, as well as they that are ſo, or inſtead of them; there being nothing in the Nature of God or Man againſt it. Indeed, the Purpoſes of God are unalterable; it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that he ſhould ſee any manner of Cauſe or Reaſon, in Time, to change his Mind, which he ſaw not perfectly from Eternity to have hindered his purpoſing any Thing but what he ſhould reſolvedly bring to paſs, in its Seaſon: and in this reſpect, its impoſſible that any one Thing in the World ſhould be any otherwiſe than it is, has been, and ſhall be: and on the other Hand, 'tis, in it ſelf, a Thing poſſible with God to turn the Devils into holy Angels again; and doubtleſs the eternal remembrance of what they once were, and what their then Fellow-Servants now unchangeably are, does double their own Torment and Vexation; as well as Chriſt's tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him, not the angelical but human Nature. But now the Caſe is different with Men; they were all alike ruined in the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> and alike capable of recovery by the ſecond: ſo that Thouſands of Millions will ſay, in Hell (and vex themſelves for ever with ſuch fruitleſs Wiſhes) Oh! That the Goſpel of Salvation had been ſent to us: Oh! That we had but heard the joyful Sound: Oh! That we had lived in ſuch Times and Places as were bleſſed with Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, Miniſters and Bibles. And ten thouſand Times ten Thouſand, Oh! That the Goſpel had been made effectual to us: But more of this afterwards.</p>

2. There are the ſame natural and vehement Deſires, and Thirſtings of Soul after Happineſs in them that are ſaved and in them that periſh. By Nature they are both alike capable of, and the one as well as the other eager in purſuing after Happineſs: Only this is the Happineſs of the Elect; when God is effectually calling ſuch as he had Fore-known and Predeſtinated, he opens their Eyes and cauſes them to ſee and know that Happineſs does not lie in the Pleaſures, Profits and Honours of the World that now is, where they have been climbing high, digging deep, and turning every Stone, in ſearch of this Treaſure; till the Spirit of Grace and Truth conducts them into the Field where it lies hid from all natural Men, who are yet ſolicitouſly inquiſitive after the chiefeſt Good of the rational Creature; Pſal. 4, 6, 7. <hi>Many there be that ſay, Who will ſhew us any Good? Lord, life thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon us: Thou haſt put, gladneſs in my Heart, more than in the time that their Corn and their Wine increaſed.</hi> Corn is our natural Life and Strength; Wine is the joy of Man's Heart: The former one of the moſt neceſſary, the latter one of the moſt excellent Products of the Earth; yet both, together with all overflowing abundance of Milk and Honey, Silver and Gold, make up but an empty and tranſient Felicity for an immortal Spirit. Where is the Bleſſedneſs you ſpake of? May the deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Worldling ſay to himſelf, on his Bed on Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, when the Night of Death has overtaken him: (for when his Sparks of worldly Wiſdom and Wealth, or legal Righteouſneſs are gone out,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:004390_0052_100D4E4929E69000"/>he muſt <hi>lie down in Sorrow;</hi> the Mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it; this ſhall <hi>ye have of mine Hand,</hi> Iſa. 50.11) Hadſt thou not an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to diſtinguiſh between Light and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; a Will to chuſe the Good and refuſe the Evil; Affections to embrace a ſuitable, ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, immortal Good; an hungry Soul panting after ſome living Spring, and boundleſs Ocean, to fill its immenſe Deſires? And couldeſt thou find nothing but Husks and Duſt of the Earth, the Swine and Serpents Meat, to feed upon? Who knows the Power that theſe Self-reflections will have, to Torment undone Reprobates of all Times and Places, Nations and Generations, from firſt to laſt? They were naturally alike capable of eternal Felicity with others; and had the ſame vehement, inceſſant Deſires to be Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: Yea, this Capacity, and theſe Deſires too will remain with them for ever, to increaſe their Torment: For though we can't Hope for a Good we know unattainable, yet we may Deſire it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Truth in Hand, thus generally conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is further evident from our own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in the trifles of this vain World and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany Life. The Trouble and Vexation of proud, diſcontented Folks under their Afflictions and Croſſes; Poverty, and low, deſpicable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunſtances is more than doubled by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Riches and Proſperity, Eaſe and Preferment of others, whom they envy. If none were above them they would not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves low, though on the ſame level they now are. <hi>Rachel's</hi> want of Children had been a tolerable Evil, if <hi>Leah</hi> alſo and the Handmaids
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:004390_0053_100D4E1666595A30"/>had been Barren. The Principle from which we are moſt ſtrongly inclined, thus to rub our Sores with Salt and Vinegar, is rooted in our very Nature: We ſee the Fruits of it in our Children, when they are very little, and as they grow up: How diſcontented is one little One in the Family with his old Coat, when his Brother firſt puts on a new one; though he made no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint before: if we give but an Apple to one he rejoyces, but then give two unto another and the firſt will think he has leſs than none, unleſs he may be made equal with his Mate. The elder brother in the Parable nurmurs, becauſe the younger is ſo joyfully received and entertained. The Caſe of <hi>Joſepb</hi> and his Brethren ſerves fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to illuſtrate and comfirm the Matter: You know how to apply it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. We come now, more particularly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the inexpreſſible Vexation and Anguiſh of Goſpel-Sinners in Hell; unconceivably aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated from the clear and large Apprehenſions they ſhall have of the Saints Happineſs in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. We know that the Eſſence of Damnation, of the Torments of Hell, does conſiſt in the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Separation from the infinitely glorious JEHOVAH, the only ſatisfying Portion of the immortal, heaven-born Soul; and the immediate Impreſſions of his Wrath, who is a conſuming Fire: The loſs of the Society both of Saints and Angels is ſmall to this, if we conſider them as ſeparable. And on the other Hand, All that the Legions of Devils could do againſt us were, in compariſon of falling into the Hands of the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:004390_0054_100D4E4AB283D2E0"/>living GOD, leſs than the trouble of a few Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetto's, to being caſt into a Den of hungry Lions: However, to think of ſitting down with <hi>Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> in the Kingdom of God is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Thought, to his natural or ſpiritual Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and to be ſeparated from godly Friends and Neighbours, and for ever excluded the Place of their eternal Abode, will be tormenting. Ah! to left up their Eyes being in Torment and ſee ſo many Thouſands of all Nations, Kindreds, People and Tongues, ſtanding before the Throne, and before the Lamb, cloathed with Robes, made White in his Blood, with Palms in their Hands, Crowns on their Heads, and fulneſs of Joy in their Hearts; ſerving God Day and Night (where indeed there is no Night) in his Temple, where he that ſits on the Throne ſhall dwell among them; and the Lamb, who is in the midſt of the Throne ſhall feed them, and lead them to living Fountains of Water; where God ſhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes; this Sight of the Eye will affect and afflict, pierce and rend the Hearts of the Damned; eſpecially ſuch as periſh from under the Goſpel: For, Conſider;</p>

They were not only as capable of enjoying &amp;c but all this was offered to them, as well and as much as unto them who accepted the Offer; Mark. 16.15, 16. <hi>Go Preach the Goſpel, to every Creature: He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be Saved.</hi> Heb. 4.2. <hi>For unto us was the Goſpel preached as well as unto them; but the Word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with Faith in them that heard it.</hi> Luk. 14.16, 17. <hi>A certain Man made a great Supper, and bade many;
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:004390_0055_100D4E18221DE300"/>and ſent his Servants at Supper time to ſay unto them who were bidden, Come, for all things are ready.</hi> Iſa. 55.1, 2. <hi>Ho, every one that thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, come to the Waters; and he that hath no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, come, buy Wine and Milk, without Money and without Price.</hi> Joh. 7.37. <hi>In the laſt Day, that great Day of the Feaſt, Jeſus ſtood and cried, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, If any Man Thirſt, let him come to me and Drink.</hi> Joh. 6.37. <hi>Him that comes to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Rev. 3.20. <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the Door and knock; if any Man hear my Voice and open the Door, I will come in to him, and ſup with him, and he with me.</hi>

               <p>To ſet down all the Offers and Tenders of Grace and Mercy, that God is freely making to all Sorts of Sinners under the Goſpel (one only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) would be to tranſcribe a great Part of the Bible: That moſt liberal Offer, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. deſerves a peculiar Remark; <hi>And the Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come: And let him that heareth, ſay, Come: And let him that is athirſt, come: and whoſoever</hi> WILL, <hi>let him take the Water of Life freely.</hi> In this, almoſt the laſt and ſweeteſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation in the holy Book, we may obſerve ſeveral Things.</p>

                  <item>[3.] The Condition is only a willingneſs to accept the Offer; <hi>Whoſoever will;</hi> which is not an antecedent willingneſs to our actual coming; as if none were concerned in this Offer, but ſuch as the Tenders of Grace do find ready bent to accept of Life; but the Offer is made to ſuch as have a Will not to come to Chriſt for Life: Life is ſet and held before our Eyes; and if, at any time, we like the free offer of Grace and Glory, on no other Condition but our acceptance, tis freely ours; if we deſire to have it without buying, we may have it for asking; yea, we may have it for taking. When Chriſt ſays, <hi>If any Man thirſt; let him come,</hi> Joh. 7.37. The ſlothful, or deſponding Sinner ſays within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, That is not for me; for I do not Thirſt: but this Clauſe added to the former in the text under Conſideration, <hi>Let him that is athirſt come; and who ſoever will let him take the Water of Liſe freely,</hi> leaves the Unbeliever ſpeechleſs: for what will the Sinner ſay, I am not willing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and ſaved, made holy and happy, in God's Way?

               <p>Goſpel Sinners in Hell do know to their Coſt, even to Killing Vexation and raging Madneſs with themſelves, that what I have now laid down from the Scripture is true; and that they are Damned for ever becauſe they were not willing to be eternally Happy; and purged and ſanctified in order there unto: Jer. 13.27. <hi>O Jeruſalem, wilt thou not be made clean?

And becauſe they were not of the Number given to Jeſus Chriſt, therefore (may they ſay) Chriſt had no Warrant to ſave them; Joh. 17.2. <hi>As thou haſt given him Power over all Fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal Life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi> Joh. 12.39.40 <hi>Therefore they could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, becauſe that Eſaias ſaid again, He hath blinded their Eyes, &amp; hardned their Hearts, that they ſhould not ſee with their Eyes, nor underſtand with their Heart, and be converted, and 1 ſhould heal them.</hi>

Or, Suppoſe a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men to run themſelves deeply in Debt, and having nothing to pay, they are to be fold for Slaves; but before the Time comes for their being Shipp'd off, the Creditor has compaſſion on them, and ſends to the Priſon, a faithful Servant or beloved Son, to make them all this gracious offer, That if they will own the Debt, and but ſay they would gladly diſcharge it if they were able, his Father or Maſter will frankly for give all that they owe, and give it under his Hand and Seal for preſent Security, till, in a ſhort Time, they ſhall not only be delivered out of Priſon, but put in a ſure way to live at Eaſe and to the Full, in Wealth and Honour, more than Heart could wiſh: Now, if one and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould thankfully embrace the offer; but the biggeſt Part are of another Mind; they either deny or leſſen the Debt, diſcredit or ſlight this good News; and even ſcorn to be beholding to the Compaſſionate Creditor; till his abuſed

God indeed knows that many
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:004390_0063_100D4E20C534AFF8"/>will die in their Sins, for want of Faith in Chriſt; but he knows alſo that it is not ſo much becauſe they <hi>cannot</hi> believe, as becauſe they <hi>will not</hi> come to Chriſt that they might have Life. How evident then is it to all, but ſuch as wilfully ſhut their own Eyes, how little relief it can be to the Damned for them to think in the Flames of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> That God did from all Eternity Decree to leave them to their own Choice; and then to puniſh them for their wilful Unbelief and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the firſt Confideration, <hi>viz.</hi> That Goſpel, Impenitent Sinners, not only have a Capacity of being Happy; but Grace and Glory were freely offered them, as well and as much as to others; but they wilfully rejected the Offer; yea tho' they were frequently and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreated to accept the ſame; and had all manner of Arguments uſed with them, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to turn and live: which may be diſtincty conſidered, as another Evidence of the doctrinal Truth, now under Conſideration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Damned in Hell ſhall have their Hell-Fire inflamed and inraged, while they will for ever remember, how perfectly Happy the glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Saints are, in accepting thoſe very Offers they themſelves refuſed; yea after very frequent and moſt importunate Intreaties that they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Life and Immortality, brought to Light by the Goſpel. It will ever be freſh in their Minds, how the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt have pleaded with them: begging, as if it had been a Starving Beggar, pleading for an Alms; or a condemned Man, begging for his Life, that they
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:004390_0064_100D4E54673E8240"/>would think on their Ways; conſider their lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter End; prize and improve all Seaſons of Grace; ſeek the Lord, in Seaſon and in Earneſt; Make much of Time, even the Minutes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, fleeting Time; giving all Diligence to make their Calling and Election ſure; working out their own Salvation, with Fear and Tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait Gate; and taking the Kingdom of Heaven by Force; 2 Cor. 5.20. <hi>Now then, we are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt; a though God did beſeech you by us; we pray you in Chriſt's Stead be ye reconciled to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They will remember how often ſuch Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as theſe were repeated in their Ears; O that my People were Wiſe, that they underſtood this; that they would conſider their latter End. Wilt thou not be made clean; when ſhall it once be? Be inſtructed, O <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> leſt my Soul depart from thee, How ſhall I give thee up, <hi>Ephraim?</hi> How ſhall I deliver thee, <hi>Judah?</hi> Turn ye, Turn ye; why will ye die, O Houſe of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> As I Live, ſaith the Lord, I have no Pleaſure in the Death of him that dieth: Turn you therefore from all your evil Ways; ſo Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſhall not be your Ruin. Waſh you; make you clean; put away the Evil of your Doings, from before mine Eyes; ceaſe to do Evil; learn to do Well: Come now, let us reaſon together ſaith the Lord: Though your Sins are as Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, they ſhall be as white as Snow; though they be red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wool. Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found; call ye upon him while he is near: Let the Wicked forſake his Way, and the unrighteous Man his
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:004390_0065_100D4E2272008D68"/>Tho'ts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have Mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon: For my Tho'ts are not your Tho'ts, neither are your Ways my Ways, ſaith the Lord: For as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ſo are my Ways higher than your Ways, &amp; my Tho'ts than your Tho'ts. Ask and ye ſhall receive; Seek and ye ſhall find; Knock and it ſhall be opened unto you. Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you Reſt. Take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am Meek and lowly in Heart; and ye ſhall find Reſt to your Souls: For my Yoke is eaſy, and my Burden is light. O do not that abominable Thing which my Soul hates, ſaith the Lord.</p>
               <p>Theſe and a thouſand more like Paſſages, which they have read and heard in Time, will a million million Times over paſs through their thoughtful Minds in Hell: And they will be forced to call to Mind all the ſtrong Reaſons and powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that Chriſt's Miniſters have uſed with them; if poſſible to have gained their Conſent to their own eternal Happineſs, on Goſpel Terms; and to have kept them back from this Place of Torment. How they have been warned with many compaſſionate Tears of Grief and Love, to flie from the Wrath to come; and pleaded with by all the Regards they owed to the creating Mercy &amp; redeeming Love; God's Glory, and their own Safety &amp; Comfort; preſent Peace and everlaſting Reſt: arguing from the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and utility of a found Converſion and Goſpel Converſation; &amp; from the incomparable, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:004390_0066_100D4E567212D130"/>Delights of Communion with God: en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating them to have ſome pity on their poor, periſhing Souls; and not to deſtroy themſelves, and ſell eternal Joys for an empty Song, a Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der full of Wind, a dry Leaf, a momentany Bubble, Vapour and Smoke, the Dream of a Shadow, leſs than nothing, and Vanity of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities: (Such is all ſinful Delight.)</p>
               <p>It will be impoſſible for the Priſoners of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Darkneſs, who once had the Light, to forget how they were told of this bottomleſs Pit and burning Lake, to fright them from Sin; and how the Glory of Heaven was diſplayed, to allure them to Chriſt. All that ever they heard or read, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his tranſcendent Beauty, and unſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Riches; what he had done for them, would be to them, and bring them to, if they would but have given the Conſent of their Hearts to an Eſpouſal with the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, the Heir of all Things. Moreover, all Counſels and Directions how they ſhould ſeek God ſo as to find him; and infallibly ſecure an Intereſt in Chriſt; that were plainly laid down before them, in publick or private; but they had no Heart to any Thing but Sin; they could find no leaſure to think on theſe Things in Time; and now they can't but vex their Souls to Death with the Thoughts of them to Eternity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Goſpel Sinners, in the Place of Torment, will remember what variety of Means God uſed with them, in their life Time, as well as with others that are ſaved: Not only by his written Word, (unfolded, applied and enforced, in many excellent Books put into their Hands) and the
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:004390_0067_100D4E24C33C3770"/>publick Miniſtry; (Either in a more ſtated Courſe, or Sermons that they have occaſionally heard, from one Miniſter and another, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad and at home) but by Mercies and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions alſo, has the Lord been ſeeking to reclaim and reform them, Iſa. 1.2 <hi>Hear, O Heavens, and give Ear, O Earth, for the Lord hath ſpoken; I have nouriſhed and brought up Chilaren, and they have rebeſled againſt me.</hi> Jer 5.23, 24 <hi>But this People hath a revolting and rebellious Heart, they are revolted and gine: Neither ſay they in their Heart, let us now fear the Lord our God, who giveth Rain; both the former and the latter, in his Seaſon: He reſerveth unto us the appointed Weeks of the Harveſt.</hi> Did they not know how they ought to have feared the Lord and his Goodneſs; of which not only the Earth was full; but God filled their Hearts with Food and Gladneſs: Their Life, and Health, and Limbs were precious in God's Sight: Their Houſes he filled with all good Things: Their Fields and Flocks he made fruitful; and often ſpake to them in their Proſperity; drawing them with the Cords of a Man, with the Bands of Love: Rem. 12.1. <hi>I beſeech you therefore Brethren, by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, that you preſent your Bodies a living Pacrifice, holy, acceptable to God; which is your reaſonable Service:</hi> but they would not hear: Thus they deſpiſed the Riches of divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Forbearance and Long ſuffering, ſo kindly taking them by the Hand, to lead them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; while the Sun-Beams of Love and Bounty, inſtead of melting, did harden their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Hearts: and now they muſt pay for all in Hell I indignation and Wrath, Tribulation and
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:004390_0068_100D4E5907FFA738"/>Anguiſh, are but the Treaſures that they had been hoarding up, all their Life long, againſt this Day of Wrath. If theſe ungrateful Wretches had never heard the Goſpel; yet common-Mercy, thus ſhamefully abuſed, would have been an authentick Witneſs for God, againſt the Sinner: Act 14.17. <hi>Nevertheleſs, be left not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without Witneſs, in that he did Good, and gave us Rain from Heaven, and fruitful Seaſons, ſilling our Hearis with Food and Gladneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then every worldly Croſs and Trouble in the Fleſh; all Vexations and Afflictions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by an Hedge of Thorns was made in all their ſinful Ways; which yet their inſatiable Luſts, and Head ſtrong Paſſions brake through; will come in as ſo many Items againſt them: And becauſe the Lord thus purged them, and they were not purged: but in their Affliction treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed yet more againſt the Lord, therefore his Fury ſhall reſt on them for ever! They would neither hearken to the Voice of his Word nor Rod, Miniſters, Parents, godly Neighbours, Death of Friends, narrow Eſcapes, recovery from Sickneſs, deliverance out of Captivity: and a thouſand thouſand more of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Intimations concerning their Duty &amp; Intereſt; Warnings of their Sin and Danger, will dwell in their Thoughts, and fret their galled Conſciences in Hell, World without End! Eſpecially while they conſider, how that Thouſands of glorified Saints, never had ſuch a great variety of long continued Means and Methods uſed with them, as themſelves have had, <hi>Ezek</hi> 24.13. This is the third Aggravation of the Goſpel Sinner's Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

                  <pb n="64" facs="unknown:004390_0069_100D4E26D3CAC9A8"/>
4. They will alſo remember, as what variety of Means the Lord uſed with them, ſo how, by his good Spirit, he was wont to ſtrive with them in and by the Means of Grace. How they were convinced of this and that Sin, together with the Evil and Danger of it: The Spirit of God has ſtood in their way of Diſobedience, either with the drawn Sword of ſome dreadful Threatning, or elſe with jealous Indignation, mixed with lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Compaſſion, beſeeching the tempted Soul to forbear its darling Luſt, Jer. 44.4. <hi>O do not this abominable Thing that I hate.</hi> Convicted alſo they have been of their neglect of that and the other Duty, which they ought to have attended and performed: And when the Wrath of God, revealed from Heaven, ſhall be poured out upon them, for their profaning or not calling on the Name of the Lord; then they will remember how they ſtifled Convictions, and held the Truth in Unrighteouſneſs, <hi>Jer</hi> 10.25. <hi>Rom</hi> 1.18. And Oh! they will never, never forget, how the good Spirit of God has taken them by the Hand, and led them into a Corner, to confeſs and bewail their Sins; to cry and lament after the Lord; but they have ſoon quenched all theſe good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and turned again to Folly; hardned their Hearts ſtill more and more, through the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Sin; and then more obſtinately reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Ghoſt, till there was no Remedy. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. Or elſe delaying to put their good Purpoſes in Execution till Death and Darkneſs made it too late, Joh. 9.4. <hi>The Night cometh wherein no Man can Work:</hi> And now they find and feel Blackneſs of Darkneſs,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:004390_0070_100D4E5B19BCA368"/>reſerved for them for ever; becauſe while they had the Light (not only of Scripture Revelation, but of ſpiritual Illumination, and Conviction) they walked not in the Light, but deſpiſed and rebelled againſt it, Prov. 1.23,— <hi>Turn you at my Reproof; behold, I will pour out my Spirit, &amp;c. Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed; I have ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out my Hand, and no Man regarded: But ye have ſet at nought all my Counſel, and would none of my Reproof; I alſo will laugh at your Calamity, and mick when your Fear cometh: When your Fear cometh as Deſolation, and your Deſtruction as a Whirlwind: When Diſtreſs &amp; Angusſh cometh upon you.</hi> Oh! This is a fearful Aggravation of Sin and Puniſhment, that they ſhould (not only ſhut their Ears againſt the Word, but (<hi>make their Heart as an Adamant, leſt they ſhould bear the Law; and the Words which the Lord of Hoſts hath ſent in his Spirit,</hi> Zech. 7.12. <hi>Therefore</hi> (as it follows there) <hi>came great Wrath from the Lord.</hi> Nothing can more incenſe the burning Wrath of God, than for Men to kick againſt his tender Bowels of Compaſſion and Pity. Oh! To have his loving Kindneſs abuſed; this goes to the Heart of God! Yea, it was this that alienated the Heart of God from his Covenant People of old; whom he ſometimes calls the dearly beloved of his Soul. Iſai. 63.7,— <hi>I will mention the Loving Kindneſſes of the Lord, and the Praiſes of the Lord, according to all that the Lord hath beſtowed on us, and the great Goodneſs towards the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>which he hath beſtowed on them, according to his Mercies, and according to the Multitude of his Loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: For he ſaid, Surely they are my People, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:004390_0071_100D4E285D243098"/>that will not Lie; ſo be was their Saviour. In all their Afflictions he was afflicted, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of his Preſence ſaved them: In his Love and in his Pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the Days of old: But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit; therefore he was turned to be their Enemy, and fought againſt them.</hi> And be ſure, whatever the Lord mentions in his Word, as an Aggravation of the Goſpel Sinner's inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Tranſgreſſion and Diſobedience here, ſhall come into his Mind, as an Aggravation of the juſt Recompence of his intolerable Reward here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>But here lies the Force of the Argument, we are upon; That as thoſe who die in their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, had the ſame precious Means of Grace, that, in the Almighty Spirit's Hand, proved ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to the Salvation of others; ſo they had the ſame bleſſed Spirit of Grace to ſtrive with them; but their Neck being as an Iron Sinew, and their Brow Braſs, they did wickedly and wilfully oppoſe him. Act. 7.51. <hi>Ye ſtiff necked, and uncircumciſed in Heart and Ears; ye do always reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt</hi> And hence, what bitter weeping, doleful wailing, and outragous gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Teeth will there be, among you Chriſt-deſpiſing Sinners, when you ſhall ſee your Friends and Neighbours, of the ſame Town &amp; Church, in the Kingdom of God, and you your ſelves thruſt out; for neglecting the ſame Means of Grace, rejecting the ſame Offers of Grace, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the ſame Spirit of Grace, that they wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improved, thankfully accepted, and did not always reſiſt; but ſooner or later, cheriſh and comply with.</p>
               <p>

Object. <hi>It's true, we do always reſſt the Holy Ghoſt; and always ſhall, unleſs Omnipotency take away this Reſiſtance and Enmity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Suppoſing the objector to be convinced of Sin, and in ſome Meaſure humbled out of Self; a more tender Anſwer muſt be given here, than to the blaſphemous Quareller, under the firſt <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) It's true, that the corrupt Hearts of Men do as naturally oppoſe and reſiſt the Spirit of Grace, when he comes to convince of Sin and Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Water does quench Fire. Thoſe that are now converted Saints upon Earth, and ſuch as are glorified Saints in Heaven, did once reſiſt, even as others, for a Time, yea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways did they continue reſiſting the Holy Ghoſt, till irreſiſtible Power &amp; Grace did take away this natural Reſiſtance, and ſlay this rooted Enmity of their carnal Minds againſt God and Chriſt. And even ſtill, in the Hearts of True Converts, who have Fleſh as well as Spirit, there is too much Reſiſtance remaining. 'Tis to ſuch as are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as well as others, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks, when he ſays, 1 Theſ. 5.19. <hi>Quench not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Yet, this curſed Enmity of our Hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, is altogether unreaſonable &amp; inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable: We muſt not plead for it; nor by any Means ſeek to excuſe our not ſubmitting to God, by our Enmity againſt Him. This would be, as if a Traitor ſhould plead his Hatred of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Prince, as an Excuſe for his Treaſon and Rebellion! Joh. 15.25. <hi>They hated me</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>without a Cauſe.</hi>
               </p>

(2) It's both a great Mercy and good Sign, (at leaſt of our being in a hopeful Way for a well grounded Peace) thus far to be convinced of Sin. When we come to know the Plague of our own Hearts, and come to ſee the need we have of an all-wiſe and omnipotent Phyſician, this is a good Step. We have been tampering, and trying many Ways to heal our ſelves; and ſometimes the Wound has ſeem'd to be skin'd over; but it breaks out again: Prayers &amp; Tears, Reformation and Reſolution won't do; we utterly deſpair of Relief in this Old Covenant, Self-righteous Way: And now, if it pleaſe God alſo to humble us at his Foot, under a Senſe of our utter Unworthineſs that ever ſoveraign Grace ſhould lend an helping Hand, or ſo much as caſt an Eye of Pity towards us, the preparatory Work is then wrought: The Self-condemned Sinner has nothing elſe to do, but to believe in him, who of God is made unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption.</p>
               <p>It's true, Faith alſo is the Gift of God; and the Effect of his Power; even the exceeding Greatneſs of his mighty Power, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19. But when the convinced Sinner is once brought to yield himſelf up into the Hands of divine So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty; to be diſpoſed of at God's own, meet good Will &amp; Pleaſure; then the Work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is as good as wrought: never did any ſuch Soul miſcarry. Jam. 4.6, 7 <hi>God reſiſteth the Proud; but giveth Grace to the Humble: Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves therefore to God. Humble your ſelves in his Sight, and he ſhall lift you up,</hi> ver. 10.</p>
               <p>But,</p>
               <p n="3">

(3.) Although ſinful, apoſtate Man can't over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come this contrariety of his Heart to the holy Nature and Will of God, nor of himſelf ceaſe to oppoſe him, when he comes by his Spirit to deſtroy natural &amp; righteous Self; and to create the Man a new in Chriſt Jeſus to good Works; yet the poor Rebel has Power to cry unto Him that is able to ſubdue all Things to himſelf, that he would be pleaſed, for his own Name's ſake, to pull down all the ſtrong Holds of proud Self-love, carnal Reaſon, and worldly Wiſdom: Caſting down Imaginations, and every high Thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the Knowlege of God; and bringing into Captivity every Thought, to the Obedience of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.5.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, This is the important Caſe thou want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to be reſolved in; <hi>What ſhall I do that I may wark the Works of God?</hi> Take the Reſolution thereof in Chriſt's own Words, Joh. 6.29. <hi>This is the Work of God, that ye believe in Him whom he hath ſent.</hi> Chriſt is the Author of eternal Salvation to all, and only to ſuch as thus obey him. This Obedience of Faith is a Fruit of the Spirit, now ſtriving with thee: But, <hi>My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with Man,</hi> (ſaith the Lord, Gen. 6.3) If you continue to rebel, and vex the Holy Spirit there will be no Remedy: And in Hell thou wilt remember how that Life and Death was ſet before thee; how thou waſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to choſe Life; how the Matter was urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon thee, by the miniſtry of the Word, and Motions of the Spirit: And will not this be a fearful Aggravation of thy eternal Miſery, to
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:004390_0075_100D4E2D2B993588"/>think, how that by quenching the Spirit, thou haſt kindled a Fire in God's Anger, that burns to the loweſt Hell; where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Such as periſh from under the Goſpel, ſhall find themſelves loſt and damned for ever, not becauſe they had ſinned; but becauſe they did not repent of their Sins: not ſo much for that they had broken the Law of God, as for their rejecting the Offers of Grace by Jeſus Chriſt. 'Tis true, they were conceived and born under a twofold Guilt, and ſo doubly curſed by the juſt Imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, and a depraved Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the neceſſary conſequent: But thus the whole Race of <hi>Adam</hi> died in him; and theſe as well as others ſhould have been made alive in Chriſt, had they come unto him; or be willing that he ſhould come into them. Joh. 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come unto me, that ye might have Life.</hi> Rev. 3.20 <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the Door, and knock: If any Man hear my Voice, and open the Door, I will come in to him, and ſup with him, and he with me.</hi> Their Childhood and Youth was Vanity: Many alſo of thoſe who are ſaved, forgot their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the Days of their Youth: But they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred their Redeemer before it was too late, which theſe never did; and this neglect prov'd their Ruin.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, Goſpel Sinners, lifting up their Eves in Torment, will ſee, not only <hi>Abraham. Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> but <hi>Manaſſeh, Magdalen</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Kingdom of God, and themſelves thruſt out; not becauſe they had been greater Sinners, but becauſe they were impenitent Unbelievers: and
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:004390_0076_100D4E628FFF3AE8"/>how will it tear the damned Wretch in Pieces, to conſider that his Companions in Sin, yea, ſome of the Ringleaders in Sin, did conſider and turn from all their Abominations, and were waſhed and made white in the Blood of the Lamb; which was every way ſufficient to have cleanſed him alſo from all his Sin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. Here's the Extremity of Folly, and Heighth of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! To follow a Multitude in ſinning, but never to follow any in repenting and believing: Mat. 21.31, 32 <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto them, Verily, I ſay unto you, that the Publicans and Harlots go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of God before you. For</hi> John <hi>came unto you in the way of Righteouſneſs, and ye believed him not: but the Publicans and the Harlots believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. And ye, when ye had ſeen it, repented not afterwards that ye might believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. From all the fore-going Particulars laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it follows, That when the Goſpel Sinner comes to the Place of Torment, he ſhall plainly ſee, that his Deſtruction is of himſelf: Hoſ. 13.9. O <hi>Iſrael, Thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf.</hi> Life and Death have been ſet before them; they have their own Choice. Deut. 30.15, &amp; 19. <hi>I call Heaven and Earth to Record this Day againſt you, that I have ſet before you Life and Death; Bleſſing and Curſing.</hi> They had what beſt liked them; Carnal Delights while they lived, and Hell Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment afterwards; rather than godly Sorrow with eternal Joy. 2 Tim. 3.4. <hi>Lovers of Pleaſures more than Lovers of God.</hi> Luk. 6.21, 25. <hi>Bleſſed are ye that Weep now, for ye ſhall Laugh: Wo unto you that Laugh now, for ye ſhall Mourn and Weep.</hi> They loved the mortal Poiſon of Sin (becauſe it

Prov. 8.36 <hi>He that ſinneth againſt me, wrongeth his own Soul: all they that bate me, love Death.</hi> Alas! If damned Sinners could poſſibly be ſo deceived as to perſwade themſelves, that they were, by the irreſiſtible Temptations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, neceſſitated to commit Sin; or forcibly kept back from repenting and believing the Goſpel, by God's unalterable Decree, Hell would be no Hell to them, in compariſon of what the Guilt of Self and Soul-murther will make it. They ſhall know aſſuredly, That the very Reaſon why they miſs'd of Chriſt, and Grace, and Heaven, was becauſe they loved Sin, Self and the World better. Thus the Thing is in it ſelf, and it will appear ſo to you, Goſpel impenitent Sinners, when <hi>Enoch</hi>'s Propheſy ſhall be fulfilled, Jude ver. 14, 15, 16. <hi>Behold, the Lord cometh with ten Thouſand of his Saints, to convince all that are Ungodly, of all their hard Speeches, which ungodly Sinners have ſpoken againſt him. Theſe are Murmurers, Complainers, walking after their own Luſts; and their Mouth ſpeaketh great ſwelling Words. If I had not come, and ſpoken to them, they had not had Sin: but now they have no Cloke for their Sin,</hi> Joh. 15.22.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>How ſhall the Damned ſee it to be thro' their own Default that they periſh, ſeeing they had no Power to believe unto the ſaving of their Souls. It was as poſſible for the Heathen to believe in him of whom they had not heard, as for theſe who had Preachers to believe, without the exceeding greatneſs
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:004390_0078_100D4E6457C76700"/>of the Almighty's Power, irreſiſtibly enabling them: and not being choſen to Salvation by the Father, nor of Chriſt's Sheep, for whom he laid down his Life; the Spirit was not ſent to ſanctify them; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith and Holineſs (which are both above their Power) it being impoſſible to pleaſe God here, or ſee him with Comfort hereafter: How is it the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates own Fault, that he miſſes of Heaven?</hi>

               <p>And,</p>
               <p n="1">[1] It muſt be granted, that no Sinner can come to Chriſt for Salvation, till drawn by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power, by all conquering Grace.

(1.) He knew nothing but he might be elected. It is a Thing that can't be known in this World; unleſs to ſuch as have committed the unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sin; or to others who know infallibly that ſuch an one has blaſphemed againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and done deſpite to the Spirit of Grace. The Elect are Children of Wrath by Nature, as well as others, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. And the very ſame gracious Offers, and conditional Promiſes were made to the one and the other. Chriſt did not diſſemble when he dropt thoſe compaſſionate Tears on obſtinate <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and weeping, ſaid, <hi>How often would I have gathered thy Children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as an Hen gathers her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not.</hi> If ſuch as ſhall be rejected by Chriſt the Judge, had been willing to come to Jeſus the Saviour; or but willing to open the Door and let him come into them, and had been denied any Part in him, meerly becauſe they were not elected, it were then another Caſe; but they had no Mind to come to Chriſt for Juſtification; nor that he ſhould come to ſanctify them, <hi>Job.</hi> 5.40. <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.27. The Fault is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their own; and they are without Excuſe.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Had they been perſwaded that they were elected; yet, their blind, proud, and baſe Hearts would have oppoſed an holy JESUS, a crucifyed Saviour; and rejected him with Contempt. Many of the Jews called <hi>Abraham</hi> their Father; yea, they boaſted that God was their Father; and doubted not but he had choſen them, and had ſet his Love upon them; yet could they not by any Means, no not by Miracles be perſwaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on Chriſt, <hi>Job.</hi> 8.39, 41, 47, 59, <hi>&amp;</hi> 9 13, <hi>to</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="unknown:004390_0080_100D4E66CB54AA50"/>34, <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.42 <hi>to</hi> 53. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12 37. So that it was no conceived impoſſibility of believing, becauſe they were not elected, that hindred theſe from coming to Chriſt; but their Ignorance of him, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt him; for which they muſt blame themſelves, becauſe they rejected Knowledge, and cheriſhed their malicious Envy: And both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are alike in this; they both conſpired to crucify their common Saviour, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.25, 26, 27. And both continue to oppoſe his Doctrine, 1 Cor. 1.23. <hi>We preach Chriſt crucified, to the Jews a ſtumbling Block, and to the Grecks fooliſhneſs.</hi> And even they that are ſaved, before their effectual Calling, have ſtill Hearts as wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as were the elect <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Hands, who were converted by <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.22,—So that as, neither Election it ſelf, nor the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it (if we could be ſure of it before our Calling) is ſufficient to draw us to Chriſt; ſo, neither can Reprobates plead their Non-Election, as any Excuſe for their not believing; as well on theſe two Accounts already mentioned, as in ſome other Reſpects, that may be added.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Many of them that periſh, are ſuch as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways denied and hated the Doctrine of perſonal Election from Eternity; and were for the Doctrine of Free-Will, as it ſtands in oppoſition to that of Free-Grace; holding that God deſires the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all that have the Goſpel alike; that Chriſt died for them all, one as much as another; and that the Spirit ſtrives no leſs with ſuch as finally reſiſt him, than with them that comply with his Motions, ſo as to Repent and Believe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. That ſome of my Hearers are (or at leaſt
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:004390_0081_100D4E32EC5C79D0"/>have been) of this Perſwaſion, I muſt believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have plainly told me as much; and their uneaſineſs, diſcovered in Words &amp; Actions, when the contrary Doctrines are aſſerted, is a further Demonſtration of it.</p>
               <p>It is not now my Buſineſs ſo much to confute the erroneous, as to ſatisfy the Weak, how the Doctrine of Election, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which paſſes by the greateſt Part, even of ſuch as live under the Goſpel) can ſtand with their periſhing thro' their own Default: And I have gained one Point further towards their Satisfaction, when they ſhall ſee, how that ſuch as are for univerſal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and profeſs to believe that God has given to them (and all) Power ſufficient, in the uſe of Means, to obtain Salvation; if yet they miſs of their Expectation, and be found Enemies to Chriſt at laſt, they muſt needs be ſpeechleſs, and bear the Blame of their Self-Deſtruction for ever. For what can they ſay, when the final Sentence is paſſed, why it ſhould not be executed upon them? Why did they not turn and live; ſince they boaſted of a Power to do it? Or rather, Why did they not acknowledge they had none, and go to Chriſt for it, who never rejected any that, lamenting their Ignorance, Impotence, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and utter Unworthineſs, came a begging to him for Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) It is true, ſuch as periſh were not given to Chriſt to be redeemed and ſaved; and ſo, not irreſiſtibly drawn to him. Joh. 6.37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me.</hi> But who, and what was it that drave them away from
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:004390_0082_100D4E6973400E60"/>Chriſt? Was it not their cauſeleſs Hatred of him? <hi>Job.</hi> 15.25. And what was it that drew them the quite contrary Way? Was it not their love to Sin, Self and the World? <hi>Mat</hi> 22.5, 6. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.16, <hi>to</hi> 20. 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 3.4. And what will they ſay for themſelves, when Chriſt ſhall ask them another Day, Why they did not come to him at the call of the Goſpel? Why, if they ſpeak the Truth, they muſt needs ſay, We did not Love thee: We ſaw no Form nor Comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in thee, why we ſhould deſire thee. It is true, we heard, by the Report of the Goſpel, that thou wer't fairer than the Children of Men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.2. yea, altogether lovely, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.16. But we could not think it was true. Iſai. 53.1, 2, 3 <hi>Who hath believed our Report? — He hath no Form nor Comelineſs: and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no Beauty that we ſhould deſire him. He is deſpiſed and rejected of Men; — We hid, as it were our Faces from him; He was deſpiſed, and we eſteemed him not.</hi> Why did they hate God and Chriſt? Was it becauſe they were not loved by God, and choſen in Chriſt, before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World? No; for the Elect hated the Lord before Converſion. Was it becauſe moſt of them had never ſeen Chriſt? No; Joh. 15.24. <hi>But now, have they both ſeen and hated, both me and my Father.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. <hi>Whom hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſeen, ye love.</hi> Had they any Reaſon to hate one that bled and died for his Enemies, and mourned and wept over ſuch as were implacably ſo? No; Joh. 15.25. <hi>They hated me without a Cauſe.</hi> And now, judge I pray you, betwixt Chriſt, and ſuch as deſpiſed, rejected and hated
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:004390_0083_100D4E349D192860"/>him; and preferred every Trifle, yea, their cusſed Luſts, that were Soul Murderers, before him; whither they are not juſtly condemned for loving the World as their God, and hating Chriſt worſe than they did the Devil; or Sin, which is the only Thing that makes the Devil hateful: Such then as love Sin more than Chriſt, can't be ſaid to hate him leſs than they do the Devil. Sure none will pity them, or plead for them in that Day, when they ſee what a CHRIST it was that they hated, and what hatred it was they bare him; and for what, even the holy Image of his Father, and that too it may be under a fair outſide ſhew of Love to him. Luk. 22.47,—<hi>Judas, one of the Twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to kiſs him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">(5) What, though Sinners have no Power to Repent and Believe the Goſpel, with ſuch a Faith as works by Love; yet they that periſh are without Excuſe, in that it was not only through Man's wilful Apoſtacy from God, that he came to need a Saviour (Eccl. 7.29. <hi>God made Man upright: but he hath ſought out many Inventions</hi>) which he could never oblige God to provide for him: but it is alſo the Reprobate's own Fault that he heaps up actual Tranſgreſſions of his own, for which he needs Repentance; and when he has done, he is ſo far from repenting heartily of his Sins, that he either hates to be reformed, or traiterouſly ſets up his external, partial Reformation in the Saviour's Throne. Whoſe Fault was it that <hi>Adam</hi> finned? And whence came the Sinner's corrupt Nature: that Ignorance and Enmity, which is the Root of all the Unbelief,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:004390_0084_100D4E6B97EC8AD0"/>Diſobedience and Impenitency therein, for which they are deſervedly puniſhed? Was any Violence offered to the pure Will of Man at firſt? And does not his corrupt Will act freely ſtill? Did the Creator, or any Creature force the Hands of our firſt Parents to the Tree of Knowledge; or that forbidden Fruit into their Mouths? And having loſt their original Rectitude, they could not convey it to their Poſterity. Or, is the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Law of Nature unjuſt; that every ſort of Creature ſhould propagate it's Kind, in it's own Likeneſs? <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.12, 21, <hi>to</hi> 28. compar'd with Chap. 5.3. <hi>Adam begat a Son in his own Likeneſs, after his Image: i. e.</hi> as he was a Man, and as he was a Sinner. Now, if God made Man in his own Image, after his own Likeneſs; and when he comes to judge him, he finds him in Satan's Likeneſs, with the very Image of the Devil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, <hi>Go, ye curſed, into Everlaſting Fire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> will be no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Sentence; for <hi>Iſrael</hi> hath deſtroyed himſelf firſt; and then refuſed Help through Chriſt. <hi>Reader,</hi> If thou art not found thus guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at laſt, thou ſhalt not be condemned.</p>
               <p n="6">(6) I might appeal to your own Experience, whom the Spirit has convinc'd of Sin; whether you did not ſee and know it to be your own Fault that you had finned againſt God; and doubly ſo, that you had rejected Chriſt's Authority, as your rightful Lord and King, and his Mercy, as your only Saviour from Sin and Wrath. Suppoſe, you that are effectually Called had only heard the external Sound of the Goſpel, and experienced only a common Work of the Spirit; (thus many
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:004390_0085_100D4E37E1A4DAA0"/>are called, who are not choſen, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.14) had you not periſhed through your own Default? What Thoughts had you of your ſelves, when you were under the humbling, preparatory Work of the Spirit of Bondage? Did you not plainly ſee it to be your own Fault that you had finned, and not repented? Were you not brought (tho' it may be, it was long firſt) to juſtify God if he ſhould caſt you off for ever, becauſe you had forſaken Him? Did you not acknowledge, from the bottom of your Hearts, that if God ſhould deny you his Grace, and leave you to your ſelves, he could do you no Wrong? Now, either you did wrong in thus judging your ſelves, or God does right in condemning others, that neither can nor will believe and repent; but are condemned to die, not becauſe they <hi>cannot,</hi> but becauſe they <hi>will not</hi> turn and live. Is it not juſt, that the Soul which Sins ſhould die and periſh, except he repent? And juſt it cannot be, unleſs his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and not repenting be his own Fault: Hoſ. 9.15, 17, &amp; 10 2. <hi>I hated them for the wickedneſs of their Doings. My God will caſt them away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not hearken unto him: Now ſhall they be found faulty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">(7.) <hi>Finally.</hi> If nothing elſe will ſatisfy us, let the uncontroulable, indiſputable Supremacy; the abſolute, unlimitted Sovereignty; the eſſential, ſpotleſs Righteouſneſs, and infinite Holineſs of that GOD who taketh Vengeance, ſilence all our carnal Reaſonings; and ſet us down ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with what the Scriptures of Truth inform us concerning this Matter. Now, it is evident by the Word of God, that all impenient Unbelievers
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:004390_0086_100D4E6D5C73E7B0"/>ſhall be damned, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.3. It is alſo clear, that no Sinner can believe to the ſaving of his Soul, except almighty Power draw him to Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19, 20. Nor does the Spirit of God thus irreſiſtibly work Faith in any, but ſuch as were given to Chriſt, and ordained to eternal Life, thro' him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.16, 26. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48. Yet, that the Unbeliever, obſtinately refuſing the only Remedy; and God being no ways obliged to overcome this obſtinacy, is guilty of his own Death; and muſt blame himſelf that he periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his Sins, is what the Scriptures alſo do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly aſſert; either more directly, or by neceſſary Conſequence: Joh. 3.19. <hi>This is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the World, and Men love Darkneſs rather than Light.</hi> Prov. 8.36. <hi>He that ſinneth againſt me, wrongeth his own Soul; all they that hate me, love Death.</hi> Joh. 15.22. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken unto them, they had not had Sin, but now they have no Cloke for their Sin.</hi> Mat. 22.11, 12, to 15. <hi>And when the King came in to ſee the Gueſts, he ſaw there a Man which had not on a wedding Garment: And he ſaith unto him, Friend, How cameſt thou in hither, not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a wedding Garment? And he was ſpeechleſs. Them ſaid the King to the Servants, Bind him Hand and Foot, and take him away; and caſt him into outer Darkneſs; there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth: For many are called; but few are choſen.</hi> The whole World of Reprobates ſhall be like this Man: their Mouths ſhall be ſtop'd: Rom. 3.19. <hi>That every Mouth may be ſtopped; and all the World become guilty before God:</hi> If God hath ſaid it, tho' Man may contradict it; <hi>Let God be true; but
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:004390_0087_100D4E396BC01A90"/>every Man a Liar; as it is written, That thou mighteſt be juſtified in thy ſayings; and overcome when thou art judged,</hi> Rom. 3.4.</p>
               <p>There be many hard Speeches, uttered againſt Chriſt's Ambaſſadors, while they ſhun not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the whole Counſel of God, which will at laſt be found to have been ſpoken, by ungodly Sinners againſt CHRIST; who will, very ſhortly, make good <hi>Enoch</hi>'s Propheſy, Jude ver. 10.14, 15. <hi>But theſe ſpeak Evil of thoſe Things which they know not,—And</hi> Enoch <hi>alſo, the ſeventh from</hi> Adam, <hi>propheſied of theſe, ſaying; Behold, the Lord cometh with ten Thouſands of his Saints, to execute Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon all; and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly Deeds, which they have ungodly committed; and of all their hard Speeches, which ungodly Sinners have ſpoken againſt him.</hi> What, though we can't anſwer Objections ſo as to ſtop others Mouths; nor to the ſilenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our own carnal Reaſonings, and vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Temptations, for the preſent; let us leave that Work to Chriſt; in whom are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowlege; and in the mean time, hold we cloſe to this, and be ſure we keep our hold-faſt, that the Word of God is true, the Judge of all the Earth will do right; the fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer than Men: His Judgments are a great Deep! which the ſhort Line of humane Reaſon can never ſound: What then can be more reaſonable, than that our Reaſon ſhould be brought into Captivity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dominion of Faith; 'till Faith ſhall be ſwallowed up in Viſion? And then we ſhall know as much of theſe Things as we can deſire
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:004390_0088_100D4E6FA1C52828"/>to know; even to full &amp; everlaſting Satisfaction. Indeed, if we could now or then comprehend fully the eternal Counſels of him whoſe Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is infinite, they would not be worthy of GOD, only Wiſe: Nor are the Doctrines of God's Sovereignty, and Man's Impotency; Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Election, and Free Grace, to be at all ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, becauſe many wiſe Men after the Fleſh, and moſt wicked Men, not having the Spirit, do oppoſe them: On the other Hand; <q>It is an Effect of Election (ſaith Mr. <hi>Norton</hi>) to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Decree of Election. As God openeth himſelf in no Truth more than this; ſo they that love to ſee the ſhining Face of God in Chriſt, delight in no Truth more than this.</q> In this Way, the Riches of Free Grace are glorified to the uttermoſt; and the poor trembling Believer's Salvation is ſecured infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, abundantly! Whereas, even <hi>Adam</hi> in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, (with all his large Stock of Grace, tho' he had no inward Luſt to entice and draw him away) being left to himſelf ſoon fell; and Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Angels in Heaven, not being elected (as thoſe that ſtood are ſaid to be, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.21.) left their own Habitation, even without a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And yet the poor ſelf conceited Wretch, that knows nothing of the Breadth and Rigour of the Law, or the Riches of Free Grace in the Goſpel; nothing of God, or himſelf, or any Thing elſe as he ought to know; when he hears the Doctrine of Election preached, either quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels at it, or is diſcouraged if he gives any Credit to it. It ſeems to ſtand in the Way of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: Oh! If it were not for this Doctrine,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:004390_0089_100D4E3AF7DCCBE8"/>(thinks the proud ſelf Juſticiary) I ſhould do well enough: Whereas, all the grounded Hope thou can it have, is from this Doctrine. Were there not a Remnant according to the Election of Grace, God's <hi>Iſrael,</hi> all <hi>New-England,</hi> yea, and the whole Goſpel World would have been like <hi>Sodom,</hi> and like unto <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> not one Soul would have been ſaved, any more than the fallen Angels. So that not only the Believer, but the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Sinner has cauſe to bleſs God for Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which refuſes not any on the Account of Weakneſs or Vileneſs. If then thou ſeeſt thy ſelf as unable to believe as a dead Man to riſe and walk; and as unworthy that Chriſt ſhould give thee Life, as are the very Devils; venture all on this Bottom; Chriſt has not excepted me, in the general Invitations of the Goſpel; <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will, let him take of the Water of Life freely,</hi> Rev. 22.17. Nor may I excuſe my ſelf from obeying the Command of God, 1 John 3.23. <hi>This is his Commandment, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And tho' I have a natural, ſtrong, rooted Averſeneſs and Enmity, as well as Impotency, that keeps me from oſing the only Remedy; yet, GOD can make me willing in the Day of his Power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. And, if the Eye of electing Love ſhall pity me, and the Hand of irreſiſtable Power ſhall draw me, I ſhall be an eternal Monument of free Grace: Nor will I dare to ſit ſtill and cry, <hi>God help me,</hi> any more than to riſe up in my own Strength; but wait in the Uſe of all Means of Grace, avoiding all the Occaſions of Sin; and if
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:004390_0090_100D4E71AEEEFBF0"/>I periſh, I periſh juſtly; if I am ſaved, 'twill be a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful Salvation!</p>
               <p>Let the Enemies of this Doctrine themſelves be Judges, whether this be not a more likely Way to obtain the Favour of God, than their Way of contradicting, quarrelling, objecting; or abuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrine unto a ſlothful Neglect of the Means; a profane Courſe of Life, and deſperate Way of Sinning; if they are elected they ſhall be ſaved, do what they will; if not, they ſhall be damned, do what they can.

               <p>But, to return from this Digreſſion (which may poſſibly, meet with ſome loſt Sheep, that muſt be bro't in:) The Objection I am anſwering (which fell in our Way, as we were arguing the Truth of the ſecond Doctrine, from a ſixth Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> That when the Goſpel-Sinner comes to the Place of Torment, he ſhall ſee and know that his Deſtruction is of himſelf; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Apprehenſions he ſhall have of the Saints Happineſs in Heaven, will the more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aggravate his own eternal Miſery:) I ſay, the Objection pleads that the Reprobate is not guilty of Self-Deſtruction, becauſe not elected, redeemed and ſanctified by the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: but having found him guilty before God, by clear Scripture Evidence; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that may be pleaded in his Behalf;
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:004390_0091_100D4E3EA9175538"/>we re-aſſume our former Argument, and cloſe the ſixth Conſideration, that we may paſs to the Seventh: And do Goſpel Sinners indeed pull down everlaſting Deſtruction upon their own Heads? What Tongue then can expreſs, or Heart conceive, the leaſt Part of that Soul-killing Rage againſt themſelves, that ſelf-tormenting Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that muſt needs eternally poſſeſs their Souls in Hell; while they ſhall behold all thoſe, who took a wiſer Courſe, in the Kingdom of God, and themſelves thruſt out, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to enter in: Here I am, (and ſhall be, for as many Millions of Ages as there were Minutes from the Creation to the Reſurrection; and when that is paſt, ten Hundred Thouſand Million Times more will remain behind;) Here I am, torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Flame; ſeventy Times ſeven fold hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s fiery Furnace; and I wilfully threw my ſelf into this boiling Lake of Fire and Brimſtone; O cruelly wounding Tho't! Reader, think not any Pains too much by which thou mayſt eſcape theſe cruel Laſhes of a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tormenting Conſcience!</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>And laſtly,</hi> Such as have once had the Price of the Goſpel in their Hands; but had no Heart to improve it, ſhall for ever remember in Hell, how they ſold their immortal Souls, and eternal Joys, for vaniſhing Trifles; empty Nothings!</p>
               <p>How did it vex <hi>Eſau,</hi> when he had ſwallowed down and digeſted a few Spoonfuls of Pottage, to think that his Birth-right was gone, (and the Bleſſing muſt go after it) Heb. 12.16. <hi>Leſt there be any Fornicator, or profane Perſon, as</hi> Eſau, <hi>who for one Morſel of Meat ſold his Birth-right; For,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:004390_0092_100D4E745E6F5608"/>ye know, how that afterwards, when he would have inherited the Bleſſing, he was rejected, and found us Place for Repentance, though be ſought it carefully with Tears.</hi> Gen. 27.34. <hi>And</hi> Eſau <hi>cried with a great and exceeding bitter Cry, and ſaid unto his Father; bleſs me, even me alſo, O my Father. And</hi> Eſau <hi>lift up his Voice and wept,</hi> ver. 38.</p>
               <p>So will the damned Goſpel-Deſpiſers weep and wail, and gnaſh their Teeth, while they conſider what they had in Exchange for thoſe Rivers of Pleaſure, that flow at God's right Hand for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore; even a little bitter ſweet Pleaſure; for an Inch of Time; a thin Bubble of worldly Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; ſmall, inconſiderable, unſatisfying, unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Gains: As that Prince, who, in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity ſold a Kingdom for one Draught of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; lamenting, ſighing, and too late repenting, ſaid, For how ſhort a Pleaſure have I ſold a Kingdom! Men will ſay, I have been fool'd out of ſo much Land, Money, Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and never ſo much as drank for it. And what have poor loſt Souls now to ſhew for a fair Inheritance above the Stars; which they ſold for a Song? How inconſiderable a Part of this inconſiderable World had they; and for how ſmall a Moment did they enjoy this Dream of a Shadow, at the Price of their Souls? Whereas, if they could have graſped and held Poſſeſſion of the whole World, from the Beginning to the End of Time, on ſuch Terms; it had been a loſing Bargain; an undoing Bargain! Mat. 16.26. <hi>For what is a Man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul? Or, what ſhall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</hi>
               </p>

If a Man parts with a rich Commodity, or a large Inheritance, for a valuable Conſideration; though he ſhould ſomething under ſell, it does not much trouble him: Or if he loſes a good Bargain, he keeps his Money, and that comforts him: But if he ſhould in a mad Fit, ſell firſt his Houſe and Land, and then his Wife and Children into perpetual Slavery; and all for a Whiſtle and a Rattle, a guilded Box and a gay Picture; would it not vex his Soul to Death, when he ſhould come to himſelf, and ſolemnly reflect on what he had done? Yet this were a tolerable good Bargain, in Compariſon of what is made by many Goſpel Sinners among us: And whether you believe it or not, ſure we are that damned Souls in Hell do know, that the Heighth of their extream Folly has been above all Compariſon; and their eternal Vexation of Soul ſhall be proportionable. Such a Time I was tempted by the Pleaſure of Sin, and at another Time the Hook was baited with Gain; but my Conſcience told me it was Sin, the Wages of which is Death; and the Word of God informed me, that they which do ſuch Things ſhall anot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God; yet, I did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear; and now Heaven is gone, and I die like a Fool!— Theſe will be intolerable Thoughts! And yet ſuch as periſh from under the Goſpel muſt dwell with ſuch Thoughts, for ever and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Oh! that Men were wiſe, to prevent this in Time. Thus much for the <hi>Second General Head</hi> of our Diſcourſe, under the <hi>Second Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</hi>

III. We might in the third and laſt Place, yet more particularly make mention of ſeveral Sorts of Goſpel Sinners, whoſe eternal Miſery ſhall be peculiarly aggravated; not only above that of the Heathen, but above the Puniſhment of many of their Fellow-Goſpel Sinners; As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as have lived in Times and Places when and where many have been converted; Churches greatly inlarged; Multitudes flocking after Chriſt; Sinners of all ſorts and ſizes repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and believing the Goſpel, Mat. 21.32. <hi>John came unto you in the Way of Righteouſneſs, and ye believed him not; but the Publicans and Harlots be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him: and ye, when ye had ſeen it, repented not afterwards, that ye might believe him.</hi> Many of their Acquaintance, of the ſame Town, in the near Neighbourhood; ſome of the ſame Knot of Good-Fellowſhip, (as they ſay) their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Sin, it may be out of the ſame Family, have turned to the Lord; yea, out of the ſame Bed one has been taken and the other left: A Yoke-Fellow, a Brother or Siſter, a Parent or Child has been perſwaded to enter in at the ſtrait Gate; and then by earneſt Intreaties and good Inſtructions, or at leaſt a convincing, winning Example, they have ſought to draw you with them, in the Way Everlaſting; but you would not hearken; therefore an infinite Evil muſt come upon you. And when you ſhall hear many Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Sinners pleading, that tho' Religion was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd where they lived, yet it was little practic'd; and if ſomething of the Form was kept up, yet the Power of Godlineſs was derided by the moſt;
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:004390_0095_100D4E425F7CC2B0"/>and what Hazzards they muſt have run if they had followed the Lord fully! You ſhall then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that though you might have advantag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Reputation with your Neighbours, by denying all Ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts, and by living Soberly, Righteouſly and Godly; and though you were often aſhamed to be found in bad Company, and it was a Diſcredit to you to turn your Back on the Lord's-Table; and more ſo to be looſe and vain in your Converſations, and hard in your Dealings, notwithſtanding your Profeſſion; yet, neither Duty nor Intereſt, no, not the temporal, ſpiritual and eternal Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that were on Religion's Side, could prevail with you to profeſs and practiſe as holy Souls did: It therefore remains, that you chew ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly on this bitter Pill; which, if it were poſſible for your own Conſciences to forget, we may ſuppoſe Millious of Goſpel Sinners to caſt in your Teeth, and ſay, If we had had half the Encouragements to an holy Life, that others were ſurrounded with, we would never have been ſo fond of Damnation, as to have croſſed even our worldly Intereſt in purſuing it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as have had ſingular Advantages above others, and that many Ways: by their Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Days of their Youth: they have been trained up in the Way they ſhould go; many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Prayers made with them and for them, in the Family; beſides ten Thouſand Petitions put up for them by a pious Father, a gracious Mother, in ſecret Places; who have alſo, all the Time of their Childhood and Youth, been dropping ſweet and ſolemn Words of Council and Warning into
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:004390_0096_100D4E77B8212FB8"/>their Ears; as holy <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Bathſheha</hi> did by young <hi>Solomon,</hi> as himſelf tells us, Prov. 4.1, 2. — <hi>Hear, ye Children, the Inſtruction of a Father; and attend to know Underſtanding: For I give you good Doctrine, forſake you not my Law. For, I was my Father's Son; tender and only beloved in the ſight of my Mother. He taught me alſo, and ſaid unto me, Let thy Heart retain my Words: Keep my Commandments and live. Get Wiſdom, get Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; forget it not; neither decline from the Words of my Mouth. Wiſdom is the principal Thing; therefore get Wiſdom; and with all thy get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings get Underſtanding.</hi> And ver. 13, 14, 15. <hi>Take faſt hold of Inſtruction, let her not go; keep her, for ſhe is thy Life. Enter not into the Path of the Wicked; and go not in the Way of evil Men-Avoid it, paſs not by it, turn from it, and paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Put away from thee a froward Mouth, and perverſe Lips put far from thee,</hi> ver. 24. Oh! 'Tis an unſpeakable Advantage to have a pious Education, holy Examples, good Books, all imaginable Helps, in our tender Years, and after we are grown up: And yet theſe priviledged Souls, who have had all manner of Helps and precious Means, in publick and private, ſhall ſee ſome, who have been under all Kinds of Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and Hindrances, in the Kingdom of God, and themſelves thruſt out; but it will kill their Hearts. So much for the ſecond Sort.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such as have had many Convictions, ſtrong Terrors, good Purpoſes, promiſing Beginnings; but their Goodneſs has quickly vaniſhed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared, like the Morning Cloud and early Dew, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.4. Theſe ſhall come to a fearful End;
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:004390_0097_100D4E43EFEFF518"/>unleſs it pleaſe the Lord to move again upon their Hearts, and give them an Heart to comply with thoſe Motions, 2 Pet 2.20, 21, 22. <hi>For of after they have eſcaped the Pollutions of the World, through the Knowlege of the Lord and Savicur, Jeſus Chriſt, they are again intangled therein, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; the latter End is worſe with them than the Beginning. For it bad been better fir them not to have known the Way of Righteouſneſs, than after they have known it to turn from the holy Commandment, delivered unto them. But it is hapned unto them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true Proverb; The Dog is turned to his own V mit again; and the Sow that was waſhed, to her wallowing in the Mire.</hi> And as this Relapſe aggravates their Sin, ſo their Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be doubly aggravated; That they ſhould begin well, and be almoſt peſwaded, and yet fall off and fall back,—and then that they ſhould ſin worſe than ever before; at leaſt in this Reſpect worſe, becauſe greater Mercy is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed; more Light ſinned againſt; Job 24.13. <hi>They are of thoſe that rebel againſt the Light:</hi> But they ſhall never forget how near they once were to the Kingdom of God, <hi>Mark</hi> 12.34. From whence they are, notwithſtanding, fallen into the Bottomleſs Pit; and, how great is their Fall! How much deeper are they fallen than others, who were never liſted up ſo high! How much better had it been for them not to have had this internal Knowledge, by the Spirit's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and Illumination, added to their more common Knowledge by Reading, Hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unleſs they had better improved it? 'Tis a
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:004390_0098_100D4E7AF0115028"/>dreadful Thing to increaſe Knowledge only to the increaſing of eternal Sorrow.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

That many ſuch ſhall go to Hell, is a no leſs certain than ſad and awful Truth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.21, 22. and 8.11, 12. and 25.10, 11, 12. But we needed to have looked no further than the Verſes immediately preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Text, for the Confirmation of this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Truth, Luke 13.26, 27. <hi>Then ſhall ye</hi> (and others like them, in after Times) <hi>begin to ſay, We have eaten and drunk in thy Preſence, and thou baſt taught in our Streets. But be ſhall ſay, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are: Depart from me all ye Workers of Iniquity.</hi> That the profeſſed Followers of an holy JESUS and Pretenders to the ſtricteſt Piety ſhould be found the Devil's Children, and Workers of Iniquity, is not more abſurd and impious, than their Condemnation will be juſt, and their Puniſhment intolerably ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated: Not becauſe they made ſo high a Profeſſion; but that they aimed no higher than Self in it. They abuſe the richeſt Favours that are capable of being abaſed to the Subject's Ruin. They have violated the ſtrongeſt Engagements that ſuch unſanctified Wretches could be brought under. And perhaps too, they have cloaked their ſelfiſh, worldly, helliſh Deſigns with religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pretences: <q>As if one ſhould ſtop an Oven with a King's Robes.</q> And ſhall not their Shame before the World, and Suffering in the Place of Torment, bear a juſt Proportion to their
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:004390_0099_100D7CE029F91248"/>Iniquity and Hypocriſy? This is the Man (it will be known to all) that made not GOD his Hope and Strength; but boaſted in the Height of his Privileges, and truſted in the abundance of his Sacrifices: The Righteous ſhall laugh at him, <hi>Pſal</hi> 52.6. And the very Devils will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him. Yea, ſuch of his Acquaintance in the World as never pertended to ſuch high Things in Religion (tho' they muſt be damned, not only becauſe they did not believe with their Hearts, but becauſe they did not confeſs with their Mouths too; both being our indiſpenſible Duty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10.) yet may taunt at theſe Hypocrites. But the worſt is, GOD has allotted them one of the hotteſt Rooms in Hell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. <hi>ult.</hi> Where their own Conſciences will for ever ſting their Souls with the Remembrance of how much they promiſed, and how little they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. How publickly and ſolemnly they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Fleſh, the World and the Devil; and yet, at leaſt more hiddenly, either in Words and Actions, or, be ſure, in Heart and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did follow what they had call'd Heaven to witneſs of their abandoning. What, for ſuch as have full often drunk of the Cup of the Lord; the Cup of Bleſſing; the Cup which Chriſt calls the New Teſtament in his Blood; inſtead of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to drink of the new Wine with Chriſt in his Father's Kingdom, to have the Cup of Fury and Indignation, Trembling and Aſtoniſhment forced into their Hands; full of the Wine of divine Wrath, even the fierceneſs of his Wrath, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Mixture of Mercy; and to be made to drink it up, Dregs and all; (for the very Dregs
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:004390_0100_100D7B3823913D68"/>of God's Fury are wrung into this Cup) tho' it be Eternity to the Bottom, they muſt drink it off! But they had better have profeſſed leſs; or rather more truly, and have practiſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Such as have contemned, maligned and moſt uncharitably cenſured the precious Saints of GOD, and meek Followers of JESUS, on account of their natural and moral Infirmities, real or ſuppoſed; or elſe becauſe of the outward Meanneſs of their Condition in the World; yea, very likely, for their real Piety, Integrity and conſcientious Walking; but always under Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſomething elſe. Now theſe are of three Sorts;
<list>
                     <item>(1) Profligate Wretches, who, like <hi>Cain,</hi> bear a deadly Hatred againſt the Faithful in Chriſt Jeſus, even becauſe their own Works are evil, and the Believer's righteous; 1 Joh. 3.12, 13. <hi>Not as</hi> Cain, <hi>who was of that Wicked-One, and ſlew his Brother; and wherefore ſlew be him?

They oft try themſelves and are as oft acquitted by falſe Signs, or true ones miſapplyed. They are well thought of by others like themſelves, and even admired by ſome true Chriſtians; yea, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd poſſibly, by ſuch as are diſcerning Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and by Miniſters; and they know it, and this s;eals their Deluſion, and raiſes their Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to a great Height: So that they may be wonderfully conſident of being own'd by CHRIST himſelf, whoſe flaming Eye will diſcover them to themſelves and the World, to their unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Shame, and more dreadful Diſappointment. The higher they were raiſed by GOD, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Gifts of the Spirit; by Men, in charitable Expreſſions, and real Affection, thro' miſtake; and by themſelves, through Satan's ſtrong De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, in glorious Expectations, the deeper will they fall. Stand ſtill, <hi>Reader,</hi> pauſe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, —and think (what Words can't expreſs) of the Dreadfulneſs of ſuch a Diſappointment!</p>
               <p n="7">7. Such as heave had the Unſoundneſs of their Hopes for Heaven, again and again, plainly diſcovered; inſomuch that their falſe Peace has been greatly diſturbed; and at Times, they have been even convinced that their State and Condition was bad; that they were yet in the Gall of Bitterneſs and in the Bonds of Iniquity; that another Manner of Work muſt paſs on them, or they periſh for ever. Yet, for all this, like
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:004390_0106_100D7B5B9F8B7C38"/>fool-hardy Wretches, they have ſhut their Eyes againſt this Light of Conviction, (that might have prov'd the Dawning of ſound Converſion, and eternal Salvation to them;) and ventured on over the Precipice, chuſing the Terrors of the Second-Death, rather than the Pangs of the New-Birth; and to be at the Coſt of laying a new Foundation. Sometimes they have thought they would let go their falſe Hold; but then, finding themſelves deſtitute of any Footing, fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſinking, and fearing they ſhould be daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Pices or drowned, they muſt catch hold of ſomething; ſome where they muſt faſten; Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair is dreadful! And being ignorant of the Way of Salvation, by believing in him that juſtifies the Ungodly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. (which indeed is a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, hidden from the greateſt Part of Profeſſors) they muſt (I ſay) catch hold ſome where, as drowning Men; and the rotten Stick of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Performances is what comes next to Hand, and they can reach no further: If they think, now they will come off from Self and Duties, and lean on CHRIST only, 'tis with a Faith of their own forging; they do but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the old Houſe, which muſt be pulled down to the Ground, and removed, every Stick of it, and the Foundation ripped up, that they may be created a new, in Chriſt Jeſs to good Works: founded on him, and built up in him: But, Oh! how averſe are our old Covenant Hearts from this new and living Way, when opened in the Goſpel! Salvation by Works, a Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to work for Wages and earn Heaven, was the firſt Liquor that was put into the Veſſel of
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:004390_0107_100D7B5D4E505A38"/>humane Nature and it ſtrongly ſavours of it to this Day; according to the true Proverb, <hi>That which is bred in the Bone, will never out of the Fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, I have diverted a little, to ſhew you one main Cauſe of that extreme Difficulty Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters find, in removing Men from their old, falſe Foundations: And when they have done all, Multitudes will hold faſt their own Self-Deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. They will put new Patches on the old, ragged Garment; they will ſeem to mend their Pace; but 'tis in the old, broad, beaten Path. Yea (to retun) they will ſhut their Eyes (as was ſaid) againſt the plaineſt Conviction; and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on in a Way, they are ſo oft and faithfully told, will end in their ſhameful and intolerable Diſappointment.</p>
               <p>Thus the Damned in Hell, eſpecially ſuch as periſh from under the Goſpel, and peculiarly ſome Sorts of Goſpel Sinners that have been mentioned, ſhall have ſuch Apprehenſions of the Saints Happineſs in Heaven, as will dreadfully aggravate their own eternal Miſery.</p>

Hence, Places of Goſpel-Light are dear Places to ſin in. The Wages of Sin (even of all Kinds of Sin, of each ſingle Act in any Kind) is Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23.

So that none of the ungoſpellized World can ſin at a cheap Rate: The Wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, and all the Nations that forget God, <hi>Pſal</hi> 17.9. Yet, <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Seed of <hi>Jacob</hi> whom God loved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had his Word nad Ordinances, which other Nations had not; becauſe they only, of all the Families of the Earth, were thus highly privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, thus nearly related to God; their Sins
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:004390_0112_100D7B7D95B651B0"/>were the more grievous; Amos 2.13. <hi>Behold, I am preſſed under you, as a Cart is preſſed that is full of Sheaves,</hi> Iſa. 1.2, 14. <hi>I have nouriſhed and brought up Children, and they have rebelled againſt me.

               <p>Theſe are hard Leſſons! But if we be ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, unmoveable, always abounding in the Work of the Lord; we know that our Labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord. If we ſuffer with him, we ſhall be glorified together. He that overcomes, ſhall ſit down with Chriſt, on his Throne; as he alſo overcame, and is ſet down with his Father, on his Throne. Suppoſe the worſt, that it ſhould come to Burning at the Stake; that's better than burning for ever in Hell. Should the World that hates us, gnaſh on us with their Teeth, and ſtone us to Death; this is not half ſo bad as what is expreſſed in our Text, <hi>There ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth, when ye ſhall ſee</hi> Abraham, &amp;c. <hi>in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and you your ſelves thruſt out.</hi>

Not that they ſhall rejoyce in that Miſery of their Fellow-Creatures which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have deſerved as well and as much, and many of them more than moſt of the Damned:
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:004390_0114_100D7B80E31819B0"/>But this ſhall be their Rejoycing, that they are delivered from ſo great a Death as the ſecond Death is, Rev. 21.8. <hi>compar'd with</hi> I Cor. 6.9, 10, 11. <hi>But the Fearful, and Unbelieving, and the Abominable, and Murderers, and Whoremongers, and Sorcerers, and Idolaters, and all Liars, ſhall have their Part in the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimſtone; which is the ſecond Death. Know ye not that the Unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived: Neither For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate, nor Abuſers of themſelves with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners, ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God: And ſuch were ſome of you; but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> And ſhall we not for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, when we come to the Region of Light and Bliſs, how far we ran in Sin; how long we played on the Brink of Heil; and how loth we were at laſt to be ſaved in GOD's Way? Though he had ſent his Son to endure his burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wrath for us; and did ſend his Spirit to pluck us as Brands out of the Fire; while Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes were left to periſh for lack of Viſion: and moſt, who had the Light, were left, in their Blindneſs, to love Darkneſs rather than Light; and are therefore juſtly condemned to Blackneſs of Darkneſs for ever; becauſe they hated the Light of Truth and Grace, they ſhall never ſee the Light of Glory; unleſs with ſuch Apprehenſions, Flaſhing in their Minds, as make Hell the darker and hotter.</p>

So, on the other Hand, (as we are arguing) the black Night of eternal Death makes the perfect Day to ſhine the brighter. The Howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Dogs which are without, (Rev. 22.15) makes the Hallelujahs of Saints, the Songs of <hi>Ston</hi> to be the more Joyful &amp; Melodious. If there were no Hell; or none but Devils in it; or but few of the Children of Men, and thoſe only ſuch as had been the leaſt of Mortals, or greateſt of Sinners; Heaven would be the leſs Glorious; and its high Arches would not have rung ſo loud and ſweetly of SALVATION! SALVATION! <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.10 &amp; 19.1. Neither would there have been room for that new Song, Rev. 5.9. At leaſt the Tune of it muſt have been ſet lower; <hi>And they ſong a new Song, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Thou art worthy, — for thou waſt ſlain; and baſt redeemed us to GOD, by the Blood, out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation.</hi> And they ſhall rejoyce alſo, unconceivably, and be glad with exceeding Joy, in the Triumphs of divine Juſtice, when they ſhall ſee the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, <hi>Pſal</hi> 58.9, 10. Themſelves are by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of Grace wonderfully delivered, which will be freſh and new to Eternity; becauſe the Smoke of Hell's Torment will aſcend (as it were in their Sight) for ever and ever: And GOD's Power, Juſtice and Truth are glorified to the Height; and therefore they rejoyce; Rev. 18.20 and 19 1, 2 — <hi>Rejoyce over her, thou Heaven, and ye holy Apoſtles and Prophets; for GOD hath aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy a on her. After theſe Things I heard a great Voice of much People in Heaven, ſaying, Alleluia; Salvation, and Honour, and Glory, and Power to
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:004390_0116_100D7B87D78F3830"/>the LORD our GOD: For true and righteous are his Judgments. And again they ſaid Halleluia; and her Smoke roſe up for ever and ever. And a Voice came out of the Throne, ſaying, Praiſe our GOD, all ye his Servants, and ye that fear him, both Small and Great: Let us be glad and rejoyce, and give Honour to him.</hi>

                  <item>2 The final Determination of your eternal State may be much nearer than you ſuſpect or imagine. As it is appointed unto Men once to die, but after this the Judgment: So are his Days determined; the Number of his Months are with the Lord, who has appointed his Bounds that he cannot paſs, <hi>Job.</hi> 14.5. And as the
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:004390_0117_100D7B8A48030A68"/>Tree falls, ſo muſt it lie. If thy Soul ſhould this Night be required of thee; and thou diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt not thy Condition before thou ſleepeſt; thou mayſt be undone for ever by thy preſent Delay. <hi>Where is the Hope of the Hypocrite, tho' he hath gained, when God taketh away his Soul?

For want of a thorough Search, Multitudes are miſtaken, on one Hand or the other; and on both Hands Miſtakes are ſad, tho' not alike dangerous, and of dreadful Conſequence. <hi>There is that maketh himſelf rich, yet hath Nothing: there is that maketh himſelf poor, yet hath great Riches,</hi> Prov. 13.7. How ſadly do many Chriſtians walk, to their own Diſcomfort, and the Diſcouragement of others, and the LORD's Diſhonour, in whom they ſhould always rejoyce; How are their Hands weakned in the Service of God; when the Joy of the Lord would be their Strength? <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.10. And all for want of diſcovering the Sincerity of their Hearts; which they might do, by divine Aſſiſtance, in one Hour's diligent ſearch into their Hearts; and how cheap a Remedy is this for Months and whole Years of Darkneſs, and cruel Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of the Love of Chriſt; their's to him, or his to them? <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6.

4. It may be of unſpeakable Advantage to know our preſent State of Soul, whether it be good or bad. If, after the moſt laborious and critical Search, we find a Grain of true Grace, we ſhall have more Cauſe of Joy, than if we had found a Wedge of Gold; Prov. 3.13, 14, 15. <hi>Happy is the Man that findeth Wiſdom, (i. e.</hi> true ſaving Grace) <hi>For the Merchandize of it is better than the Merchandize of Silver, and the Gain thereof than fine Gold: It is more precious than Rubies; and all the Things thou canſt deſire cannot be compared to it.</hi> And if, on Trial, our preſent State appear to be unſound, we have then the moſt happy Seaſon, perhaps, that ever we had in our Life Time, to make our ſelves for ever: For, what is it that undoes a great Part of thoſe who periſh from under the Goſpel, but a falſe Hope? <hi>Job</hi> 27.8. What is the Hope of the Hypocrite, tho' he hath gained, when God taketh away his Soul?

5. Your Unwillingneſs to know the worſt of your ſelves, and to come to the ſtricteſt Trial in order thereto, will render any further Tryal the leſs needful; and your Willingneſs to be ſearch'd to the Bottom, will make ſuch a Work the more eaſy. I ſay not that every one who is backward to examine himſelf is therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound: The Fleſh draws back from all ſpiritual Duties: And it may be the weak and tempted Soul has tried and tried again, has been ſo long and often at the Work of Self-Examination, and ſtill unreſolved, that it is quite diſheartned; yet can pray with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 139.23. <hi>Search me, O God, and know my Heart.</hi> If there were a Man a thouſand Miles off that could tell the doubting Chriſtian his State, infallibly, he would not think the Journey long, to be reſolv'd in a Caſe that lies neareſt his Heart of any Thing in the World. Nor can we ſay that every one who is willing to be tried is therefore upright of Heart; for many have a ſtrong Confidence of their good Eſtate, though groundleſs; now, theſe, reſolving what to judge before Hand, may boldly come to the Trial. And then, the Spirit of Conviction can make an elect Soul (at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent on a falſe Foundation) willing to come to the Trial, in order to his Converſion and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. But ordinarily, ſuch as are willing to be ſearch'd, eſpecially when they moſt ſuſpect themſelves, are honeſt hearted; and ſuch as don't love the moſt ſearching Books and Sermons are naught. If you ſaw the Merchant loth you ſhould view and try his Wares, would you not ſuſpect them the more? <hi>Every one that doth

Our firſt and ſudden Thoughts, in any difficult Matter, are very often wrong. <hi>He that anſwereth a Matter before be heareth it,</hi> (ſaith the wiſe Man) <hi>it ſhall be Shame and Folly to him.</hi> It may be Death and Damnation in the Caſe now before us. We muſt hear both Sides, and hear all, before we can judge in the trivial Matters of this Life; how much more when the State of the Soul is to be judged, where a Miſtake may coſt us as much more than our Lives are worth as our Life is more than a Button of our Coat. Have we a Mark of a good State given in a Sermon? We muſt keep it in Mind, recollect it in private, and diligently compare our ſelves with it: Have we a Sign of Grace in a Book before our Eyes? Let us read it over and over; pondering every Part of it in our Hearts; conſidering where the main Strength of the Sign lies. As now, to give an Example for the Help of the Weak: We have an infallible Mark of a good State in 1 John 3.14. <hi>We know that we are paſſed from Death to Life, becauſe we love the Brethren.</hi> When I try my State by this Mark, it's none of my Buſineſs to enquire, How I ſhall infalllibly know who are Chriſt's Diſciples indeed: It's enough that I know who I am bound in Charity to look on as gracious Perſons: The main Thing that I am to inquire after is, Whither I do indeed love ſuch as I regularly look on to be the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of GOD, becauſe of the Image of the holy GOD, that I do, as it were, ſee upon him?
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:004390_0123_100D7B98583BA8B8"/>Whether the real Ground of my Love to Chriſt's Diſciples be this; That they love Chriſt, and Chriſt loves them; and whether the more Chriſt like they are, the more dearly I affect them? and whither upon new, and further, and clearer Diſcoveries of their experimental Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, (for legal Exactneſs is nothing without this) the more ſenſibly and ſweetly is my very Soul united and glewed to them: their Company is ſweet; their very Countenance ſeems pleaſant; and I find my ſelf willing to do or part with any Thing for them, when called? How freely do Parents do for their Children, becauſe they are dear to them? So it is in this Caſe, in ſome Meaſure: 1 John 3.17, 18, 19. <hi>Whoſo hath this Worlds Goods, and ſeeth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath need, and ſhutteth up his Bowels of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion from him, how dwelleth the Love of God in him? My Little Children, let us not love in Word, neither in Tongue; but in Deed and in Truth. And hereby we know that we are of the Truth, and ſhall aſſure our Hearts before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, on the other Hand; if I am but a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Self-Juſticiary, I ſhall find, upon Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, (if I am not ſo confident as to need no further Trial; at leaſt I may find, but that I am exceeding loth to ſee it) that I have no ſuch ſpecial Love and dear Affection to gracious Souls, to ſavoury, experienc'd Chriſtians. My Heart, it may be, tells me that I love good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and always did: My Parents were godly, and I was educated into the good Eſteem of the People of GOD. I loved my Parents, with a natural Affection; and ſo I love ſuch as they
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:004390_0124_100D7B9B6B4D1D10"/>loved, and as loved them: And I love good Folks becauſe they are ſober and honeſt, and do Good to my ſelf and others: I cannot endure profane, and wicked, and diſhoneſt People: But as for that dear Affection to experienc'd Chriſtians, as they are called, I don't know what you mean by it. Their Relations of ſtrange Joys and Terrors, Light and Darkneſs, and Temptations, may be melancholly Fancies, Dreams and Deluſions, for ought I know: I fear, if they are right, I ſhould be found wrong, (ſays the ſelf-righteous Man, whoſe Enmity works ſtrangely at the hearing ſo much of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences) and then how can I love ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me, Gal. 4.28, 29. <hi>Now, we Brethren, as</hi> Iſaac <hi>was, are the Children of Promiſe. But as then, he that was born after the Fleſh, perſecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even ſo it is now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Still I would gladly be further helpful to you in this neceſſary, but difficult and very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Work; by laying down variety of Marks and Signs of Grace: ſuch as will not deceive you, if you do not deceive your ſelves by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applying them, either for or againſt your ſelves: For they ſhall all be taken out of the infallible Word of Truth. But firſt let me premiſe two Things;
<list>
                     <item>(1) That a ſincere Chriſtian may much ſooner and more eaſily diſcover his Sincerity, than a Formaliſt can his Hypocriſy. It muſt needs be ſo, ordinarily; for the Convert knows what it is to be an Hypocrite: He can tell how his Heart ſtood affected in his natural State; and now he can compare former with preſent Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences.
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:004390_0125_100D7B9EDD1AAF00"/>Moreover, It is of the Nature of Light to make manifeſt; <hi>Once were ye Darkneſs,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but now ye are Light in the Lord.</hi> And then, the Spirit of Truth and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation dwells in them, and that partly for this End, 1 Cor. 2.12. <hi>Now we have received, not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the Things that are freely given us of God.</hi> Whereas ſupernatural Things are incomprehenſible by the natural Man; what ever common Light and Knowledge he may have: So that when he comes to examine his State, he knows not what he is to look for: if he be told never ſo plainly, he may eaſily miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take: If he looks into his Heart, it is like a dark Dungeon, where you may look long enough, and grope in vain for the brighteſt Object, if it be very ſmall; though it would be very plain by the leaſt Candle-Light: Not that there is any Grace, by the Light of the Noon-Day Sun, to be diſcovered in his Heart; yet there is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Enmity againſt Chriſt, and the Way of Salvation by a Self-denying Faith in him; and yet he cannot ſee it by reaſon of Darkneſs. He hates his Brother, becauſe of the Image of Chriſt that he bears; yet he neither will ſee it, nor can he, ſo as the gracious Soul may ſee and feel his Love to the precious Image of Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſees it; though it were in the meaneſt Negro-Slave; or in one that, through miſtake, may misjudge and diſaffect him. The Children of this World are, ordinarily, wiſer than the Children of Light, in earthly Matters; but ſet them on ſuch a Work, as I am now ſpeaking
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:004390_0126_100D7BA1DE1B8500"/>of, and they are all in Confuſion. Beſides, they can't endure Searching; whereas it is the very Thing the true Convert's Heart is ſet upon: <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved? And how ſhall I know whether my Heart be right with God?</hi> And herein he had a great Advantage for the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his Sincerity; whiles the falſe Heart is under all Manner of Diſadvantages; yet GOD can diſcover him.</item>
                     <item>(2) In this Uſe, we are not trying the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Grace, with Scales and Weights or Meaſures; but the Quality of it, as with a Touch-Stone. One ſingle Grain of Gold is as truly Gold as a Talent. Indeed, it's no good Sign, when we are always enquiring after the ſinalleſt Meaſure of true Grace: And if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire no more Grace than juſt to ſave us from Hell, and for no higher End, we ſhall never ge to Heaven: Nevertheleſs, we muſt firſt bring our Grace to the Touch-Stone, to try of what Kind it is; and then, after we have found it true; and that we are new born; and in the narrow Way; we muſt, from Time to Time, weigh and meaſure our Increaſe, Stature and Progreſs.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>But the Queſtion now to be decided is, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have ſaving Faith as a Grain of Muſtard-Seed?</hi> Whether we be in the Faith, according to the fore-mentioned 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. Not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be ſtrong in the Faith: To be ſo is our Duty; but that is our Life.</p>
               <p>Now I come to lay down the Marks and Signs, by which the doubting Soul may judge his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual State according to the Scriptures.</p>

It is certainly (if not impoſſible) one of the moſt difficult Things in the World, when we have laid down a Sign of Grace, to invalidate the Clain of Self-Deceivers, without overthrowing the Comfort of ſome weak, doubting, tempted Chriſtian: Or to anſwer the Scruples of theſe, and not imbolden thoſe Pretenders. The gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soul has an abiding Senſe of his own Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; The unſound Heart may be ready alſo, at all Times, to conſeſs that he is a vile Sinner. Where now lies the Difference? It may be diſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by this Effect in the Upright, which the Unconverted never reach to; even to juſtiſy God, though he ſhould ſhut out all Prayers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all Services; and out of our own Mouths condemn us to the Pit of Hell, when we conſeſs ourſelves to be guilty of Death; <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.41, 42.2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.26. <hi>compar'd with Iſa.</hi> 58.3.

<pb n="126" facs="unknown:004390_0131_100D7BAEED670430"/>amorous Deſcriptions of him, breathings after him, delight in his Perſon, and ſolace in his Company; like thoſe we find the Spouſe fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly acquainted with, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.2, 3, 4, 7, 13, 16. &amp; 25, 6, &amp; 3.1,—4. &amp; 4.16. &amp; 5.4,—8, 10, <hi>to the end.</hi> &amp; 8.6, 7.

Suffer a Word of Exhortation: And now, let it be your great Care to lay a good Foundation; and ſee that you build firm and ſure for the Time to come. And to this End;</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Ceaſe not, Day and Night, to cry unto the Lord, that he would be pleaſed to ſend the
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:004390_0132_100D7C6FE5117C98"/>Spirit of Truth to convince you of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as well as Sin, <hi>John</hi> 16.8. There can be no ſound Converſion without a thorough Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction: This is the Work of the Spirit, in the Day of God's Power. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19, 20. What is the exceeding Greatneſs of his Power to us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward who believe; according to the working of his mighty Power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the Dead, and ſat him at his own Right Hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now in this powerful Work, the Sinner is convinced of Righteouſneſs in Chriſt for him, as well as of Sin and Unbelief in himſelf. The Spirit of Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination ſhows us, how that Chriſt was made Sin for us, that we might be made the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God in him. He was delivered for our Offences, and raiſed again for our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And being condemned as our Surety, he could never have riſen and aſcended to the Father, had not the Law and firſt Covenant been fulfilled [by this Second <hi>Adam,</hi> divine Juſtice ſatisfied, and infinite Wrath appeaſed: Therefore is the Spirit ſaid, by our Surety, to convince of Righteouſneſs, becauſe he went to the Father; and was not ſent back again, which he muſt have been if he had not made an end of Sin, and brought in everlaſting Righteouſneſs. When a Surety becomes Bound for the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Debtor, he cannot be diſcharged, till the Debt is paid. Till the Self-condemned Sinner ſees this, he cannot believe. Plead then that Promiſe, Prov. 1.23. <hi>Turn you at my Reproof: behold I will pour out my Spirit, and make known my Words unto you.</hi>

(2) You muſt know that you can do nothing acceptably, till you have believed in Chriſt;t; and the Spirit does not work Faith, till he has firſt prepared the Soul by a Work of Humiliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. You were exhorted and directed in the firſt Place to pray for the Spirit; and God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give his Holy Spirit to his Children, when they ask him: But now, an unconverted Man can't pray in Faith, and therefore can't pray acceptably; for without Faith it's impoſſible to pleaſe God: Yet, for them to neglect Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, will provoke him; and it's a double Sin. The Unbeliever ſins in praying, becauſe he prays not aright; but he that omits Prayer, is guilty of the ſame ſinful Defect, in the want of a right Frame of Heart to pray; and then he omits a commanded Duty, (even <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was bid to pray) and ſo is doubly guilty. Pray you muſt, as well as you can; till you have obtained an Heart to pray better: But you muſt ſee that your every Prayers now, as well as your Omiſſion of Prayer heretofore, afford Matter of Shame and Humilitation; and ſo they are of great Uſe, as well as on account of the Sinner's lying more in the Way of the Spirit while he is praying, than while ſleeping in Security, on the Bed of Sloth, or running away from God, after Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, Profits and Honours of the World; or elſe, through fearful Deſpair. And thou ſhalt find, if God Intends good to thy Soul, that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity ſhall force thee to pray; or if it be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo great, as to ſtop thy Mouth, thou ſhalt ſight and groan for an Heart to pray. And, tho' it be ſometimes long firſt, yet thou ſhalt be made
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:004390_0134_100D7C744D9CB5F0"/>willing to juſtify God, though he ſhut out thy Prayers now, and thruſt thee out for ever: (as in the Text) yea, and ſhut thee up, where there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth. Thus, thou ſhalt be ſhut up to the Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.23. All other Refuge now fails; the convinced Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner has no thir Way to take; he muſt come to Chriſt for Life, and believe in him that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Ungodly, or deſpair and die; and yet, believe, he finds, he cannot, till he feel the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable, but ſweet Drawings of the Father; and then he can't but believe, John 6.44, 45. <hi>NO Man can come to me, except the Father draw him. Every Man that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> And theſe Things are needful to be known, in order to the laying a ſure Foundation at laſt; that the once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Soul ſtumble not again at the ſame Stone, and fall irrecoverably, by ſelf-righteous Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, and falſe Hopes built thereon, for want of the ſaving Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt,</p>
               <p n="3">(3) In a Word, YOu muſt deny your natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, civil, ſinful and righteous Self; and accept of Chriſt as your Prophet, Prieſt and King, on the Terms of the Goſpel. As your Prophet, to enlighten your dark Minds in the Knowledge of his Father and himſelf; <hi>(No Man knows the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but the Son, and he to whomſoever the Son will reveal him;)</hi> whom to know is Life eternal. There is a notional, hiſtorical Knowledge, which you may learn by Books and Study; by miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial and parental Inſtruction, Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and Diſcourſe: But you muſt look to him who was given for a Light to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="unknown:004390_0135_100D7C75E3607520"/>to teach you the ſaving and experimental Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſupernatural Myſteries of Faith and Regeneration: John 3.8, 9. <hi>The Wind blows where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the Sound thereof; but canſt not tell whence it comes, and whither it goes; ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus ſaith unto him, how can theſe Things be?</hi> Yea, thou muſt be willing to become a Fool, (tho' thou wert a Maſter in <hi>Iſrael</hi>) that thou may'ſt be wiſe unto Salvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. You muſt alſo receive Chriſt as your Prieſt and King; that he may, of God, be made unto you, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption, as well as Wiſdom. He that is not willing to be holy in Heart, Lip and Life, and all Manner of Converſation, can't be happy. Chriſt will ſave none, but ſuch as are willing he ſhoul rule over them. Yea, thou muſt deny thyſelf, and take up thy Croſs and follow him; or thou canſt not be his Diſciple. Self-Denial is indeed, the hardeſt of all Leſſons; but 'tis a neceſſary one; 'tis an hard Leſſon! but 'tis not impoſſible to be learn'd, it may be larn'd, andit muſt be learn'd; and thou ſhalt learn by Experience, that it's both ſweet and above all Things profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, to be all thy Life Time ſtudying Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Denial, and practiſing Self-Denial; <hi>i.e.</hi> to live and act from Day to Day, quite contrary to the ſtrong Bent of thy corrupt Heart, Thus much for the firſt Branch of the Exhortation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Branch</hi> II. The ſecond Branch of this Uſe, is to ſuch as having impartially examined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by the ten forementioned marks of a good Eſtate, or by any other infallible, Scripture
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:004390_0136_100D7C7C117EC668"/>Sign of Grace, do find ground of Confidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; according to that of the Apoſtle, 1 John 3.21. <hi>Beloved; If our Heart condemn us not, then have we Confidence towards God.</hi> The Word of this Exhortation is to you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That you lift up your Hearts and humbly bleſs the Lord.</p>
               <p>For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) It is he that has converted thee. Thou couldſt never have changed thy own Heart, any more than an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> can change his Skin, or a <hi>Leopard</hi> his Spots, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. Miniſters are but poor weak Inſtruments in God's Hand: <hi>Who then is</hi> Paul <hi>and who is</hi> Apollos; <hi>but Miniſters by whom ye believed; even as the Lord gave to every Man? I have planted,</hi> Apollos <hi>watered; but God gave the Increaſe. So then, neither is be that planteth any Thing, nor be that watereth; but GOD that giveth the Increaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Converſion is not only a Mercy, a free Mercy, (all Mercies are ſo) but 'tis a neceſſary Mercy; more neceſſary than Bread or Breath. If the Lord ſhould not have given thee this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, other Mercies would but have ſunk thee the deeper into Hell. Moreover, it is a great, a rich, a comprehenſive Merch: There's a free, full and final Pardon of all thySins contained in it; exceeding great and precious Promiſes annexed to it; yea, eternal Glory infallibly conſequent upon it. And then, 'tis a diſtinguiſhing Mercy. Not one Quarter of the World have any Means of Grace; and ſcarce a Quarter Part of them that hear the Word, receive the Truth in the Love of it; and bring forth Fruit with Patience.
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:004390_0137_100D7C7D94FC3CF8"/>You know, that of four ſorts of Ground, but one was good, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. <hi>Luke</hi> 8. <hi>Mark</hi> 4. Yet thou, (it may be one of the leaſt of Mortals, or one of the greateſt of Sinners) haſt the Marks of the Converted upon thee!</p>
               <p>I might add,</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Thou art converted for no other End, but to praiſe God: Shew forth then the Praiſes of him who has called you out of Darkneſs into his marvellous Light, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Pity and pray for others that are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.

They are carried Captive by Satan, and bound with the Cords of Sin: They are mortally ſick, and bleeding to Death; their Souls are wounded, and they are bleeding to eternal Death! O thou that knoweſt the Heart of ſuch Strangers and Bond-Slaves, pity and pray for them; and that, not only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; but for one and another by Name, as Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion may be offered; and do it fervently, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16.

                  <hi>Branch</hi> III. The next Branch of this Uſe is to a thrid ſort of Perſons who are utterly at a Loſs what to judge of their ſpiritual State. Self-Examination is a Work that requires Time and Pains, Care and Skill; now, partly thro' Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Darkneſs, partly thro' Negligence and Slothfulneſs, theſe Perſons are at a great Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and know not what to think of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Condition. Sometimes they are perſwarded all is well with them; otherwhile they are of a quite contrary Opinion concerning themſelves: And thus they live in an unſafe as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable Life, between Hope and Fear. Now theſe are of two Sorts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Some are indeed unſound at Heart; built on a legal Foundation; formal Hypocrites: (As for groſs Hypocrites, they are not ſolicitous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Matter; if they can but paſs for Saints, that's as much as they care for;) Theſe Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galiſts have pleaſed themſelves with Hopes of eſcaping the Wrath to come; and of going to Heaven when they die. Either they have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been groſly and viſibly bad; or elſe they have been awakned and reformed. They not only profeſs but practice Religion, in Church, Family and Cloſet: Many take them for good Chriſtians; and none can charge them with groſs Immorality; and they would ſain think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves right and ſafe: but they can't ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cloſe and home Preaching. The Spirit of
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:004390_0139_100D7C846BA1B550"/>Truth ſometimes in a ſearching Sermon, does even wreſt from them their falſe Hopes; and they are almoſt perſwaded that all is not right with them; that another Manner of Work muſt paſs upon them, or they periſh for ever. Their Works ſeem to be good; but their Ends are not ſo: Now, <hi>The Word of God is quick and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; ſharper than any two-edged Sword; piercing to the dividing aſunder of Soul and Spirit; and of Joynts and Marrow; and is a Diſcerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart,</hi> Heb. 4.12. Though their Intent of Heart may not be to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Men, with fair, outſide Shows; yet, their inward Thought is, that they ſhall ingratiate themſelves with God, by their good Meanings and well Doing.
<p>Fatſo Signs of Grace they truly have; and true ones they ſometimes, faiſly conclude they have: But, by the Light of the Word, and their own Conſciences, they are often condemned; yet they bring not the Matter to a Concluſion: Loth they are to raize all to the very Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and rip up that too; it's too much Coſt and Pains for them to build all a new: If they ſhould go about it, they know not how nor where to lay the firſt Stone, in this ſupernatural Building.

                  <item>2. Others are precious Saints of God, and humble Followers of the meek and holy Jeſus: They are poor in Spirit, and as low in Comforts, and full of jealous Fears: Their Grace is weak, and their Temptations ſtrong; they hardly know how to go about the Work of Self-trying; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="135" facs="unknown:004390_0140_100D7C8826B40CF0"/>They are as ready to admit every Thing that ſeems to be againſt them, as the former Sort are to catch at any Shadow fo Comfort: Or elſe they may probably be in a declining State; they have poſſibly been, for ſome Time, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted thro' the ſubtit Wiles of the Devil, the enſnaring Temptations of the World, and the conſederate Party of traiterous Luſts within, from the Ways of Piety and Purity; Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection and tenderneſs of Conſcience; Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Heart and Fervency of Spirit in ſerving the Lord: Perhaps they have given too much Liberty to the Fleſh, while Duties and Means of Communion with God: And then, no wonder if they are at a Loſs what to judge of their State. The Foundation of God, indeed, ſtands ſure, having this Seal, The Lord knows who are his: But as for themſelves, they cannot ſay, <hi>We know we are paſſed from Death to Life, becauſe we love the Brethren;</hi> or by any other infallible Mark: For, tho' they ſometimes ſenſibly feel the Workings of this or other gracious Affections and Deſires; yet, they are conſcious of many Things, in and by themſelves, which ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Truth of Grace. If they have one Sign for them, they have two, as they think, againſt them; as the other Sort, though they have many plain Signs againſt them, yet they have ſome, that they miſtake to be for them. The one hopes he may eſcape; the other fears he ſhall miſcarry. They both, as I ſaid, live between Hope and Fear; and know not, for the moſt Part, what to make of themſelves: They
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:004390_0141_100D7C89A9392578"/>have tried, and try'd again; look'd into their Hearts, and then up to Heaven; while the Word and Rules of Trial have been before their Eyes, ſounding in their Ears, or in their Tho'rs; but they can bring nothing to an Iſſue: Their preſent and eternal State remains dubious: They are unreſolved after all.

               <p>I ſuppoſe thee not only to have read over the fore going Uſe; but that thou haſt compared thy Heart and Life with the Marks therein given, according to the Directions preceeding thoſe Marks; or, after thou ſhalt have ſo done, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing thee ſtill to remain in the Dark about thy Eſtate; then, go to ſome able, experienced Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian or Miniſter, and open thy Caſe to him: Give him the Reaſons of thy Hopes at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and tell him the Grounds of thy Fears, that at other Times prevail over thy Hopes. Let him know how thou firſt cameſt by thy Hope; for this is a main Queſtion that ſuch an one as I am directing thee unto will ask, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Chap. 3. ver. 2. <hi>This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the Works of the Law, or by the Hearing of Faith?</hi> Above all, be ſure to deal faithfully with ſuch a Meſſenger; an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, as he is called, (<hi>Job</hi> 33.23.)

It's not neceſſary that thou ſhouldeſt know certainly whether ever thou didſt receive Chriſt heretofore or no; if now thou art willing to receive him, that thou mayeſt be ſanctified as well as juſtified and ſaved, he is thine: A Will to come to Chriſt, is coming to him; and him that cometh unto him, he will in no wiſe caſt out, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. By him all that believe are juſtified from all Things, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.39. As many as receive him become the Sons of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12.

Yet he could lift up his Rod, and ſtretch it out over the Sea; and upon his doing ſo, we read, (ver. 21. laſt Clauſe) <hi>that the Waters were divided.</hi> So, God commands thee to believe in Chriſt; and thou, under a Senſe, both of thy extream Unworthineſs and utter Weakneſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on Almighty Power, doſt, in the Strength of God, accept his offered Grace in Chriſt: Does not thy whole Soul now, ſay, Lord, I accept.

To aſpire after an earthly Kingdom, would be Sin and Folly in our Thoughts; but it would be Treaſon to do it in Words and Actions. Yet may we very warrantably, deſire to wear a Crown of Glory, that fadeth not away: Yea, 'tis a damning Sin, not to deſire to glorify God, and enjoy him in his Kingdom for ever. And what a Wonder of Mercy; what a Miracle of condeſcending Love is this, to the Children of Diſobedience and Wrath; that he who ſits at the right Hand of the Majeſty on high, ſhould bid us ſtrive to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in! <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet, ſuch is our natural Infidelity, and Ill-Will towards this ſweet, compaſſionate Saviour; and ſuch the ſlanderous Inſinuations of the Devil, to diſcourage all Endeavours, that

And probable ground of Hope, will induce and engage Men to ſtrive for the Things that are ſeen and temporal: Yea, a bare Poſſibility of obtaining, in caſe of Life and Death will do it. And ſhall not the Hope of obtaining the Things that are not ſeen and are eternal, excite utmoſt Endeavours, in the uſe of appointed Means? The Husbandman labours and ſweats in Hope and hath long Patience, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.7. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant lays out a conſiderable Eſtare in Building, and then ventures, perhaps, more than he is worth, between the unſtable Waters and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Winds, in the midſt of Rocks, and Shoals, and Robbers, in Hope of a rich Return. The hardy, valiant Soldier ruſhes into the midſt of a thouſand Deaths, to win a little fading Honour; and it may be loſes his End, and ends his Life in the Attempt.

5. When you are juſt ready to give out, then alſufficient Supplies of Strength may be near, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven juſt at the Door. You have been labouring and ſtriving, watching and praying, till you are wearied out and ready to faint: God ſeems to ſhut out your Prayer, when you cry and ſhout, <hi>Lam</hi> 3.8. And you are ſtrongly tempted to ſay, with <hi>Saul,</hi> Why ſhould I wait any longer on one who anſwers me not; either by Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or by Hearing, or by Prayer? The Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſſes ſore upon thee, to caſt off Duty; to give Way to Sin: Now, if thou canſt hold out a little longer, Satan's Hour (for he is limited to a certain Time in all his Temptations) will be run out; and God, who is trying of thee, will help ſpeedily: Deut. 32.36. <hi>For the Lord ſhall judge his People, and repent himſelf for his Servants, when there is none ſhut up or left, and he ſeeth that their Power is gone.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) Converſion and Salvation, Grace and Glory, our entring in at the ſtrait Gate, and walking in the narrow Way; as it is poſſible, ſo is it of abſolute Neceſſity. We may all ſay with reſpect to the working out our Salvation, and making our Calling and Election ſure, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſays concerning the Work of his Office; Neceſſity is laid upon us; wo unto us if we do it not. So that there is no room to enquire, whether it be hard or eaſy, before we determine to ſet about it, ſeeing it muſt be done; unleſs you are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to try whether there be any dwelling with devouring Fire; whether the torrid Zone of everlaſting Burnings be habitable?</p>
               <p n="3">(3) That far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory, is as well worth the moſt that can poſſibly be done as the leaſt. All the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Sorrow, Self-denial and Sufferings, of the preſent Life, are not worthy to be compared with the Glory that ſhall be revealed. One that had been in the third Heavens, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more than moſt on Earth, did reckon ſo. <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God, ſome Hundreds of Years: And what ſays <hi>Heman? I am afflicted and ready to die, from my Youth up: while I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thy Terrors, I am diſtracted,</hi> Pſal. 88.15. Yet they had both a good Bargain; though it was after long Waiting, and through much Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, that they entred into the Kingdom of
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:004390_0148_100D7C9CD194EA60"/>God. Yea, the more induſtrious a Chriſtian is in well-Doing, and the more he ſuffers for it, the greater will be his Reward in Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.11, 12.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) It is Diſcouragement and faint-Hearted-neſs, that in all Caſes, make eaſy Things hand, and Difficulties inſuperable; whereas, Boldneſs and fixed Reſolution of Mind, will make hard Things eaſy: And indeed all Things are poſſible to him, that in Hope, believes againſt Hope. If all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had been of <hi>Caleb</hi>'s Spirit; Numb. 13.30. who ſaid, <hi>Let us go up at once and poſſeſs it; for we are well able to overcome it:</hi> Six hundred thouſand Lives, beſides forty Years ſore Travel had been ſpared: Whereas the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Report of the faint hearted Spies, of tall Men and high Walls, kept that numerous Congregation from entring <hi>Canaan,</hi> a Type of Heaven, when they were juſt at its Borders.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) In a Word, our bleſſed Saviour does out of real good Will towards Men, and in very Faithfulneſs let us know, that the Gate of Life and Way to Heaven is ſtrait and narrow, and few there be that find it; many ſhall ſeek to enter in and not be able, that we might ſtrive the more earneſtly, and not be diverted and beaten back by the Oppoſitions we ſhall be ſure to meet in the Way; but remember how plainly Chriſt dealt with us; Joh. 16.1, 4. <hi>Theſe Things have I ſpoken unto you, that you ſhould not be offended. But theſe Things I have told you, that when the time ſhall come, you may remember that I told you of them.</hi> It's no Matter through how much Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation it be, ſince if we are willing, we ſhall
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:004390_0149_100D7C9F87A64468"/>enter into the the Kingdom of God; <hi>Act.</hi> 14.22. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. <hi>compared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will juſt hint at ſome Things, for our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and further Help in this great and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Work; and ſo paſs on to another Uſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We muſt know that Converſion is taken either actively or paſſively. Sometimes we are commanded to convert ourſelves, and turn from Sin to God; to repent and be converted, that our Sins may be blotted out; to make us a new Heart and a new Spirit, caſting away all our Tranſgreſſions, leſt we die; and it is our unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Duty to ceaſe to do Evil, and learn to do well; yet, theſe Injunctions do not ſuppoſe that it is in our Power to change our own Hearts: the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> may as ſoon change his Skin: They expreſs our Duty, and convict us of Guilt in our Non-performance, and bring us to our Knees, as <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Jer. 31.18, 19. <hi>I have ſurely heard</hi> Ephraim <hi>bemoaning himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned. Surely, after that I was turned I repented; and after that I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon my Thigh; I was aſhamed, yea even confounded,</hi> &amp;c. We are wholly paſſive, when the Spirit of God takes away the Heart of Stone, and gives us an Heart of Fleſh; as you may ſee more at large, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, to 33. If Chriſt were not exalted to give Repentance as well as Pardon, how great a Prince ſoever he might be eſteemed, he would be but an imperfect Saviour, Act. 5.31. <hi>You hath be quickned</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>who were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins:</hi> Yea, he doubles it over again; <hi>Even when we were dead in Sins, hath be quickned us</hi> Eph. 2.1, 5. 'Tis
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:004390_0150_100D7CA10B9485F8"/>certain you muſt turn or die; be converted or damned: 'Tis no leſs true, that you cannot convert yourſelves: Cry to Heaven then, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> above mentioned, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Keep we our Eye on the Things that are not ſeen and are eternal; 2 Cor. 4.16, 18. <hi>We faint not,—while we look not at the Things which are ſeen; but at the Things which are not ſeen: for the Things which are ſeen are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, but the Things which are not ſeen, are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> This Reſpect to the Recompence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, will make us chuſe rather to ſuffer Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin for a Seaſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25. and then to ſuffer the Vengeance of eternal Fire, <hi>Jude</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Minding ſtill our preſent Work from Day to Day; not perplexing ourſelves with what is future, ſo as to bring the Burden of many Days Work into one; yea it may be of a Life of Labour and Suffering, in a long Courſe of active and paſſive Obedience, on our weak Shoulders all at once: This is the Way to do nothing: <hi>Sufficient to the Day is the</hi> (Labour and) <hi>Evil thereof.</hi> To-morrow will bring new Strength as well as Work: <hi>For God is able to make all Grace abound towards you; that ye always having All-ſufficiency, in all Things, may abound to every good Work,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.8. Mind we then our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Work and Duty.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Yet we muſt ſit down and count the Coſt; <hi>Luke</hi> 14.28, 33. Leſt we prove like the Stony-Ground Hearers, <hi>Who, when they hear the Word, immediately receive it with Joy, and
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:004390_0151_100D7CA2B7F6D7E0"/>having no Root in themſelves, endure but for a Time: Afterward when Affliction or Perſecution criſeth for the Word's ſake, immediately they are oſſended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Above all look we to Jeſus, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Finiſher of our Faith; (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2.) as our great Prophet and Teacher; our High Prieſt, that has died to appeaſe God's Anger, and lives to proeure his Favour for us; as our royal Maſter, to rule our Hearts entirely, and our whole Lives. And look we thus to him;

                     <item>(1) When we engage in any Duty; through whoſe <hi>Strength we can do all Things,</hi> Phil. 4.13. But <hi>without him we can do no nothing,</hi> Joh. 15.5.</item>
                     <item>(2) When we come off from Duty; for we are accepted only in the Beloved, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. And may well ſay, the Sin of this Duty would damn me, if it were not for Chriſt.</item>

What are we, poor Dunghil-Worms, the beſt of us all, that we ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Crown of Heaven, and brought into the Banquet of Wine, prepared for the Bride and the Lamb's Wife; where the King himſelf, (whoſe Reign extends further than from <hi>India</hi> to <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> even to both Hemiſpheres, and all Creatures, viſible and inviſible: This glorious King) fits at the Table with his Gueſts; and walks in the midſt of the Golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks: But, let him that hath an Ear to hear, hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches: Rev. 2.4 <hi>Thou baſt left thy firſt Love.</hi> Ver. 23. <hi>All the Churches ſhall know that I am be which ſearcheth the Reins and Hearts: And I will give unto every one of you according to your Works.</hi> Chap. 3.1. <hi>I know thy Works; that thou haſt a Name that thou liveſt, and art dead.</hi> Ver. 4. <hi>Thou haſt a few Names, even in Sardis.</hi> Ver. 4. <hi>Thou haſt a few Names, even in Sardis.</hi> Ver. 15, 16, 17. <hi>I know thy Works; that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot: So then, becauſe thou art luke-warm, and neither cold nor hot, I will ſpue thee out of my Mouth: Becauſe thou ſayeſt, I am rich and increaſed with Goods, and have need of nothing; and knoweſt not that thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked: He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches,</hi> ver. 22.

We don't love to be cheated of our Money or Goods: And ſhall we deceive ourſelves; and ſuffer the grand Deceiver to cheat us of tried Gold, and that more enduring Subſtance; and ſhall we be content with Droſs and Rubbiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof?</p>

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Some may be ready to ſay, Why are we received into your Communion; ſeeing we are like to be thruſt out at laſt? You threaten us if we don't remember Chriſt and his dying Love, and ſhew forth his Death in the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; — and we can have no Quiet when all is done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We invite you to the marriage Feaſt; but we adviſe you, withal, to put on the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Garment. We never told you that Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Hearing, Receiving would ſave you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repeating and believing the Goſpel; and
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:004390_0154_100D7CACE35EEA98"/>mortifying your darling Luſts; and denying your idolized Self-Righteouſneſs; and living upon Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We multiply Cautions, becauſe we have Reaſon to fear you are not all right and ſound; though we dare not judge any in particular; for, though Love cauſes Jealouſy towards ſome; yet Charity hopes all Things.

To eat unworthily at the Lord's-Table is not the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. The Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which we are, in this Caſe, guilty of prophaning, can cleanſe us from this heinous Sin, as well as it did ſome of thoſe who ſpilt it, <hi>John</hi> 1.7. That which we are caution'd againſt is leaning on Means, Duties and Priviledges, inſtead of leaning upon the Lord; and leaning upon the Lord, while we hate to be reformed; or ſpare ſome BoſomSin; becauſe we love it more than Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To Non-Communicants; ſuch as come to hear the Word, and have generally received one Seal of the Covenant, either in their Infancy, or elſe have ſolemnly covenanted with God, and received the Seal of Baptiſm at adult Age; and many alſo of the Seed of the Faithful, that have
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:004390_0155_100D7CAF82CD21F0"/>renewed their Baptiſmal Covenant, and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avouched the Lord to be their God, in order to the Sealing of their Offspring; but yet turn their Backs on the Table of our Lord and theirs: The other Branch of this Uſe of <hi>Caution</hi> is to you: Think not, do not dream, let it never enter into your Hearts that you ſhall come off the better becauſe you make not ſo high a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as others do. I might appeal to your own Conſciences, whether you are not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times drawn away by ſuch Temptations as theſe, — We are no Church-Members; nor ſo ſtrictly tied up, but that we may take a little Liberty in our Communication, Way and Walk: We ſhall not be ſo narrowly watched over: If we come not under the Laſh of the Law we ſhall do well enough: Neither does the Lord require ſo much of us as of others: We hear and pray, and neither lie nor ſwear, ſteal or cheat; and, for ought we can ſee, we are as good as many of them; who are as hard in their Dealings as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; they will be in a Paſſion, talk vainly, and frequent Taverns ſome of them: <hi>(Wo to the World becauſe of Offences!)</hi> And ſuch as are more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure and preciſe (it's like) are as bad as the reſt; though they don't yet diſcover themſelves. And what, do they think to engroſs all the Riches of Grace and Glory to themſelves; as if none ſhould go to Heaven but Church-Members? Such carnal Reaſonings as theſe, are the inward Thoughts of very many natural Men; whereby Satan lulls their Conſciences aſleep in Security; and they dream of eſcaping Vengeance, when Chriſt
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:004390_0156_100D7CB1225AAD80"/>ſhall come in flaming Fire; tho' they live in Diſobedience to his Goſpel, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9.</p>

<pb n="154" facs="unknown:004390_0159_100D7CBA4B9197F8"/>be bleſſed. If others ſhall ſee you in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and gnaſh their Teeth becauſe themſelves are excluded; then you ſhall find yourſelves there, and have infinite Reaſon, on the contrary, to clap your Hands, to leap and ſhout for Joy: For <hi>you</hi> ſhall ſee <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Kingdom of God, and <hi>you</hi> yourſelves receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them. Now, the Grounds of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Comfort and Rejoycing, in Hope of entring into and poſſeſſing that glorious Kingdom of God, are ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt (and that without which all the reſt would be but uncertain Grounds of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation) is the inſeparable Connection that there is between Faith and Salvation, Grace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Regeneration and Admiſſion into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God: Now this Connexion is twofold, Negative and Affirmative; and ſo has a double Aſpect.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>(1.) If we conſider it Negatively, it is moſt certain, that without Faith and Holineſs, or the New Birth, none can enter into the Kingdom of God, and be ſaved; Mark 16.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6 &amp; 12.14. Joh. 3.3. <hi>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, except a Man he born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> And thus conſidered, it has a dreadful Aſpect, not only on all the openly Profane, and ſecretly Wicked, and groſly Hypocritical; but on Self-righteous Formaliſts, and fooliſh Virgins; who live, and may die too, expecting to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: But they ſhall be thruſt out. No Plea, on the Account of what they have been, and
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:004390_0160_100D7CBC08FF6010"/>done, and ſuffered, and parted with, will any Thing avail in that Day, if they have not let go their own Righteouſneſs, and come naked to Chriſt to be cloathed with his. If this be thy Caſe, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, thou haſt no Part nor Lot in this Uſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation; turn back to the foregoing Uſes; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, repent, believe; for there is but one Law for all: If thou art found out of CHRIST, at the Judgment Seat, Omnipotency itſelf and infinite Mercy cannot ſave thee: Not through any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in theſe Attributes; but the Inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of your Salvation, in any other Way, with the Holineſs, Juſtice, and Truth of GOD.</item>
                  <item>(2) Now conſider we the inſeperable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between Converſion &amp; Salvation, Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; and it is as certain that he who now has the leaſt Degree of juſtifying Faith ſhall be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16.

               </p>
               <p n="2">[2.] The Interceſſion of CHRIST is another E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the true Convert's certain Perſeverance in Faith to Salvation; Luke 22.32. <hi>I have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thee, that thy Faith fail not.</hi> Joh. 17.15. <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldeſt take them out of the World, but that thou ſhouldeſt keep them from the Evil.</hi> Ver. 20. <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe.</hi> Joh. 11.42 <hi>I know that thou heareſt me always.</hi> Heb. 7.25. <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, all that come to God by him; ſeeing he ever lives to make Interceſſion for them.</hi> And becauſe he (thus) lives, you ſhall live alſo, <hi>Joh</hi> 14.19.</p>
               <p n="3">[3] In a Word; Some of the ſtrongeſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that are made againſt this Doctrine of the Saints Perſeverance, are good Arguments for it. As now, what need of Cautions (ſay the Truth's Enemies) to prevent Apoſtacy, if there were no Poſſibility of falling away? Yea, rather,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:004390_0162_100D7CC260ED3EB8"/>why ſhould we doubt of the Saints Perſeverance; ſeeing God has not only promiſed it, but has provided all Means (among which theſe Cautions are not the leaſt) to bring it about. <hi>Take heed of Unbelief: Ye are kept by the Power of God through Faith unto Salvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. I have given but brief Hints at ſome of the Scripture Grounds on which this firſt Ground of the Believer's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is built: There is no Ground of Fear but God will bring him to Heaven; Luk. 12.32. <hi>Fear not little Flock; for it is your Father's good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to give you the Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 It is the Kingdom of GOD. The very Name by which Heaven is here called, imports its tranſcendent Excellency. We read of the Kingdom of Men, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.17. An earthly Crown of periſhing Gold is the Top of worldly Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; but what is this to a Crown of Glory, that fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for you? The Weakneſs of God is ſtronger than Men: The Wiſdom of Men is Fooliſhneſs with GOD: The Kingdom of GOD is proportionably above all terreſtial Kingdoms, in Riches, Honours and Pleaſures; even durable Riches, manifold, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Honours, and Pleaſures for evermore: Pſal. 16. ult. <hi>In thy Preſence is fulneſs of Joy, and at thy right Hand there are Pleaſures for evermore.</hi> The Kingdom of God on Earth is Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter does ſometimes fill us with all Joy and Peace in believing: Believing ye rejoyce with Joy unſpeakable, and full of Glory: What then will the Kingdom of God in Heaven be! If we rejoyce thus in Hope of the Glory of God; what
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:004390_0163_100D7CC42E68D818"/>ſhall the Joy of Fruition be? Something beyond what is unſpeakable! He that can tell what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power, Wiſdom and Love can do; and what the Blood of God can purchaſe, may tell what Heaven is: that purchaſed Poſſeſſion; that City, whoſe Builder and Maker is God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is it not Matter of ſweet Conſolation, to think what Company we ſhall have in Heaven? And that, whether we conſider the Number and Quality, or the Manner of mutual Enjoyment.</p>
               <p>Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> the City of the living God, the new and holy <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above, ſhall be full of excellent Inhabitants: We ſhall have Fellow-Citizens enough. An innumerable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Angels; and the whole General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and Church of the Firſt born, that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Heaven; all being equal to Angels. We read of an Hundred and forty and four Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of all the Tribes of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with the Mark of God's Servants in their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads: And afterwards of a great Multitude, which no Man could number, of all Nations, and Kindreds, and People, and Tongues, ſtanding before the Throne, and before the Lamb, cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with white Robes, and having Palms in their Hands; worſhipping God with all the Angels, who alſo ſurround the ſame Throne, <hi>Rev</hi> 7.3,—11. Our Lord (in the Text) makes mention to the <hi>Jews</hi> only of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the Prophets that were of their own Nation; yet, not excluding any of the Elect in that and all other Nations. Chriſt ſhall ſend his Angels, with a great Sound of a Trumpet; and they ſhall gather together his Elect, from the four Winds. <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:004390_0164_100D7CC919586F10"/>Affricans,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Aſia</hi> ſhall be joined with us of <hi>America,</hi> in that great Congregation: And the <hi>Ethiopean</hi> ſhall then have a changed Skin; it ſhall be white and ruddy, ſurpaſing the Beauty of Queen <hi>Eſther</hi> and fair <hi>Abſalom:</hi> Yea, all our vile Bodies ſhall be changed, and faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned like unto the glorious Body of Chriſt. But the Heart and Mind ſhall be adorned, enriched, and beautified (that's the ſhining, ſparkling Beauty) with Wiſdom and Grace. A Man's (imperfect) Wiſdom makes his Face to ſhine: And the Holy are the Excellent of the Earth, in whom, notwithſtanding their Spots, we have much Delight: How inconceivably delightſome, then, will the Society of Saints in Heaven be; who are without Spot, Wrinkle, or any ſuch Thing? We find, here below, one (perhaps) amongſt a Thouſand, ſo excellently accompliſh'd, well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd, and full of Sweetneſs, that he is the Delight of Mankind: Yet ſuch a Lilly among Thorns is but a Thorn in compariſon of the Lillies of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe above. The leaſt in the Kingdom of GOD will, doubtleſs, in gracious Lovelineſs of Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and heavenly, charming Sweetneſs of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, imcomparably ſurpaſs the moſt delightſome Companion that ever was born of a Woman. And then for Dignity, they ſhall be all Kings and Prieſts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6 And their Generoſity and Greatneſs of Mind ſhall anſwer their Dignity: And in Wiſdom as well as Honour, they ſhall be exalted as far above <hi>Solomon,</hi> as Heaven is higher than the Earth.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Manner of their mutual Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we may ſay, it does not yet appear what it
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:004390_0165_100D7CCB6635BD00"/>ſhall be; but we know that when we ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together unto Chriſt, at his Appearing and his Kingdom, it will be a joyful Meeting, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.19, 20. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>from ver.</hi> 13. <hi>to the End of the Chapt. compar'd with</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.1. And to have everlaſting Fellowſhip with Millions, whoſe Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Father and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, begun on Earth, by dark Views, thro' the Glaſs of Ordinances, ſhall be perfectly conſummated by the beatifical Viſion in Heaven. How delightſome will it be to ſee, and know, and walk, and talk, and with the greateſt Freedom and Familiarity, to converſe with <hi>Michael, Gabriel,</hi> and all the heavenly Hoſt of ſhining Angels: With <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve; Abel, Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Elijah; Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel; Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job; Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua; David</hi> and <hi>Solomon; Melchizedeck</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> with all the reſt of the holy Patriarchs and Prophets; Kings, Prieſts, &amp; other Old-Teſtament Believers; and the Apoſtles, Miniſters and faithful Brethren of the New! There we ſhall ſee <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and <hi>John</hi> the beloved Deſciple; <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy; Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary; Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Eliſabeth;</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout <hi>Cornelius,</hi> charitable <hi>Dorcas,</hi> &amp; that dear <hi>Mary,</hi> that lovely Penitent, who waſhed her Saviour's Feet with her Tears, and wiped them with the Hair of her Head; with all the many Thouſands that were converted, and gathered into Churches by the Miracles and Miniſtry of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. We ſhall have an intimate Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with all that were beloved of God, faithful in Chriſt Jeſus, and called to be Saints, both in <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Church of God at <hi>Corinth;</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with as many as were new Creatures in
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:004390_0166_100D7CCD19455C40"/>the Churches of <hi>Galatia;</hi> and enjoy ſweet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Saints, and faithful Brethren in Chriſt, which were at <hi>Epheſus, Philippi,</hi> and <hi>Coloſſe;</hi> for we ſhall be caught up together with them, and the elect <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> who were by the Power of the Goſpel, turned from dumb Idols, to ſerve the living God; whoſe Faith in Chriſt grew while they lived, and, all dying in the Faith their Death was but a Sleep in Jeſus. Now whether we live, and remain to the firſt Reſurrection, or fall aſleep in Chriſt, as they did, we ſhall (as I ſaid) be caught up together with all the Elect that have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſhall follow after us, to meet the Lord in the Air; and ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord, and conſequently with one another. And though it be the ineffable Viſion and Fruition of GOD and the LAMB, in the Preſence-Chamber of Glory, that makes Heaven to be Heaven, <hi>John</hi> 3.2. Yet, as the Bleſſedneſs of the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect is not conſummate in their State of Seperation, tho' they ſee and enjoy the bleſſed God, as it will be after the Reſurrection, becauſe the Soul was created with an Inclination to the Body; ſo, Man being made of ſociable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, enjoys God in and with his Fellow-Saints, unto compleat Satisfaction. But ſtill, it's GOD in Himſelf, GOD in CHRIST, and GOD in the Saints that ſhall be All in All to us eternally. To return; When that which is perfect is come, as we ſhall know ſuch as we have not known in the Fleſh, (tho' not after the Fleſh) ſo ſhall we know our dear, Chriſtian Friends, that have been of our Acquaintance here in the World; but after another, more pure, and perfectly refined Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:004390_0167_100D7CCF976A04C0"/>of Acquaintance; according to that new and heavenly State of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is above. Now, let the godly Reader think of this or that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſter of Chriſt, whoſe Preaching or Writings God has bleſſed to his Converſion and Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and removing from him all natural and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Infirmities, (for they are Men ſubject to like Paſſions as others are, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.17.) and enrich him, in thy Thoughts, with all Kinds and Degrees of Grace that thou couldeſt wiſh to thy ſelf; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing thy ſelf in the mean Time, but in ſuch a heavenly Frame as thou haſt, at ſome Time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced: Would not a few Hours free Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with ſuch a ſpiritual Father in his Study, to ask Queſtions, entertain Diſcourſes concerning Chriſt and Heaven, be better to thee than a whole Age of carnal Delights could be to any ſenſual Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure? Know then for thy Comfort, that holy Miniſters and all their ſpiritual Children, their holy Brethren ſhall, a very little while hence, meet in Heaven; where we ſhall enjoy one another, converſe together; and ſing Praiſes to God and the Lamb, without a Moment's Interruption or Ceſſation, World without End. But Oh! The Joys and Delights, the raviſhing Delights and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowing Joys, that every Moment of that end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Duration will give us freſh and new experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of! No Tongue of Man or Angel can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them: They will be a thouſand, thouſand fold higher and ſweeter than we can now ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; 1 Theſ. 2.19.20. <hi>For what is our Hope, or Joy, or Crown of Rejoycing? Are not even ye, in the Preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, at his Coming? For ye are our Glory and Joy.</hi> And this Rejoycing
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:004390_0168_100D7CD3F29C11E8"/>will be mutual, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14,— <hi>We are your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, even as ye alſo are ours in the Day of the Lord Jeſus:</hi> 1 Cor. 2.9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither have entred into the Heart of Man, the Things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> The perfect Love which we ſhall hear to all the Saints, will make us to rejoyce in the happy, glorious State of every one, as in our own. It may ſeem indeed to the fond Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our preſent, Childhood State; to the carnal Apprehenſions of what is natural in us, it may now ſeem as if we ſhould have only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſelect Familiars in Heaven, and thoſe ſuch as we have heard and read, great and good Things concerning, or been related to and converſant with on Earth: But Experience will ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of our Miſ-Conceit. We ſhall know the Saved of unheard of Nations, as well as thoſe of the ſame Church or Family with ourſelves; and the penitent Thief will be honourable in our Eyes, even as righteous <hi>Noah:</hi> (I make not the Compariſon as to exact Degrees:) The Harlot <hi>Rahab</hi> dear to us as the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> Elect <hi>Negroes</hi> ſhall walk a-breaſt with Kings and Governour, in the Golden Streets of Heaven; while they ſee themſelves united, as Brethren, both in the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond Adam.</hi> And truly, if we come to Degrees of Glory, Magiſtrates and Miniſters, the rich, honourable and uſeful, that are alſo gracious, may not expect to be dignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Heaven according to their Superiority on Earth, unleſs their Places has been fill'd with Duties, and thoſe Duties with Grace: Nor is it only Much-Doing and Well-Doing, but patient
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:004390_0169_100D7CD5A2677308"/>Suffering too, that muſt come into the Account: So that one whom God has placed in a lower Station, and his Grace has made ſuch an one more faithful; — One that has had leſs Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for growing in Grace, and abounding in good Works; yet, by more than ordinary Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, has improved his ſmaller Stock to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Increaſe; — and has had an Heart enlarged abundantly towards God, and for the publick Good; — One that has not had the Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of doing much for Church and Common-Wealth; yet has been all his Days afflicted, and born all with holy Submiſſion and ſingular Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; — Such ones ſhall doubtleſs be rewarded above many, their Equals, and Superiors in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reſpects. But this is a Digreſſion: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may ſerve to quicken Men of great Gifts, high Place, and many Talents, to ſee that their Improvement be proportionable; leſt they ſuffer a Sort of Degradation, even in Heaven it ſelf: And it may equally ſerve to encourage the leaſt and meaneſt of Chriſt's Servants; they may be great in the Kingdom of God. As all Servants will be free from their Maſters there; ſo ſome may be advanced above them: But there will be no Envy.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this Uſe with the Words of an eminently pious and learned Divine, in a Diſcourſe concerning the Joys of Heaven.</p>
               <p>'Queſt. <hi>Shall the Saints know one another in Heaven?</hi> (The Queſtion is ſuppoſed, and he anſwers it in the Affirmative thus —)</p>

                  <p>But to know one another is a comfortable Knowledge: Therefore we ſhall know one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
                  <p>Our knowledge ſhall be perfected; for we ſhall know as we are known, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. Which is ſet out by Compariſon of the leſs. That our Knowledge then, ſhall differ from that now, as the Knowledge of a Child from that of a perfect Man: By a Glaſs from that of ſeeing the Thing itſelf: That of a plain Speech from a Riddle. Why then ſhould we doubt of knowing one another?

                  <p>Society is not comfortable, without familiar Acquaintance: Be aſſured then, it ſhall not be wanting in the Height and Perfection of all Glory, Bliſs and Joy. Nay, our Minds
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:004390_0171_100D7CD92C914188"/>being abundantly and beatificially illuminated with all Wiſdom and Knowledge, we ſhall be enabled to know, not only thoſe of former holy Acquaintance; but alſo Strangers, and ſuch as we never knew before; even all the Faithful, which ever were, are, or ſhall be.

<pb n="168" facs="unknown:004390_0173_100D7B3673561AE8"/>mutual Knowledge one of another in Heaven, ſhall not be outward and worldly Reſpects, but divine and ſpiritual; as we know them in Chriſt, by the Illumination of the Spirit.</q>

               <p>Thus wrote one that could ſay of what he had written and preached, That it was the Truth of God, as he ſhould anſwer it at he Tribunal of Chriſt, before whom he ſhould ſhortly appear. This he ſpake when the very Pangs of Death were upon him, to certain of his Hearers, who came to pay him their laſt Viſit.
