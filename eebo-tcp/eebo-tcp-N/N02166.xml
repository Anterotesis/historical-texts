            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IN my laſt of the 25th of <hi>February,</hi> by the <hi>Beaver,</hi> incloſing an Agreement made with the Lord <hi>Baltemore,</hi> for the quieting of the People of both Provinces in their Settlements on the Borders, I wrote my Sentiments freely in ſome Points relating to thy ſelf and the Government, ſince which, I have, with the Principal of the Truſtees and other Friends, conſidered more cloſely of the Province and our Intereſt there, which ſeems of late to be under ſome Diſcouragement, and to have ſuffer'd by Irregularities, which it is high Time ſhould be remedied; and it may be worthy of thy own Reflection to conſider, whether much of thy late Conduct, together with ſo apparent a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of us, might not give us too much Reaſon to doubt whether thou didſt look upon thy ſelf to be any longer accountable to us, or whether thou haſt not entertained an Opinion, that ſince my Husband's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, the Circumſtances of the Family had put it out of our Power to take any new Meaſures with that Government: But I muſt take this Opportunity to let thee know, that we could long ere this have found Means to convince thee to the contrary, had it not been for our tender Regard to thy Family and the Hopes we had conceiv'd that thou wouldſt have made the beſt Application of thy known Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the Intereſt of thy Conſtituents: And to the Intent that thy future Management may be more to our Satisfaction, I ſhall now give thee ſome further Inſtructions, which I ſhall expect thoul't punctually obſerve, together with thoſe formerly given thee with thy Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And in the firſt Place,</p>
            <p>As I have with the Truſtees made a farther Nomination and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Perſons to manage our Proprietary Affairs there, by the Names of <hi>Agents</hi> or <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> thou art to aſſiſt thoſe Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners with the Powers of Government, in all Caſes where neceſſary or requiſite for advancing our juſt Intereſt, and eſpecially to ſee the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Courts and Laws exerted againſt thoſe who on any Pretence invade or detain our Rights from us: And if in any Caſe there ſhould be Occaſion to uſe the Powers of Legiſlature thou art to apply thy beſt Endeavours to procure the Aſſiſtance of the Aſſembly to joyn with thee in paſſing ſuch further Laws as may on ſuch Occaſions be wanted. And here I cannot but take Notice of thy Imprudence and great Miſtake in a Point of this Nature, as mention'd in thy laſt Letter to me.</p>
            <p>As in all the Changes of the Governours there, the Dependance of the Proprietor and his Family has been chiefly on their Friends in the Council, whoſe Recommendation alone was (as thou muſt needs
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002576_0002_0FDBB805439DFAC8"/>
remember) the firſt and chief Step to thy Advancement to the Place thou enjoys, we muſt ſtill rely on their Advice and Aſſiſtance, as our principal Security, and more eſpecially upon ſuch of them as were confided in by my late Husband; but as thy Meaſures with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil (as I have been aſſured by divers Hands) have been new and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, it is now abſolutely required, that thou reform them as follows, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p>That no Perſon be called to that Board, and admitted a Member of it without being firſt propoſed and approved of in a Council im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially and equally conven'd, conſiſting of at leaſt two Thirds of the whole Number of acting Members, after which he may be admitted at the next Sitting. But as that Country was principally ſettled by thoſe of our Profeſſion called <hi>Quakers,</hi> 'tis expected, that at leaſt one hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the whole Number ſhall be of that Profeſſion: And if any Perſon has been call'd to that Board, without having been firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved as aforeſaid, that he be excluded till ſuch Time as he ſhall be approved, and that the Number of Acting Members reſident in the Government, conſiſt not of leſs than Eight, nor of more than Twelve at one Time.</p>
            <p>The Powers of Legiſlature being at preſent lodged ſolely in the Governour and <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> without ſo much as a <hi>Negative</hi> reſerved to the Proprietor when abſent, it is of the higheſt Importance for our Security, as well as for that of the Country, that Matters of Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation ſhould be carried on, with the moſt mature Adviſement and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation: For it never was intended, that every new Governour ſhould with an Aſſembly Annually choſen, proceed to make what new Laws they ſhould think proper, to be tranſmitted directly to the King's Miniſters, without any other Check. It has therefore been the more ſurprizing to ſee thee (from whom it could have been leaſt expected) to be the firſt Author of ſo dangerous an Innovation, which entirely takes off the Security, which the Proprietor ever had, and abſolutely required of his former Deputies, that nothing ſhould be tranſacted by them with any Aſſembly, but with the joynt Concurrence and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of his Friends in the Council. Therefore for Remedy of this Grievance, it is required,</p>
            <p>That thou adviſe with the Council upon every Meeting and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment of the Aſſembly which requires any Deliberation on the Governour's Part; that thou make no Speech, nor ſend any written Meſſage to the Aſſembly, but what ſhall be firſt approved in Council; that thou receive all Meſſages from them in Council, if practicable at the Time, and ſhalt return no Bill to the Houſe, without the Advice of the Council, nor paſs any whatſoever into a Law, without the Conſent of Majority of the ſame.</p>
            <p>That the Minutes of Council be regularly kept, and thoſe of the preceding Council be read and approved at the next Meeting, and ſhall always remain in the Poſſeſſion of the Clerk of the Council.</p>
            <p>I ought to have taken more Notice than I ſhall do of the laſt Letter I ever received from thee, being of the 5th of <hi>July,</hi> 1722. But as I look'd upon it only as the Effect of ſome warm Reſentment, I ſhall for
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002576_0003_0FDBB938D3EAF7F0"/>
divers Reaſons chooſe to ſay no more of it here. I muſt however further obſerve, that <hi>James Logan</hi> ſince his Arrival here, has to our Surprize on all Occaſions refuſed the Title of <hi>Secretary</hi> of that Province, which upon Inquiry into the Cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Upon which I cannot but tell thee, that my Husband the late Proprietor and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, after a full Experience of his Probity, Fidelity and Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city for that Employment, appointed him not only Secretary of the Province, but entru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> do him the Juſtice to ſay, That we have had long Experience of his many faithful Services, and of his conſtant Care and Zeal to promote and ſupport our Intereſt in that Country. We have ſeen the Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>neſs of his Accompts, which have been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully examined ſince his coming over, and ſuch an Inſtance of his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity in making of our Returns (whereby we have been benefitted many Hundreds of Pounds by ſaving the Exchange) as can leave us no room to ſuſpect his Integrity in the Management of any of our Affairs that have been under his Care; and therefore I ſhould very much wrong both him and my ſelf to look upon him in any other View than that of a very honeſt and capable Man, and my true and faithful Friend. 'Tis therefore what we could never have expected, that a Gentleman who obtain'd that Government by my Husband's Commiſſion, and ſtill holds it on the Foot of the ſame Appointment, ſhould without any Notice to, or Direction from us, and without ever adviſing with his Council (as his Inſtructions enjoyn him in ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) take upon him to diſplace ſuch an Officer. It is therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and required, that all Commiſſions invalidating thoſe to him ſhall be forthwith be made void.</p>
            <p>That the Leſſer <hi>Seal</hi> of the Province be re-delivered to him, and remain in his Cuſtody, as it ever was from his Arrival there to thy Acceſſion to the Government; That he, by himſelf or his Deputy ſhall exerciſe all the Parts of the Secretary's-Office; That all Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Writings ſign'd by the Governour, excepting Military Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions and Licenſes for Marriage be done in his Office, and ſeal'd with the Seal of the Province. That only he, or ſuch Perſons as he ſhall appoint with the Approbation of the Council, be Clerk of that Board, and that all the Minutes of the Council ſhall remain in his Keeping. In all which I deſire and expect that there be no Heſitation or Delay; and that for the future all Means be uſed to cultivate and preſerve a good Underſtanding between you, for the publick Peace and General Good of the Province and my Family.</p>
            <p>As to the Acts for a Paper-Credit, tho' the Merchants here inveigh very much againſt them and the Manner of paſſing them, has given us Reaſon to be diſſatisfied, and might have tempted us to have had them repeal'd (which was eaſily practicable) yet upon a mature Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002576_0004_0FDBB93A3B37C658"/>
we have reſolved to ſuffer the paſſing them, yet with this full Expectation that all poſſible Care be taken to ſupport their Credit by any farther Acts that may be neceſſary for that Purpoſe, and all other Means that may conduce to that End. But we hope and expect that thou wilt never give thy Aſſent to the paſſing any Law for the creating any more ſuch Paper-Credit.</p>
            <p>We have been very much pleas'd with the happy Event of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at <hi>Albany,</hi> after the unfortunate Death of the <hi>Indian</hi> that loſt his Life in the Province; and we cannot but approve the Conduct of the Government in that Affair, and acknowledge not only the Care of the Governour himſelf, but alſo of thoſe Gentlemen who undertook ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguing a Journey for the Service of the Publick. And we hope and deſire the ſame Care of thoſe poor People the <hi>Indians</hi> may ſtill be continued, that the ſame Meaſures my Husband firſt eſtabliſhed with them may be conſtantly purſued, and that on all Occaſions of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Council, eſpecially thoſe Members of it, who are entruſted with the Affairs of Property, may be conſulted, and that all Treaties with them may be managed with their Concurrence and Approbation.</p>
            <p>We have had lately a Meeting with Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> upon the ſettling the Boundaries; and tho' we cannot yet come to an Agreement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, yet his Lordſhip ſeems no leſs diſpoſed than we are to determine that Diſpute ſome Way or other, as ſoon as poſſible, which we hope may be done within the Time agreed upon for a mutual Ceſſation. However we deſire thou wilt uſe the ſame Vigilance, which <hi>J. Logan</hi> tells us, thou haſt always exerted to defend the Province, againſt all Incroachments, if any ſhould be attempted by the <hi>Marylanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe I ſhall only add, that as thou wert choſen in the Time of my Husband's Weakneſs, by the Means of his Friends only to that important Truſt, it would be with ſome Regret ſhould we be obliged to make a Change before our final Settlement with the Crown, tho' the Means are ready at hand: We therefore earneſtly deſire that thy Skill and Abilities may be employ'd to render thy Continuance yet grateful to us, which can be no other way effected, than by thy ſtrict Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of thy former and theſe preſent Inſtructions.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I recommend to thy utmoſt Care to promote and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Vertue, Sobriety, Peace and Love among all the Inhabitants; to reconcile all Animoſities and Factions for thy own Honour, the Reputation of the Country, and our Satisfaction; a ſpeedy Account of which will be moſt acceptable to us. And in this I earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Lord may bleſs thy Endeavours, from whence the moſt ſolid Comfort will ariſe to thy ſelf, and a very great one to</p>
