            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>PREFACE.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is very lamentable and awful to conſider what Numbers of the riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generation, are <hi>walking in the Ways of their Hearts, and in the Sight of their Eyes, fulfilling the Deſires of the Fleſh and of the Mind;</hi> regardleſs of
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:003153_0003_0FF080EADB66B1B8"/>
all the ſolemn Warnings, and Calls they have had, either from the Word or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of GOD. However, we muſt continue calling on, and warning them of their Sin and Danger, <hi>whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is alſo comfortable and refreſhing to ſee, and hear, of ſuch Numbers of YOUNG PEOPLE renewing their baptiſmal Covenant, and devoting themſelves to the Fear and Service of GOD; and that there are in many Towns in the Land, Meetings of YOUNG MEN ſet up, and carried on, upon the <hi>Evenings</hi> of the LORD'S-Days, for religious Exerciſes, which if under a good Regulation, may be doubtleſs greatly ſerviceable to the Intereſts of Religion among us.</p>
            <p>IT was the ſetting up ſuch a Meeting, that occaſion'd the preaching of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Sermons, which come to you, with all poſſible <hi>plainneſs of Speech;</hi> and O that they might in the <hi>Demonſtration of the Spirit and with Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And they
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:003153_0003_0FF080EADB66B1B8"/>
ſhall do ſo, if while we are <hi>ſpeaking</hi> to the Ear, GOD will <hi>ſpeak</hi> to the Heart.</p>
            <p>I hope ſuch as are ſerious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to hear what GOD has to ſpeak to them, may here find a Word in Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for them, and that may become, by the Bleſſing of GOD, profitable to them.</p>
            <p>AND as for ſuch who are going on in their Diſobedience and Rebellion, I don't ſuppoſe many ſuch will be at the Pains of reading them: If they ſhould, it infinitely concerns them to <hi>ſee to it, that they refuſe not Him that ſpeaketh,</hi> and therefore to cry for an <hi>hearing Ear, and an underſtanding Heart,</hi> that their <hi>Souls may live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND if any may be quicken'd and excited by theſe plain, ſerious and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Calls, and Counſels of GOD to them, to hear his Voice, and be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to engage in the Service of GOD,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:003153_0004_0FF080EEC15E6EF0"/>

            <p>THE <hi>Miniſters</hi> of CHRIST, are indeed <hi>Angels,</hi> GOD has put this Honour upon His <hi>Embaſſadors,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are called <hi>Angels,</hi> in the <hi>ſecond Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Revelation, Unto the Angel of the Church of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; Unto the Angel of the Church in Smyrna, Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> &amp;c. by which the HOLY GHOST means the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> or <hi>Paſtors</hi> of thoſe Churches. The Meſſages of the Lord are ſent unto them, to be delivered unto his People, and they are <hi>to give unto every one their Portion in due Seaſon.</hi> They are to <hi>feed</hi> the <hi>Lambs</hi> as well as the <hi>Sheep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have therefore <hi>(You are my Witneſſes)</hi> been from one time to another, bringing the Meſſages of GOD unto you: I have been often warning, adviſing and exhorting of you, in the <hi>Lord's Name</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> if poſſible, to awaken in you an earneſt Sollicitude about the <hi>One thing needful.</hi> And this is what I would in the courſe of my <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> be purſuing with you, and yet more eſpecially, when I have ſuch Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities for it, as I now have.</p>
            <p>I rejoice exceedingly, that GOD has put it into the Hearts of ſuch a number of you, to meet together on the <hi>Evenings</hi> of his <hi>holy Sabbaths,</hi> for the carrying

on the <hi>Exerciſes</hi> of Religion, and that you might be encourag'd and ſtrengthen'd herein, I am now come to <hi>ſpeak</hi> unto you: And I hope you are come hither with ſerious Deſires to hear what GOD the Lord will now <hi>ſpeak.</hi>

will be found of thee.</hi> You ſhould think of theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements you have to ſeek and ſerve the Lord in the days of your Youth.</p>
               <p>You ſhould <hi>think</hi> how ready and willing GOD now is to ſhew Mercy to you, to make you the early and happy Inſtances of His Grace, to pardon, renew, and ſanctify you, to take an early Poſſeſſion of you for Himſelf; to ſet up His Throne in your Hearts, and rule and reign there, and ſo give you new Hearts and new Spirits, a Heart to fear Him, and keep all His Commandments, that ſo it may be well with you.</p>
               <p>YOU ſhould <hi>think,</hi> how that GOD will for this be enquired of, by you, to do it for you, and that it is well worth your ſeeking for. To excite your ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſeeking, you ſhould think how ſad your Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be, if the Lord will not be gracious to you, that if you ſhould die Strangers to a Work of true and ſaving Grace, you'l rue it to all Eternity, and it would have been better for you, that you had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had your Birth and Education in the <hi>Valley</hi> of <hi>Viſion.</hi> Oh <hi>think</hi> how diſtreſſing it muſt be hereafter to you, if you ſhould die in your Sins, to look back and conſider of the many precious Helps and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages you had for obtaining Eternal Life. Oh <hi>think</hi> how bitter your Reflections muſt be, to conſider of the many Inſtructions and Counſels, Admonitions and Warnings, that were given you, by your Parents, Miniſters and godly Friends; and all if poſſible to ſave you from that Place of Torment; Oh think how grievous it will be to conſider, that when you were ſo inſtructed and warned, yea and entreated to be reconciled to GOD, that the SPIRIT of GOD was often ſtriving with you, exciting you to work out your Salvation, and mind the things of your Peace,

before they ſhould be hid from your Eyes, that you were ſometimes almoſt perſwaded to be up and doing, and ſeeking the Lord while He might be found, and to call upon Him, while He was near, that yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding you perſiſted in your evil Ways, and would not be reformed, and therefore muſt periſh miſerably and dreadfully: Oh <hi>think</hi> on ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in Reſerve for the Workers of Iniquity, and of the Aggravations thereof, until ſuch Deſtruction from the Lord is a Terror to you, until you have ſuch fearful Apprehenſions of it awakned in you, as ſhall excite you with a concerned Soul to ſeek a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance therefrom.</p>
               <p>LET me alſo adviſe you, at the ſame time, to think of, and hope in the Mercy of GOD: Think, How He has proclaimed his Name to you, <hi>to be the Lord, the Lord GOD, gracious and merciful, ſlow to Anger, and of great Kindneſs, that unto Him belong Mercies and Forgiveneſſes, tho' you have rebelled againſt Him;</hi> that He is therefore ready to forgive the Sins of Childhood and Youth, to paſs by all your Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, becauſe He delights in Mercy, and takes Pleaſure in them that hope therein, and is willing to ſhew Mercy to you according as you hope in Him.</p>

                  <hi>THINK</hi> on that word which he has ſpoken, that <hi>if the wicked will forſake his Way, and return unto the Lord, He will have Mercy and abundantly pardon;</hi> and <hi>that,</hi> that if <hi>the wicked will turn from all his Sins which he has committed, and keep his Statutes, he ſhall live, he ſhall not die:</hi> Think on that Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of GOD, confirmed with an <hi>Oath,</hi> that <hi>He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights not in your Death, but had rather you would turn and live,</hi> and therefore thus expoſtulates with you, <hi>Turn ye, Turn ye, Why will ye die?</hi>

               <p>THINK on the many gracious Calls and Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions He gave to poor miſerable Sinners while He was on Earth, and the ſame He now gives by his Miniſters unto you.

               <p>THINK, how your dear <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>faithful Friends</hi> are travailing in Birth for you again, until they can ſee CHRIST formed in your Souls.</p>
               <p>THINK of the early Conſecration your <hi>Parents</hi> made of you to GOD, how they ſolemnly devoted you to the Service of GOD the FATHER, SON and HOLY GHOST, in the <hi>ſacred Baptiſm</hi> adminiſter'd to you, and have been frequently ſince, renewing the Dedication of you to GOD, in their fervent Prayers for you: Think, how often they have carry'd you

in the arms of their Faith and Prayer to GOD, begging His Pity and Mercy to you, that you might live before Him, that you might have your Hearts ſeaſoned with His Fear, that GOD would give you a Heart to ſeek and ſerve Him in your early Days, that He would be your GOD, and the guide of your Youth, that you might be preſerv'd from every Path of the Deſtroyer, and never forget the Covenant of your GOD, nor forſake the Guide of your Youth, that you might, in ſhort, be the Children of GOD, and Heirs of an heavenly Inheritance, that they might hereafter each one, be able to ſay, <hi>Here am I Lord, and the Children which thou didſt</hi> graciouſly <hi>give unto thy Servant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THINK of the publick Inſtructions, Exhortations and Calls, you have had from one time to another, how you have been entreated and urged by various perſwaſive Motives and Arguments proper to work upon your Hopes and Fears, to awaken, excite and move you to a greater Care and Sollicitude about the <hi>One thing Needful.</hi> Conſider often you muſt give an Account to GOD, of the Means and Advantages you have enjoy'd, and that if you ſhould finally periſh, they will all ſerve as heavy <hi>Items,</hi> to inflame your Reckoning in the Day of Accounts.</p>
               <p>AND,</p>
               <p>THINK much on that Day He hath appointed in which He will judge the World in Righteouſneſs, by the LORD JESUS CHRIST, who ſhall be the <hi>Judge both of Quick and Dead:</hi> Meditate frequently on the Awfulneſs of that <hi>Great and Terrible Day of the LORD,</hi> when CHRIST ſhall deſcend from Heaven in His own Glory, and in His FATHER'S Glory, and with great Power, being commiſſion'd and authoriz'd by GOD,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003153_0009_0FF080FAD9F52C10"/>
to be the Judge at that Day. Think how He will appear in the Clouds of Heaven, in ſome viſible bright Appearance, that will ſurround His humane Nature, and how He will deſcend with the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, thoſe bright and glorious Spirits, to execute His royal Will and Pleaſure, how that thouſand thouſands of them miniſter unto Him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtand before Him to do His Pleaſure. And think alſo, how He will deſcend with a Shout, with the Voice of the Arch-Angel, and with the Trump of GOD, and erect, and ſeat Himſelf on a Throne of Glory, more glorious and magnificent, than any earthly Throne ever was, and He appear infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more glorious upon it, than any earthly Monarch ever did upon His Throne of fading Glory.</p>
               <p>THINK, how the Dead will be rais'd and <hi>the Dead in CHRIST ſhall riſe firſt,</hi> ariſe immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Deſcent from Heaven by the Voice of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and afterwards the <hi>wicked</hi> alſo, for both muſt appear before the Judgment-ſeat of CHRIST. Think how incorruptible, immortal and glorious the Bodies of the Saints will be, and how frightful the Appearance of the Bodies of the Wicked, and the ignominious State they'l ariſe in, with all the marks of the divine Curſe, viſible upon them: Think how they will tremble to appear before GOD, and dread to be drag'd away to His Bar, to their everlaſting Shame and Contempt.</p>
               <p>THINK, how that when the Judgment is ſet CHRIST ſeated upon His Throne, and all Mankind brought into His Preſence, the Books ſhall then be opened, the Book of divine Omniſcience, and the Book of Memory and Conſcience, wherein are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded all the Actions of every Man, with all the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003153_0009_0FF080FAD9F52C10"/>
Circumſtances that have attended them, whether good or evil, and the <hi>Book of Life</hi> in which the Names of all the Elect are written. Oh think of the clear Diſcovery that will he made in that Day, to Angels and Men, of the things contained in thoſe Books, that are now concealed from the Knowledge of both.</p>
               <p>THINK, how all good and bad will receive their Sentence according to the things written in thoſe Books; that there will be a' Sentence of Abſolution paſs'd upon the Righteous, that He will then ſay to ſuch, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for you, from before the foundation of the World.</hi> And a Sentence of Condemnation upon the <hi>Wicked,</hi> according to their evil Deeds, even that, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me ye curſed, into everlaſting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THINK further, how there can be so Appeal from the Judgment-ſeat of CHRIST, to an higher Tribunal, and that the Judge will never reverſe the Sentence: Think yet further, how that when the Judgment is over, CHRIST will aſcend in a glorious manner into the higheſt Heavens, with all the holy Angels and Saints accompanying of Him, and leave the <hi>Wicked</hi> with the Apoſtate Angels to ſuffer the Vengeance of eternal Fire.</p>
               <p>AGAIN,</p>
               <p>THINK frequently, that you don't know how ſoon this <hi>Great and terrible Day</hi> of the LORD may come upon you. <hi>Think</hi> whether the late EARTH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUAKES may not have been Forerunners of it, ſince <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

He has ſaid, That it ſhall certainly come, and come upon you as a Thief in the Night, when you are not at all aware of it, ſhall come very ſuddenly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly, and therefore think, it may for ought I know, come very ſpeedily. Oh! <hi>Think</hi> then, What Preparation you are in, and what Proviſion you have made for ſuch a Day, that ſo you might eſcape the Things that may come to paſs, and ſtand before the SON of Man.</p>
               <p>CONSIDER, Whether you have been diligent, that you may be <hi>found of your Judge in Peace;</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, Whether you have not done many things you ſhould wiſh you had left undone, if the <hi>Judge</hi> were at the Door, and whether you have not left undone many things you would wiſh you had done, if the LORD was thus at hand.</p>
               <p>CONSIDER, Whether your Neglects of Duty and Commiſſions of Evil, the Sins of your Youth, the Vanities and Follies, you have too much addicted your ſelves to, have been ſuitably laid to heart, and bitterly bewailed by you? Whether your Careleſneſs and Negligence about Soul Concerns, does now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and grieve you to the Heart?</p>
               <p>CONSIDER, Whether you don't now wiſh, you had been more in good earneſt, than you have been about <hi>ſeeking firſt the Kingdom of GOD, and ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait Gate;</hi> that you had been more <hi>fervent in Spirit ſerving the LORD?</hi>

               <p>MY YOUNG PEOPLE, If you will not be perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſerious and <hi>thoughtful,</hi> my labour with you, will be in vain; if it ſhould be ſo with reſpect to many here preſent, I hope it will not be ſo with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to <hi>You</hi> in a particular manner, who are the <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion</hi> of my <hi>ſpeaking this Evening</hi> unto others, as well as unto You.</p>
               <p>YOU certainly have been, and are <hi>thoughtful,</hi> and will be more ſo, on the things I have adviſed to, and therefore I truſt it is, that you deſire to be directed and aſſiſted, in ſuch a religious Combination as you propoſe, for religious Purpoſes.</p>
               <p>IF I thought you were not thoughtful, ſerious and ſober-minded, and indeed concerned, that you might help forward the Salvation of your precious Souls, I would not appear with you here at this time, nor at all encourage you in ſuch a <hi>Meeting.</hi> But I hope you are deſirous of ſeeking and ſerving the GOD of your Fathers, and promoting the Work of <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>Converſion,</hi> as to your ſelves firſt, and then by your good Examples in others.</p>
               <p>THIS is an excellent <hi>Foundation</hi> indeed for you to ſet up upon, and if this be your deſire, we can chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pray with and for you, and bleſs you in the Name of the LORD.</p>
               <p>SUCH SOCIETIES have been <hi>Seminaries</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> in many Places, many have felt the good Effects of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003153_0013_0FF08108649AB658"/>
ſuch a meeting together, and have had reaſon to be thankful to GOD therefor all their Days.</p>
               <p>IT has been an Excitement to many to come and renew their <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant,</hi> and to prepare dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently for the <hi>Table</hi> of the LORD; and a means to excite thoſe that have done it, to a more watchful, circumſpect living and walking. Of ſuch Advantage, I hope thro' Grace, it will be to you.</p>
               <p>IF you would not defeat the good Deſigns of ſuch a meeting together, be very cautious and careful who you admit into your <hi>Society,</hi> don't preſently receive any that have been remarkably vain and trifling in their Deportment on the LORD'S-Days, or at other times, unleſs there has been obſerv'd for a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time a <hi>Reformation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OH ſee to it, you that are now engaging in this religious Meeting, that you are ſerious and ſober-minded, and let it be ſeen in your ſober, well-order'd Lives and Converſations.</p>
               <p>THE Eyes of GOD, Angels and Men will be upon you, to obſerve your Conduct after ſuch an aſſociat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together for the Purpoſes of Religion. And you will do incredible Damage to Religion, if you take to any vain and fooliſh Courſes, any of you; ſee to it then that you give no Occaſion to any, to ſpeak evilly of the ways of Religion for your ſakes. Let not the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of GOD our Saviour be aſpers'd thro' your means, for if after this Profeſſion of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Seriouſneſs, and more than ordinary Concern, for the Welfare of your Souls, (for that is the Language and Meaning of your ſtated meeting together) People ſhall obſerve you to be as careleſs, rude and vain, as
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003153_0013_0FF08108649AB658"/>
other Perſons, what will they not think? what will they not ſay? not only to your Reproach, which may poſſibly be juſt enough, but to the Reproach of Religion alſo, which is too good to be expos'd to any Cenſures, by your Means. But I would fain hope better things of you, and things that accompany Salvation, tho' I thus ſpeak.</p>
               <p>YOU muſt know, that we ſhall expect much from you, ſince GOD has put it into Your Hearts to meet thus together, from one LORD'S-Day Night to another.</p>
               <p>YOUR Miniſter, your Parents, the Church, and all that fear GOD, will expect to ſee you adorning the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of GOD your Saviour, which you have been inſtructed in, and do make Profeſſion of.</p>
               <p>AND to excite You, Conſider, That we can have <hi>no greater Joy</hi> than to ſee you walking in the ways of Virtue and Holineſs, Wiſe for your Souls and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and ſo like to prove an <hi>inſtructed and a godly Seed,</hi> who ſhall be <hi>accounted to the LORD for a Generation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE hope and beg, GOD will own and bleſs you in your meetings, and make them a bleſſed means of bringing You into, and increaſing your ſaving Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with GOD, and His Son JESUS CHRIST.</p>
               <p>THAT He would teach you to pray, ſeriouſly and humbly, and fervently; and that He would gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly hear and anſwer your Prayers, and ſo give you Cauſe to ſay, <q>It is good for us to draw near to GOD, and to bear the Yoke of Religion in our Youth: The Ways of Religion we find to be Ways
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003153_0014_0FF08109EED7F180"/>
of Pleaſantneſs, and her Paths Peace. As for us We will therefore ſerve the LORD; whatever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do, The LORD our GOD, will we ſerve, and His Voice will we obey. We will hear what GOD the LORD has ſpoken to us, and ſeeing we look for the things of which we have been hearing, we will by the Help of GOD be diligent, that we may be found of our Judge in Peace, without Spot, and Blameleſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>MY DEAR CHILDREN, If vou may be now, or hereafter, by the Grace of GOD, brought into ſuch Reſolutions for a pious and holy Life, by my Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, you ſhall be my Joy and Crown of Rejoicing in the Day of CHRIST'S appearing; for I ſhall, I truſt thro' the Mercy of GOD, rejoice in that Day, that <hi>I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.</hi>

Let me call upon you to <hi>live ſoberly,</hi> as the <hi>Grace of GOD which has brought Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> teaches you to do. You muſt not be raſh and heedleſs in your Walk. You muſt always endeavour to act diſcreetly and wiſely, <hi>to walk circumſpectly, not as Fools, but as Wiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>YOU muſt reſolve as holy <hi>David</hi> did, when he was ſetting out in the World, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.2. <hi>I will behave my ſelf wiſely in a perfect Way.</hi> And we read, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.14. <hi>He behaved himſelf wiſely in all his Ways, and the Lord was with him.</hi> As you grow to Years of Diſcretion and Underſtanding, you ſhould put away childiſh Things, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. <hi>When I became a Man, I put away childiſh Things.</hi> You muſt always endeavour to be under the Regulation of wiſe and good Principles and Rules, for your Direction, that you may obtain the Wiſdom of the Prudent to underſtand his Way, that Wiſdom that may be profitable to direct you at all Times, and in all Caſes.</p>
               <p>BEWARE of being too bold and reſolute, and calmly hearken to the Checks of Reaſon and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; you know how frequently the wiſe Man urges it, on thoſe of your Age; <hi>My Son be wiſe, Wiſdom is the principal thing, therefore get Wiſdom, and with all your gettings get Underſtanding.</hi>

               <p>YOU may do well to obſerve the commendable Carriages of others, as well as their ill Behaviour, that you may imitate thoſe that do well, and take Warning by thoſe that do ill, that you may receive Inſtruction from all ſuch Inſtances within your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>

upon You with all Earneſtneſs, and it is a Caution introduced with more than ordinary Solemnity, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. <hi>That no one thinketh of himſelf above what he ought to think, but to think ſoberly.</hi> Some give this Text, this Reading, Let him think unto <hi>Sobriety,</hi> let him think himſelf into a <hi>ſober Mind,</hi> and always keep in that good Mind.</p>
               <p>YOU ſhould endeavoor to have low Thoughts of your ſelves, of your Attainments and Improvements in every Reſpect, you ſhould beware of being puffed up at any time, when there may be many things commendable to be ſeen in you; You ſhould look more at what may be ſo, in others.</p>

               <p>YOU ſhould never think your ſelves too wiſe, or good, or old to receive proper Admonitions for what may be amiſs in you. You ſhould not ever think, you have no need to be further taught and inſtructed: we read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. <hi>If any Man think he knows any thing, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.</hi>

               <p>YOU ſhould never be ſo fond of your own Thought or Opinion, as to deſpiſe thoſe that are otherwiſe minded.</p>
               <p>YOU read in the <hi>Book of Job,</hi> of an excellent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Modeſty,</hi> to ſuch of your Age.

                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:003153_0025_0FF081262C2CC6E0"/>REALIZE the <hi>Omniſcience</hi> of GOD, <hi>that He ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the Hearts and tries the Reins of the Children of Men,</hi> and that the moſt ſecret Thoughts and Contrivances in your Minds, are as open and manifeſt to his all-ſeeing Eye, as any of the Actions of your Lives, and that there is a Day coming <hi>in which He will judge the ſecrets of Men by</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>according to his Goſpel.</hi> Endeavour to get the Conſideration and Belief of this, ſo impreſs'd upon your Minds, that you may be able, upon the moſt alluring Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to repel the Tempter, as that pious Youth did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. <hi>How can I do this great Wickedneſs, and ſin againſt GOD?</hi> It will be for your Credit and Honour, if you ſhall be able to ſay, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.15. <hi>But ſo did not I becauſe of the Fear of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ALWAYS ſtand in awe of GOD, when you are alone and no Creature ſees you; and be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to pleaſe GOD, when retired from the Sight of Men, than when the World looks upon you: Dare not commit any thing that is offenſive to GOD, or injurious to your Neighbour, becauſe of the Eye of GOD upon you.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>BEAR it upon your Minds, that no Place can eſcape the all-ſeeing Eye of GOD, that there is no Corner ſo ſecret, but <hi>the Father of Lights</hi> ſhines into it. Remember that, that GOD whoſe Eye is thus upon you, will call you to an Account for ſecret Sins, as well as for notorious Offences.</q>
               </p>
               <p>INDEED, not to fear GOD (ſays One) when we are alone, is not to fear Him at all; and He that ſhuns indecencies before Men, only ſhews, that they are the Gods whom he ſerves. Sobriety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

What doth it ſignify to believe a GOD, and to walk as if there were none? And to what Purpoſe is it to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Him, when His Greatneſs can have no Influence upon our Conſciences? To ſee in ſecret is GOD's Prerogative, and we then deny it, when in ſecret we dare break His Laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>HE could not be GOD if He took no Notice of our Thoughts and Actions, when we are alone, and therefore not to fear Him when we are in private, is to ſay with the <hi>Fool, There is no GOD.</hi> It is a perfect Contradiction to believe GOD's Omniſcience, and not to ſtand in awe of it. If the whole World were preſent with us, or within our View, it is not ſo much, as when GOD is preſent with us, when alone.</q>
               </p>
               <p>YOU muſt realize, that the <hi>LORD ſearches you, and knows you, that he knows your down-ſitting, and up-riſing, that he underſtands your Thoughts afar off, that he compaſſes your Path, and your lying down, and is acquainted with all your Ways, and will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after give unto you according to your Ways, and the Fruit of your Doings.

               </p>
               <p>BEWARE of all theſe Ways, and every other Way, by which you may be Guilty of profaning or abuſing the Name of GOD.

               <p n="7">7. <hi>SANCTIFY the holy Sabbaths of the LORD.</hi> You know that the <hi>fourth Commandment,</hi> does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly require you to <hi>Remember the Sabbath-Day to keep it holy.</hi> Remember then the Approaches of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Time, the Day before: Always think of that Word of <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Iſrael, Exod.</hi> 16.23. <hi>To morrow is the Reſt of the holy Sabbath to the LORD.</hi>

                  <hi>TO be concern'd to get prepared for the LORD's Table.</hi> The Invitation is made unto you, as well as thoſe that are in their elder Years, to come and ſhew forth CHRIST'S Death and Sufferings in Remembrance of Him. <hi>This do in Remembrance of me,</hi> obliges <hi>you</hi> as well as others, and while you neglect to do it, you live in the Omiſſion of a plain commanded Duty.</p>

               <p>MY next Advice to you, ſhall be,</p>

This will be a continual Feaſt to you. And always endeavour to preſerve and keep a tender Conſcience. Beware of defiling and wounding your Conſciences, by contracting any new Guilt. Be always concern'd that your Hearts may not reproach you for comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with any evil Sollicitations. Endeavour what in you lies, <hi>to keep a Conſcience void of Offence, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards GOD, and towards Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT I haſten to ſay, in the next Place,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>GRIEVE not the HOLY SPIRIT of GOD, but cheriſh his holy Motions upon your Hearts, from one time to another.</hi> The SPIRIT of GOD is doubtleſs often ſtriving with you, exciting good Motions in your Minds, under the Word and Providences of GOD; ſee to it that you conſtantly cheriſh them. Do not
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:003153_0032_0FF08138A69F38E8"/>
by any ſinful Temper or Carriage, provoke the HOLY SPIRIT of GOD to withdraw from you. GOD has ſaid, His SPIRIT <hi>ſhall not always ſtrive with Man.</hi> Men may by their unwary fooliſh Carriages, forfeit the gracious Influences of the SPIRIT of GOD, upon which he may depart from them.</p>
               <p>AND how ſad will your Caſe be, if you ſhould provoke the HOLY SPIRIT of GOD to forſake you! You would then live, only to fill up the <hi>meaſure of your Iniquities, and to treaſure up to your ſelves Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath, and the Revelation of the righteous Judgment of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OH then ſee to it, That you do <hi>not quench the SPIRIT!</hi> Carefully obſerve all his inward and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Motions, under Ordinances, and under Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, with an earneſt Concern, your Convictions may iſſue in your ſaving and thorough Converſion to GOD.</p>
               <p>I come now to the laſt Word to be ſpoken to you, at this time, and that is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>TO prepare for Death, and the eternal World.</hi> Do not any of you <hi>boaſt of a to morrow, for you know not what a Day may bring forth.</hi> How many of your Age are gone down to the Grave, and gone to their long and eternal Home? And how ſoon it ſhall be thus ſaid of you, you don't know. Oh meditate on your Frailty and Mortality every Day you live! And often in your Thoughts, put your ſelves into the Circumſtances of one a dying, and conſider, <hi>What have I left undone, which I ſhould wiſh to have done at ſuch a time, or, what have I done, that will be grievous, and bitter to me then?</hi>

               <p>AND know for your Encouragement, That your SAVIOUR is now again, ſtanding at the Doors of your Souls, and knocking for Entrance, willing to come in, and ſup with you, and you with Him. And will you, can you now, make him wait again, until <hi>His Head be wet with the Dew and his Locks with the drops of the Night,</hi> and after all refuſe to let Him in? Oh be no longer ſo ungrateful to CHRIST, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to your ſelves! Bewail it immediately, that you have ſo long ſhut the Doors of your Souls againſt a compaſſionate SAVIOUR. And now, <hi>Lift up your Heads, O ye Gates, and be ye lift up ye everlaſting Doors, that the King of Glory may come in.

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="unknown:003153_0036_0FF0814686762108"/>UNDER this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> I have particularly ſhewn,</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>WHAT Things may be proper to be ſpoken to Young People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am now to ſhew,</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>THAT the Miniſters of CHRIST ſhould be ſpeedy and earneſt in ſpeaking ſuch Things unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FOR the Proof and <hi>Confirmation</hi> of this, we may conſider ſeveral Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>THE</hi> SPIRIT <hi>of GOD may be now ſtriving with ſuch, and therefore the Miniſters of CHRIST ſhould be ſpeedy and earneſt in the ſpeaking theſe things unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE HOLY SPIRIT of GOD is frequently ſtriving with, and moving on the Hearts of ſuch. Such is the <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Long-ſuffering</hi> of GOD, that He bears with them, though they have too much <hi>deſpiſed the Riches of His Goodneſs.</hi> He waits to be gracious, and is therefore by the Suggeſtions of His HOLY SPIRIT, evidently intimating to ſuch, there is <hi>Hope</hi> concerning them; that <hi>it is now an accepted Time, and a Day of Salvation;</hi> that there <hi>is Mercy with GOD, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs</hi> for them, that if they will be now <hi>working out their Salvation with Fear and Trembling, the LORD will work in them, both to will and to do, of his own good Pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE SPIRIT of GOD ſo ſets home the preached Word, that they are ſometimes prick'd to the Heart by it, and convinc'd of <hi>Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:003153_0036_0FF0814686762108"/>
Judgment to come.</hi> They have a mighty Concern a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakned in them, about what they ſhall do, that they may be ſaved. Their great Inquiry now is, <hi>LORD, What wilt thou have me to do?</hi> And, <hi>What ſhall I do, that I may inherit eternal Life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEY now ſee themſelves in continual Danger of the amazing Wrath of GOD overtaking them, while in an unconverted Eſtate, and are more concerned, than ever they were, to make their Eſcape from it, and are now with greater Concern, than ever, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on GOD, in the uſe of the Means appointed for their <hi>Converſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND now, this is a ſpecial and <hi>peculiar Seaſon,</hi> for the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of CHRIST to improve, in treating with ſuch, and if they are now earneſtly intreating, perſwading and exhorting of them, to <hi>ſtrive NOW to enter in at the ſtrait Gate,</hi> to <hi>ſeek firſt the Kingdom of GOD;</hi> Now, the Goſpel of the Kingdom is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to preſs into it, to mind this <hi>one thing needful</hi> in the firſt Place, and before every thing elſe, to make Religion and the Care of their Souls Salvation their principal Buſineſs and Concern, and ſubordinate eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing elſe to it; and therefore immediately <hi>ſeek the LORD, while He may be found, and call upon Him white He is near,</hi> and reſolve <hi>not to let Him go, until He bleſs them,</hi> until they ſhall <hi>receive the Bleſſing from the LORD, and Righteouſneſs from the GOD of their Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF they are now thus ſpeaking to them, there will be great Hope, concerning their being wrought upon, the Conſideration whereof, may well excite the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of CHRIST</hi> to be ſpeedy and earneſt in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch, as hoping, that while they are ſo ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:003153_0037_0FF08149D78E5988"/>
that may be the happy Seaſon, in which the SPIRIT of GOD may be at work upon their Hearts, and ſo they will be the more likely to hear, and receive Inſtruction, and be made wiſe, even wiſe unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>AND if our ſpeaking may be accompany'd with the gracious Influences of the SPIRIT of GOD, ſo that any may be thereby brought ſavingly Home to GOD, how ſpeedy and earneſt ſhould we be, upon the Proſpect of ſuch happy Fruits of our Labours, for the Salvation of the precious Souls of ſuch? The Proſpect and Hope of it, may well animate us to do our utmoſt for their <hi>Converſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>YOUR ſpeedy return to GOD will be pleaſing to Him, and moſt for His Glory, and for your Comfort, and the Good of others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE great Deſign of all that is ſpoken to you, from one time to another, in the Name of the LORD, is to bring you to <hi>return to the LORD, from whom you have fallen by your Iniquities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GOD ſends His Miniſters to intreat and beſeech you to lay down your Arms of Rebellion, and make your Peace with Him. And if you will <hi>this Evening,</hi> hearken to His gracious Calls and Invitations, He will take Pleaſure in you. It will be very pleaſing and acceptable to Him, if you are early ſeeking, and ſerving, and devoting your ſelves to Him. GOD deſires the firſt ripe Fruits, and it is meet He ſhould be firſt acknowledged. And ſurely He infinitely deſerves it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="unknown:003153_0037_0FF08149D78E5988"/>AND if you hearken to the Voice of GOD now, in your Youthful Days, this will conduce moſt to the Glory of GOD, and the Good of others. GOD is moſt glorify'd by your early ſeeking of Him, by your early Obedience to His <hi>Voice.</hi> Such <hi>ſhall be like a Tree planted by the Rivers of Water, that bringeth forth his Fruit in his Seaſon;</hi> ſuch are like to do ſome good, in the World, whoſe Youth is ſanctify'd by <hi>early Piety.</hi> — And 'tis certain you will do Duty more eaſily and comfortably now, than hereafter, becauſe of fewer Hindrances, than there will be in time to come, for the longer you live, and the further you go into the World, the more difficult you will certainly find it to repent and turn to the LORD. And if you will now do it, if the LORD may now hear <hi>you bemoaning your ſelves, and repenting in Duſt and Aſhes, His Bowels will yern towards you, and He will ſurely have Mercy on you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND if you are thus in your early Days, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the Voice of GOD, it will be greatly encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging to others, to induce and excite them to be obedient to the Voice of GOD too: And ſo you may be inſtrumental of promoting the good of others.</p>
               <p>AND if you are religious betimes, It will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tend to your own Comfort, to fill you with Joy and Peace, a holy Security and Serenity of Mind, that will be inexpreſſibly refreſhing to you. And now may not the Conſideration of theſe Things well excite and animate CHRIST'S Miniſters, to be ſpeedy and earneſt in delivering the Meſſages of the LORD, unto Young People, ſince a Compliance with them, will have ſuch a happy Tendency, in one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, and another.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="unknown:003153_0038_0FF0814B65295DE0"/>
are ſent to intreat Sinners to be reconciled to GOD, to be ſpeedy, and earneſt in delivering their Meſſages to them.</p>
               <p>THEY conſider, they are frail and dying Men and Children, they have to deal withal, that they are poſting along into the eternal World, that they are very quickly, and they know not how ſpeedily, to be cited before the <hi>Tribunal of GOD, and give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Deeds done in the Body,</hi> and receive their Doom, <hi>according to what they have done;</hi> and how dreadful their Doom will be, if they ſhould be ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriz'd into Eternity, while they are going on in an unconverted Eſtate: and therefore they improve all convenient Opportunities to adviſe, and counſel, to admoniſh and warn all ſuch to mind the <hi>Things of their Peace, before they ſhall be hid from their Eyes,</hi> and to <hi>work while the Day laſts, before the Night comes in which they cannot work,</hi> and therefore <hi>to hear the Voice of GOD to Day, and no longer harden their Hearts,</hi> that they would immediately <hi>think upon their Ways, and turn their Feet to the Teſtimonies of GOD,</hi> that they would <hi>make haſte, and delay not to keep the Commandments of GOD;</hi> that they would <hi>not quench, or grieve the SPIRIT of GOD,</hi> once more; that they would immediately comply with his bleſſed Motions, <hi>to confeſs and forſake their Sins,</hi> and give up themſelves to GOD, and become ſerious, and ſober-minded, and wiſe for their Souls and Eternity, while the <hi>LORD is waiting to be gracious.</hi>

For the Confirmation of this, let me turn you to that awful Text of Scripture, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Son of Man, I have made thee a Watchman unto the Houſe or Iſrael, therefore hear the Word at my Mouth, and give them warning from me.

               <p>AND how awfully tremendous will it be, if Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould be given to any of you, hereafter to ſay; I am, I muſt acknowledge, juſtly condemn'd to that Miſery and Torment I feel, GOD and His Throne is clear and guiltleſs; But I might have eſcaped theſe

               <p>I ſeldom heard, that it would be ſuch <hi>a fearful Thing to fall into the Hands of the living GOD,</hi> or ſuch Deſtruction from GOD would have been more of a Terror to me.
