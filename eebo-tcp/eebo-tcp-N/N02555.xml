            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

by Dreams, the Repreſentations of things to the Fancy in Sleep; and oftentimes by Viſions, the Repreſentations of things to the waking Eye; hence the Prophets were called <hi>Seers.</hi> In the laſt manner <hi>God</hi> ſpake much to the <hi>Jews</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Zechariah.</hi> Eight diſtinct Viſions are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in this Book; the moſt of which were granted for the Encouragement and Comfort of <hi>God</hi>'s People, after their Return from the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh</hi> Captivity. In the Words of my <hi>Text,</hi> the Prophet declared to the <hi>Jews</hi> the firſt Viſion that he receiv'd. He had before call'd them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, exhorted them to turn unto God, and aſſur'd them that if they did ſo the Lord of Hoſts would turn unto them. Upon their humble and penitent Confeſſion of their Sins, and of the Juſtice of <hi>God</hi>'s dealings with them, <hi>Zechariah</hi> was ſent to make known to them what Token, or Appearance he had ſeen of the Lord's retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to <hi>Jeruſalem with Mercies:</hi>
               <q>I ſaw by Night, and behold, a Man riding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>That we may underſtand this Viſion, which doubtleſs was written for our learning, we muſt inquire,</p>
            <p n="1">I. Who the Man was, whom the Prophet ſaw riding upon a red Horſe, and what was ſignified thereby?</p>
            <p n="2">II. What was intended by his ſtanding among the Myrtle-trees that were in the Bottom?</p>
            <p n="3">III. What the red Horſes, ſpeckled, and white behind him, repreſented?</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>A. <hi>That he was the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared thus as a mighty Man of War, to protect his People, and deſtroy his and their Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>He was the Man Chriſt Jeſus, whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaw riding upon a red Horſe.</hi> Before the <hi>Son of God</hi> took on him the humane Nature, he on ſome ſpecial Occaſions aſſum'd, and appear'd in a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Form. Thus he exhibited himſelf to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in the Plains of <hi>Mam<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e,</hi> Gen. 18. One of the three Angels, which in bodily ſhapes ſtood by <hi>Abraham,</hi> is expreſly ſtiled JEHOVAH, which is the incommunicable Name of God; and <hi>Abraham,</hi> in his Addreſſes to him for <hi>Sodom,</hi> called him the Lord, and the Judge of all the Earth. Her afterwards appear'd to <hi>Joſhua</hi> in the ſhape of a Man, as <hi>Captain of the Lord's Hoſt, with a Sword drawn in his hand</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Joſh. 5.13.</note>. That muſt be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſon, otherwiſe he would not have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>Joſhua</hi> to fall on his face to the Earth, and worſhip him; nor have bid him looſe his Shoe from off his foot, telling him that the place whereon he ſtood was holy, as being Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the divine Preſence. — So he was the Son of God whom <hi>Zechary</hi> ſaw by Night in the ſhape of a Man. We have not only the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Conſent of Expoſitors herein, but alſo ſuch an Account given of him in our Context, as may well induce us to think that he was the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> who thus appeared. He is ſtiled
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003030_0006_0FEFAF5360BA3450"/>
the <hi>Angel of the Lord</hi>; and this is one of Chriſt's Titles. He is ſo call'd, not in regard of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he aſſum'd, but the Office he undertook. The Angel of God which ſpake to <hi>Jacob</hi> in a Dream, is ſaid to be the <hi>God of Bethel</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. 31.</note>. With that Perſon in the form of a Man, <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſtled a whole Night; and <hi>Hoſea</hi> telleth us, that he was the <hi>Angel,</hi> and the <hi>Lord God of Hoſts</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Hoſ. 12.</note>. Chriſt is the <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> the Angel <hi>of the Covenant,</hi> Mal. 3.1. becauſe the Father ſent him into the World to negotiate and eſtabliſh a Peace betwixt God and Man, on the Articles of the New-Covenant. Now he whom the Prophet ſaw in this Viſion, is ſtiled the Angel, and the Angel of the Lord, in the Context, and this Title belonging to Chriſt, may we not ſuppoſe that he was the Perſon here repreſented? Eſpecially, if we farther obſerve, how thoſe which were behind him, having walked to and fro through the Earth, render'd an Account to him, v. 11. <hi>They anſwered the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord that ſtood among the Myrtle-trees, and ſaid, we have walked through the Earth, and behold, all the Earth ſitteth ſtill, and is at reſt.</hi> Theſe were Created Angels, (as we ſhall preſently ſee) and to whom are they put in ſubjection, and unto whom are they accountable, but unto <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Lord of Angels?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Furthermore,</hi> this Man, this Angel, whom the Prophet ſaw, made Interceſſion for the Church, V. 12. <hi>Then the Angel of the Lord anſwered and ſaid, O Lord of boſts, how long wilt thou not have Mercy on Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. The Created Angels do not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>ex officio,</hi> intercede with God for his People on Earth: The increated Angel of the Covenant is
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003030_0007_0FEFAF55C38E2800"/>
the only Mediator between God and Man. The Angel who thus prayed for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was the ſame whom <hi>John</hi> ſaw performing this Office of a Prieſt, Rev. 8.3, 4. <hi>Another Angel came and ſtood at the Altar, having a golden Cenſer, and there was given unto him much Incenſe, that he ſhould offer it with the Prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus, it is very probable, if not more than ſo, that he was the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> who appear'd in this Viſion to the Prophet.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His riding upon a <hi>red Horſe</hi> ſignified that he came as a great General, a mighty Man of War, to defend his People, and deſtroy his and their Enemies.</p>
            <p>The God of <hi>Jeſurun,</hi> who rideth upon the Heavens, for the help of his People, and in his Excellency on the Sky, was by the Prophet ſeen riding upon a <hi>red Horſe.</hi> This glorious <hi>Captain of the Lord's hoſt</hi> came toward <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not on foot, but riding; which denoted his coming with ſpeed, and Enſigns of Majeſty, to relieve and defend his oppreſſed People.

rattling againſt him, the glittering Spear and the Shield: He ſwalloweth the Ground with fierceneſs and rage, — he ſaith among the Trumpets,</hi> ha, ha; <hi>and he ſmelleth the Battle afar off, the thunder of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and the ſhouting</hi>

            <p>Not only the Kind, but alſo the Colour of the warlike Beaſt on which he rode, is obſervable, and hath it's ſignificancy: Behold, a Man riding upon a <hi>red</hi> Horſe. The grand Enemy of the Church is ſet forth by this Colour, Rev. 12.3. <hi>Behold, a great red Dragon, having ſeven Heads, and ten Horns</hi>: i. e. The Devil with his many crafty and powerful Confederates. The redneſs of the Dragon imports the fierce and bloody Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Satan</hi> and his Agents toward the <hi>Woman,</hi> the Church: That the Enemies of the Church are ſet on fire with a helliſh flame of Wrath and Cruelty againſt it; and are often red with the blood of Martyrs.

            <p n="1">1. This denotes <hi>Chriſt's fiery Indignation</hi> againſt his and their Enemies. Red is the Colour of Anger: a fiery Colour.

            </p>
            <p>A. Chriſt's preſence with his People in their <hi>low Condition.</hi>— The Myrtle-trees repreſented the People of God; were <hi>Emblems</hi> of the Saints.

This is a promiſe to the Church, that it ſhould be delivered from hurtful vexatious Men, and repleniſhed with holy and uſeful Believers, and with all ſorts of divine Graces and Bleſſings.</p>
            <p>In theſe places of holy Scripture, the true people of God are compared unto Myrtle-trees; and why ſhould not we think that they were ſignified by the Myrtle-trees in this Viſion?</p>
            <p>The Myrtles are valuable, verdant Trees; and ſo fit Emblems of the excellent, flouriſhing and fruitful Servants of God. The Myrtles are very beautiful Trees, the Branches thereof were uſed to adorn Houſes withal <note n="†" place="bottom">

The Myrtles are odoriferous Trees; they are not only pleaſant to the ſight, but alſo grateful to the ſmell; they yield a ſweet and refreſhing Oil. The Saints therefore are fitly compared to them, in reſpect of the fragrancy of their Graces and good Fruits.

            <p>The Myrtle-trees which our <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaw, were in the Bottom, a low piece of Ground; ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the people of God in a low, afflicted Condition. The <hi>Jews</hi> being then newly come from <hi>Babylon,</hi> to reſettle the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and rebuild the Houſe of <hi>God</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> were in low, dark, and melancholly Circumſtances at
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003030_0013_0FEFAF634A9B2DF0"/>
that time. They were ſurrounded with enemies, proud and ſtrong; which like Mountains over-top'd them: Zech. 4.7. <hi>Who art thou, O great Mountain?</hi> The Nations about them hated and oppreſſed them; therefore Myrtle-trees in the Bottom, did aptly ſet forth their Condition. And this is frequently the ſtate of God's People in this world: they are oftentimes brought low, yea, very low; are greatly depreſſed by their Enemies, who exalt themſelves againſt them. But, for their comfort, the Prophet ſaw the Man on a red Horſe, ride into the Myrtle-Grove in the Bottom, and there make a halt; repreſenting the Lord Jeſus Chriſt's ſeaſonable coming to the ſuccour of his People in their low Condition. He will then be preſent with them, to defend and ſave them. He may ſuffer them to be brought low, but not to be quite trodden down by their Enemies. He will remember them, and appear for them, in their low eſtate. Iſai. 63.9. <hi>In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them, all the days of old.</hi> And as this Angel of God's preſence, the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, was all the days of old with his People in their low eſtate, ſo he will be with them all the days to come: <hi>Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the World. Amen.</hi> He is among the Myrtle-trees in the bottom, as in an Ambuſh; undiſcover'd by the Enemies of the Church, and will in the fitteſt ſeaſon ariſe for her defence, and to their Surprize and Confuſion. Pſal. 46.5, 6, 7. <hi>God is in the midſt of her; ſhe ſhall not be moved: God ſhall help her, and that right early,</hi> (or, <hi>when the Morning appeareth,</hi> as it is rendred in the Margin, i. e. <note n="†" place="bottom">

            <p>Q. III. What did the <hi>red Horſes, ſpeckled, and white, behind the Man which ſtood among the Myrtle-trees in the bottom,</hi> repreſent?</p>
            <p>A. <hi>Holy Angels</hi> attending on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ready to be employed by him for the defence of his People, and the deſtruction of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>The Prophet ſaw a goodly Troop behind the Man riding on a red Horſe: He ſaw a Company of Horſes, with their Riders doubtleſs, having every one a Slaughter-weapon in his hand, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalled to Battle, under the Command of a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Captain; whom <hi>Zechariah</hi> (as it ſeems) quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiv'd to be a divine Perſon, the bleſſed Angel of the Covenant, and therefore apply'd himſelf to him as his Lord, deſiring to know what thoſe were behind him. — v. 9, 10. <hi>Then ſaid I, O my Lord, what are theſe? And the Angel that talked with me, ſaid unto me, I will ſhew thee what theſe be. And the Man that ſtood among the Myrtle-trees anſwered and ſaid, Theſe are they whom the Lord hath ſent to walk to and fro through the Earth.</hi> This Information which the Prophet receiv'd from the Mouth of the faithful and true Witneſs, ſheweth that they were Angels, which the Horſes behind the Man that ſtood among the Myrtle-trees repreſented: For <hi>are they not all miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them who ſhall be
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003030_0015_0FEFAF67661A9F98"/>
Heirs of Salvation</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. 1.14.</note>? The Account which is in our Context given of the Horſes behind the Man ſtanding among the Myrtle-trees, agrees with that which the Apoſtle gives of the holy Angels of God: They are ſuch whom the Lord ſends forth, and improves as chief Miniſters of his Providence. This was not the only time that Angels appear'd in the form of Horſes; See 2. King 6.17. Zech. 6.2, 3. Horſes are Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems of Angels, in regard of their ſwiftneſs, ſtrength and courage. The Angels were in this Viſion repreſented by Horſes of divers Colours, <hi>red, ſpeckled and white</hi>; ſignifying the various Offices to which they are deputed, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Events of Providence in which they are made uſe of, and perhaps alluding (as One ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſteth) <q>to the diverſities of Colours in the ſtandards of an Army, for Soldiers to know their Leaders, and keep Rank and Order.</q>— We ſhall conſider the Angels now only in their Martial Character, for they are here repreſented in a War-like Poſture, formed into a ſtrong Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion: And they are in Scripture termed an <hi>Hoſt,</hi> and the <hi>Army of Heaven.</hi> They are good Soldiers of Jeſus Chriſt: are under his Command: This was ſignified by the place in which they appear'd; <hi>Behind</hi> the Man riding on a red Horſe. The Captain of our Salvation, is Captain-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the heavenly Hoſt. By Right of Creation, the Son of God is the Lord and Leader of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; <hi>for by him were all things Created that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, viſible and inviſible, whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or Powers: all things were Created by him, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003030_0016_0FEFAF6908236B78"/>
for him.</hi> And, as Mediator, Chriſt Jeſus is the Head of Angels: for altho' the humane Nature be lower than the Angelical, yet the Son of God aſſuming it into perſonal Union with the divine, he as God-Man, is far ſuperior to all Created Angels: And for a Reward of his deep humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, God the Father hath exalted him, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, to a ſupreme Dominion over them: <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and Authorities, and Powers, are made ſubject to him.</hi> Thus, the Scriptures of the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> clearly reveal to us, what was in this Viſion darkly repreſented to the Prophet, <hi>viz.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt hath all the Angels of Heaven under his Command: They are behind him, ready to receive and execute his Orders.</p>
            <p>And he employs them,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>For the defence and ſalvation of his People,</hi> while they remain in this World, and when they paſs into another. The holy Angels protect and deliver the Servants of Chriſt in this World, both from their bodily, and their ſpiritual Enemies. From their <hi>bodily Enemies</hi>; Pſal. 34.7. <hi>The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.</hi> But, how can an Angel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp about the Multitude who fear God? En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping about them imports an Hoſt's ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them, to guard them from dangers on every ſide. — I anſwer, that either the Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Number is here put for the Plural, as it is in other Texts of Scripture; or elſe, by the Angel of the Lord is here meant Chriſt Jeſus, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points an Army of Created Angels to encamp about his People. They are a conſtant, ſtrong and faithful Life-Guard to the Saints, who are
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003030_0017_0FEFAF6D628FBF70"/>
way-lay'd by Enemies whitherſoever they go. Pſal. 91.11, 12, 13. <hi>He ſhall give his Angels Charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They ſhall bear thee up in their hands, leſt thou daſh thy foot againſt a Stone. Thou ſhalt tread on the Lion, and Adder: the young Lion and the Dragon ſhalt thou trample under feet.</hi> They ſhrowd them under the Wings of their kind Protection; oppoſe and hinder the malicious Deſigns, even of their bodily Foes.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Eſau</hi> was coming to meet <hi>Jacob,</hi> and four hundred Men with him, to deſtroy his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Jacob went on his way, and the Angels of God met him. And when Jacob ſaw them, he ſaid, This is God's hoſt: and he called the Name of that place Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanaim</hi>: two Hoſts, or Camps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gen. 32.1, 2. Troops of holy Angels met him, to aſſure him that they would fight for him againſt his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> if there ſhould be any Occaſion therefor. When the King of <hi>Syria</hi> ſent a great Hoſt, both with Horſes and Chariots, againſt the Prophet of the Lord, <hi>Behold, the Mountain was full of Horſes, and Chariots of fire round about Eliſha.</hi> 2 King. 6 17. There was a Guard of mighty Angels about him. When the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were fall'n into the hands of their bloody Perſecutors, <hi>the Angel of the Lord by Night opened the Priſon-doors, and brought them forth.</hi> Act. 5.19. All the Locks and Bars of the Priſon, and the Vigilance and Strength of the Keepers of it, could not detain them, when the Angel came to bring them forth. Thus, the Angels are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd by Chriſt for the Temporal Defence and Deliverance of his People. — And they are ſo likewiſe for their Defence againſt Spiritual Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. We wreſtle not againſt Fleſh and Blood, (not only, nor chiefly againſt humane and bodily Enemies) but againſt Principalities, againſt Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,

againſt the Rulers of the darkneſs of this World, againſt ſpiritual Wickedneſs in high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And Believers are aſſiſted in their Warfare againſt the many Ranks of Devils by the holy Angels. <hi>Michael</hi> and his <hi>Angels</hi> do fight againſt the <hi>Dragon</hi> and his <hi>Angels</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. 12.7.</note>. The good Angels vigorouſly reſiſt the evil Spirits, and prevent their accompliſhing of their wicked, miſchievous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. They often times ſecure the Servants of Chriſt from the Wiles, and ſhield them from the fiery Darts of Satan. When the <hi>Devil left Chriſt, behold, Angels came, and miniſtred unto him.</hi> Mat. 4.11. The Angels did not come to him until the Combat was over, and the Devil had quitted the Field: But they come, and miniſter to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in their Conflicts with the Powers of darkneſs. They came to Congratulate Chriſt's victory; but they come to help the Saints obtain theirs. Jeſus Chriſt did admit the aſſiſtance of an Angel in his Agony in the Garden; at which time he was doubtleſs moſt violently aſſaulted by the Devil: Luk. 22.43. <hi>There appeared an Angel unto him from Heaven, ſtrengthning him.</hi> This might be, to encourage and aſſure his followers, that they ſhou'd have Angels to ſtrengthen them againſt their ſpiritual Enemies, whom they muſt reſiſt unto blood, with Agonies ſtriving againſt Sin.</p>
            <p>Holy Angels are employed by Chriſt for the Defence of his People, not only while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this World, but alſo when they paſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the next: Not only before, but alſo after Death They may ſometimes guard the dead
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003030_0019_0FEFAF725C65BAC8"/>
Bodies of the Saints. <hi>Michael the Arch-Angel contended with the Devil about the Body of Moſes.</hi> Jude v. 9. Men have differently conjectur'd what the ground of that Conteſt was. <hi>One</hi> thinks, "that Satan reſolv'd to do ſome harm to the dead Body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that Man of God; which <hi>Michael</hi> and his Retinue perceiving, watch'd over it, carefully defended it, and would not ſuffer the infernal Spirits to ſeize on it". Whether this were the Controverſy betwixt <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> and the Devil about the Body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or not, I pretend not to ſay, for the Scriptures are ſilent concerning it: neither do they expreſly tell us that the good Angels guard the Saints Bodies after Death: Yet it is not altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that they ſometimes do this kind Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for them: for <hi>precious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints</hi>; ſo precious, as that he may give Angels charge concerning their Duſt, to keep it from being attack'd and abus'd by malicious Men and Devils.— But, whether the Angels guard the dead Bodies of the Saints, or not, we know that they are the Convoys of their happy Souls to Paradiſe. <hi>There appeared a Chariot of Fire, and Horſes of Fire,</hi> i. e. holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, to conduct <hi>Elijah</hi> to Heaven, 2 King. 2.11. The Horſes behind Chriſt, the bleſſed Angels under his command, are as really, tho' not ſo viſibly, ſent by him, to conduct the Souls of all Believers to Heaven. Luk. 16.22. <hi>It came to paſs that the Beggar died, and was carried by the Angels into</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Boſom.</hi> The mighty Angels guard the Souls of Believers thro' the Territories of the Prince of the Power of the Air; protect them from malicious Spirits, who, like Birds of Prey, watch to ſeize upon them in their ſlight
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003030_0020_0FEFAF75D1540CE8"/>
to Heaven; do ſecure them from the infernal <hi>Pharoah,</hi> who with an hoſt purſues them to their Coeleſtial <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Jeſus Chriſt employs the holy Angels, in a military way, for the Defence and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his People.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He employs them for the <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of his and his People's Enemies. We find in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, that thoſe whom the Prophet ſaw behind the Man that ſtood among the Myrtle-trees, were ſent forth as Spies, to diſcover the Poſture which the Enemies were in: and they are ſent forth alſo, as Armies, to vanquiſh and deſtroy them. Chriſt brings the Forces into the Field of Battle, when he comes to make War upon the Enemies of his Kingdom: Joel 3.11. <hi>Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe the mighty ones to come down, O Lord.</hi> By the mighty ones here, may be intended the mighty Angels of Chriſt.

more than we are aware of, in the juſt Wars of the Church; and are great Inſtruments of breaking the Power of its Enemies. And the final deſtruction of all the Enemles of Chriſt, and of his People, ſhall be accompliſh'd by the Miniſtry of Angels. Jeſus Chriſt will at the great Day be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty <hi>Angels,</hi> in flaming Fire, to take Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on them who know not God, and obey not the Goſpel.— The Son of Man ſhall ſend forth his <hi>Angels,</hi> and they ſhall gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend, and them which do Iniquity; and ſhall caſt them into a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of Fire.— They ſhall bring forth all his Enemies, which would not that he ſhould reign over them, and ſlay them before him.</p>
            <p>Thus I have in ſome poor meaſure, open'd the Viſion recorded in my Text: I come now to apply it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us with Admiration behold the <hi>Glory of Chriſt.</hi> The Prince of Peace is a Man of War; and how glorious is he in this Character!

How glorious does he appear in his Martial Equipage, <hi>riding upon a red Horſe,</hi> and having <hi>behind him, red Horſes, ſpeckled and white</hi>

behind him. It was a Credit to <hi>David,</hi> his illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious Type, that he had ſo many valiant Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, renowned Worthies, under his Command: They were called <hi>David's mighty Men, David's Worthies</hi>: How much more honourable is the Lord Jeſus, who hath under his Command an innumerable Company of Angels, the loweſt Rank of which far excells <hi>David's firſt Three,</hi> in warlike Accompliſhments and Atchievements? If a Man were the Captain of Nobles, of Princes and Kings, would he not be admired as a <hi>great General?</hi> Conſider then, how great the Man Chriſt Jeſus is at the head of all the <hi>Train-bands</hi> of Heaven, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Powers, Cherubim and Seraphim following him! — Is there any Number of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? — <hi>WHO IS THIS KING OF GLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY? THE LORD STRONG AND MIGHTY, THE LORD MIGHTY IN BATTLE. — WHO IS THIS KING OF GLORY? THE LORD OF HOSTS, HE IS THE KING OF GLORY. SELAH.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The Viſion ſpeaks terror</hi> to the Enemies of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of his People. To ſuch the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus appeareth very formidable, riding upon a red Horſe, and having behind him red Horſes, ſpeck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and white. Is there any Army of Men with Banners ſo terrible as this, which the Viſion repreſents? Wo to them, who ſight againſt ſo victorious and invincible a Captain as Jeſus Chriſt is, and who oppoſe his mighty Angels! He will ſprinkle all his Raiment, and die his Horſe, with the blood of his Enemies. Who would ſet the Briers and Thorns againſt him in Battle? he will go through them, and burn them

together: for he maketh his Angels Spirits, thoſe Miniſters of his a <hi>flame of fire,</hi> to conſume the Adverſaries. All <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Enemies ſhall break, ſhall ſcatter and flee before him, when he ſhall ariſe againſt them. He ſhall ſtrike thro' Kings in the Day of his Wrath, — he ſhall fill the places with the dead bodies: — he ſhall wound the heads over many Countries. — The time is haſtning, when the Kings of the Earth, the great Men, the chief Captains, the mighty Men, and all that are in open hoſtility againſt Chriſt, ſhall ſeek to hide themſelves in the Dens, and in the Rocks of the Mountains; and ſay to the Mountains and Rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſitteth on the Throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb: for the great Day of his Wrath is come; and who ſhall be able to ſtand? O! let not any of us be found among his Enemies. Luk. 14.31, 32. <hi>What King going to make War againſt another King, ſitteth not down firſt, and Conſulteth, whether he be able with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to meet him that cometh againſt him with twenty thouſand? Or elſe, while the other is yet a great way off, he ſendeth an Ambaſſage, and deſireth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Peace.</hi> Let us conſult, and do ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for we are not able with all our Strength, no, nor with all the confederate Forces of Hell, to meet him, who is coming againſt his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with twenty thouſand Chariots and Horſes, even Thouſands of Angels.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>The Viſion</hi> affords much Comfort to the People of God, <hi>even when they are in a low Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> This Viſion was firſt granted for the Comfort and Encouragement of the poor depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Jews,</hi> that were ſurrounded with Enemies;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003030_0024_0FEFAF7EF9150598"/>
but it looks farther than unto them, and ſpeaks Comfort to all the true <hi>Iſrael of God.</hi> The great red Dragon and his Angels thirſt for the Blood of Saints, and with reſtleſs Rage ſeek to devour them: But the Captain of our Salvation <hi>rideth on a red Horſe,</hi> cometh with Speed and Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to protect and ſave his People. He is Jealous for them with great Jealouſy; he is red with Anger, and his Eyes do flame with Vengeance againſt their Enemies; whoſe Blood ſhall be ſprinkled on every thing he uſeth in War againſt them. — The Righteous ſhall rejoyce, when they ſee the Vengeance, and ſhall waſh their Feet in the Blood of the Wicked. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Captain of the Lord's Hoſt, hath innumerable Squadrons of Angels behind him, under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and which he employs for the Defence and Deliverance of his People; therefore, let them not be diſmayed at the Number, or Strength of their Enemies; for they that be with them are more and mightier than thoſe which be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. There are Horſes and Chariots of Fire round about them, for their Protection when they are brought low, and ſeem to be over-top'd by the Mountains of wicked Men, their haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſtrong and ſtubborn Enemies, which encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs them; even then may they receive great Comfort from this Viſion. The <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> is with them, and <hi>the worm Jacob</hi> need not fear, for his Redeemer will help him, ſo that he ſhall threſh the Mountains, and beat them ſmall. <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. 41.15.</note> When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſlew the <hi>Syrians</hi> with a great Slaughter, the Servants of <hi>Benhadad</hi> encourag'd him to renew the Battle, ſaying, <hi>Their Gods are

            <p n="4">IV. From what hath been ſaid, Thoſe of the <hi>Military Order</hi> may be exhorted and incited to the Duties of their <hi>Station.</hi> — It hath from the days of our Fathers been the laudable, religious Practice of the <hi>Honourable Company,</hi> the Chief of our <hi>Militia,</hi> who have now invited us into the <hi>Houſe of the Lord,</hi> thus ſolemnly to wait upon him, that ſo their Military Exerciſes and Affairs might be <hi>Sanctified by the Word of God, and Prayer</hi>: And altho' the <hi>Subject</hi> which hath been treated on at this Time by the <hi>leaſt of Chriſt's Miniſters,</hi> (who could think of no other but what hath been exhauſted on this <hi>Occaſion)</hi> may ſeem not to be well choſen; yet is it pregnant of wholeſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction unto <hi>Soldiers,</hi> and affords proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements and Incentives to the Duties of their Calling. — By viewing the <hi>Angelick-Artillery,</hi> the <hi>Celeſtial Cavalcade,</hi> which the Viſion exhibits

            <p n="1">1. Let them be exhorted to liſt under the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of the <hi>glorious Captain,</hi> and ſo join themſelves to the <hi>excellent Company,</hi> ſpoken of in our Text. There are two Generals with their Armies that divide the whole World; <hi>Michael and his Angels,</hi> and <hi>the Dragon and his Angels,</hi> Rev. 12.7. By <hi>Michael</hi> here is intended <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; and his Angels are not only thoſe who are ſo by Nature, but all ſuch alſo as do engage in his Service, and are ſent forth by him. By the <hi>Dragon</hi> is meant the <hi>Prince of Devils</hi>; and his Angels are not only Infernal Spirits, but all Men on Earth which are Confederate with them, in Warring againſt the Church. The Man whom the Prophet ſaw rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a red Horſe, and the great red Dragon are the two mighty Commanders, under whoſe diſtinguiſhing <hi>Colours</hi> all do fight. They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Captains, to the one or other of which we do belong. — Now, who will not be on the Lords ſide?

Let <hi>Holineſs to the Lord of Hoſts be</hi> written upon all your Weapons of War. May the <hi>Spirit</hi> come on you now, as it did on <hi>Amaſai,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>Thine are we,</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>and on thy ſide, thou Son of</hi> Jeſſe: <hi>Peace, Peace be unto thee, and Peace be to thine helpers, for thy God helpeth thee</hi>

Say unto him, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did unto <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua,</hi> his Type, <hi>All that thou commandeſt us to do, we will do; and whitherſoever thou ſendeſt us, we will go</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Joſh. 1.16.</note>. The glorious Angels count it their Honour to be behind the Man riding on a red Horſe; and will any of you diſdain to be ſo? Is it not a high Privilege to be joined to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Company of Angels?— Behold, God hath given his Son for a <hi>Leader</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander to the People</hi>; and will you not thankfully and joyfully accept and own him to be yours? How happy will you be under the Conduct of ſo wiſe a Leader, ſo great a Commander, as the

Lord Jeſus is, and in ſuch a valiant glorious Company, as that of the angelical Hoſt behind him?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Having liſted your ſelves under the <hi>Banner</hi> of Chriſt, prepare for the <hi>Service</hi> which he may call you forth unto. You ſhould not profeſs your ſelves his Soldiers, unleſs you deſign and reſolve, that whenever there ſhall be Occaſion therefor, and a Call thereto, you will fight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Banner. Since your Captain appears on a red Horſe, you may look for bloody Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with his and his People's Enemies, and ſhould furniſh your ſelves with Skill to fight the <hi>Lord's Battles.</hi> The happy Time is expected, in which Men ſhall beat their Swords into Plough-ſhares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks: Nation ſhall not lift up Sword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn War any more <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. 2.4.</note>. But, till that peaceful Period arrive, the <hi>Art of War</hi> is not to be laid aſide as uſeleſs by a Chriſtian People. War ſhould be learnt, when there is no preſent Occaſion for the Practice of it. Thoſe of the military Order ſhould ſtudy this Art, and be Men expert in War. Cant. 3.7, 8. <hi>Behold, his Bed, which is Solomon's, three ſcore valiant Men are about it, of the valiant of Iſrael. They all hold Swords, being expert in War.</hi> The Bed of him whom <hi>Solomon</hi> typified, is the <hi>Church</hi>; Not only Magiſtrates and Miniſters, but Soldiers alſo, are appointed to guard and defend it: and it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that they be Men of Valor, and <hi>expert in War.</hi>— Military Skill is a good Gift, that cometh down from the <hi>Father of Lights:</hi> It is to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003030_0029_0FEFAF8AC9C70958"/>
be obtain'd of him by Induſtry, and the praiſe of it to be rendred unto him. Pſal. 144.1. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the Lord my Strength, which teacheth my Hands to War, and my Fingers to Fight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a Glory to a People, and a Defence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all their Glory, to have Men skilful in War: And on the other Hand, ignorant, undiſciplin'd Soldiers are always a Reproach to, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Ruin of a People.— Is it not faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Negligence in thoſe of the Military Order amongſt us, that the moſt of them take ſo little Care to furniſh themſelves with proper and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Skill, and do remain ſo great ſtrangers to the <hi>Art of War,</hi> and that too many who ſhou'd be able to teach it others, need themſelves to be taught which be the firſt principles of it?— The reviving of the Military Spirit, which hath for many Years languiſhed among us, ſhould be endeavoured; <hi>Eſpecially</hi> in the Reign of a puiſſant, yet peaceable <hi>King,</hi> who is renown'd for his early and exemplary acquaintance with the Art of War; which is one of his bright Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be a <hi>tutelar Angel</hi> unto his loyal People, over which God hath ſet him, <hi>and we pray long to continue him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In Obedience to your great Commander, and Conformity to the bleſſed Angels, <hi>willingly go forth to War,</hi> whenever ye ſhall be called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. — We are bound to thank God, for the happy proſpect which there is at this Day of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Peace in <hi>Europe</hi>; and for his Bleſſing on the prudent meaſures of this <hi>Government,</hi> whereby Peace is eſtabliſhed in our <hi>Borders.</hi> But we know not how ſoon we muſt hear the Alarm of War
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:003030_0030_0FEFAF8D32691338"/>
again: And if you ſhould be called to jeopard your Lives in the high places of the Field, or Thickets of the Wilderneſs, remember that you are Voluntiers in the Service of the God-man riding on a red Horſe, and you muſt follow him whitherſoever he leadeth you. — Do not Cowardly ſtay at home, when he calls you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, but readily go forth to fight for the Cities of our God. Avoid the <hi>Curſe of Meroz,</hi> the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants whereof, the <hi>Angel of the Lord ſaid, Curſe ye bitterly</hi>

            <p>It is a Work, in it ſelf conſider'd, very unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable and melancholly, to deſtroy the Lives of your fellow-Creatures. Malice ſhou'd not be your Motive to it, nor the glutting of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge make it pleaſant to you. It ſhould not be your Sport and Paſtime, to kill Men whom ye ought to love, and diſpatch to Eternity thoſe who, you may fear, are unprovided for it. He that loveth his Neighbour as himſelf, and bleſſeth, and doth good to his Enemies, will take it heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be employ'd in killing of them, even when urgent Neceſſity and the evident Call of God make it his Duty. Yet, Obedience to your great Commander ſhou'd be always delightful to you, and the good and ſafety of his People be chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and vigorouſly purſued by you.</p>
            <p>The holy Angels, to whom ye join yourſelves, and with whom ye go forth in a juſt War, and whom ye are to imitate in doing the Will of God
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003030_0031_0FEFAF907111A540"/>
on Earth, readily execute the Orders of their and your glorious Commander, when he ſends them on the Errands of his Vengeance. Ezek. 9.5, 6, 7. <hi>To the others he ſaid in mine hearing, go ye after him through the City, and ſmite: let not your Eye ſpare, neither have ye pity. Slay utterly old and young, both Maids, and little Children, and Women — defile the Houſe, and fill the Courts with the Slain, go ye forth; and they went forth and ſlew in the City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. If you ſhou'd be called into the Field of Battle, <hi>fight as it becomes thoſe,</hi> who are under the Conduct of the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> and in the Company of his mighty Angels.</p>
            <p>To be led into the Field by a victorious Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and with valiant Soldiers, may well animate the greateſt Coward to fight. When Chriſtian Soldiers go forth to War in a juſt Cauſe, they may by Faith ſee the <hi>Man riding on a red Horſe,</hi> a glorious Captain, an invincible Hero, before them as their <hi>Leader</hi>; and behind him, the <hi>red Horſes, ſpeckled and white,</hi> the mighty Angels of God, as their <hi>Fellow-ſoldiers</hi>: And this may well inſpire them with Courage, and make them wax valiant in fight.— Courage is a neceſſary Qualification of a Soldier; the greateſt Skill and Strength without it, are of little uſe in War: The Exerciſe of it is difficult, when a Man looks a potent Enemy in the Face, and marcheth into the Mouth of Danger, heareth the roaring Canons and Guns, and the confuſed horrible Noiſe with which every Battle of the Warrior is attended; ſeeth the glittering Sword brandiſhed, and multitudes fall on his right hand
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003030_0032_0FEFAF92F09C1398"/>
and on his left, rouling their Garments in blood. "The heathen Moraliſts reckoned bravery in War, to be the higheſt expreſſion of Courage, and that the Soldier had the greateſt Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſhew Courage, becauſe Life, the deareſt thing in this World, is riſqued in War." Now, Chriſtian Soldiers have the greateſt Incentive to Valour, they fighting under ſuch a Captain, and in ſuch a Company, as the Viſion repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerves concerning <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Soldiers, that they who in Service under other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, did not exceed the ordinary Rate of Courage, nor excel their Fellows, did yet when <hi>he</hi> led them, become irreſiſtibly valiant, being animated and inſpired by his unparallel'd Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry.</p>
            <p>Behold, a greater than <hi>Caeſar</hi> leads the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Soldiers, and the mighty Angels are with them in a <hi>holy War</hi>; the conſideration of which may render the moſt daſtardly Spirit bold and adventurous. The exemplary Valour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Force of ſo great a General and Hoſt, may infuſe Courage into the moſt timorous and faint-hearted, and make him that is feeble to be as <hi>David.</hi> 2 Chron. 32.7, 8. <hi>Be ſtrong and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, be not afraid, nor diſmayed for the King of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him. With him is an Arm of fleſh, but with us is the Lord our God, to help us, and to fight our Battles.</hi> The <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the Enemies of God's People, <hi>are Men, and not God; and their Horſes, fleſh, and not ſpirit</hi>

            <p n="5">5. <hi>Take heed,</hi> that your whole <hi>Behaviour may pleaſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> under whoſe Banner ye liſt, and the holy Angels alſo, the Coeleſtial Company, to which ye join yourſelves.

The <hi>Angelic Legions</hi> behind him do ſo; <hi>they do his Commandments, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening unto the voice of his Word</hi>: And they are exhibited as a Pattern for your Imitation. With ſpeed and chearfulneſs obey every Word of Command, that ye receive from the Mouth of ſo glorious a Captain; and do nothing without, or contrary to his Order. Be always upon your Guard againſt Sin. Arm your ſelves againſt thoſe Temptations unto it, with which Soldiers eſpecially are aſſaulted, and too often over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.— Watch againſt Sin in your <hi>prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Exerciſes:</hi> On Days ſet apart therefor, run not into exceſs of Riot, as the Practice of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hath been: Serve not your Luſts, which war againſt your Souls, and the grand Enemy of God and Man, while you pretend to be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your ſelves for the Service of Chriſt, your King and Country.— And if you ſhould go forth to War, keep your ſelves from every evil thing: Let there be no accurſed thing in the

And he ſaid unto them, Do violence to no Man, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accuſe any falſly, and be content with your Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi>— You are intirely dependent on Chriſt for Safety and Succeſs: This <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> is for Strength to them that turn the Battle to the Gate. It is your Wiſdom therefore to take heed unto your ſelves, leſt ye ſhould in any Action of yours diſpleaſe him.— And herein Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers muſt exerciſe themſelves, that they may be void of Offence toward God and Man, and Angels alſo.
