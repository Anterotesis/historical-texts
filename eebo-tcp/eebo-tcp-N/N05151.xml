            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I HAVE had an Opportunity to read your Letter, which (you ſay,) you ſhould have directed to my Brother, if he had been living; but is now directed to me. You mention many bad Conſequences, which you ſuppoſe are deducible from our Doctrines; eſpecially concerning God's Decrees. But in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to know whether theſe Conſequences are juſt, or whether they are peculiar to our Principles, it will be neceſſary, that the Caſe be fairly ſtated. I ſhall therefore preſent you with a Scheme, of the Principles of each Party; in as plain and as undiſguiſed a Manner as I can. But here I would premiſe, there are two general Principles, which both Parties are agreed in; that may help us very much in our Inquiry into the Conſequences of thoſe Principles in which we differ. <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That God never acts <hi>inadvertently,</hi> without any Purpoſe or Deſign, and therefore whatever God does, he certainly decreed to do. And, 2. That the Sovereignty of God, is not <hi>(alogon)</hi> an <hi>unreaſonable</hi> Dominion; and therefore his Decrees are agreeable to all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of an infinitely perfect Being. Having premiſed this; I ſhall place the <hi>Principles,</hi> in which we differ, in two oppoſite Columns, that they may be the more eaſily compar'd together.</p>

            <p n="1">1 <q>The firſt Conſequence (you ſay, p. 2.)

If their eternal Salvation is eternally Decreed, all the Means, and ſteps in Order to it are decreed likewiſe.

            <p>Upon which I obſerve, that your whole Argument turns on this Principle; that God's Decrees, do neceſſarily influence the decreed Event.

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006483_0008_10290DAEFA933958"/>God's Decree of Election is powerful, and active, and comprehends the Preparation, and Exhibition of ſuch Means; as ſhall unfruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly produce the End. And his Decree of Reprobation is active, as far as Action is required, to render any Man deficient, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſinful of Neceſſity.</q> And Mr. <hi>Beach</hi> delivers his Sentiments in the ſame Words, with the Addition of ſome very odd Expreſſions.

Almoſt all Mr. <hi>Beach</hi>'s long String of Conſequences (1ſt Reply p. 62<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 63, 64, 65, 66.) are founded upon this Principle, that God's Decrees do influence the Event.

            <p>A very Child in the Knowledge of Divinity, who is unprejudiced, could have told you that <hi>Praedeſtinatio nihil ponit in praedeſtinato.</hi> The Decrees of God are immanent, and not tranſient Acts, in the divine Mind. Until God reveals his Decrees, they are known <hi>to no Man: no not to the Angels that are in Heaven, nor to Chriſt himſelf as he is Man, but to the Father only.</hi> What are God's Decrees, but his Purpoſe to act or ſuſpend acting; when, and where, and how, he in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom ſees ſit? Now does our Purpoſe to do any Thing give Birth to the Event, which is brought to paſs by us? No, it is only our acting according to our Purpoſe, that has any kind of Influence, in producing the Event. 'Tis true, God does influence every good Event, according to his Decrees. <hi>'Tis in him that we live, and move, and have our Beings: And it is God that works in us that which it well pleaſing in his ſight.</hi> But how does he work in us?

And if ſo, <q>then as the firſt Link of a Chain put in Motion, influences and moves all the intermediate Links; ſo the primary Decree influences all the intermediate Cauſes, Means, and Steps, to the final Event?</q> I anſwer, No, God never does any Thing becauſe he has decreed to do it. The Reaſon why God has decreed to do any thing, is, becauſe it a agreeable to his infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to do ſo. It is beyond our Capacity many Times, to know the Reaſon of the divine Conduct: But it is certain, God does not Act in an unreaſonable Manner. Wilful and unreaſonable Men ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, do Things for no other Reaſon, but becauſe they have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to do them; and that is for no Reaſon at all. But God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, that we ſhould attribute Folly to our Maker; by imagining, that he will do Things meerly becauſe he will do them.

            </p>
            <p>But you ſay (P. 5.) <q>Perſons ſtriving after Salvation, does not render it at all more likely that they ſhall obtain it, than their being for the preſent utterly careleſs and negligent:</q> And a great deal more to the ſame Purpoſe. But there is juſt thus much in all that you argue upon this Head; that ſince it is <hi>God who works in you both to will, and to do, according to his own good Pleaſure;</hi> i. e. accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Decrees; therefore you will not <hi>work out your own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Fear, and Trembling.</hi> God has decreed to never work Faith and Holineſs in you, before you are brought to ſee the need of it, and to earneſtly ſeek it, and therefore you need not be concerned about it, ſince it is God who muſt work in you according to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, if ever you are ſaved; therefore if you are elected, God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees will ſave you, whether he works in you or not.</p>
            <p>But you ſuggeſt, <q>There is a neceſſary Connection between the primary Decree, and the Event.</q> I anſwer, there is none at all, any more than between God's Fore-knowledge, and the Thing fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, In a Word, all that can be argued from our Principles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Election, is no more than this; <hi>viz.</hi> that if God does not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Purpoſe and Deſign, work Grace and Holineſs in us, we never ſhall be ſaved: for God can't qualify us for Heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out determining to do it.

And therefore unleſs you are <hi>made meet for an Inheritance among the Saints in Light,</hi> by the Spirit of Holineſs, you muſt lye down in Sorrow.</p>

            <p>But I anſwer, it is impoſſible that this Conſequence can follow from our Principles concerning God's Decrees; becauſe we don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, there are any Decrees, that have any manner of Efficiency in producing any Event at all; much leſs any ſinful Event.

               </gap> your own Principles. The <hi>Arminians</hi> all believe, that God does ſend the Non-Elect into the World involved in Sin and Miſery; (which I ſhall make appear under another Head.) They believe, that God leaves them to innumerable ſtrong Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and that he permits them to live according to their ungodly Luſts, and to die impenitent; and that he will puniſh them eternally for their Sins. Now you muſt own, unleſs you would blaſpheme the God who is above, that God never does any Thing without Counſel and Deſign, and therefore whatever God does, he certainly decreed to do. This Dr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> obeſerves, (Defence of <hi>Ariſtocles,</hi> p. 21) <q>The right Way of judging of God's Decrees, is by Facts before our Eyes — For what God does, he doubtleſs decreed to do.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore God does ſend the Non-Elect into the World in a ſinful and miſerable State, and does permit them to live in Sin, <hi>and treaſure up Wrath, againſt the Day of Wrath;</hi> you muſt believe, that God has decreed to do ſo. Now then if the Decrees of God have a direct In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and Efficiency in producing the Event (as you ſay they have;) the Conſequence does neceſſarily follow, that if your are not elected, you are under an abſolute Neceſſity, antecedent to any actual Guilt, of being Damned.

But you argue, <q>If the Guilt of our firſt Parents Sin ſhould be imputed to their Poſterity, and that an intire, and univerſal Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Nature ſhould be brought upon them as a Puniſhment of this imputed Guilt, — then the Decree has a direct Influence and Efficiency in putting the Non Elect into an irrecoverable ſtate of Sin and Damnation.</q> But pray Sir, how will it help the Caſe of the Non-Elect, though it be ſuppoſed that God decreed to bring them into the World with an intire and univerſal Depravity of Nature, not as a Puniſhment for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, but for ſome other unknown Reaſon? — Why has not this Decree as direct and Influence and Efficiency to put them into a ſtate of Sin and Damnation as if it was done as a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for the Sin of their firſt Parents? The <hi>Arminians</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the intire and univerſal Depravity of Nature, (as will be further conſidered.) And it God decreed to leave them to live and die in Sin, and to puniſh them for it; And if this Decree has a neceſſary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and Efficiency in producing the Event; then they are put into an irrecoverable ſtate of Sin and Damnation, ſure enough! But you'll tell me, I conclude, that according to your Principles God has given the Non-Elect <hi>Grace ſufficient</hi> to ſubdue their Luſts and overcome all Temptations; ſo that it is in their own Power to believe, and repent, and obtain Salvation. Nevertheleſs you had as good ſay Nothing: for, ſuppoſing that Graceleſs Men, have Grace ſufficient to obtain Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, yet according to your Principle, that God's Decrees neceſſarily influence the Event, the eternal State of the Non Elect was fixed, Millions of Ages before they had any Opportunity to exerciſe their ſufficient Grace.

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Here I obſerve, your Arguments to prove the Conſequences, which you mention under this Head, turn upon. two Points, <hi>viz.</hi> I. What you ſuppoſe we believe concerning human <hi>Impotency,</hi> and, 2. From what you think to be our Opinion concerning God's <hi>Decrees.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us, (you ſay, p. 9.) <q>'Tis as impoſſible for Men to convert themſelves, as it is for them to create a Word. And it is intirely agreeable with our Doctrine, (you ſay,) that the Non-Elect ſhall never have Grace to convert them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What concerns your Arguments, taken from our Opinion of human Impotency, will more properly fall under the 4th Head, and ſhall there be ſully conſidered. But what I ſhall now conſider, is the Force of your Arguments, to prove you Conſequences taken from our Opinion of God's Decrees; <hi>viz.</hi> that it is impoſſible the Non-Elect ſhould accept of an offered Saviour, becauſe God has decreed not to give them Grace to comply with the Terms of the Goſpel. — But as we firmly believe, that the Decrees of God have no more Influence or Efficiency in producing any Event, than if there were no Decrees at all; ſurely this Conſequence can never follow from our Principles. But this very Conſequence does directly follow from your Doctrine, that God's Decrees do neceſſarily influence the Event. If I ſhould aſk here, what are the Conditions upon which the Benefits of Chriſt's Redemption are offered to the Non Elect? You would tell me, Faith and Repentance: and not that univerſal Grace (or Light) which the <hi>Quakers</hi> and you talk of. If I ſhould enquire again, whether Faith and Repentance be not the <hi>Gift of God? You would anſwer, Yes: <hi>It is God who works in us all the good Pleaſure of his Grace, and the Work of Faith with Power.</hi> And if I ſhould demand once more, whether God does in Fact leave the Non-Elect to die without Faith, and Repentance? You would anſwer, yes. Well then, what God does he certainly decreed to do. If therefore God decreed to leave the Non Elect to die without Faith and Repentance; and if there be (as you aſſert) a neceſſary Concatenation of Cauſes between the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Decree, and the Event decreed, then this Conſequence will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly follow, that Faith in a Redeemer is an impoſſible Condition. If
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006483_0013_10290DF8B837EC08"/>the Non-Elect have it not, and God decreed to not give it, but to let them die without it, and this Decree had a neceſſary Efficiency in producing the Event, (as you ſay it has; then Chriſt never died for the Non-Elect any more than for the fallen Angels. Chriſt never was in earneſt offered to them (if your Principles are true,) For an Offer upon an impoſſible Condition is no Offer at all. The Non-Elect never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe redeeming Mercy, (if God's Decrees influence the Event,) and will never be puniſhed for their neglecting the great Salvation! Dear Sir, what monſtrous Opinions do you ſeem to hold! Muſt the God of Truth, be charged with Inſincerity, in all his condeſcending and gracious Offers, Invitations, and Encouragements, rather than you'll part with your unaccountable Doctrine of neceſſitating Decrees! — But as <hi>we</hi> believe, there are no ſuch Decrees;</hi> ſo we believe, the Terms of Salvation are the ſame for all Men, Elect or Non-Elect. <hi>There is but one Faith, one Lord, one Baptiſm, one Hope of our Calling. He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved: And be that believeth not, ſhall be damned.</hi> Notwithſtanding any Influence that the Decrees of God have upon the Non Elect: it is every Whit as eaſy for them to accept of an offered Saviour as for the Elect. Theſe, Sir, Theſe are our Principles, founded upon all the Declarations of the Goſpel. And therefore as Ambaſſadors of Chriſt, we proclaim and offer to all Men, Elect, or Non-Elect, <hi>Whoſo will, let him come, and taks of the Waters of Life freely.</hi> — But</p>
            <p>III. <q>The third general Conſequence (you ſay p. 11.) is, that the <hi>Impenitence</hi> of the <hi>Non-Elect,</hi> or their not complying with the Goſpel-Terms of Salvation, is <hi>not their own actual Fault,</hi> but is purely the Effect of <hi>Original Sin.</hi> 'Tis all the natural and neceſſary Effect of imputed Guilt; or the Sin of their firſt Parents charged upon them, and puniſhed in them; and this in ſuch a Manner, as to take off all actual Fault and Blame from them. And hence you argue, that they will be puniſhed only for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin imputed to them, or propagated in them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, all the Conſequences which you mention under this Head, and ſuppoſe to be deducible from our Doctrine of Original Sin, does as much follow from the common Belief of every Sect of Men calling themſelves Chriſtians; whether <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> (the <hi>Socinians</hi> only excepted.) The Doctrine of original Sin has been received, and defended in the Chriſtian Church, in all the ſucceſſive Ages of it. In the council of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> (Anno 415.) the Opinion of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and his Adherents who denied Original Sin, was condemned as a grievous Hereſy. The Opinion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with Reſpect to this
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006483_0014_10290DBA2D04EED0"/>Doctrine, may be known by the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent:</hi> By which they pronounce an Anathema, (1.) <q>Againſt him which confeſſeth not, that <hi>Adam</hi> by tranſgreſſing hath loſt Sanctity and Juſtice, incurred the Wrath of God, Death, and Thraldom to the Devil: And is infected in Soul, and Body. (2.) Againſt him which averreth that <hi>Adam</hi> by ſinning, hath hurt himſelf only, or hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived unto his Poſterity the Death only of the Body, and not Sin, the Death of the Soul. (3.) Againſt him which affirmeth, that Sin, which is one in the Beginning, and proper to every one, tranſmitted by Generation, not Imitation, can be aboliſhed by any other Remedy than the Death of Chriſt.</q> (See <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> p. 184.) — The general Opinion of all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> may be known, by the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Confeſſion; which Mr. <hi>Beach</hi> ſays, <q>his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tells him he heartily believes,</q> 2d Reply p. 37. In which (beſides what my Brother cited,) we have theſe Words, and more to the ſame Purpoſe. <q>We mean by <hi>Original Sin;</hi> that which the holy Fathers, and all of ſound Judgment in the Church, do ſo call; namely, that <hi>Guilt</hi> whereby all that come into the World, are through <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, ſubject to God's Wrath, and eternal Death: And that very <hi>Corruption</hi> of Man's Nature derived from <hi>Adam.</hi> And this Corruption of Man's Nature, comprehendeth both the Defect of original Juſtice, Integrity, and Obedience, and alſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence— Wherefore theſe Defects, and this Concupiſcence, are Things Damnable, and of their own Nature worthy of Death.</q> (<hi>Harm.</hi> of Confeſſ. p. 73.) — And the <hi>Arminians</hi> profeſs, that they believe the intire and univerſal Depravity of human Nature, as much as we do. If you charge the <hi>Arminians</hi> with denying Original Sin; Mr. <hi>Beach</hi> (whoſe Principles you have undertaken to defend,) will tell you; It is an horrid Slander. My Brother having ſtated the Doctrine of Original Sin, in as ſtrong Terms as any <hi>Calviniſts</hi> believe it; Mr. <hi>Beach</hi> ſays, (2d Reply p. 26.) <q>I won't ſay, I <hi>believe</hi> this, but I <hi>know</hi> it by Experience, and though Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> has accuſed me of denying Original Sin; yet, for ought I can learn from theſe two Books, I believe Original Sin in a more <hi>rigid</hi> Senſe than he did.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Arminians</hi> have ('tis true) a different Way of explaining this Doctrine, (which I ſhall have Occaſion to conſider;) but yet if they don't really believe it, we muſt think them ſome of the moſt aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned Men in the World. <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelf, and all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines that followed him (as far as I am acquainted with the Caſe) did all profeſs their Belief of it. And the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> among which are many in the <hi>Arminian</hi> Way of thinking, do all of them make the moſt publick and ſolemn Profeſſion of their Belief of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006483_0015_10290DFD312AF1D0"/>this Doctrine; and in as ſtrong Terms as any <hi>Calviniſt</hi> can do. If you tell me, that they ſay a great many Things againſt it, and endeavour to draw a great many bad Conſequences from it, and charge them upon the <hi>Calviniſts;</hi> I can't help that, I am not accountable for their Inconſiſtences. But if you think, they be not ſincere (in their Profeſſion) you ought to look upon it, not only as a ſad Inſtance of the Depravity of human Nature; but likewiſe of the bad Influence of <hi>Arminian</hi> Principles. In the 9th <hi>Article</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they profeſs they believe; <q>Original Sin ſtandeth not in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Adam,</hi> as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> vainly talk: But it is the Fault, and Corruption, of the Nature of every Man, that naturally is ingendered of the Off ſpring of <hi>Adam;</hi> whereby Man is very far gone from original Righteouſneſs, and is of his own Nature inclined to Evil. — And therefore in every Perſon, born into this World, it deſerveth God's Wrath and Damnation — And that Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, and Luſt hath of itſelf the Nature of Sin.</q> And they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs they believe, that ſuch is the intire, and univerſal Depravity of Nature, that we have no Power naturally to do that which is Good. As in <hi>Art.</hi> 10, <q>The Condition of Man ſince the Fall is ſuch, — We have no Power to do good Works, pleaſant and acceptable to God, without the Grace of God by Chriſt preventing us; that we may have a good Will, and Working with us, when we have that good Will</q> And not only ſo, but they have ſuch an Opinion of the dreadful State of Sin and Wickedneſs, all Men are naturally in; that they profeſs they believe, All Works done by Men before they are truly juſtified, by the Grace of Chriſt, — are ſo far from being pleaſing to God, that they have the Nature of Sin. <hi>Art.</hi> 13. Where then is the Propriety of charging Conſequences upon our <hi>Calviniſtic</hi> Doctrine of Original Sin, as though it was peculiar to us, when in Fact the <hi>Arminians</hi> profeſs they believe it in as ſtrong Terms as we do? And indeed the intire and univerſal Depravity of human Nature, is what has been complained of in all Ages, and in all Places, not only by the Chriſtians, and Jews, but by the very Heathens themſelves. <hi>The whole World lies in Wickedneſs,</hi> (notwithſtanding what you talk, of their having Grace ſufficient for Salvation:) And the original Fountain, from whence ſprings all that Flood of Wickedneſs, that covers the whole Face of the Earth, is their natural Corruption. — You don't ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that I ſhould now undertake to ſhow the Juſtice, and Equity of God's puniſhing us for the Sin of our firſt Parents: Or to prove from the Word of <hi>God, that both Jews and Gentiles are all under Sin, and by Nature Children of Wrath; being ſhapen in Iniquity, and conceived in Sin; which entered into the World by one Man, of whom all have ſinned.</hi> The Way and Manner how Sin came to be propagated, is not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006483_0016_10290DBBB77D17E8"/>Queſtion. But that Mankind are naturally in a ſinful, and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved State, is granted by all Chriſtians: (for I don't think the <hi>Socinians</hi> deſerve that Name.) But whether this will excuſe Men in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing impenitent, and ſo living, and dying in a Courſe of Rebellion againſt God; I ſhall conſider under the following Head.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <q>The next general Conſequence, which you ſhall take Notice of, (you ſay p. 20.) as flowing from our Doctrine, is, that the <hi>Non-Elect</hi> were never in a State of <hi>Probation.</hi> They never had a Time of Tryal; whether they would comply with the Terms of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or not: For antecedent to their being capable Subjects of ſuch a Tryal, they were laid under an Impoſſibility of ever being willing to comply.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I obſerve here, all your Arguments under this Head turn upon what you take to be our Opinion concerning God's Decrees, and our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning human Impotency. So far as this Conſequence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the Decrees of God; I have to ſay, this very Conſequence does certainly follow from your Opinion, that God's Decrees do neceſſarily influence the Event. Upon your own Principles, <q>the Non-Elect have no time of Tryal, any more than the fallen Angels, and are no more to blame than if they had no Time of Probation:</q> For if God decreed to do what he certainly does do) leave them to live and die in Sin, and if there be a neceſſary Concatenation of Cauſes, between the Decree, and final Event, (as you ſay there is;) what time of Tryal can they have? What muſt they try to do? Overturn the Pillars of Heaven! And change an Event that is fixed by an Almighty Decree! But as I obſerved before, with Reſpect to your other Conſequences, ſo I ſay now; this Conſequence can't in any Reſpect follow from our Opinion concerning the Decrees; becauſe we do not believe there are any Decrees, that have any manner of Influence, in putting Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind into a State of natural Blindneſs and Hardneſs of Heart; or to render them in any Reſpect uncapable to comply with the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall examine your Arguments, to prove that the Conſequence you mention, does follow from our Opinion of our natural Inability to believe and repent. We do believe (as you obſerve,) that Men are as unable to convert themſelves, without the ſpecial Influences of God's holy Spirit, as to make a new World. But only there is this Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: in one Caſe there is a natural Impoſſibility, and in the other only a Moral. <q>But (you ſay p. 23.) what would you think of a Syſtem of Religion built upon ſuch an Hypotheſis? Suppoſe you were conveyed to another Race of fallen Creatures, and you ſhould
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006483_0017_10290E0040C12938"/>hear one of the Preachers addreſſing the People in this Manner; O fallen Creatures, fallen through the Imputation of your firſt Parents Sin! You are reduced to a miſerable Condition; you are expoſed to Puniſhment here, and to a greater hereafter: But now I propoſe it to you, that if you will but only create a new World, you ſhall be freed from this Miſery, and obtain Happineſs. You have a Time of Probation allowed you, you have an Opportunity in your Hands of making Tryal. If you let ſlip this Opportunity, you are infinitely to blame, and will be miſerable for ever, with this aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating Circumſtance, that you refuſed Happineſs, when offered to you upon the reaſonable Terms of making a World.</q> You inquire, what I think of ſuch an Offer? I anſwer, ſuppoſing the bleſſed God had given them ſufficient Encouragement, that upon their uſing ſuitable Endeavours to make a new World, he would exert a divine Power to enable them to do it; and ſuppoſing he had appointed Means that would never fail of being Effectual, if they were not abuſed; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing alſo that many of them upon uſing the appointed Means, had actually been enabled to do it; I would ſay, they were ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, if they did not do it; but would periſh when ſo reaſonable an Offer was made to them. If God had told <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he and all the People would certainly periſh by the Hands of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> if he did not comply with the reaſonable Condition of ſtretching forth his Rod, and dividing the red Sea: What if <hi>Moſes</hi> had anſwered, "The Condition of our Deliverance is an impoſſible Condition; and an Offer made upon ſuch a Condition, is no Offer at all. The Sea is a Mile wide, and there is a vaſt Body of Waters; I can't ſtop the leaſt Brook, without a great deal of Pains, and Labour. But ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal as this, was never made to any Man before, ſince the World began; and I am as able to make a new World as to do it. This is only to inſult and tantalize us in our Miſery, and Danger." Would <hi>Moſes</hi> have done well, to argue after this Manner; and ſo neglect the Means by which this Event was to be accompliſhed? And ſo in the preſent Caſe; though Men are under an utter moral Impoſſibility to convert themſelves; yet it is not impoſſible for them to uſe the Means, which God has appointed. And as my Brother obſerves in the Paſſage cited by you, (1ſt <hi>Vind.</hi> p. 39.) <q>Don't <hi>Calviniſt</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines unitedly agree that God has given common Grace to thoſe to whom he has not given his ſpecial and ſovereign Influences? Is it not univerſally allowed, that by Virtue of this common Grace, they have a Power to abſtain from open Scandal, to perform the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Duties of Religion; to take Pains with their own Hearts to get them in a proper Frame for Duty; and thereby to excite in themſelves, ſome Seriouſneſs, Earneſtneſs, and Diligence; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006483_0018_10290DC2BA4E0298"/>of their own Impotency, and continue to lie at the Foot-ſtool of Divine Grace, for all ſupplies of Grace and Strength for the ſake of Chriſt the Mediator and Redeemer? Is it not univerſally allowed, that if this be their Temper and Conduct, they have ſufficient En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement given them in the Goſpel, to hope that they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſpecial and ſaving Influences of the bleſſed Spirit.</q> And I may here further add, that it is (as far as I know,) univerſally allowed, that the Means (internal and external,) which God is uſing with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, (at leaſt under the Goſpel;) would never fail of being effectual, unleſs they abuſe them. 'Tis true, God did not elect Men to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe he foreſaw, they would in any Meaſure deſerve it before their Converſion. Nor do we think, God has obliged himſelf, by any Promiſe made to unconverted Sinners, that he will convert them, upon the Condition of ſome Endeavours of their own, before Converſion. And it is in Mercy to poor Sinners, that he has not done it. But yet it is manifeſt to me, that when Perſons are truly concerned about their Sin and Danger, and earneſtly ſeeking an Intereſt in the great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they have greater Encouragement given them in the Goſpel, than if God had made ſome certain Promiſes to them; ſuſpended upon the Condition of ſome Doings of their own. But you'll inquire, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your Diſcourſe (p. 21.) <q>Did none of the <hi>Non-Elect,</hi> never do what might be reaſonably expected of Men in their Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?</q> I anſwer; No, never. But you inquire again, <hi>(ibid.)</hi> 
               <q>What if the Non-Elect and done all this, what would have been the Event?</q> I anſwer, abſurd Suppoſitions admit of abſurd Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. If they had not abuſed the Means of Grace, but had done what God might reaſonably expect of them, they would not have been <hi>Non-Elect.</hi> But you ſay, (p. 24.) <q>That we inſiſt upon it, that it is not Men's doing what they can, that is the Terms of Salvation; but their being willing to ſubmit to Chriſt, which they cannot do.</q>— I grant it. But the Means muſt be uſed in order to the End. And although it is morally impoſſible, that we ſhould, without the ſpecial Influences of divine Grace, comply with the Terms of the Goſpel; yet with theſe Aſſiſtances it is by no Means impoſſible. And ſince a divine Bleſſing would accompany the Means, unleſs Men hinder their Efficacy, by their own Sloth, Wickedneſs or Stubbornneſs; ſurely they have no Reaſon to complain; <hi>If our Tranſgreſſions, and our Sins be upon us, and we pine away in them; how ſhall we then live?</hi> Surely ſince this is the Caſe, our natural Impotency to comply with the Terms of the Goſpel, will in no Meaſure, excuſe our Neglect of the great Salvation. And according to our Scheme Men will not (as Mr. <hi>Beach,</hi> and you imagine) have any Thing to plead in the Place of Darkneſs, that their Miſery was not <hi>of themſelves:</hi> That they had no Time of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006483_0019_10290E033A9D9D80"/>Tryal; becauſe the Condition of their Salvation was an impoſſible Condition. And I believe my Brother's Reaſoning is well founded; and exactly agreeable to our Principles in the Paſſage which you cite. (p. 25.) <q>What I will Sinners be perfectly eaſy in their Conſciences in the Regions of eternal Deſpair; when they come to reflect, that Chriſt wrought out a ſufficient Redemption for them; exhibited himſelf, and freely offer'd his ſaving Benefits in the Goſpel to 'em; but they wilfully rejected both him, and them! And when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that God had uſed all proper Means with them for their Salvation; made known their Duty, and the Way of Salvation to them; laid all proper Motives before them, by the Diſcovery of their Need of Salvation, by Threatnings, and Warnings, by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and Invitations, that he might excite both their Hopes and Fears: ſent them his Ambaſſadors to beſeech them to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God; excited them to conſider, and turn to God, by the common Motions of his Holy Spirit, and long exerciſed Patience and Forbearance towards them, in the Uſe of all theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and Means of Grace: And after all, they rejected, abuſed, and ſinned away all theſe Advantages, from no other Neceſſity than the Indulgence of their Luſts, and the Perverſeneſs of their Wills, and finally periſhed, becauſe they <hi>would not come unto Chriſt they might have Life!</hi> Is it poſſible, Conſcience can be perfectly eaſy under theſe Reflections, when awakened by Hell-Fire! ſurely, Sinners will have another View of Things in the Regions of Deſpair, than is pretended by Mr. <hi>Beach</hi> in his Diſcourſe. Their Conſciences will not allow them to argue, as this Gentleman now ſeems to do; that they were excuſable in not improving what Power, and Grace they had, becauſe Chriſt had not purchaſed greater Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, or had not beſtowed the ſame upon them, as upon ſome others.</q> Such a Diſcourſe (you ſay p. 26.) conſidered by it ſelf is affecting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! And all that you are ſorry for, is, that the Doctrine which he and I are defending, intirely undermines ſuch moving Methods of Addreſs. But pray, Sir, what Doctrine? Not our Doctrine of the Decrees as I have proved before: Nor yet our Doctrine of human Impotency; For certainly our not being able to do every Thing, will not excuſe us in doing nothing. And ſince a divine Influence would accompany the Means of Grace, if improved as they ought to be, to enable us <hi>both to will and do,</hi> can we be excuſable if we neglect <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling?</hi> The Huſbandman can't make his Crain ſprout and ſpring up, when it is caſt into the Ground, any more than he can make a new World: but yet this will not excuſe his Negligence, in not breaking up his fallow Ground, and ſowing his Seed.</p>

               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:006483_0020_10290DC7C7165C90"/>
But you ſay,</p>
            <p n="5">V. <q>Our Doctrine intirely overthrows the Notion of Man's being a <hi>free,</hi> or <hi>moral Agent.</hi> You confeſs Indeed (you ſay,) that our Principles admit of what Writers call ſpontaneous or voluntary Freedom; which ſignifies nothing more, than that, when a Man chuſes any Object, or Courſe of Life, this Choice is the Act of the Will. The Mind is willing without any Conſideration, whether he can chuſe any other Object, or Courſe of Life. Thus when a Perſon chuſes to purſue a Life of Virtue, or a Life of Vice, this Choice is the Act of the Will; the Perſon acts voluntarily, in the Matter, although it is utterly impoſſible for him to chuſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Such a voluntary Freedom as this, is all the <hi>Liberty</hi> which our Principles (you ſay) allow to Mankind. But if this be all the Liberty which in Reality they have; the rigid Doctrine of <hi>Fatality</hi> admits of as much. And indeed as much as this, is attributed to Bruits, as well as Men. But it is Liberty of <hi>Choice,</hi> or <hi>Indifference,</hi> that conſtitutes the eſſential and diſtinguiſhing Character of a free, rational, and accountable Creature. And this ſort of Liberty, as the very learned and ingenious Dr. WATTS obſerves, implies a Power to chuſe, or refuſe; to chuſe one Thing, or the contrary, among ſeveral Things that are propoſed, without any inward or outward Reſtraint, Force, or conſtraining Byaſs or Influence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, it appears to me, very abſurd, to ſay, that no rational Being can be a <hi>free</hi> Agent; unleſs he has a Liberty of <hi>Indifference.</hi> GOD himſelf is infinitely free: but can any Chriſtian ſuppoſe, that he has ſuch a Liberty <hi>ad utrumque;</hi> that he can chuſe that which is evil?</p>
            <p>And thus Dr. CLARKE argues, (<hi>Demonſt.</hi> p. 120, 121, 122.) <q>From hence it follows, that though God is a moſt perfectly free Agent; yet he can't but do always that which is beſt, and wiſeſt, in the whole. The Reaſon is evident, becauſe perfect Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, are as ſteddy, and certain Principles of Action; as Neceſſity it ſelf. And an infinitely wiſe, and good Being, endued with the moſt perfect Liberty, can no more chooſe to act in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, than a neceſſary Agent can act contrary to the Neceſſity, by which it is acted. It being as great an Abſurdity, and Impoſſibility in Choice, for infinite Wiſdom, to chooſe to act unwiſely, or infinite Goodneſs, to chooſe what is not good; as it would be in Nature, for abſolute Neceſſity, to fail of producing its neceſſary Effect.</q> — And how can it be imagined, that the bleſſed Angels, and glorified Saints, have a Liberty of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference;
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006483_0021_10290E0513707C78"/>ſo that they can chuſe to be ſeparated from God, and be ſent <hi>into utter Darkneſs, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth for ever?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the Caſe of Mankind, though I freely grant that in many Caſes Men have a Liberty of Indifference; yet in many others, they have not ſuch a Liberty <hi>ad utrumvis.</hi> I have not Dr. WATTS'S Book by me, which you take your Citations from; but I don't doubt, he would allow that in many Caſes, our Choice is determined by the Light of our Minds. However, the Queſtion is not ſo much, what was his Opinion, as what is <hi>Truth?</hi> There are innumerable Inſtances, in which, I find it morally impoſſible for me to chuſe contrary to the Light of my own Mind. I can't make myſelf willing under my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Circumſtances, to be expoſed to the moſt exquiſite Torments, that ever were inflicted by cruel Tyrants. And a Thouſand Inſtances might be given, in which we have not a Liberty of Indifference. Dr. CLARKE, who was no Fataliſt, (unleſs an <hi>Arminian</hi> may be a Fataliſt,) argues in this Caſe, I think, very juſtly. (<hi>Demonſtr.</hi> p. 100.) <q>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity therefore, by which the Power of acting follows the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Underſtanding, is only a moral Neceſſity; that is, no Neceſſity at all in the Senſe, wherein the Oppoſers of Liberty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Neceſſity. For moral Neceſſity is evidently conſiſtent with the moſt perfect natural Liberty. For Inſtance, a Man intirely free from all Pain of Body, and Diſorder of Mind, judges it unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for him to hurt, or deſtroy himſelf; and being under no Temptation, or external Violence, he cannot poſſibly act contrary to his Judgment: not becauſe he wants a natural or phyſical Power, ſo to do; but becauſe it is abſurd, and miſchievous, and morally impoſſible for him to chuſe to do it. Which alſo is the very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the moſt perfect rational Creatures ſuperior to Men, cannot do Evil, not becauſe they want a natural Power to perform the material Action; but becauſe it is morally impoſſible, that with a perfect Knowledge of what is beſt, and without any Temptation to Evil, their Will ſhould determine it ſelf to chuſe to act fooliſhly, and unreaſonably. Here therefore ſeems at laſt to lie the fundamental Error; both of thoſe, who argue againſt the Liberty of the Will, and thoſe who but too confuſedly defend it.</q> And in Matters of Religion, in ſome Caſes, I grant, Men have a Liberty of Indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but in others it is manifeſt they have not. The very Citations which you take from Dr. WATTS, to prove that we have in all Caſes ſuch a Liberty, without being influenced, or byaſſed by the Light of our Minds, do evidently prove the contrary. <q>When the Chriſtian Revelation is propoſed to a Man, as coming from God;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006483_0022_10290DC95B1205F0"/>It becomes Man as a rational Creature, to conſider the Proofs, and Evidences brought to confirm it: The Prophecies, the Miracles, the internal Excellencies, and all external Teſtimonies that come with it. And it is the Will, that muſt employ the Mind, to dwell upon theſe Inquiries, diligently, and faithfully, in proportion to the Merits of the Cauſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If it be neceſſary that we take ſo much Pains, that we may ſee the Evidence of the Truth of the Goſpel, in order to our believing it, then it muſt unavoidably follow, that we can't believe it without ſeeing the Evidences of its Truth, or even contrary to the Conviction of our own Minds. And I May add, if we have ſuch a Liberty of Indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that we can believe the Goſpel, without ſeeing the Evidence of its Truth; and even contrary to the Conviction of our own Minds; then we might believe it, if there were no Evidences of its being true: No Prophecies, no Miracles, no internal Excellencies, and no external Teſtimonies, to incline our Minds to believe the Truth of it. We could (according to your Doctrine;) have believed it, without any Conviction of its being true; and therefore all the Evidences of its Truth are needleſs, to Influence our Belief. And what you cite from my Brother, (p. 31.) appears to me to be to the Purpoſe. <q>Suppoſe a Sinner, while he could <hi>not receive the Things of the Spirit of God;</hi> but they appeared <hi>Fooliſhneſs</hi> to him, while his Affections were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon his Luſts, and Pleaſures, and theſe appeared much the moſt deſirable to him; could determine his Will, to the Choice of thoſe gracious Habits, and Exerciſes, which were his higheſt Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and in which he could ſee nothing deſirable, and eligible; would this render him a moral Agent? Would he be a moral Agent, by chuſing not only, without any ſenſible Motive in View; but even contrary to the Motives he had in View?</q>
            </p>
            <p>But you ſay, (<hi>ibid.</hi>) <q>What is this to the Purpoſe; did ever any Body dream of any ſuch Thing?</q> I anſwer, it is directly to the Purpoſe. And all your Diſcourſe under this Head, is ſounded upon ſuch a Dream. Is not this the very Thing, that you would prove; that a Man is not a free Agent, unleſs he has a Liberty of Indifference; ſo that he can chuſe and refuſe without being influenced by the Light of his Mind? And don't you argue all along, that we join with the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliſts,</hi> becauſe we deny that we can in many Caſes, incline our own Wills <hi>ad utrumque,</hi> to chuſe one Thing, or the contrary?</p>
            <p>But you ſay, it is not to the Purpoſe; (p. 31.) becauſe <q>the <hi>Arminians</hi> unitedly agree, that God has by the glorious Revelation
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006483_0023_10290E0985D7C210"/>of his Spirit, ſet forth in the View of Mankind, the infinite Evil of Sin, and the Divine Amiableneſs of Holineſs; and that he has given to Men a Power of Conſideration; whereby with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly concurring Influences of his Holy Spirit, they can freely examine, and bring home to their Minds, the Truth, Excellency, and Importance of Religion; and the Deceit, Evil, and Bitterneſs of Sin; and upon ſuch a View, they have a Power to embrace the one, and refuſe the other, by the free Choice of their Wills.</q> I anſwer, if this be indeed the Caſe; if it be neceſſary that God by his Spirit, ſhould diſcover to Men the Truth, and Excellency of Religion; and that we muſt examine, and bring home to our Minds this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Truth, Excellency, and Importance of it, in order to our receiving it; then we have not a Liberty of Indifference, to receive, or reject the Goſpel, without being influenced or byaſſed by the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Truth, let into our Minds. And I would further obſerve, if it be <hi>Fataliſm,</hi> to believe that a Man has not a Liberty of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference to believe, and repent, without a glorious Revelation of God's Holy Spirit, to ſet the infinite evil of Sin, and the divine Amiableneſs of Holineſs, in ſuch a Light, at to influence our Choice; then the <hi>Arminians</hi> are as much Fataliſts, as the <hi>Calviniſts;</hi> and all your Conſequences under this Head, follow as much from the Doctrine of one Party, as the other. And all the Queſtion between us upon this Head is; Whether Perſons when they do truly believe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, have not ſome further, and more ſpecial Illuminations of the Spirit: Some more powerful, and ſovereign Influences; than they had before, when they were in a State of Impenitency? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have ſuch a Liberty of Indifference, that they can believe, and repent, without theſe further Illuminations and Aſſiſtances? And that you may be ſatisfied of your Miſtake, I would intreat you to ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider the Texts of Scripture brought by my Brother; to prove the Neceſſity of ſome ſpecial Influences, of the divine Spirit, to convert the Souls of Men; <hi>and make them meet for an Inheritance among the Saints in Light;</hi> more than what are common to all Men in general. And particularly, JOH. vi. 44. <hi>No Man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him.</hi> Mr. BEACH ſays, (2d <hi>Reply</hi> p. 43.) <q>God has drawn Millions, who never were actually drawn ſo as to come to Chriſt. So God drew the whole Body of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation — JER. xxxi. 3. <hi>With Loving-kindneſs have I drawn them.</hi>
               </q> But can you imagine that our Saviour meant nothing more than the drawing of his common Grace, and Providence, when he expreſly tells us, what his meaning was? <hi>Viz.</hi> That no Man could come to him, except the Father draw him in ſuch a manner, as that there would be an actual Fulfilment, of the Prophecies of the Old
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006483_0024_10290DCDC194FBC8"/>Teſtament, ſpoken concerning ſuch as believe in the Meſſiah. As in the next Verſe, <hi>It is written in the Prophets, And they ſhall be all taught of God: every Man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> The Places, in the Prophets, which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our refers to, are ISAI. liv. 13. <hi>And all thy Children ſhall be taught of the Lord; and great ſhall be the Peace of thy Children.</hi> And, JER. xxxi. 34. <hi>For they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt of them, unto the greateſt of them; ſaith the Lord. For I will forgive their Iniquity, and I will remember their Sin no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I had like to have forgot, that it is not ſo much my preſent Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to prove the Truth of our Principles, as to reſcue them, from the bad Conſequences, which you imagine are deducible from them. And thus I have, I think, fairly entered into the Merits of the Cauſe: And whether it does not evidently appear, that every one of theſe Conſequences which you have mentioned; do as much follow from your Principles, as from ours; and moſt of them vaſtly more; I muſt leave it to you, and others to judge.</p>
            <p>Mr. BEACH mentions a great Number of bad Conſequences, which he thinks are deducible from our Principles; but upon looking over them; I can't find any of them, but what have been fairly conſidered under ſome of the foregoing Heads: except a general one, which he mentions (1ſt <hi>Repl.</hi> p. 66.) in theſe Words, <q>I verily believe, this horrible Notion of the ever bleſſed God, propagated by the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtic</hi> Doctrines; is the principal Cauſe of that Malice, and ill Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which appears in many <hi>New-Light</hi> People.</q> But is it from the Abundance of his own good Nature, that he endeavours to load the Memory of my Brother, with perſonal Reproaches, though at the ſame Time, he profeſſes that he believes he is rejoicing in Glory? The Phariſees (who he ſays were <hi>Calviniſts,</hi>) ſhewed more good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than this comes to; for though they perſecuted good Men when they were alive; yet to make them Amends, they built Tombs for them when they were dead. And I believe, I could give ſome ſuch Inſtances of Uncharitableneſs among ſome of the noted <hi>Arminians,</hi> as could hardly be found among any others that profeſs Chriſtianity. <q>DANIEL TILENUS (in the Words of a celebrated Author,) became ſo heated in Favour of <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> that he declared, were he obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to change his Religion, he would turn <hi>Turk,</hi> ſooner than <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt;</hi> for he denyed that the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> believed in God; but owned that the <hi>Truks</hi> did.</q> This was the Man that Mr. BEACH depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon for his Voucher; who, he ſays, was a Friend to the Synod
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006483_0025_10290E0C6C623A78"/>of <hi>Dort.</hi> And other, Inſtances might be found nearer home; but I take no Pleaſure in mentioning theſe Things.</p>
            <p>I muſt now beg leave in my Turn to mention ſome of the bad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, which I think do peculiarly ſlow from ARMINIAN Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. — And</p>
            <p n="1">I. I ſhall conſider ſome of the bad Conſequences that follow from this Principle; that God's <hi>Decrees</hi> do neceſſarily influence every Event; which he has decreed. All your Arguments, or at leaſt the moſt of them, are founded upon this Principle; And all the <hi>Arminian</hi> Writers that I have obſerved, go upon the ſame Principle. And indeed if they did not think, that God's Decrees do influence the decreed Event; more than his Fore knowledge; what Pretence could they have to faſten bad Conſequences upon our Doctrine? But upon this their Principle, they muſt believe the Doctrine of God's neceſſitating De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Reprobation. It is true, we do believe as well as they (and not at all more than they) that God did Decree to ſend the Non-Elect into the World involved in Sin and Miſery, and to leave them to live, and die in Sin; and to puniſh them for their Sins: But then <hi>we</hi> don't believe, that God's Decrees have any Manner of Influence upon us, we are as much at Liberty, and act as freely, as if there were no Decrees at all.</p>
            <p>But <hi>they</hi> think, there is ſome Influence; ſome Efficiency in God's Decrees, to produce the Event. And hence; though they leave the Elect of ſhift for themſelves; yet this Principle conſigns over the Non-Elect to Sin, and Damnation without Remedy. <q>They have no Offer of Chriſt and Salvation; for an Offer upon an Impoſſible Condition is no Offer at all! They have no Time of Tryal.</q> For to what Purpoſe is it for them to try to counteract the Influences of the Decrees of the Almighty? And beſides, does not this Doctrine charge all the Sin, and Wickedneſs of Men, upon the Holy Decrees of the bleſſed God?</p>
            <p>I hope, you'll not think to anſwer this by "Put-offs," as though the <hi>Arminians</hi> don't believe God's Decrees; but only that God has an infallible Fore-knowledge of future Events.—For, I ſuppoſe, there is not an <hi>Arminian</hi> of any Senſe upon Earth; who will deny, that God has decreed to permit Sin. <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelf ſays, (<hi>Exam.</hi> in TWISS. Vind. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. p. 172.) <hi>Quod Deus volens permittit Peccatum, certum eſt.</hi> That it is certain, that God does willingly permit Sin. And in the next Page, you will ſee what he means by the Permiſſion
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006483_0026_10290DCF49D764D8"/>of Sin. <hi>Permiſſio Peccati generatim conſiderati, eſt Suſpenſio Impedimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum omnium, quibus poſitis Peccatum not fieret à Creaturâ.</hi> That it is a Suſpenſion of all thoſe Things, that would otherwiſe hinder the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin. Now if God has decreed to ſuſpend, or with-hold all thoſe Things that would hinder the Commiſſion of Sin, and this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree does neceſſarily influence the Event; how is it poſſible to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Decree of God, from being the Cauſe of Sin? If you ſhould think upon a Review of the Caſe; that Dr. WHITBY, and Mr. BEACH, and you, have gone too far, in aſſerting that God's Decrees do neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily influence the Event, which he has decreed; but yet do ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Opinion, that God's Decrees have ſome kind of Influence, or Efficiency in producing the Event; (more than the Fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God has in producing the Thing fore-known,) how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for you to clear the Decree of God, from being in ſome Meaſure, the Cauſe of the Sin, and Damnation of the Non-Elect?</p>
            <p>If God decreed to ſuſpend, or with-hold all thoſe Things, that would hinder the final Impenitency, and Damnation of the Non-Elect, and this Decree has ſome Kind of Influence upon the Event, then the Decree muſt in ſome Senſe be the Cauſe of it. But indeed there is no Medium in this Caſe; God's Decrees muſt either neceſſarily influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the Event, or not at all, any more than his Fore-knowledge.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> appears to me to be very diſhonourable to God, and hurtful to the Souls of Men. The <hi>Arminians</hi> profeſs, that they believe the intire, and univerſal Depravity of Nature; as much as we do: As I have proved before. But yet they deny, that we derived our corrupt, and ſinful Diſpoſition from <hi>Adam,</hi> as he was our Faederal Head, or Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, in the firſt Covenant. That we were to ſtand, or fall by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Obedience, or Diſobedience as our legal, or Faederal Head, Mr. BEACH ſays (2d <hi>Repl.</hi> p. 54.) is but a <hi>Fable.</hi> But does not this Doctrine, directly charge God with being the Author of Sin? Dr. JOHNSON ſeems in ſome Meaſure to be ſenſible, that this Conſequence is unavoidable. He ſays (Pref. to Mr. <hi>Beach</hi>'s 2d Repl. p. 10.) <q>You aſk, what I aſſign as the true Cauſe of the Creature's moral Imperfection. I anſwer, if by moral Imperfection, you mean (as you muſt) if you ſpeak of the imperfect, or leſs perfect Condition, in which it is made, or born, before it is capable of moral Action; it is no Imputation upon the Almighty, to ſay, he is the Cauſe of it.</q> He owns (p. 9.) that Infants are born with <hi>material Sin;</hi> and yet thinks it is no Imputation upon the Almighty, to ſay that he is the Cauſe of it. If Mr. <hi>Beach</hi> joins with Dr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> in this; I
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006483_0027_10290E0F97631F20"/>don't wonder he ſays (2d <hi>Repl.</hi> p. 26.) <q>that he believes Original Sin, in a more <hi>rigid</hi> Senſe than my Brother did.</q> For it is a more <hi>rigid</hi> Senſe, ſure enough! to charge our Original Corruption, and ſinful Depravity upon the Almighty! — But to go on,</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Univerſal Redemption,</hi> (as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it,) repreſents the Merits of Chriſt's Sufferings, and Death, as being but of little Efficacy, and Value. They deny, that ever Chriſt <hi>purchaſed</hi> Faith, or Holineſs, for any one Perſon Elect, or Non-Elect. So that if Perſons ever arrive to Heaven, it muſt be without Faith, or Holineſs; notwithſtanding any Efficacy, that there is in the Merits of Chriſt. The Scriptures every where repreſent Chriſt's Death, as meritorious not only to procure Pardon, and Life for us; but likewiſe, to purchaſe the Gifts of the divine Spirit to purify our Souls, and qualify us for Glory. And hence the Apoſtle ſays, TIT. 2.14. <hi>He gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify to himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſhould allow that there is any Efficacy in the Blood of Chriſt, to cleanſe us from the Pollution, and Defilement of Sin; it would totally demoliſh their Scheme: becauſe, if Chriſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed Holineſs for any Perſons, it would be neceſſary in the Nature of Things, that they ſhould have it. And therefore they abſolutely deny this. Thus Dr. WHITBY ſays, (upon the five Points, p. 108. 109.) <q>No Sacrifice for Sin; as ſuch, no, not that of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, can ſanctify a Soul, or endow it with that divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that inward Purity, and Likeneſs to God; and all thoſe other chriſtian Virtues, which alone make us capable of the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.—Chriſt therefore by his Death alone, cannot be ſaid to have <hi>procured</hi> that Faith, which purifies the Heart; or that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which renews the Mind, the Will, and Affections; but only to remove that Guilt, which doth obſtruct God's Favour.</q> 
               <hi>He that can receive</hi> ſuch Doctrine, <hi>let him receive it!—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, according to their Doctrine, there was no Efficacy in the Death of Chriſt, to render the Salvation of any one Perſon <hi>certain.</hi> As ſome do refuſe the Benefits of redeeming Mercy; ſo all might do it, and his Death might have been wholly in vain; notwithſtanding any Intention, that Chriſt had to ſave any one Perſon: or notwithſtanding any Efficacy in his Merits. When Chriſt made his Soul an Offering for Sin, he could not have this Comfort, and Satisfaction, ariſing from any Efficacy in his Sufferings, (according to this Doctrine;) <hi>to ſee his Seed, and the Travel of his Soul, to juſtify many;</hi> becauſe it was uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:006483_0028_10290DD2237A8118"/>notwithſtanding his Agonies, and Death, whether any would be juſtified.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Your Doctrine, that all Men have <hi>ſufficient Grace</hi> for Salvation: contains a Swarm of bad Conſequences. You ſay (p. 31, 32.) <q>Don't the <hi>Arminians</hi> unitedly agree, that God has by the glorious Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of his Spirit, ſet forth in the View of Mankind, the infinite Evil of Sin, and the divine Amiableneſs of Holineſs; and that he has given to Man, a Power of Conſideration, whereby with the conſtantly concurring Influences of his Holy Spirit, they can freely examine and bring home to their Minds, the Truth, Excellency, and Importance of Religion; and the Deceit, Evil, and Bitterneſs of Sin; and that on ſuch a View of Things, they have a Power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the one, and embrace the other, by the free Choice of their Wills?" And in (p. 43.) You ſay, "It is (according to <hi>Arminans,</hi>) intirely in your Power, through the conſtant Concurrence, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of divine Grace, to chuſe and obtain eternal Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. According to this Doctrine, GOD is not to be acknowledged, as the <hi>Author</hi> of all that is ſpiritually Good in us. According to the ſcripture Account, it is <hi>God that works in us both to Will and to Do. He works all the good Pleaſure of his Grace in us, and even the Work of Faith with Power.</hi> Hence the Apoſtle prayed for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that <hi>they might know what is the exceeding Greatneſs of his Power, to us-ward who believe according to the working of his mighty Power.</hi> Eph. i. 18, 19. But according to your Doctrine, good Men have no other Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Spirit of God, than what are common to all Men. Every Man has ſuch conſtant Aſſiſtances of the Holy Spirit, that he has it intirely in his own Power to believe, and repent; and no other Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances are neceſſary. So that if there be any good in us, more than in ſome others, we ourſelves are the Cauſe of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Your Doctrine, has a direct Tendency to lead Men into a wrong Notion, concerning that great Change, which the Scriptures call <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,</hi> or <hi>Converſion.</hi> A ſaving Converſion to God, is a great, and a mighty Change; ſo that when we do experience it, <hi>we are cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated anew in Chriſt Jeſus to good Works, and become new Creatures,</hi> in all ſpiritual Reſpects. And thoſe Perſons, who have not thus <hi>paſſed from Death, to Life;</hi> but live and die in an unregenerate State; they will find themſelves awfully diſappointed, notwithſtanding all their Self-flattery, and deluding Hopes, when they come to appear, before the Bar of impartial Juſtice. And alas! How apt are Perſons to delude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with falſe Hopes! How prone to imagine, that they are in a
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:006483_0029_10290E145B311AF8"/>ſtate of Grace, and Favour with God, when they have not ſo much as the Seeds of true Holineſs! <q>Fight not (ſays Mr. BAXTER) with ſmall, or great, but againſt the falſe Hopes of chriſtian Profeſſors.</q> And what a ſad Tendency has your Doctrine, to make People eaſy, and <hi>ſettle them upon their Lecs?</hi> They are told, <hi>that as they have Grace ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for Salvation, they have it intirely in their Power,</hi> to comply with the Goſpel; and therefore they think but little of the Importance, of laying a good Foundation in a ſaving Converſion to God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Doctrine, tends to keep poor Sinners in a ſtate of carnal <hi>Security,</hi> without any concern about their Salvation. A ſenſe of our own Impotency, and periſhing State, unleſs God in his infinite Mercy <hi>will caſt his Skirt over us, and ſay unto us, Live;</hi> is almoſt the only Thing, that excites a Concern in the Souls of Sinners, about eternal Things. When a Perſon is fallen into the Water, ſo long as he thinks it is in his own Power to help himſelf, he is eaſy enough; but when he finds he muſt unavoidably periſh, unleſs he can obtain ſome Help, this Reflection, will make him concerned,: ſo in the preſent Caſe, if Perſons had but a ſuitable ſenſe, of the miſerable State that they are in, whilſt under the Dominion of Sin, and their utter Inability, to help themſelves; and that <hi>if God does ariſe and ſave them,</hi> it muſt be owing to nothing, but his meer <hi>Mercy;</hi> they would not be ſo little concerned, about the Means of obtaining the divine Favour. You ſay, <q>Some think that all unconverted Men are <hi>Arminians!</hi>
               </q> And indeed I think, all ſecure Sinners, are in this Reſpect too much tinged with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſm;</hi> They have too much Self-Confidence, which is the grand Cauſe of their carnal Security. But,</p>
            <p n="4">4. If unconverted Sinners are under ſome Concern about their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; this Doctrine if received, would effectually <hi>ſtifle</hi> the <hi>Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of their Conſciences; and incline them, to <hi>put off</hi> their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion until a further Opportunity. As men imagine, that their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is a Thing that is within the Compaſs of their own Power; they think, it will be time enough afterwards. There are but few that are ſo hardened in their Wickedneſs, as to have no thoughts of Death, and Eternity. And the moſt abandoned Sinner, however he may <hi>ſay to God, Depart from me,</hi> and will even venture, to meet God in his loudeſt Thunder; yet at Times he ſays in his Heart, <hi>Let me die the Death of the Righteous, and let laſt End be like his:</hi> But then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon a future Repentance and drives away the Convictions of his own Conſcience, with a <hi>Go thy Way for this Time.</hi>—He feels himſelf in Health, he thinks he has a Proſpect of living many Years; and he had learned from your Doctrine; that he has a Liberty of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:006483_0030_10290DD3ABE872B0"/>and a Power to believe, and repent, when he pleaſes. And if he could but convince himſelf of one Thing further, that though he does all his Life time mock God, <hi>and trample under Foot, the Blood of the Convenant as an unholy Thing;</hi> yet the Prieſt can abſolve him, when he comes to lie upon a Death Bed; and then he may die in Peace: I ſay, if he is convinced of theſe Things; it is no Wonder, if he does think it will be time enough to repent, when Old Age has cooled the Heat of his Luſts; or when he muſt part with his ſinful Pleaſures, at the Approaches of Death.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Your Doctrine, (if received,) will effectually prevent the <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi> of a Sinner. God rejecteth the Proud, but giveth Grace to the humble. There is hardly any one Thing that unfits the Souls of Men to receive Chriſt by Faith ſo much as a Principle of Self-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency. A Belief that they are Something, when they are Nothing. An Imagination that they have ſomething that is Good, and pleaſing to God; though they <hi>are Unbelivers, and their very Minds and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are defiled.</hi> How can Men ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be <hi>All, and in all,</hi> when they have ſomething elſe to rely upon? Among Men every Body can ſee, that a Malefactor convicted of a Capital Offence, againſt a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sovereign, can't take beter Courſe, than a Noble man did of late, acknowledge his Offence, with its aggravating Circumſtances, and caſt himſelf intirely upon the Mercy of his Sovereign. And if poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners would, from a real ſenſe of their Sin, and Miſery, caſt themſelves wholly upon the Mercy of God in Chriſt; humbly waiting at <hi>the Mercy-ſeat,</hi> in the diligent Uſe of the Means that God has appointed, this is the Way to <hi>obtain Mercy and find Grace to help in time of need.</hi> But your Doctrine, teaches poor Sinners that they have ſufficient Grace already, if they do but improve it, (let them be ever ſo graceleſs;) and it is intirely in their own Power, to ſecure their Salvation; what need is there then that they ſhould be loſt in themſelves, that <hi>they may be found in Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Your Principles tend to make Men think, that the Doctrine of our <hi>Union</hi> to CHRIST is needleſs. The Scriptures aſſure us that there is a ſpiritual Union between Chriſt and Believers, as <hi>he is the Head of the Body which is the Church; and they Members of the ſame Body.</hi> Faith is the Band of Union between Chriſt and Believers. And hence <hi>Chriſt is ſaid to dwell in our Hearts by Faith.</hi> And ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, are in Chriſt. <hi>If any Man be in Chriſt, he is a new Creature.</hi>— This Union is the Foundation of our Juſtification, Adoption, and Sanctification, (in the Beginnings, and progreſtive Growth of it;) as well as of eternal Glory. Our Saviour ſays, <hi>Without me (or out of me)
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:006483_0031_10290E16006BBE08"/>ye can do nothing.</hi> But what need is there of ſuch a ſpiritual Union with Chriſt, if all Men have a Liberty of Indifference, to bend their own Wills, to that which is Good; and have it intirely in their own Power, to ſecure their Salvation, though they have no ſuch ſpecial Relation to him? Thus your Doctrine leaves us without any Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for a chriſtian Hope: <hi>For Chriſt is in us the Hope of Glory, if we have fled for Reluge, to lay hold on the Hope that is ſet before us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Your Doctrine, tends to ſap the Foundation of a Life of holy <hi>Obedience.</hi> All external Obedience, if it don't ſpring from a new, and vital Principle of Grace, and Holineſs, is but meer Hypocriſy. And therefore Perſons that are truly converted to God, are ſaid, to have <hi>new Hearts.</hi> — <hi>Their Hearts are circumciſed to love, and fear God.</hi> And <hi>God's Law is written upon their Hearts.</hi> They act from a new Principle of ſupreme Love to God, and Faith in a Redeemer. And hence their Obedience flows in an unconſtrained Manner, as Waters from a Fountain; Our Saviour compares it, <hi>to a Well of living Water ſpringing up to everlasting Life.</hi> But according to your Doctrine, there is no need of ſuch a new Principle of Action: for every Man has it in his Power, to incline his Heart, to a true and unfeigned Obedience to God's Commandments; and <hi>his Commandments will not be grievous unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Your Principles (if really received,)would prevent a Life of <hi>Faith,</hi> and Dependance upon Chriſt. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>our Life.</hi> And <hi>the Life</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle,) <hi>that I now live in the Fleſh, I live by the Faith, of the Son of God</hi> The Believer has his Dependance upon Chriſt, not only for Pardon, and Juſtification; but for continual ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of Grace; <hi>that of his Fulneſs he may receive, even Grace, for Grace.</hi> He is ſenſible of his own Emptineſs and of Chriſt's Fulneſs. He knows, that he has no Sufficiency of himſelf; but that all his Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency is of Chriſt. And he always finds by Experience, that when he has the greateſt ſenſe of his own Weakneſs; then he is ſtrongeſt; <hi>for he can do all Things through Chriſt ſtrengthening him.</hi> But by your Doctrine, Men are taken off from Chriſt, to depend upon themſelves. They have a Liberty of Indifference, and a ſufficient Power to hate Sin, and love Holineſs, and this is interwove in their Natures, as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Agents; What need then have they of freſh ſupplies of Grace from Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Your Doctrine, tends to hinder Men from uſing any Endeavours, to obtain any ſpecial, or ſenſible <hi>Communion</hi> with GOD. Our Minds are naturally exceeding dark, and blind, with Reſpect to any realizing
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:006483_0032_10290DD538D145D8"/>View, or Apprehenſion, that we have of the glorious Perfections of God. Men ben't ſenſible of the Darkneſs and Blindneſs of their own Minds, until they have been in ſome Meaſure, divinely illuminated. I have often thought, that our Caſe may very well be compared, to that of a Man tha is born, and brought up in a dark Dungeon. He knows no Difference between Darkneſs, and Light, until he ſees ſome Gleams of Light, ſhine through a Chink; which for the preſent raviſh his Heart; but when theſe are intercepted, he ſits and bemoans him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in his dark, and uncomfortable State. God is pleaſed to enlighten the Minds of good Men; eſpecially at ſome Seaſons, and give them an inward Apprehenſion of his glorious Perfections, in ſuch a Manners, as to draw forth their whole Souls after him, as their Portion, and only Happineſs: ſo that <hi>the Love of God is ſhed abroad in their Hearts,</hi> and they can <hi>rejoice in God, with Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>Lord, lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon us.</hi> And our Saviour ſays, <hi>He will manifeſt himſelf</hi> to true Believers.— But according to your Doctrine, there are no ſuch ſpecial <hi>Sealings of the Spirit.</hi> Every Man can know enough of God, by the conſtantly concurring Influences of his Spirit, and Grace, ſo that he has it intirely in his own Power, to love God ſupremely, and delight in him.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Your Principles are directly Oppoſite to true <hi>Thankfulneſs.</hi> When a Chriſtian has a View of his own Vileneſs, and Unworthineſs, ſo that he appears loathſome to himſelf; and yet at the ſame Time, has a Senſe of the Riches of God's Grace, <hi>in plucking him as a Brand out of the Fire,</hi> this will excite true Thankfulneſs. He knows, that he was no better by Nature than other Men, and he has ſuch a Senſe of the Aggravations of his own Sins, which he committed againſt God; that he looks upon himſelf to be <hi>leſs than the leaſt of all God's Mercies.</hi> He can ſay therefore as the Apoſtle, <hi>It is by the Grace of God that I am what I am.</hi> He wonders at, and admires, the Riches of God's Grace; in bringing him <hi>out of the horrible Pit, and miry Clay,</hi> when he might have been left, as well as many others, <hi>to treaſure up to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath.</hi> The Language of his Heart therefore is; <hi>What ſhall I render to the Lord for all his Benefits? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thy loving-kindneſs is better than Life; my Lips ſhall praiſe thee.</hi> And he deſires above all Things, that he may be more, and more, conformed to God; and that he may be more, and more, devoted to his Service. But according to your Principles, he is miſtaken, after all: God has not diſtinguiſhed him, from any others, by any ſpecial Influences of his Grace; and therefore it is owing to himſelf, and not to God, that he is in a State of Grace, and going to Heaven, while many others are going to Deſtruction; and he may thank him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for it.</p>
            <p n="11">

11. Your Doctrine, renders the great Duty of <hi>Prayer,</hi> eſpecially for ſpiritual <hi>Aſſiſtances,</hi> of little or no Importance. Let a Man be converted, or unconverted; what Influences of the Holy Spirit muſt he pray for? If he be wicked, and ungodly, what divine Influences can he aſk for, more than he has already received? He can (it is true,) upon your Principles expreſs his Thankfulneſs, (ſuch as it is,) to God, that he has made him a moral Agent; and endowed him with ſuch Faculties; that he has a Liberty of Indifference, to chuſe that which is well pleaſing in his Sight; and has granted to him "the glorious Revelation of his Spirit, to diſcover to him the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Evil of Sin, and the divine Amiableneſs of Holineſs:" And though he loves Sin and <hi>rowls it under his Tongue as a ſweet Morſel,</hi> but ſees no Beauty in Holineſs, and has not only the ſtrongeſt Averſion to it, but looks upon the Goſpel as a Deluſion, and upon all thoſe who make any ſerious Profeſſion of it with Scorn, as a Pack of whining Hypocrites or over heated Enthuſiaſts, yet he has it in his own Power to love, and delight in it, when he pleaſes. What now has he to aſk for more? Muſt he pray, that God would open his Eyes by the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating Influences of his Spirit, to diſcover to him the odious Nature of Sin, the Amiableneſs of Holineſs, and the divine Glory, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs of a crucified Saviour? No; this would be as Mr. BEACH expreſſes it, "to gape for <hi>New-Light."</hi> Muſt he pray, that God would bow his ſtubborn, and rebellious Will, and incline his hard, and impenitent Heart, to a willing Obedience, to the Goſpel of his dear Son? No: This would "deſtroy his <hi>moral Agency."</hi> What then! Muſt he pray, that God would deliver him from the reigning Power, and Pollution of Sin, by the purifying, and cleanſing Efficacy of Chriſt's Blood? No; "Chriſt never died to procure <hi>Sanctification</hi> for any Man; he died only to obtain <hi>Pardon."</hi> Well, if he died to obtain Pardon, man't he pray that God would pardon and juſtify him, by the Imputation of CHRIST'S <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> as he died our <hi>Surety</hi> and is <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſs?</hi> No: for "<hi>Chriſt's</hi> Righteouſneſs is <hi>infinite,</hi> and therefore can't be applied to a <hi>finite</hi> Creature." In a word then, may he pray, that God would give him a new, abiding Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Faith, and Holineſs, whereby he may without fail, perſevere unto eternal Life? No: for then he muſt "turn <hi>Calviniſt:"</hi> And he had as good be what he is; as to "worſhip <hi>Fate,</hi> under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>God."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And upon your Principles, what ſpiritual Bleſſings can we pray for in the Behalf of <hi>others?</hi> When Miniſters Pray, that God would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert their wicked People; what do they hope that God will do for them more than he has done? Or when Parents pray for the Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006483_0034_10290DD9A7D89B78"/>and Converſion of their wicked Children, what can they mean by it? According to your Principles, they have <hi>Grace ſufficient</hi> already, if they would but improve it: And if God ſhould influence their Wills, and incline their Hearts by the inſuperable Efficacy of his Grace, what would become of their <hi>free Agency?</hi>—But once more, and to omit many other Things,</p>
            <p n="12">12. Your Doctrine tends to <hi>depreciate</hi> the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the <hi>Means of Grace.</hi> The Goſpel is "The Power of God unto Salvation, to every one that believeth." And the Means of Grace are divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and do never ſail of producing their ſalutary Effects, from any Ineſticacy in them, as ſuch; but from their being abuſed.</p>
            <p>And every ſenſible Chriſtian, muſt needs prize and value the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and Means of Grace, as they are appointed by God, and effectual by his Bleſſing, to promote their Salvation. But inſtead of depending upon the Bleſſing of God, in the Uſe of theſe Means; your Doctrine, teaches Men to depend upon their own Power, and their own Wills; which muſt from the very Nature of their free Agency; have a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Indifference, to Good, and Evil; whether they have or have not, the Means of Grace.—But to return,</p>
            <p n="5">V. Your <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrine, that we are not <hi>juſtified</hi> by the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of CHRIST, <hi>imputed</hi> to us; and received by <hi>Faith;</hi> is of very dangerous Conſequence.</p>
            <p>For,</p>
            <p n="1">I. It tends to <hi>depreciate,</hi> or <hi>undervalue</hi> the meritorious Sufficiency of Chriſt's <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> There is an infinite Value and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in the Merits of Chriſt: And therefore <hi>he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to him.</hi> What your particular Opinion in this Caſe, is, I can't ſay; but Mr. BEACH, whoſe Principles you have undertaken to defend, has freely expreſſed his Sentiments upon this Head. Having mentioned my <hi>Brother's</hi> Opinion, that <hi>Adam</hi> was our faederal Head, by whoſe Obedience, or Diſobedience, we were to ſtand, or fall, according to the Tenor of the firſt Covenant: He ſays, (2d <hi>Reply,</hi> p. 54.) <q>This I did then, and do ſtill call a <hi>Fable.</hi> It has not only no Foundation in the Word of God; but is there plainly contradicted.—Beſides, it is in many Reſpects, a moſt abſurd Scheme. To name but one. This Hypotheſis makes <hi>Adam's</hi> Righteouſneſs, infinitely more valuable, and efficacious than that of <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Lord from Heaven. For according to Mr. <hi>Dickinſon,</hi> if <hi>Adam</hi> had kept but one Precept, and that for a ſhort Time, that Obedience would have been of ſuch infinite Virtue; as to ſecure
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:006483_0035_10290E1AAD608420"/>eternal Happineſs to himſelf, and to every ſingle Child of his for ever: Whereas Chriſt's moſt holy Life, and dreadful Death, could ſave but a Part of Mankind.</q> Mr. BEACH could not mean accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my <hi>Brother's</hi> Opinion, with Reſpect to the Extent of Chriſt's Redemption; for he ſays (p. 38.) <q>Mr. DICKINSON contradicts them, (<hi>i. e.</hi> other <hi>Calviniſts,</hi>) and joins with me, in aſſerting that he died for every individual of the human Race. What I would obſerve is, that he aſſerts that Chriſt wrought out a ſufficient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for all Mankind.—I never taught univerſal Redemption in any other Senſe, or in ſtronger Terms.</q> And beſides Mr. BEACH confines his Meaning, to my Brother's Opinion, concerning the Effect of <hi>Adam's</hi> Obedience; and the Advantage that would have accrued from it, to his Poſterity: And accordingly aſſerts, if all Mankind would have been in a confirmed State of Happineſs, by <hi>Adam's</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; then his Righteouſneſs would have been infinitely more ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, than the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; <q>for Chriſt's moſt holy Life, and dreadful Death, could ſave but a Part of Mankind.</q> So that according to him, Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is ſo infinitely defective, that it can ſave but a Part of Mankind! Is this, Sir, agreeable to the Scripture-Doctrine, that there is ſuch an infinite Sufficiency, in Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, that the greateſt Sinner may flee to him for Shelter, from impending Wrath? But</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Doctrine, teaches Men to <hi>truſt,</hi> at leaſt in Part, to <hi>their own</hi> Obedience, for their Juſtification before God. And hence they are in infinite Danger, of <hi>not attaining to the Law of Righteouſneſs, becauſe they ſeek it not by Faith, but as it were by the Works of the Law.</hi> 
               <q>Men may think they do Honour enough, to the great Redeemer, whilſt they acknowledge him, to be the meritorious Cauſe of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</q> though at the ſame Time they truſt to their religious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, imagining that they have ſome real Worth, or Value, (not to ſay Merit,) in them, to procure their Juſtification. But alas! our beſt Duties are but as <hi>filthy Rags,</hi> there is ſo much Sin mixed with them, that our very Tears have need of Waſhing in the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Your <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrine, that true Saints may <hi>totally</hi> and <hi>finally fall from Grace,</hi> gives Men a wrong Notion of the Covenant of Grace, and of the Mediator of it. The Word of God aſſures us, that thoſe <hi>whom God loves, he loves to the End.</hi> That <hi>they who are juſtified, ſhall he glorified.</hi> That true Believers, <hi>will be kept by the Power of God, through Faith unto Salvation.</hi> That <hi>when Men are born of God, their Seed remains in them;</hi> and therefore they cannot Sin unto Death. <hi>And
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:006483_0036_10290DDFB466C3B0"/>that they who do ſin,</hi> (i. e. live in Sin,) <hi>have not ſeem Jeſus Chriſt, neither have they known him.</hi> And therefore it follows, that they who do ſee, and know Jeſus Chriſt, will never be in ſuch a State of Sin. But according to your <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrine, a Perſon may be a good Man to Day; and in the Love, and Favour of God; but to morrow he may die, and go to Hell. But this Principle ſuppoſes, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, is as precarious as the Covenant of Works, and Chriſt the Mediator of it, as mutable as <hi>Adam.</hi> According to the Tenor of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>God will write his Laws in the Hearts of his People, and he will be unto them a God, and they ſhall be unto him a People.</hi> And hence, <hi>this Covenant is well ordered in all Things and ſure.</hi> And as Chriſt is an unchangeable Mediator; ſo <hi>the Promiſes are in him all Yea, and Amen.</hi> And hence, true Believers have the greateſt Aſſurance, of the future Enjoyment of that great Good, which is promiſed: ſince <hi>they know him, whom they have truſted, and that he will keep that which is committed to him.</hi>—God is willing in the Covenant of Grace, <hi>more abundantly to ſhew unto the Heirs of Promiſe the Immutability of his Counſel, and accordingly, has confirmed it with an Oath: That by two immutable Things, in which it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for God to lie; we might have a ſtrong Conſolation who have fled for Refuge, to lay hold on the Hope ſet before us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, Sir. I have conſidered ſome of the Conſequences, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me to be deducible from your Principles, taken ſeparately; I might mention others that flow from them taken together; but as I have already exceeded the Bounds of my intended Brevity, I ſhall mention but one; and that is, that your Principles tend to make Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons believe, that it is vaſtly <hi>eaſier</hi> to obtain eternal Happineſs, than the Scriptures repreſent the Caſe. And hence, how naturally do Men content themſelves with a meer <hi>Form of Godlineſs; while they deny the Power of it?</hi> Our Saviour (<hi>who knews what is in Man</hi>) ſays, Luke xiii. 24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate; for many, I ſay unto you, ſhall ſeek to enter and ſhall not be able. And</hi> Matth. vii. 13, 14. <hi>Enter ye in at the ſtrait Gate;—Becauſe ſtrait is the Gate, and narrow is the Way, that leadeth unto life; and few there be that find it.</hi> But you ſay (P. 43.) <q>It is (according to the <hi>Arminians,</hi>) intirely in your Power, through the conſtant Concurrence, and Influence of divine Grace, to chuſe, and obtain eternal Life.</q> If you have it intirely in your own Power to obtain eternal Life; what need is there, <hi>that you ſhould work out your Salvation with Fear and Trembling?</hi> I muſt acknowledge, your Doctrine that God's Decrees do neceſſarily influence the Event; does eternally block up the Way againſt the Non Elect; otherwiſe all Men might obtain eternal Life with all
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:006483_0037_10290DE2A327AA10"/>imaginable Eaſe. And therefore it is no Wonder, if Men who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace theſe Principles, ſay, <hi>We ſhall have Peace, though we walk in the Imagination of our own Hearts, to add Drunkenneſs to Thirſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Conſequences which I have mentioned, do naturally follow (as I firmly believe,) from your <hi>Arminian</hi> Principles. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if the People who embrace theſe Principles, don't appear generally, to be leſs concerned about their Salvation than other Men, I muſt confeſs, I ſhall have Reaſon to queſtion; whether I am not miſtaken. For the Effect, will bear ſome Proportion to the Cauſe, by which it is influenced. You ſay, (p. 8.) <q>That you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified to hold the Ballance, to weigh the actual Effects of the reſpective Doctrines.</q> But Mr. BEACH ſeems to be more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous, and to freely own, that the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> do for the preſent live better Lives than the <hi>Arminians.</hi> His Words are (2d <hi>Reply</hi> p. 78.) <q>And if any of you are wicked, <hi>(as I hope not,)</hi> yet this is not ſo much the Fault of the Man, as his Principles; whereas if we are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, <hi>(as it is too true,)</hi> it is the Man, and not his Principles, that is to be blamed.</q> His meaning muſt be, that the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> are either better by Nature, or have better Advantages to be religious, than the <hi>Arminians;</hi> and that it is this, and not their Principles, that makes the Difference in their Lives. I grant, ſome Allowance ought to be made, upon the Account of the ſuperior Advantages, which the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> generally have, more than the <hi>Arminians:</hi> But it is manifeſt, this is not the only Thing, that makes the Difference, for there are ſome Arminians that enjoy the ſame Advantages with others; and yet are vicious.</p>
            <p>But he intimates that the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> were not always the moſt reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; <q>The <hi>Phariſees</hi> (he ſays, <hi>ibid.</hi>) were rigid <hi>Proedeſtinarians,</hi> or <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> as they are now called.</q> And to prove this, why could he not ſay as Mr. <hi>Dodwell?</hi> 
               <q>St. <hi>Paul</hi> being bred a Phariſee, ſpake and is to be interpreted, <hi>ex mente Phariſaeorum,</hi> according to the Doctrine of the Phariſees.</q> But be it ſo, that the Phariſees held the Doctrine of Predeſtination to eternal Life. Then it will follow, that this was the Doctrine of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church. For they were not only, the moſt ſtrict in their Morals; but the moſt orthodox in their Principles, of any Part of the Jewiſh Church. There were a great many of them Hypocrites, it is true; and they held one grand Error; <hi>for being ignorant of the Righteouſneſs of God, they went about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs:</hi> and in this Reſpect they were <hi>Arminians.</hi> And their Hypocriſy, and Wickedneſs, was chiefly owing to this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; and not to their believing the Doctrine of Predeſtination, any more than their believing the Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:006483_0038_10290DE4432027D8"/>
But Mr. BEACH brings one Inſtance more, (p. 79.) <q>Look back (ſays he,) upon the State of our Nation, juſt one hundred Years paſt, in the Time of the grand Rebellion, never did theſe Principles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail ſo much-before, nor ſince, and never, was there ſo much Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in the Nation.</q> The grand Rebellion! I acknowledge the Propriety of the Expreſſion.</p>
            <p>For to rebel againſt the Sovereign Authority of the Law, and ſet up the lawleſs Will of a miſguided Prince as the Standard of Government; is as grand a Rebellion as can be againſt any earthly Authority. But Mr. BEACH is miſtaken, when he thinks that our Principles prevailed chiefly in the Time of that grand Rebellion: For Archbiſhop LAUD, (who was no ſmall Inſtrument in that Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,) and a number of the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> did openly profeſs the <hi>Arminian</hi> Principles at that Time; which they would not dare to have done ſome Time before. Dr. JOHNSON (Pref. p. 11.) owns, that <hi>Calviniſm</hi> prevailed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from within the <hi>Marian</hi> Perſecution, to the Reſtoration; i. e. until about 100 Years after the Reformation. So that it was theſe Principles, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and ſupported the holy <hi>Martyrs,</hi> when they were called to paſs through the fiery Tryal, when <hi>they could rejoice with Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory.</hi> And Mr. BEACH is likewiſe miſtaken, when he thinks, that there was more <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> in the Nation before the Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than there has been ſince: for it is manifeſt, that the People in general were much more ſober, and ſerious at that Time, than after the Reſtoration; when a Flood of open Wickedneſs covered the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Dregs of which, have not been purged off until this Day.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I have finiſhed the Taſk, which you have aſſigned me. And may the God of Truth, lead us into all Truth.</p>
