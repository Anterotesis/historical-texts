            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Author of the following Pages has no View of impoſing his Notions on any Perſon; but as far as they appear to be reaſonable, any Man is welcome to them. As to his Method, or Diction, his Aim was only to write ſo as to be read, and to expreſs himſelf ſo as to be underſtood; and he had a greater Ambition to make it appear, that he was a ſincere Lover of the Country, than that he was a fine O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator. He hopes that the Reader will not depart from Truth, to differ with him, and he expects no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice no further than it ſhall appear to be ſo: But if there ſhould be ſuch an Animal, as a peeviſh <hi>Critick</hi> in this Climate, he wiſhes him a good Stomach, and he doubts not but according to it's Bigneſs he will have a plentiful Feaſt.</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY ON CURRENCY.</head>
            <p>THAT the unſettled State of the Currency has been the Occaſion of great Inconveniency to this Province, and was once within View of its Ruine, I believe there are but few disinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted Men that will deny: And I conceive the Paper-Money at this time is very far from being on ſo good an Eſtabliſhment as it might be, and that ſome Perſons are ſo far from wanting it to be put on a better Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they had rather it were all deſtroy'd. I ſhall therefore endeavour to ſhew, that there is a Neceſſity for ſome Currency, and that that Currency, by the Nature of our Trade, cannot be Silver or Gold: That Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Money will anſwer all the Ends, that any other Money will, for a Medium of Trade. And then I ſhall propoſe a Method for eſtabliſhing it on a firm and laſting Foundation; and examine the Conſequences thereof to this Province, and the Effects it may have on the Trade of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:040043_0004_1015CE478C452CA0"/>If any ſhould ſay that we have no neceſſity for Currency at all, but that our Trade may as well be carried on by <hi>Barter</hi>: To him I anſwer. He that has well conſidered the Inconveniencies that attend that Method, I am of Opinion, will not be fond of it long.</p>
            <p>By Barter you can neither ſell, nor buy, but once a Year, except from the Stores, that are up and down the Country, and you muſt be at their Mercy, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the prices of their Goods, but of your own too: And they will generally get more by ſending them from the Ship to the Store, than the Merchant in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> gets by tranſporting them from <hi>England</hi> hither.</p>
            <p>Beſides we have ſeveral Inſtances, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Stores have left many Families, which had ſeveral Negroes, without ſcarce a Negro to help them. And I believe had it not been for an extraordinary Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, it had been much worſe.</p>
            <p>Again, a <hi>Barter-Trade</hi> doth, I conceive, tend to the Ruine of all the Towns in the <hi>Province</hi>; and the People will live ſcatter'd about; only with a few Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-Houſes amongſt them, to the great Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of foreign Trade, and the great perplexity and Inconveniency of the Trader.</p>
            <p>And farther, Trading by Barter doth tend to lodge the greateſt part of the Riches of a Province in a few Hands, and the Conſequences of that will be, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the poorer ſort very baſe and mean, ſo that, to uſe My Lord <hi>Bacon's</hi> Words, the one fiftieth Man of them, will not be fit for a Helmet: And I think it much concerns the Intereſt of this <hi>Province,</hi> to keep up the Spirits of the lower ſort of People, for we have much reaſon to expect great Uſe of them e're long, both from thoſe among us, and thoſe behind us.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:040043_0005_1015CE4D4E4C6A68"/>If you have a Barter-Trade, a Man cannot hire a poor Man, and pay him his Wages when he has done his Work, but he muſt go to the Stores, and take per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps what he doth not want; and the Store-Keeper will get ſo much out of his Wages as will almoſt ſtarve him.</p>
            <p>And I am apt to think every Man, tho' he had no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical or Religious Views, ſhould think it the Intereſt of his Family, to have proviſion made, to keep the poorer ſort of them from Oppreſſion to Poſterity: For we have many Inſtances amongſt us, of thoſe whoſe Fathers in the laſt Age were rich enough, altho' they have little or nothing now. And no Man knows, (ſuch is the Viciſſitude of Human Affairs) what his Family may come too. If his Family be very great, it is probable ſome of them will e're long be of the poorer ſort, and the providing for them (and with them the Poor, in general,) is the moſt Beneficent Thing a Man can do. The Rich, he need not doubt, will know well enough how to provide for themſelves. Then on the other ſide, Men of over-grown-Eſtates, none ought to be fond of, no not even among Princes: For if great Parts, great Ambition and great Valour ſhould happen to meet in the ſame Perſon, the World has had Inſtances enough, what they are then to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. So that I take it to be the Intereſt of <hi>America,</hi> and, I apprehend alſo, the Policy of <hi>England,</hi> to keep the Wealth of <hi>America,</hi> as near as can be, on a Par, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subjects.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould ſay, Theſe are Conſequences that cannot affect this Age: Perhaps they may not; but great Alterations in States are generally the Effects of the Councils of preceeding Ages, and wiſe Governments
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:040043_0006_1015CE4FD63E7D10"/>always conſider what Effect their Tranſactions may have on Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, that by the Nature of our Trade, this <hi>Currency</hi> cannot be <hi>Silver</hi> or <hi>Gold.</hi> For ſuppoſing we now had a ſufficient Quantity of Gold and Silver for a <hi>Medium of Trade,</hi> our Trade is ſuch, that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Ships always do or can bring in more in Value of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Commodities, than their Ships will carry back in our Produce. Now this Overplus, or the Ballance of the Account, the Trader, when his Ship is loaded with our Produce, will carry away in our Money, this would ſoon drain us of all our Money, unleſs we had Mines, or ſome Trade, the Returns whereof, in Silver, would be anſwerable to the Ballance of our Trade with <hi>England,</hi> which we have not.</p>
            <p>There is another Reaſon, why Silver will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main here long, which is, that the Trader will always carry away our Money, inſtead of our Produce, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Money will anſwer his Ends better in <hi>Europe,</hi> and leave our Produce to periſh on our Hands, to the great Detriment both of <hi>England</hi> and this <hi>Province,</hi> as I ſhall endeavour to ſhew hereafter; and this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be prevented by Law, no, altho' you ſhould make it Death.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, that formerly Silver was very plenty here. I anſwer thereto, the Trade then of this Province was very inconſiderable, to what it is now, and the Returns then made to <hi>Europe,</hi> were chiefly in Skins, which Skins were then of a great Value, and a Ship would carry a great Quantity of them. Alſo the <hi>Privateers</hi> brought in great Quantities of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Silver, and we likewiſe ſent a conſiderable Quantity of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:040043_0007_1015CE525369A678"/>Beef, Pork and Peaſe to the Iſlands, which brought us in, beſides what we wanted of their Produce, a great Deal of Silver; ſo it is no worder that Silver was then plenty here: But this is all ceaſed, and not to be expected again. And now if we will have any Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, we muſt look ſome other way; and I think we cannot find a better than our Paper-Bills, as being a Currency, which will never be carried away from us, and prevent the Inconveniencies that will follow from the coming and going of our Currency, and which we have found, by ſo many Years experience, to anſwer the Ends of any other Currency, for the Eaſe and Advantage both of Buyer and Seller, of the Foreign and Domeſtick Trader. For this you may buy, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can be got for any Money in this Province; nay, even Gold and Silver it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But becauſe there has been great Noiſe and Clamour againſt thoſe Paper-Bills by ſome Perſons, for no other Reaſon, that I could ever ſee, than that if they could have got them deſtroy'd, they would have made their Eſtates five or ſix times as good; and by others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not know what they talked of, but to keep up the Clamour, I ſhall endeavour to trace thoſe Bills from their beginning, and make ſuch Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as ſhall occur as I paſs along.</p>
            <p>And here I would have it obſerv'd, that I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relate what my Memory will readily ſuggeſt, having no other way at preſent to be inform'd, tho' I queſtion not but there are Perſons enough ſtill living, who can teſtifie, that I am pretty near the Truth.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Bills, as I have been inform'd, were firſt made ſoon after the <hi>St. Auguſtine</hi> Expedition, which, if I am not miſtaken, was about the Year 1701, or
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:040043_0008_1015CE54A4DDBA98"/>1702. The Quantity then made, was according to my Information Four or Five Thouſand Pounds, and thoſe paſs'd currant, as Silver, ſo that I remember in 1711, or 1712 I had a Piece of Eight for a Crown-Bill; then Pitch and Rice were from 15 s. to 17 s. 6 d. or there about.</p>
            <p>In 1712, or 1713 there were 52,000 Pounds made, and let out on Intereſt, which was of vaſt Advantage to many Men, and of great Uſe to the Country; and Rice and Pitch continued, until the Indian War, not to exceed 22 s. 6 d. the higheſt, notwithſtanding great Quantities of both thoſe Commodities began to be then made. In the Year 1715 began the Indian War, which was the greateſt Calamity that ever happened, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Country, but to our Bills alſo. For the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians now riſing up in Arms againſt us on every ſide, put the Country into ſuch a Conſternation, that the Thoughts of a great many were more, how they ſhould ſecure ſomewhat in ſome other place, and to get away if they could, than to ſtay here to defend the Country. And many perſons, nay even from <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> who could not go themſelves, ſent their Wives and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies off to the Northern Colonies. So that thoſe who had Paper-Bills in their Hands, would give any Price either for Silver or Gold, or our Produce, to ſend with their Families to provide for them, and to ſettle them in ſome other place, if they ſhould be forc'd to leave this Province. By this means our Bills were ſo much depreciated in their Value, that they were not worth above the one fourth part of what they had been.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Foreign Merchants, who had any effects here, gave Orders to their Factors, to remit thoſe Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to them; and a great many had their Effects ſent
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:040043_0009_1015CE583322FCF8"/>them, I believe to their great Loſs, and to almoſt the ruine of many, at a time too, when a great part of the Province were drove from their Settlements, and thoſe who could ſtay at their Houſes, were obliged to appear in Arms, ſo that there was but very little Produce made, and for that which was made, the Owner might get almoſt what price he pleaſed. Then did the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly likewiſe ſtamp more Bills, in order to pay the publick Debts, which Bills they entred into Meaſures to ſink again, ſo that ſome were ſunk and others not, according to thoſe Laws. Moreover Laws were made to iſſue out Rice Notes on Intereſt, and then other Laws to take that Intereſt away; and thus it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted between ſinking and making for ſeveral Years, till at laſt, in General <hi>Nicholſon's</hi> time there came out a Proclamation, to put the Laws in Execution, for ſinking the Money, which would have ſunk all the Money in the Province, excepting about 50,000 l. But he notwithſtanding paſs'd a Law to continue it, for ſome time longer, which diverted the Storm for that Seaſon. At length the ſinking it was to have been finiſh'd, all except 50,000 l. when there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men in the Province who could have put it all into their Cheſts, &amp; this at a time too, when the Bounty was taken off our Pitch, and that Trade almoſt ceaſed with it: At the ſame time our Rice Crops fell very ſhort, and the Country vaſtly in Debt, and what made our Caſe ſtill worſe, there was nothing ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the room of our Bills, to pay our Debts with Nay, our — were ſo ſtiff, that they would not declare, even Silver, or Gold, at any rate a legal Tender, and there was then no other Legal Money in the Province: Beſides, I much queſtion,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:040043_0010_1015CE5AA49785F0"/>whether <hi>Proclamation</hi> or <hi>Sterling</hi> would have ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſome Creditors, for their Demands ſeemed to riſe very faſt, and if thoſe Debts had been to be levied by Execution, (for the People could hardly have paid their Debts otherwiſe, unleſs they had ſold their Slaves at Vendue) this would not only have ſunk the Money, but the Country with it; but, thanks be to God, I hope this is prevented.</p>
            <p>Now let any disintereſted Man conſider, how our Money has been ſerv'd, what by ſinking it, and then paſſing it, ſometimes making it more, at other times leſs, one while Intereſt, another while none, and then the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions here about it, according as Mens Intereſts were for or againſt it's encreaſing or not; and then again their Writing to <hi>England,</hi> to endeavour to diſgrace it there, all this was enough to perplex and diſtract us, tho' we had had the beſt Money in the World: When any unbias'd Perſon, I ſay, has conſidered what I have here advanced, I think he will plainly ſee, that the Calamities, which have happened to our Money, have not been from the Nature of Paper-Money itſelf, but from the Indian War, and the ill Management it has met with ſince, by ſhifting it into ſo many Shapes.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this, our Money has kept near the ſame Value, for theſe Ten or Twelve Years laſt paſt: Nay, altho' there has been of late as much more added to it; for the Merchants Notes, for which they have 10 per Cent Intereſt, are 40- or 50,000 l. and the Publick Orders, for which they give 5 per Cent, are I think <hi>Sixty odd Thouſand Pounds,</hi> (a Thing which may look ſomewhat unaccountable to a Stranger) ſo that there is upwards of <hi>One hundred thouſand Pounds</hi> added to our Currency, nevertheleſs it has had no Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:040043_0011_1015CE5ECC867B60"/>on our Exchange: I am ſure, the Prices of our Commodities are not advanced by it. So that it is plain from Experience, it is not making move Money, (provided you do not make more than is convenient for a Medium to carry on our Trade) but it is the ſhifting it into ſo many Shapes, as I ſaid before, which is the Prejudice both to the Planter and Trader: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it material what it is made of, provided it be done by common conſent.</p>
            <p>There are ſtrange Notions in the World, concerning Money, as if nothing but Silver and Gold were fit for it; but the Uſe of it is only to carry on Trade with more Eaſe among Mankind, for which Silver and Gold have got the general Conſent. But if Paper, or Leather, or any other Thing, had as general a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it would anſwer the ſame End as well. It is not in the Power of any Perſon, or Country, I think, to alter this general Conſent, but only Time and Cuſtom: Yet any Country by Laws and common Conſent, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, may make any Thing elſe anſwer the very ſame as Silver, or Gold, for a Medium of Trade, within themſelves. As for Foreign Trade, that is carried on by exchanging the Produce or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture of one Country for another.</p>
            <p>Silver or Gold, or any other Money, are not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to the happineſs of Human Life, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' it be convenient and much eaſier for the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting of the Affairs amongſt Mankind: But it is a Fancy to think, that nothing but Silver and Gold will do. Whatever will procure a private Man Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for himſelf and Family, is a good to him as Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or Gold: For he can neither eat it, nor drink it, nor wear it; and whatever will procure a Prince wherewith
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:040043_0012_1015CE6058F9A570"/>to ſupport and defend his State, is as good as Silver or Gold to him alſo.</p>
            <p>I think I need not have ſaid half ſo much on this Head, becauſe Experience demonſtrates it; but I find it very difficult for ſome Perſons, to reconcile the Idea of Money with any Thing beſides Silver and Gold.</p>
            <p>The next Thing which I propoſed was, to offer my Thoughts on a Method, for Eſtabliſhing this Paper-Currency on a laſting Foundation, and in this I think there is no great Difficulty: For let a Law be made, to provide for the ſtamping of a ſufficient Quantity of Bills, ſuppoſe 250 or 300,000 <hi>Pounds,</hi> let this Money be lent out on Intereſt, as much to every Man, as ſhall be thought convenient, upon ſufficient Security; let this Law be made here by common Conſent, and let it be ſent home, to have the Royal Aſſent; and let it likewiſe be unlimited, ſo that it be not altered, until it be done again by common Conſent, and let this be kept as a <hi>conſtant Currency,</hi> until they can find ſomewhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſubſtitute in its room: For to deſtroy the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of any place, and ſubſtitute nothing in the 100m of it, is, I think, a prepoſterous Way of acting, and enough to involve any Place into Confuſion. Beſides, part of the Intereſt of this Money ſo lett out, may be applied towards the calling in the <hi>old Bills,</hi> until all the Money of the Province is upon one Foundation.</p>
            <p>If the Sum of <hi>Three Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi> ſhould be made, that, at 10 per Cent, will bring in <hi>Thirty Thouſand Pounds</hi> per Annum, enough ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to defray the ordinary Charges of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and be of great Uſe to many private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; tho' I think it would be much better that the Intereſt ſhould not be ſo high, becauſe it is (as times
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:040043_0013_1015CE63D8927760"/>are,) more than can well be made of it; and if it be put at a lower Rate, it will be a means to lower all the Intereſt throughout the Province: For all Perſons, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the immediate Gainers, muſt look upon high In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt as a prejudice to any Country: It makes the rich Man, who ſhould lay Schemes for Improvement, laſt, and the middle ſort work as it were in the Fire, ſo that their Affairs will not admit them to go upon any new Method, for improving and enriching the Province; if they ſuffer a few Loſſes, they are thereby ſoon ruin'd. Beſides it is better that the People ſhould pay ſome Taxes, than that the Intereſt of Money ſhould be high: For, to have no publick Taxes, will make the People reſty, when there is occaſion; and too heavy Taxes eat out their very Victuals.</p>
            <p>All Governments, I think, ought to take care, not to taxe their People beyond their Abilities, altho' it may be generally neceſſary and expedient, to lay ſome Kind of Tax upon them, yet it ought to be as eaſy as the Circumſtances of Affairs will poſſibly admit.</p>
            <p>By this Method, which I have propoſed, the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency will be no longer a publick Debt, but every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Man's Eſtate (who takes up the Money) will be bound for the Payment of it: In what? Why in Bills: For if I pay it in Bills, and am forc'd to give as much Rice, Pitch, or Silver for thoſe Bills, and if thoſe Bills will fetch as much Rice, Pitch, or Silver to the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of them, as their Value is: Is it not to all Intents and Purpoſes the ſame, as if I paid it in either of thoſe Commodities? But becauſe the Streſs of the whole Scheme lyeth here, I ſhall endeavour to ſearch this Matter to the Bottom.</p>
            <p>When the Publick lends this Money out, every
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:040043_0014_1015CE657AFEC498"/>Man takes as much as will diſcharge an equal Debt, or purchaſe him as many Commodities, as ſo much Rice, Pitch, or Silver; hereby the Creditor or Trader is not injured, by reaſon, he can command as much Rice, Pitch, or Silver, whenever he pleaſes, as we ſee from every days Experience. That is true, ſay ſome, but how will it be at the winding up of the Clew? Why the winding up of the Clew will be this, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſhall be thought fit, that thoſe Bills ſhall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Rice, Pitch, or Silver no longer, then he that is Poſſeſſor of thoſe Bills, will go to the Treaſurer, and ſay, Here I have ſo many of thoſe Bills, and they will purchaſe me nothing, now, what muſt I do with them? The Treaſurer will anſwer, I have ſuch and ſuch Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for the paying in of thoſe Bills by ſuch a Time, and if they are not paid, I ſhall ſue for them, now they muſt be forc'd to give you ſo much Rice, or Pitch, or Silver, as they are worth, in order to pay me: For if I ſue, I muſt not only have the Bills, but they muſt pay the Coſts of Suit.</p>
            <p>One Example I imagine will clearly illuſtrate this Matter. A Creditor comes to a Debtor for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, the Debtor goes to his Neighbour to borrow it, his Neighbour ſays, I have not the Money: But I will give this Gentleman my Note for the Money, if he will take that; the Creditor is content to take the Note, and gives the Debtor a Receipt, and the Debtor is diſcharg'd from that Man. Well, but, ſays the Neighbour, you muſt give me Security, that you will bring me my Note again by ſuch a Time: Content, ſays the other. Now, perhaps this Note has gone through Twenty Hands, ſince it went from the firſt Giver of it, but whoever is Poſſeſſor of that Note,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:040043_0015_1015CE69637DCCD8"/>when the firſt Giver wants it, will never part with it, until he has the firſt Value of it: If the firſt Debtor will not bring the Note, it is true, he, <hi>i. e.</hi> Neighbour muſt pay it himſelf; but then he will ſue his Security and recover his Damage, becauſe the Note was not brought according to the Agreement. I think this wants no Explanation.</p>
            <p>But now the Caſe is very different as to the preſent Money: For if that Proclamation which came over from <hi>England,</hi> in Governor <hi>Nicholſon's</hi> time, had been put in Execution, the Bills would have ſunk in every Mans Hands who poſſeſs'd them.</p>
            <p>I have not deſcended to every Minute particular, that may be neceſſary in ſuch a Bill, for if this Method ſhould be thought feaſible, that will eaſily occur to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man's Imagination, and to have been particular, it would have been neceſſary to enquire into all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the preſent Currency.</p>
            <p>All that remains now in the Proſecution of my firſt Deſign is, to enquire what Effect this may have on this Province of <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> and the Trade of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Effects of Paper-Money here, one would think I ſhould have no occaſion to ſay any Thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, becauſe the Effects thereof have been ſo viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Advantage of this Province: For let any Man look round him, and obſerve the vaſt Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made in this Country, for thoſe Ten or Twelve Years laſt paſt, which was, in a great meaſure, owing to our Paper-Currency, as might eaſily be ſhewed; and then let him conſider, that when our Money has been near ſinking, how the Country has dwindled, and as it were pined after it: And now again, when our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:040043_0016_1015CE6C113551B8"/>is a little help'd, the Country is, I thank God, in very flouriſhing Circumſtances. So that, if I went no further than Experience, it is very evident, that Paper-Money is for the Advantage of this Province.</p>
            <p>I believe there are but few Traders, who are not perſwaded, that plenty of Money is a vaſt Eaſe to Trade in any Country, and I think I have made it appear, that this Paper-Money is as good as Silver, for a Medium of Trade; but I think it is far better in relation to the Trade of this Province of <hi>South Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi> eſpecially if it were on the footing I propoſe: For had we Silver, the Traders, whenſoever it ſuited their Intereſt, would carry off our Money, inſtead of our Produce, (as I ſaid before) and this would have theſe Inconveniencies, that by this Means our Curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy would be leſſened, and in ſuch fluctuating Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as would much perplex us; or rather it would be ſoon brought to nothing, and we ſhould be left to ſhift without it, to the deſtroying of our Towns, and the Ruin of our ordinary and poor People, and I think <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the great Damage of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Trade; but of this hereafter. Add to this, that the carrying away our Money, and leſſening our Currency, would not be the only Inconveniencies, but our Goods would be left here, to periſh on our Hands, which would ſoon make us wary of making them, and put us upon a Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of making our own Clothes, and our own Liquor, within our ſelves, which, I think, would not then be ſo much for our Advantage as it is at preſent for us to buy them.</p>
            <p>But there is another Advantage from theſe Paper-Bills to this Province, upon the former Scheme. The Intereſt of them by this means would be a ſtanding
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:040043_0017_1015CE6F98B84AF8"/>Fund, to appropriate to any Uſe whatſoever, without taxing the People, which, I think, will be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to contrive without it. Beſides, in any publick Exigency the Legiſlature might command whatever Money they wanted, for it would be but offering any money'd Man the Bonds and the Security, which the Public ſhall have, from ſome of the principal of their Creditors, and have them aſſign'd over to them, until they were paid, and there is no one, who had it, but would lend Money on ſuch Security, having ſome of the principal Men, beſides the publick Faith, to make it good.</p>
            <p>But what need have I to ſhew the Advantages it will be to the Publick? Let any Man conſider, what a Turn it will give to the publick Credit, when the Legiſlature have the Command of the Principal and Intereſt of 250, or 300,000 <hi>Pounds</hi>?</p>
            <p>I think that this Opportunity ought by no Means to be neglected: For if there comes a War, (as we know not how ſoon,) this Country will have Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion enough for Money, it being a Frontier againſt two powerful Enemies, the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; beſides thoſe about us and amongſt us: And if we are then forc'd to tax our People for as much we ſhall want, I believe we ſhall ſoon bring them into very great Streights: For it is not here as it is in <hi>England,</hi> in caſe of a War; If the People of <hi>England</hi> are taxed heavy, this is all that they bear, and they have the ſame Opportunity to take care of their Affairs, as in times of Peace: but the Caſe is very different here, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may be dangerous for ſome Perſons, to abide by their Affairs, ſo that they will be ſo far from doing any Thing towards the Support of the Government,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:040043_0018_1015CE7123E75090"/>that they will hardly be able to provide for themſelves. And tho' at preſent it is Peace, yet look but on al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every thing that belongs to the Publick, and ſee if it is not in the greateſt Diſorder for Want of Money. I need not deſcend to particulars I ſuppoſe, and ſay what Condition our Fortifications are in, and how our Canons are almoſt all diſmounted, and how much our ſmall Arms want repair <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as to the Conſequences of this Scheme with reſpect to the Britiſh Trade, I think it is ſo far from being a Prejudice thereto, that nothing can be done which will ſupport the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Trade more. I believe this may ſeem a ſtrange <hi>Paradox</hi> to ſome Perſons, but I would have nothing regarded in theſe Papers, but what upon Examination ſhall appear to be Truth.</p>
            <p>The Deſign, as I ſaid before, of Trade, is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing of the Superfluities of one Country, Family, or Perſon, for the Neceſſaries that may be had from another. Now the Superfluities of our Country are Pitch, Tar and Rice, that is to ſay, we make more than we can uſe of them. The Superfluities of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> are the Woolen Manufactures, Iron of all ſorts, with ſeveral other Things that need not be named here: And as <hi>England</hi> wants our Produce, but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Pitch and Tar, ſo we want their coarſe Cloths, Iron and Linnens, and ſeveral other Things. Now provided the Merchant of <hi>England</hi> can tranſport to us thoſe Commodities ſo, that when he has his Returns in our Produce, he has acquired a ſufficient Gain; what does he, or what need he care, what we make Uſe of as a Medium for our Trade?</p>
            <p>It may be ſaid, that if we had Silver-Currency, it would perhaps ſometimes be more for his Advantage, to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:040043_0019_1015CE74E1D08E20"/>take away our Silver, rather than our Produce: I deny not but it might; yet I think I have made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that by the Nature of our Trade, he cannot have Silver from us long, unleſs we had Mines: But ſuppoſe they could ſhift Silver, and ſometimes carry it to, at other times bring it from <hi>England,</hi> this is no better than Stock-jobbing in Trade; it would be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carrying the Money from one part of the Kings Dominions to another, but nothing of any real Gain to the Monarchy.</p>
            <p>The Trade of one part of the Kings Dominions with another ought to be conſidered different from that, which we carry on with any Foreign Prince: For if the Merchant ſhould bring Money out of <hi>England,</hi> to purchaſe our Produce, then he would leave the Cloths and Iron, and other Commodities, that we want and they did not know what to do with, upon their Hands; and if he ſhould carry away our Money, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of our Produce, then he would leave our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to periſh on our Hands, when perhaps they wanted them in <hi>England.</hi> This is only playing Tricks and of no Uſe to the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But here is another ill Conſequence, which is worſe, to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Trade: The People of this Province by this will find, that their Supply, and the Sale of their Produce, will be ſo uncertain, that they will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to provide for their own Neceſſaries. Every Man knows, that it is very eaſy for us, to have more Wool and Cotton, not to ſay Silk, of our own Growth, than we can expend, and we have Perſons enough, that can manufacture it. Then we, who now take away more of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures than any other Province, nay, ſome ſay, than all the Provinces in <hi>America,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:040043_0020_1015CE78860EA8C0"/>ſhall be able to ſupply others from hence, and the ill Conſequences will be this, as to <hi>England,</hi> they will not only looſe the Sale of ſo much of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, but they will be forc'd to purchaſe our Produce at a dearer rate from other Places. So that I think 'tis very plain, that Want of Paper-Bills will not only hurt our Trade, but the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Trade alſo, and I could very eaſily make appear, were it within my Deſign, that Paper-Money in <hi>America</hi> will great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contribute towards the Wealth and Intereſt of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>; but I waive this, as being foreign to my Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Beſides both Wheat and Barley will grow very well here, and we could eaſily, now we are ſo well acquainted with the Country, provide Mills to grind it, and if we were to go upon that, that would cut off the Northward Trade, from whence we have almoſt all our Flower and Beer, and with our Produce they make Returns to <hi>England.</hi> So that, if our Paper-Money ſhould be deſtroy'd, it would cut off the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the Trade of this Province, and oblige us to provide our own Neceſſaries, much more to the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of thoſe that trade with us, than of ourſelves. For now, we trade for almoſt all our Cloathing, and all our Liquor, and Flower, and many other Things, which we could eaſily provide here. Therefore, I think, it is not only our own Intereſt, but the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of all who trade with us, that we ſhould have Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Money amongſt us. And I think, it is equally the Intereſt of all, that this Money ſhould be put on ſuch a Foundation, that it ſhould ſeldom or never be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, or at leaſt, not until they find ſomewhat that is better, to ſubſtitute in the room of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:040043_0021_1015CE7A10E33248"/>I have only one Thing more to offer, and that is, The Caſe is not now, whether we ſhall have Bills, or Silver, for Currency, but whether we ſhall have pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Money eſtabliſh'd by Law; or whether we ſhall have private Mens Notes paſs as a Currency? The Caſe is very plain, that the Merchant will not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied without ſome Currency, nor indeed will the Planter. There are many who wait to ſee what the Publick will do, in relation to thoſe Bills; and if it comes to that, that we cannot do without Bank-Notes, it is probable there may be many other Banks made: For I apprehend the Bankers find their Account in it, and it is like, others will be willing to reap ſome part of the Benefit, as well as they, ſo that we ſhall have the Country run into Parties and Factions about thoſe Banks, and we may depend upon it, they will do what they can to influence Elections and Votes in Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. How far indeed they will go, is not eaſy to determine: But this, I think, may be ſaid, that if the Legislature ſhould ſit regardleſs and let the Command of the Currency go out of their Hands, they would ſoon be obliged to ſubmit to thoſe who have the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of it, and then our Aſſemblies for ever after are to be only a Noſe of Wax.</p>
            <p>I have now done, and in the Proſecution of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, I think, I have aim'd ſolely at Truth, and the Intereſt of this Province, which I leave to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thoſe, who are more immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd</p>

            <head>POST-SCRIPT.</head>
            <p>THE foregoing Pages were wrote, about two years ſince, with a Deſign to lett ſome of my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſee my Notions concerning Paper-Curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: It has been read by ſeveral in the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, and I have been told, that ſome Perſons have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd it. I have ſeen a Copy that has been tranſcrib'd from it, but the Copy and Original are both very incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect; and to tell you the Truth, I have neither time nor Inclination at preſent, nor perhaps Capacity to amend it, &amp; I have no Friend that is capable, whom I am at preſent inclin'd to impoſe ſo hard a Task upon, beſides they have Buſineſs enough of their own. So that, Reader, thou muſt be obliged to take it as it is: But the Author is willing, as all others are, to throw from himſelf as much blame as he can, therefore the Printer is to take care of the Propriety of the Paragraphs, where a Capital Letter ought to be, with the Orthography, Pointing, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Trappings neceſſary to pleaſe the Reader, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh the Work, ſo that he is not to anſwer any thing for that. If it wants Juſtneſs of Thought, or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of Expreſſion, he has no way to make you Amends, except laughing at him will do; tho' he is not fond of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laugh'd at neither, unleſs you would offer ſomewhat in its room, and give him an Opportunity of laughing in his Turn.</p>
            <p>What he chiefly aimes at is this: He has two Things to offer to you in this <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> the one is, <hi>the State of the Paper-Currency at preſent, with ſome Remarks thereon.</hi> And as he has ſaid in the foregoing Pages, that Paper-Money in <hi>America</hi> will be an Advantage to <hi>Britain,</hi> he will offer one Inſtance, amongſt others, wherein he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it may be ſo.</p>
            <p>As to the preſent State of our Currency, there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two or three Years ſince a Law made to ſtamp <hi>One Hundred and Six Thouſand Pounds</hi> in Paper-Bills, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:040043_0023_1015CE806C989488"/>to exchange them for the old Bills, which are now iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing out, theſe are declared by the Law to be a Legal Tender for all Debts, and is all that can be look'd upon to be a <hi>Legal Currency</hi> in this Province Beſides theſe there were <hi>One Hundred and Four Thouſand Pounds</hi> ſtampt in what we call <hi>Public Orders,</hi> and iſſued out about two Years ſince, for the preſent Exigency. Of theſe Orders <hi>Twenty Seven Thouſand Pounds</hi> have already been burnt, and the Treaſurer has been ordered to get <hi>Thirteen Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds</hi> more to burn this Seſſion, ſo that there ſtill remains 64,000 <hi>Pounds,</hi> which are to be ſunk by a Fund, appropriated to that Uſe in Seven Years from their iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out. Theſe Orders are only a Legal Tender to the Treaſurer, but the Publick gives 5 per Cent per Annum In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to the Poſſeſſor of them, ſo that they paſs as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as any other Money in the Province.</p>
            <p>Now this is all the Paper Money that the Publick are concern'd in, when the old Bills, which are now exchanging, ſhall be burnt. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this there are <hi>Forty</hi> or <hi>Fifty Thouſand Pounds</hi> in Notes ſtamp'd by the Merchants. For when about 4 or 5 Years ſince the Country was in great Streights for Want of Money, as Sett of Merchants and others joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, and erected a ſort of Bank, ſtamp'd Notes and let them out at Ten per Cent <hi>per Annum</hi> Intereſt, which Notes with our Orders and Bills will make between <hi>Two Hundred Thouſand</hi> and <hi>Two Hundred and Sixteen Thouſand Pounds,</hi> when the 13,000 are burnt.</p>
            <p>This is the State of the Currency, as it now ſtands, and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Clamour and Noiſe againſt more Paper-Money, I do not find that any Man has had any Reaſon to complain, that he has been injur'd. And tho' we have now more than doubled our Legal Currency, by onr Orders and the Merchants Notes, yet this has had no Influence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice our Exchange, and I am ſure it has been to the Eaſe and Benefit of all ſorts of Perſons, except thoſe who wanted four or five times the Value of their Debts, as I have ſaid before. Yet this is but palliating the Diſtember, and no Cure: For this Province is in as great Danger of having their Debts paid in Proclamation-Money one time or other, as ever, and that perhaps very ſoon.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be loth, any thing that I ſhall ſay here ſhould put any body in a Way to bring it to paſs: However, I will offer them a Scheme, how it may be done, (altho' I ſuppoſe many of them know how to do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Advice) but if it ſhould put ſome in a Way how to bring it to paſs, I hope it may put others on a Method how to prevent it. It may be done after this manner: Sink the Publick Orders, as the Law directs (which ought to be done) and then if the Bankers burn their Notes as they come
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:040043_0024_1015CE81F4E7ABB0"/>into their hands, this deſtroys all but our Legal Paper-Bills, and if the Bankers ſhould ſue their Bonds, that would call in 40 or 50,000 <hi>Pounds</hi> more, then will our Currency be reduc'd to 40 or 50,000 <hi>Pounds,</hi> when there are 30 or 40 Men in the Province, any one or two of whom can put that Sum into their Cheſt whenever they pleaſe: Now that they will do ſo, I cannot ſay; but that Country is in a bad Condition, when it is in the Power of any two, three, or 40 Men, to bring it into ſuch a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma, eſpecially when it ſuits their Intereſt ſo to do.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe it ſhould lie in the Power of one ſingle Man to bring his to paſs, we have nothing I think then but his Goodneſs to depend upon. I have been inform'd, that there is one Man in to this Province, who has 100,000 Pounds at Intereſt; if ſo, he has the Command of almoſt all the Legal Money in the Province. Then I have been inform'd, there is a Lady, that has lately offer'd to give 40 000 Pounds in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> with her Daughter to any Man that ſhe likes, who will marry her. There are many others that have the Command of 40 or 50,000 Pounds. Now let any reaſonable Man judge, whether this Province does not <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> at the Mercy of thoſe Perſons, whenſoever they pleaſe. Or upon the whole, whether 200,000 Pounds this Currency, (which is but about 30,000 l. Sterling) ſuppoſe it were all Legal Currency, can be ſufficient to carry on the Trade of a Place, whoſe foreign Trade is upwards of 100,000 l. Sterling a Year.</p>
            <p>I have hinted in the foregoing Pages, that Paper Money would tend much to the Advantage of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> I ſhall here offer one Reaſon amongſt others, why I apprehend it muſt be ſo</p>
            <p>Paper-Money in <hi>America</hi> will always make <hi>England</hi> the Center of all the Silver that is brought into the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Dominions in <hi>America,</hi> and it will not only center in <hi>England,</hi> but abide there; the bringing it again to <hi>America</hi> will anſwer no Man's Account, for it will not paſs where Bills are plenty, to purchaſe Produce amongſt the Planters, except amongſt a few, to the full Value thereof. Now I conceive it a vaſt Advantage to any Prince in <hi>Europe,</hi> to have the Silver of his foreign Dominions center near him, this is keeping the Strength by him, and to have it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> on any Occaſion. I might inſtance the Inconveniency the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are under, by reaſon, that the greateſt Part of their Riches are at ſuch a Diſtance from them; but I am afraid of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Yet my Opinion is, that if the Currency in <hi>Britiſh America,</hi> with ſome other Things, were ſettled as I think they might be it would make the Engliſh Plantations of more Advantage to <hi>Great Britain</hi> to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
