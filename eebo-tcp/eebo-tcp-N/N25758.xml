            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I obſerve, however, and ſee it with pain, that we do not agree on the means and precautions to be taken. I preſume that it is for want of underſtanding one another, being unfortunate enough not to ſpeak your language, and an interpreter not being able to expreſs the true meaning of a phraſe which perhaps he does not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand perfectly. But this buſineſs being extremely important to me, and until we can agree upon this point, it is my wiſh, and I deſire, 1ſt. That you inſiſt on the conditions of the deed of ſale, which relate to the inſurance being performed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that the amount of the ſale be entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly covered as well as the premium, that in all caſes the recovery of the inſurance be ſufficient for the payment of what is due to me. 2<abbr>d.</abbr> That you do not give any order for the diſpoſal of the proceeds of this ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without my knowledge and conſent, that I may, if I think proper, avail myſelf of the fourth article of the contract, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the money in France or Hamburgh; and that we may come to a determination on this ſubject, be ſo obliging as to point out, and let me know the hour and place at which we may meet.

                     <p>I had the honor on the 29th of laſt month to requeſt of your Iſaac Gouverneur, on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of your houſe as my agents, that the Hamburgh veſſel the White Fox, Capt. Van Berend Edward Haberſtrok, might not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part till the inſurance to be made, purſuant to the contract with Meſſrs. Gomez, Lopez, and Rivera, was entirely completed as we had agreed, nor before the requiſite diſpoſitions were made to ſecure the application of the proceeds of the cargo of cotton and indigo ſold them on my account to the payment of what was due to me, having elected as I had a right to do, to receive the amount at one of the ports of diſcharge. Towards this end, I requeſted that my account with you might be prepared, in order to be adjuſted, and that I might be enabled by the poſſeſſion of the notes, or ſome competent authorization, and an authenticated copy of the contract of ſale, to receive the ſum which was coming to me out of the proceeds of the cargo, and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that it was my intention, thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and enabled to go in perſon to Europe, to attend the progreſs of the affair and receive the payment to which I was entitled, that I had accordingly engaged a faſt ſailing veſſel to carry me, and that the neceſſary arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being made, I ſhould depart the third or fourth inſtant, to give my perſonal atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the courſe of an affair of primary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to me, and thereby perhaps prevent any diſaſtrous conſequences which might otherwiſe ariſe. Theſe deſires, intentions and
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:034220_0032_0FFECAFCC39B33D8"/>
expectations were afterwards reiterated by me, but not being met as I could hope, I, on the 30th of May, wrote the letter of which a copy is herewith tranſmitted, and to which I received no anſwer. To my ſurpriſe, I learnt the next day that the veſſel had ſailed, and I am this moment ignorant that any ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate means have been attempted, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the application of the proceeds of the cargo, according to the wiſh which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and the right reſerved me by the contract, and I remain unfurniſhed with any documents or means by which I might take the meaſures that might appear to me adviſable. Even the precaution which I urged of addreſſing the houſe of Le Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teulx and Co. of Rouen, an authentica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted copy of the contract of ſale, to the end that they might take care of my intereſt, was at that time refuſed, and as far as I know has been omitted. To increaſe the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of my ſituation, I am left with the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment of having on my hands the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel I had hired to convey me to Europe, and may be expoſed to loſs from that ſource. In this ſituation I am ſorry to be obliged to think that your houſe has failed in obſerving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me a conduct correſponding with my rights and intereſt, and I conclude that it has made itſelf reſponſible for whatever loſſes may enſue.

                     <p>I received yeſterday your letter of the 6th inſt. with the accounts mentioned in it, which to my ſurpriſe takes no direct notice of my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to you of the ſame date. I paſs by the ſingular inſinuation which it contains, and confine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the real buſineſs in queſtion between us. I obſerve with regret, that (though you have dropped one of the items which originally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed your claim, the premiums of inſurance) you perſiſt in the idea of retaining excluſively in your command and diſpoſition, the whole of my property on the ground of a lien upon it, ariſing from your agency, which according to your own ſtatement amounts to little more then one fifth of its value, and adhere to your objection, to give me an authorization to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any part of it. It was ever my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as I conceived imported in my ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal propoſitions, to provide for your payment
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:034220_0040_0FFECBBD1871CC18"/>
and ſecurity to the extent of your juſt claims, as the condition of the authorization, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of you to receive what was rightfully coming to me. This was equally the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the co-operation propoſed by my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſixth, and I continue diſpoſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into that co operation upon this principle. It is true there are ſeveral items in your account about which we differ in opinion; yet <hi>I was</hi> and am ready to make ſuitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and arrangements towards a right adjuſtment of them, but I cannot imagine that this ought to have prevented, or ought now to impede precautions and meaſures tending to ſecure a due application of the proceeds of the cargo, and to put me in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the funds to which I am <hi>indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> entitled, and according to the election which was reſerved for my benefit in the terms of the contract. On this ground of putting me in a ſituation to poſſeſs without delay, that to which I am indiſputably enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, and of leaving your juſt and legal claims upon the property, and otherwiſe, unimpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I am ſtill willing to co-operate. But as I conceive there were pretentions and omiſſions in the firſt inſtance, which render you reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponſible for conſequences, as it may now be too late to repair the deficiency, as every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's delay increaſes the riſks, I ſtill make the offer of co-operation, on condition of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you in the ſame ſtate of reſponſibility in which you were prior to that offer. At the ſame time it will be explicitly underſtood, that in acceding to the co-operation on this condition, you do not incur any new or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional reſponſibility. With this explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:034220_0041_0FFEC1CE47F579C0"/>
I urge an immediate and poſitive anſwer whether you will concur in an arrangement on this baſe. Moments are precious. That which might be uſeful now, may quickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come uſeleſs by procraſtination. The nature of the co-operation will be an after conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. The terms to be ſettled between us, according to our mutual opinions, and the advice we may mutually take.</p>

                     <p>Your favour of yeſterday is received. It is not our wiſh to throw any embarraſſments in your way, but the magnitude of our claims, and our engagements in your behalf, render it proper that we proceed with caution. To ſtop the ſhip until the inſurance was comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was not in our power. Meſſrs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera ſtipulated to make inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but this might be done, as well after, as before the veſſel ſailed; and if neglected al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, it would amount to a breach of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract only, for which the veſſel could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. With reſpect to the premium for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance paid by us, although we omitted it in our laſt account, we do not aſſent to the force of your objection to the payment of it. The inſurance being effected for your bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and ſecurity, it is more reaſonable that you ſhould run the hazard of recovering back the premium than we, who act only as agents.
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:034220_0042_0FFEC1D04DE4C340"/>
To remove however every impediment to a ſettlement, and manifeſt a ſpirit of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, this charge has been for the preſent dropped. We cannot forbear remarking, that notwithſtanding your ſolicitude to obtain the authorization in queſtion, you conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uphold a claim upon us for certain conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, without pouring out in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we may have rendered ourſelves reſponſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Although we are not conſcious of any act which can give you this claim, and are therefore eaſy on this head, yet you cannot but perceive the impropriety of our admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that we have incurred this reſponſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which we ſhould do, were we to come to a ſettlement upon the terms propoſed by you. As to our lien on the notes, and other docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments relating to this tranſaction, we never had any doubt of our right to withhold them, and alſo to refuſe you any authority to act, until the whole of our demand was ſatisfied, and we ſatisfactorily ſecured againſt contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent claims. Indeed as the contract is in our name, and we are bound under a penalty of 20,000 dollars to endorſe on the notes, which are alſo in our favor, the payments as they are made, we might inſiſt (were we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as you inſinuate to create difficulties) upon all the the monies paſſing through our hands, or thoſe of an agent choſen by us, and for that purpoſe keep poſſeſſion of every pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per until the tranſaction was finally cloſed. But we are ſincerely anxious to put an end to a controverſy, which did not originate with us; for this purpoſe we beg leave to refer you to our letter of the 6th inſtant, in which we were ſo explicit as to the terms upon
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:034220_0043_0FFECB0C6859B640"/>
which we were willing to give you the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority you deſire, and to co-operate with you, that nothing remains to be added. To give you, however, a further proof of our wiſh for a ſpeedy and amicable arrangement, we are willing, if theſe terms are not agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to you, to ſubmit the whole matter to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitration.</p>

               <p>From this expoſition it appears, that all the claims of Meſſrs.

been reſerved to me, in the ſecond and fourth articles of the contract of ſale made to Meſſrs.

Gouv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erneur and Kemble, which will convince them of my diſpoſitions to come to an arrangement.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. To give me an authenticated copy of the contract of ſale, and authorization to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive one hundred thouſand dollars, in part of the obligations of Meſſrs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, out of the proceeds of the cargo, after the freight will have been paid, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after that payment only, enabling me fully to receive that ſum.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. To keep at their diſpoſal the balance of the above mentioned obligations, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to dollars 22, 415 37/100 for their bond to the cuſtoms, ſaving to myſelf the diſpoſal of this balance when the landing certificates are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and after the final ſettlement of our account.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. To drop for the preſent all alterations, reſpecting the reſponſibility which I have a right to exerciſe againſt Meſſrs. Gouverneur and Kemble, if the delay of the neceſſary diſpoſitions in France ſhould be productive of ſome injury to me in the recovery of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of the purchaſers of my goods.</p>
               <p>I preſume that Meſſrs. Gouverneur and Kemble will be ſo much the more diſpoſed to acquieſce to the above propoſals, that they have ever intimated the high opinion they had of the honeſty and ſolvability of Meſſrs.

                     <p>I cannot eaſily expreſs my chagrin at your reply of the 12th to my letter of the 12th in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. I had hoped that my propoſitions would have appeared to you entirely reaſonable, or at leaſt that you would have made me ſuch others in return of a ſpecific nature, as you did yourſelves approve. But inſtead of this, you merely refer me to your former propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of which I know not of any except a reference to arbitration—I am obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſtill more firmly than heretofore, that it is your determination at all events to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my whole property in your diſpoſition, till the final winding up of the ſpeculation by Meſſrs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, and the receipt by you in this country of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds of my cargo. Thus depriving me of the election which was referred by the terms of the contract, to receive the money coming to me in Europe, and diſappointing all the meaſures I had taken and projected on that baſis. I proteſt once more againſt this mode of proceeding, and all the conſequences of it, and I demand for the laſt time, that you forthwith furniſh me with an authenticated

This nevertheleſs is not to be underſtood as a final admiſſion of any claims on your part, which may not be according to law, and the uſage of trade; but as a preliminary arrangement for your eventual ſecurity. I further declare, that any other ſecurity you now rightfully poſſeſs is to remain unimpaired by your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with this demand.

we cannot but think that we have manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every diſpoſition to bring the controverſy between us to a ſpeedy and amicable deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. We have offered, and again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the propoſal, that we will deliver into your hands, all the papers and notes which regard this tranſaction without delay, upon your giving us ſatisfactory ſecurity in this country, to pay us in a reaſonable time our commiſſion, and ſuch ſums as we may have diſburſed, or made ourſelves reſponſible for, on your account, and alſo ſufficiently ſecure us againſt the payment of ſuch ſums as we may eventually be called upon by reaſon of our interference in this buſineſs. When it is conſidered that we have a right to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on immediate payment of the balance of our account, as the condition of our delivering up theſe papers, you cannot deem this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as unreaſonable. We are certainly not obliged to receive payment in France, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at a time when ſo many difficulties at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend getting money from that country, and was we to accede to the terms held out by your favor of this date, we ſhould be obliged to wait the event of an application for the money to Meſſ. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera in France, before we could have recourſe to you. Much more has already been ſaid upon this ſubject than was neceſſary; to conclude, we conceive ourſelves entitled to keep all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities we have at preſent, and were we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be litigious, we might, even now, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to you in a judicial way for payment of our demand.

<pb n="52" facs="unknown:034220_0052_0FFECB1E50F52BD8"/>
and engaging or encouraging the buyers to depart with the cargo immediately, you have placed me under the impoſſibility of putting into execution any of the diſpoſitions I had meditated, and now that I am deprived of my property as the mean of engaging the aid and interpoſitions of friends, a demand is made which for its indefiniteneſs alone is altogether exceptionable. I confine myſelf therefore to demanding of you without delay, an authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticated and certified copy of the contract of ſale made with Meſſ. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, and to declaring to you, that in as much as you have by the circumſtances which preceded the departure of the cargo, and in addition thereto by refuſing to comply with all the propoſitions and demands I have made you ſince, entirely deranged my plans, and deprived me of the power of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my funds in France, and of all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from the employment of them there, I hold you reſponſible, and ſhall inſiſt upon your reſponſibility for all loſſes, damages and diſadvantages which may enſue, including anindemnification for the derangement of the meaſures I had adopted for proceeding in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to France, to poſſeſs myſelf of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>

                     <p>We have received a letter from you this day, dated on the firſt of the month, wherein you make an enquiry reſpecting a certificate Mr. Barretto preſented to us to cancel our bond for ſome ſugars exported in the White Fox. We wanted Mr. Baretto to leave us the certificate, to ſee if it could be made to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that purpoſe, as it was irregular; but he objected to it before he had ſeen Mr. Cherri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot. Since then we have heard nothing further
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:034220_0054_0FFECB225E0BDD30"/>
about it—if it is in your poſſeſſion, it would be well for you to ſend it to us, and we will ſee what may be further needful. We have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the cuſtom-houſe the debenture of duties on your goods, which we ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for; but we muſt be indemnified for our bonds, or the needful papers muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to us to procure them cancelled. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections were given Mr. Gomez for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe reſpecting the goods under his care, but the ſugar queſtion he never had any thing to do with. That unfortunate adventure of Mr. Gomez, as we were well aware of, is like to turn to a ruinous account. After waiting ſome time at Havre, he has been obliged to expoſe it to further riſks and expences, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to Hamburgh for a market. Under all theſe diſagreeable circumſtances, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo reſpectable a property, we cannot help regretting that you have withdrawn yourſelf from us, and the ſteps you have been purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which muſt ultimately operate to your prejudice, while it appears to us ſo needful you ſhould nave aſſociated with us, to have concerted all neceſſary means for its preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſecurity, which we have at all times held ourſelves open to co-operate with you in, ſtill no endeavor will be wanting on our parts, at leaſt ſo far as we remain unreſtricted.</p>

me on the 17th inſtant; Mr. Barretto has not explained himſelf well to me, if he had, I would have ſent you the certificate in queſtion; it is annexed with this letter and you will ſee that they have drawn it in the name of John Richard, jun. as if he had been the ſhipper.

                     <p>With your favor of the 4th inſt.

Not being my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf well acquainted with the forms preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not knowing the inſtructions you may have given Mr. Gomez, I cannot judge in what point it is deficient, but I think there is yet time enough to have it corrected; and I return it with this letter, ſo that you make of it what uſe you think fit. The ſame let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter covered alſo copy of a letter from Mr. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mez to your houſe, dated at Hamburgh the 12th of Auguſt; with another copy of a letter which the ſame gentleman wrote the ſame day to his houſe of Gomez, Lopez and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vera. I am ſorry to ſee that affair turn out ſo unfavorably, and the loſs which thoſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen are likely to ſuffer from it. It is one of thoſe accidents to which every ſpeculation of that kind is expoſed; and I am yet in hopes that the reſult will not be ſo unfavora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as Mr. Gomez, ſeems to apprehend, by the ſtart of the price of cotton in the London

market, and a little patience. However the buſineſs may turn out. I ſhould hope that you have taken every precaution to inſure to yourſelves the whole amount of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Meſſrs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, and ſhould be very ſorry if you were to ſuffer on account of the iſſue of that operation. For my part I can do no more than to refer you to what I propoſed in my preceding let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and repeat again to you, that I am yet diſpoſed to co-operate with you, and ready to take the meaſures which might appear moſt adviſable for the preſervation of that property: provided always. that that co-op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration ſhall not in the leaſt impair my claim to your reſponſibility; reſerving to myſelf at the ſame time all my rights to it, as if ſuch a co-operation had not taken place.</p>

You are perfectly appriſed of the ground on which I conceive myſelf to ſtand. I have made a contract upon a definite price, and I have legal advice upon which I rely, that you are my guarantee in caſe of diſaſtrous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; looking to your reſponſibility, I feel tranquil for the event, and I cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to abandon or weaken ſo good a ground. With this ſaving, which I make once for all, as to what I now add, or may hereafter ſay upon the ſubject, I reply, to your firſt letter, that I think it would be for the intereſt of all concerned, that the proceeds of the cargo in Hamburgh ſhould be paid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of, and depoſited with ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or houſe, of unqueſtionable reſponſibility. Not being acquainted with the mercantile ſtanding of the American conſul, I can ſay nothing, but I have entire confidence in either of the houſes of Meſt. Bernherd and Nootna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, Lubbert and Dumas, and Matthuſon and Silem. To your ſecond letter, that were I in conſideration of the probably unfortunate iſſue of the adventure (rendered ſo however, as I conceive, from ill management) diſpoſed to make a voluntary ſacrifice, the propoſition of Meſſ. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera is too far ſhort of any thing that could reaſonably be thought to be liſtened to.</p>

                     <p>We wiſhed for your ſake to purſue ſuch joint meaſures, with reſpect to the property fold Meſſ. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, as the intereſt of all parties naturally pointed out, and under this impreſſion addreſſed you on the 7th and 8th inſtant. Your anſwer ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies us that you have no other object in view, than to induce us to take ſome ſteps that may place us in a ſituation of reſponſibility, which we do not think proper to incur. As to our having already rendered ourſelves anſwerable for the amount of the ſales, we do not believe you ſeriouſly entertain the idea yourſelf, and therefore think it unneceſſary to waſte much time in expoſing the futility of ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion. The only definite terms upon which you ever demanded the authorization, which is made the pretext of a miſunderſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, and which are contained in your letter of the 12th June, are ſuch as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ourſelves warranted in rejecting at that time, and have had no reaſon to change our opinion. The reaſons which influenced us have already been detailed, and are too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to require repetition. To diſcuſs this point further will neither be pleaſant nor uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. We are prepared to meet the queſtion
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:034220_0063_0FFECB33DDF41358"/>
in any ſhape you may chooſe to bring it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in full confidence of having diſcharged our truſt with integrity, and every proper at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to your intereſt, and a perfect reliance on thoſe tribunals which muſt ultimately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide between us. Under a conviction, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that it is your wiſh that we may aſſume a diſcretion which may eventually render us liable, we think proper to inform you that we ſhall not empower any houſe in Europe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any payment on the notes we hold, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an expreſs authority from you in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for that purpoſe. Unleſs we receive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit directions from you on this head, we ſhall think it our duty to wait until the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is remitted to this country, or until we receive advice that it is placed in Europe, ſo as to be commanded by us without any riſque. Your anſwer reſpecting an arbitration, is not leſs evaſive than other parts of your letter; but it is not ſurpriſing that ſuch ſhould be your language, ſo long as you "feel tranquil about the event," and while you rely with ſo much confidence on our guarantee in caſe of diſaſtrous conſequences. We have only to add, that although a further correſpondence will probably be productive of no ſalutary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, yet we ſhall ever continue ready, until the final ſettlement of this buſineſs, to liſten to ſuch inſtructions as you may have a right to give, and we can conſiſtently with our own ſafety and intereſt purſue.</p>

I will only reply to one point of it; you miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in ſuppoſing I wiſhed to draw you into any new reſponſibility; my only intention is not to releaſe you from any to which you are now ſubject. I thought I had ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained myſelf on the ſubject of the depoſit of the proceeds of the cargo at Hamburgh; but ſince I have been miſunderſtood, I will add, that I entirely approve of the idea, that if the depoſit be made with either of the houſes I have indicated, or with any other we may agree upon, I will take the riſks of it to the extent of the ſum depoſited, and it ſhall in no wiſe be deemed to implicate you in any new reſponſibility. But I conſent to this only on the ground that I cannot obtain from you an authorization to receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds myſelf, which I ſhould prefer, and if obtained, would immediately depart for Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh. The ſum I ſhall receive will be in deduction for the one I claim, preſerving at the ſame time, all my right for the remaining balance, which I mean to maintain in either caſe.</p>

               <pb n="77" facs="unknown:034220_0077_0FFECB50C46CF710"/>
2dly. For not giving to the defendant autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to receive at the port of diſcharge, ſo much of the proceeds of the ſales of ſuch cotton and indigo as remained, after deduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſum ſufficient to cover the plaintiffs for the general balance of their account, and other claims and reſponſibilities, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their agency.</p>
            <p>This action, in its conſequences affecting private intereſts, of uncommon magnitude, has been ſtrenuouſly contended between the parties, in every ſtage of its progreſs which would admit of urging their adverſe and totally irreconcilable pretenſions.</p>
            <p>In the ardor of controverſy they have however conceded theſe points, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their conceſſion would not admit of a doubt—That in ordinary caſes a factor is bound to comply with the inſtructions of his principal, in the diſpoſition of the ſubject entruſted to his care—That the factor has a lien on it, for all his advances, commiſſions and reſponſibilities; and that he is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellable to part with the ſubject or its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, <hi>if not converted into caſh,</hi> until thoſe demands are completely ſatisfied; for, if the ſubject is converted into caſh, the reaſon for pledging the whole for the ſecurity of the factor ceaſes; as by retaining the ſum he is entitled to, or reſponſible for, he can incur no farther riſk of failing in an ultimate ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>No doubt could ariſe reſpecting the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of theſe principles to this caſe, while
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:034220_0078_0FFECB52D6DC4798"/>
the ſubject remained to be diſpoſed of in the cuſtomary mode of ſale, at the place it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears both parties originally contemplated a diſpoſition of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>But the parties having by a contract, to which they all aſſented, made an arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to convey the ſubject to Europe, their ſituation was by that means varied as to the local exerciſe of their reſpective rights— which, I take it, by that contract they reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally agreed to modify, ſo as to carry it into effect in all its parts, preſerving their mutual relations and rights, as principals and factors.</p>
            <p>The queſtions which aroſe on the contract were:</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Whether the plaintiffs were bound to elect to receive the proceeds of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of factorage in Europe?</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Whether the defendant had a right to exact payment of the ſurplus from the plaintiffs in Europe, after ſatisfying the whole amount of their commiſſions, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and reſponſibilities? and</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. If the plaintiffs were bound to make ſuch election and were ſubject to make ſuch payment, what ought to be the meaſure of damages?</p>
            <p>As to the firſt point—the ſubject of factor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was evidently entruſted to the plaintiffs for the benefit of the defendant—his intereſt
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:034220_0079_0FFECB5465C25608"/>
was the primary object to be attended to in the conduct of his factors, and every inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given by him, not incompatible with their rights, it was their duty to conform to and carry into effect—the election reſerved to the plaintiffs by the contract with Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, muſt of neceſſity be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, as for his benefit and emolument, as inſeparably incident to the truſt confided to them—for every diſpoſition of the ſubject, purſuant to the inſtructions of their principal, could only be for his advantage excluſively; unleſs poſitive contract detracted from, or made a different modification of his intereſts. From the moſt attentive examination of the contract given in evidence at the trial, I could diſcover no traits in it, to ſatisfy my mind that it was the intent of the parties that this obvious principle ſhould be departed from—the reſervation of the rights of election to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the proceeds of the cotton and indigo, either at New-York or in Europe, and the premium to be received by the plaintiffs, if they ſhould elect to receive in Europe, were, in my opinion, clearly intended and ought to enure ſolely for the benefit of the defendant —if ſo, the plaintiffs could not, after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to export the ſubject, avoid a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the inſtruction of their principal <hi>as to the exerciſe of the right of election,</hi> without violating their duty.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond point it appeared to me that tho' the plaintiffs were not compellable to part with the ſubject confided to them as factors, <hi>to be diſpoſed of at New-York,</hi> ſo as to permit its exportation, without being ſatisfied
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:034220_0080_0FFECB55F41223A0"/>
for the whole amount of their commiſſions, advances and reſponſibilities; yet, that by aſſenting to the exportation, they virtually ſtipulated to exerciſe the rights they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, as factors, at the port of diſcharge in Europe; by that means relinquiſhing the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cality of their agency and conſenting to leave it at large and thus attaching their rights and duties to the ſubject, to be exerted and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed at whatever place it might be tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, in purſuance of the contract, to which they were parties, and thus placing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſame ſituation, and preſerving the ſame relations at the port of diſcharge, as they were placed in, and as ſubſiſted between them at New-York, previous to the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contemplated by the contract.</p>
            <p>If this is a legal and conſiſtent expoſition of the contract, it would reſult, that tho' the plaintiffs might retain the controul of the property of their principal, <hi>either perſonally or by ſubſtitution of others, whom they ſuppoſed truſt worthy, and for whoſe conduct they were content to be reſponſible,</hi> until it was converted into money; yet the inſtant it was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in their hands, or thoſe of their agent, it was their duty, after retaining the amount of their commiſſions, advances and reſponſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, to pay the ſurplus to the defendant, at ſuch port of diſcharge, if he ſhould require it, and that as their agency was indiſpenſible to enable the defendant to avail himſelf of his rights, under the contract in queſtion, by becoming parties to it, they expreſſed their readineſs to do, and ſubmitted to the obligation of doing every thing in their power, and which
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:034220_0081_0FFECB5890DD8140"/>
could be reaſonably expected from them as factors, to facilitate the arrangement they had acceded to, ſo as to produce conſequences moſt advantageous to their principal, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing their own rights.</p>
            <p>In this caſe the contract was made with, and in the names of the plaintiffs; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant muſt rely upon their agency, or on authority received from them, to enable him to exert any power in controverting the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination, or obtaining any part of the proceeds of the ſubject; if they refuſed their aid to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect both or either of theſe objects, they were unattainable by the defendant. I hold that he had a right to exact from the plaintiffs this aid, ſo far as to enable him to receive the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of the proceeds of the ſubject, after ſatisfying the demands of the plaintiffs at the port of diſcharge—that their refuſal to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe him to receive ſuch ſurplus, <hi>was a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their truſt, which amounted to full evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of an intent to convert the whole to their own uſe, regardleſs of the intereſts or inſtructions of their principal;</hi> and that for ſuch violation they became liable as in caſes where the fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor had contrary to the inſtructions of his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal credited, or credited for a longer period than that limited by ſuch inſtructions—In both theſe caſes it has been held, that the giving ſuch credit is evidence of a diſpoſition by the factor on his own account, and <hi>that he is anſwerable for the amount to his principal, whatever may be the reſult of ſuch ſales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In giving this opinion, I lay out of the caſe, as totally inapplicable to its real merits, the
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:034220_0082_0FFECB5A17EC2D10"/>
various propoſitions reciprocally made and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the parties—as propoſitions made by one party which the other was not oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to accede to, they could not influence a deciſion on the queſtions which aroſe in the cauſe—The demand made by the defendant in his letters of the 15th of June, is ſuch an one, as I think, the defendant had a right to exact a compliance with, and that the refuſal on the part of the plaintiffs to comply with it, was in effect a dereliction of the relation in which they had placed themſelves as factors to the defendant, of which he might avail himſelf, to hold them accountable for the whole ſubject, by ſubſtitution, inſtead of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mez, Lopez and Rivera.</p>
            <p>As to the third point—</p>
            <p>All the facts reſpecting this tranſaction in Europe, were of a nature incapable of being developed in the courſe of legal inveſtigation <hi>here,</hi> till ſeveral months after the veſſel ſailed from New-York—The defendant's right of action, however, accrued upon the refuſal of the plaintiffs to comply with his demand. If we depart from the ſubject, and do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider its value as ſettled by the contract to which the plaintiffs were parties, I know of none, to which a reſort could be had for the meaſure of damages; and I have, when this cauſe was firſt preſented for my judicial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, ſought it with a conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſolicitude, ariſing from the important conſequences of that opinion, as affecting the plaintiffs. I could not, however, ſatisfy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that any other meaſure could be reſorted to

on this occaſion; and if the withdrawing the ſubject from the controul of the principal—if aſſuming an abſolute and uncontroled diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of it, amounted to a converſion of the property of the principal by the factors to their own uſe, the amount of the ſales to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mez, Lopez and Rivera, deducting the amount of the plaintiffs' demand, appears to me, to preſent not only a reaſonable, but the only rule of damages in this caſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the reaſons which induced the opinion I have given in this cauſe. I refrain from ſaying any thing reſpecting the ſtate of the pleadings as the opinion of the Supreme Court was not particularly required relative to them. It will therefore ſuffice merely to obſerve, that I ſuppoſed the plaintiff had ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his action.</p>
            <p>Mr. Juſtice BENSION.<note place="margin">Mr. Juſtice Benſon's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> The queſtion in this cauſe is, whether the truſt which the plaintiffs <hi>in error</hi> took on themſelves for the defendant <hi>in error,</hi> was ſuch, as that he had a <hi>right</hi> to demand from them what he did demand in his letter of the 15th June, 1795? The facts from which this <hi>right</hi> is to ariſe, are thoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which <hi>preceded,</hi> and including, the ſailing of the ſhip, with the cotton and indigo on board, on the 31ſt May; none of the <hi>ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> facts, or matters found by the verdict, have varied or in any manner aflected the <hi>truſt,</hi> as it then <hi>was,</hi> and are therefore no further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial or uſeful to be conſidered, than as ſome of them may ſerve, in the nature of <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial</hi> proof, to give a more full and diſtinct knowledge of the preceding facts; hence it will
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:034220_0084_0FFECB5DDE3640C0"/>
be perceived, that the queſtion doth not depend on the law of <hi>principal</hi> and <hi>factor,</hi> as to the rights of the latter to retain; the rules of law on this ſubject, generally, are acknowledged to be, that the factor hath a right to <hi>retain</hi> the property of the principal until his <hi>legal</hi> demands againſt him are paid; that however ſmall the amount or the <hi>demands,</hi> and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>great</hi> the amount of <hi>property</hi> may be, the factor is not held to deliver up any <hi>parcel</hi> of the property, but may retain the <hi>whole;</hi> that he hath a right to retain, not only until he ſhall be <hi>reimburſed</hi> ſuch ſums as he may have paid, but alſo until there ſhall be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited</hi> with him a ſum, competent to anſwer whatever he may have become liable to pay on account of his principal, as well <hi>contingent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> as <hi>abſolutely;</hi> and that he is not held to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a <hi>ſecurity</hi> of any kind inſtead of a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit,</hi> nor a depoſit of <hi>goods</hi> inſtead of a depoſit of <hi>money;</hi> but <hi>theſe rules being applicable to caſes only where the principal demands the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to be delivered up to him, are inapplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the preſent caſe;</hi> in which the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, ſo far from demanding to have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty or any part of it delivered up to him, demands only a <hi>mean</hi> to enable him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in another and diſtant place, where the the ſame is payable by the vendees of the property, <q>the ſum which may remain after the factors ſhall have <hi>deducted</hi> and <hi>reſerved</hi> at their <hi>diſpoſal,</hi> a <hi>ſum</hi> completely ſufficient to cover them for the general balance of their account, <hi>however claimed;</hi>
               </q> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this ſtatement of the queſtion, it will alſo be perceived, that to ſeek for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular rules or for adjudications preciſely and
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:034220_0085_0FFECB5FEC85F300"/>
throughout appoſite to it, would be fruitleſs and unneceſſary; and that for a deciſion on it, there muſt be a reliance wholly on <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> or <hi>diſcernment,</hi> in applying to the caſe, in its peculiar and appropriate circumſtances, the univerſal maxim, that <hi>with the</hi> END <hi>the</hi> MEANS <hi>alſo muſt be intended to be granted.</hi> In this view of the controverſy, and of the grounds on which it reſts, it neceſſarily divides itſelf into the following enquiries: 1ſt. Is the ſtip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation in the fourth article of the contract, reſerving an option to the vendors to receive the whole, or any part of the conſideration money for the goods, in Europe, in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to leaving it to be receivable in this country, to be adjudged to have been intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the intereſt or benefit of the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, the <hi>principal,</hi> inſtead of being for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or benefit of the plaintiffs, the factors or <hi>ſubſtitutes;</hi> or in other words, is the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt or benefit of the defendant, ſo to be <hi>ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arated</hi> from, or <hi>paramount</hi> to, any intereſt or benefit of the plaintiffs, as to be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>end</hi> to have been intended to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by that ſtipulation? If ſo, then— 2dly. Was what the defendant demanded from the plaintiffs, in his letter to them of the 15th June, 1795, a fit and reaſonable <hi>mean</hi> to that end?</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the firſt of theſe queſtions, it would appear to me that a mere ſtatement of it precludes the neceſſity of proof, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the truth of the affirmative; if the ſtipulation ſpecified in the queſtion, is for the intereſt or benefit of the plaintiff, I do not ſee a reaſon for not ſuppoſing every
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:034220_0086_0FFECB61F496A198"/>
other ſtipulation in the contract equally ſo— I cannot even imagine a rule or teſt by which the ſtipulations intended for the intereſt or benefit of the party <hi>principal</hi> are to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminated from thoſe which were intended for the intereſt or benefit of the party <hi>factors;</hi> ſo that the reaſoning, as I view it, to prove that the ſtipulation under conſideration was for the intereſt or benefit of the plaintiffs, muſt terminate in a concluſion that the whole contract was intended for their intereſt and benefit. The ſale of the goods, the perſons to whom, and the terms on which they were ſold, were by the <hi>"expreſs direction"</hi> of the defendant; the plaintiffs accept and ſubmit to the direction; they are mere inſtruments to effect what he had determined was for his <hi>own,</hi> not what was for <hi>their,</hi> intereſt and ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efit—The ſale was of the unſold reſidue of the cargo of the ſhip Cleopatra, received by the plaintiffs to be ſold on account of the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant; had the plaintiffs a <hi>different</hi> or a <hi>greater</hi> intereſt or benefit in the <hi>laſt</hi> ſale than they had in the <hi>preceding</hi> ſales? In their accounts, their <hi>commiſſions</hi> are the only intereſt or ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efit they claim. On a calculation of <hi>whoſe</hi> profit or advantage was it to be, to elect hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſideration money for the goods made payable in Europe, inſtead of leaving it to be payable in this country? Was it to be on a calculation of profit or advantage to the plaintiffs? To whoſe <hi>uſe</hi> was the <hi>premium,</hi> or in effect <hi>additional price,</hi> of five per cent. on the goods to be, in the event of the option to receive the money in Europe; to the <hi>uſe</hi> of the plaintiffs or to the <hi>uſe</hi> of the defendant? Moſt certainly to the uſe of the latter; and
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:034220_0087_0FFECB6387640F30"/>
that conſideration alone appears to me to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh an argument deciſive on the point; and I will only add, that the truth of the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the ſale in queſtion, and every term and condition of it, is to be conſidered as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the intereſt or benefit of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, <hi>primary</hi> to, and <hi>excluſive</hi> of, any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or benefit to the plaintiffs, except their commiſſions, is ſo evident to my mind, that it is not without difficulty I can perſuade my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that I have rightly underſtood the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs' counſel, when I ſuppoſe they meant to contend for any thing different from or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the ſecond queſtion alſo, I think the truth is not leſs obvious, and that it ought almoſt to ſuffice merely to ſtate, that to ſuppoſe the right to elect to have the money receivable in Europe, ſhould be reſerved for the intereſt or benefit of the defendant, and conſequently that the plaintiffs were bound in virtue of their truſt, to exert this <hi>right</hi> for him, whenever he ſhould require them, and that they ſhould at the ſame time have a <hi>right</hi> to refuſe to enable him to receive the balance there, but to withhold it from him, until, after having been received there by them or their agent, it ſhould be remitted to this country, is to ſuppoſe two <hi>rights</hi> in one and the <hi>ſame</hi> ſubject, claimed by oppoſite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties againſt each other, and which can never be made to <hi>conſiſt together.</hi> Where was the inconvenience or grievance of which the plaintiffs could complain, if they were to be held to pay the defendant his balance in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope? The buſineſs of receiving the money
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:034220_0088_0FFECB660A001EA0"/>
from the vendees of the goods, of making out and ſettling the account with the defendant, and paying him the balance, could have been done by an agent; not ſo conveniently to the plaintiffs, it may be admitted, as if done in this country; but was the inconvenience of doing theſe acts by <hi>another</hi> inſtead of <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> or <hi>abroad</hi> at a ſea-port in Europe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of at <hi>home,</hi> ſuch as the law muſt intend the hazard of it not to have been within the truſt or agency? Surely the law muſt intend the reverſe—Waiving, however, the <hi>general</hi> intendment of law, it might ſtill be aſked, what would be the <hi>particular</hi> intendment in this caſe, from the <hi>expreſs,</hi> and as it were <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> proviſion in the contract, that the money, if the option ſhould be to receive it abroad, ſhould be payable alſo to the <hi>agents</hi> of the plaintiffs? The objections to the demand of the defendant for an authorization to receive his balance in Europe, as declared by the plaintiffs themſelves in their letter, in anſwer to the demand, are, <q>that they were not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to receive payment in France, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially at a time when ſo many difficulties attended getting money from that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and that if they were to accede to the terms held out by the defendant, they would be obliged to wait the event of an application for the money to the vendees of the goods, before they could have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the defendant for the payment of the balance of their account.</q> I have already expreſſed the reaſons of my opinion, that the defendant had a right to demand from the plaintiffs to declare an option to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the money in Europe; and it is only
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:034220_0089_0FFECB689D23ABC8"/>
requiſite in addition to ſtate, that this right of the defendant could never depend on a greater or leſs degree of difficulty, if any, to the plaintiffs in getting their portion of the money, their commiſſions and diſburſements, from that country; and further, that if the plaintiffs had at any time brought a ſuit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the defendant, or as they have expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, <q>had recourſe to him, or applied to him in a <hi>Judicial</hi> way,</q> for the payment of their demand, it is not poſſible he could have avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf of the authorization from them, to receive his balance in Europe, to any poſſible purpoſe of defence whatever. Let the <hi>fact that the plaintiffs had furniſhed him with the authorization, and on the terms as contained in his letter,</hi> be put in the form of a <hi>plea,</hi> and it will inſtantly be diſcovered to be ſcarcely better than a nullity.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the reaſons for my judgment, that the defendant, as plaintiff in the court below, had maintained his iſſue on the firſt count of the declaration.</p>
            <p>The remaining queſtion is, as to the rule by which the jury have aſſeſſed the damages, and which from the record appears to have been "the amount agreed on by the contract as the price of the cotton and indigo," Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whether the aſſeſſment of them is by the court as their <hi>immediate</hi> act, or by a reference to a jury, are to be according to <hi>definite</hi> rules; but where there can be no definite rule in the caſe, as for inſtance, where <hi>exemplary</hi> or <hi>implied</hi> damages would be warranted, ſtill the
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:034220_0090_0FFECB6A4EC53060"/>
aſſeſſment is not to be <hi>wholly</hi> without rule, it is to be according to <hi>legal</hi> diſcretion or arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trament. The caſe of a returned proteſted bill of exchange, is a caſe of a <hi>definite</hi> rule; the damages are to be twenty per cent. on the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of the bill, with intereſt from notice of the proteſt, and the coſts of the proteſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any enquiry, and conſequently without any addition or diminution, in conſideration that the plaintiff hath or hath not ſuſtained more or leſs, or any ſpecial or indeed any <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> damage whatever—Suits in trover and in treſpaſs for carrying away goods, are alſo ſo far uſually caſes of definite rule, as that the damages are to be at leaſt the value of the goods at the time of the converſion or treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, or in other words, at the time <hi>when the right of action accrued,</hi> without regard to any ſubſequent deterioation, however caſual—I ſtate <hi>at leaſt</hi> the value of the goods, for the damages may be made <hi>to exceed</hi> that amount where the withholding or taking the goods was <hi>aggravatedly</hi> injurious—The caſe now before the court is within the reaſon, and therefore within the rule, in the caſes of tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and treſpaſs. I have already mentioned ſuch of the rights of the factor as can have any relation to the queſtions between the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent parties, I now briefly ſtate his duty <hi>gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally</hi> to be, that he is to follow the orders of his principal, and for a breach of the orders he is to anſwer in damages to his principal; if the breach is <hi>merely</hi> PARTIAL, and as to certain parcels or particulars only, he ſhall not be held to anſwer further than as to ſuch parcels or particulars; but if the breach is ſuch as to involve the <hi>whole</hi> of the property
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:034220_0091_0FFECB6BED0C5558"/>
intruſted to him, he ſhall then be held to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for the value of the <hi>whole</hi> of the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and as ſuch value was, <hi>at the time the breach of orders took place;</hi> and if the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſiſted in credits, to anſwer <hi>to the amount of the credits—</hi> The principal may from that moment abandon to him the <hi>whole</hi> of the property. Whenever the principal, in order to a ſuit againſt the factor for not delivering up the property when ordered or required, tenders a ſum for commiſſions and other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, the principal tenders and the factor refuſes at their peril reſpectively; for if it ſhould appear that the ſum tendered was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, the principal will recover the value of the property at the time of the tender; and the rule is the ſame, whenever the factor refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to do an act which the principal was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to demand, and which affects the <hi>whole</hi> of the property of the principal. If ſuch are the duties of the factor, and if ſuch is the meaſure of the damages or retribution to the principal for his injury, where theſe duties have been violated or departed from, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that the damages were duly aſſeſſed, in the preſent ſuit, is obvious.</p>
            <p>I cloſe with remarking, that the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy between the parties may be ſatisfactorily reſolved in this as its cauſe, that the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs have accepted an agency, and bound themſelves to execute it in a <hi>foreign</hi> country, if their principal ſhould at any time elect it to be moſt for his benefit, without previouſly calculating and providing for their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and ſecurity, if it ſhould then come in competition with his; and that afterwards
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:034220_0092_0FFECB6E384117B0"/>
and when <hi>too late,</hi> under apprehenſions, either miſtaken or founded, and as to the juſtneſs of the remark, it is immaterial which, of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or diſadvantage of ſome kind, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to execute it, unleſs they can have eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry benefit both of profit or ſecurity, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven convenience, equally as if they were to execute it <hi>at home.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Caſes delivered into court by the parties reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectively, omitting the recapitulation of the facts found by the ſpecial verdict.</p>
            <p>Caſe on the part of the plaintiffs.<note place="margin">Caſe on the part of the plaintiffs in error.</note> The Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Court having given judgment for the defendant, who was plaintiff below on this verdict (three judges to two) the plaintiffs (the defendants below) have proſecuted a writ of error, returnable into this honorable court, and aſſign the following reaſons, why the ſaid judgment ſhould be reverſed—</p>
            <p n="1">I. Becauſe no good cauſe of action is ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the defendant's declaration, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal averment of which is directly contrary to a written contract under ſeal, and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably contrary to the ſenſe and meaning of the parties to the ſuit. The averment allud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to is, that the right to receive payment in Europe, <hi>out of the proceeds,</hi> was intended for the ſpecial benefit of Mr. LeGuen. It is an eſtabliſhed rule of law, that no averment ſhall be admitted, to contradict a deed under ſeal.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Becauſe, the jury have <hi>not</hi> found that this right was for the ſpecial benefit of the
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:034220_0093_0FFECB7042344CF0"/>
defendant. The court, therefore, cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume this was the caſe, eſpecially as it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to another part of the verdict, which ſtates, that the contract, as it appears on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, was made by the intervention and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs conſent and direction of Mr. LeGuen; and being an averment eſſential to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant's recovery, it ought to have been proved as any other fact, and might have been proved as ſuch, if it had really been the caſe by producing an agreement in writing for that purpoſe from the plaintiffs.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Becauſe, it is repugnant to every rule of conſtruction, to admit any interpretation of a written contract, directly oppoſed to the <hi>latter of it.</hi> To receive the money in Europe might have been a principal inducement to the plaintiffs' lending their names to this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action. Whether it was ſo or not, it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſay, that by the terms of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, <hi>they</hi> are to have the election, and <hi>they</hi> are to appoint an agent to receive the money.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Becauſe, no good conſideration is ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the promiſe alledged to be made by the plaintiff, in the firſt count of the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is ſaid it was their <q>
                  <hi>duty</hi> to purſue the direction and requeſt of the defendant, touching the exerciſe of this right,</q> and that in conſideration of this duty, they agreed ſo to do. The conſideration here ſtated, is ſubſequent to the ſale, and precludes every idea of an antecedent agreement on the part of the plaintiffs, to purſue ſuch direction and requeſt; ſuch agreement is not even pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to exiſt. To determine it was their duty
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:034220_0094_0FFECB7202DCE518"/>
ſo to do, the court muſt firſt get rid of a contract, which ſo far from impoſing it as a duty on them, left <hi>it at their option</hi> to make the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or not as they pleaſed, and left to them <hi>alone,</hi> and not to Mr. LeGuen, the choice of an agent. The words of the contract are, they may at <hi>their option</hi> receive, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Becauſe, the declaration is altogether uncertain and contradictory. In one part it avers, that the right reſerved to receive <hi>the proceeds</hi> in Europe, was for the advantage of Mr. LeGuen, ſubject only to the <hi>lien</hi> and <hi>right</hi> of the plaintiffs, to <hi>have and receive</hi> the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral balance of their account, and to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for ſuch other claims and demands as they might and <hi>ſhould</hi> be entitled to and have, by reaſon of their agency for the ſaid defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. Thus admitting, without any <hi>qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and in its fulleſt latitude, the lien for which the plaintiffs contend. But by another averment it is ſtated, that the plaintiffs were bound to give him an authority to receive theſe proceeds, after certain reſervations and deductions, that is, as he explains it, after leaving in the hands of Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, a ſum ſufficient to ſatisfy them for their general balance and the claims afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. Which two averments are. directly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to each other, the one admitting, and the other deſtroying every idea of a lien.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The declaration is uncertain in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpect, and therefore alſo had. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant avers, that he requeſted the plaintiffs to elect to receive the proceeds of the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>or</hi> ſo much as would be due to him, after
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:034220_0095_0FFECB74113D3D10"/>
certain reſervations and deductions. But it does not appear what was the amount of thoſe reſervations and deductions; on the contrary, it reſults from the verdict that theſe very ſums were matters in diſpute between the parties. It became, therefore, impoſſible to give the authority in the way it was demanded.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. The declaration is defective in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpect; the action being brought for a refuſal to give the defendant a power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the price of the cotton and indigo in Europe, after certain reſervations, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to aver, as the very gift of the action, that the property was ſold in Europe. This averment is neither found in the declaration, nor is the want of it ſupplied by any part of the verdict; and unleſs ſuch ſale took place, the power became nugatory, and no damage could enſue from a refuſal to give it.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. The declaration is alſo had, becauſe all the inferences and deductions made by the defendant, in the firſt count, are contrary to the known and eſtabliſhed laws which govern relations between principals and factors.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. But if the defendant's conſtruction of the contract be juſt; if the right to receive the proceeds in Europe was reſerved for his ſpecial benefit, it does not at all weaken the plaintiffs' defence; becauſe, as factors, they had a valid lien, or a right to hold all the notes and ſecurities of the defendant in their hands, and alſo to keep at their control and diſpoſal the price of the goods, until actually
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:034220_0096_0FFECB76AB5DE208"/>
received by them or their agent, not only as a ſecurity for the general balance due to them, but for all their incidental charges and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and alſo for their indemnification againſt all engagements and reſponſibilities which they had come under on the defendant's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. They had alſo, in virtue of this lien, a right to refuſe the defendant poſſeſſion of any of the papers, and every facility towards obtaining his money, until it was actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them or their agent in Europe, or until they were paid, their advances, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorily indemnified againſt every claim, however contingent or remote.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of the court below was, that they had a right to inſiſt on actual payment, not only, for their balance, but for every e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventual engagement whatſoever.</p>

            <p n="10">X. Becauſe the plaintiffs' lien, if any they had, which is admitted by the declaration, extended to the whole ſubject; not to a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or reſidue of if, as it is pretended; and therefore they were not bound to liſten to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny propoſal, however plauſible, which in the ſmalleſt degree impaired their ſecurity. A lien is defined to be, <q>That <hi>hold or tie</hi> which a man has upon goods, or other things in his cuſtody, or on <hi>the price of goods in the hands of buyers,</hi> and by which he has a right to retain them until he is <hi>paid</hi> what is <hi>due</hi> to him, and alſo the <hi>ſums for which he may have become ſurety for his principal.</hi>
               </q> This is the only true and natural definition of a lien; a lien in the <hi>qualified</hi> and <hi>reſtrictive</hi> ſenſe of the defendant was never heard of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til this day. If a <hi>ſingle authority,</hi> out of <hi>any hook whatever,</hi> can be produced in ſupport of this novel and unheard of doctrine, the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs will abandon this ground of their defence as deſparate and untenable.</p>
            <p>The Judge who delivered the opinion of the Supreme Court in this cauſe, admitted that a factor may <hi>retain</hi> for his diſburſements and reſponſibilities entered into on account
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:034220_0098_0FFECB7A37111F48"/>
of his principal; and the defendant admits that by his propoſal of the 15th June, it was implied that the plaintiffs ſhould be paid and indemnified, as a <hi>condition</hi> on which <hi>only</hi> he was to receive the authorization required.</p>
            <p>It is alſo contrary to the underſtanding of Mr. LeGuen, as expreſſed in his letters.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. If the plaintiffs had this lien, they ſay they were not bound to accede to any one of the offers of the defendant. Theſe offers will be examined at large in the argument on their part, and it will be ſhewn that every one of them went to the total deſtruction of their lien as factors.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. But if the plaintiffs' lien was only of the partial kind admitted in <hi>one part</hi> of the defendant's declaration, they contend that all his offers were inadmiſſible, as any one, if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded to, would have put it in the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's power to have defeated <hi>the operation of it altogether,</hi> even within the limits he admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to exiſt. This will be alſo clearly ſhewn in the courſe of the argument.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. The plaintiffs maintain there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this tranſaction which differs it from the common caſes of principals and factors. If any clauſes were inſerted in this contract of ſale for the benefit of the principal, is not this the caſe in every ſale by a factor? Have not all ſuch ſales in view, as a primary object, the principal's benefit? But was it ever before heard that the particular terms of the ſale, or the mode or place of payment, controled the
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:034220_0099_0FFECB7BC2E45F28"/>
lien of the factor who negociated it? Suppoſe Mr. LeGuen had wiſhed to receive his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in Lapland or Peru, would it not be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to ſay that Meſſrs. Gouverneur and Kem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble would <hi>alſo</hi> be bound to follow the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers to thoſe countries? Would it not on the contrary be a ſtrong reaſon for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting on payment here, before they gave their principal any authority to receive what was coming to him abroad. The truth is, the terms of a contract between a factor and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer have nothing to do with the rights of the former as againſt the principal—Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and various as ſuch contracts muſt have been in this country and in Europe, ſuch a propoſition was never heard of before. Here again the plaintiffs require <hi>but one ſolitary</hi> le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal authority in ſupport of this doctrine, and they will give up the controverſy. A lien is a right ſo attached to and inherent in a fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as to be paramount to every claim of his principal—It is a right conferred on him by law, not depending on the will of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal—No agreement is neceſſary to give it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy—no mode in which the principal may chuſe to vend his goods—no way in which he may fix the payment—no country to which the purchaſers may be going—no nation of which the principal may be a citizen—no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience to which he may be expoſed—no terms for his benefit which may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into the contract of ſale, can alter, diminiſh or deſtroy thoſe rights to which his factor becomes entitled, according to the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of trade, the moment he ſteps forward in that capacity to aſſiſt in or lend his name to the ſale. Doubts and perplexities, inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant

and endleſs, as the nature of contracts, would reſult from a contrary doctrine, in the place of that ſimple and uniform rule which now prevails. At preſent, every merchant knows he has a lien or hold on the goods of his employer, for the balance of his account and his collateral undertakings. It matters not whether he is directed to takenotes payable at Havre-de-Grace or at the bank of New-York; his lien in either caſe is preciſely the ſame: In the former caſe, indeed, the lien of an American factor ſhould be more highly favored and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, becauſe his riſque, where payment is to be made abroad, is conſiderably enhanced.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. But if the plaintiffs were bound to receive payment in Europe and to purſue the purchaſers thither—they contend that their lien extended to the whole price of the goods in that country, and that they were not bound to give a power to the defendant to receive any part of theſe proceeds until they were actually received by an agent of their appointing, in whoſe hands they might make the reſervations and deductions which the defendant allows they were entitled unto.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. If the plaintiffs had no lien whatev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they were not bound to give the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant the authority he demanded without an <hi>indemnity</hi> which has never been offered.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Becauſe the contract being in the name of Gouverneur and Kemble and containing a heavy penalty, no ſuit could be brought upon it, but in their name; if then they had given Mr. LeGuen the authority he aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:034220_0101_0FFECB7FD86452E0"/>
and <hi>when</hi> he aſked it, and he had abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, they might have expoſed themſelves to the penalty of the contract, or at leaſt to an action of covenant for damages. That he might have abuſed it, appears from what is ſtated to be the cuſtom of Normandy.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. They were not bound to give the authority <hi>until a ſale,</hi> becauſe the property being warranted American, and Mr. LeGuen being a French citizen, ſuch authority in caſe of diſcovery would have expoſed the cargo to capture and condemnation, and thus have vitiated the policies which in caſe of loſs were the plaintiffs only ſecurity. If by ſuch an act the plaintiffs had expoſed the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, the purchaſers alſo would have had a claim on them for damages.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. The defendant ought not to recover; becauſe, if the plaintiffs have been guilty of a neglect or breach of duty, the defendant ſuſtained no injury, and therefore is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to any damages. The jury refer it to the court to ſay whether the plaintiffs have made themſelves liable to pay the amount a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on by the contract, as the price of the property. This ſufficiently ſhews, whatever arguments may be urged to the contrary, what rule the jury obſerved in aſſeſſing dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and precludes every idea of any ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial injury.—From the whole verdict it man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifeſtly appears none was proved or ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>Every action on the caſe <hi>ex contractu,</hi> is brought to recover "pecuniary ſatisfaction <hi>for the damage ſuſtained."</hi> It does not follow
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:034220_0102_0FFECB81E36FF5E0"/>
that an injury is the neceſſary conſequence of every miſconduct in a factor—caſes can and will be put in the courſe of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to illuſtrate this poſition, and even to ſhew that a principal may ſometimes be <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited</hi> by a palpable breach of orders in the factor; in which caſe it would be abſurd to, ſay the latter ſhould make him any compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. That in an action on the caſe, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on contract, the plaintiff is entitled to a compenſation commenſurate only with the <hi>damage actually</hi> ſuſtained, is one of thoſe ſelf evident legal axioms which almoſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the poſſibility of demonſtration; caſes however, numerous and in point will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
            <p>The following are the words of Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Blackſtone on this ſubject:</p>
            <p>
               <q>A promiſe is in the nature of a <hi>verbal covenant,</hi> and wants nothing but the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of writing and ſealing to make it abſolutely <hi>the ſame.</hi> If therefore it be to do any explicit act, it is an expreſs contract as much as any covenant, and the breach of it is an <hi>equal injury.</hi> The remedy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is not exactly the ſame, ſince inſtead of an action of covenant, there only lies an action <hi>upon the caſe,</hi> for what is called the undertaking of the defendant; the failure of performing which is the <hi>wrong or injury</hi> done to the plaintiff, the <hi>damages</hi> whereof a <hi>jury are to eſtimate and ſettle</hi>—as if a builder promiſes to build a houſe and fails, the party has <hi>an action on the caſe</hi> againſt the builder for this breach of his

            <p>A few pages further on, he proceeds: <q>Every one who undertakes any office, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, truſt or duty, contracts with thoſe who employ or entruſt him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it with integrity, diligence and ſkill, and if by his want of either of thoſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>any injury accrues</hi> to individuals, they have <hi>therefore</hi> their remedy in <hi>damages, by a ſpecial action on the caſe.</hi> If an officer of the public is guilty of <hi>neglect of duty,</hi> or a <hi>palpable breach of it,</hi> as if the ſheriff does not execute a writ, or <hi>willingly</hi> makes a <hi>falſe return,</hi> in both caſes, the party aggriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall have an action <hi>on the caſe, for da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages to be aſſeſſed by a jury.</hi> If a ſheriff ſuffers a priſoner during the pendency of a ſuit to eſcape, he is liable to an <hi>action on the caſe.</hi> An attorney who <hi>betrays</hi> the cauſe of his client, by which it miſcarries, is liable to an <hi>action on the caſe</hi> for a <hi>repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> to his <hi>injured</hi> client.

Profeſſor Wooddeſon alſo, in his view of the law, declares that ſuch actions are for the breach of a promiſe, <q>to recover <hi>pecuniary ſatisfaction</hi> for <hi>the damage thereby ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </q> If the court can bring themſelves to believe contrary to the whole tenor of the verdict, that the defendant has ſuſtained da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage by our negligence or default in not giving him a power to receive the proceeds of certain property in Europe, which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they ever exiſted ſell far ſhort of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of the notes—if, we ſay, the court can poſſibly bring themſelves to believe that the plaintiffs are liable and that the defendant has actually ſuffered damage to the amount of the notes, then and then only can they affirm this judgment—their undertaking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as ſtated on record and as implied by law, not to pay a certain ſpecific ſum, but the <hi>damages</hi> which may have accrued to their employer by their default, with which da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages the amount of the notes has no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection.</p>
            <p>Even in actions on the caſe for a deceit, although ever ſo groſs a fraud be practiſed, it is neceſſary that ſome <hi>injury</hi> be ſuſtained, or no action will lie; the rule in this caſe being, and it has been ſettled for centuries paſt in England, that "fraud, without <hi>damage, gives no cauſe of action."</hi> In ſuch caſes, ſays Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſon, <q>it is neceſſary to remember that the ground of complaint be, that there be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual detriment injuriouſly ſuſtained.</hi>
               </q> If this be the caſe, in actions where fraud has been practiſed, how much more ſtrongly does the rule apply in actions on the caſe where miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:034220_0105_0FFECB880B5087B8"/>
or negligence only and no fraud is alledged; where difference of opinion on a point of duty, but no wilful deception, has occaſioned a controverſy between the parties.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. Becauſe the rule of damage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for in the preſent caſe is directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the defendant's declaration. The action is brought for the plaintiffs' refuſal to give an authority to the defendant to receive <hi>"the proceeds"</hi> of certain property in Europe after certain deductions. He then avers, and which averment was <hi>material,</hi> that after ſuch deduction there would remain due to him a large ſum of money. But why make the averment, if the plaintiffs became re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible to pay <hi>the whole amount of the notes,</hi> the moment they refuſed this authority, whether the property was ever ſold in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope or not? For the deciſion of the ſupreme court warrants the ſtrange principle that the plaintiffs would have been liable for this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous ſum, even if the property had been ſunk or captured, the moment it left the wharf, in which caſe it is evident the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant would have been injured by croſſing the ocean in queſt of a property which as to him no longer exiſted.</p>
            <p>On a cloſe examination of the ſpecial ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, and the evidence ſtated in it, nothing appeared to enable the court to judge wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the property was ſunk at ſea, burnt in port, or ſold at the beſt market in Europe; they refuſed to admit evidence to enlighten them on this point; as appears hereafter. If the veſſel had ſunk the day after ſhe left
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:034220_0106_0FFECB898EF329E8"/>
New-York, which may have been the caſe for aught that appears to the contrary, Mr. LeGuen's ſecurity was in his policy of inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which it was agreed ſhould be made for that expreſs purpoſe; but the deciſion of the court inverts this rule: their language is, that whether the property was ſunk, burnt, or ſold at a high price, in all events LeGuen is to be paid the whole amount by Governeur and Kemble, and they are to look to the purchaſers and underwriters for their reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſement.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. Becauſe, this being an action on the caſe, for a miſconduct in the plaintiffs as factors, would be no bar to a new ſuit againſt them for <hi>money had and received,</hi> when the price of this property is recovered, if ever that be the caſe, from the purchaſers. The defendant's council have taken care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to let it appear by the verdict, that no evidence was given in the preſent action on the count for <hi>money had and received;</hi> thus after paying fifty thouſand pounds to a man who has not been injured by their act a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle cent, they may hereafter be compelled, in an action which is now pending againſt them by Mr. LeGuen in the ſupreme court, to refund to him the ſum which may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually received by them from the purchaſers. The ſum recovered in this action muſt be as a compenſation for the ſpecial damage ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the agent's default, which cannot deprive the principal of his right to receive the real amount of ſales of his property, or the whole ſum, if they are able to pay, on the notes of the purchaſers; nay, nothing
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:034220_0107_0FFECB8B2E36C7B0"/>
can prevent his compelling the agents to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render him thoſe notes for proſecution either before or after the termination of this ſuit.</p>
            <p>Such ſtrange inconſiſtencies will ever be the conſequence of a departure from plain and known rules.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. To place in a more ſtriking view the illegality of the judgment, as it reſpects the damages, let us again recur to the nature of the action. It is brought for an injury the defendant is preſumed to have received by the refuſal to grant him a certain authority. Hence if he had been injured at all, he ought to have recovered ſomething <hi>as damages,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and above and independent of the price of the property—becauſe the price he was always entitled to, when it came into the hands of the plaintiffs, whether they had been guilty of a miſconduct or not; ſo that if this judgment is to conclude the parties, and Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, were ſolvent, the plaintiffs pay no damages at all for their miſconduct, and the defendant is compelled by their act to receive his money in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, without even the five per cent. premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, or any other equivalent for the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which is impoſed upon him by the plaintiffs. This ſhews both that the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not conclusive between the parties, and that factors, by ſubſtituting themſelves as paymaſters, can always compel the principal to receive his money where they reſide, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any compenſation for their miſconduct, although it be expreſsly agreed that he ſhall receive it elſewhere.</p>
            <p n="20">
               <pb n="108" facs="unknown:034220_0108_0FFECB8D38F09D48"/>
XX. The only caſes in which a factor can be liable for the whole price of the goods, are, where he has ſold contrary to his inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or where he has received the whole property, or it has been loſt by his default, ſuch as releaſing the debt to the purchaſers, or neglecting to proſecute for it when due; but even here, he would be permitted to go into circumſtances, to induce the jury to give other and leſs damages; at any rate the fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor would be liable for the real value of the goods only, not for any nominal or ideal va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue at which they might have ſold on credit, or by deception. In the preſent caſe, it is not pretended that any part of the property or its price has been loſt by our default, but only that the defendant has been injured by not receiving the proceeds of it, after certain reſervations, in Europe. Suppoſe theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, after the reſervations mentioned, had only amounted to one hundred dollars, and it will be ſhewn preſently that they did not amount even to that ſum, will this honorable court ſay, that it is poſſible any man by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to give another a power to receive one hundred dollars in Europe could injure the latter to the amount of fifty thouſand pounds, or ſubſtitute himſelf to the perſon who was to pay that ſum? This would be ſaying in other words, that forty pounds in Europe, are worth fifty thouſand in this country. This would be turning a ſpecial action on the caſe, into a penal one; it would be inflicting a fine by way of puniſhment on the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, inſtead of compenſating the plaintiff for the <hi>real injury</hi> which he might have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The truth is, it matters not in what
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:034220_0109_0FFECB8F4C271D50"/>
country money is to be paid, the party fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherever he be ſued, muſt pay the ſum only with intereſt. Bills of exchange alone form an exception.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. It was ſaid on the trial, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of the plaintiffs extended to the whole ſubject, and that therefore there could be no other criterion of damages than the value of the whole property. This is not juſt as an argument: in point of fact it is untrue, and directly againſt the record. It is not correct reaſoning, becauſe a default may often take place as to the whole ſubject, and yet the factor not be liable for the whole ſum. If an inſurance broker is directed to make inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance on property for one hundred thouſand dollars, and neglects ſo to do, he is certainly reſponſible, but for what? If the veſſel arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſafe, he would be liable for nothing; if loſt he would be liable only for the <hi>actual value</hi> of the property. Other caſes will be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the argument.</p>
            <p>But it is untrue in point of fact, that the default here extended to the whole ſubject. The plaintiffs are ſued for not giving the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant an authority to receive in Europe the <hi>proceeds</hi> of the cargo, after keeping at their diſpoſal a ſum ſufficient to pay and guarantee them againſt certain claims. To theſe <hi>proceeds</hi> then, after the reſervation, and no farther, did the default extend.</p>
            <p>Admitting however for a moment, that the agents in this caſe became liable for the whole amount of the <hi>ſubject.</hi> By the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:034220_0110_0FFECB915AECBEF8"/>
muſt be meant that preciſe object, to which the authorization related. What was that? The authority demanded was "to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive whatever ſum ſhall remain of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds of the goods ſold," after deducting certain ſums. The plaintiffs refuſe this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. What then is the <hi>ſubject?</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>proceeds</hi> in Europe, and not the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of the notes. Nevertheleſs the court did not require the defendant, and refuſed to permit the plaintiffs to prove what the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of thoſe proceeds were. To ſhew that this argument is correct, let us ſuppoſe that the authorization had been given; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant admits that in ſuch caſe he could only have been entitled to receive by it in Europe the balance of <hi>the proceeds,</hi> after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting certain ſums. Withholding the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorization, was therefore in effect only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding that balance, what ever it was.— Hence it is clear, that to receive the <hi>balance of the proceeds</hi> in Europe, was the <hi>ſubject</hi> of the demand, and of the refuſal. This was the <hi>ſubject</hi> of the controverſy, and the ſubject for which the plaintiffs were liable, if for any thing. What the amount was, does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. It will be remembered, the plaintiffs offered, but were not permitted to ſhew it; a tolerable eſtimate however may be formed.</p>
            <p>Gomez, when at Hamburgh, expected to loſe <hi>ſixty</hi> per cent. All agree the markets were bad, and the ſpeculation ruinous. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct <hi>ſixty</hi> per cent from £48966, the price of the cotton and indigo, and there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, rejecting fractions, only £18587.— The plaintiffs advances and liabilities on the
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:034220_0111_0FFECB937748FFF8"/>
15th June, 1795, were £28718 17 3. Thus then the proceeds, if any there were, fell ſhort of what the defendant was willing to leave at our diſpoſal, the ſum of £10131 17 3. Where then were the monies which the defendant was to have received? How is the plaintiffs' default as to the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject made out, when it applied, if at all, to an object which had no exiſtence.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. It was alſo contended on the trial, that the price of the property being fixed and aſcertained, every other meaſure of da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage was <hi>uncertain,</hi> and liable to difficulty. But are not damages <hi>uncertain</hi> in their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nature? Why are a jury ſummoned, but to render them <hi>certain?</hi> Is not this the caſe in actions of covenant, trover, detinue, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, aſſault and battery, and in every ſpecial action on the caſe? If in all theſe, damages are uncertain, why ſhould a <hi>certain meaſure,</hi> never before heard of, be applied to this caſe? Even if the factors had ſold of <hi>their own head,</hi> the price of the property would not form a <hi>certain</hi> meaſure of damage. It might not be worth as much as it ſold for, and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of mitigation would be liſtened to. How comes it, that the defendant's counſel have not ſtated in his declaration, that by reaſon of their default, the plaintiffs <q>became liable and aſſumed to pay to the defendant the amount of the notes</q>? The truth is, ſuch an extravagant idea never oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to them. With all their talents, they did not dare to hazard a declaration in ſuch form; and yet ſuch a declaration would have been good, or this judgment muſt be bad.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="unknown:034220_0112_0FFECB95802143A0"/>
Notwithſtanding all this pretended uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, which is always more or leſs the caſe, never did an eaſier or more familiar meaſure for aſcertaining damages preſent itſelf than in this caſe. The plaintiffs refuſe to give the defendant an order to receive the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds</hi> of certain property in Europe. Where then lays the difficulty of aſcertaining their amount? They either exiſt or do not; if they do not, there could be no injury; if they did, their amount might eaſily be known; the plaintiffs offered to aſcertain it. This ſum, with intereſt, after large deductions, ſhould have been the utmoſt extent of the recovery.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. From the reaſoning in the laſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, it alſo appears, that the ſupreme court did wrong in rejecting the teſtimony offered by the plaintiffs, to ſhew there was no <hi>ſpecial</hi> damage. In actions on the caſe, every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which can aſſiſt the jury in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an eſtimate of the extent and nature of the injury, ought to be admitted. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is with propriety termed <hi>a ſpecial action on the caſe;</hi> that is, the plaintiff is to recover according to all the circumſtances of his caſe. If the wrong he complains of has been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with any injury, he recovers accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; if not he recovers nothing, or only nominal damages. Thus in actions <hi>on the caſe,</hi> for eſcapes againſt ſheriffs, and for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct in attornies, they are not bound, the ſheriffs, to pay the whole ſum due to the plaintiff in the original ſuit, nor the attorney, the whole ſum due to his client. This will be exemplified by ſeveral very ſtrong caſes. The court on ſuch occations, after the default
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:034220_0113_0FFECB9789435680"/>
is eſtabliſhed, permit the defendant to prove every circumſtance which may tend to ſhew either that the party has not been injured at all, or to an inconſiderable degree. Yet all this was denied to the plaintiffs here: They are able, if permitted, and would have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if their evidence had not been over-rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, moſt concluſively, that their refuſal to give the power in queſtion, had not only worked no injury to Mr. LeGuen but had proved beneficial to him.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. Becauſe by rejecting the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which is made the ground of the bill of exception, the court precluded the plaintiffs as factors, from every defence, which even the purchaſers themſelves might have avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves of. A man is not always held to pay the price agreed upon: Thus the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers may, and no doubt will, in the action brought againſt them on their notes, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to prove, in avoidance of the contract al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, that they were groſsly deceived and impoſed upon in the purchaſe of this cotton and indigo; that they were warranted of qualities very different from the truth. If they make out this proof, nothing is clearer than that they will be relieved againſt the payment of theſe notes; or that they will have to pay only the real value of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. How iniquitous then may be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult? Gomez, Lopez and Rivera may have a verdict againſt the factors, on the ground of fraud or deception, and yet the latter may be compelled to pay the whole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount. If in both caſes there be ſpecial
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:034220_0114_0FFECB990E9EFF08"/>
verdicts, it is to be hoped they will be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed together; they will reflect ſingular <hi>credit</hi> on the judicial annals of this country. If any fraud was practiſed, as is contended by the purchaſers, it was by the defendant himſelf, who negociated the ſale; yet as the notes are in the names of the agents, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief will be againſt them: Thus may inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent factors be puniſhed for the fraud of their principal.</p>
            <p>The caſe of a horſe which was ſold for a barley corn, a nail doubling every nail, is well known; the animal at that rate came to 500 quarters of barley; the jury howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er gave only eight pounds, which was his real value. Yet if the ſale had been made by the intervention of a factor, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits a ſingle miſtake or default, he muſt pay the contract price, however exorbitant or unconſcionable that may be. Thus if Mr. LeGuen had ſold a ſingle horſe, for as much as he was to have had for the cotton and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digo, no one can doubt the purchaſer would have been relieved againſt ſuch a hard bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Yet if the proceeds of the horſe was to be paid in Europe, and his agent ſhould refuſe him an order to receive theſe proceeds, which in all probability would not exceed one hundred guineas, nothing could exempt him, if this judgment be affirmed, from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his principal the laſt farthing of the contract price. For aught that appears, the purchaſe of the cotton and indigo was almoſt as hard a bargain. To loſe £30,000, as may fairly be inferred from the verdict, the purchaſers did, was no trifle.</p>
            <p n="25">
               <pb n="115" facs="unknown:034220_0115_0FFECB9A926D1E08"/>
XXV. There is no evidence, nor is the fact found, that <q>after certain deductions and reſervations, there would remain due to the defendant, for the reſidue of the amount of the ſaid notes a large ſum of money,</q> which is another material aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his declaration, and ought to have been proved. It is true, it is ſtated there would be due a reſidue on the <hi>amount</hi> of the notes; but this, like ſeveral other allegations in the declaration, is inaccurate. The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers being only bound, as appears from the declaration and contract, to pay the notes as far as the proceeds extended, the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant could not demand, nor they give a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to receive any monies beyond the amount of theſe proceeds. It ſhould therefore have been ſtated, that <q>there would remain due to the defendant in Europe, for the reſidue of the proceeds of the ſaid cotton and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digo, a large ſum, &amp;c.</q> of this we ſay there was no proof.</p>
            <p n="26">XXVI. The conſideration ſtated in every declaration ought to be ſome certain act; matter or thing by which the defendant may be benefited, or the plaintiff incur ſome trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or inconvenience, that is, either a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to the plaintiff, or an advantage to the defendant. The declaration ought alſo to aver, that the plaintiff has on his part, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the terms on which the promiſe was made, or that he has offered to fulfil them, and ſhewn that readineſs and willingneſs to do it which the law requires. To apply this law; the conſideration ſtated in the preſent declaration, is, that Gouverneur and Kem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:034220_0116_0FFECB9D25AB1100"/>
were to be allowed <q>a commiſſion of two and an half per cent. upon the amount of the ſales, and ſuch other commiſſion as the courſe of their agency and the uſage of trade might entitle them to.</q> But in no part of the declaration is it averred, that this commiſſion was paid or tendered unto them, although it is evident from the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration itſelf, that this payment was conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the defendant, as a condition prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his receiving the authority in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor is there any proof to ſupply the want of this eſſential averment.</p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. Another very material and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential part of the defendant's declaration is not only without proof, but the teſtimony and finding of the jury completely and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely diſprove it. The declaration ſtates, that the defendant requeſted us <q>to elect to receive the amount of the notes, or, at our option, ſo much as would be due to him, after deducting and reſerving <hi>thereout</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſums at Havre, or at any other port in Europe, where the ſhip ſhould diſcharge, <hi>out of the proceeds</hi> of the property; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>ſuch</hi> deduction and reſervation <hi>made,</hi> to give to him power and authority to receive from the purchaſers, the reſidue of the ſaid notes out of the proceeds.</q> It might be inferred from this, that no authority to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the reſidue was required until after this election was made, and Gomez, Lopez and Rivera had actually paid to us, or to our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, the monies which were to be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted and reſerved. The correſpondence between the parties, all the propoſals of Mr.
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:034220_0117_0FFECB9FC2E34200"/>
LeGuen, the finding of the jury, and the ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral times of making his demands of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in queſtion, evidently ſhew, that the reſervation to be made was not out of the proceeds when actually paid to our agent, but that this ſum, which by the bye was nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er aſcertained between the parties, was to be left in the hands of the purchaſers, ſubject to our order.</p>
            <p>Mr. LeGuen's firſt requeſt is to <q>have an authorization to receive in France, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of the engagements of the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,</q> without any reſervation whatever to the plaintiffs. He next demands an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticated copy of the contract, with an authority to receive, after payment of the freight, <hi>one hundred thouſand dollars.</hi> It would have been fortunate for all parties, if the property had produced only half of this ſum. He laſtly demands an <hi>authenticated copy</hi> of the contract, with a complete authorization to receive whatever ſum <hi>ſhall remain of the proceeds of the goods</hi> (not of the <hi>amount of the notes,</hi> as artfully ſtated in the declaration, and from which the proofs ſo eſſentially va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) ſold to Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, after deducting and reſerving at our diſpoſal cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſums for our indemnification; nor is there any proof in the whole verdict, that he ever requeſted us to make the election which he ſtated in his declaration; although it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly appears, that the election to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the proceeds in Europe was made by us, and, for any thing that is found to the contrary, with effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="unknown:034220_0118_0FFECBA148186728"/>
Again—The time of making the requeſt explains the ideas of Mr. LeGuen. The laſt demand was only <hi>fifteen</hi> days after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the White Fox. How could we make the election in ſo ſhort a time, before it was poſſible it could be known where the property would be ſold? Were we to ſend to every port of Europe? It is plain then, that inſtead of our making an election purſuant to the right reſerved to us, the defendant want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an authority and the contract, to purſue the purchaſers and get the whole of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty from them. This appears farther, from the pains he has taken to eſtabliſh on record the cuſtoms of Normandy. It is difficult to ſee any connection between theſe cuſtoms and a power to receive the proceeds. It was the property he was in purſuit of, and not a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the proceeds. There is a material variance too between his declaration and his letter of the 15th June. In the former he ſays, he aſked for an authority to receive <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> from Gomez, Lopez and Rivera; but in his letter he artfully demands a power to receive at the <hi>port of diſcharge,</hi> without ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from whom; this variance we deem eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and fatal. The court below were inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in the admiſſion of teſtimony. The defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant was permitted to prove the cuſtoms of Normandy, with a view no doubt of inducing the jury to believe he had been injured by not receiving the authority demanded, and yet we were not permitted to ſhew any thing in mitigation. If the rule be juſt, that we <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> the very inſtant the default if any took place, put ourſelves into the ſhoes of the purchaſers, without the poſſibility of protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:034220_0119_0FFECBA2D6899F70"/>
ourſelves againſt ſuch an enormous pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and that the price of the article was the <hi>only</hi> rule of damage, the court ſhould have excluded this teſtimony altogether.</p>
            <p>The court rejected the teſtimony offered on our part, that no damage had been ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, on the ground, that the law in this caſe having fixed the amount of the dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to a <hi>preciſe definite ſum,</hi> it could be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor leſs; it was therefore improp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to receive evidence to ſhew that a leſs, or any <hi>particular damage</hi> was ſuſtained. They admitted this evidence on the part of the plaintiff, to ſhew that he had ſuſtained par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular damage, and refuſed it to the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. The court have therefore certainly been in an error in admitting one, or refuſing the other.</p>
            <p>It is true the cuſtom of Normandy makes conſiderably in our favor, as it diſcovers the defendant's true object, and the injury he contemplated doing to us, by taking the whole property under the pretence of a lien, into his own hands. We have a right how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to complain of its admiſſion, as being directly contrary to the rule which the court inforced with reſpect to us. If circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of aggravation were admitted on the one ſide, ſurely matters in mitigation ought to have been received on the other.</p>
            <p n="28">XXVIII. That the rule of damage was er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous may be further illuſtrated from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are brought on contracts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining penalties. If it be an action of debt
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:034220_0120_0FFECBA4E4482988"/>
for the penalty, it might be ſaid the party has aſcertained the ſum he is to pay for the breach of his contract, and that every other rule is <hi>uncertain.</hi> Yet every one knows that the <hi>actual damage</hi> ſuſtained is all the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff can eventually recover, and that this muſt be aſcertained by a jury. Let us ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit as ſtrong a caſe as can be put for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant—Suppoſe Gouverneur and Kemble immediately after making the ſale to Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, had covenanted under the penalty of fifty thouſand pounds to give him, in the courſe of a week, authority to receive the proceeds in Europe, and that they had no demand whatever againſt him. They however refuſe, without aſſigning any reaſon whatever, to give ſuch authority. In an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of debt for the penalty, or in an action of covenant, the penalty would be diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the rule of damage would be the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury actually</hi> ſuſtained—that is the amount of the proceeds with intereſt. Shall they then be in a worſe ſituation becauſe they did not comply with an implied promiſe, and refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give an authority in a caſe where, to ſay the leaſt, it was doubtful whether the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant was entitled to receive one, and where they aſſigned at leaſt a plauſible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for their refuſal, and could certainly not have complied, without very eminent hazard to themſelves?</p>
            <p n="29">XXIX. The finding of the jury, as it reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects the damages, is illegal, and therefore the judgment ought to be reverſed. Inſtead of aſſeſſing them as cuſtomary, they refer it to the court whether the contract price ſhall
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:034220_0121_0FFECBA6F1DE1D00"/>
be the rule. If the court be of <hi>that</hi> opinion, then they find ſuch a ſum. While attaints were in force, ſuch a verdict would not have been permitted, as the party muſt have been deprived of his remedy againſt them for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive damages—for no attaint would lie on a verdict, where the quantum of damage, as well as the law, were referred to the court. It is a dangerous innovation on eſtabliſhed precedents—aſſeſſing damages is emphatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the duty of jurors. Referring it in this way to the court, if not a violation of truſt, is deſtroying thoſe barriers between the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of courts and juries, in the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, ſeparate and diſtinct, conſiſts the great excellence of this mode of trial.— This is at once ſurrendering their prerogatives in which the party has an intereſt not to be defeated by puſillanimity, or a miſtaken de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference for the opinion of others. They are to enquire what injury the party has ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not to leave the <hi>quantum</hi> to be determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the court. If jurors are thus permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to evade adjuſting the very object for which they are convened, their attendance may as well be diſpenſed with altogether, as an uſeleſs expence, and queſtions of <hi>damages</hi> as well as of law be at once ſubmitted to the court. If this honorable court ſhall think the defendant entitled to recover, but that the jury have neglected, from a diffidence in their own judgment, to exerciſe that diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſpecting the damages, with which they are peculiarly intruſted, they may, and no doubt will, order a <hi>venire facias de novo</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to admit further light, and to have the
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:034220_0122_0FFECBA901101458"/>
queſtion of damage definitively ſettled by the proper tribunal. It is much however in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of the plaintiffs that the jury have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed no opinion <hi>againſt</hi> them either as to their liability, or to its extent. It would have been impoſſible to induce a jury of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to ſubſcribe to ſo dangerous a doctrine. It is a matter of public notoriety, and ought to be mentioned, that the firſt jury who were ſelected, from the moſt reſpectable merchants in the community, determined, that Meſſrs. Gouverneur and Kemble had incurred no <hi>reſponſibility whatever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly. The judgment ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, becauſe it is an attempt to puniſh the plaintiffs for the inſolvency of the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, without a particle of proof that they have in any degree contributed to ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvency. Although their failure is not ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the record, it may fairly be inferred from the defendant's conduct. Why look to the plaintiffs for the <hi>contract price</hi> of the cotton and indigo, and that in ſo <hi>queſtionable</hi> a form of action, if the purchaſers were <hi>able</hi> and <hi>liable</hi> to pay? An action on their notes would be more certain and expeditious. The buyers muſt then be either unable to pay, or have good reaſons for reſiſting payment. If their bankruptcy cannot be attributed to the plaintiffs, why ſhould they become their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes? If the buyers have a defence, we ought in no event to be anſwerable for any part. The defendant's motive to this ſuit alſo appears from the time of its being bro't. If he really intended to recover <hi>damages</hi> for the <hi>actual injury</hi> ſuſtained by our default,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:034220_0123_0FFECBAA9871D000"/>
why not immediately abandon to us the whole property, and commence the action without delay? Inſtead of this he waits more than a year to diſcover how the ſpeculation would terminate. If the iſſue had been proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous, and the buyers had ſtood their ground, no recourſe would have been had to us; and yet our liability and its extent were preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame, whether the purchaſers were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pay or not. It was a liability for the <hi>"diſaſtrous conſequences,"</hi> as the defendant himſelf well expreſſes it, <hi>occaſioned</hi> by our default, not a liability to pay the <hi>amount</hi> of the notes. This prepoſterous notion never occurred to him. Let him point out a <hi>ſingle diſaſtrous conſequence</hi> occaſioned by us, and we will compenſate him an hundred ſold.</p>
            <p>After all that will or can be ſaid on the ſubject, into what narrow limits may its real merits be compriſed? It is a diſpute between a principal and his factors—The former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of not being furniſhed with a power to receive the <hi>proceeds of certain property in Europe,</hi> or in other words certain monies.— The factors ſay: <q>We have a lien on <hi>all</hi> your papers and on the price of your goods for our advances and reſponſibilities. This lien the law gave us the moment the ſale was made—as they are very conſiderable we only aſk you to <hi>ſecure</hi> us in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and you ſhall have every thing you want.</q> This lien is not a chimera of the factors own brain. The principal himſelf admits it, but inſiſts, that as the property was to be paid for in Europe, <hi>as far as the proceeds extended,</hi> the factors were bound to
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:034220_0124_0FFECBADBAF32FC0"/>
take payment there alſo, and to look to a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe proceeds, in the hands of the purchaſers, for their indemnification. In ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this perfectly novel idea of a <hi>qualified</hi> lien, the court are apprized that not a ſingle authority from any book will be produced. The principal's counſel will rely upon nice and ſubtle diſtinctions, which ſplendid talents will readily ſuggeſt, and upon a train of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning ſo refined as to require faculties, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to their own, to be able fully to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. The factors, in oppoſition to ſuch a <hi>limited</hi> lien, aſſert, <q>That it is of no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to them, upon what terms the principal ſold his property, or where it was to be paid for. That the rights of factors are <hi>clearly</hi> defined by law—that they nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er before heard, that ſome factors had one kind of lien—and others, a different one, or that the liens of factors vary according to the contract between them and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers—but granting, ſay they, that our lien was thus reſtricted, and that we were bound to go to Europe for payment, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt we had a right to keep the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty under our controul, until actual ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in that country, and not to look on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a remnant of it, which might be waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the purchaſers, or wreſted from them by the principal himſelf—If neither hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and the buyers by misfortunes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inſolvent, our ſecurity will be much impaired, as in ſuch caſe our dividend on their eſtate would not pay our demand.</q>
            </p>
            <p>On the queſtion of damages, the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy is, if poſſible, yet more ſimple. The

principal brings his action for <hi>damages,</hi> or a <hi>compenſation</hi> for an <hi>actual injury,</hi> which he alledges he has <hi>ſuſtained</hi> by <hi>a breach of duty</hi> in his factors. The factors ſay, <q>if we have been guilty of a breach of duty, it has been attended with no <hi>loſs</hi> or <hi>damage what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever</hi> to our employer, and that therefore he is not entitled to any <hi>recompence or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent whatever.</hi>
               </q> The principal, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had ſuſtained no loſs, and of courſe that he could not prove any, abandons the attempt (for his counſel certainly had in view the neceſſity of proving ſpecial dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, when they drew the declaration) and inſiſts upon our paying the whole ſum which the purchaſers had contracted to give. The factors, to this extravagant pretenſion, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this plain anſwer. <q>If, ſay they, we er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in not giving you an authority to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe proceeds, ſurely <hi>their</hi> amount with intereſt, can be all which you are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to from us. It matters not where your money was to be paid; if we were engaged by bond to pay you a certain ſum on the royal exchange of London, and we fail, you can only, if you ſue us in Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica, make us pay the ſame amount with intereſt here. Why then did you not ſhew the amount of theſe proceeds? this would have been eaſy. One of the purchaſers, and the very perſon who ſold the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Europe, was attending the trial. Nay, why did you not permit us to ſhew their amount? What poſſible reaſon can be aſſigned for your ſolicitude to keep out of view theſe proceeds, other than that they were ſo <hi>inconſiderable,</hi> that you wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:034220_0126_0FFECBB0D4218C98"/>
the court and jury to be kept in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them? For aught that appears on record, the property never was ſold in Europe; if ſo, how are you injured? Why ſhould we take the place of the buyers? Did we guarantee their reſponſibility? Did you not ſell the property to them yourſelves? If they have failed, who occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned their bankruptcy? Was it not bro't upon them by the extravagant price they were to give for theſe articles? If they have been ruined by no agency on our part, why are we to make good their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements? Shew us that any <hi>loſs whatev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> has been occaſioned by us, and you ſhall be compenſated to the utmoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</q> Is not this the language of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe?—Is there any ſophiſtry in it?— Does it require eminent abilities or any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity to illuſtrate or to comprehend it?— Does it not accord with every caſe that has been cited on the ſubject of damages, and does it not conſiſt with reaſon and juſtice? Is not the adverſe doctrine pregnant with ruin to every agent, and miſchievous in the extreme?</p>
            <p>To conclude. The court perceive they are to determine on a caſe of no common magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. They muſt by this time be ſatisfied, that it is not without reaſon the plaintiffs conſider themſelves aggrieved, by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from which they have appealed. In this honorable court they have no doubt the cauſe <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> principles of law and juſtice. The law ought to be very <hi>clear indeed</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="unknown:034220_0127_0FFECBB266417500"/>
with the defendant, to induce an affirmance of this judgment. If it be a caſe which admits of a <hi>ſingle doubt,</hi> the judgment ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, becauſe the defendant will ſuffer no injury by it, inaſmuch as he will remain in <hi>ſtatu quo,</hi> without any of his remedies againſt the purchaſers being impaired. From them he will receive what he ought to have; whereas an injury, extenſive and irreparable, will be done to the plaintiffs, in caſe of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmance. They will have to pay an immenſe ſum which has never come to their hands, and for which they have a remedy againſt <hi>no one.</hi> But if the law be clearly againſt them, they muſt ſubmit. They appeal, however, with great confidence, to every profeſſional gentleman preſent, whether they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced any thing not warranted by the laws of their country. They appeal, with equal boldneſs, to every member who may have been engaged in commercial purſuits, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their conduct has not been ſtrictly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile and conſonant to the known and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed cuſtoms of trade. They appeal to every man of candor, probity and feeling, whether, if they have erred, they deſerve to have this heavy fine inflicted on them? They cannot yet believe they are to be conſigned to poverty and ruin; that an ample patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the produce of many years of honeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, is to paſs from them to the defendant, to compenſate him for an <hi>ideal injury;</hi> that they are to be puniſhed to the extent of an immenſe fortune, to make good a loſs which the defendant has never ſuſtained. They cannot perſuade themſelves that any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber will think ſuch a ſentence legal or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious.
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:034220_0128_0FFECBB416B6B280"/>
In fine, they look with truſt and confidence to the virtue and underſtanding of this high tribunal, for a deciſion in their favor, and for that redreſs to which they humbly think themſelves entitled by the laws of their country, and the real and ſubſtantial merits of their caſe.</p>
            <p>Caſe on the part of the defendant.<note place="margin">Caſe on the part of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</note> The counſel for Louis LeGuen will urge and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain—</p>
            <p n="1">1. That every contract made by a factor for the ſale of goods is for the benefit of his principal, and forms a contract between the principal and the purchaſer; and that every contract made by a factor for <hi>his own benefit,</hi> with the property of the principal, is a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his duty, and a fraud againſt the principal.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That every factor is bound generally to obey the orders of his principal, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to uſe his endeavors to carry into effect any contract by him made for the benefit of his principal.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That, therefore, if a contract ſhould ſtip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulate an advantage, to depend on an election to be made, that election being itſelf a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege or benefit, is to be exerciſed for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, and is ſubject to his controul and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That in the preſent caſe, the right of election to receive the purchaſe money in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:034220_0129_0FFECBB7F28C9CE0"/>
was a right which G. and K. ought to have exerciſed for the benefit of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, according to his direction and requeſt, eſpecially as he was thereby to <hi>receive a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium or advance of price of five per cent. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to</hi> 6,12032/100 <hi>dollars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That this poſition and inference are the more obvious in the preſent caſe—Becauſe, the factors could neither have ſtipulated nor exerciſed ſuch a right without the conſent of their principal—Becauſe, the contract was made by the <hi>intervention and expreſs direction</hi> of LeGuen—Becauſe, <hi>it was his avowed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to tranſfer his property to France,</hi> of which country he was a native and citizen—Becauſe, at Havre-de-Grace, to which port the ſhip was bound, he would have had a lien on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, which would have enabled him to have taken precautions important to his ſecurity; and, becauſe it is abſurd to ſuppoſe that all theſe advantages could be defeated, at the mere pleaſure of the factors, and in defiance of the direction of the principal.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That the acknowledged lien, which a a factor has on the property entruſted to him, for his advances and reſponſibilities, can form no objection to the demand of LeGuen in the preſent caſe—Becauſe,</p>
            <p>That lien, like every other right, is liable to be modified or aboliſhed, by the agreement of the parties, either expreſs or implied—</p>
            <p>That it is not in its nature local, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends wholly on the place of payment—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="unknown:034220_0130_0FFECBB977995A48"/>
That G. and K. by becoming parties to a contract for the benefit of LeGuen, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a right of election to receive in foreign parts the monies to ariſe from the proceeds, virtually agreed to give effect to this right, and to exerciſe his lien at the place of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—</p>
            <p>That if payment had been poſitively ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated at Havre or Hamburgh, no doubt could have ariſen but that, after reſerving enough to cover their advances and reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities, they would have been obliged to pay the overplus <hi>there</hi> to LeGuen; and in ſuch caſe, to have contended that they would have had a right <hi>to bring back the whole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of the ſales to New-York at his expence and riſk,</hi> to cover themſelves for a ſum which might not amount to one <hi>thouſandth</hi> part of it, would be an abſurdity too glaring to be endured—that a right of election to receive in a foreign port, brings the matter to the ſame iſſue—when that election was made, the Foreign port became the place of payment, and <hi>there</hi> only could the lien of the factors be exerciſed.</p>
            <p>That it is an invariable maxim in law, that he who agrees to an <hi>end</hi> agrees to the MEANS. G. and K. might have refuſed to enter into the contract on ſuch terms, but having aſſented, having executed the contract, they were bound not to impede the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it.</p>
            <p>That G. and K. could have given the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority required of them by LeGuen, in ſo
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:034220_0131_0FFECBBB06045C08"/>
ſpecial a form and with ſuch co-operation of an agent named by themſelves, as would have ſecured to them the full benefit of their <hi>lien,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And laſtly, it will be demonſtrated that <hi>upon the conſtruction contended for by G. and K. they and their agents may keep the whole property in their hands forever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With reſpect to the meaſure and amount of damages, for the reſpondent, it will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the rules of law preſcribe the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of damages in all caſes in which they are not merely contingent—Thus in promiſſory notes and other liquidated demands, the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal intereſt—on foreign bills 20 per cent— on inland bills 5 per cent; without any enquiry into the ſpecial damage which the party may have actually ſuſtained. Thus in actions of trover, however ſlight the damage, the party is compelled to pay the whole value of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of which he hath made an improper uſe. Thus, finally, in every caſe of a factor or truſtee, the damages are invariably the whole value of the property which may have been affected by his neglect or miſconduct; as in a caſe of acknowledged authority, if a factor be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to ſell at a credit of thirty days, and he ſell at a credit of thirty-one, <hi>he is inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liable for the value of the whole,</hi> although the purchaſer prove inſolvent within the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days; becauſe a violation of his duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating <hi>to the whole.</hi> If he had ſold <hi>a part</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he would in like manner have been lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for <hi>that part.</hi> So if a truſtee be directed
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:034220_0132_0FFEC1C89CAA7870"/>
to put out money on real property, and lend it on perſonal ſecurity, however competent, be is inſtantly anſwerable perſonally for the whole. No enquiry is made or would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as to the actual or probable damage ſuſtained; the factor and the truſtee are deemed to have taken the reſponſibility up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the application of this obvious principle is peculiarly neceſſary in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe, becauſe of the impoſſibility of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaining or calculating the events which may have affected the views and intereſt of the parties; that if LeGuen ſhould prove on the one part that he could have made half a million of dollars by the receipt of his money in Havre, and by his preſence in aiding the ſales, could have alſo enſured a profit to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mez and Co. and G. and K. on the other part ſhould prove, that they had reaſon to believe that a better market could be had at Hamburgh—a court ought to pronounce, as has been done by the ſupreme court, that all ſuch <hi>proof</hi> would be irrelevant, and could tend only to introduce confuſion and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; the only object of enquiry being, have G. and K. neglected or diſobeyed the orders of their principal? If ſo, does their neglect or miſconduct relate to the whole or a part only of the property; if to the whole, they are liable for the whole—if to a part, for that part only. No other evidence was admiſſible to extinguiſh or mitigate the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, but that the price in the ſale was fraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulent—that the property had been loſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the default—that the principal had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:034220_0133_0FFECBBF2CEA1F88"/>
the whole or part, or had been wholly or partially compenſated; <hi>neither of which points was in any ſort attempted to be proved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That a default, which gives a right of action, neceſſarily carries with it the rule of compenſation or damages, as an incident, and which cannot therefore in any degree depend on future events and contingencies.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That as the default in the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance related to the whole property, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the eſſential part of the ſale, G. and K. thereby ſubſtituted themſelves to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers, and took upon themſelves the riſk of future contingencies: That the amount for which the property ſold is the proper and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtandard of value and of damages; and that on any other principle there could be <hi>no rule</hi> of damage in the preſent caſe; the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents which took place ſubſequently to the default offering only a field for vague and unlimited conjecture.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That in the caſes mentioned under the firſt head, and in many others, the law fixes the rule of damages, which will regulate and control the verdict of a jury—That when the parties agree the value, this value is the rule—That where an agent, by his aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or default puts himſelf in the place of another, with whom he has ſettled the value, the value ſo ſettled ſhall govern as againſt him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That conſequently the amount for which the goods were ſold to Gomez, Lopez and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vera,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:034220_0134_0FFECBC0CE33D570"/>
together with five per cent. for receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Europe, is the <hi>principal ſum</hi> for which G. and K. became liable, for their default.</p>
            <p>The foregoing general propoſitions will be illuſtrated by arguments and analogies, which it is hoped will fully evince their ſoundneſs, and the propriety of the judgment of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme court.</p>
            <p>The objections in point of form, with which G. and K. may attempt to embarraſs the cauſe, would not be worthy of notice in this ſtate of the buſineſs, even if they could, be anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. They will, without difficulty, be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of in the couſe of the argument.</p>
