            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004145_0004_1003DCA78F9FD120"/>of the Church has directed to this in his Word, that ſo all things may be done with Decency and Order: But then how widely different is <hi>This</hi> his Government from <hi>That,</hi> which now obtains, and hath long done ſo, in the greateſt part of the Chriſtian Church, which hath long ſince gone off from that mixt Form which our Lord firſt inſtituted, and is degenerated into a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy: I ſay degenerated into it, for that however that kind of Government (when well tempered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated as is the happy Britiſh Monarchy) may ſuit a State; it is evidently unſuitable to the Church of Chriſt; for hence have proceeded, That Popiſh Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, That Error and Superſtition, That Pomp and Vanity which have ſo painted and adulterated the Face of the Chriſtian Church, whereby ſhe hath loſt That <hi>Native</hi> Comlineſs put upon her by God <note n="†" place="bottom">Ezek. 16.14.</note> (with which ſhe ſo charm'd the World in the Days of the Apoſtles) and chang'd it for the <hi>Factitious</hi> Beauty and Gaiety of an Harlot, and therefore is ſo repreſented, by the Holy Ghoſt in the Revelation <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. 17.5.</note> as <hi>the Mother of Harlots, and Abominations of the Earth;</hi> Tho' that Form of Government then, which hath been ſo pernicious to the Church of God, is to be rejected and refus'd, as what hath not proceeded from Chriſt, is no where found in the Scripture, and naturally tends to Idolatry and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition; Yet we are by no means to lay aſide Rule and Government, without which the Church of Chriſt, no more than any other Polity, can ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not here ſpend Time in conſidering the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Forms of Government which are at preſent exiſting in the ſeveral parts of the Chriſtian Church, and to recommend this or the other, for that, we already have a very good Form of Government and Diſcipline, laid down in the Platform of our Churches, which tho' I can by no means think obligatory upon us as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004145_0005_1003DCAC58F78A60"/>becauſe it wants Perfection, yet well deſerves to be highly honour'd and reverenc'd as a ſtrong Guard againſt eccleſiaſtical Tyranny and Oppreſſion, which hath ſo much defac'd the Church of Chriſt, and made it <hi>a Neſt of every unclean Bird.</hi> I have therefore cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to inſiſt upon theſe Words to Day, that I might ſhow if I can, what this Rule is, which is to be exercis'd in the Church of God, and what Obedience and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is to be yielded thereto, That you Brethren of this Church of Chriſt may chearfully pay ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and Regard to that Rule which our Lord hath ſet up in his Church, as that the Servant of God now to be ſet over you in the Lord, may be able to render his Account of you to his Maſter, with Joy and not with Grief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obey Them that have the Rule over you and ſubmit yourſelves, for They watch for your Souls as They that muſt give an Account: that They may do it with Joy and not with Grief: for this is unprofitable for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jealouſies and Suſpicions of the Church of Chriſt, concerning the Rule and Government aſſumed over them, by their Guides, have riſen to ſuch a height, and I confeſs with regard to the Chriſtian Church in general they have had Reaſon eno' for it, tho' as to ourſelves I think there is little need, becauſe our Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment is in that reſpect low enough: But I ſay in conſideration of the Rule and Power aſſum'd in the Chriſtian Church in general by their Governours, there has been ſuch a Jealouſy, that having read theſe Words it will be neceſſary to look into the Original, to conſider the juſt Import of the Terms uſed in our Text, that we may more exactly know our Duty in this Regard, for that there are many Words in all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages that cannot (eſpecially if they be of various im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) be truly rendered into any Other, by one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

            <p n="2">2. <hi>What is the Rule and Authority to be exercis'd by them, which the Flock is to Obey and Submit to.</hi> This Head then muſt be well conſider'd by us, for We mean not to plead for any of that Rule and Authority, which thro' the Apoſtacy of the Church of Chriſt from the Rules and Directions of the Goſpel, has ſo long ago ſecretly and by Degrees crept into the Adminiſtrations of it, till at laſt it roſe to ſuch an enormous height, as to caſt down the Thrones, Principalities and Powers of this World: And tho' by the Grace and Favour of God to the World it is much weakned, yet it ſtill retains a ſtrong uſurpation, not only over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, but alſo over the temporal Concerns and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of Men. I ſhall therefore ſpeak to this Head Negatively and Poſitively.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively.</hi> I ſhall ſhew <hi>what is not the Rule and Authority that belongs to the Paſtors of the Churches of Chriſt,</hi> in theſe two Things.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Such have no Right to uſe Force and Compulſion with their People in Spirituals.</hi> In whatſoever Churches of Chriſt there is made uſe of External Force and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion in theſe Regards, ſo far they are gone off from the Simplicity that is in Chriſt. If indeed by external Force and Compulſion we cou'd perſwade Men to think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than they do, doubtleſs theſe would be very proper Engines to promote Religion in the Hearts of Men. The external Affairs of Men in Civil Societies and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities are carried on by overt Acts, and therefore the Laws enacted in theſe Regards have reſpect to thoſe Methods whereby they may be controul'd in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Actions: And in theſe Reſpects therefore cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Puniſhments and Sanctions, which have their Influence upon their Bodies, are found by Experience to be very proper, becauſe often effectual, but inaſmuch as Religion, which it is the profeſs'd Deſign of Miniſters
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004145_0010_1003DCDB79DD7618"/>of the Goſpel to promote and encourage among Men, hath its Foundation in, and depends upon, the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Soul and Mind, ſo external Force hath nothing to do with it; hereby indeed Men may be forc'd to ſpeak and act, according to the Influence of ſuch exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Puniſhments, but if they ſtill think otherwiſe it only makes Hypocrites of them, and then inſtead of promoting Religion we have only forc'd them to act againſt their Conſciences, which is the greateſt Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the Advancement of the Kingdom of Chriſt, and therefore the Miniſters or Paſtors of his Churches ſhould have no Hand in making any Laws with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Spiritual Affairs of their People, by which to bind their Conſciences in Matters of Religion: Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath already given us theſe his Laws in his Goſpel, which are all of them of a Spiritual Nature, and therefore no Man whatſoever, nor any Number or Body of Men, have or can have any Right to make Laws for the Regulation of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Concerns of Men in the World. <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>"A Divine Precept is neceſſary to warrant every part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worſhip.

All Inſtructions derive their Authority either from God or the Creature: If it be from God, then He hath ſignified his Mind about it in Scripture, and that in particular; for He hath no where by any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Indulgence given away this Liberty of His to any other Authority in the World, to have the Dominion of the Conſciences of Men, or to give Rules of Worſhip, but hath ſtrongly prohibited it, and ſeverely threatned any that ſhall preſume to do it.</p>

               </note>
And this is evident becauſe Chriſt's Kingdom in this World is a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004145_0011_1003DCDD692B5A38"/>Spiritual Kingdom, and ſuch Laws pretend to regulate the Hearts and Affections of Men, and Our Lord hath in this Affair conſtituted no [humane] Authority, to make any Addition to his Laws, which are full and compleat, as He hath deliver'd them unto us. <hi>He</hi> that knew the Heart, <hi>knew all that was in Man,</hi> and therefore was able to give him a compleat Law. As to Men indeed, thro' the imperfection of their Wiſdom, and their Ignorance of the humane Nature, and how the Luſts and Paſſions of Men will vary the Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Things, they are often forced to make <hi>an Act in Addition to an Act,</hi> but it is not ſo with our great Lawgiver, but as his Laws are all the Reſult of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom, ſo there is no need to add to them or diminiſh from them.</p>
            <p>Indeed as to theſe Laws and Rules, proper to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Churches, conſider'd as Civil Societies, whereby the Prudentials of their temporal Concerns, are to be conducted and concluded, here the Miniſters of the Goſpel, together with the Aſſiſtance and Conſent of their People and Flock, may doubtleſs make ſuch Rules and Orders as beſt ſuit them in theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: But as to all thoſe Laws that have any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Soul and Conſcience, to Men in Spirituals, they are to be look'd for in the Goſpel. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo we are to look there for the Sanctions of His Laws, and thoſe Rewards and Puniſhments, whereby He deſigns to promote His Kingdom in the Hearts of Men, and theſe are, the Promiſes <hi>of Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory,</hi> in the Preſence of God, upon our Obedience, and the Threatnings of <hi>Eternal Miſery and Sorrow</hi> upon our Diſobedience, in a Word, the Loſs of the Favour of God, and ſuffering his Wrath and Indignation; theſe are the only Sanctions which our Lord has given to his Laws, and theſe may not be alter'd by Men, may not be added to, neither by People nor by Miniſters
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004145_0012_1003DCE7DEF59D08"/>and thoſe that have the higheſt Authority in his Church. And therefore, as I ſaid before, temporal Rewards and Puniſhments have nothing to do in Religion, becauſe they are ſuch as the great Head of the Church hath not propos'd we ſhould be influenc'd by, for that they have no tendency to perſwade the Mind: It is the Heart which God looks at in all Religious Actions, that if we worſhip him it ſhould be in Sincerity and Truth, but there is nothing of this tendency either in the Rewards of this World, or in external Force. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Racks and Tortures, have no tendency to convince the Conſcience. Worldly Glories and Rewards are far from tending to raiſe the Heart and Affections to heavenly Things, which is the <hi>Peculiar</hi> in true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But if we conſider the terrors of the Wrath of God threatned to Sinners, and the exceeding Weight of Glory promis'd to the Servants of Chriſt, here we have the ſtrongeſt Topics of Perſuaſion, and ſuch as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more weighty, than all the Arguments we can form from any worldly Conſiderations; and which is beyond all, ſuch as we have hope, the Spirit of God will co-operate with, upon the Minds and Conſciences of Men.</p>
            <p>But as this external Force and Compulſion which has been ſo much us'd in the Chriſtian Church, has origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from a Spirit of Bigotry and a Servile Regard to the falſe gloſſes and miſinterpretation of the Laws of the Goſpel, by ſuch as have aſſum'd a Tyrannical Eccleſiaſtical Authority, Therefore I ſay further, that the Miniſters of the Goſpel have no Right to impoſe their Interpretations of the Laws of Chriſt upon their Flocks: Every Man is oblig'd to receive the Laws of Chriſt, and to yield Obedience to them in that Senſe in which he underſtands them, and when we oblige them to yield Obedience to thoſe Laws, in the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Senſe in which we underſtand them, it is in Fact making another Law for them; every Man therefore
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004145_0013_1003B9509231A760"/>is to judge for himſelf in theſe Things, and to have no Impoſition made upon his Conſcience in Spirituals, for this is to uſurp that Dominion which our Lord hath reſerv'd to himſelf. It is true, it is much of the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, as they are Teachers, to inſtruct their Flocks in the Mind of Chriſt, as they themſelves underſtand it, (which part of their Office I ſhall preſently ſpeak of) but this is quite another Thing from impoſing their Senſe of Matters upon them, and pretending they break the Law of Chriſt if they do not think in theſe Regards as they do: For as every Man is to anſwer for himſelf, as to the Regard he hath had to the Laws of Chriſt, ſo he cannot be guiltleſs, tho' he act agreable to the Sentiments of the greateſt Men upon Earth, if thereby he contradicts his own Light, Reaſon and Conſcience in that Affair. This ſhall ſuffice for the Negative Conſideration of that Rule and Authority which is to be exercis'd by the Paſtors of the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the poſitive Conſideration of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To ſhew what that Rule and Authority is, which the Miniſters of the Goſpel have committed to them, to which this Obedience and Submiſſion of their Flocks is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</hi> And here,

1. <hi>The Paſtor is to be conſider'd as the Teacher and Inſtructor of his Flock, and all that Submiſſion and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience render'd to him, that is proper in that Quality.</hi> I ſhall not ſpend Time here to prove that this is his Duty, becauſe it will be readily acknowledged, to be a principal Part of his Work, that is to take up a great Part of his Time and Talents among them: To teach them the Principles of Religion, to warn them of the various Errors in Doctrine which they are to be aware of, and to feed them with Spiritual Knowledge, of which alſo I ſhall ſay more hereafter: It is evident then that he that teaches and inſtructs, muſt in that Regard (tho' in others inferior) have a priority to him that is taught and inſtructed. I am aware that Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is us'd in Contradiſtinction to Rule and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but yet it is nevertheleſs certain, that the Right to teach and inſtruct implies an Obligation upon the Diſciple to receive and obey the Inſtruction, and I rather ſay this becauſe the Word in our Text tranſlated, <hi>RULE over you,</hi> may be (as I have ſaid) otherwiſe render'd, them that <hi>Guide</hi> you, that is that Guide you in the way of the Chriſtian Life, that is (no doubt) by Teaching and Inſtruction: Such then as Teach, Lead and Guide, muſt have ſome Rule over thoſe that are taught, led and guided by them. The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which is paid to any as a Teacher, certainly cannot be leſs than to receive his Doctrine, in ſuch manner as to think our ſelves obliged to behave our ſelves agreable to the Information, we ſo receive from him; that is, as we conſider him, giving his Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, agreable to that Rule of Faith and Manners, which we enjoy from God: For by no means are we to regard him, however great his Name is and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Veneration we have for him, yet are we by no means to regard any of his Inſtructions, farther than they are agreable to the Word of God: If any of the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004145_0015_1003DD08B95811A8"/>corrupt Parts of the Chriſtian Church, think they have any other Rule of Faith beſides the Scriptures, yet to us who are of the <hi>Proteſtant Communion,</hi> the Scripture is confeſſedly our only Rule in theſe Things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are to regard nothing, reſpecting either Faith or Manners, which your Paſtors teach you, if it at all digreſs from that unerring Rule.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Paſtors of the Churches of Chriſt are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd as having Authority to rebuke and reprove, and ſo is Obedience and Submiſſion to be yielded to them.</hi> If then they have Authority to teach and inſtruct, in what way they are to walk, certainly when they err from that way, they are to reſtrain them, to be check upon them, and rebuke them for their Wandrings; and the Apoſtle directs <hi>Titus,</hi> 1 <hi>Ch.</hi> 13. <hi>to rebuke them and that ſharply if need be, that they might be ſound in the Faith.</hi> This Work of the Paſtor then implies Rule and Authority, for as we bring you no Leſſons or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, or at leaſt ought not to bring you any other, than what we receive from the Word of God, ſo have we the ſame Word as the Foundation of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs and Remonſtrances againſt any of your Actions, as they are oppoſite or contradictory to that great Rule: Therefore when we rebuke and reprove, we aſk not your Regard, your Obedience and Submiſſion, unleſs we prove by that Word, that you have done as ye ought not to have done; but when we do this, we demand your Attention, you are to reverence ſuch Reproofs as what the Word of God hath commanded, and authoriz'd us to lay before you: If you ſay, that this is an Obedience and Submiſſion to the Word of God, but not to your Paſtors, Be it ſo, We aſk no more than that Regard which will neceſſarily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Doctrines and Inſtructions, Reproofs and Remonſtrances of the Goſpel, conſcientiouſly receiv'd by you. Juſt as the Caſe is in the Civil Government,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004145_0016_1003DD111C123BC8"/>we are to obey ſuch as have magiſtratical Rule and Power over us, but how do we render Obedience to them, and what is it? Not as they are private Perſons, but our Obedience is to the Law of which they are the Miniſters: But then when we receive the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the Law from them, being in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their Office, as they are <hi>Miniſters of God to us for Good,</hi> we according to the importance of their Poſts give them Reverence and Eſteem, and ſubmit to the Authoritative Sentence as it is by them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd upon us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Paſtors of the Church of Chriſt are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd as having Authority to call the Church together, to order their Proceedings, and to diſmiſs them; and in this Regard is Obedience and Submiſſion to be render'd to them.</hi> Hence we have that, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>Then the Twelve called the Multitude of the Diſciples unto them.</hi> And hence it is that our Platform tells us <note n="*" place="bottom">Platf. Ch. Diſcip. Ch. 10. S. 8.</note>, <q>
                  <hi>That as Chriſt has committed Power to the Elders, to Feed and Rule the Church of God, ſo they are accordingly to call the Church together, upon any weighty Occaſions, and when they bave done ſo, the Members ſo called, may not without juſt Cauſe refuſe to come, nor when they are come, may they depart, before they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd, nor ſpeak in the Church before they have Leave from the Elders, nor may they continue doing ſo when they require Silence, nor may they oppoſe nor contradict the Judgment and Sentence of the Elders, without ſufficient and weighty Cauſe, becauſe ſuch Practices are manifeſtly contrary unto Order and Government, and Inlets of Diſturbances, and tend to Confuſion.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Paſtor of the Church is to be conſidered as the firſt Officer in the Church, by whom the judicial Sentence
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004145_0017_1003DD1949C4ABE0"/>is to be pronounced in all the Cenſures of the Church, either in public Admonitions, or Excommunication, and as ſuch he is to have Obedience and Submiſſion paid unto him.</hi> Tho' it is, and always ought to be, according to the Mind and Conſent of the Church, with the Concurrence of their Elders or Paſtors, yet the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of the Sentence is his Right; which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſpeaks the Dignity and Superiority of his Station in the Church: Hence alſo in Civil Judicatories, the Sentence is always pronounc'd by the Chief Judge or moſt honourable among them.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Things laid together, we may ſee, what kind of Rule and Government, the Paſtor is to exerciſe over his Flock, and what Submiſſion is to be render'd unto him. He hath no Right to uſe any external Force, if it were in his Power, nor is he by any Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he may have, ever to endeavour to move the Civil Magiſtrate to do it: He is by no means to influence or govern his Church, in their Spirituals, by any other Laws than Chriſt has laid down in his Goſpel, whoſe Force wholly depends upon Spiritual Sanctions, or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments and Rewards that are properly Spiritual: He hath no Right to impoſe his Interpretations of the Goſpel, upon his Flock, but when he hath inlightned them by his Teaching and Inſtruction as much as is in his Power, they muſt ſtill be left to judge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to act according to their own Conſciences, ſo that all coercive Power is to be diſclaim'd by the Paſtors of the Churches of Chriſt: All the Force they are to uſe lies in rational Arguments, convincing the Minds of their Flock ſtrongly, and inlightning them with Knowledge, whereby they may plainly ſee the Way, that they wander not from the Path of Life through any Darkneſs of Error and Superſtition. But if they do wander, that they reſtrain, by rebuking and reproving them, and that ſharply if need be. Thus
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004145_0018_1003DD241813DD38"/>Brethren, you ſee what kind of Power and Rule we claim as your Paſtors; Not ſuch as is us'd in the Corruptions of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> whoſe Strength lies in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Force, not the Power of the ſecular Arm, which indeed is abſolutely neceſſary to the Support of their Hierarchical Pride and Tyranny: We deſire <hi>not to have Dominton over your Faith,</hi> nor to <hi>Lord it over the Heritage of God,</hi> acknowledging the Neceſſity of your conſent and compliance with all our Acts of Church-Cenſure and Diſcipline; Only we expect, that as the Holy Ghoſt hath ſet us in the Church, to teach and inſtruct, to rebuke and reprove, to regulate the Order and Proceedings of your Conſultations as a Church, and pronounce in a ſolemn Manner thoſe Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, which you, in conjunction with us, have agreed to the Execution of, that you render that Obedience and Submiſſion which our Text here demands of you: For certainly in this, as the Apoſtle ſays, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>We ſtretch not our ſelves beyond our Meaſure;</hi> and therefore, we alſo ſay with him in the 8. <hi>v.</hi> of that Chap. <hi>Tho' we boaſt ſomewhat of our Authority which the Lord hath given us, for Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and not for your Deſtruction, we are not aſhamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I finiſh the Conſideration of the firſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Head I obſerv'd in the Words, <hi>viz.</hi> A Duty injoyn'd, <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit yourſelves.</hi> I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. To conſider the Reaſons of it, or the Argument us'd to inforce it, in theſe Words, <hi>For they watch for your Souls, as they that muſt give Account, that they may do it with Joy, and not with Grief: for this is unprofitable for you.</hi> Which Argument will lie plainer before us, if we thus tranſpoſe the Words, <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit yourſelves, that they may give up their Account of thoſe Souls for which
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004145_0019_1003DD2D7A0CBBA8"/>they watch, with Joy and not with Grief, for this will be unprofitable for you.</hi> So that the Argument here uſed is founded more eſpecially upon the Topic of your own Intereſt and Advantage; he argues not your Obedience to the Inſtructions and Reproofs of your Paſtors, ſo much from their Advantage as your own, in that otherwiſe the Account which they muſt render of you to the great Shepherd, cannot be given up with Joy and Chearfulneſs, but with the greateſt Grief and Sorrow, which will be to your Deſtruction and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.

Our Lord therefore hath given his Paſtors to his Flocks, that they ſhould watch and guard them from all their ſpiritual Enemies; and as the Manner in which the Enemy endeavours to intrap his Prey is various, ſo are they to improve their whole Skill and all their Powers: Some times they are in danger by the riſe of Hereſy, and the growth of Infidelity; theſe then are to be carefully heeded in their firſt Riſe, and the vain ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial pretender to Knowledge that vents his Errors, to be timely, carefully and prudently oppoſed, while the Truth and Excellency and divine Origin of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is rationally evidenc'd to his Flock: But above all, is he to oppoſe the greateſt of all Hereſies, Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Life and Manners, from whence moſt other Hereſies proceed; for Men would never be tempted to ſeek after other Schemes of Religion, and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſtianity, than are plainly delivered to them in the Scriptures, were they not aware, that according to the preſent Syſtem and Doctrines they were not ſafe: But when they have firſt immers'd themſelves in Vice and led an abandon'd Life, and thence ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves liable to Miſery and Ruin, they are tempted to form a Set of Principles agreable to their own Morals,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004145_0021_1003B974DFE2B458"/>that they may get rid of the Fear and Diſtreſs, that muſt incumber their Souls, while they believe the Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Word of God.</p>
            <p>The Paſtor of the Church of Chriſt therefore is to oppoſe Vice and Immorality with all his Force and Powers, and while he is exhorting them to Soundneſs of Doctrine, and to perform thoſe Offices of Religion that relate to the Divine Worſhip, to attend the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ordinances, that he omit not the weightier Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Law, that they behave themſelves with all purity of Manners, in all Temperance and Chaſtity with reſpect to themſelves, with all that Juſtice and Righteouſneſs to others, that Uprightneſs and Sincerity in all their Dealings with Men, the want of which is the Diſgrace and will be the Condemnation of many a zealous external Profeſſor of Religion: The Paſtors therefore are thus to guard their Flocks, to watch and be diligent in theſe Reſpects, that they may prevent the ſpreading of Error, and the increaſe of every kind of Vice and Immorality.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Paſtors of the Churches of Chriſt, as a part of their Watch, are to pray for their Flocks.</hi> After all that we can do, we have no Power to effect any Thing as of ourſelves; we may argue and remonſtrate, and uſe our beſt Endeavours with our Flocks, but we can bring nothing to Effect, without the Aſſiſtance of the great Shepherd; when then we have done all we are able in theſe Regards, we are to carry our Flocks to Chriſt in Prayer, and there implore his Bleſſing upon our Endeavours with them, that He would guard and defend them, that He would pardon and forgive them, that He would give them His Divine Grace to help in Time of Need. Our Powers of Reaſoning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing the Minds of Men may be very great and conſiderable; and we may be able to ſtop the Mouths
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004145_0022_1003DD4E064FCC88"/>of Gainſayers, but yet it is not in our Power to turn them from Darkneſs unto Light; but for the convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace of God, we are to pour out our Soul to him in Prayer, not only with our Flocks in Public, but our Souls ſhould weep in ſecret Places for their Sins, and be importunate for the Divine Grace, on them and on their Children. Theſe are the beſt Guards we can ſet about them, theſe are the <hi>Chariots of Iſrael and the Horſemen thereof,</hi> and more their Defence than all the other Weapons of our Warfare.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Another Part of our Watch for the Souls of our Flocks, is teaching and inſtructing them.</hi> I have before ſpoken ſomething of this part of the Paſtoral Work, as intimating his Authority: I now further ſpeak of the Way and Manner in which theſe his Inſtructions are to be convey'd to his Flock, and ſay, they are to give their Flocks theſe Inſtructions,
<list>
                  <item>1. By their Word and Doctrine.</item>
                  <item>2. By their Life and Manners.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They are teach and inſtruct their People by Word and Doctrine.</hi> As they take their Texts and Topics of Diſcourſe from the holy Scriptures, ſo (as we have already ſaid) they are to be careful to teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their People according to them, and to deliver nothing to them as obligatory upon them, but what is found in thoſe Scriptures, either in expreſs Terms, or rationally deducible therefrom: To chooſe ſuch Heads of Diſcourſe alſo, as are beſt ſuited to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of their People, that they may feed them with Food convenient for them, giving them the Bread which came down from Heaven, that they may be nouriſhed to everlaſting Life; that they moſt of all therefore, inſiſt upon thoſe Doctrines, that tend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more a Life of Faith, that tend to convince them of their own Weakneſs and Impotence, and their abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Need of a Saviour, that they may be fill'd with
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004145_0023_1003DD5B26000AE8"/>Love to God, as <hi>the Light of the Glories of the Divine Nature is manifeſted in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and exhibited in the Doctrines of the Goſpel. With theſe Doctrines is the Preacher to warm the Hearts of his Hearers; they ſhould therefore be deliver'd with Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs and Affection, that while he feels the Energy of them in his own Heart, and ſuch his divine Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings have kindled a Flame in his own Soul, He may be happily inſtrumental of communicating the ſame divine Fervours to others, that their Hearts may alſo glow and <hi>burn within them, while beginning at Moſes and all the Prophets, he expounds to them in all the Scriptures, the Things concerning</hi> Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Paſtors of the Churches of Chriſt are to inſtruct their Flocks <hi>by their Lives and Manners.</hi> It is an old Obſervation, that Examples teach more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than Precepts; and therefore the Life of the Paſtor ſhould exemplify all the Practical Doctrines which he delivers to his People. All the Directions and Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Shepherd will never be able to keep his Flock in the Way, if He himſelf leave the Path. If they are apt to wander from the Path, tho' He himſelf keep right on his Way, how much more will they do ſo, when He ſets them the Example? It is therefore abſolutely neceſſary, that we ſhould be Examples to our Flocks, of all the Moral Duties which we preach unto them; in Temperance, in Humility, in Devotion, in Patience, in Love and Charity: that as far as is poſſible they may ſee the Excellency of the Chriſtian Doctrines exemplified in our Behaviour, that <hi>ſeeing our good Converſation, they may glorify our heavenly Father.</hi> And thus are the Paſtors to watch for the Souls of their Flocks.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Theſe Souls they muſt give an Account of unto Chriſt.</hi> Hence it is that God tells the Prophet, when
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004145_0024_1003DD62E13C6470"/>He had conſtituted him a Watchman, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.8. <hi>If thou doſt not ſpeak, to warn the Wicked from his Way, that wicked Man ſhall die in his Iniquity, but his Blood will I require at thy Hand.</hi> When all Nations ſhall be arraign'd before the great and dreadful Tribunal of God, as every Man muſt then give an Account of his perſonal Actions, ſo alſo of his Duty in the ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations he has ſtood in, to his Fellow-Creatures: When the Books ſhall be open'd, and the great Judge of all the Earth ſhall make Inquiſition for the Blood of Souls, how happy ſhall we be, if then we are able to give up our Account with Joy, and to ſay, each one for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Lord, here am I, and the Children which thou haſt graciouſly given thy Servant!</hi> But on the other Hand, how ſad will be our Condition, if the Guilt of their Blood be found upon us, becauſe they have periſhed, either by our Neglect, or by our evil Doctrines, or by the Influences of our bad Examples!— And thus I finiſh the firſt Head under the Argument us'd in the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Paſtors of the Churches of Chriſt, muſt render their Accounts to him of the Souls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Watch and Care. I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It will be to the infinite Loſs and Miſery of thoſe Souls, of whom they muſt give up their Account with Grief and Sorrow.— That they may give up their Account with Joy and not with Grief, for this is unprofitable for you.</hi> There is certainly a <hi>Meioſis</hi> in the Expreſſion; for the meaning can be nothing leſs than that thoſe Souls, of whom their Paſtors give up this ſorrowful Account, ſhall be the Subjects of the Wrath of God, as threatned in that Goſpel, which they have in vain preached unto them. How many Souls, alas, will periſh, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Labour and Care of their faithful Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors! But of all theſe they will be forc'd to give up their Accounts with Grief and Sorrow, theſe being ſuch as are ſpoken of in the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.9. <hi>If thou
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004145_0025_1003DD6DD2E67C58"/>warn the Wicked of his Way, and he do not turn from it, he ſhall die in his Sins, but thou haſt delivered thy Soul.</hi> But tho' your faithful Paſtors ſhall thus deliver their Souls, yet how great is their Burthen and Sorrow, to ſee ſo many of them loſt in Eternal Perdition! Which leads me to the</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>If you ſubmit not your ſelves to theſe Inſtructions and Warnings of God, which He ſends to you by us, we muſt give up our Accounts with Grief and Sorrow.</hi> Tho' the faithful Paſtor of his Flock will have great Conſolation, when he is able to ſay, according to that in the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.4. <hi>Tho' I have labour'd in vain, and ſpent my Strength for nought and in vain, yet ſurely my Judgment is with the Lord, and my Work with my God:</hi> Yet when their People regard not their Warnings and Inſtructions and Reproofs, with what Sighs, Tears, Sorrow and heavineſs of Heart muſt they be diſtreſs'd, to ſee the Souls of their People loſt! When yet they muſt witneſs againſt you before God, that they have called, but ye refuſed, when they have entreated and exhorted, when they have urged you with Tears, that ye would be reconciled unto God, yet you ſtopped your Ears and refuſed to hearken and return.</p>
            <p>This is the ſad and melancholy Account, which your Paſtors will be forc'd to give up to God, if you obey not nor ſubmit to them, thus watching for your Souls: And hence certainly the Argument concludes very ſtrongly, that you ought to have a reverent Regard to all thoſe Inſtructions and Remonſtrances, that your Paſtors bring you in the Name of Chriſt. <hi>Obey</hi> then <hi>Them that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves: for they watch for your Souls as they that muſt give Account; that they may do it with Joy and not with Grief: for this is unprofitable for you.</hi> I ſhall
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004145_0026_1003DD79681A0590"/>now proceed to the <hi>Application</hi> of what we have heard, in two or three Things.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Hence we learn the Dignity of the Miniſterial Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> The Dignity of any Office certainly reſults from the End and Deſign of that Office. It is certain then, that there is no Office and Imployment, can have a greater and better Deſign than this, namely, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Honour and Glory of God, and the Good of his reaſonable Creatures here in this World, and their eternal Happineſs in the World to come: This is the ſole Buſineſs and proper End of the Inſtitution of this Office in the World: And hence it is evident, that the End and Deſign of it, is ſuperior to that of any Station and Office whatſoever, that relates to this World only. The higheſt Office of the Civil State, that of the ſupream Magiſtrate, hath Relation only to the preſent World, to promote the Convenience and Happineſs of Men, while they live here in Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Societies together; but the Deſign and Intent of this Office, is both to promote the Peace and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Men while in this World (both influencing to all <hi>perſonal Vertues,</hi> and aſſiſting and ſtrengthening the Magiſtratical Rule and Power in promoting all that Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, and other <hi>ſocial Vertues,</hi> which it is his particular Province and Intereſt to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port among his Subjects) and alſo to perſwade Men to ſecure their everlaſting Happineſs, that when all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties here ſhall be diſſolved, they may be happy Subjects of the Kingdom of Glory, for ever and ever, I ſay, the End and Deſign of our Office is thus great and ſuperior; but what then, do we therefore claim the Honours of the World, ſuperior to thoſe of the Civil Magiſtrate? No, by no means; we leave theſe to Antichriſt, who hath exalted himſelf, not only above all the civil Powers of the World, but above all that is called God; No, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004145_0027_1003DD811B9D7540"/>
               <hi>his Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> and therefore his Miniſters being Miniſters of a Spiritual Kingdom, ought to leave the Honours of worldly Kingdoms to the Rulers of this World: And it is evident, that in thoſe parts of the Chriſtian Church where the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel have been rais'd to high Degrees of worldly Dignity, it has only tended to ruin the Intereſts of Religion, by as much raiſing their Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in worldly Regards, ſo that the Pride of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtics has been very juſtly complain'd of in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World: But we declaring ourſelves Ambaſſadors of the meek and the lowly Jeſus, it is ours to be content with ſo much of the Honours and Intereſt of this World, as ſhall keep us above Contempt and without anxious Care (for ſo much our Lord demands for us) and (aſpiring after no civil Poſts of Honour) to wait for the Honours and Glories of the next World, which our Maſter hath promiſed, when we ſhall <hi>have fought the good Fight, and finiſhed our Courſe.</hi> All that we inſiſt upon is that our Office ſhould not be look'd upon as deſpicable and low, leſt our Power and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in perſwading even to ſpiritual and divine Things ſhould be weakned and impeded among you.</p>
            <p>And I am led the rather to ſay theſe Things, in that there have been many Endeavours in this Infidel Age of the World, to make our Character low and deſpis'd, while we are repreſented as ſuch as ſhould be treated as <note n="*" place="bottom">The Independent Whig.</note> Alms-Men of the People, and of conſequence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a beggarly Condition. It is true, the Pride of ſome of the Order in the World, aſpiring after Rule and Dominion, hath very much provok'd this Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the Order and Office itſelf is not to be aſpers'd for this; and therefore there is an Indecency and Inconſiſtency in the Behaviour of ſuch as pretend
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004145_0028_1003DD904FBF1120"/>to ſtand upon the Side of Religion, and yet receive with ſo much Guſt and Reliſh, thoſe Writings which are publiſh'd with an evident Deſign to vilify that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which our Lord hath taken Care to guard againſt the Contempt of Men: Shall ſuch pretend with any Face to honour Chriſt, and yet deſpiſe thoſe his Miniſters, of whom he hath ſaid, <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 10, 16.</note> 
               <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth Me?</hi> If then the Clergy of other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions have ſtretch'd their Power, and too much exalted their State and the Dignity of their Office; yet ſo have not we, Tho' now, agreable to the Example of the Apoſtle, <hi>We magnify our Office;</hi> for if as the Apoſtle ſays in another Place, 2 Cor. 12.11. <hi>I am become a Fool in glorying, ye have compelled me, for I ought to have been commended of you, for in nothing was I behind the very chiefeſt Apoſtles, tho' I be nothing.</hi> So may I ſay of the Paſtors of theſe Churches of Chriſt in general: Ye have compelled us, for we ought to have been commended of you, for in nothing are we behind the Paſtors, (I had almoſt ſaid) of any Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the World, tho' we be nothing: If any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Paſtors of any of our Churches, aſpire after a larger Share of Rule than is compatible to the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Character, let them be oppos'd in all their Pretenſions; but the Paſtors of theſe Churches in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, have not arrogated to themſelves any Power or Dignity, other than what is allow'd to them by the Goſpel of Chriſt. If then the Power and Dignity of our Office is at any Time oppos'd, by the Adverſaries of Eccleſiaſtical Rule and Authority, let it be with Reaſon and Scripture, and in all Gravity, not with Ridicule and Banter: For as the Writers againſt the Chriſtian Religion, have ſhown their Spleen and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at it, in ſeveral Ways, ſo this hath always been one, to make a ſtrong Oppoſition, not only to the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004145_0029_1003DD96CAE0C658"/>of the Clergy, but alſo to their very Being and Office; and of theſe, there are none ſcarce that have done it more ſucceſsfully, than ſuch as have attack'd them in the ludicrous Manner, and therefore we object againſt it juſtly, as it is an unfair way of Treatment; for it is no falſe Saying, but a certain Truth, which muſt be acknowledg'd by any one that underſtands hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, and conſiders the Manner of the World, that it is no difficult Matter to gain a Victory by Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Ridicule, if the Wit be keen and free, that would never have been carried by Reaſon and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And therefore a wiſe Man, tho' he be not afraid to have his Pretences fairly examin'd, in a grave and ſerious Conſideration, yet will be afraid of Banter and Ridicule; in the ſame Manner as one that is tax'd as an Offender, conſcious of his Innocence, is ready to ſubmit his Actions to public Jnſtice, when at the ſame Time he fears to ſtand the Trial of a precipitant and inconſiderate Mob of Men, whoſe Humours, Fancy and Paſſions, are their Rule of Judgment. And ſuch is the Charm and and Faſcination of Wit, the Sophiſtical Turn of Fancy, is apt to elude the Examination of the Underſtanding, and looks like Reaſon and Argument, eſpecially to the leſs thoughtful, and injudicious (and ſuch are the Bulk of Mankind) and thus they get the Laugh and Sneer of the Multitude on their Side, and carry all before 'em; and ſuch a Procedure will certainly be always pernicious to the beſt Cauſe in the World: Such <hi>a Sport is it to Fools to do Miſchief, they caſt Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands, Arrows and Death, and ſay, Are we not in Jeſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. From what we have heard, learn <hi>the Difficulty of the Miniſterial Office.</hi> The Enemies they have to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are many and ſtrong, their Wiles and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions numerous and ſubtil, and therefore our Work muſt be laborious, diligent and perpetual, and what
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004145_0030_1003DDA057FDD880"/>can more manifeſt the Difficulty of any Employ? The Work is laborious and hard, to deviſe and ſelect thoſe ſeveral Heads of Argument, and Means of Perſwaſion that ſhall beſt convince the Mind, and ſuit our People, in their ſeveral Circumſtances; and ſome times this or the other particular Perſon, that is wander'd from the Path of Life; and to apply them in that peculiar hortatory Manner as ſhall beſt win upon their Affections and Paſſions. The Labour is hard alſo, while we oppoſe by our Rebukes and Reproofs, ſuch as are great and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, to whoſe Umbrage and Reſentment if we expoſe ourſelves, perhaps we run the Hazzard of hurting our Uſefulneſs and Succeſs. This our Labour muſt alſo be executed with Diligence, there is no Time to ſtand ſtill, leſt the Enemy gain Ground upon us. Beſides it is a Work that is perpetual, it is never over, but as long as we live, <hi>we muſt do what our Hands find to do with all our Might,</hi> to the pulling down the ſtrong holds of Satan. And is this the Office we have ſaid, is an Office of ſuch Honour and Dignity? Painful Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence this, and we may well exclaim with the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <note n="*" place="bottom">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16.</note> 
               <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe Things!</hi> Yea the Work is ſo various and difficult, that an Angel wou'd find it hard, how much more then ſhall we, who have all the ſame Corruptions of Nature, and Temptations to Sin, that are to be oppos'd in ourſelves, as well as in thoſe of our Flocks: And tho' we ſhou'd ſink under the Burden as unequal to our Strength, were it not for the promis'd Preſence and Aſſiſtance of the great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd and Biſhop of Souls, yet when we conſider that He that hath promiſed is true, that he is the great Head of the Church, and rules with a deſpotic Power as over all the Powers of Darkneſs, ſo over the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, the Paſſions and Affections of Men; we have Reaſon eno' to ſupport our Hope, if we are
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004145_0031_1003DDAAED8EEB08"/>diligent, laborious and perpetual in our <hi>Watch for the Souls of our Flocks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. From what we have heard we learn, <hi>That if Miniſters would have the Obedience, Submiſſion and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their People, they muſt do the Duties of their Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However honourable the Office may be, yet the Officer can never be ſo, without doing the Duty of his Office: If we would have the Eſteem of our People, we muſt ſtudy to deſerve it, by a conſcientious Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great Charge which we receive, when we are inveſted with this Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>That we therefore ſhew our Courage by a free Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momſtrance againſt all Vice and Immorality, in the great as well as the ſmall, fearing the Face of no Man. while doing our Maſter's Work; that we give them ſuch Inſtructions as may inlighten their Underſtandings, and tend to convince their Conſciences; that we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put them not off with extemporaneous Diſcourſes, that coſt us nothing, for we are neither to wonder nor be affronted at the Diſreſpect and Diſeſteem of our Flocks, when we ourſelves anſwer not to the Dignity of our Character, in the Solemnity, Gravity and Strength of our Diſcourſes unto them.</p>
            <p>Much leſs is the Preacher to think it ſtrange if he is diſpis'd, when his Example contradicts his Doctrine. It will indeed be very ridiculous for us to demand the Veneration of our People, if we thus bring Infamy and Diſgrace upon ourſelves. We muſt therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways guard our moral Character, with utmoſt Care and Diligence, for we are ſet up to View in the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Light, whereby every Spot will be eaſily diſcerned, and it is well if the Adverſary be not ſometimes ſo
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004145_0032_1003DDB5A831F678"/>ſharp ſighted, as to diſcover a Blemiſh where there is none? In vain, I ſay, we ſhall demand Reverence and Eſteem, when our Lives anſwer not exactly to our Doctrine. What a Jeſt is it for us to preach the Doctrines of Meekneſs and Humility, when we are thirſting after Power and Grandeur, either in the Church or State? Or when we preach againſt Covetouſneſs and Love of the World, can they ever believe us in earneſt, while they ſee us inſatiable in our Deſires of worldly Riches, endeavouring to <hi>lay thoſe Burthens of</hi> Self-denial <hi>upon other Mens Shoulders, which we are loth to touch with one of our Fingers?</hi> Or how ſhall we ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them that we believe it the Chriſtian's Duty to relieve the helpleſs and miſerable, when we ourſelves ſhall like the Prieſt in the Parable, turn aſide from ſuch as are in Want and Diſtreſs? In a Word, it will be impoſſible, and ought to be ſo, for any Miniſter of the Church of Chriſt, if he be licentious and a Libertine in his Converſation and Behaviour among his People, ever to attract any of their Eſteem and Reverence; but as ſuch are a Diſgrace to their Order, ſo let them ſuffer all that Diſgrace and Infamy which they have brought upon themſelves, only let not the innocent, the watchful and laborious, the meek and humble, the grave and religious Paſtor, ſuffer with theſe, by any general Aſperſion caſt upon the Order itſelf.</p>

               </gap> there are ſeveral other uſeful Leſſons, might be taught from the Words as we have now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd them, yet I ſhall add no more than only a brief Addreſs to thoſe for whom, by the Affairs of this Day, the Doctrines of our Diſcourſe muſt be ſuppos'd to be particularly deſign'd.

We have inſiſted upon the Dignity of the Office you are now to be inveſted with, and have in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, claim'd from his Churches, Obedience, Submiſſion and Reverence to their Paſtors; that they ſhould treat them as the Meſſengers of God, as ſuch as bring them the good Tidings of eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and are ſollicitous that they may be ſaved: And theſe reverent Regards for their Paſtor, do we now demand from this Church of Chriſt: But do we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mean that you ſhould exact and demand Reverence of them? By no means: It is true, it is theirs to give this Reverence, and to act this Obedience and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to their Paſtor; but in Prudence, not yours to demand it, in any other Way, than by your Actions anſwering all the Duties of the Paſtoral Care and Watch.</p>
            <p>Indeed in Diſcourſes of this more public kind, when we conſider the Duties of Miniſter and People, with reſpect to one another, becauſe our Lord has directed them how they ſhall behave toward their Paſtor, it is doubtleſs a Duty to ſhow what this Obligation is: But in the particular Intercourſes between a Paſtor and his own Church, it will certainly be his Wiſdom, to force their Reverence and Eſteem, rather by that Meekneſs and Lowlineſs, that Love, and Concern for their Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare in Chriſt, which the Goſpel hath made his Duty. Our Bleſſed Lord that knew what was in Man, and underſtands the humane Nature, better than all Men, hath therefore directed to this; and particularly guards his Diſciples againſt their aſpiring after Rule and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and therefore when he found them doing ſo, immediately remonſtrates againſt it, telling them, <note n="*" place="bottom">Mar. 10.44.</note> 
               <hi>It ſhall not be ſo among you; but whoſoever will be great among you, ſhall be your Miniſter, and whoſoever will
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004145_0034_1003B9B6E881FEC0"/>be chief, ſhall be the Servant of all.</hi> And the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he uſeth with them, is his own Behaviour, <hi>for the Son of Man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter.</hi> And certainly we cannot follow a better Pattern, and <hi>He was thus meek and lowly of Heart.</hi> Hence our Lord not long before his Sufferings, incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated this Manner of Behaviour upon his Diſciples, by himſelf condeſcending to that Servile Act of waſhing his Diſciples Feet. And as he applies it and ſays upon it, <note n="*" place="bottom">John 13.13.</note> 
               <hi>The Servant is not greater than his Lord, nor be that is ſent greater than He that ſent him.</hi> Follow then the Example of your Lord, by being ready to ſhew your Love and Regard to them, by doing any Labour of Love, howſoever you therein condeſcend unto them: For we are often to give up our Right to the external Tokens of Reſpect, and Evidences of Submiſſion, that may yet be expreſsly claim'd by thoſe that bear ſecular Offices; and certainly we may well do ſo, when we rule in the Hearts and Affections of our People, which He ſhall be always moſt likely to do, <hi>Caeteris paribus</hi> that ſhews the ſmalleſt Regards to the external Marks of Rule and Dominion.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſhall obtain a real Rule and Authority, while cautious of vindicating your Right to the Shew and Appearance of it: In which I imagine lies the Secret of gaining that Eſteem and Regard, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of which, the induſtrious Claims and Demands of Men, will for ever be in vain.</p>
            <p>And when by this Meekneſs of Behaviour, you have a Room in the Hearts and Affections of your People, it will very much facilitate the great Difficulties that lie before you. You have heard how great your Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties are, how hard your Labour, how conſtant and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004145_0035_1003DDD426ED2620"/>perpetual, be not then hereby diſcouraged in your Work, for your Maſter is with you, and his Grace is ſufficient for you, while you ſincerely endeavour to do the Duties of the Miniſtry, you ſhall now receive of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Let then the Doctrines with which you inſtruct this People, be thoſe of the Goſpel, teach them the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar duties of Chriſtianity, that ſhall diſtinguiſh them, as the Diſciples of Chriſt, in that Love and Charity which our Lord hath made the proper Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Characteriſtic: But forget not to lay thoſe moral Duties which our Lord hath equally demanded of us, in the Foundation of this ſpiritual Building, which, tho' a part of the Work, commonly leaſt ornamental, yet abſolutely neceſſary to the Support of the whole.</p>
            <p>And in this part of your Work, take care, in the adminiſtration of your Reproofs that it be always with Courage, but with much Wiſdom and Caution, ever remonſtrating againſt Vice whoſoever is guilty, but take care that you give no Occaſion for any jealouſy, that ſuch your Remonſtrances are the Effect of any particular Pieque and Reſentment; for your perſonal Reproofs are to be given in private, and will always require a wife Conſideration of the Tempers and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Men; watching alſo for that peculiar Situation of Mind, in which the Reproof will be moſt likely to take with them, for the <hi>mollia tempora fandi</hi> muſt never be neglected by a wife Reprover.</p>
            <p>But of how little Advantage will all this wife Care and Caution in the ſeveral Duties of your Office be, without Prayer? It is then abſolutely neceſſary, that you be a Man of Prayer: That you pray for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance in all your Studies, in the compoſition of all your Sermons, and in the adminiſtration of all
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004145_0036_1003B9EAE350D908"/>your Reproofs to every Offender. That you always bear this your Flock upon your Heart, before God in Prayer, that he would make you inſtrumental of turning them from Darkneſs unto Light.</p>
            <p>And to perſwade you to be thus watchful for the Souls of your People, I cannot uſe a ſtronger Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than that in our Text, viz. <hi>That you muſt give up an Account of them to God.</hi> Remember then every Soul is dear to God, They are ſo dear to Chriſt, that He hath ſhed his Blood for them, and is it poſſible that He ſhould not demand how you have cared for them? This indeed is a Conſideration that is eno' to make us all tremble, leſt any of thoſe Souls which our Lord hath committed to our Care, ſhould periſh thro' our Neglect. Let this Tho't therefore, make you, <hi>inſta<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> in Seaſon and out of Seaſon to rebuke and exbort, with all long-ſuffering and Doctrine.</hi> And above all let your Life and Manners be a Pattern to this People, that the Luſtre of your ſhining Example, may make them in Love with the Beauties of Chriſtianity, that following you, as you follow Chriſt, you may <hi>preſent</hi> them <hi>faultleſs before the Preſence of his Glory with exceeding Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next,</hi> I apply myſelf to the <hi>Congregation</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which are particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the great Affair before us.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever then we have ſaid, BRETHREN, as to the Submiſſion and Obedience which is to be yielded to the Paſtors of the Churches of Chriſt, we claim no other for your Paſtor now to be ſet over you, than what will be productive of theſe neceſſary Things. 1. That you honour and reverence him, 2. That you love him. And, 3. That you pray for him.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:004145_0037_1003DDE804DB4D28"/>
1. <hi>We demand of you that you honour and reverence your Paſtor:</hi> Honour him as ſuch, for the ſake of the Perſon he repreſents.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſador of a Prince is always receiv'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Deference which is paid to his Maſter, The Perſon of an Ambaſſador is little conſider'd, but with regard to his Office, He is treated with all that State and Ceremony, that is ſuitable to the Grandeur of his Sovereign. You muſt allow us the Compariſon, becauſe the Apoſtle hath legitimated it, tho' for it he hath ſcarce been able to Scape the Fleer and Scoff, of the prophane Wits of the Age. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. where he ſays <hi>We are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as tho' Chriſt did beſeech you by us, to be reconciled to God.</hi> And what is here ſpecified as the Office of an Ambaſſador, is equally the Buſineſs of the Ordinary Paſtors of the Church of Chriſt, as it was of the Apoſtles themſelves. When therefore ſuch an one comes to you in the Name of Chriſt, as his Ambaſſador, as this Servant of God doth this Day, if you honour his Maſter, you will reverence him, and otherwiſe, as our Lord hath told us, He will reſent the evil Treatment, as tho' it were offer'd to himſelf, forecited <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16. <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth Me, and be that deſpiſeth Me, deſpiſeth him that ſent Me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Love your Paſtor.</hi> As Love is the fulfilling of the Law, that is, he that hath that true Love which the Goſpel requireth, will do all the other Duties that are incumbent upon him: So it is in this Caſe; Love to your Paſtor, will comprehend all the Regards we expect from you. The Paſtors of the Churches therefore can deſire nothing more than the Love of their Flocks. For if you ſhall love your Paſtor, you will be delighted with him; This will make you to ſupport him with
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004145_0038_1003DDF64D358010"/>Chearfulneſs, ſo that he ſhall have no Reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain in thoſe Reſpects, which Complaints, however juſt they have been, yet have been the unhappy Source of moſt of the Differences in our Churches. Again, if you love him, you will attend his Teaching and Inſtruction; you will alſo be more ready to receive his Inſtructions into your Hearts; you will more kindly receive his Reproofs, for a Reproof is never receiv'd ſo well, as from one whom we love; ſo that I was going to ſay, that he that is not beloved by the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, ſhould never offer to reprove him, or at leaſt he does it with very little proſpect of Succeſs. We demand then your Love to this your Paſtor for his Work ſake, according to that of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Theſs.</hi> 1: 5.12, 13. <hi>And we beſeech you, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to know them, who labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and to eſteem them very highly in Love for their Work's ſkee.</hi> It will be alſo greatly your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, to love him perſonally, with Regard to any lovely Qualities you find in him, for that as I ſaid your Affection to Him will facilitate the Operation and Influence of all his Exhortations and Remonſtrances to you. But I proceed,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Pray for your Paſtor.</hi> It is true this Duty is included in Love, for as we always deſire the happineſs of them we Love, ſo we give a good Evidence of ſuch Deſires, when in the Sincerity of our Hearts we recommend them to the Divine Care and Bleſſing: But in as much as Prayer for him will tend to the increaſe of your Love to him, and the confirmation of thoſe amiable Qualities, that ſhall continually attract your Deſire and Eſteem, therefore I inſiſt upon it as a diſtinct Head, That you ever remember him in your Applications to the Throne of Grace, wiſely conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that when you pray for him, you pray for your ſelves and for your Children. We have already ſaid,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:004145_0039_1003DDFEDC31C600"/>it is his Duty to pray for you, let him then have your Prayers for him. Let him have your Prayers continually in your Families; pray for him in your ſecret Devotions, that God would make him an able Miniſter of the New-Teſtament, that the Influence of the holy Spirit may always accompany his Inſtructions and Warnings to you, that ſo <hi>the Pleaſure of the Lord may proſper in his Hand;</hi> that he may <hi>have many</hi> of you and of your Children <hi>for his Crown;</hi> that he may be comforted and ſupported under all the Difficulties of his Charge; that always <hi>coming to you in the Fulneſs of the Bleſſing of the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> he may at laſt render <hi>his Account with Joy,</hi> and have Many both of you and yours, that as <hi>his</hi> Spiritual <hi>Children ſhall then ariſe up and call him bleſſed.</hi>

            <head>The CHARGE.</head>
            <p>THUS, <hi>Syr,</hi> we the Miniſters of the Lord Jeſus, and in His Name, do, by the ſacred Rites of <hi>Faſting and Prayer, and laying on of the Hands of the Preſbytery,</hi> ſolemnly ordain you unto the Work of the evangelical Miniſtry, in the Church of the living GOD; and ſeperate you unto the Office of a Paſtor of this particular Church of the Lord, with whom we are now aſſembled: and thus publickly, and regularly intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you into the ſacred Miniſtry, and hand down unto you that Commiſſion, which our Bleſſed Maſter gave unto His Apoſtles, and, in them, unto all his Miniſters, to the End of the World; with full Power to act the Part of a Goſpel-Biſhop, in this holy Church of the Lord Jeſus: and we do accordingly thus open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and heartily, embrace you, our Reverend, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, Brother, in our tender Affection, and Eſteem of you, as one, and equal, with us, in the Fellowſhip of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And now, tho', we claim no manner of Authority over you yet, as Elder in Years, and more Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in the Duties, and Burdens, of your Office, Suffer us, our dear Brother, to lay the Admonitions, and Charges, of God, before you; which we cannot better do than in the Words of the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles, who, when he had ſent for the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>Act.</hi> xx. 28. <hi>Take heed unto your ſelves, and unto all the Flock, over the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004145_0041_1003DE15F4357698"/>which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers, to feed the Church of God, which He hath purchaſed with His own Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So we adviſe, and Charge you, to <hi>take heed unto yourſelf.</hi> Let this be your firſt and great Care, that you have yourſelf felt the Power, and taſted the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the divine Truths, that you may the more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly recommend them unto others. Live under the conſtant realizing Belief of thoſe Truths, and View of the unſeen World, which you invite others to believe, and hope for; and endeavour, in your Life, to exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify the Life of Chriſt, ſhewing forth the Excellency of Piety and Devotion, Temperance and Purity, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſss and Humility, Righteouſneſs and Charity, in your daily Practice. Be aſſured that a Converſation, contrary unto the Doctrine of Godlineſs, will pull down with both Hands, what you ſeem to attempt to build with one; and therefore, in all things, ſhew yourſelf a Pattern of good Works; be an Example unto the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, in Word, in Converſation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity; and ſuffer no Man to deſpiſe your Youth.</p>
            <p>We adviſe, and Charge you, to <hi>take heed unto all the Flock, over the which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you a Biſhop.</hi> Take thou the Overſight hereof, not by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, nor for filthy Lucre, but of a ready Mind. Remember that it is a Flock dearly bought, and paid for, with no leſs a Price than the Blood of Him who is God as well as Man. And ſurely, what coſt the chief Shepherd ſo dear, you, His under Shepherd ought by no Means to make light of: no; it ſhould be dearer unto you than any thing in this World. The Holy Ghoſt hath made you an Overſeer of it for this very End, that you ſhould be careful of it, and diligently tend, and faithfully feed it; even all the Flock, the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004145_0042_1003DE1F4F414600"/>Sheep, and the Lambs, the young, and the old, the high, and the low, the rich, and the poor. For all Souls are alike precious in the Sight of God, and the pooreſt coſt the incarnate Son of God as much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem it, as the richeſt. And think not the Flock to be confined to the narrow Limits of thoſe that approach unto the Table of the Lord, but look upon every bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed Perſon as belonging unto the Flock of Chriſt, until he reounces his Baptiſm; and let them all have, according to their different Circumſtances, their proper Portion of Food, of Inſtruction, Counſel, Admonition, and Warning, adminiſtred unto them, in due Seaſon: and do all you can to ſtrengthen the weak and feeble, and to recover them that wander, and to eſtabliſh the ſtrong. Thus endeavour to build up and encreaſe this holy Church of the Lord Jeſus, and confirm it in the Faith, and Order, of the Goſpel, as it is profeſſed, and practiſed, in theſe Churches, ſo far as you ſhall receive Light from the ſacred Scriptures; and watch for their Souls, as one that muſt give an Account.</p>
            <p>Furthermore; we exhort and charge you, in the Style of the ſame Apoſtle to <hi>Archippus, Col.</hi> iv. 17. <hi>Take heed unto the Miniſtry, which thou haſt received of the Lord, that thou fulſil it.</hi> Remember, that you have received this Miniſtry of the Lord JESUS, your Lord, and ours; and be very careful diligently, faithfully, and conſtantly, to attend all the Parts thereof. Fulfil thy Miniſtry by preaching the Word, be inſtant in Seaſon, and out of Seaſon; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all Longſuffering, and Doctrine; not handling the Word of God deceitfully, but, by the manifeſtation of the Truth, commending yourſelf to every Man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in the Sight of God. Let your Preaching be ſcriptural, plain, ſerious, cogent. Adminiſter the Seals of the New Teſtament, Baptiſm, and the Supper of the Lord, unto all the proper Subjects thereof, as a wiſe
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:004145_0043_1003DE288ECAC228"/>and faithful Steward, putting a Difference between the holy, and the profane. Diſpenſe the holy Diſcipline of the Church without Paſſion, or Prejudice, with Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and Reſolution, and yet with Wiſdom, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and good Advice. And Bleſs the Congregation in the Name of the Lord. Neglect not the Giſt that is in thee, but give thy ſelf wholly unto theſe things, that your profiting may appear unto many; and ſtudy to ſhew yourſelf approved of God, a Workman that needeth not to be aſhamed. Thus, we <hi>charge you before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the elect Angels; that thou obſerve theſe things, without preferring one before another, doing nothing by Partiality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Once more; we exhort, and Charge you, in the Strain of the forementioned Apoſtle, to his Son <hi>Timothy;</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 16. <hi>Take heed unto thy Doctrine, continue in them.</hi> Remember, that it is the glorious Goſpel of the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that is committed, as a ſacred Depoſitum. unto you to keep pure and entire. Determine with yourſelf to know, and ſtudy, and preach, nothing ſo much as JESUS CHRIST, and Him crucified; CHRIST, the End of the Law, the Author, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Goſpel, the Wiſdom and Power of God unto Salvation. Suffer not the Doctrines of the Gof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to be corrupted thro' your Neglect; but hold faſt the Form of ſound Words, which thou haſt heard, in Faith, and Love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus, avoiding profane and vain Babling, and oppoſition of Science, falſly ſo called. Diligently improve all the Helps, and Advantages you may have, to eſtabliſh you in the Truth, and that you may be able, by ſound Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, both to exhort, and to convince the Gainſayer. And therefore give thyſelf to Reading, Meditation, and Prayer; for in ſo doing thou ſhalt both ſave thy ſelf, and them that hear thee. And that Good Thing which has been committed unto thee, keep, by the Holy
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:004145_0044_1003DE31C59AFB78"/>Ghoſt, and the ſame commit thou unto faithful Men, who ſhall be able to teach others alſo. Thus, we <hi>give thee Charge in the Sight of God, who quickeneth all things; and before Chriſt Jeſus, who before Pontius Pilate witneſſed a good Confeſſion, that thou keep this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Spot, unreprovable, unto the appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally; Foraſmuch as the miniſterial Work has its Difficulties and Burdens, as well as its Honours, we would fairly warn you thereof, and exhort, and charge you, that you be ſtrong, and quit yourſelf like a Man. The moſt eaſy Part of your Work, and Station, we can aſſure you, is eno' to demand your Vigilance, and Fortitude; and you will, we fear, have often Occaſion to lament the Unſucceſsfulneſs of your Miniſtry. But beſides, you may reaſonably expect that Satan, and his Inſtruments, will often, and fiercely aſſault you, ſince your great Buſineſs is to beat down the Kingdom of the wicked one. And we may tell you, <hi>Syr,</hi> that if thoſe you take to be your greateſt Friends, on whom you moſtly depend, and are ready to ſay, theſe ſame ſhall comfort me, and thoſe you have done the moſt to ſerve, ſhould anon diſappoint your Expectation, and treat you unhandſomely, and, it may be, be the moſt forward to ſlight, and abuſe you; you will only experience what others have done before you. Therefore arm yourſelf with the ſame Mind that was in Chriſt Jeſus; and keep a ſtrict Watch over your own Spirit: that a worldly Temper may not betray you into Meaneſſes, and expoſe you unto Contempt; nor a paſſionate and controverting Spirit throw you into Miſchief, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſion. As much as poſſible avoid all Strife in your own Cauſe; chooſe rather patiently to bear what you meet withal: and while you are couragious, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in your Maſter's Cauſe, yet remember to ſhew, out of a good Converſation, your Works with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:004145_0045_1003DE410CB8D218"/>of Wiſdom. We therefore addreſs you, in the Words of the Apoſtle, II. <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 1, 3. <hi>Thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my Son, be ſtrong in the Grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus;—endure Hardneſs, as a good Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Remember whom you ſerve, and look to, and depend upon him, for Help; and fear not the Faces of Men, neither ſhun to declare unto them the whole Counſel of God; and thus keep yourſelf pure from the Blood of all Men.</p>
            <p>Thus, Reverend, and Dear <hi>Syr,</hi> we call upon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, and charge you, before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall Judge the quick and the dead at His appearing, and Kingdom, that you take heed unto yourſelf, and to all the Flock, over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you an Overſeer, to your Miniſtry, and to your Doctrine, and arm yourſelf againſt Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and endure Tryals.</p>
            <p>And verily, <hi>Syr,</hi> if you keep this Charge, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove yourſelf a wiſe, and faithful, Steward of the Myſteries of the Kingdom of God, and fulfil the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry which you have received of the Lord Jeſus, know it of a Truth, that your Reward ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably great: the Lord of Hoſts will number you among His Angels, who doubtleſs obſerve the preſent Solemnities, and the Vow of God which you have now taken upon you, and you ſhall <hi>ſhine as the Brightneſs of the Firmament, and as the Starrs for ever and ever; and, when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Crown of Glory, which fadeth not away.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> An Acknowledgment of the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit, conferr'd on a Miniſter, qualifying him for the Duties of his Sacred Function. <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Signification of their Approbation of, and Satisfaction in the Regularity and Validity of his Call to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Goſpel-Miniſtry. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A Teſtimony or Acknowledgment of the Parity of miniſterial Power and Authority. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A Symbol of ſacred Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Harmony and Conſent in all the ſubſtantial Doctrines of the Goſpel, and of their Union and Agreement in the Proſecution of the main Drift and Deſign of the holy Religion of our Saviour, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Salvation and Welfare of precious Souls, and endeavouring the Advancement of the Kingdom of God among Men; whatever different Apprehenſions may be among them concerning Matters of leſs Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> An Engagement to mutual Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in their Work, as Occaſion ſhall require.</p>
            <p>And it is with ſuch Views and Intentions as theſe, <hi>Sir,</hi> that I do now, at the Requeſt of the reverend Elders and Meſſengers here conven'd in Council, and in the Name of the former, Give unto you, Dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>the Right Hand of</hi> our <hi>Fellowſhip;</hi> ſignifying, and
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:004145_0048_1003B939289B9970"/>declaring hereby our grateful Eſteem of the miniſterial Gifts, Graces and Qualifications, wherewith it has pleaſed the Father of Lights to enrich you, and that we look upon you as a true and lawful Miniſter of Chriſt, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly called, ſet apart, and introduc'd to the Paſtoral Office in and over this Church, intitled equally with us to all that Office-Power in the Church which Chriſt has committed to his Miniſters, promiſing and engaging to you, and at the ſame Time expecting from you, ſuch Help and Aſſiſtance by Prayers and Counſels, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our ſeveral Abilities, as the Service of the common Cauſe of Chriſtianity in our reſpective Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſhall require.</p>
            <p>And now, Brother, tho' the Work you have engaged in, be attended with peculiar Difficulties and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (and, I doubt not, you have reckon'd upon the Labours and Self-denials, the Prayers and Watchings, the Studies and Cares, that the faithful Diſcharge of it will coſt you) yet that which ſhould ballance all, and enable you, and us, to ſurmount all diſcouraging Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, is the gracious Promiſe which our aſcended Lord has left his Miniſters, which has been a tryed Word, and ſtill remains in full Force, to all that humbly, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently, and prayerfully depend upon it; <hi>Lo, I am with you always, even unto the End of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May our Bleſſed Lord, whoſe you are, and whom you have devoted yourſelf to ſerve, afford you much of this his promiſed Preſence, aſſiſting, directing, and ſucceeding all your miniſterial Labours! May the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit be increaſed in you, and abound in the exerciſe of them to the Converſion and Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many Souls, that the Pleaſure of our Lord Redeemer may proſper in your Hands, and that by the faithful Execution of the ſolemn Charge you have
