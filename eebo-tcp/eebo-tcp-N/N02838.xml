            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But the Angel appeared to them, and said, <hi>Fear not; for behold, I bring you good Tydings of great Ioy, which shall be unto all People; for unto you is born, this Day, in the City of David, a Saviour, which is Christ, the Lord.</hi> The Shepherds encouraged, and directed, by the Angel, went immediately to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi>

            <p>There are several things observable in the Words of my Text; but there are but Two or Three, which I shall more particularly take Notice of, to discourse unto you on, at this Time, and upon this Occasion. As,</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Birth, or Incarnation of JESUS CHRIST, the Son of GOD.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Time of His Birth, or when it was.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The great End and Design of His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation and Birth. I shall begin with the first of these; and accordingly,</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am to consider the <hi>Birth,</hi> or Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of JESUS CHRIST, the Son of GOD. <hi>Unto you there is born, Christ the Lord.</hi> And here, there are several Things worthy our Consideration, with respect to the Birth of Christ; as,</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Certainty of the Birth, and Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ the Son of GOD.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Of whom he was born, and</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Place of His Nativity, where he was born. I shall offer something to each of these. And</p>
            <p n="1">I. I shall consider the <hi>Certainty</hi> of the Birth and Incarnation of JESUS CHRIST, the Son of God.</p>
            <p>And what can be more evident and certain than this is? What that we do not see with
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003389_0008_0FF824036A8066D0"/>
our Eyes, is confirmed to us by so many, and various kinds of Witnesses? The Angel published it to the Shepherds, assuring them, that <hi>unto you is born a Saviour, Christ the Lord</hi>: That is, the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Son of God, and Saviour of the World. And this the Shepherds had full Proof and Evidence of, when they went to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what the Angel had told them, found <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother, and <hi>Ioseph,</hi> the reputed Father, and <hi>the Babe lying in a Manger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was further confirmed by the Wise Men of the East. For they (concluding the Strange Star they had seen in the Heavens, was an Indication of the Birth of the great Prince, spoken of in the <hi>Iewish</hi> Writings, and which the World was now earnestly looking for) after they had travelled some Hundreds of Miles from <hi>Persia,</hi> to satisfy their Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity about this wonderful Phaenomenon, at length came to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Iudea,</hi> near to which the Star, or Light, had been seen pendant <note n="†" place="bottom">or perhaps, moving from the East to the West, towards <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; as Mr. <hi>Whiston</hi> supposes, <hi>Chron.</hi> p. 165.</note>, and enquire, <hi>where is He that is born King of the Iews? For we have seen His Star in the East:</hi> And when they were informed, by the learned Men among the <hi>Iews,</hi> that <hi>Bethlehem</hi> was to be the Place of the Nativity of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> they travelled thither; and the Star, which they
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003389_0009_0FF82405666E5160"/>
had seen in the East, appeared again to them, and went before them, until it stood over the Place where the young Child lay, and so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them to the particular House, in this miraculous manner, that they might not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon by any suppositions Birth; and <hi>they came into the House, and saw the young Child with Mary His Mother, and fell down and worshipped Him, — and presented unto Him, Gold and Frankincense, and Myrrh</hi>

            <p>Besides there were many Witnesses at the Birth of <hi>Christ.</hi> For when <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> had travelled from <hi>Nazareth</hi> to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> to be taxed, or enrolled <note n="†" place="bottom">The Taxing spoken of in <hi>Luke</hi> II.1. was only an E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And further, <hi>Herod</hi> the King, fearing the Loss of his Kingdom, from this Child, who was styled <hi>the King of the Iews,</hi> by the Wise Men of the East, and slaying all the Young Children in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> from two Years old, and under, <note n="(b)" place="bottom">

            <p>This Child, thus born into the World, was no other than the Accomplishment of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Promise of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Son of God, appearing in the human Nature: For it was the Divine <hi>Logos,</hi> the Eternal Son of God, that <hi>became Man,</hi> and was born of a Woman. Hence our Lord said, <hi>Ioh</hi> III.16. <hi>God so loved the World that he gave His only begotten Son.</hi> And thus at the Baptism of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, it was declared by an audible Voice from Heaven, <hi>Matt.</hi> III.17. <hi>This is my beloved Son:</hi> And the Devils themselves confessed Him

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I am in the next place to consider <hi>of whom Christ</hi> was born; namely, of a <hi>Virgin</hi> the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> And therefore we are told of <hi>Mary, Luke</hi> II.7. That <hi>she brought forth her first born Son,</hi> which is spoken of <hi>Christ.</hi> And that this <hi>Mary</hi> was a pure <hi>Virgin,</hi> who had never known a Man, when she brought forth this her first born Son, is evident from the Conference of the Angel with her. For we are told, <hi>Luke</hi> I.17. That the Angel <hi>Gabriel was sent to a Virgin, espoused to a Man whose Name was Ioseph</hi>; and at <hi>v.</hi> 31. he tells her, that <hi>she should conceive in her Womb, and bring forth a Son, and should call His Name Iesus.</hi> And when the holy <hi>Virgin</hi> was surprised at his saying, as well she might be, and replyed, <hi>v.</hi> 34. <hi>How shall this be, seeing I know not a Man?</hi> The Angel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the Mystery to her, and lets her know, that the holy Child, which should be born of her, should not originate in the Common Way of Generation, but by a Divine Incuba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the Almighty Power of God forming a Child in her Womb, without the natural
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003389_0012_0FF8240A43F32778"/>
and ordinary Means therefor: <hi>v.</hi> 35. <hi>The Angel answered, and said unto her, the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the Power of the Highest shall overshadow thee, therefore also that holy Thing, which shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God.</hi> Such was the miraculous and immaculate Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blessed <hi>Iesus</hi>!</p>
            <p>This also the Gospel of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> takes notice of, and informs us, <hi>Matt.</hi> I.18. That <hi>Mary was</hi> but <hi>espoused to Ioseph</hi>; and that, <hi>before they came together, she was found with Child by the Holy Ghost.</hi> This is further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s Carriage to her, upon this Affair; for he finding her to be with Child, while she was contracted to him, and before their coming together, concluded she had been guilty of Fornication (or rather Adultery, as being his espoused Wife) and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have put her away, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further to do with her; till an Angel from God satisfyed him of her Innocency, that she was a <hi>pure Virgin,</hi> who had not been guilty of any criminal Conversation with any Man, but <hi>was with Child by the Holy Ghost.</hi>
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.19, 20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In all of this was but fulfilled what was anciently praedicted concerning the <hi>Messiah.</hi> For the very first promise of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> seems to imply no less, than that He should
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003389_0013_0FF8240C37BA9A00"/>
be born of a pure <hi>Virgin,</hi> without any carnal Concubinage; and therefore He is called <hi>the Seed of the Woman, Gen.</hi> III.15. Where the <hi>Woman</hi> only, and not <hi>Adam,</hi> the <hi>Man,</hi> is taken notice of, as from whom the <hi>Messiah</hi> should proceed, who should <hi>bruise the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents Head.</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> III.15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But this was more plainly spoken of, by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah, Ch.</hi> VII.14. <hi>Behold a Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call his Name Immanuel.</hi> I know the latter <hi>Iews,</hi> and with them the Atheists and Deists of the present Age, would fain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us, that by <hi>Virgin,</hi> here is meant, <hi>a Young Woman,</hi> in general, whether marryed or unmarryed; and they suppose it no such mighty matter for a Young Woman, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if marryed, to bring forth a Son; and they suppose further that the Woman intended is, the Prophets Wife, who should have another Son, and before that Son, now to be born of her, should know to refuse the Evil, and choose the Good, <hi>Ahaz</hi> should be delivered from the Enemies that now encamped against him.</p>
            <p>But to make this matter plain, I need on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to observe, that as it was no such great thing for a Woman to bear a Son; so a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in the general, or a marryed one in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, bringing forth a Son, would not amount to the Nature of a Sign, which is what the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003389_0014_0FF8240DD4F714A8"/>
Prophet is evidently here speaking of. And besides the learned in the Hebrew Language agree, that the Word <note n="†" place="bottom">

            <p>But then let us consider the Design of the Prophecy, and that will greatly enlighten this matter. The evident Design of this Prophecy was to Comfort and encourage <hi>Ahaz,</hi> who, with <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was in great Fear, that the Combination of <hi>Resin,</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Pekah,</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> now investing <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> with their united Forces, would carry all before them, and utterly destroy the Royal Stock, the House of <hi>David<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ahaz,</hi> obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately (or perhaps modes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>y) refused to ask a Sign, as the Prophet proposed to him, and therefore the Prophet tells him, <hi>the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self shall give you a Sign</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> VII.11.14.</note>. Now a Sign ever means something out of the ordinary Course, or beyond the Power of merely natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Causes, and yet evident to our Senses; and what this Sign should be, the Prophet tells him in the next Words, <hi>Behold, a Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call
<pb n="13"
                      facs="unknown:003389_0015_0FF82410192E6D28"

His Name Immanuel.</hi> Tho' it be but agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Course of Nature for a Woman to conceive, and bear a Son, yet for a pure <hi>Virgin</hi> to do so, is beyond the Power of Second Causes; and it's being something unheard of, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the ordinary Power of Nature, is that which rendred it a Sign. Now this being but a Repetition, in other Words, and in a strong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r Light, of the ancient Prophecy concerning the <hi>Messiah,</hi> who was to be the <hi>Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and of the <hi>Lineage of David,</hi> was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Assurance to <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that they should not be utterly destroyed, because the <hi>Messiah</hi> was yet to come; so that they had no need to be so terribly affraid of the threatned Destruction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for God will certainly remember His Word, and make good His Promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and to the House of His Servant <hi>David.</hi> And because this locked a great Way off, and did not seem to carry in it that Encouragement which was necessary to scatter their present Fears, the Prophet from God, further tells <hi>Ahaz</hi>

            <p>So that the Sign, which the Lord gave <hi>Ahaz</hi> by His Prophet, concerning <hi>a Virgin</hi>'s <hi>conceiving, and bearing a Son,</hi> was but a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ratification of what God had promised to His People of old, and therefore an Assurance to <hi>Ahaz,</hi> that the House of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> should not be destroyed, because His Promise yet remained to be made Good to them; which make the Words to be a clear Praedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of the <hi>Messiah</hi>'s being born of a <hi>Virgin</hi>; and it was punctually fulfilled in His Birth of the Blessed <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi>

            <p n="2">II. To consider the <hi>Time</hi> of our Blessed Lord's Nativity, or when <hi>Christ</hi> was born. And this I shall do, first more generally, and then more particularly.</p>

of, as pointing to the Time of the <hi>Messiah</hi>'s appearing in the World, both of which have had their full Accomplishment in the Coming of Christ.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> I shall mention is the famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy in <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Blessing his Son <hi>Iudah,</hi> which is contained in <hi>Gen.</hi> XLIX.10. <hi>The Sceptre shall not depart from Iudah, nor a Lawgiver from between his Feet, until Shiloh come.</hi> By <hi>Shiloh</hi> is meant the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi> as the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves before our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Time ever acknowledged. <note n="*" place="bottom">All the three Targums, <hi>Onkelos</hi> written before Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this has been very punctually fulfilled.</p>
            <p>For it is very evident, that this foreign Power continued in the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> in a Line of Kings that descended from <hi>David,</hi> from his Time, down to the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; and in the Time of that Captivity, tho' their State was exceedingly broken, yet were they governed, in <hi>part,</hi> by Rulers of their own set over them, in the Land of <hi>Iudea,</hi> and <hi>chiefly,</hi> by their own Laws, and

their own <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> or Council, which still preserved something of the Sovereign Power, even in their Dispersions among the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>; till at length the <hi>Persian</hi> Emperour fully restored the Sovereign Power to them. And thro' all the Disturbances which they afterwards met with, from the <hi>Syrian,</hi> and <hi>Egyptian</hi> Princes, yet still they had some of the Sovereignty among them, even to the Birth of <hi>Christ.</hi> For at that Time, <hi>Herod</hi> who, we are told <note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Prid.</hi> con. vol.

calls <hi>Cyrenius,</hi> annexed it to their Empire, and placed a <hi>Roman</hi> Governour over it, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it to the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws. From this Time, the <hi>Sceptre departed from Iudah</hi> and <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver from between His Feet</hi>; and this was more plainly evident, when, not many Years after, the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, under <hi>Titus,</hi> destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their City, and Nation, since which Time they have had no Pretensions to Sovereign Power.</p>
            <p>This therefore proves, that the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the promised <hi>Shiloh,</hi> was then come, and that He came about the Time when <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> first appeared in the World, and whatever the latter <hi>Iews</hi> pretend, yet the former readily confessed they had lost their Sovereignty, when they said, <hi>Ioh.</hi> XVIII.31. <hi>It is not lawful for us to put any Man to Death</hi>; and when they replied to <hi>Pilate,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, (who brought forth <hi>Iesus</hi> to them, a little before His Crucifixion, and said, Behold your King,) <hi>we have no King but Caesar, Ioh.</hi> XIX.15.</p>

and to build Ierusalem, unto the Messiah, the Prince shall be seven Weeks, and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and two Weeks; (the Street shall be built again, and the Wall, even in troublous Times:) and after threescore and two Weeks shall Messiah be cut off.— He shall confirm the Covenant with many for one Week; and in the latter half of the Week He shall cause the Sacrifice and Oblation to cease.</hi>— The <hi>Seventy Weeks</hi> are allowed by all to mean <hi>Weeks of Years,</hi> according to the Prophetick Style, that is, 490 Years. These <hi>Seventy Weeks</hi> are divided into <hi>Three Periods,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Seven Weeks,</hi> or 49 Years, to <hi>restore and to build Ierusalem, Sixty two Weeks,</hi> or 434 Years, from thence to the <hi>appearing of the Messiah the Prince.</hi> And <hi>one Week,</hi> or seven Years from thence, for the confirming of the Covenant; which last Week seems to have a Sub-division belonging to it, by the Expression, <hi>in the Dividing,</hi> or in the <hi>latter Part of the Week, the Messiah the Prince shall be cut off, and finish Transgression, and make an End of Sin</hi>; or put an End to all other Sacrifices for Sin by the Sacrifice of Himself.</p>
            <p>The main Difficulty here is, to understand, what Decree, or Commandment is intended by the Prophecy, that we may know, from whence to Date the 70 <hi>Weeks,</hi> or 490 Years: For there were several Decrees issued out, in Favour of the <hi>Iews,</hi> by the <hi>Persian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours.</p>

            <p n="2">2. To a more <hi>Particular</hi> Consideration of it. And here it may be enquired.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What <hi>Month,</hi> and <hi>Day</hi> it was, on which <hi>Christ</hi> was born? And</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether that Day ought to be <hi>kept, in Memorial</hi> of His Birth? I would offer something to each of these briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">I. What <hi>Month,</hi> &amp; <hi>Day,</hi> was it, in which our Blessed Saviour, <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> was born? The Angel says, in my Text, <hi>This Day</hi> is born unto you, a Saviour; and doubtless, it was the very individual Day on which Christ was born, that he said so. But what particular Day of the Month was that?</p>
            <p>And in Answer to this Enquiry, it must be affirmed, that, so far as we are yet acquainted
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003389_0030_0FF82430366D1EE8"/>
with the History of those distant Times, no Man can certainly tell, on what Day His Birth was. This I think is confessed by all that have laboured most in the Search after it. But then tho' the individual <hi>Day</hi> cannot be particularly and positively determined, yet we may come pretty near the Time, and be able to discover the <hi>Month</hi> of our Saviour's Nativity, by observing some things, which lye plain before us. As</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> We may observe what St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, <hi>Luke</hi> II.8. <hi>There were in the same Country,</hi> (viz. <hi>Bethlehem) Shepherds, abiding in the Field, and keeping watch over their Flocks by Night.</hi> Now it is well known, that <hi>Iudea</hi> is a cold Country, in the Winter Season <note n="*" place="bottom">

Frost and Snow not a great deal short of what they are sometimes, among us: And therefore the dead of Winter can by no means be tho't a proper Season, for the Shepherds to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, in the Field, watching their Flocks by Night. So that it looks very unlikely, from this Circumstance that the Nativity of <hi>Christ</hi> should be in the Depth of the Winter.</p>
            <p>But then, <hi>Secondly,</hi> we know that our Lord entred upon His Publick Ministry, at, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, the compleating of his <hi>Thirtieth</hi> Year, which the Evangelist <hi>Luke</hi> takes particular Notice of, <hi>Luke</hi> II.23. <hi>Iesus himself began to be about</hi> 30 <hi>Years of Age,</hi> that is, it was about the compleating of His 30th Year. This refers to the Time of His Baptism, and entrance, upon His Publick Ministry; for in His return from <hi>Iordan,</hi> He was led by the Spirit into the Wilderness, and having there mastered the Temptations of the Devil, <hi>from that Time Iesus began to preach, and to say, Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at Hand</hi>; as we read <hi>Matt.</hi> IV.17.</p>
            <p>Now it is generally supposed that <hi>Christ</hi> continued His Publick Ministry, for the space of <hi>Three Years and an Half,</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Prid.</hi> Vol. IV. p. 94<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Seven Years,</hi> spoken of by <hi>Daniel,</hi> for the <hi>confirming the Covenant.</hi> So that there was evidently an odd <hi>Half</hi> Year in the life of <hi>Christ.</hi> And it is very plain, that He was crucified at the Time of the <hi>Iews</hi> Passover, as appears from, <hi>Ioh.</hi> XVIII.39. and XIX.14. which was upon the 15th Day of the Month <hi>Nisan,</hi> that is about the last of our <hi>March,</hi> or beginning of our <hi>April</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Whiston</hi> fixes it to the 3d of <hi>April, Har.</hi> p 193.</note>. Deduct half a Year from this, and it carrys back the Birth of <hi>Christ</hi> to the <hi>Iews</hi> Month <hi>Tisri,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Feast of Tabernacles, which answers to the latter end of our <hi>September,</hi> or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>October</hi>; at which Time, it may well eno' be supposed, the Shepherds might lye out in the Field, watching their Flocks by Night.</p>
            <p>So that tho' we cannot find the very indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Nativity, yet it can be proved, almost to a Demonstration, that He was born in or near to <hi>Tisri,</hi> sometime in <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> or <hi>October,</hi> about the Time of the Creation of the World, and about the Four Thousandth Year from the Creation. But I am to enquire,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether the Day of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Nativity ought to be kept, in Memorial of His Birth?</p>
            <p>You all know, that a great Part of the Christian Church observe This very Day, the <hi>Twenty Fifth of December,</hi> in Remembrance of the Day of the Nativity of our Lord. But
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003389_0033_0FF8243757A7BD88"/>
whether there be any Obligation lying upon us, as Christians, to keep such a Day, will be seen by observing a few things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It is to be observed, that no Church can keep the <hi>true Day,</hi> on which <hi>Christ</hi> was born: Because it is not known to the World, as I have already remarked. And it looks something odd, to select a Day, and keep it, in Memorial of <hi>Christ</hi>'s being born on <hi>that</hi> Day, when, at the same Time, they know it was not the Day of His Nativity. And, by the Way, because the Day is not known in the World, this is a very cogent Proof, that there was no such Custom in the primitive Church as the keeping the Birth Day of <hi>Christ.</hi> For if there had been any such Practice in Use in the first Ages of the Church, doubtless they would have known the Particular <hi>Month</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if not the individual <hi>Day</hi>; because they lived so near, to the Time of it, that it would have been no great Difficulty, to have infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themselves thorowly, if they had had any particular Regard to <hi>that Day,</hi> above all the Days in the Year.</p>
            <p>This Usage was firstly introduced by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. For when <hi>Rome</hi> became <hi>Christian,</hi> perhaps a Willingness to oblige the <hi>Pagans,</hi> as much as might be, moved them to take <hi>their Festival Days,</hi> which they were so mightily fond of, and convert them to a <hi>Christian Use</hi>; hoping, by this Means, the
<pb n="32"
                   facs="unknown:003389_0034_0FF824395629C078"

easier to gain the remaining <hi>Pagans,</hi> to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the <hi>Christian Institution</hi>; and the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnalia</hi> of <hi>Pagan Rome,</hi> being celebrated in the Month of <hi>December,</hi>

<q>That the Christian Holy Days, or solemn Commemorations of our Saviour and His Apostles — seem to have been first fixed by the Christian Church not on the Days of their Births or Deaths, of which generally they were wholly Ignorant, but on the Sun's Entrance into Signs, especially those that were the Equinox, and Solstice Days, and on such Days as were noted among the Heathen, and were Days of Riot and Idolatry; that so those pernicious Solemnities of the Heathen Worship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Remains of the Heathen Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertision, might, by Degrees, be supplanted and worn off, by the holy and Spiritual Solemnities of the Christian Religion.

            <p>Upon all which, I cannot see the least Room to suppose, that there is any Obligation lying upon Christians, to observe any Day, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of the Birth of <hi>Christ,</hi> much less the Day that is kept as such.</p>

            </p>
            <p>So that the main End of His Birth was, to be a SAVIOUR unto the World. Therefore it is that, <hi>That Word,</hi> which, the Apostle tells us, was in the Beginning, and was
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:003389_0038_0FF8244274F68478"/>
with God, and was God, <hi>was made Flesh, and dwelt among us</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> I 1, 14.</note>; that is, became Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and was born of a Woman, without which He could not have been a <hi>Saviour</hi> to us. For tho' he might have Taught, and Governed us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking our Flesh upon Him; yet he could not have had a Body, to offer as a Sacrifice for us, if He had not taken our Nature upon Him; and without This there could have been no Salvation.</p>
            <p>To this the ancient Types and Praedictions concerning Him looked; and this He Himself assures us of, when He says, <hi>Ioh.</hi> III.17. <hi>God sent not His Son into the World to condemn the World, but that the World, thro' Him, might be saved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Iews</hi> ever expected the promised <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi> would be a <hi>Saviour.</hi> But then <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> was not born into the World, to be such a <hi>Saviour</hi> as they imagined and looked for, only a <hi>Temporal Saviour,</hi> to deliver that Nation from all their Enemies, and erect a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Kingdom, in greater Pomp, and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deure than had ever yet been seen among them. No; He was born to be a <hi>Spiritual Saviour,</hi> which is by far the Greater; He became In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate to save his People from Sin, and Death, from Guilt, and the Wrath and Curse of God, which that Guilt had exposed them to. And
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:003389_0039_0FF824448030A138"/>
accordingly the Evangelist <hi>Matthew</hi> informs us, <hi>Matt.</hi> I.21. <hi>He came to save his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their Sins, and therefore is His Name called Iesus.</hi> And the Apostle, in his Epistle to the <hi>Galations,</hi> acquaints us, what was the End of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Incarnation, when he says, <hi>Gal.</hi> IV.4, 5. <hi>When the fullness of Time was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons. Iesus Christ</hi> became Incarnate, to recover us from the Power and Dominion of Sin, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil over us, and the Sentence of Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that was out against us, and to restore us to the Favour and Friendship of God, and a Life of Obedience to Him; to entitle us to the Dignity and Priviledges of the Children of God, and to regain that Heaven and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness for us which we had lost.</p>
            <p>Thus he was born a <hi>Saviour</hi>; and that not to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation only, but to the <hi>Gentile</hi> World, even to all Nations of Men, who have the Grace of God appearing to them in the Gospel of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> our Lord; for He is given to be <hi>a Light to lighten the Gentiles, as well as the Glory of His People Israel</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And the two Names by which He is here described declare him to be so. He is CHRIST, this is His Name, and peculiarly His.

               </gap> us, to adore the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of God, and be encouraged to Believe, and Trust in His Word.</p>
            <p>Let us adore the Faithfulness of God, in Fulfilling the Word He has spoken, in the exact Accomplishment of so many of His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prophecies, as we have seen, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that great one; on which the whole Welfare of Mankind depended, His sending the <hi>Messiah,</hi> a SAVIOUR, into the World. And since we see, that God has so punctually made Good His Word, in so many Instances, let us learn, never to Disbelieve, or Distrust the Word of God, but live in the full Expectation of the exact Accomplishment of such of the Prophecies, as yet remain to be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>Let us learn hence, to Live in a quiet De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon the Word of Promise, which
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:003389_0043_0FF8244DADC87580"/>

            <p>And especially should we learn hence, to Trust God with the Fulfillment of His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to us, relating to our future State, even the Hope of Eternal Life, which God, that cannot lye, has promised, before the World began, upon our Faith and Obedience to His Son; and be encouraged thereby to a constant unwearied Abounding in all the Duties of the Christian Life, as knowing, we shall certainly reap, if we faint not; for <hi>Faithfull is He that has promised,</hi> and will perform it <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

            <p n="2">II. Hence, since the Son of God is become Incarnate, let this serve to teach us our Duty, and our Comfort.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Duty</hi>; that we be exceeding careful, not to debase that Nature, which the eternal Son of God has taken into an Union to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. That therefore, we do not allow our selves in any Sin whatever, but cleanse our selves from all Filthiness of Flesh and Spirit, and perfect Holiness in the Fear of God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all Sin is a debasing of the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and brings a Stain and Blemish upon it,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:003389_0044_0FF8244F4A604000"/>
and is therefore to cast Indignity upon the Son of God Himself, who has highly exalted our Nature, in being united to our Flesh.</p>
            <p>It speaks the <hi>Comfort</hi> of all true Believers also. For now we have a SAVIOUR, who partakes of the same Flesh and Blood with our selves, and therefore who sincerely desires our Happiness, who has a Fellow-Feeling with us in all our Sufferings, who knows our Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Sorrows, and has a most tender Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion to us under all our Wants and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>who will not suffer us to be tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what we are able, but will, with the Temptation find out a Way for our escape, that we may be able to bear it</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">I. <hi>Cor.</hi> X.13·</note>.</p>
            <p>Now the MAN JESUS, in Union to the SON of GOD, is exalted at the right Hand of the Throne of the Majesty on High, who, having, the Dominion put into His Hands, will certainly over-rule, all things for the Welfare of His Church; will gather in the whole Number of his Elect, and not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer one of them to be lost; will cause all things to work together for Good to them that Love God; and will ransom their Bodies from Destruction, and bring them to dwell in His Presence thro'out Eternal Ages.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Lastly,</hi> Let us all then, make it our great Care, that this <hi>Saviour</hi> be Ours, that
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:003389_0045_0FF824524B4BAD88"/>
we are interested in Him, and share in His blessed Benefits.</p>
            <p>This is the great Design of the whole Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of <hi>Christ,</hi> His Incarnation and Life, His Doctrines and Example, and His Sufferings and Death, to prevail with a guilty World, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure an Interest in Him, that they may be saved by Him. And if the wondrous Grace of God, in providing such a Saviour for us, should after all be slighted by us, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to accept of His offered Mercy, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our selves to Him as our Lord, it will but greatly enhanse our Account, and encrease our Punishment, that God has sent His Son, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in our Flesh, as a <hi>Saviour</hi> for us, but we would not come unto Him, that we might have Life.</p>
            <p>Let us all then, be perswaded to take this <hi>Iesus</hi> for our <hi>Saviour,</hi> rejoicing in the good Tydings, and praising the Grace of God that has provided Him for us, saying, in the Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the holy Angels, in my Context, <hi>Glory to God in the highest, on Earth Peace, Good-will towards Men</hi>!</p>
            <p>Let us receive Him as the anointed of God, and firmly believe all that He has done, and suffered for us, and spoken to us; and give up our selves to Him to be saved by Him; and submit our selves intirely to His Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as our LORD; for He will not be our <hi>Saviour,</hi> unless we know assuredly that

            <head>APPENDIX. An Attempt to State the <hi>true Year</hi> of the Birth of CHRIST.</head>
            <p>I Readily, and thankfully, acknowledge the Assistance I have received, from Dr. <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi>'s noble <hi>Connection of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the New,</hi> which I have chiefly followed in the <hi>Chronology,</hi> and very much so in the Explanation of the Prophecies in the foregoing Discourse; since the Composing of which, Mr. <hi>Whiston</hi>'s <hi>Chronology of the Old Testament, and Harmony of the New,</hi> has fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into my Hands, which I had not seen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and the Difference I observed between them, and my own Difficulty in reconciling either of their Accounts, to what I tho't the Evangelist <hi>Luke</hi> pointed to us, namely the Age of <hi>IESUS CHRIST,</hi> when He was Baptised, (which would help to Direct us to the Time of His Birth,) has led me to spend more Time, than the First Composing the Sermon would allow me, in a diligent Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into the True Year of the Birth of CHRIST. And tho' it is very apparent that I <hi>now</hi> fix the Birth of CHRIST up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

a Different Year from that mentioned in the Foregoing Sermon, and go off from it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in some other smaller Matters; yet, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, it may well eno' be allowed me, in a more general and common Discourse, to fall in with the Current of the best of Writers, in a piece of <hi>Chronology,</hi> while in a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and laboured one, afterwards, I see rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to fix upon other Periods of Time. For having, I think, diligently surveyed, and compared, Dr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whiston</hi>; and taking their Quotations upon Trust, as well I may, and not having the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors by me; I conclude I may, with good Reason, advance the following Proposition, wherein I crave Leave to dissent from those two Great Men; <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>That our Blessed Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST, was born, some Time in <hi>October, Anno Iul. Per.</hi> 4711.</p>
            <p>To make good this Proposition, which is so New, and different from what all others, that I know of, have said upon this Subject; I shall first, state the exact Time of our Lords Death, and then produce the Arguments, which sway with me, to fix his Birth upon the Year men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>

            <p>Now Mr. <hi>Whiston</hi> makes it plain, to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, by calculating the several <hi>New-Moons,</hi> that the 15th Day of <hi>Nisan,</hi> could fall upon a <hi>Friday,</hi> only in the Year mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

So that the Year of our Lord's Death, is fixed, and certain, and both Dr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whiston,</hi> agree in it, that it was <hi>An. P.

are, the Age of our Saviour at His Baptism, and Entrance upon His publick Ministry; the Time of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Death; and <hi>Archelaus</hi>'s Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment; and the Baptist's Conception.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> JESUS CHRIST, was Baptised, and entred upon His publick Ministry, at 30 Years of Age, <hi>An. I. P.</hi> 4741. This appears from these Considerations.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> It seems Evident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> plainly proves, <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Harm.

            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> At this First Passover, in the Beginning of the Year 4742, our Lord is apparently in the Publick Exercise of His Ministerial Office. His Whipping the Buyers, and Sellers, out of the Temple: His having His Disciples about Him; His Discourse of His Death, (taken Notice of, in <hi>Iohn, Ch.</hi> II.) as well as His publick Baptizing, (<hi>Ioh.</hi> III.26.) is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Proof of this, that JESUS CHRIST was then in the Discharge of His publick Ministry.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> JESUS CHRIST was Baptised, and entred upon His publick Ministry, some Time before this first Passover. This appears

from what the Disciples of <hi>Iohn</hi> say to him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> III.26. <hi>He that was with thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Iordan, to whom thou bearest Witness,</hi> &amp;c.

And it is further Evident, both from St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> Ch. IV. <hi>Luke</hi> Ch.

Now less than Half a Year could not well suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for all these Transaction, and about Half a Year might well eno' give Time for these several Occurrents; so that this brings us back from <hi>Nisan,</hi> the <hi>Iews</hi> first Month in <hi>An.

The particular Remark, in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon his Office, in the 15th or 12th of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> was designed to measure out the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Daniel</hi>'s last <hi>Week</hi> of Years; for it was exactly <hi>Seven</hi> Years from that Time, to the Death of CHRIST: The <hi>Baptist,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan His Ministry at the Paschal Feast, <hi>An.

            <p>Now if we consider, that some Time was clapsed before <hi>Antony</hi> came to <hi>Antioch,</hi> that then <hi>Antigonus</hi> is sent a Captive in Chains to <hi>Antioch,</hi> above 200 Miles distance from <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> if I mistake not; and the Pains <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> is put to, (which doubtless occasioned the Dispatch of Messengers backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward this 200 Miles,) before he could, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>Ambition</hi> of <hi>Antony,</hi> and compass the Death of <hi>Antigonus</hi>: I say whoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders this, will see it needful to allow, <hi>Two,</hi> if not <hi>Three</hi> Months, from the taking of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> to the Death of <hi>Antigonus</hi>; and so his Death, and the Date of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Reign, will fall in with the latter End of <hi>August,</hi> or rather of <hi>September</hi>; to which if we add the 34 Years of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Reign, it brings us down to the latter End of <hi>August,</hi> or <hi>September, An. I. P.</hi> 4711<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself says <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Harm</hi> p. 153.</note>, we must look for <hi>Herod</hi>'s Death, as near as possible to <hi>Iuly, A. I. P.</hi> 4711; (I would rather say to <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> in that Year) and yet he chooses to place it in <hi>Nov. A. I. P.</hi> 4710, which certainly is further distant from the fixed <hi>Iuly,</hi> (much
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:003389_0059_0FF8247385ABB8A0"/>
further from the real <hi>September</hi>) than <hi>Nov. A. I. P.</hi> 4711.</p>
            <p>The Difficulty that attends this Matter, seems to arise, from the Uncertainty, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were redundant, or defective Months, belonging to <hi>Herod</hi>'s 34 Years; one or other of which appears certain, and yet no ancient Historian has told us which. But tho' this is not handed down to us with Certainty, yet, from what has been observed, we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably conclude, that there were some few Months, over and above 34 Years belonging to <hi>Herod</hi>'s Reign.</p>
            <p>For, it <hi>Herod</hi>'s Reign commence from the Time of the taking of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter End of <hi>Iune,</hi> there must be full <hi>Seven</hi> Months deducted out of his 34 Years; but if his Reign Commence from the Death of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> as all Historians agree it does, there must be at least <hi>Nine</hi> or rather <hi>Ten</hi> Months deducted, to bring his Death to the Latter-End of <hi>Nov. An. I. P.</hi> 4710. And doubtless few Historians would call that 34 Years, which really was but 33 Years and some few Months.</p>
            <p>But, on the other Hand; if <hi>Herod</hi>'s Reign take its Date from the Caption of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> then there is scarce <hi>Five</hi> Months, but if, as is the Truth, from the Death of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> then there remains not <hi>Three,</hi> or rather not <hi>Two</hi> Months more than the 34 Years for his Reign, to bring his Death to <hi>Nov. An. I. P.</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="unknown:003389_0060_0FF82475DAD00380"/>
4711. which also is the nearest <hi>Nov.</hi> to <hi>Iuly,</hi> (rather to <hi>Sept.) An. I. P.</hi> 4711.</p>
            <p>Now it seems much more likely, that <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus,</hi> the Jewish Historian, should omit ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Notice of <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three</hi> redundant Months, in assigning 34 Years to <hi>Herod</hi>'s Reign, than that he should include <hi>Nine</hi> or <hi>Ten</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective ones, much the bigger half of the Year, in the whole Sum of 34 Years, which he tells us <hi>Herod</hi> reigned: and therefore I conclude that <hi>Herod</hi> dyed sometime in <hi>Nov. An. I. P.</hi> 4711. which will be further evident from the Reign and Banishment of <hi>Archelaus.</hi> And if we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the Transactions, from the taking of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to the Death of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> took up 4 or 5 Months, which is not unreasona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> it is not to be wondered at, that <hi>Iosephus</hi> took no Notice of a few Weeks in the Reign of <hi>Herod.</hi> Since therefore <hi>Herod</hi>'s <hi>Death</hi> was in the latter part of the Year, <hi>I. P.</hi> 4711. our Lords Birth, which praeceeded it but a few Weeks, doubtless was in the same Year, and Month I have advanced in the Proposition.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

                  <hi>Connec.</hi> Vol. IV. p 929,</note> assigned the whole Sum of <hi>Ten</hi> Years to the Reign of <hi>Archelaus</hi>; but this seems to have been done to make the Length of his Reign comport with the Death of his Father <hi>Herod,</hi> which he places in <hi>An.

            <p n="1">1. It is well known, that the <hi>Iewish Priests</hi> were divided into, Twenty four Courses, and that each Course served it's Week at the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And we are assured, that <hi>Zachariah,</hi> the Father of <hi>Iohn,</hi> was of the Course of <hi>Abiah, (Luke</hi> I.5.) which was the <hi>Eighth</hi> Course in Order.

            <p>The Order of these Courses was restored after the Captivity, and whatever Interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was given to them, during the broken State

                  <hi>Harm.</hi> p. 157.</note> from the famous <hi>Iewish Chronicle,</hi> that when the Temple was burnt, by the <hi>Romans,</hi> upon <hi>Aug.</hi> 4th <hi>An. I.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is plain, that <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s Course, and the <hi>Baptist</hi>'s Conception, must be more than a Year before the Birth of CHRIST. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Allowance, there would not be Room for <hi>Elisabeth's</hi> Hiding herself Five Months, before the <hi>Virgin's</hi> Conception, and for the Time of the holy <hi>Virgin</hi>'s Praegnancy, to her Deliverance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s Course went out upon <hi>Aug.</hi> 5th <hi>An. I. P.</hi> 4710.

I find <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s, or the <hi>Eighth</hi> Course to go out, <hi>Aug.</hi> 5th <hi>An. I.

<pb n="63" facs="unknown:003389_0065_0FF82480DE5B8F88"/>
Two and Three Months more than a Year to the Birth of CHRIST, in <hi>October An. I. P.</hi> 4711.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Whiston,</hi> by a like Calculation, observes the Time of <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s Ministration to fall on the Beginning of <hi>Sept.</hi> as it truly does, <hi>An. I. P.</hi> 4709. and he Assigns <hi>October</hi> 25th the Year after, for the Time of the Birth of CHRIST. But if he had more thorowly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remarked the Times, I imagine, he would have seen, that his fixing <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s Course to the Beginning of <hi>Sept. An. I. P.</hi> 4709. as he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily must, for that Year, would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed his main Design, of ascertaining the Birth of CHRIST upon <hi>Octo.</hi> 25. <hi>A. I. P.</hi> 4710, instead of proving it.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Eighth</hi> Course, to which <hi>Zachari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> belonged, finishing their Ministration upon <hi>Sept.</hi> 3d, the Sabbath in the first Week of that Month, <hi>An. I. P.</hi> 4709, we need only to allow Two Days, from thence, for <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah</hi>'s return to his House at <hi>Hebron,</hi> about 30 miles Distant from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and for his Wife <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisabeth</hi>'s Conception, which brings us to <hi>Sept.</hi> 5th. From thence we must allow <hi>five Iewish</hi> Months, or 21 Weeks, and 3 Days, for the Time, in which <hi>Elisabeth</hi> is said to <hi>hide her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> which brings to <hi>Feb.</hi> 2d, in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Year <hi>I. P.</hi> 4710. We must, doubtless, allow another Week, at least, for the Propriety of the Angel's Speech to <hi>Mary (Luke,</hi> I.36. <hi>This is the Sixth Month with
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:003389_0066_0FF8248356026640"/>
her that was called barren</hi>; which leads us to <hi>Feb.</hi> 9th; and the <hi>Nine</hi> Months, of the <hi>Virgin</hi>'s going with Child, will unavoidably bring us to <hi>Nov.</hi> 9th. So that by this Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Virgin</hi> must necessarily have brought forth her first born Son, something more than a Fortnight before her full Time, which may, by no means, be admitted. And therefore upon Mr. <hi>Whiston</hi>'s own Principles, of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah</hi>'s Ministration going out, in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>September, An. I. P.</hi> 4709. JESUS CHRIST cannot be supposed to be born, upon <hi>October</hi> 25. <hi>An. I.P.</hi> 4710. And if the Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances should be made greater than I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, (smaller they cannot be) it will render it still but so much the more unlikely, if not impossible.</p>
            <p>But, on the other hand, <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s Course going out upon the <hi>Fifth</hi> of <hi>August, An. I. P.</hi> 4710, as I have observed, the <hi>Two Days</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for his Return to his House, and for <hi>Elisabeth</hi>'s Conception, makes <hi>Aug.</hi> 7th for the Time of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi>'s Conception; from whence, the <hi>Five Months,</hi> or 21 Weeks and 3 Days, of <hi>Elisabeth</hi>'s Concealment; brings us to <hi>Ian.</hi> 4th the Beginning of the <hi>Iulian</hi> Year 4711; and a Weeks Entrance into the <hi>Sixth</hi> Month, as before, leads us to the <hi>Eleventh</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> for the Time of the <hi>Virgin</hi>'s Conception; and <hi>Nine</hi> Months, from <hi>Ian.</hi> 11th to the Time of the Birth, carries us down to <hi>October</hi> 11th in the Year

of the <hi>Iulian Period</hi> 4711, the Year and Month proposed in the Proposition. And no other Year but this will receive any Evidence, for the Birth of CHRIST in <hi>October,</hi> from the Principle of <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s Ministration, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated from <hi>Ioiarib</hi>'s being the first Course, and finishing his Ministration upon <hi>Aug.</hi> 4th <hi>An. I.

And if the <hi>Fifteenth</hi> of <hi>Tisri,</hi> should have happened upon the <hi>Third</hi> of our <hi>October,</hi> that Year, as the <hi>Fifteenth</hi> of <hi>Nisan</hi> did upon the <hi>Third</hi> of our <hi>April, Thirty-four</hi> Years and an <hi>half</hi> after, when our Lord was crucified, then the Birth of CHRIST, falling upon the 11th of our <hi>October</hi>
