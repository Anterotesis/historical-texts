            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>POTTSTOWN, JANUARY 12th, 1800. Yeſterday the Inhabitants of this village and its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity aſſembled, to add their tribute of love and veneration for the great and good GENERAL WASHINGTON, to that ſo univerſally paid by other parts of his admiring country.—The morning was uſhered in by firing ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen guns, and a gun was afterwards fired every half hour during the day. About noon a military and maſonic proceſſion was formed, which proceeded in the following order to the Church, the muſic playing a ſolemn dirge—the bell being muffled, and minute guns firing during the whole ceremony.</p>

The Military marched with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved arms, their drums muffled, and ſtandards and muſic in mourning.

<pb facs="unknown:036848_0003_100B21B69CBF92C8"/>
facing inward, and reſting on reverſed arms; form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an avenue through which the Bier and remainder of the Proceſſion paſſed into the church, where a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diſcourſe was delivered by the Rev. Mr. John Armſtrong, from 2 Sam. iii. 38—"<hi>Know ye not that, there is a Prince and a great Man fallen this Day in Iſrael.</hi>" The Bier was then taken from the church, and the ceremonies concluded by firing three vollies over it—After which the troops were formed, and marched off; the drums unmufflled and colours diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, the Muſic played <hi>Waſhington's march,</hi> to the place of parade, and were diſmiſſed. Capt. M'Clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuch acted as officer of the day.</p>
            <p>It would be injuſtice to the Military and to the Citizens not to obſerve, that the greateſt order prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed during the whole of the ceremonies.

            <p>Theſe are the words of King David, when Abner fell by the hand of Joab. It was indeed at a critical moment, at the time when the houſe of Saul and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036848_0005_100B21BAE351DEC0"/>
the houſe of David were to be united. And happy it is, when contending na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions come to this bleſſed period, that they will no longer bath their ſwords in human blood, but be united in love, and agree to have one King to rule over them; and that is Chriſt, the King of Kings. David ſeemed much troubled for Abner, for he ſaid to his ſervants, <hi>Know ye not that a Prince and a great Man is fallen in Iſrael</hi>—As if he had ſaid, do you know, are you ſenſible of the loſs of ſuch a man at this time, a time of trouble, and great changes taking place. It is ſaid, that David and the people wept over Abner. But my dear friends and fellow citizens; may I not ſay, know ye not that there is a Prince and a great Man fallen—Know ye not, ye Sons of America and of thoſe nations who are involved in war, and ſtaining the field with human blood, that WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON the Great is fallen; but not by the hands of a Traitor as Abner fell, but by the hands of a kind Providence. He that in mercy gave him to his Country, has taken him from us; and it ought to be the language of every Chriſtian, the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036848_0006_100B21BD087F4718"/>
Lord gave and the Lord has taken away, and bleſſed be the name of the Lord. It is our duty to bleſs the everlaſting God, that he has ſpared him ſo long in the Land of the living. But it is only the grace of God that can enable us to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify him at <hi>all</hi> times. It may juſtly be ſaid that a Prince and a great Man is fallen. In the firſt place it will be neceſſary to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the Appellation that is given in the Text, in the ſcripture ſenſe of the words, namely <hi>a Prince and a great Man,</hi> and ſee how far theſe words agree with the preſent ſolemn occaſion—The firſt of theſe that comes under our conſideration is the appellation of a <hi>Prince.</hi> It is well known, that it is a title of honour given to the Son of a King, a Sovereign or a Chief Ruler—but ſome of my hearers may ſay, <hi>that</hi> was never given to our late General. Now I grant it was not. According to our Conſtitution, titles are done away. Yet is it not plain to every underſtanding, that he poſſeſſed thoſe ſublime qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, which juſtly merit the title of a Prince. My friends, were they not like the Sun, giving Light and heat, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> and bringing great
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036848_0007_100B21C0B32C20D0"/>
things to light? But this title is not only given to King's Sons, but to God the Governor of the world, and likewiſe to Chriſt, the Saviour of Mankind. It is ſaid Iſaiah Chapt. 9, vers 6, "For unto us a Child is born—Unto us a Son is given, and the governement ſhall be upon his ſhoulders, and his name ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the wonderful Counſellor, the mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the <hi>Prince</hi> of peace." He may well be called the Prince of peace, for it is through him and by him that we have Peace of Soul now, and Everlaſting peace in the world to come—and it is <hi>ſuch</hi> that the world can neither give nor take away—Sweet peace he gives to that Soul, that is weeping and longing for his preſence, and is willing to become a true and a faithful Subject to the Prince of peace. Bleſſed be God, this was Chriſt's Legacy, which he left to all his followers to the end of time, John, Chap. 14, v. 27. "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth, give I unto you, let not your heart be troubled. Neither let it be afraid." And as Prince he gives peace to his ſubjects, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> mighty Prince
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036848_0008_100B21C2D7EA2970"/>
he maintains that Peace as in the caſe of the children of Iſrael, when Pharaoh purſued them, Exodus Chap. 14, v. 28. "And the waters returned and covered the chariots, and the horſemen, and all the hoſt of Pharaoh, that came into the Sea after them, there remained not ſo much as one of them." The Lord in all ages has appeared in their behalf. "The Stars in their courſes ſhall fight for Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael." Or does he countermand nature in any of its motions, and bid the Sun ſtand ſtill in Gibeon, and the Moon in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of Ajalon, it is that the armies of his people may have long Daylight, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due their enemies. Hailſtone and Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhall break out of the clouds, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Cananites, when Iſrael is at war with them. But if Iſrael wants bread in the wilderneſs the clouds ſhall drop down Manna, and give them bread from heaven. And how did the Lord appear for Peter, when he was kept in priſon, Act, Chap. 12, v. 7. "And behold the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light ſhined in the priſon, and he ſmote Peter on the ſide and raiſed him up, ſaying, ariſe up quickly, And his chains fell off
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036848_0009_100B21C511E56BC0"/>
from his hands." Here you ſee Peter is bound, the angel unties him, he knows not where he is, the angel goes before him and guides him. In Revelation, Chap. 1 &amp; 5. Jeſus Chriſt is ſtyled "the faithful witneſs, and the firſt begotten of the dead, and the Prince of the Kings of the Earth." As a Prince and a King he has a right to give laws and rule over his Subjects. Their dependance is upon him, from whom they receive their power and government, their protection and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But more eſpecially are his people, indebted to him—for he leads them from victory to victory until he brings them to that Kingdom of Glory, that ſhall never end. His power as a King is great, for none dare ſay unto him, what doeth thou—he can turn the children of men into duſt, and bring down the mighty from their Seats—and who can ſtay his hand? The Kings and Princes of this world have great power over their ſubjects. Many of them wantonly ſpil the blood of their people, and lay many heavy burdens upon them. But let them remember, they muſt appear before the mighty Prince, and anſwer for
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036848_0010_100B21C698CD51C8"/>
their conduct. And as it is common for the Kings and the Princes of this world, to puniſh thoſe that rebel againſt them; ſo will the Judge of all the Earth puniſh thoſe who deſpiſe his Council and his reproof, eſpecially every open and profane ſinner. And as Paul tells us—Titus Chap. 1. 16. "They profeſs that they know God, but in works they deny him, being abominable and diſobedient, and unto every good work reprobates." There are no ſort of perſons ſo odious to God, and ſo abominable in his ſight, as thoſe who make a profeſſion of his holy name and truth, but walk contrary in their lives to that profeſſion. And in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, thoſe that profeſs to love their Prince and prove Traitors, are ſeverely puniſhed—and of ſuch St. Paul is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and I fear there are too many in this our day.</p>
            <p>But in order that we may know them, let us ſee if we cannot diſcover them in 2 Tim. Chap. 3, vers 4 &amp; 5: "Traitors, heady, highminded lovers of pleaſures more than lovers of God; having a form of Godlineſs, but denying the power thereof—from ſuch turn away." Is not

this the caſe with many, who deny the power of God, and the love of God in the ſoul; and poſitively declare, that there is no ſuch thing as knowing that Sin is forgiven, and the Spirit of God bearing witneſs in men that they are the children of God—"From ſuch turn away," for they are robbers of Chriſt, and diſhonour him in the greateſt degree—and yet they will go to the table of the Lord; And like Judas betray the Son of Men. But remember that he will appear as a mighty Prince to the utter deſolation of all his enemies, as it is written in Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians Chap. 1, v. 8 &amp; 9. He will come "in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them, that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord and from the Glory of his Power." Remember what he decleared concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Jews and Jeruſalem, and that the prophecies came to paſs. We are told by "Joſephus, fearful ſights and great things were ſeen, a Star in a ſhape like a ſword, hanging over Jeruſalem for a long time together—Armies fighting in

the clouds, and what he reckons worſe than all, the extraordinary conduct of one Jeſus, an apparent Lunatic, who for more then ſeven years went about the city, proclaiming, woe to Jeruſalem? woe to the city, and to the temple and to the people, and could by no means be reſtrained."</p>
            <p>The Supreme Judge and Prince of the Kings of the earth did not let the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous conduct of the Jews go unpuniſhed. The moſt ſignal marks of divine Juſtice purſued them. We are informed by Dr. Moſheim's Church hiſtory, Vol 1. p. 323: "As indulgence was given by Julian for the Jews to rebuild the temble of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, they ſet about it, from which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were obliged to deſiſt before they had even began to lay the foundation of the ſacred edifice. For while they were removing the rubbiſh, formidable balls of fire, iſſuing out of the ground with a dreadful noiſe, diſperſed both the works and the workmen, and repeated earthquakes filled the ſpectators of this aſtoniſhing phenomenon, with terror and diſmay. This ſignal event is atteſted in a manner that renders its evidence irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable

"God will not be mocked." Call to your minds theſe words in the Revelation Chap. 6, v. 15—And the Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every free men, hid themſelves in tde dens, and in the rocks of the mountains." When Chriſt will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear an angry Lamb, the great ones in the world will fall before him; thoſe that do not comply with the heavenly Prince, ſhall feel his wrath. Where my Fellow Citizens, where can you go from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,—none but Jeſus can do helpleſs Sinners good—
<q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Sinners turn, why will ye die?</l>

                     <l>God, who did your being give</l>

            </p>
            <p>But the Appellation, is given to the Church of Chriſt—they are called Princes, in Samuel 2 Chapt. 8th vers. "He raiſeth up the poor out of the duſt, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to ſet them among <hi>Princes,</hi> and to make them inherit the throne of glory, for the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars

of the Earth are the Lords, and he hath ſet the world upon them." But ſome of my hearers may ſay, are they ſo by nature? I anſwer—NO, they were children of wrath as others, born in ſin and brought forth in iniquity, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us of ſome who had been guilty of great crimes—1 Cor. Chap. 6, vers 11. "And ſuch were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtifyed in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God." Thanks be to God, thoſe who are of a princely nature, are changed by the Grace of God; that grace that enab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les them to preſs forward to that heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prize. They know that this is not their reſting place, for their Prince and King has a better country for them—they have a building with God, not made with hands, they can ſweetly ſing:

It is natural to think that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt will ſtrive to be like him; for he ſays: Learn of my, for I am meek and lowly of heart. It is their wiſh and deſire, that their ſouls ſhould be happy here and glorious hereafter. Remember what the Apoſtle ſaith: Thoſe that are born after the Spirit, do mind the things of the ſpirit—and the ſame Spirit purifyeth their Souls by faith in Chriſt, and longing for a growth in grace, ſuch as Love, Peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, good faith, meekneſs. Theſe are the beautiful ornaments the Chriſtian deſires to wear. The King doth greatly deſire thy beauty, and holineſs of heart. They are born for a noble end. It ts common for the Sons of Kings to wear coſtly garments—ſo do the Princes of God—they are clothed with a coſtly garment, not of their own making, No, that will not cover them.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Thy Righteouſneſs wearing,</l>

               <l>In the Preſence of God.</l>

            <p>It is true many of them are labouring under great troubles, and ſorely buffeted

by Satan, and meanly thought of by the wicked and the ungodly—It will be but a little while, and when Chriſt ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear they ſhall be like him. Yet they are princes and ſhall wear the glorious garment, Pſalm 45, v, 13, 14, 15. "The Kings Daughter is all glorious within, her clothing is of wrought Gold, ſhe ſhall be brought unto the King in Remnants of Neadle Work—the virgins, her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that follow her, ſhall be brought into thee, with gladneſs and rejoicing ſhall they be brought, they ſhall enter unto the Kings Palace." Let the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt rejoice, for it will not be long until they ſhall enter into his glory. The Sons of Kings have a great many attendants and ſo have the Princes of Chriſt, for all is yours for God is yours. Are not angels miniſtering ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation; Thoſe glorious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are their attendants in life and in death,—they convoy them to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of light. And what is beſt, they have God—"Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Iſrael, for I am with you." Happy People! When the Prince of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036848_0017_100B21D5E7CD21F8"/>
Princes, the King of Kings, doth meet with them, they can truly ſay, he brought me to the banquetting houſe, and his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner over me was love. But as they are Princes, they are entitled to a crown, and a kingdom—In the Revelations, Chap. 1, v. 6 "And he hath made us Kings and Prieſts unto God—And his father, to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever, Amen." Their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is an everlaſting kingdom.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>How can it be thou Heavenly King;</l>
               <l>That thou ſhouldſt us to Glory bring</l>
               <l>Make Slaves the Partners of thy throne</l>
               <l>Deck'd with a never-failing Crown.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>They reign as Kings, not in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral but in a ſpiritual ſenſe, they reign as Kings over unruly luſts and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, over Satan, over the world, over death, the King of terrors—They reign upon earth, without which it is impoſſible to triumph in heaven—when the Chriſtian has finiſhed his courſe with patience and perſeverance—"he ſhall wear the Crown of Life."</p>
            <p>Earthly Princes have great power—and ſo have the Princes of God—It is ſaid of Abraham "thou art a mighty Prince
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036848_0018_100B21D76E588850"/>
among us." Great is their power with God. When the Lord was going to deſtroy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Gen. Ch. 19, v. 22, he ſaid to Lott, Haſte thee, eſcape thither, for I can not do any thing till thou become thither." And Abraham plead with the Lord for that very city—I realy believe if it were not for the Princes of God, there would ſoon be an end to this world; they often plead with God in mighty prayers. The Angel that wreſtled with Jacob, ſaid: "Thy name ſhall be called no more Jacob, but Iſrael, for as a Prince haſt thou power with God and with man, and haſt prevailed." I pray God, that there were more wreſtling Jacobs, that the Lord would revive his work in this our day, that there might be an ingathering to his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom—There ſhould we meet, where the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and the weary are at reſt. I can not yet leave this head, without admiring the patience of the bleſſed God, and King of Kings, who, tho' ſo ſtrong and powerful, yet is provoked every day.—Surely as is his majeſty, ſo is his mercy. If I villify but the name of a monarch, I loſe my liberty and am confined to the dungeon or

ſlavery. If I appear in arms and draw the ſword againſt my national ſovereign, my life is forfeited, and my very blood will ſcarcely atone for the crime. But have we not all diſhonoured thee O thou King, immortal and inviſible—happy are they that are under the ſhadow of his wings—But wo unto his enemies! Hear what the Prophet Samuel ſaith, Chapt. 2-10: "The adverſaries of the Lord ſhall be broken to pieces, out of heaven ſhall he thunder upon them—the Lord ſhall judge the ends of the earth and he ſhall give ſtrength unto his King, and exalt the horn of his anointed."</p>
            <p>But we are told in the Text, that he was a <hi>great Man:</hi> A man may be great, and not be great in the ſight of the Lord. We ſome times call a rich men a great men, and often they are very wicked—and God is not in all their thoughts—There are great philoſophers and men of learning and eloquence—many of whom deny that Chriſt is the Son of the moſt high God. How little does God eſteem the things that men count great! the endowments of wit and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036848_0020_100B21DD131715C0"/>
eloquence that men admire ſo much:—Alas<hi>!</hi> How poor are they to him! "for it is written, I will deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe, and bring to nothing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the prudent—where is the wiſe, where is the ſcribe, where is the diſputer of this world—hath not God made fooliſh the wiſdom of this world?" This may be applied to God for he alone is great, great in goodneſs and mercy, love and wiſdom—and great in puniſhing the wicked, for great is ſin when it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt a great God. Deuter, Chap. 10, v. 7. "For the Lord your God is God of Gods, and Lord of Lords, a great God, a mighty and a terrible God, who regardeth not perſons, nor taketh reward." For to be great in the ſight of God, is to know God, to have our ſins pardoned, and the witneſs of his holy Spirit and Grace, to overcome the world, and ſay with a heartful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, 1 John Chap. 4, v. 16: "And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us—God is love and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him." This indeed may be called great, where the Lord dwelleth. It

is ſaid, by Iſah. 5, Chap. 57, and vers 15: "For thus ſaith the high and lofty one that inhabits eternity, whoſe name is holy—I dwell in the high and holy place—with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit, to revive the heart of the contrite ones." If God reigns in their hearts, they muſt be great in love and in ſaith, in uſefulneſs and in integrity: for the glory of God, and the good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are truly great objects—They are little men in the ſight of God, that live in the world to little purpoſe, who do little for God and mankind—The Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian has a great deſire, that all ſhould come and pertake of the goodneſs of God—Pſalms, Chap. 18, 35.

            <p>But it is ſaid, "<hi>that a Prince and a great Man is fallen</hi>"—Our brave WASHINGTON is fallen—O Death! thou mighty deſtroyer, thou, who haſt brought Kings from their thrones and Princes from their ſeats—and haſt cut down the youth in the prime of life, and vigour of health, while his breaſts were full of milk, and his bones moiſtened with marrow. O Death! how doſt thou ſurpriſe the youth, and bring the aged to the grave!

God. O death! thou art preparing a bed in the duſt whither we ſhall ſhortly be followed by weeping mourners, and muſt take up our lodging, till the heavens are no more. Well might Solomon ſay: "And the doors ſhall be ſhut in the ſtreets, when the ſound of the grinding is low, and he ſhall riſe up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of muſic ſhall be brought low." O death! thou haſt taken one of the beſt of Generals, why didſt thou take him? his country weeps—thou king of terrors—but it is the Lords doings, let him do what ſeemeth him good. But did I ſay the king of terrors? No, he is not the king of terrors to the new born ſoul—Death opens the gate for the beloved of the Lord—"lift up your heads O ye gates—and be ye lift up ye everlaſting doors, that the heirs of glory may enter in." How calm is their eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of life—In what a ſmiling ſerenity does their ſun go down—the followers of the Lord ſeem pleaſed and triumphant, even in their laſt moments—"God's everlaſting arms are underneath them."

of my incapacity of doing juſtice to the memory of this truly great Man. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a genius like his own. Where ſhall I begin? Tell me, ye great men, who often heard wisdom drop from his lips—and ye noble warriors, who fought under his banner; you ſaw him, when troubles ſurrounded him; you, who ſaw him lead the armies of America into the field of battle—to maintain your rights—and ſaw him with honour returning from the field of blood. View him as a warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, he was not like many of the proud kings and princes, who do not regard the lives of their ſubjects, but are deaf to the cries of the widows and fatherleſs children,—NO, he knew, that their lives were dear to their families and to their country, and to themſelves. How many Generals, by their baſe conduct have been unable to lead their men on in the day of battle—and have fallen before their enemies.

            <p>I think my hearers, the words of Job may properly be applied to him, Job, ch. 29, v. 7: "When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my ſeat in the ſtreet, the young men ſaw me and hid themſelves, and the aged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe and ſtood up, the princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.

            <p>After he had filled that important ſtation as Preſident of his country with honour—he retired to prepare for a more glorious kingdom, not regarding the honour of this periſhing world, and I have no doubt but he ſaw it all vanity of vanities.</p>

It appears, my hearers, that our great WASHINGTON, in all the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable ſcenes of life, had his eye fixed on the great Creator of all things. He was not aſhamed to confeſs his God, as the only ruler of the world, and the fountain of all happineſs. But we truſt he is gone to receive the glorious reward: Well done good and faithful ſervant.—And no doubt, it will be remembered with applauſe what he has done for this nation, as long as it exiſts. May I not ſay as Moſes ſaid: "Happy art thou, O Iſrael, who is like unto thee O people ſaved by the Lord,—the ſhield of thy help: and who is the ſword of thy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency—and thy enemies ſhall be found liars unto thee, and thou ſhall tread upon their high places."—</p>
            <p>What Nation enjoys ſuch civil and religious liberty as we do—remember what troubles the Chriſtians underwent in ages paſt—the followers of Chriſt were often put to death by wicked kings and rulers. Under ſome princes we ſee the moſt diligent ſearch made after the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt, and on bare information, or their own confeſſion, immediately
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:036848_0031_100B21F6EBB018E8"/>
dragged away to execution—unleſs they prevented their puniſhment by Apoſtacy. Under others, we ſee inhuman ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates endeavouring to compel them by all ſorts of tortures to renounce their profeſſion. Many fell by the hand of bloody perſecutions, and expired in the cauſe of the divine Saviour—The Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians ſuffered under that monſter of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Nero—he accuſed them of having ſet fire to the city of Rome, that horrid crime which he himſelf had committed, with a barbarous pleaſure.—In avenging this crime upon the innocent Chriſtians he ordered matters ſo, that the puniſhment ſhould bear ſome reſemblance to their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: he therefore wrapped up ſome of them in combuſtible garments, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered fire to be ſet to them, when the darkneſs came on, that thus, like torches they might diſpel the obſcurity of the night; while others were faſtened to croſſes or torn in pieces by wild beaſts, or put to death in ſome ſuch dreadful manner. According to ſome ancient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, St. Paul and St. Peter ſuffered martyrdom then.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:036848_0032_100B21F9C80832B8"/>
Others have ſince ſuffered for the cauſe of Chriſt, under Lewis the XIV.—What horrid ſcenes then took place! Fathers and mothers having beheld their ſuckling infants periſh in their ſight, were themſelves afterwards put to death by the moſt cruel tortures—and if any to eſcape theſe barbarities endeavoured to ſave themſelves by flight, they were purſued into the fields and woods, and were ſhot at like wild beaſts.</p>
            <p>Many alſo in England, Scotland, and Ireland, ſuffered greatly. But thoſe that are not much acquainted with hiſtory, may think theſe things not true: they are however eſtabliſhed on the beſt autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. What a great mercy that we are not under theſe bloody Princes! But I fear we do not ſufficiently value our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges. We have line upon line.—Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is only ſweet to thoſe who have lately groaned under the cruel bondage of tyranny and oppreſſion—and health is only ſweet to thoſe who have long been afflicted with ſickneſs. Happy it will be for us, if we are truly thankful to God for all his mercies and the privileges of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:036848_0033_100B21FB4CA39498"/>
his Goſpel. Deut. Chap. 4, v. 6-10. "Keep, therefore, and do them, for this is your wiſdom and your underſtanding in the ſight of the nations, which ſhall hear all thoſe ſtatutes, and ſay, Surely this great nation is a wiſe and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding people. For what nation is there ſo great, who hath God ſo nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for? And what nation is there ſo great, that hath ſtatutes and judgments ſo righteous, as all this law which I ſet before you this day? Only take heed to thyſelf, and keep thy ſoul diligently, leſt thou forget the things which thine eyes have ſeen, and leſt they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; but teach them thy ſons, and thy ſons ſons."</p>
            <p>Ingratitude is a great ſin in the ſight of God. The prophecy of our Lord we have ſeen remarkably fulfilled in our days—and yet God has been graciouſly pleaſed not to ſuffer any one of thoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities to come near our dwellings.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen nations riſe up againſt nations, and kingdoms, againſt kingdom;
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:036848_0034_100B21FD74B30338"/>
we have ſeen fire and ſword conſume round about us, and many fruitful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries ravaged and deſtroyed, yet at the ſame time we have ſat, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, enjoying all the bleſſings and happineſs of peace—we have ſeen want and famine ſpread de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation over different countries, whilſt we have been even luxurious in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of overflowing plenty,—we have heard of populous and flouriſhing towns, overthrown in one day by an earthquake; while our habitations have been, as the Scripture ſpeaks, the munition of rocks; he that feareth God ſhall abide under the ſhadow of the Almighty, under his ſecure protection. When we look to the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Jewiſh nation, from the coming out of Egypt to their final captivity, it is one continued inſtance of Providence, watching over the righteous—when they came to enter into the promiſed land, no force was able to ſtand before them. And when they were poſſeſſed of it, no nation was able to drive them out, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly when the whole body of them went up to Jeruſalem to appear before the Lord thrice in the year,—their land
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:036848_0035_100B21FF9B815220"/>
was by a peculiar providence preſerved from being invaded. So long as they kept God's commandments, ſo that he did not behold iniquity in Jacob, neither had ſeen perverſeneſs in Iſrael; they were conſtantly happy and dwelt ſafely—And though we often read indeed, that they were oppreſſed by their enemies, and brought to great diſtreſs, yet this never happened, but when they had firſt depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from their integrity. Let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, if we forſake God, He can commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion his deſtroying Angel, to ſmite us in a moment—Or if we continue to provoke him, he can inflict judgments upon us much more ſevere, than the moſt devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring peſtilence, by delivering us into the hands of men, whoſe mercies are cruelty, and equally deſtructive of the lives and the ſouls of men, by taking away the key of knowledge, and eſtabliſhing ignorance and utterly deſtroying the foundations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> all regard to God, and all truth, juſtice and righteouſneſs towards man. Then let us with one conſent, ſtrive to walk in the fear of God—and when we make choice of men for our rulers and judges and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, let them be men of clean hands,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:036848_0036_100B22028F6D6EB0"/>
and firm friends to the religion of Jeſus Chriſt. God forbid that we ſhould make choice of thoſe men, that are enemies to the Goſpel of our Lord. If we do, we ſhall bring down the judgments of God upon us—They will be the greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to our nation, however, wiſe they may be in politics. Let them be men that follow the practice of virtue and true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and eſpecially where it is more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as in the choice of governors, who, if truly pious moſt illuſtriouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the true vice-gerents of God. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the words of our late Preſident, in his Addreſs to the People of the United States: "<hi>Of all diſpoſitions and habits, which lead to political proſperity, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Morality are indiſpenſible ſupports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotiſm, who ſhould labour to ſubvert theſe great pillars of human happineſs—theſe firmeſt props of the duties of man and citizens, the mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to reſpect and to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. A volumn could not trace all their connections with private and public felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—let it ſimply be aſked, where is the ſecurity for property, for reputation, for
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:036848_0037_100B220414030818"/>
life, if the ſenſe of Religious obligations deſert the oaths, which are inſtruments of inveſtigations in courts of juſtice.</hi>"</p>
            <p>May the Lord ſend down his holy Spirit upon our Preſident—and upon all our Governors, and Judges! And may he raiſe up more like our worthy Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who will prove friends to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and ſupporters of the goſpel of Chriſt—Let us contribute our utmoſt, each in our proper ſtation, to ſupport a Government ſo happily eſtabliſhed—that it may be as little burdenſome as poſſible in the hands wherein it is lodged, Jer. 29, 7: "To ſeek the peace of the city," or country, wherein we dwell, is Man's duty and intereſt, even under bad Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments: how much more ſo under the beſt and moſt wiſely conſtituted Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the world, by which our rights, liberties and religion are firmly ſecured.</p>
            <p>Now my fellow citizens, and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, you that are ſoldiers in defence of your country, let me intreat you, to be ſoldiers of Chriſt, and "put on the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:036848_0038_100ADCAFB8A261F0"/>
whole armour of God, that ye may be able to ſtand againſt the viles of the devil." You have loſt your General. But may Chriſt, the King of Kings be your King—and may you fight under the banner of <hi>him,</hi> that died for <hi>you.</hi>—</p>
            <p>And, my Fellow Citizens, we have loſt a Friend, and Father to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try—if the Lord takes an Elijah, he is able to raiſe up Eliſha—and I truſt, that we <hi>have</hi> one.—Let me conclude with a few words by way of application—I fear there are ſome here, this day, that very ſeldom come to the houſe of God, and who are rebels againſt the Prince of life.—But remember, if you are yet in your ſins, I ſay unto you, as the Apoſtle Peter ſaid to the Jews, "Repent ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and be converted that your ſins may be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord." God is calling by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by death and judgments, and yet I fear, you ſit ſtill, and trifle away your time. What do you mean, what do you think of the world? It is paſſing away, its pleaſures are fading, its honours are
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:036848_0039_100B2208A3B72870"/>
leaving you, its profits will prove unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to you—heaven or hell are a little before you. God is juſt and jealous, his threatnings are true—the great day of his judgment will be terrible, your time runs on, your lives are uncertain—I fear, ſome of you are far behind hand—you have loitered long—you are ſtrangers to God:—you are hardened in all evil cuſtoms—have you any aſſurance of comfort to ſhew, if you die tomorrow: are you rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy—(is the love of God in you) if not, with what terror will your ſouls go out of your bodies? God ſtandeth all this while waiting your leiſure—his patience beareth, his juſtice forbeareth, his mercy entreateth you.—Chriſt ſtandeth offering you his blood and merits, you may have him freely—O! take warning in time—Remember, if he is not your prince to reign over you, and in you, he will laugh at your calamity—and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> mock when your fear cometh, when your fear cometh as a deſolation, and your deſtruction as a whirlwind—when diſtreſs and anguiſh cometh upon you.—Remember what a nation you live in—you have the light of the glorious Goſpel
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:036848_0040_100B220AC8BEEFF8"/>
of Chriſt—Let your prayer be like the blind man: "Thou Son of God, have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on me." If you turn unto God, you will be good Citizens here and reign with your Prince the King of Kings, in glory; which may God Grant, Amen.—</p>
