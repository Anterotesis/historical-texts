            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>Be not drunk with Wine, wherein is Exceſs; but be filled with the Spirit.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Perſons to whom theſe Words were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, were the People of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> who being, as we are told in the <hi>Acts,</hi> Worſhippers of the great Goddeſs <hi>Diana,</hi> in all Probability worſhipped the God <hi>Bacchus</hi> alſo: at the Celebration of whoſe Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals, it was always cuſtomary, nay, Part of their Religion, to get drunk; as though there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Way to pleaſe their God, but by turning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Brutes.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle therefore, in this Chapter, amongſt many other precepts more eſpecially applicable to them, lays down that in the Text; and exhorts them, as they had now, by the free Grace of God, been turned from heatheniſh Darkneſs to the Light of the Goſpel, to walk as Children of Light, and no longer make it Part of their Religion or Practice to be drunk with Wine, wherein is Exceſs; but, on the contrary, ſtrive to be filled with the Spirit of that Saviour, after whoſe Name they were now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and whoſe Religion taught them to abſtain from ſuch a filthy Sin, and to live ſoberly as they ought to live.</p>
            <p>By the World being now Chriſtian, and the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the Goſpel every where received, one would imagine, there ſhould be no Reaſon for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the Precepts now before us. But alas, Chriſtians! I mean Chriſtians falſly ſo called, are ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004640_0003_100DB5DCE656ED18"/>
Drunkenneſs in particular, that was <hi>St. Paul</hi> to riſe again from the dead, he might be tempted to think moſt of us were turned back to the Worſhip of dumb Idols; that we had ſet up Temples in Honour of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>; it Part of our Religion, as the <hi>Epheſians</hi> did of theirs, <hi>to be drunk with Wine, wherein is Exceſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our civil Magiſtrates have not been wanting to uſe the Power given them from above for the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Reſtraint of ſuch evil Doings; and I wiſh it could be ſaid this Plague of Drinking, by what they have done, had been ſtayed amongſt us. But alas! though their Labour, we truſt, has not been altogether in vain in the Lord, yet thouſands, and I could almoſt ſay, ten thouſands fall daily at our Right Hand, by this Sin of Drunkenneſs, in our Streets; nay, Men ſeem to have made a Covenant with Hell, and though the Power of the civil Magiſtrate is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted againſt them; nay, and though they cannot but daily ſee the Companions of their Riot hourly by this, brought to the Grave, yet they <hi>will riſe up early to follow ſtrong Drink, and cry, To Morrow ſhall be as to Day, and ſo much the more abundantly; when we awake, we will ſeek it yet again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is high Time therefore, for thy Miniſters to life up their Voices like a Trumpet, and ſince human Threats cannot prevail, to ſet before them the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Lord, and try if theſe will not perſuade them to ceaſe from the Evil of their Doings.</p>
            <p>But alas! how ſhall I addreſs my ſelf to them? I fear Exceſs of Drinking has made them ſuch meer <hi>Nabals,</hi> that there is no ſpeaking to them. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of God's Servants have toiled all their Lifetimes in diſſuading them from this Sin of Drunkenneſs, yet they will not forbear. However, at his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004640_0003_100DB5DCE656ED18"/>
I will ſpeak alſo, though they be a rebellious Houſe. Magnify thy Strength, O Lord, in my Weakneſs, and grant that I may ſpeak with ſuch Demonſtration of the Spirit, and with Power, that from henceforward they may ceaſe to act ſo unwiſely, and this Sin of Drunkenneſs may not be their Ruin.</p>
            <p>Believe me, ye unhappy Men of <hi>Belial</hi> (for ſuch, alas! this Sin has made you) it is not without the ſtrongeſt Reaſons, as well as utmoſt Concern for your precious and immortal Souls, that I now conjure you, in the Apoſtles Words, <hi>Not to be drunk with Wine, or any other Liquor, wherein is Exceſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Drunkenneſs is a Sin which muſt be highly diſpleaſing to God; becauſe it is an Abuſe of his good Creatures.</p>
            <p>When God firſt made Man, and had breathed into him the breath of Life, he gave him Dominion over the Works of his Hands, and every Herb bearing Seed, and every Tree, in which was the Fruit of a Tree yielding Seed, to him it was given for Meat; but when <hi>Adam</hi> had taſted the forbidden Fruit, which was the only Reſtraint laid upon him, he forfeited this Priviledge, and had no Right, ſince he had diſobeyed his Creator, to the Uſe of any one of the Creatures.</p>
            <p>But, bleſſed be God, this Charter, as well as all other Priviledges, is reſtored to us by the Death of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> our Lord and Maſter <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Of every Beaſt of the Field, every Fiſh of the Sea, and whatſoever flieth in the Air, or moveth on the Face of the Earth, that is fit for Food, we may free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eat, <hi>i. e.</hi> without Scruple take, and eat; but then, with this Limitation, that we uſe them moderately. For God, by the Death of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> has given no Man
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004640_0004_100DB5DEA64178E8"/>
Licenſe to be intemperate; but, on the contrary, has laid us under the ſtrongeſt Obligations to live ſoberly, as well as godly, in this preſent World.</p>
            <p>But the Drunkard, deſpiſing the Goodneſs and Bounty of God, in reſtoring to us what we had ſo juſtly forfeited, turns his Grace into Wantonneſs; and as though the Creature was not of itſelf enough ſubject to Vanity, by being Curſed for our Sakes, he abuſes it ſtill more, by making it adminiſter to his Luſts; and turns that Wine which was intended to make glad his Heart, into a deadly Poiſon.</p>
            <p>But thinkeſt thou, O Drunkard, whoſoever thou art, thou ſhalt eſcape the righteous Judgment of God? No, the Time will ſhortly come that thou muſt be no longer Steward, and then the ſovereign Lord of all the Earth will reckon with thee for thus waſting his Goods. Alas! wilt thou then wreſt Scripture any longer to thy own Damnation? And becauſe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> turned Water into Wine at the Marriage Feaſt, to ſupply the Wants of his indigent Hoſt, ſay, that it is therefore meet to make merry, and be drunken. No, thou ſhalt be ſilent before him; and know, that tho' thou haſt encouraged thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Drunkenneſs by ſuch like Arguments, yet for all theſe Things God will bring thee into Judgment.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> What makes Drunkenneſs more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſinful, is, that a Man, by falling into it, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth againſt his own Body!</p>
            <p>When the Apoſtle would diſſuade the <hi>Corinthians</hi> from Fornication, he urges this as an Argument, <hi>Flee Fornication,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Brethren; for he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth Fornication, ſinneth againſt his own Body.</hi> And may not I as juſtly cry out, Flee Drunkenneſs, my Brethren, ſince he that committeth that Crime,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004640_0004_100DB5DEA64178E8"/>
ſinneth againſt his own Body? For, from whence come ſo many Diſeaſes and Diſtempers in you Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: Come they not from hence, even from your Intemperance in drinking? Who hath Pains in the Head? Who hath Rottenneſs in the Bones? Who hath Redneſs of Eyes? He that tarries long at the Wine, he that riſes early to ſeek new Wine. How many walking Skeletons have you ſeen, whoſe Bodies were once exceeding fair to look upon, fat, and well favoured; but, by this Sin of drinking, how has their Beauty departed from them, and how have they been permitted to walk to and fro upon the Earth, as though God intended to ſet them up, as he did <hi>Lot'</hi>s Wife, for Monuments of his Juſtice, that others might learn not to get drunk? Nay I appeal to yourſelves. Are not many, for this Cauſe, even now ſickly among you? And have not many of your Companions whom you once ſaw flouriſhing, like green Bay Trees, been brought by it, with Sorrow, to their Graves?</p>
            <p>We might perhaps, think ourſelves hardly dealt with by God, was he to ſend to us, as he did to the royal Pſalmiſt, to chooſe one Plague out of three, whereby we ſhould be deſtroyed. But had the Almighty decreed to cut off Man from the Face of the Earth, and to ſhorten his Days, he could not well ſend a more effectual Plague than to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Men, as they pleaſed, to overcharge themſelves with Drunkenneſs; for though it be a ſlow, vet it is a certain Poiſon. And if the Sword has ſlain its thouſands, Drunkenneſs has ſlain its ten thouſands.</p>
            <p>And will not this alarm you, O ye Tranſgreſſors? Will not this perſuade you to ſpare yourſelves, and to do your Bodies no Harm? What, have you loſt the firſt Principles of human Nature, the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004640_0005_100DB5E319FCCD30"/>
Law of Self-preſervation? You ſeem to have a great Fondneſs for your Bodies, why otherwiſe to gratify their inordinate Appetites, do you drink to Exceſs? But ſurely, if you truly loved them, you would not thus deſtroy them; and was there no other Argument to be urged againſt Drunkenneſs, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that it will deſtroy thoſe Lives you are ſo fond of, one would imagine, ſhould be ſufficient.</p>
            <p>I know, indeed, that it is a common Anſwer that Dru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kards make to thoſe, who, out of Love, would pull them as Firebrands out of the Fire "We are no Body's Enemy but our own." But this, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being an excuſe for, is but an Aggravation of their Guilt: For (not to mention that the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs of one Man has c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>pting his Neighbour alſo) I ſay, not to mention theſe, and many other ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, which would prove ſuch an Excuſe to be entirely falſe; yet what is dearer to a Man than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? And if he himſelf be loſt, what would all the whole World avail him? But how wilt thou ſtand. O Man, before the Judgment-Seat of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and make ſuch an Excuſe, when thou ſhalt be arraigned before him as a Self-Murderer? Will it then be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, thinkeſt thou, to ſay, <hi>I was no Man's Enemy but my own?</hi> No; God will then tell thee, that thou waſt not thy own; that thou waſt bought with the Price of his dear Son's Blood, and thou oughteſt therefore to have glorified him with thy Spirit, and with thy Body, which were his. And ſince thou haſt, by Intemperance, deſtroyed thy Body, he will deſtroy both thy Body and Soul in Hell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:004640_0005_100DB5E319FCCD30"/>
But, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What renders Drunkenneſs more inexcuſible, is, that it robs a Man of his Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Reaſon is the Glory of a Man; the chief Thing whereby God has made us to differ from the Brute Creation. And our modern Unbelievers have exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to ſuch a high Degree, as even to ſet it in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Revelation, and deny the Lord that bought them. But though in doing this, they great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly err, and whilſt they profeſs themſelves wiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come real Fools; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The very Heathen Kings were ſo ſenſible of this, that, in order to deter their young Princes from drinking, they uſed to make their Slaves get drunk, and be expoſed before them. And didſt thou but ſee thine own Picture, O Drunkard, when, after having drowned thy Reaſon, thou ſtaggereſt to and fro, like one of the Fools in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſeeſt thy very Companions making Songs upon thee, ſurely thou wouldſt not return to thy Vomit again, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor thyſelf in Duſt and Aſhes?</p>

How glorious does he, that was made a little lower than the Angels, look to Day, when unmindful of his Dignity, he has, by drinking, robbed himſelf of his Reaſon, and reduced himſelf to a Level with the Beaſts that periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what if God, in the midſt of one of theſe drunken Fits, ſhould arreſt thee by Death, and ſay unto thee <hi>Thou Fool, this Moment ſhall thy Soul be required of thee.</hi> Oh! How wouldſt thou appear in thoſe filthy Garments before that God, in whoſe Sight the Heavens are not clean. And how know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou, O Man, but this may be thy Lot?

No, this is rather a Sign that he will come at an Hour thou lookeſt not for him; and ſince his Goodneſs and Long-Suffering has not led thee to Repentance, he will cut thee down, and not permit thee to cumber the Ground any longer.

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004640_0006_100DB5E4B25FEB78"/>
looked in <hi>Hazael'</hi>s Face, forbear weeping, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how many Vices he may fall into, ere he comes to himſelf again.</p>
            <p>What horrid Inceſt did righteous <hi>Let</hi> commit with his own Daughters when they had made him drunk? And, I doubt not, but there are many amongſt you, who have committed ſuch Crimes when you have deprived yourſelves of your Reaſon by drinking; that were you to hear of them, your Heart, like <hi>Nabal'</hi>s, after he was told how he had abuſed <hi>David</hi> when he was drunk, would die within you. And had any one told you, when you were ſober, hat you would have been guilty of ſuch Crimes, you would have cried out, with <hi>Hazael</hi> before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Are thy Servants ſo many Dogs, that they ſhould do thus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But no marvel that Drunkards commit ſuch Crimes: For Drunkenneſs drives the Holy Spirit from them; they become meer Machines for the Devil to work up to what he pleaſes; he enters into them, as he entered into the Herd of Swine; and no Wonder if they then commit all Uncleanneſs, and any other Crime, with Greedineſs. But this leads me to a</p>

               <hi>Fifth</hi> Conſideration, which highly aggravates the Sin of Drunkenneſs, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That it ſeperates the holy Spirit from us.</p>
            <p>It is to be hoped, that no one here preſent need be informed, that before we can be Chriſtians indeed, we muſt receive the Holy Ghoſt, muſt be born again from above, and have the Spirit of God witneſſing with our Spirits, that we are the Sons of God. This, this alone is true Chriſtianity; and without the Cohabitation of this Bleſſed Spirit in our Hearts,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004640_0007_100DB5E6796CB6D0"/>
our Righteouſneſs does not exceed the Righteouſneſs of the <hi>Scri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and we ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>But now, Drunkards do, in Effect, bid this Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit depart from them: For what has he to do with ſuch filthy Swine? No, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> no Lot or Share in the Spirit of the Son of <hi>David.</hi> They have chaſed him our of their Hearts, by defiling his Temple; I mean their Bodies. And he can no more hold Communion with them, than Light can have Communion with Darkneſs, or <hi>Chriſt</hi> have Concord with <hi>Belial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle therefore, in the Words of the Text, exorts the <hi>Epheſians, not to be drunk with Wine, wherein is Exceſs, but to be filled with the Spirit;</hi> thereby implying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Drunkenneſs and the Spirit of God could never dwell in the ſame Heart. And in another Epiſtle, he bids them <hi>avoid unprofitable Converſation, as a Thing which grieved the Holy Spirit; whereby alone they could be ſealed to the Day of Redemptions.</hi> And if unprofitable Converſation grieves the Holy Spirit, at what an infinite Diſtance muſt Drunkenneſs drive him from the Hearts of Men?</p>
            <p>But oh that you were wiſe! That you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what a dreadful Thing it is to have the Spirit of the living God depart from you: For, aſſure yourſelves, if you live without him, you live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the World. You are in the ſame miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able forlorn Condition as <hi>Saul</hi> was, when an evil Spirit of the Lord came upon him; and you are only ſo many Veſſels of Wrath fitted for Diſtruction. But this brings me to the</p>

               <hi>Sixth</hi> and laſt Reaſon I ſhall urge againſt the Sin of Drunkenneſs, that it abſolutely unfits a Man for the Enjoyment of God in Heaven, and expoſes him to his Eternal Wrath.</p>
            <p>To ſee and enjoy God, and to be like the bleſſed Angels, always beholding the Face of our Heavenly Father, in the Glories of his Kingdom, is ſuch an unſpeakable Happineſs, that even wicked Men, though they will not live the Life of the Righteous, cannot but wiſh their future State to be like his.</p>
            <p>But think you, O ye Drunkards, that you ſhall ever be Partakers of this Inheritance with the Saints in Light? Do you flatter yourſelves, that you, who have made them often the Subject of your drunken Songs, ſhall now be exalted to ſing with them the Heavenly Songs of <hi>Sion?</hi> No, as by Drunkenneſs you have made your Hearts Cages of unclean Birds, with impure and unclean Spirits muſt you dwell.</p>
            <p>A burning <hi>Tophet,</hi> kindled by God's Wrath, is prepared for your Reception, where you muſt ſuffer the Vengeance of an eternal Fire, and in vain cry out for a Drop of Water to cool your Tongues. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you ſhall drink, but it ſhall be a Cup of God's Fury: For in the Hand of the Lord, there will be a Cup of Fury, it will be full mixed; and as for the Dregs thereof, all the Drunkards of the Land ſhall ſuck them out.</p>
            <p>But perhaps you may not believe this Report. Theſe Words may be looked upon by you as idle Tales, and I may ſeem to you as <hi>Lot</hi> did to his Sons-in-Law, when he came to warn them to get up out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> as one that mocketh. But if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not me, believe eternal Truth itſelf, and he has poſſitively declared, that no Drunkard ſhall ever enter into his Kingdom.</p>

            <p>But, Lord, has no one believed our Report? Wilt thou ſuffer ſo many Words to be ſpoken in vain, if it be yet in vain? No, methinks I ſee ſome prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Heart, and ready to cry out in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Abigail, Bleſſed be the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which ſent thee this Day to ſpeak unto us. For ſurely, unleſs he had ſent thee, this Sin of Drunkenneſs had been our Ruin.</hi> But, now, ſince we find whither it will lead us, we are reſolved to drink no Liquor to Exceſs while the World ſtands, leſt we ſhould be tormented in the Flames of Hell.</p>
            <p>But alas! how ſhall we be delivered from the Power of this Sin? Can the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots? So hard, almoſt, will it be for us who have been accuſtomed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate, to learn to live ſober.</p>

though for this Sin of Drunkenneſs, he might juſtly turn away his Face from you; yet if you pour out your Hearts before him in daily Prayer, and ask Aſſiſtance from above, he will endue you with Power from on high, and make you more than Conquerors through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> that loved you. Had you kept up Communion with him in Prayer, you would not ſo long, by Drunkenneſs, have had Communion with Devils. And had you beſought him inſtantly, that you might not be led into Temptation, you would always have been delivered from the Evil of it. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>But think not that God muſt do all, and you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. No; as we <hi>can</hi> do nothing without him, ſo he <hi>will</hi> do nothing without us. And if we pray that we may not be led into Temptation, we muſt take heed not to throw ourſelves into it.</p>

And here, by way of Concluſion to this Diſcourſe, I cannot but exhort all Perſons, high and low, rich and poor, one with another, to practice a ſtrict Self-denial in eating and drinking. For though the Kingdom of God conſiſts not in Meats and Drinks, yet an abſtemious Uſe of, and a frequent total Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from God's good Creatures, are great Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ſpiritual Life. And perhaps there are more deſtroyed by living in a regular Senſuality, than even by that very Sin I have now been warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you of.—I know, indeed, that many, who are only almoſt Chriſtians, and who ſeek, but do not ſtrive to enter into the Kingdom of God, urge a Text of Scripture to juſtify their Indulgence, ſaying, <hi>That it is not what entreth into the Man defileth the Man.</hi> And ſo we grant, when taken moderately; but then they ſhould conſider, that it is poſſible, nay, it is proved by daily Experience, that a Perſon may eat and drink ſo much as not to hurt his Body, and yet do infinite Prejudice to his Soul. For Self-indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence lulls the Soul into a ſpiritual Slumber, as well as direct Intemperance; and though the latter may expoſe us to more Contempt among Men, yet the former, if continued in, will as certainly ſhut us out from the Preſence of God. St. <hi>Paul</hi> knew this full well; and therefore, tho' he was the ſpiritual Father of thouſands, and was near upon finiſhing his Courſe, yet he ſays, it was his daily Practice to keep his Body under, and bring it into Subjection, no doubt, by a ſtrict Abſtinence and Faſting; not that he might arrive at higher Degrees of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but leſt after he had preached to others, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhould be a Caſt-away. But why urge I the Apoſtle's Example to excite you to a ſtrict Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in eating and drinking? Rather let me exhort
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004640_0010_100DB5ECD0EE1B40"/>
you only to put in Practice the latter Part of the Text, <hi>to labour to be filled with the Spirit of God,</hi> and then you will no longer ſearch the Scriptures to find Arguments for Self-Indulgence; but you will deal ſincerely with yourſelves, and faſt as often as the Church enjoyns, if your Healths will permit; and eat and drink no more at any Time, than what is conſiſtent with the ſtricteſt Precepts of the Goſpel. Oh do but beg of God, that you may ſee how you are fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> and muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ere you can be happy, by the Spirit of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt!</hi> Let us beſeech him to enlighten us, to ſee the Treachery of our corrupt Hearts, and how pure and holy theſe Bodies ought to be, which are living Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, and then we ſhall ſhew ourſelves Men. Abſtain from all Appearance of any thing that will quench this holy Spirit, and do any Thing that will invite him into, or cauſe him to abide in our Hearts. And thus being made Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, by his dwelling in our Bodies here, though, after Death, Worms may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them; yet ſhall they be raiſed by the ſame Spirit at the general Reſurrection of the laſt Day, to be faſhioned like unto <hi>Chriſt'</hi>s glorious Body hereafter.</p>
