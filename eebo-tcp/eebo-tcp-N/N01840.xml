            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>For Rulers are not a terror to Good Works, but to the Evil.</q>
            </epigraph>

            <p>THE former part of the Epiſtle is Doctrinal; and it treats of the moſt important Doctrines of the Goſpel; as GOD'S eternal Purpoſe, Fore-knowledge, Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Vocation of Sinners into a State of Grace, their Juſtification there-upon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Doctrine of Juſtification is here very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and clearly handled, by the Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>THE latter part of the Epiſtle is Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Inſtructive of us as to variety of Duties to be done by us. Within this part falls this Chapter, and particularly this Text; <hi>For
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002180_0005_10030BB48F5B6968"/>
Rulers are not a terror to good works; but to the Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN v. 1. We have a Divine Command gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Mouth of an Apoſtle, <hi>viz. Let every Soul be ſubject unto the higher Powers. The Soul</hi> is here put for the Perſon, as frequently other-where in Scripture. <hi>Every Soul,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Perſons of all Ranks and Diſtinctions. <hi>Powers,</hi> are here intended of Civil Rulers; for the Apoſtle is not here treating of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government.</p>
            <p>OBEDIENCE to this Precept is here urged by weighty Reaſons. GOD made Man a Rational Being; and as ſuch He deals with him. He expects he ſhould be ſwayed by Reaſon; and accordingly he is hereby preſſed to his Duty.</p>
            <p>AND He tells us,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>THAT the Powers are of GOD.</hi> They are Ordained by Him, are Conſtituted by His Authority. And this ſhould certainly be of weight with Rational Beings, with every Man that owns a GOD, and himſelf to be His Creature, ſuſtained by Him every Moment, and deriving from Him every thing, every good thing that is injoyed by him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>THAT whoſoever reſiſts the Power, reſiſts the Ordinance of GOD.</hi> He does not ultimately
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002180_0006_1003015DE7428598"/>
reſiſt a Creature, but GOD Himſelf, while he reſiſts, or oppoſes himſelf againſt His Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. He wages War with GOD Himſelf. And what daring Madneſs is this in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! Who is, as we read, in Jer. 18.6. <hi>In GOD'S Hand as the clay is in the Potters hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>THAT they that reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation.</hi> A dreadful doom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! A ſtrong Motive it is to be ſubject to Government. Its the ſame word both in the Tranſlation and Original, which we read, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 29. reſpecting Perſons Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiving the Lords Supper. And tho' it be true that the word might be tranſlated, <hi>Judgment</hi>; its alſo true, That either of theſe Sins, with all others that Men are guilty of, or any particular Sin whatſoever; without Repentance, will iſſue in Damnation.</p>
            <p n="4">4.(WHICH brings me to my Text) he tells us, <hi>That Rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. q. d.</hi> Obey them, Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſubmit to their Authority and Rule; for tho' they be Men armed with the Sword of Civil Juſtice; they are only evil workers, vicious Perſons, to whom they are a terror. They will not hurt the good: No, their Power is, as is the Law, in 1 Tim. 1.9. <hi>Not againſt a Righteous Man, but againſt the Lawleſs, Diſobedient, Ungodly, Unholy, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002180_0007_10030BB72EC9EBA8"/>IN the Words of the Text we have,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>THE ſubject ſpoken of,</hi> viz. Rulers; Such to whom the Civil Government is by GOD committed; they are Rulers, Ruling in the Fear of GOD; Rulers in Scripture deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated gods. Pſal. 82.1. <hi>GOD judgeth among the gods</hi>: they are gods, as being cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with His Authority; gods, as bearing the lively Image of His own Impartiality, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, Juſtice, &amp;c. mixed with Lenity and Mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>WHAT is Predicated or Affirmed of them.</hi> They are a <hi>Terror.</hi> Their Countenances, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments, and Adminiſtrations carry a terror in them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>TO whom they are thus, or the objects of this Terror of theirs.</hi> And they are thus, (1) Negatively, Not to good works. Here works are put for Perſons working. Rulers are no terror to them that be honeſt and good; that do good &amp; work righteouſneſs. (2) Poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, They are a terror to evil works. <hi>i. e.</hi> To evil workers. Evil workers, Vicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, are they to whom they are a terror. Againſt theſe it is that the Point, of their Sword of Civil Juſtice is ſet. Immoral Men, Men of evil Practices, of wicked Lives, are the objects of their terror. Thus are <hi>Rulers a terror not to good works, but to the evil,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:002180_0008_100301608C2A5D58"/>
               <label>DOCTRINE.</label>
THEY are Evil Workers, Vicious Perſons, to whom Rulers are a Terror.</p>
            <p>TO theſe and only theſe, according to their Character in my Text, they are ſo. They are Evil Workers againſt whom their faces are ſet, and the edge of their Authority turned. They will not hurt the good: No, Rom. 13.3. <hi>Do good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of them.</hi> They will not diſcoutenance, but incourage the doing of Good. This you may expect; for we read in Rom. 13.4. <hi>The Civil Ruler is the Miniſter of GOD unto thee for good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR further Illuſtration of this Truth, I ſhall firſt lay down the following Poſitions; then Anſwer the Inquiry, <hi>viz.</hi> How, or in what way are Rulers a terror to Evil Workers, to Vicious Livers?</p>
            <p>POSITIONS.</p>
            <p>Poſition, 1. <hi>That RULE Originally belongs to GOD Only.</hi> The right of Rule is Primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alone in the Hand of the High and Lofty ONE, who inhabiteth Eternity. Even a proud and lofty ſpirited Heathen ſeems to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002180_0009_10030BB8DF76D710"/>
have been convinced of this, in Dan. 4.34—<hi>I praiſed and honoured Him that liveth for ever, whoſe Dominion is an everlaſting Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and his Kingdom from Generation to Generation.</hi> And it will come to that again, that all Rule ſhall be intirely in the Hand of the Great JEHOVAH. We read, in 1 Cor. 15.24. That the Great Mediator <hi>ſhall put down all Rule, Authority, and Power</hi>; and then <hi>ſhall deliver up the Kingdom to GOD.</hi> And v. 28. <hi>When all things ſhall be ſubdued unto the Son; the Son Himſelf ſhall be ſubject to Him that put all things under Him; that GOD may be all in all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Poſition, 2. <hi>RULE being a Communicable Property of GOD, it may be derived unto His Creatures.</hi> Creatures may by participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be inveſted with Rule and Government, which be Originally in GOD alone. As Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Juſtice, Goodneſs, &amp;c. are commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable Properties of GOD: ſo is Dominion alſo.</p>
            <p>Poſition, 3. <hi>IT was accordingly communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to</hi> Adam <hi>in Innocency.</hi> To him was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Dominion over every Sublunary Being. GOD cloathed him in a degree with His own Authority. Gen. 1.28. — <hi>Have Dominion over the Fiſh of the Sea, the Fowl of the Air, and over every living thing that moveth on the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002180_0010_10030163D6732970"/>
Earth.</hi> And in this Dominion ſeems the Image of GOD on <hi>Adam,</hi> in part to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted. It was indeed Righteouſneſs and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in which it principally did conſiſt; but not excluſive of Rule and Government, with which he was betruſted.</p>
            <p>Poſition, 4. <hi>A forfeiture was made by the fall of this as well as of all other good.</hi> Man by this Apoſtacy forfeited all his favours. He retained no title to any good at all; no right to any thing either profitable, pleaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, or honourable. To that deadly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated death only, now he had a title: Gen. 2.17. —<hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> He was now not only ſtript of his right to Rule, as well as other benefits: but his condition was much worſe than that of curſed <hi>Canaan,</hi> Gen. 9.25. <hi>A Servant of Servants ſhall he be unto his Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Poſition, 5. <hi>GOD by common favour, on the Revelation of the Goſpel, reſtored Rule in ſome degree to fallen Man.</hi> This is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably evident from Scripture. Not only Rule, but Rule by Divine appointment, now belongs to fallen Man; to ſome in one kind, to others in another; to ſome in one degree, to others in another. And this is among GODS com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon favours: it belongs to bad as well as good Men. Its no diſtinguiſhing Character

            <p>Poſition, 6. <hi>RULE is either common to Mankind in general; or appropriated more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly unto Some of them.</hi> Common Rule belongs to Men as Men reſpited from preſent Ruine, and allowed to continue for a time in the World; to an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>d, with reſpect to them. This every Man is in ſome degree a ſharer in. The reſtoration of this to Apoſtate Man, we have the account of, in Gen, 9.2. <hi>And the fear of you, and the dread of you, ſhall be upon every beaſt of the earth, &amp;c. Into your hand are they delivered.</hi> That Rule which is more Special, is either, (1) <hi>Natural,</hi> as that of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents reſpecting Children. They have a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, tho' a limitted right of dominion over them; and Children are accordingly under a Natural tie to yield Obedience. (2) <hi>Civil Rule,</hi> including in it that which is Military alſo. (3) <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> which is ſetled in and over the viſible Church by CHRIST, as the King and Head of it. Eccleſiaſtical Rulers before the Moſaick Law, were the Firſt-born of the Families. Under the Law the Stated Rulers of the Church were the Prieſts and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002180_0012_1003016C60474288"/>
Levites Since the Law, they are Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Paſtors and Teachers.</p>
            <p>BUT the Civil Rulers are they of whom my Text ſpeaks, and concerning whom it is affirmed; <hi>They are a Terror, not to good works,</hi> &amp;c. They are evil workers, vicious perſons, to be a terror unto whom theſe are conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by GOD. This by Divine appointment is their Office: And on this very thing they are to attend, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.6.</p>
            <p>
               <label>QUESTION.</label>
BUT how, or whereby do Rulers become a Terror to Evil Workers, to Perſons of Vicious Lives, and Practices?</p>
            <p>
               <label>ANSWER.</label>
THEY are and appear to be a Terror to evil workers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>BY their very Countenances and Grave deportments.</hi> Perſons of ill Manners and baſe Practices may read in the very Countenances of Rulers, their ill-reſentment of them. Even therein may be read their hatred of them that work iniquity. We read, in Prov. 25.23. <hi>The North wind driveth away rain, ſo does an angry countenance, a backbiting Tongue.</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:002180_0013_10030BC601CE76A0"/>
Backbiting Tongues, and other baſe Practices, have the countenances of Rulers ſet againſt them. Nor are their Grave deportments, in their daily Converſation, without uſe and ſervice this way.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>BY their manifeſt Averſion from Perſons of ill fame, and diſſolute Lives.</hi> They loath the practices of Vicious Perſons. As the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in Iſrael: Pſal. 26.5. <hi>They hate the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of evil-doers, and will not ſit with the wicked.</hi> They loath the works of them that turn aſide to Vicious Courſes. <hi>They are the faithful of the Land on whom they ſet their eyes</hi>; towards whom they manifeſt their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances favourable. Pſal. 101.3, 6. <hi>Nor will they know,</hi> with approbation, <hi>any wicked Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>BY Enacting Laws ſuited to the Suppreſſion of Immorality and Vice, and the incouragement of Equity and Virtue.</hi> The Laws of the Land ſhall be adapted by them to the great ends of incouraging them that do well, and the ſuppreſſion of evil Men, and evil Manners.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>BY looking diligently to the Execution of them.</hi> Rulers will carefully ſee to it that the Laws anſwer their proper end; that they be not wreſted by evil men, to ſerve baſe deſigns, nor the uſe of them fruſtrated by ſuch as Study how to evade their force.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:002180_0014_10030BC78DFAACA0"/>5. <hi>BY Rejecting with abhorrence, thoſe Men that would obtain, with Money, Places of Honour and Truſt.</hi> They will without any further inquiry determine ſuch Men unfit for any Publick Place or Station. Rulers know that its not <hi>Bribery</hi> but <hi>Virtue</hi> that makes Men ſit to repreſent, as Rulers do, the Perſon of the Son of GOD. Accordingly they will carefully avoid preferring Men to Publick Places, of baſe, fordid, ſelfiſh Spirits.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>BY throwing out of Place Officers that be evidently Unfaithful to their Truſt.</hi> They will hear their teſtimony againſt Immorality, by diſplacing Unfaithful Officers. The Publick ſhall know that they are not Abetters of any ſuch Men. In this way they will make it known that their Practice is agreeable to their Character in my Text. Immoral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhall be diveſted of their Offices, and diſmiſſed from their Places of Publick Truſt.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>BY appointing Perſons to keep Publick Houſes, who are themſelves a terror to ſensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, ſloathful, vile and baſe Men.</hi> They will pick our Men in Towns for that Place, that be Men of Honeſty and Courage; Men that hate gain by the Sins of other Men; Men that will carefully obſerve the Laws reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Taverns; that will diſcountenance Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwellers,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002180_0015_10030BCAEF7788F8"/>
and reſerve their Publick Houſes for ſuch for whom they are by Law deſigned, Men that regard the Intereſt of Religion, and prefer the Publick Weal above their Private Intereſt, ſhall be the Men for theſe betruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Indeed there are few Men in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, that have greater advantages, either to prevent, or promote the Ruine of this People, than Tavern-keepers have.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Laſtly, <hi>BY giving proper Incouragement, and ſuitable Support to the Goſpel-Miniſtry.</hi> The direct end of that is not only to terrifie Evil-workers; but to eradicate Original Sin it ſelf, from whence all evil works proceed. Its direct tendency is to beat down the Devils Kingdom, and raſe the very root of Actual Sin. Accordingly we read, as in Act. 26.18.—<hi>I ſend thee to open mens eyes, to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan to GOD.</hi> Thus runs the Commiſſion given to the Goſpel Miniſtry. So in 2 Cor. 10.4. <hi>The weapons of our Warfare are not carnal, but mighty thro' GOD, for the pulling down of ſtrong holds.</hi> Theſe ſtrong holds are the obſtinate Wills of deeply depraved Men: and for the breaking down of theſe, to a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to GOD's righteouſneſs, is the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Miniſtry appointed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:002180_0016_10030BD26A0B7938"/>THE great end of Civil Government is, to reſtrain Mens Corruptions, to prevent Sin from breaking out to that degree to deluge the World; to damm up its Streams, that they may not as a mighty Torrent, carry all before them. This is the great end of Civil Laws, Penalties annexed to them, Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted on Malefactors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe things are appointed of GOD as means to reſtrain Mens exorbitant Luſts.</p>
            <p>BUT the tendency of the Goſpel-Miniſtry is, to kill the very root of Sin; to heal the depraved Natures of Men that be tainted and poiſoned with it. It tends indeed to curb their Luſts, and keep them from being ſo Vicious and Prophane, as otherwise they would; but its alſo appointed as a Means to heal their wretched Natures, and cure them of their Heart-plagues.</p>
            <p>RULERS will accordingly ſee to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and Support of the Goſpel-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. This ſurely they will do, as knowing that in this way they are a Terror to evil workers.</p>
            <p>AND they will do it,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>BY promoting Learning in the Tongues and Arts.</hi> They know that ſuch Learning is
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002180_0017_10030BD440DC5E10"/>
highly needful to qualifie Perſons for the Miniſtry; and that our Fathers that ſetled this Country, even in the Infancy and Poverty of it, were accordingly at charge to erect a College for Education, beyond what was to be had in Grammar Schools.</p>
            <p n="2">2. BY diſcountenancing the folly of People in Chooſing Miniſters according to their vain Fancies, without regard either to the Civil Law, or Scripture-qualifications.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>BY taking care that Miniſters be not Neceſſitated to leave their Studies, to prevent the Starving of their Families.</hi> And on this I may preſume, as concluding it well known to our Rulers. (1) <hi>That the Goſpel Miniſtry ought to be Maintained, and that honourably by the People. The Lord has ordained that they that Preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.14. He wills, that while People par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of their Spiritual Things, they ſhould partake of their Carnal things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11. And declares it reaſonable from the very light of Nature, and uſage of Nations, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. (2) <hi>Conſequently, that People ordinarily, are able to Maintain the Miniſtry among them.</hi> Being commanded ſo to do, they have ability there-unto. Were it not thus, certainly ſuch a Precept had never been given them of GOD. It is true, that reſpecting ſome Spiritual
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002180_0018_10030174CA91BBF8"/>
duties required of Men, we can't argue from the Command, an ability to obey: but reſpecting any external acts of Obedience, the argument ſeems to be ſtrong, from GOD's Precept, to argue ability in People to yield Obedience. Accordingly, People ordinarily are able to Maintain and that decently and honourably, the Goſpel-Miniſtry among them. (3) <hi>That People do not ordinarily thus Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it.</hi> I ſpeak not this to reflect on any Place or People: but I take it to be evident to Judicious Rulers, that thus it is. (4) <hi>That GOD has authorized them to ſee that Juſtice be herein done to the Miniſtry.</hi> And, (5) <hi>That it will be for the Intereſt of People themſelves, that their Miniſters have juſt dealing in this regard from them.</hi> Rulers know that this will tend not to their Poverty, but their Proſperity. Sure I am that the Scripture thus affirms. Prov. 3.9, 10. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy ſubſtance, and with the firſt fruits of all thy increaſe. So ſhall thy barns be filled with plenty,</hi> &amp;c. Mal. 3.10. <hi>Bring ye all the tithes in to the Store-houſe, that there may be Meat in mine houſe; and prove me now here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, if I will not open you the windows of Heaven, and pour you out a bleſſing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I paſs now to the Improvement of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:002180_0019_10030BDADDA06190"/>USE, I. Is by way of Caution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT abſolute perfection be not expected from any Order of Men whatſoever.</hi> We are not in the State of Innocency, with <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall. Nor do we live among the Stars, where the proper Orbs are kept, and all the Motions regular. We live in a Curſed, and a Wicked World. Sin and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, darkneſs and error have infeſted every Society of Men. Rulers, whither Civil or Eccleſiaſtical; People, whither in the State or Church, labour under the deadly fruits of the firſt Apoſtacy. There is not a Perſon among us, but often wanders out of his way. Jam. 3.2. <hi>In many things we all offend.</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Perfection then, is not to be expected among us. Nor ought it to be a ſtumbling-block to any, that it is not found.</p>
            <p>THERE was not unmixed Equity in the Civil State, no, not in <hi>Solomons</hi> time. Eccl. 3.16. <hi>I ſaw under the Sun the place of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that wickedneſs was there, and the place of righteouſneſs, that iniquity was there.</hi> Nor are all things right in the Eccleſiaſtick Polity in any Age; whither among Paſtors, or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Rulers, or Ruled. Nor may it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected while the word holds good, in Jer. 17.9. <hi>The heart of man is deceitful above all
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002180_0020_10030BE288F25FF0"/>
things, and deſperately wicked.</hi> Indeed that word, if duely thought of, will ſtain the Pride of all humane glory; and lay every Man, from the King on the Throne, to the Beggar in the Street, in the duſt, before GOD.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, People, through Ignorance and want of Judgment, may think that amiſs in Rulers, which indeed is not ſo. Acts of Rulers may be ſometimes ill reſented, for want of knowing the true ground and reaſon of them.</p>
            <p>AND again, Errors in Government may oft proceed from the Iniquities of People, as the moral cauſe thereof. If that be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times true, <hi>Delirant Reges, plectuntur Ach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>i</hi>; that is infallibly true, in Prov. 28.2. <hi>For the tranſgreſſion of a Land, many are the Princes thereof.</hi> And ſo as to other afflictive evils relating to Government.</p>
            <p>USE, II. Is of Inſtruction &amp; Exhortation.</p>
            <p>ARE Rulers a Terror to evil Workers: Then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>WHAT will GOD Himſelf, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the World be? He is the Judge of all the Earth,</hi> Gen. 18.25. <hi>Juſtice and Judgment are the habitation of his Throne.</hi> And what will
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002180_0021_10030BE44C17B018"/>
become of wicked-workers then, when they fall into His Hand? That will be found a ſolemn Truth, in Heb. 10.31. <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living GOD.</hi> It were much better for wicked men never to have been born, than thus to fall into the Hands of this GOD.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>RULERS then are a great bleſſing to a wretched World.</hi> Were not evil-workers terrified by Rulers, the World would ſoon be Uninhabitable. Men would not be able to live one among another. They would be in an higher degree than now they are, as deſcribed in Hab. 1.14. <hi>As the Fiſhes of the Sea, devouring one another.</hi> Tyranny its ſelf is leſs bad than Anarchy. But Rulers ruling in the fear of GOD, are indeed great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. Unto their Rule, under GOD, is the Peace and Tranquillity of a People very much owing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>OUR Rulers then, will mind their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, given in my Text.</hi> Its the inſpired Apoſtle that ſaith, <hi>Rulers are a Terror to evil works.</hi> A great part of this Aſſembly are Rulers. Will each One ever bear in Mind, ever make proper and beneficial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on this their Character; <hi>Rulers are a Terror, not to good, but to evil works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:002180_0022_10030BE940D057F0"/>4. <hi>THANK we GOD for Rulers.</hi> Let them be accounted among the rich, tho' but common bleſſings of a Land. Rulers ruling in the fear of G0D; doing Juſtice &amp; Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſeeking the wealth of their People, are a great and a rich bleſſing. <hi>Theſe are the Shields of the Earth,</hi> Pſal. 47.9. <hi>They bear up the Pillars of a Land,</hi> as in Pſal. 75.3. What a Chaos of confuſion, and field of blood would the World preſently be, were it not for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Let Rulers then be acknowledged as great bleſſings to our Land.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>LET all Pray for them, that they may ever be a Terror to evil-workers.</hi> This is the Preceptive Will of GOD, in 1 Tim. 2.2. <hi>Let Prayer be made for Kings, and for all that be in Authority.</hi> Hitherto few if any People in the World have been favoured by GOD, in reſpect of Government, as <hi>New-England</hi> has been. Let GOD be ſought, for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this Favour. And let none contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute by their ingratitude, to the forfeiture of it.</p>
            <p>I conclude only with two words, which have evidently much of awe and ſolemnity in them. And they are directed to the two conſtituent parts of this great Aſſembly, <hi>viz.</hi> Rulers, and Ruled, And,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:002180_0023_1003017ADA804188"/>1. WILL <hi>our Rulers think how they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the very Perſon of the Incarnate SON of GOD.</hi> That Sacred Perſon is verily repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by You. Its His Authority you are inveſted with; for He is not only the Head of the Church, <hi>but the head over all things to the Church,</hi> Eph. 1.22. All Power is given to Him as Mediator. And with His Kingly Power, by Participation, Civil Rulers are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted. On this account they are called <hi>gods,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.6.</p>
            <p>ITS true, it is ſo, and more than barely ſo, reſpecting Eccleſiaſtical Rulers: They alſo repreſent His very Perſon, and that not in one only, but in all His Offices, Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Prieſtly, and Kingly. I do not ſay, That they repreſent His perſon in all Parts of all His Offices, but in all His Offices. His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Office, they repreſent, in Speaking from GOD unto the People; His Prieſtly Office, in Praying for them; and His Kingly, in Ruling of them. Accordingly we read, as in Joh.20. 21. —<hi>As my Father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you.</hi> Heb. 13.17. <hi>Obey them that have the rule ever you.</hi> Mat. 28.19. <hi>Go and teach all Nations.</hi> James 5. 14. <hi>Let the Elders of the Church Pray for him.</hi> Thus do they repreſent the Perſon of CHRIST. Nor are their Commiſſions leſs Authentick, but leſs
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002180_0024_10030BEEB6E567E0"/>
Mediate from Soveraign Power, than thoſe of Them in Civil Government. And it may accordingly ſeem ſtrange, that any that be acquainted with the Bible, ſhould either in their Prints, or Practice, aſſign them their Place at the Peoples feet.</p>
            <p>But when Rulers, whither Civil or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick, think, whoſe glorious Perſon is repreſented by them, How ſolemn will be the thought! What awful impreſſions will it make on their Spirits! What manner of Perſons will they think themſelves obliged to be in an holy unblamable Conversation! None in the World are under ſuch ſolemn and ſtrong ties, as theſe, to regard &amp; obey that Precept, in Eph. 5.15. <hi>See then that ye walk circumſpectly.</hi> Beware of ſo much as a wry Step, left the infinite Perſon repreſented by you, be thereby reflected on, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured; leaſt His Great Name be blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by your means.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>LET People, who make the other conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent Part of this Aſſembly, regard you, Civil Rulers, as being of this Character.</hi> Know, that they repreſent the Perſon, and are cloathed with the Authority of GOD the SON. They are on this account termed, as in Psai. 82.6. <hi>The Children of the Moſt High.</hi> Thus then regard them, and deport your ſelves accordingly toward them. And,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:002180_0025_1003017F98F30A08"/>1. <hi>DO not conclude their acts in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be neceſſarily amiſs, becauſe you can't preſently ſee the ground and reaſon of them.</hi> Things done may be reaſonable, juſt and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, tho' every eye can't preſently diſcern the reaſonableneſs, equality, and juſtice of them.</p>
