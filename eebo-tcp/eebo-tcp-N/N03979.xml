         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE words were ſpoken of thoſe <hi>extraordinary miraculous</hi> gifts, which various perſons were endow'd with, for the good of the church, in its firſt and infant ſtate: But it is not my deſign to conſider the text in this view, but as it may, by way of accommodation, be applied to thoſe more <hi>common</hi> gifts, wherewith the miniſters of religion have, all along, been, and are, at preſent, furniſht, for the uſe of edification.</p>
            <p>The method I propoſe is this,</p>
            <p n="1">I. To take a view of theſe gifts in their <hi>diverſity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. To conſider them as all proceeding from one <hi>and the ſame</hi> SPIRIT, though they are thus diverſe.</p>
            <p n="3">III. To make ſome inquiry into the <hi>reaſons of this various diſtribution of theſe gifts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole will then be followed with a plain and faithful Application.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am, in the firſt place, to take a view of the <hi>gifts of miniſters in their diverſity.</hi> Says the apoſtle, <hi>there are
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004913_0004_100E2ABA679D5F68"/>
diverſities of gifts.</hi> And ſo great is this diverſity, that there are, perhaps, no two miniſters, but if you compare their gifts, you will find a manifeſt difference between them. Some have one gift, others another; ſome have more gifts, others fewer; ſome have greater gifts, others ſmaller: And among thoſe who excel in gifts, ſome excel in this gift, others in that, none in all; but he that excels moſt in one gift, is yet excelled by another, in ſome gift of another kind, as great and valuable.</p>
            <p>Some have the gift of applying to men's <hi>underſtandings.</hi> They have, in their own minds, a diſtinct perception of the truths of GOD and religion; and their talent lies, in a readineſs to ſet theſe truths in a ſtrong and clear light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others. A vein of ſound reaſoning runs thro' their diſcourſes. Their ſermons are well digeſted, and well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, and, in their general contexture, well adapted to inform the judgment, to open and enlarge the mind; and, in a word, to fill men with the knowledge of GOD's will, in all ſpiritual wiſdom and underſtanding. Such was the <hi>preaching</hi> of the <hi>great apoſtle of the Gentiles.</hi> He appears to have had an admirable gift in applying to the <hi>reaſon</hi> of men for their <hi>inſtruction in righteouſneſs.</hi> His <hi>writings,</hi> to be ſure, are all of them in the <hi>rational, argumentative</hi> ſtile; calculated, not only to convey truth into the mind, but to do this in a way accommodate to <hi>men,</hi> by laying before them the proper evidences of it. And his <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> was of the ſame kind. 'Twas an addreſs to men's underſtandings, in the way of <hi>reaſoning.</hi> Hence the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>acts of the apoſtles,</hi> when he would ſpeak of <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>preaching,</hi> expreſſes himſelf in that language, <note n="‖" place="bottom">Acts 18 <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>He</hi> REASONED <hi>in the ſynagogue.</hi> Agreable whereto is that obſervable remark, in the preceeding chapter, <note n="†" place="bottom">V. 2.</note> 
               <hi>And Paul,</hi>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> HIS MANNER WAS, <hi>went in unto them, and</hi>—REASON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED <hi>with them out of the ſcriptures.</hi> There never was a more <hi>cloſe, rationale, argumentative</hi> ſpeaker than the great St. <hi>Paul.</hi> It was his MANNER to REASON in his <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:004913_0005_100E2ABC094B70B8"/>
His chief <hi>natural talent</hi> ſeems to have lain this way. He had been caught up into the third heavens; and if any man, he who had been ſo exalted with revelations, might have ſpoken in raptures of zeal and flame: But <hi>his gift</hi> lay in addreſſing <hi>rather</hi> to the <hi>reaſon,</hi> than <hi>paſſions</hi> of men; leading them into a clear and comprehenſive knowledge of Divine things.</p>
            <p>And an excellent gift this is. 'Tis well adjuſted to the character of men whom it has pleaſed God to endow with <hi>reaſon</hi> &amp; <hi>underſtanding:</hi> Nor is there a gift, the due exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe whereof, will more powerfully tend to anſwer the deſign of making men wiſer and better, which ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be the great end of preaching.</p>
            <p>Others have the gift of <hi>moving the paſſions.</hi> Their voice is ſtrong, yet ſweet and pleaſant. They have got the art of pronunciaton, can agreably modulate their words: and together with a good elocution, they have a becoming geſture; their action is eaſy and natural, and their general air graceful. They have the gift of the tongue, the faculty of expreſſing themſelves in ſo engaging a manner, as to command the attention and affection of their hearers. This ſeems to have been the gift of the prophet <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> Hence he is ſaid to have been <hi>as a very lovely ſong of one that hath a pleaſant voice, and can play well on an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Ezek. 33.32.</note>: To be ſure, this was the gift of young <hi>Apollos.</hi> He is ſaid in the <hi>acts,</hi> to have been an <hi>eloquent man</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 18.24.</note>. i. e. a graceful ſpeaker, a man of an eaſy flow of words, one that could addreſs to his auditory in a moving manner. It was doubtleſs owing to this, the engaging way in which he ſpake of <hi>the things of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>and of the kingdom of</hi> CHRIST, that he had ſo many admirers in the city of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And a deſirable gift this is. It would not be miſpent labour, if miniſters took ſome pains to become poſſeſt of it. Not that 'tis poſſible, after the utmoſt pains, that all ſhould equally excel here; nature wont allow of it: but
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004913_0006_100E2AC1FB894D70"/>
there are no preachers, but might attain this gift, in a leſs or greater degree. And however, in it ſelf conſidered, it may be a gift leſs valuable than ſome others, yet there is no gift more recommending, or that will give what we ſay, the advantage of coming with more force, upon the <hi>paſſions</hi> of our hearers.</p>
            <p>And let me add here, 'tis very proper theſe ſhould be apply'd to. For the <hi>human paſſions</hi> are capable of ſerving many valuable purpoſes in religion, and may to good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage be excited and warmed: always provided, that they are kept under the reſtraints of <hi>reaſon</hi>; for otherwiſe they will ſoon run wild, and may make thoſe in whom they reign to do ſo too. <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>heat</hi> ſhould always go together; and if there be not ſome good proportion of the former, it will turn to little account, if there be ever ſo much of the latter.</p>
            <p>Some have the gift of <hi>touching the conſciences of ſinners.</hi> They can ſpeak in words of terror, and ſo ſpeak as to rouſe ſinners out of their ſecurity, and ſet them a thinking. They have a faculty at weilding the ſword of the Spirit; and it is, often, in their hands, like a <hi>ſharp two-edged ſword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, and of the joynts and marrow.</hi> This was the talent of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> the forerunner of our LORD. He came in <hi>the ſpirit and power of Elias.</hi> And that was the genius of his miniſtry, <hi>O ye generation of vipers! who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Now alſo the ax is laid to the root of the trees: and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and caſt into the fire. James the ſon of Zebedee,</hi> and <hi>John his brother,</hi> were poſſeſt of the like gift. They were therefore ſirnamed by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour †, BOANERGES, or SONS OF THUNDER. They had the faculty of thundering out the vengeance of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty GOD againſt impenitent Sinners: And they dealt much in this way; it was probably the burden of their preaching.</p>
            <p>And this alſo is a uſeful gift, if rightly managed. Says the inſpired <hi>Paul ‖, we perſuade men by the terrors of the</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:004913_0007_100E2AC3ACAE85B8"/>
LORD. And they area proper means of perſuaſion: To be ſure, they are propounded as ſuch in the goſpel; and ought, accordingly, to be diſplayed before ſinners. They ſhould be plainly and faithfully told of that wrath of God, which is revealed from heaven againſt ſuch perſons as they are; yea, that they are, in their preſent ſtate, under actual condemnation by the holy and righteous law of GOD, and in ſuch circumſtances, as that 'tis impoſſible but they ſhould be miſerable. And the terrors of GOD ought the rather to be ſet in array againſt them, becauſe it is, in this way, ordinarily, that ſinners are awakened out of their ſecurity, and put upon endeavours to get into a ſtate of ſafety re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting another world. It is, being <hi>moved with fear,</hi> that they commonly begin their flight from the wrath to come. But then, it ought to be conſidered, that <hi>hope</hi> is a very powerful ſpring of humane action as well as <hi>fear,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to as ſuch, every where in the goſpel. Not only is the danger, ſinners are in, opened to their view; but the help likewiſe a merciful GOD has provided for them, in the LORD JESUS CHRIST; and as much care is taken to encourage their <hi>hopes</hi> as to alarm their <hi>fears</hi>: And what may be worth our remark, it is by the <hi>mixt influence</hi> of theſe paſſions, that ſinners are effectually wrot upon to become true and real chriſtians. <hi>Fear</hi> without <hi>hope</hi> tends only to deſperation; nor will the ſinner ever ſuitably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to GOD for help, till he is encouraged to hope in his mercy thro' the LORD JESUS CHRIST. Both theſe principles therefore are to be addreſs'd to; and a great deal of wiſdom is neceſſary to direct us in our application to them, that they may not run People into the extreams of <hi>deſpair</hi> on the one hand; nor <hi>preſumption,</hi> on the other; but may jointly operate, in a powerful manner, to bring them to repentance and ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Others have the gift of <hi>ſpeaking comfortably to diſtreſt ſinners.</hi> Their words are meek and mild, full of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and compaſſion, and much ſavouring of that mercy which is the diſtinguiſhing glory of the goſpel. They have a dexterity in ſetting before the view of ſinners that
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004913_0008_100E2ACC3385BE38"/>
               <hi>loving-kindneſs of</hi> GOD <hi>in</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>which has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared towards man.</hi> They have a comprehenſive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that remedy GOD has provided for undone, miſerable ſinners, and their ſkill lies in making application of this remedy; which they are able to do, ſuting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of GOD to the particular caſes of thoſe, whoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes they are acquainted with. This was the gift of <hi>Joſes,</hi> who was therefore ſirnamed by the apoſtles <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Acts 4.36.</note>, which is, being interpreted, <hi>the ſon of conſolation.</hi> He was one "eminent for comforting the LORD's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſpeaking peace to wounded, troubled conſciences. He had an admirable felicity that way". And this was the gift of our bleſſed SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST: Not that he had not other gifts; for he was furniſht with every gift befitting a preacher of ſalvation; but he appears to have diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the exerciſe of this. He could indeed, as there was occaſion, ſpeak powerfully to the awakening of ſinners; and his preaching was ſometimes in this ſtrain; particularly, when he had to do with the <hi>ſcribes</hi> and <hi>phariſees.</hi> And never were the wo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of GOD denounced with ſuch awful ſolemnity, as when he uttered them againſt theſe accurſed hypocrites, as you may ſee in the 23d Chapter of <hi>Matthew's goſpel.</hi> But his preaching was more commonly in words of mildneſs. He rather <hi>drew</hi> than <hi>drove</hi> men to himſelf. That was the ſpirit of his diſcourſes, "Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy-laden, and I will give you reſt. Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out. If any man thirſt, let him come to me &amp; drink. How often would I have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered you, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye would not. O that thou hadſt known, even thou, in this thy day, the things of thy peace, but now are they hid from thine Eyes." Never was there the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of ſo much compaſſion to the ſouls of men, as in the preaching of the LORD JESUS CHRIST. He ſpake with love and pity, ſo as never man ſpake. The tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and weakeſt conſcience might have heard him without
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004913_0009_100E2ACEE233C878"/>
fear. He would not have <hi>broken the bruiſed reed, nor quenched the ſmoaking flax.</hi> He was indeed <hi>anointed to preach good tidings to the meek, he was ſent to bind up the broken-hearted, and to proclaim the acceptable year of the</hi> LORD. So it was propheſied of the MESSIAH by the prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſa. 6.1.</note>. And 'tis remarkable, our bleſſed SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, while a preacher on earth, took up the <hi>book of this prophet,</hi> and having read to the people the words of <hi>this propheſy,</hi> he <hi>preached</hi> to them, ſaying, <hi>this day is this ſcripture fulfilled in your ears</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Luk. 4.21.</note>.</p>
            <p>And there is not, perhaps, a more uſeful gift than this of being able to <hi>ſpeak comfortably to diſtreſt ſinners.</hi> They need the conſolations of GOD; and 'tis a great mercy, there are thoſe among the preachers of CHRIST, who have an aptneſs to make application of them to their ſouls. 'Tis true, great care ſhould be taken not to <hi>daub with untempered mortar,</hi> not to <hi>propheſie peace,</hi> when GOD has ſaid, <hi>there is no peace:</hi> And thoſe, who have ſkill in <hi>words of comfort,</hi> will be careful in this matter; and while they are ſo, no preachers are more ſerviceable; to be ſure, none are more like to the GREAT PREACHER <hi>of ſalvation,</hi> whoſe glory is was, to <hi>heal the broken in heart,</hi> and <hi>bind up their wounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>various</hi> are the gifts of miniſters. And I may add, their <hi>manner,</hi> in the exerciſe of theſe gifts, is as <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> as the gifts themſelves. Some ſpeak in lofty ſtrains of language, others in a more plain and familiar way; ſome are cloſe and connected in their diſcourſes, others more looſe and unconfin'd; ſome are flowing in their Style, others ſhort and ſententious: Some are all zeal and flame, others more calm and compos'd; ſome utter themſelves in thunder, others in a ſtill and ſmall voice; ſome are tender-hearted and affectionate, others appear more firm, and without much ſenſible emotion. But whatever variety there is in the gifts of miniſters,</p>
            <p n="11">
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:004913_0010_100E2AD3ED2C3968"/>II. It all proceeds, which was the ſecond thing, from <hi>one and the ſame</hi> SPIRIT. So ſpeaks the text, <hi>there are diverſities of gifts, but the ſame</hi> SPIRIT. And in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſes, theſe gifts are particularly repreſented in all that <hi>variety,</hi> in which they appeared in the firſt days of chriſtianity: Upon which, the <hi>apoſtle</hi> makes that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable remark in the 11th. V. <hi>But all theſe worketh that one and the ſelf-ſame</hi> SPIRIT; <hi>dividing to every man ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally as he will.</hi> 'Tis true, the gifts here ſpoken of were <hi>ſupernatural powers,</hi> ſuch as advanc'd human nature above it ſelf; enabling the perſons endow'd with them to think, and ſpeak, and act, <hi>ſo</hi> as it was impoſſible for any man to do, who was not, as they were, immediately inſpired by the HOLY GHOST. But <hi>common</hi> as well as <hi>miraculous</hi> gifts come down from him, who is the <hi>giver of every good and perfect giving.</hi> The <hi>ſelf-ſame</hi> SPIRIT endows mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters now, that did it in the primitive ſtate of the church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>manner</hi> in which they are furniſht with gifts may be different; but their gifts are ſtill <hi>his</hi>; the fruits of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> favour: He is the great Donor of them, in all their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, whether in <hi>themſelves,</hi> or the <hi>meaſures</hi> in which they are poſſeſt, or exercis'd.</p>
            <p>Moſt men, indeed, are too ready, when they obſerve the difference there is in the accompliſhments of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to overlook the hand of GOD herein, aſcribing it to the different advantages they have been favoured with, or the different improvements they have made under the ſame advantages: And theſe things, no doubt, have their operation, in the place of means, in order to this <hi>diverſity</hi> of endowments; but the <hi>Divine</hi> SPIRIT has, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the <hi>chief</hi> influence in this whole affair.</p>
            <p>'This <hi>ſolely</hi> from him, that miniſters receive, what we call, their <hi>natural parts.</hi> They are by him, as the GOD of <hi>nature,</hi> form'd, and ſent into the world with all their <hi>natural abilities,</hi> both for <hi>kind</hi> or <hi>degree</hi>: And ſome he endows with <hi>greater,</hi> others with <hi>ſmaller</hi> capacities; ſome with this turn of mind, others with that; ſome with a large and extended genius, others with a more contracted
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004913_0011_100E2AD8976E0C00"/>
one. And theſe <hi>natural gifts</hi> he <hi>divides ſeverally to every one,</hi> not according to <hi>their will,</hi> not with the concurrence of any power or endeavours of theirs, but according to <hi>his own ſovereign pleaſure.</hi> And 'tis obſervable, theſe <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent natural abilities,</hi> which are the gifts of GOD, in a ſenſe ſo free and abſolute, that miniſters contribute nothing at all to them, or the <hi>original ground</hi> of all that <hi>diverſity</hi> there ever appears in their endowments; and this, tho' they ſhould have the ſame education, and be placed under the ſame advantages, and make a like good uſe of them.</p>
            <p>Not that theſe <hi>natural gifts</hi> an't capable of <hi>improvement.</hi> They may, by uſe and exerciſe, under a proper regimen, be greatly ſtrengthened and enlarg'd, refin'd and brighten'd; but this makes a difference only in the <hi>meaſure</hi> of theſe gifts; they remain the ſame in <hi>kind,</hi> tho' different in the <hi>degree</hi> of their excellence. And yet even in reſpect of this <hi>acquir'd</hi> difference, there is more of the <hi>efficiency</hi> of GOD than we may generally imagine. For he it is that ſo diſpoſes things, in the courſe of his providential govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as that there ſhall be a concurrence of <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>ſmaller</hi> advantages for the improvement of the <hi>natural gifts,</hi> he has beſtowed upon thoſe, he intends to employ as his miniſters: And he may have a greater hand than we are commonly aware of, in influencing thoſe <hi>ſecret ſprings,</hi> which put them upon thoſe various degrees of <hi>active diligence</hi> in the uſe of <hi>theſe</hi> advantages, in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereto will be their acquirements.</p>
            <p>There is yet another way, wherein <hi>theſe gifts</hi> may be improved; and this is, by <hi>grace,</hi> which is the higheſt and moſt glorious improvement they are capable of. 'Tis by this they become animated with true chriſtian life and ſpirit; 'tis by this they are directed to a right <hi>manner</hi> of exerciſe, and to a good <hi>end</hi>; 'tis by this they are render'd moſt conſpicuous in themſelves, and moſt uſeful to the world. And need I ſay, that this improvement of theſe gifts, is, in the moſt proper ſenſe of all, to be aſcribed to the <hi>Divine</hi> SPIRIT? We all know, the appropriate Style of the SPIRIT <hi>of</hi> GOD, in the holy ſcripture, is that, the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004913_0012_100E2ADC4F83D510"/>
SPIRIT <hi>of</hi> GRACE. And he is the <hi>grand diſpenſer</hi> of the grace of GOD to fallen man. 'Tis his <hi>ſpecial</hi> office, in the oeconomy of man's redemption to ſanctify both mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and people, their gifts as well as hearts. And when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the gifts of miniſters are improved by ſanctifying grace, whether it be in a ſmaller or greater degree, 'tis his work; and we are taught, from the bible, to aſcribe it to him, and give him the glory of it.</p>
            <p>So that the endowments of miniſters, whether <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>acquired</hi>; acquired by <hi>education,</hi> or <hi>grace,</hi> are properly <hi>gifts,</hi> the effects of the free favour of GOD. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, in all that variety, in which we behold them, from the one immenſe SPIRIT, as the author of nature, the over-ruler of all things in the courſe of providence, or the diſpenſer of grace.</p>
            <p n="3">III. But I muſt now proceed, in the third place, to inquire into the <hi>reaſons of this various diſtribution of gifts to miniſters.</hi> And could no other account be given of the matter than that, <hi>even ſo Father, becauſe ſo it hath ſeemed good in thy ſight,</hi> it would be enough to ſatisfy every ſerious, pious mind: But we have no need, in this caſe, to recur to the <hi>abſolute ſovereignty</hi> of GOD; as though we were at a loſs, and could only ſay with the apoſtle, <note n="‖" place="bottom">Rom. 12.33.</note> 
               <hi>O the depth of the riches of the knowledge and wiſdom of GOD! How unſearchable are his judgments, and his ways paſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out?</hi> Several things lies open to view, as weighty reaſons of this various diſtribution of gifts. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>glory</hi> it reflects upon the <hi>Divine goodneſs.</hi> An illuſtrious diſplay is hereby made of this attribute of GOD. Had the gifts of miniſters been only few and ſmall, this would have argued goodneſs in GOD; how much more now he has beſtowed them in <hi>kinds</hi> ſo various, and in <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> ſo excellent? There is an admirable beauty in this variety; and the goodneſs that has effected it, ſhines forth with a glorious luſtre.</p>
            <p>Some, perhaps, may think, it would have been more for the glory of the Divine goodneſs, if all miniſters had been
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004913_0013_100E2ADFB2BC1150"/>
endowed with the ſame excellent gifts: And if the <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> of gifts was that only which reflected honour on the goodneſs, which beſtowed them, it might be thus; but it is far otherwiſe. 'Tis the glory of Divine goodneſs, in all its diſplays, to be under the direction of wiſdom, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence with holineſs and juſtice. And 'tis this that has made way for thoſe innumerable <hi>different</hi> beings, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely various capacities, and for infinitely various ends and uſes, that we behold in the creation. It would have been <hi>glorious goodneſs,</hi> if GOD had made all beings with equal perfection, and capable of equal degrees of happineſs; but the beauty of the univerſe would then have been loſt: To be ſure, there would not have been thoſe amazing contrivances of wiſdom, which now reflect a glory on all GOD's works of goodneſs. That goodneſs certainly ſhines brighteſt that beſtows its gifts, not always to the <hi>utmoſt,</hi> as it were, by neceſſity; but with tho't and deſign, &amp; ſo as ſhall beſt anſwer the wiſe intentions of their beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This is the beauty of the Divine goodneſs in all its gifts; and 'tis particularly ſo in thoſe conferred on miniſters. They are, by being various, much better adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſerve the great and wiſe ends of their being furniſht with them, than if they had been the ſame: Which leads me to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="2">2. How admirably well adjuſted this <hi>various diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of gifts is, to the <hi>various diſpoſitions</hi> of thoſe, for whoſe benefit they are deſigned. It is not for their own advantage only, but for the <hi>good of people,</hi> that God beſtows his gifts upon miniſters; and they are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſuited in that variety in which he beſtows them, to promote this merciful intention. There is an ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing difference in the natural make of people. Some are of one temper, others of another; ſome of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of ſoul, others of that. Some, from their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal frame are apt to be pleaſed with one way of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, others with another, others with another ſtill, and ſo on, according to the difference there is in that <hi>reliſh</hi> they bring into the world with them. The ſame gifts
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004913_0014_100E2AE2E74CB310"/>
in miniſters would not therefore be at all adjuſted to theſe various taſtes in people; for which reaſon a good God has been pleaſed to vary his gifts: And the variety in theſe gifts is admirably fitted to the variety of guſts in people; inſomuch, that every palate may be ſuited by ſome gift or other, whereby ſome miniſter or other is diſtinguiſhed. If ſome are apt to be wro't upon by that preaching, which has a tendency to let light into the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, there are gifts ſuited to ſuch a caſt of mind; if others are better pleas'd with an addreſs to their paſſions, there are gifts adapted to work upon theſe; if ſome muſt be alarm'd as with thundrings from <hi>Sinai,</hi> there are gifts form'd to ſuch a purpoſe as this; and if others muſt be drawn with the bands of love, in words of kindneſs and gentleneſs, there are gifts of this tendency alſo; And ſo whatever the diſtinguiſhing turn of mind is, it may be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among the preachers of ſalvation; ſome or other of them are bleſt with a gift anſwerable thereto.</p>
            <p>And this reaſon of the various diſtribution of gifts, <hi>it's falling in with the various diſpoſitions of people,</hi> is the reaſon not only ſuggeſted, but largely inſiſted on in my <hi>context.</hi> The <hi>apoſtle</hi> here compares the <hi>church of</hi> GOD to an <hi>humane body,</hi> and the ſeveral gifts beſtowed for its edification to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious members of this body; all which have their uſe, and are neceſſary in their place: And tho' ſome are more excellent, and ſerve to a better uſe than others, yet all are ſerviceable; inſomuch, that no one can complain of the other, and ſay, <hi>I have no need of thee</hi>: And 'tis by the united influence of theſe various members, ſo variouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and ſerving to ſuch various purpoſes, that the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences of the body, are, in the beſt manner provided for. The <hi>apoſtle's</hi> words are theſe, "The body is not one member, but many. If the foot ſhall ſay, becauſe I am not the hand, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body? And if the ear ſhall ſay, becauſe I am not the eye, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body? If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the ſmelling? But
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004913_0015_100E2AE9F8DE4DC8"/>
now hath GOD ſet the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleaſed him.— And the eye cannot ſay to the hand, I have no need of thee; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you." The application of this compariſon, the <hi>apoſtle</hi> himſelf gives us, in the 7th V. and onwards. "Now ye are the body of CHRIST, &amp; mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in particular. And GOD hath ſet ſome in his church, firſt apoſtles, ſecondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, goverments, diverſities of tongues:" In which words is contained an enumeration of the various gifts, that then appeared in the church. The ſum of the <hi>apoſtle</hi>'s arguing is this, That 'tis with the church, CHRIST's <hi>myſtical</hi> body, as with the body <hi>natural.</hi> Its neceſſities are various, and require a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of gifts, ſome of one kind, others of another; ſome of ſuperior excellence, others inferior, according to the uſe they are intended to ſerve; every one of which is needful in its proper place, nor could the exigencies of the church be ſupplied without them. It would not have done ſo well, if all gifts had been alike. Had the <hi>whole body been an eye, where</hi> then <hi>were the hearing?</hi> There is really need, conſidering the different make of men, that there ſhould be different miniſterial gifts: And tho' in this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety ſome gifts will be <hi>ſmaller,</hi> and others <hi>greater,</hi> yet are the <hi>ſmaller</hi> equally neceſſary in their place; nor would the real advantage of the church be ſo well anſwered in any other way. <hi>Thoſe members of the body, which ſeem to be more feeble, are yet neceſſary</hi>; and the ſame may be ſaid of gifts. Thoſe that are <hi>weak</hi> may yet, in their place, be as uſeful as thoſe that are <hi>ſtrong.</hi> For in the church of CHRIST, there are <hi>babes</hi> as well as <hi>grown men</hi>; and the former need <hi>milk,</hi> while <hi>ſtrong meat</hi> is more proper for the latter; as, <hi>by reaſon of uſe, they have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern both good and evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inſtead then of finding fault, we have reaſon to admire that wiſdom of GOD, which has ſo varied the gifts of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as to ſuit the various diſpoſitions of people. By this method of diſtribution, there are gifts adapted, not only to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004913_0016_100E2AED3367BE88"/>
pleaſe all, but to work upon all, in that way, which is moſt conſonant to their peculiar frame and make.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I add, in the laſt place, as another reaſon of this <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> diſtribution of gifts, that hereby opportunity is given for the <hi>tryal,</hi> both of <hi>miniſters</hi> and <hi>people</hi>; of <hi>miniſters</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>each other,</hi> and of <hi>people</hi> towards <hi>miniſters.</hi> Had the gifts of miniſters been the <hi>ſame,</hi> there had been no room for thoſe of <hi>ſuperior</hi> gifts, to have given evidence of their humility and modeſty; <hi>eſteeming others better than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> and taking all opportunities to ſpeak of them and treat them with all due love and reſpect: Nor, on the other hand, for thoſe of <hi>inferior</hi> gifts, to have ſhown, that they were not envious at the greater accompliſhments of others, but could rejoice in them, and heartily bleſs GOD for them; wiſhing that they might be <hi>greatly</hi> uſeful, in proportion to the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of their gifts.—Neither, if the gifts of miniſters had been alike, would there have been opportunity, for <hi>people</hi> to have ſhewed forth an <hi>impartial diſpoſition</hi>; thinking neither <hi>too highly</hi> of ſome, nor <hi>too deſpicably</hi> of others; but entertaining ſuch a juſt tho't of all, as to be ready to gain advantage from all, without falling into contention and ſtrife, preferring ſome to the neglecting and contemning others. — But I may not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large here. Enough has been ſaid to juſtify both the <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> of GOD, in thus <hi>variouſly</hi> beſtowing his gifts on miniſters.</p>
            <p>The APPLICATION now remains. And it ſhall be in ſeveral uſes, relative both to <hi>miniſters</hi> and <hi>people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To begin with thoſe that relate to <hi>miniſters.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They may learn a proper <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>conduct,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their gifts be, whether <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>ſmaller.</hi> Is it the priviledge of any to be favoured with a <hi>diſtinguiſht furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> for the work of the miniſtry? They ſhould look upon it as a free gift of GOD, and take heed, they be not elated with pride. There may be danger of this. The holy apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had a <hi>thorn given him in the fleſh,</hi> leſt he ſhould be <hi>exalted above meaſure, thro' the abundance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations.</hi> And pride was too commonly the fault, even
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004913_0017_100E2AF1F5144990"/>
of thoſe, who, in the firſt days of chriſtianity, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with <hi>miraculous</hi> gifts and powers. They were too apt to be puffed up; entertaining ſo high a tho't of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as to deſpiſe others. Hence that ſolemn exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the apoſtle, <note n="‖" place="bottom">Rom. 12.3.</note> 
               <hi>I ſay, thro' the grace given to me, to every man among you, not to think more highly of himſelf than he ought; but to think ſoberly.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Don't en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage too high an opinion of your gifts; don't be ſelf-conceited and vain, putting an undue eſtimate upon your own excellencies as greater than others; but <hi>think ſoberly</hi> of your ſelves. i. e. maintain a modeſt, humble ſenſe of the gifts you have received of GOD: Tho' ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by <hi>this ſobriety,</hi> as Mr. HENRY obſerves, <hi>that ſobriety</hi> which would keep them in their own place and ſtation, from intruding into the gifts and offices of others; of which modeſt care, in the exerciſe of ſpiritual gifts, he gives us a noble example in the great apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who did not <hi>ſtretch himſelf beyond his meaſure, nor boaſt, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man's line, of things made ready to his hand</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. 10.13 to the 17.</note>. And very obſervable is the argument, with which the <hi>apoſtle</hi> enforces this neceſſary caution againſt pride in gifts. 'Tis couch'd in thoſe words, of this ſame verſe, ACCORDING AS GOD HAS DEALT <hi>to every man the meaſure of faith.</hi> And in the 6th V. where he ſpeaks of <hi>gifts differing</hi> AC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CORDING TO THE GRACE <hi>that is given to us.</hi> The tho't is the ſame with that in the text. <hi>There are diverſities of gifts, but the ſame ſpirit.</hi> And what conſideration can have a ſtronger influence to ſuppreſs all undue elation of mind, on account of any advantages by ſuperiority in gifts? <hi>What haſt thou,</hi> O man of GOD, <hi>that thou didſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive? Now, if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory, as if thou didſt not receive it?</hi> Art thou the beſt, and moſt accompliſht miniſter in the world? Thou art no more, thou art no better, than the free favour of GOD has made you. And the ſame good pleaſure of GOD that has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd you, might have diſtinguiſht others: nor can you aſſign any reaſon of the difference between you and

them, but that, <hi>even ſo, Father, becauſe ſo it hath ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi> What ground is there then of glorying? How unſeemly is this? How unlike to the <hi>high prieſt of our profeſſion,</hi> who was <hi>lowly in ſpirit,</hi> tho' poſſeſt of gifts beyond meaſure?</p>
            <p>And what tho' your gifts are ſuperior to the gifts of others? <hi>Their's</hi> may be neceſſary; yea, in their place, and for the end deſign'd in the beſtowment of them, <hi>their's</hi> may be as uſeful as <hi>your's.</hi> The al-wiſe GOD ſaw the ſtate of his church to be ſuch, as to need gifts of various kinds, ſmaller as well as greater; and they are all, in their place, equally conducive to the good of the body of CHRIST. Why then ſhould they, who have greater gifts, deſpiſe thoſe who have ſmaller? Why ſhould they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value them? Why take advantage from their ſuperior repute &amp; influence to leſſen their uſefulneſs in the church? What is this but to make a <hi>ſchiſm in the body of</hi> CHRIST? What is it but for the <hi>hand</hi> to diſpiſe the <hi>foot,</hi> and ſay, <hi>I have no need of thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the other hand, Is it the lot of any to be endow'd with <hi>fewer</hi> and <hi>ſmaller</hi> gifts? We have no ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, but the greateſt reaſon to be content. We have what an al-wiſe GOD tho't proper to give us. 'Twas he that divided to us this portion of gifts, and ſhall we find fault with his diſtribution? "Shall not the SPIRIT of GOD do what he will with his own? May he not give to what perſons he pleaſes, and in what proportion he pleaſes? One gift to one man, and another to another; to one more, and another fewer, as he thinks fit? Is he not the beſt judge, how his own purpoſes ſhall be ſerved, and his own donatives beſtow'd?" Let us be thankful we are what we are. If we ſuſtain the place of a <hi>foot</hi> only in the <hi>body of</hi> CHRIST, let us not murmur, becauſe we are not the <hi>head.</hi> The ſovereign GOD may certainly have liberty, to make us one or 'tother as pleaſes him. And we ſhould be particularly careful, that we don't envy others their ſuperior gifts, nor do any thing to leſſen the good influence of them, duly exerciſed. As 'tis for the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004913_0019_100E2AF9051C7CA8"/>
good of the <hi>body of</hi> CHRIST, there ſhould be gifts of <hi>greater</hi> excellency, we ſhould be thankful any are endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, and not repine that we are not the perſons.</p>
            <p>My <hi>fathers</hi> and <hi>brethren,</hi> It is by this mutual chriſtian good temper and conduct of miniſters, that they are to help forward the uſefulneſs of each other's gifts, for the common good: And 'tis really a matter, on which the intereſt of religion greatly depends, that they thus endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make one another as ſerviceable as they can. Let me uſe here the words of the late excellent Mr. WILLIAMS in his <hi>convention</hi> ſermon, <note n="‖" place="bottom">See P. 14.</note> 
               <q>Thoſe, ſays he, that are ſtrong ſhou'd not deſpiſe thoſe that are weaker, nor theſe envy, or by any means obſcure or leſſen the gifts of thoſe, who outſhine them; but ſhou'd rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in them, and bleſs GOD for them. This is one way, wherein humility, the chiefeſt of chriſtian graces, ſhould appear in us. How unworthy of miniſters is it to ſupplant, and depreciate one another? A thing that is very grateful to Satan and his inſtruments, but diſhonourable to CHRIST, and tends much to leſſen their uſefulneſs in the church.</q> To the like purpoſe are thoſe words of holy Mr. FLAVEL; where ſpeaking of miniſterial prudence, in its exerciſe toward <hi>brethren</hi> and <hi>fellow-workers</hi> in the LORD; he ſays, this prudence <q>will dictate and enjoyn it on us, that by the firmeſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them, we make their gifts and graces as uſeful as poſſible for the furtherance and advancement of our great and difficult work. We cannot be ignorant, how much ſatan hath gained, and CHRIST's intereſt hath ſenſibly loſt by thoſe unhappy diviſions and alienations among brethren, and fellow-labourers, in the work of the LORD. CHRIST hath ſhed down a variety of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion gifts upon them, which are not capable of a full improvement, but in union and conjunction with each other. Gifts are improv'd in us by prayer &amp; ſtudy, but the benefits of theſe gifts are ſhewed among us by love and unity. Love and union bring EVERY MAN'S GIFTS AND GRACES INTO THE COMMON BANK, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004913_0020_100E2AFD89277D98"/>
of MONOPOLIES, they drive a free and open trade to the great enriching of the Church.</q> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">See his works, vol. 2. P. 745, 746.</note> He adds a little further onwards, <q>When GOD has caſt the lot of two or more fellow-labourers in the Goſpel, upon the ſame city, town, or neighbourhood, what a bleſſed advantage have they, beyond ſolitary miniſters, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the work of the LORD chearfully, vigorouſly, and ſucceſsfully? Whilſt love cauſes their hearts to claſp and cloſe, how muſt their work be facilitated, ſweetned and proſpered in their hands? But if once jars and jealouſies get in among them; if pride, envy or carnal intereſt diſſolve the bond of brotherly love; if inſtead of planting for CHRIST, they once begin to ſupplant one another; no words are able to ſhew, what a train of miſchief and ſins will now break in among them, to the great diſhonour of CHRIST, and obſtruction of the goſpel. I do therefore, ſays he, in the name of CHRIST, as upon my bended knees, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly intreat and beſeech my brethren, by all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they have to the honour of CHRIST, the ſouls of their people, their own comfort, or the ſucceſs of their labours, that no envyings nor ſtrifes, no ſupplantings or detractions, be once admitted or named among them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I may not improperly add to what has been ſaid, that miniſters ſhould be in a diſpoſition, no more to leſſen one another's <hi>graces</hi> than gifts. If the degrees of grace in ſome are greater than in others; If they have a more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love to CHRIST, and zeal in his ſervice; or would expreſs theſe things in a way different from what others chuſe to do, they ſhould not herefrom entertain evil ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of their bretheren, as tho' they had no grace, no real love for CHRIST, or the ſouls of men; to be ſure, they ſhould not ſay or do that which may have a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to leaven the minds of people with fears and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies of this kind. It might alienate the hearts of people from miniſters, and put it out of their power of being ſo uſeful, as otherwiſe they might be; and what is worſe,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004913_0021_100E2B00A5D5AF28"/>
it might end in all thoſe dreadful evils, which are the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine fruits of faction and contention. Tis true, where miniſters have forfeited their character as men of religion, by a conduct diſagreable to the goſpel, it will be a ſervice, and not a hurt, to the cauſe of CHRIST, to repreſent them as they are; but the caſe is different, where the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of miniſters and their <hi>lives,</hi> agree with one another. They have a right, in this caſe, at leaſt, not to be ſpoken ill of; and 'tis plainly a breach upon the <hi>great law of chriſtian love</hi> to cenſure and judge ſuch, or indeed ſo much as to think evil of them.</p>
            <p>And the ſame may be ſaid as to <hi>ſmaller</hi> differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in the <hi>ſentiments</hi> of miniſters; they ſhould not, on this account, be out of all charity, deſpiſing and condemning one another; there ſhould not be heard among them names <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>To this purpoſe, is the following paſſage in a letter of the miniſters of</hi> New-England, <hi>to Mr.</hi> John Dury <hi>about his pacification, publiſh'd from the original copy, in the year</hi> 1664. <q>
                     <hi>Epiphanius</hi> would not that chriſtians ſhould have any <hi>By-name.</hi> Let the <hi>nick-name</hi> of <hi>Zuinglians</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> then ceaſe, the marks rather of <hi>faction,</hi> than of <hi>brotherly-union.</hi> What ſhould we have to do with <hi>Luther?</hi> What ſhould we have to do with <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin?</hi> We profeſs the <hi>goſpel,</hi> we believe the <hi>goſpel.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>This letter, as is declared in the</hi> preface <hi>to it, was returned with the ſubſcription of the names of allmoſt</hi> all <hi>the</hi> elders univerſally <hi>in</hi> New-England.</note> of reproach, which tend only to provoke and exaſperate. I ſpeak not againſt a due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the great truths of GOD and religion. Miniſters are <hi>ſet for the defence of the goſpel</hi>; and 'tis their duty to <hi>contend earneſtly for the faith once delivered to the ſaints</hi>; But wherein miniſters may differ, and yet be good men, why ſhould not they think well of one another? That rule of the apoſtle ought, in this caſe, always to take place, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. 3.14.</note> 
               <hi>Let not him that eateth, deſpiſe him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not, judge him that eateth.</hi> It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expected, in this world of imperfection and frailty,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004913_0022_100E2B062468A9D8"/>
but that good men ſhould ſee many things in a different light. They always have done ſo, and always will do ſo. And indeed theſe inſtances wherein miniſters may differ, and yet be good men, are the very ones wherein they ſhould expreſs their chriſtian charity and forbearance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards each other: Yea, in reſpect of theſe things, there ſhould be love and charity among chriſtians univerſally. Very excellent, to this purpoſe, are the words of one of the <hi>firſt</hi> fathers of this country, I mean the pious Mr. HIGGIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON, ſays he, <q>Let none ſay, that theſe or thoſe are diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the cauſe of GOD and his people, becauſe they ſee not in ſome things as others do. Do not impropriate the cauſe of religion to ſome, in oppoſition to others, who profeſs the ſame cauſe. None ſhould ſpeak of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as if they were the godly party, and eminently ſaints, &amp; ſkilful, with deſpiſing others. Nothing is more offenſive among chriſtians, than to confine religion to ſome ſingular opinion, as if religion did mainly center there. There were differences in <hi>Corinth.</hi> How does the apoſtle write to them all? <hi>To the ſaints at Corinth, and to all that call on the name of the</hi> LORD JESUS, <hi>their</hi> LORD <hi>and ours.</hi> Mark that expreſſion, <hi>their</hi> LORD <hi>and ours. Their's</hi> and <hi>our's,</hi> wherein the apoſtle checks the conceitedneſs in ſome, that would impale and encloſe the common cauſe of CHRIST to themſelves, and ſome peculiar opinion of their's: Let us beware of this. And the <hi>apoſtle</hi> ſaw it needful to admoniſh the beſt chriſtians, <hi>Let nothing be done thro' ſtrife or vain-glory,</hi> or in a way of provoking one another; avoiding jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and uncharitable cenſures, being watchful that ſatan get no advantage. This alſo is for our admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition—.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Miniſters ſhould conſider, what their <hi>own proper gifts</hi> are, and be <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>diligent</hi> in the uſe of them. Every miniſter has his own gifts; and they are peculiar to him:<note n="†" place="bottom">See his <hi>election</hi> ſermon, preacht in the year 1663, pag. 21, 22.</note>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:004913_0023_100E2B0A8FFA2620"/>
He may be known and diſtinguiſh'd by them. And as in the diſtribution of theſe gifts, the bleſſed God knew which were beſt for this miniſter, and which for that, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly endow'd every one with his <hi>proper gifts</hi>; ſo they ſhould endeavour to know their own gifts, and not <hi>affect</hi> the uſe of the gifts of others. This is, virtually, to find fault with the divine diſtributions; 'tis a conſtructive declaration, that other gifts would have been better for us, than thoſe the alwiſe God has been pleaſed to furniſh us with: Nor will it, eventually, turn out to our own honour, any more than the advantage of the public. Tis obvious to a diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eye, when the uſe of a gift is <hi>natural,</hi> and when <hi>affected:</hi> Nor can a man, ordinarily, exerciſe himſelf in any gift, ſo well as that, which falls in with his natural turn and genius. Some miniſters (tho' but few) are form'd for ſudden ſpeakers; they have a quick tho't, and ready utterance: Others have no natural fluency either of thot's or words; and 'tis pity, ſuch ſhould ſo miſtake their gifts, as to <hi>affect</hi> to be, and to do, like thoſe, they are, in their original make, ſo different from. Inſtead of envying the gifts of others by a vain ſhew, that we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd with them, we ſhou'd rather conſider, we have our <hi>own</hi> gifts, as others have <hi>their's</hi>; and that <hi>our's</hi> are as proper for us, as <hi>their's</hi> are for them. How prepoſterous would it be, ſhou'd the <hi>foot</hi> attempt to act the part of the <hi>hand,</hi> or the <hi>ear</hi> the part of the <hi>eye?</hi> 'Twould tend to the confuſion of the <hi>body natural</hi>; and it would bring the like confuſion into the body <hi>myſtical,</hi> if miniſters, leaving the uſe of their own proper gifts, ſhou'd affect the uſe of the gifts of <hi>others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is of greater importance, miniſters ſhou'd be <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>diligent</hi> in the uſe of their gifts. The apoſtle exhorts<note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Tim. 4.14.</note>, <hi>neglect not the gift that is in thee.</hi> And he aſſures us, in my context, that the <hi>miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> i. e. in his various gifts, <hi>is given to every man to profit with all.</hi> i.e. that they may do all the good they can with their abilities. And indeed, what other valuable reaſon can be
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004913_0024_100E2B0D3A6981A8"/>
aſſign'd for the beſtowment of miniſterial gifts? Surely, they were not given meerly for the honor &amp; advantage of thoſe that have them; no, but that the <hi>body</hi> of CHRIST might be <hi>increaſed and edified.</hi> The <hi>body natural</hi> was not form'd with ſo great a variety of members for mere ſhew, but for real uſe; and wherein any member fails in this point, it becomes a burden. The ſame may be ſaid of the <hi>body</hi> of CHRIST, the church. He has furniſht it with paſtors and teachers, and theſe with gifts of various kinds, and in various degrees: And why, not that they might be uſeleſs, but be bro't forth into exerciſe: Nor, unleſs miniſters are active and faithful, in the uſe of their gifts, will they, in any tolerable meaſure, anſwer the end of their being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd with them. 'Tis true, the way and manner in which miniſters may think proper to expreſs their fidelity, in the exerciſe of their gifts, may be different; ſo that one miniſter ought not to be judged unfaithful, becauſe he does not, in all things, act as does another: Neither are the ſame improvements to be expected of thoſe, who have few gifts, as of thoſe who have many: But yet all ought to be faithful. Yea, thoſe, who have the ſmalleſt and feweſt gifts, can give no reaſon, why they ſhould not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully employ them. The induſtrious improvement of our gifts, be they great or ſmall, few or many, is abſolutely required of us; nor unleſs we are faithful, ſhall we do our duty to that body, of which we are members, or to CHRIST the common head of this body: Nor will any thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his finally cutting us off, as members that are uſeleſs and unprofitable.</p>
            <p>I ſay not theſe things to encourage any jealouſies in the minds of people againſt miniſters, as though they were unfaithful; ſo far from it, that I would take this occaſion to expreſs it as my real tho't, that the people, in this land, are bleſt with as faithful and diligent a ſet of Paſtors, as are to be found in any part of the chriſtian world. I don't mean, that there are no miniſters, that may not be complained of for their negligence; but that, in the general, and as a body of men, there is reaſon for thankfulneſs, they are ſo active and laborious in the duties
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004913_0025_100E2B114E58F558"/>
of their calling; and to repreſent them as otherwiſe would be an unjuſt reflection on them, as well as a denial of that grace of GOD which appears in them. But to proceed,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Miniſters ſhould be cautious, leſt, under the pretence of <hi>depending on the</hi> SPIRIT, they ſhould <hi>neglect that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> in the <hi>uſe of ſtudy,</hi> which is <hi>really neceſſary.</hi> The bleſſed SPIRIT, 'tis true, is the great diſpenſer of all gifts, as well as grace. 'Tis he that furniſhes men for the work of the miniſtry, and aſſiſts them in it; and ought accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to be truſted in and depended on: But then, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with this dependance, there ought to be the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of miniſters themſelves, in the uſe of means. Their caſe is different <hi>now,</hi> from what it was in the days of the <hi>apoſtles. That</hi> was the <hi>age of inſpiration.</hi> Miniſters were <hi>then</hi> aſſiſted <hi>immediately</hi> from above, without any previous tho't or care of their own. They might then venture to ſpeak without premeditation, depending on the SPIRIT, to give them, in a <hi>miraculous</hi> way, what they ſhould ſay. But the SPIRIT does not <hi>now</hi> aſſiſt miniſters, as he did in thoſe times of <hi>extraordinary revelations.</hi> He does it in a way more <hi>humane,</hi> in the uſe of previous preparation by meditation and ſtudy. And while miniſters, in this way, depend on the SPIRIT for his aſſiſtance and bleſſing, they may humbly hope he will be preſent with them to all the purpoſes, wherein they need his help: Whereas, they have no warrant to expect, he will make up for their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, by any miraculous deſcent upon them, as it were, <hi>in tongues of fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I would recommend to the conſideration, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of thoſe, who are <hi>candidates</hi> for the <hi>miniſtry.</hi> There is ſuch a thing, my young friends, as <hi>preſuming</hi> upon the Divine SPIRIT, as well as neglecting to place a due dependance on him; and there may be danger in one as well as 'tother of theſe extreams. Avoid them both. Let your dependance continually be upon the Divine SPIRIT for all <hi>miniſterial gifts</hi>; but, at the ſame time, ſo place your dependence, as not to think your own endeavours needleſs. You may not expect to be accompliſht with
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004913_0026_100E2B15C3443650"/>
gifts, but in the uſe of labour and pains. You muſt therefore mind your ſtudies, be diligent in an attendance to reading and meditation, as well as prayer. And when you are, in this way, under the influence of the bleſſed SPIRIT, furniſht with ſutable gifts, let me adviſe you not to think of venturing into the <hi>pulpit,</hi> without a ſutable care to prepare your <hi>ſermons before hand.</hi> You ought not to expect <hi>immediate inſpiration</hi>; nor may you depend upon the aſſiſtance of heaven, but in the way of previous diligent ſtudy. You may, in this way ſpeak without your notes; but if this ſhould be your choice, let it ever be from your <hi>memories,</hi> and not in the <hi>extemporaneous</hi> way. You can't well take too much pains about your ſermons; eſpecially, at firſt, and 'till you have got form'd in you a readineſs to deliver your ſelves in a clear and methodical manner: And even after this, you muſt, ordinarily, ſtudy before you preach, if you would ſpeak as becomes the <hi>oracles</hi> of GOD. Hearken to the ſentiments of that <hi>apoſtolical</hi> man, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouned ELIOT, upon this matter<note n="†" place="bottom">Theſe words were tranſcrib'd from a <hi>manuſcript</hi> ſermon of Mr. ELIOT's; but they expreſs his known ſentiments, as may appear from the following paragraph in Dr. COT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON MATHER's <hi>life of this excellent man.</hi> Says he of him, pag. 54, "He liked no <hi>preaching,</hi> but what had been <hi>well ſtudied for</hi>; and he would very much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a ſermon, which he could perceive had required ſome good <hi>thinking</hi> and <hi>reading</hi> in the author of it. I have been preſent, when he has, unto a preacher then juſt come home from the aſſembly with him, thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf; <hi>Brother, there was oyl required for the ſanctuary; but it muſt be beaten oyl; I praiſe</hi> GOD, <hi>that I ſaw your oyl ſo well beaten to day. The</hi> LORD <hi>help us always by good ſtudy to beat our oyl, that there may be no knots in our ſermons left undiſſolv'd, and that there may a clear light be thereby given in the houſe of</hi> GOD!

Anſwer, No. For tho' in an <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary caſe,</hi> before enemies, or in preaching, if GOD calls to work with little preparation, truſt him the more; yet, <hi>ordinarily</hi> GOD's SPIRIT helps when we ſtudy &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, tho' it will not be wanting in the delivering. And the contrary, as it ariſes out of a ſpirit of ſloth, ſo it foſters and maintains it, and pride. (2.) It expoſes a man to ſpeak rawly and indigeſted matter to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and involves often in ambiguities, or impertinencies, or miſtakes, &amp;c. (3) The office of the miniſtry is a labour, wherein we muſt give all diligence, &amp; ſtudy and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Study what we can, pray and believe for the reſt.</q> Hear alſo the advice of the venerable Dr. INCREASE MATHER. Says he, in his <hi>ſermon</hi> preacht at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in the hearing of the <hi>ſtudents</hi> there, Miniſters <note n="‡" place="bottom">See his book entitled, <hi>Practical truths plainly delivered,</hi> p. 112, 113.</note>

Says <hi>Solomon, The preacher ſought to find out acceptable words,</hi> Eccl. 12.10.

All gracious aſſiſtance comes in, only in the actings of diligence. To neglect our ſtudies, and yet to hope that CHRIST will help us, will be found in us the moſt aggravated preſumption.

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004913_0029_100E2B20C7DBDB28"/>
this way of painful ſtudy, we may hope to be more and more enriched with all gifts and graces. This is the courſe, which the apoſtle directs <hi>Timothy</hi> to, in order to his proficiency in ſpiritual gifts and abilities. 1 Tim. 4.13, 15. <hi>Give attendance to reading, meditate upon theſe things, give thy ſelf wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear to all.</hi> In this caſe, that will be found a truth, Prov. 10.4. <hi>The hand of the diligent maketh rich.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But 'tis more than time that I proceed to thoſe uſes, which relate to <hi>people.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. You ſhould be <hi>thankful to</hi> GOD, who, for your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, has diſtributed ſo great a variety of gifts to miniſters. There is ſcarce a gift, in any kind, or meaſure, but it may be found in ſome miniſter or other; and in ſome, there is a glorious collection of many of the moſt valuable gifts. It was not, my <hi>brethren,</hi> for <hi>their</hi> ſakes, but <hi>your's</hi>; it was not for their own ſingle advantage, but for your edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that GOD has thus ſhed down his gifts on his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. O be thankful to him for theſe effects of his free love and favour! And while you give glory to the FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, neglect not to adore the SON; for when on earth, he purchaſed theſe gifts for the perfecting the ſaints, and the edifying his body; and this, <hi>not with corruptible things, ſuch as ſilver and gold, but with his own precious blood</hi>: And now he is aſcended on high, he diſpenſes theſe gifts, in free favour, as acts of his royal grace and bounty. Only, as the DIVINE SPIRIT is the perſon, with whom theſe gifts are intruſted by the FATHER and the SON, to be <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſeverally</hi> among the preachers of ſalvation, as he pleaſes, let HIM alſo have his ſhare of your religious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You ſhould be careful to <hi>improve</hi> the various gifts of miniſters to your <hi>own advantage,</hi> and not turn them into an occaſion of ſtrife. The deſign of GOD, in <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi> diſtributing his gifts to miniſters, was that he might ſuit <hi>your diſpoſitions,</hi> and by this means render them the <hi>more ſerviceable</hi> to you. Your own ſpiritual benefit therefore, is what you ſhould aim at, from the exerciſe of theſe gifts. You ſhou'd put a due value upon them all, and do your utmoſt to get as much good by them all as is
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004913_0030_100E2B2483D7EAD0"/>
poſſible. O how happy would it be, if this chriſtian good temper reigned univerſally in people! O how much more profitable would the preaching of miniſters be, than now it is! Their gifts, however various would then have their proper influence, without obſtruction, in doing ſervice to the body of CHRIST; and by this union in people, to gain ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by every gift for edification, 'tis inconceivable what would be the good ariſing here from. —</p>
            <p>But this <hi>variety</hi> in the gifts of miniſters, as it is capable of much good, ſo it is likewiſe of much evil. It may be turn'd into an occaſion of emulation and ſtrife, faction and ſciſm. And alas! that this has ſo often been the caſe! It was ſo, even in the days of the <hi>apoſtles,</hi> and in reſpect of thoſe miniſters too, who were miraculouſly endow'd by the HOLY GHOST. An unhappy inſtance of this, we have in the church at <hi>Corinth.</hi> The <hi>apoſtle,</hi> in his <hi>firſt epiſtle</hi> to them, 3 chap. 3 v. complains, that there was <hi>among them envying, and ſtrife, and diviſion.</hi> And in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſe, he particularly acquaints them, with the ground of this complaint. <hi>One ſaith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apolles.</hi> They had got, it ſhould ſeem, into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, on account of the preachers among them; ſome cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themſelves after the name of this preacher, &amp; others after the name of that: And each party ſo admired the preacher they denominated themſelves from, as to hold the other (comparatively at leaſt) in contempt; the effect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was, thoſe emulations and contentions, which broke the peace of the church. The holy <hi>apoſtle</hi> was exceedingly grieved to ſee ſuch a ſpirit of ſtrife and debate prevailing among them; and very ſeverely rebukes them for it. He compares them to <hi>babes,</hi> v. 1. i. e. Perſons that had grown to no conſiderable maturity in the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> life; yea, he pronounces them <hi>carnal. Whereas,</hi> ſays he, v. 3. <hi>there is among you envying, and ſtrife, and diviſions, are ye not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and walk as men?</hi> And again, in the following verſe, <hi>while one ſaith I am of Paul; and another, I am of Appollos, are ye not carnal?</hi> As if he had ſaid, "Your thus getting into parties, is a plain evidence of the remains of a carnal ſpirit in you, that you are too much under the influence of corrupt paſſions and afflictions. From whence come <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004913_0031_100E2B278D2EC180"/>
emulations, wrath ſtrife?</hi> Come they not of <hi>men's luſts?</hi> They are certainly <hi>works of the fleſh</hi>: And as theſe appear among you, it's a ſure argument, if not of the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>carnality</hi> in you, yet at leaſt of its prevalence, that 'tis not ſo much ſubdued in you as it ought to be."</p>
            <p>And this is always the caſe, when people take occaſion from the <hi>different</hi> gifts of miniſters, to contend with heat, and animoſity; crying up ſome, ſo as to reflect undue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace on others. Not that people are to think alike of all miniſters: By no means, ſome miniſters are bleſt with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior gifts, and people may undoubtedly prefer thoſe that are beſt gifted. There is no harm in this, nothing can be objected againſt it; 'tis indeed impoſſible, they ſhould do otherwiſe: Eſpecially, ought they to prize and value thoſe miniſters, who have been inſtrumental of ſpiritual good to them. They ſhould eſteem ſuch highly in love, for the uſe GOD has made of them to their edification in faith and holineſs. But they ſhould not prefer one miniſter, be his gifts or graces ever ſo great, to the diſparagement of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 'Tis utterly a fault to deſpiſe this miniſter, becauſe he han't thoſe endowments, another is favoured with. Shall <hi>Paul</hi> be ſlighted, becauſe he han't the <hi>eloquence</hi> of <hi>Apollos?</hi> Or, <hi>Apollos</hi> be meanly tho't of, becauſe he han't the <hi>reaſon</hi> of <hi>Paul?</hi> Shall <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> be undervalued becauſe they can't ſpeak in the mild, ſoft, tender manner of <hi>Joſes?</hi> Or, <hi>he</hi> be treated with neglect, becauſe he can't utter himſelf in <hi>their</hi> words of thunder? This would be to bring confuſion into the church of GOD. It would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily occaſion that variance and ſtrife, which would eat out the bowels of true chriſtianity. It is, my <hi>brethren,</hi> according to the <hi>pleaſure</hi> of the <hi>Divine</hi> SPIRIT, that gifts are variouſly divided to miniſters; and 'tis really for <hi>your good</hi> that it is ſo. Hereby you may all be pleas'd &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified. And if ſome of you are more pleas'd with one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, others with another, and others with another ſtill, why ſhou'd you pervert the good intention of a good GOD in the beſtowment of theſe gifts, by mutual emulation and ſtrife? Inſtead of needleſs debates, whether this, or the other miniſter, is beſt qualified with gifts, you ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the wiſdom of GOD, in ſo wonderfully adjuſting his
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004913_0032_100E2B2C19CE8D58"/>
gifts to your various diſpoſitions: Inſtead of preferring thoſe of <hi>greater</hi> gifts, ſo as to throw contempt on thoſe of <hi>ſmaller,</hi> you ſhould endeavour to get all the good you can from them all. And let me ſay, there is no faithful miniſter of CHRIST, be his gifts what they will, but you may reap advantage from them, if it be not your own fault: Eſpecially, may you do ſo, if you look upon miniſters as they really are, nothing more than <hi>inſtruments</hi> in the great affair of men's ſalvation. The not attending to this may be one reaſon of the undue preference of miniſters. The <hi>apoſtle</hi> in the caſe of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in order to give check to this <hi>party ſpirit,</hi> which appeared among them, applies to them in that language<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. 3.5, 6, 7.</note>; <hi>Who then is Paul, and who is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos, but Miniſters by whom ye believed, even as the</hi> LORD GAVE TO EVERY MAN? <hi>I have planted Apollos watered; but</hi> GOD GAVE THE INCREASE: <hi>So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but</hi> GOD THAT GIVETH THE INCREASE. The beſt preacher in the world, the moſt moving and awakening, the moſt rational and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, can produce no ſaving change in the heart of any, but as a <hi>Divine power</hi> goes along with his endeavours. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Paul,</hi> nor <hi>Apollos,</hi> nor <hi>Cephas,</hi> are any thing without God; and with the concurrence of his grace, miniſters of inferior gifts may ſpeak effectually to the ſalvation of their hearers. This ſhould govern your eſtimate of miniſters; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining you from too high thoughts of the <hi>beſt,</hi> and too low ones of thoſe that are <hi>inferior</hi> to them. The <hi>former</hi> can't be the <hi>authors</hi> and the <hi>latter</hi> may be the <hi>inſtruments</hi> of ſanctification to you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi> I ſpeak not theſe things with a deſign to offend any; but becauſe they are a <hi>word in ſeaſon</hi>: And whoever is not ſenſible of this, muſt be unacquainted with the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affairs in this place. There has certainly been too much beat and ſtrife about miniſters; ſome contending for one, others for another: And, I believe, no one will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to juſtify thoſe hard ſpeeches, which have ſometimes dropt from the lips of thoſe, who, I would hope, are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe good chriſtians. If you prefer ſome miniſters to others, yet don't ſlight thoſe, of whoſe gifts, you have not ſo high an opinion. If, in your apprehenſion, they be men of inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:004913_0033_100E2B2FDF89E9E0"/>
gifts, they may not be ſo in the tho't of others; they may have a great eſteem of their gifts; yea, and of their graces too: Don't do any thing to hinder their uſefulneſs to thoſe, who value them, tho' they ſhou'd not be ſo well fitted to be uſeful to you: Or, if their gifts are really ſmall, they are ſuch as GOD has given them, and they ought not therefore to be deſpiſed: Beſides, their gifts being ſmall, their work is ſo much the harder: Dont make it ſtill more burdenſome, by heaping upon them the occaſions of grief &amp; diſcouragement.</p>
            <p>And bear with me, while I go on to caution you againſt <hi>ſuch an itch</hi> after <hi>other preachers,</hi> as may lead you to forſake your <hi>own miniſters</hi> on the <hi>Lord's-day,</hi> to the breaking in upon the good order of the <hi>Town</hi>: And I the rather menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, becauſe it has been taken notice of by the <hi>body of your miniſters,</hi> who have more than once, come into an agreement among themſelves, not to aſk thoſe miniſters to preach on the <hi>ſabbath,</hi> who might be the occaſion of your coming into ſuch diſorders on this holy day. And this agreement has been generally approved of by the moſt pious and judicious among us, ſo far as I can learn.</p>
            <p>I cannot more agreably cloſe this head than in the words of the late pious and excellent Mr. WILLARD <note n="‖" place="bottom">See his <hi>lectures</hi> on the <hi>catechiſm,</hi> p. 641.</note>. Says he, ſpeaking of the perſon, who had adjoin'd himſelf to ſome ſociety of profeſſors, and put himſelf under the diſpenſation of the ordinances there, <q>He ought <hi>ordinarily</hi> to give his attendance upon the preaching of ſuch a miniſtry, as is there eſtabliſht. I ſay, <hi>ordinarily,</hi> for there may be ſuch occaſions offer'd him in the providence of GOD, which call him to be elſewhere, and he ought not to neglect the opportunity, in the place, where he may enjoy it: And for this reaſon there is a <hi>communion of churches</hi> neceſſary to be upheld: Nor is there reaſon to be cenſorious of ſuch, as may on ſpecial conſiderations, <hi>for once &amp; away,</hi> attend upon the preaching in another congregation; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, if in the ſame town: But for ſuch, on the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, to go to other towns for their <hi>curioſity</hi> or <hi>prejudice,</hi> when they are at a conſiderable diſtance, when they have the word preacht at their doors, and in their own congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations; this is not only a caſting contempt upon their
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004913_0034_100E2B329D5B6D38"/>
own miniſters, but a prophanation of the <hi>Lord's-day:</hi> And for ſuch to run <hi>this</hi> day, or <hi>part</hi> of the day, to <hi>one,</hi> and the next to <hi>another,</hi> meerly to pleaſe their <hi>fancy,</hi> or <hi>itching ears,</hi> is contrary to the mind of CHRIST. <hi>Paul,</hi> writing to a particular church, giveth that caution, Heb. 10.25. <hi>Not forſaking the aſſembling of your ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is.</hi> And if many ſhou'd drive this trade, as there are <hi>too many</hi> that do, it would offer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy diſcouragements to GOD's ſtewards, who have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken pains to provide their ſpiritual nouriſhment. Nor can a chriſtian, with a <hi>regular faith,</hi> ordinarily promiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that bleſſing and profit from <hi>another,</hi> that he might from <hi>him,</hi> whom GOD hath appointed to diſpenſe to him.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In the laſt place, <hi>People</hi> ſhould be careful, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage <hi>thoſe only,</hi> to undertake the <hi>work of preaching,</hi> who are <hi>ſutably endow'd with gifts.</hi> This is an obvious infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from what has been offered. For certainly, the SPIRIT would not have been appointed to diſtribute gifts to <hi>men</hi> for the <hi>work of the miniſtry,</hi> if <hi>they</hi> might be tho't qualified perſons for this work, without the beſtowment of theſe gifts. And, as the SPIRIT does not <hi>now</hi> furniſh perſons for preachers, in a <hi>miraculous</hi> manner, but in a way more accommodate to the nature of man, by <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>ſtudy</hi>; thoſe, who han't had the advantage of an <hi>education,</hi> and pretend not to any <hi>tolerable degrees of learning,</hi> cant, ordinarily, be tho't proper perſons, to be employ'd in this ſacred buſineſs; and to encourage ſuch to engage in it, may be of dangerous conſequence; eſpecially, at preſent, when <hi>ſo many</hi> are ready to think themſelves <hi>ſufficiently gifted</hi> for this great undertaking. The <hi>firſt fathers</hi> of this country, who were, perhaps, a ſet of as holy men as the world ever ſaw, ſince the days of inſpiration, had no notion of men's being <hi>ſufficiently qualified to be miniſters,</hi> without <hi>education</hi> and <hi>learning.</hi> Had they had ſuch a tho't, they would never have founded the <hi>college,</hi> in the very infancy of the country, when they were but poor and low, and had a thouſand diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to encounter. They ſeem indeed to have been afraid, leſt an <hi>unlearned miniſtry</hi> ſhou'd take place in the land; and have been particular in their care to guard againſt it.

Sure, there was little reaſon for ſuch an exclamation, if ability to read <hi>engliſh</hi> be ſufficient; but one would think that ſpeech implies that ſuch abilities and ſufficiencies are requiſite for this work, as are not very eaſy to be found.

               </q> To the like purpoſe is the following obſervable paſſage, taken from a <hi>ſermon</hi> of our memorable ELIOT, from that text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.19. Where, in anſwer to this queſtion, <q>What is it to become a fool, or ſo to deny our own wiſdom as to lean on the wiſdom of CHRIST?</q> One of the things ſaid is, that <q>it is not to let it lie by, and make no uſe of it in the miniſtry;—for this is <hi>Familiſtical</hi>; who abuſively inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the <hi>denial</hi> of learning, that they muſt have no <hi>books</hi> but the <hi>bible,</hi> and need no learning, nor muſt uſe any, but rely on the SPIRIT: And this curſed opinion helps on ſome in their opinion about <hi>private men's propehſying</hi> in ſuch a corrupt &amp; diſorderly way, as to ſlight and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the miniſtry. And ſome of late, in this land, have not ſpared to ſay, that if this generation of miniſters were but dead, they ſhould have more liberty of <hi>propheſying,</hi> as it ſeems; hoping that the next generation will have <hi>no learning.</hi> And they further plead, that there needs no learning in preaching the goſpel, and if one of them had but the text in hand, they could <hi>by the</hi> SPIRIT do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than the miniſter <hi>by his learning</hi>; as if the SPIRIT did not breathe in learning, and as if learning were not a <hi>ſpecial, ſanctified inſtrument</hi> for the SPIRIT to uſe in preaching. Yea, they have pleaded, what <hi>learning had the apoſtles</hi>?—Nay, ſome have been ſo blaſphemous as to ſay, <hi>what learning had</hi> CHRIST? Who is the GOD of all wiſdom, learning and knowledge.</q> I might cite words of the ſame import from many of your eminent <hi>fathers</hi> in the <hi>miniſtry,</hi> from the <hi>firſt</hi> ſettlement of NEW-ENGLAND, and down along to the preſent day.—But the time will not permit: Yet ſuffer me to tranſcribe a few lines from <hi>a faithful advice to the churches of</hi> NEW ENGLAND, by ſeveral <hi>miniſters</hi>; ſome of whom were as noted for their <hi>learning</hi> &amp; <hi>piety</hi> as any who have ever yet appear'd among us. <q>We are not unſenſible, ſay they, that one thing which has much expos'd ſome injudicious people among us, is an opinion that <hi>illiterate</hi> men may be ſerviceable and admirable <hi>preachers.</hi>—And tho' ſome <hi>unlearned</hi> men have been uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the intereſts of <hi>religion,</hi> yet no man ever decried

If GOD ſhould be provokt by the <hi>unthankfulneſs</hi> of men, to ſend the <hi>plague of an unlearned miniſtry</hi> upon poor NEW-ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND, ſoon will the <hi>wild beaſts of the deſart lie there, the houſes will be full of doleful creatures, and owls will dwell there.</hi> Ordinarily, that man who undertakes the <hi>miniſtry</hi> of the goſpel, without ſome education for it, is, we doubt in as preſumptuous an error as the unhappy <hi>Uzziah,</hi> that periſhed in his <hi>error</hi>; tho' we alſo allow different <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> and <hi>places</hi> for that education. And that man was never worthy to <hi>preach one ſermon,</hi> who did not feel, and would not own, that all the learning that can be had, is little enough to accompliſh <hi>an able miniſter of the new-teſtament.</hi>

            <p>I have not mention'd the names of theſe <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>eminent fathers,</hi> as tho' I aim'd at <hi>eſtabliſhing any truth</hi> by their <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>: No, that can be done only by <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>ſcripture</hi>; but that it might be ſeen, that thoſe who are for encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>unlearned miniſtry,</hi> do not only depart in this article, from the <hi>principles</hi> of the <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>firſt miniſters</hi> in NEW-ENGLAND, but are falling into the very <hi>error</hi> they were afraid of, and very zealouſly caution'd people againſt.</p>

               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:004913_0038_100E2B3F5BB5A890"/>Neither was it my deſign, in what I have ſpoken from theſe <hi>great</hi> men, to inſinuate as though <hi>nothing but learning</hi> was neceſſary to furniſh a <hi>goſpel-miniſter.</hi>—No man ought to be put into the <hi>miniſtry,</hi> who is not <hi>viſibly,</hi> and in the <hi>judgment of charity,</hi> a <hi>good chriſtian</hi>: Nor can a man that is not <hi>really</hi> ſo, ever <hi>ſave</hi> his <hi>own ſoul,</hi> tho' he may be the <hi>means</hi> of <hi>ſaving</hi> the ſouls of <hi>others.</hi> But however ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a qualification <hi>ſanctifying grace</hi> may be for <hi>miniſters,</hi> whether in reſpect of <hi>themſelves,</hi> or their <hi>people</hi> 'tis not <hi>all</hi> that is neceſſary. There muſt be <hi>gifts</hi> as well as <hi>grace</hi>; and theſe too, attain'd in the <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ordinary</hi> way, by <hi>education</hi> and <hi>ſtudy:</hi> Nor otherwiſe may it be thought, there are the <hi>needful</hi> accompliſhments for the <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>miniſtry.— Grace</hi> and <hi>learning</hi> are no ways inconſiſtent with each other. And where <hi>miniſters</hi> have <hi>grace,</hi> the <hi>greater</hi> their <hi>learning</hi> the <hi>more</hi> capable will they be, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>moſt eminently</hi> uſeful:— Nor without ſome <hi>good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> of <hi>learning,</hi> let the <hi>graces</hi> of any be what they will, are they fit for <hi>preachers</hi>;— and 'twill, in the end, prove a great diſ-ſervice to the intereſt of religion, if people en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage ſuch to take upon them the employment of <hi>miniſters.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Your patience (which I have too far tried already) will allow me to add nothing more, but my hearty prayer, that the deſign of GOD in beſtowing his <hi>various</hi> gifts on <hi>miniſters,</hi> may be effectually accompliſht in you, in your <hi>all coming in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the</hi> SON <hi>of</hi> GOD, <hi>unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of</hi> CHRIST. To <hi>him</hi> be <hi>glory</hi> in the <hi>church,</hi> on <hi>earth</hi> and in <hi>heaven,</hi> forever and ever, Amen.</p>
