            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>I PETER V.5.</bibl>
               <q>Yea, all of you be ſubject to one another.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WITHOUT enquiring into the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular meaning of theſe words, conſidered in a ſenſe reſtrained by their coherence with what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds and follows, I ſhall take them as an independent ſentence; in which detached view, they comprehend all thoſe duties of civil and ſocial life, which mankind owe to one another, whatever difference there may be among them, as to their reſpective capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities and outward condition in the world.</p>
            <p>As men are formed for ſociety, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be happy in a ſtate of ſeparation from
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017899_0005_0FA37C0601D9A9D0"/>
one another; ſo their well-being depends upon mutual aſſiſtance and ſupport, and a reciprocal interchange of thoſe offices of friendſhip and benevolence, which their mutual dependence requires, and both rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and religion preſcribe.</p>
            <p>That all men ought in ſome ſenſe to be <hi>ſubject to one another,</hi> is the plain doctrine of the apoſtle Peter, in the words juſt read. This doctrine concerns all ſocieties, under every form and conſtitution of government, whether monarchal, popular or mixed. It is eſpecially ſuited to the genius of a commonwealth, founded upon this leading principle, that "all men are born free and equal;" that is, come into the world on even ground in regard to authority; no one having a right to govern, in virtue of primogeniture, or deſcent from an higher and more noble parentage than others.</p>
            <p>The ſubject therefore is worthy of the attention of this reſpectable auditory; and the ſpeaker has no doubt but they will afford him their can did indulgence, while he modeſtly attempts to offer a few thoughts upon it, though he ſhould not be able to handle it, in a manner anſwerable to it's dignity and importance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:017899_0006_0FA37C06C1836F98"/>According to it's moſt common uſe, the word <hi>ſubjection</hi> ſignifies the ſubmiſſion of an inferior to a ſuperior, and applies only to thoſe duties, which men owe to thoſe, who have authority over them. In order therefore to accommodate the doctrine of mutual ſubjection, to all the members of a community, we muſt ſometimes depart from the ſtrict ſenſe of this word, or vary the meaning of it, ſo as to make it conſiſt with the differences between men, in regard to their ſeveral abilities; and with thoſe diſtinctions of office, rank and authority, which are neceſſary in ſociety.</p>
            <p>It is evident that the duties, which men owe to one another, and to ſociety, are not, in all caſes, preciſely the ſame; but muſt be different, according to the difference of their reſpective advantages, opportunities and other circumſtances. And when any one fulfils the obligations reſulting from his particular condition and ſtation in life; or that ariſe from the particular ſphere of action, whether high or low, in which he moves; he does, on his part, conform to the great law of mutual ſubjection, and render himſelf a good and uſeful member of ſociety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:017899_0007_0FA37C0780136CA8"/>Every one ought to conſider, that he was born, not for himſelf alone, but for others, for ſociety, for his country; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that he is indiſpenſibly obliged to render the beſt aſſiſtance and ſervice in his power, to his fellow-citizens around him, and to contribute his ſhare towards the general intereſt of the community to which he belongs. This obligation is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a few; but extends to all, from the higheſt officer in the ſtate, through all ſubordinate ranks, and interior orders and degrees, down to the loweſt peaſant and plebcan. For though all are not able to render themſelves uſeful and beneficial, in the ſame reſpects; yet there is no one, who enjoys the powers of reaſon and health, in any tolerable degree, but may, by a ſuitable employment of his faculties and abilities, not only ſerve himſelf, but the public, and make himſelf a bleſſing, in ſome reſpect or other.</p>
            <p>There is a reſemblance between the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body and the body politic. The natural body is compoſed of many members; none of which are uſeleſs; but all calculated to anſwer ſome valuable purpoſe, and ſubſerve the good of the whole. What therefore the apoſtle Paul ſays of the natural body
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017899_0008_0FA37C08C4547988"/>
with a view to illuſtrate the union, which ought to ſubſiſt between the members of the chriſtian church, is equally applicable to civil ſocieties. <hi>The body, ſays he, is not one member, but many. If the foot ſhall ſay, Becauſe I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? And if the ear ſhall ſay, Becauſe I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole body were hearing, where were the ſmelling? But now hath God ſet the members, every one of them in the body, as it hath pleaſed him.—The eye cannot ſay unto the hand, I have no need of thee; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. Nay, much more thoſe members of the body, which ſeem to be more ſeeble, are necesſary.—God hath ſo tempered the body together, —that there ſhould be no ſchiſm in it; but that the members ſhould have the ſame care one for another. And whether one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it; or one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.</hi> So that the union and connection between the ſeveral parts of the natural body, and their neceſſary dependance one on another, is an apt illuſtration of the great law of mutual ſubjection in civil
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017899_0009_0FA37C0946FF2340"/>
ſocieties; the members whereof, whether rich or poor, in high life or low, in office or out of it, ſtand in need of mutual aſſiſtance and ſupport; without which it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to promote the common intereſt, or to preſerve the peace and harmony of the whole.</p>
            <p>A man's being raiſed above others in wealth or office, does not render him inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on thoſe who are beneath him, in theſe reſpects. He cannot ſay, he has no need of thoſe, who are in a lower condition and meaner circumſtances; for, without Their aid and ſervice, he would loſe the advantage of his elevation; and, like Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhorn of his locks, become weak like other men.</p>
            <p>The mechanic and tiller of the ground are as neceſſary in ſociety as the legiſlator, civil magiſtrate, or any other profeſſion. The labours of the poor and ſervices of the lower claſſes of people, in their ſeveral callings and occupations, are of as great importance to the general welfare of a ſtate, as the counſel of the wiſe, the bounty of the rich, and protection of the powerful. If therefore any one, capable of attending to the common buſineſs of life, is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017899_0010_0FA37C09C1DBD098"/>
and uſeleſs member of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, it is not owing to any neceſſity ariſing from his outward condition in the world, but to ſome faulty cauſe.</p>
            <p>Whoever, ſuppreſſing a regard for the good of others, confines himſelf to the narrow circle of his own private intereſt, does thereby render himſelf, at beſt, a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to ſociety. Such an one can have no juſt claim to honour and reſpect, let his ſtation in life be what it will. It is not the external ſplendor of their circumſtances, but a conſtant endeavour to be good, and to do good, according to their abilities, that makes men truly great and honourable. In the ſight of God, who <hi>reſpecteth not perſons,</hi> but in judging of men regards only the moral differences between them, no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition is more honourable than another. The true criterion of real worth is a man's conduct, in that ſtation or poſt in life, whether conſpicuous or obſcure, which providence has allotted to him.</p>
            <p>It is the buſineſs of civil rulers, who are intruſted with the high powers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to enact and take care for the effectual execution of ſuch laws, as ſhall be beſt calculated to reſtrain the exorbitancy of the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017899_0011_0FA37C0A9C112A58"/>
human paſſions to guard individuals againſt inſults and outrages, and ſecure every one in the peaceable enjoyment of liberty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and all the bleſſings of ſociety. And while they employ their authority and power in purſuit of theſe great ends of their promotion, it is the duty and intereſt of people at large, to yield a chearful obedience to them, and a ready compliance with thoſe rules, regulations and laws, which are made and provided, for the benefit of each particular member, in harmony with the proſperity and welfare of the whole collective body.</p>
            <p>The grand end of ſocial union and of the inſtitution of civil government, is the good of the whole, and of every individual in conſiſtence therewith. This end may be fruſtrated, not only by an abuſe of power in rulers; but alſo by an abuſe of liberty in the people. Power abuſed ceaſes to be lawful authority, and degenerates into tyranny. Liberty abuſed, or carried to exceſs, is licenciouſneſs. Neither of theſe can conſiſt with the good of ſociety. The former, unreſiſted, will introduce ſlavery, and ignominious ſervitude, among the lower ranks and orders of people. The latter is a prolific ſource of diſorder and anarchy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:017899_0012_0FA37C0BD3754AF0"/>When rulers take the advantage of the powers they are veſted with, to oppreſs their ſubjects and rob people of their juſt rights, in order to inrich and aggrandize themſelves, they counteract the very end of their advancement, and inſtead of being <hi>miniſters of God for good,</hi> become rods of his ſchool for correction (not to ſay, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the devil for miſchief.) And when people, under presence of liberty, refuſe obedience to lawful authority, and oppoſe the meaſures of juſt government, meerly becauſe ſuch meaſures do not coincide with their private views and ſepa rate intereſts, the principles on which they act, are evidently inconſiſtent with a ſtate of ſociety, and lead directly back to a ſtate of nature. For where ſuch an exceſs of liberty is claimed and allowed, as leaves it optional with every individual to obey or diſobey the civil autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, according as he ſhall judge it to be for or againſt his particular intereſt, a ſtate of ſociety cannot differ much from a ſtate of nature.</p>
            <p>If every man, without compulſion, would ſtrictly conform to the obligations of natural law, there would be no occaſion for form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſocial connections, or uniting under any forms of civil government. But ſuch
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017899_0013_0FA37C0C04C1DD70"/>
is evidently the ſtate of human nature; ſuch the diſorder of the human paſſions; ſuch the power or envy, prejudice and a luſt of domination; ſuch the force of evil byaſſes, proceeding from ignorance, contracted views and competitions of intereſt; that without the introduction of ſocial compact and civil authority, mankind could have no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon mutual help and aſſistance, nor any ſecurity againſt abuſes and injuries, violence and rapine.</p>
            <p>It being neceſſary for men to unite in ſociety, and eſtabliſh civil government, in order effectually to avail themſelves of the advantages of mutual ſuccour, defence and protection; without which, their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would be few and precarious, and their inconveniences and dangers great and diſtreſſing: this being the caſe, every one, who has juſt conceptions of things (far from claiming a liberty to do whatever his ambition, avarice or partiality to himſelf might dictate to be right) muſt feel himſelf obliged to conſult the general welfare, by conforming to the laws of ſociety, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutionally made by public authority, for the good of the whole; though ſuch laws ſhould ſometimes interfere with his private views, and contradict his prejudices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:017899_0014_0FA37C0CC1917188"/>The public good is the attracting point, the common centre of gravity, which ſhould conſine, regulate and govern the motions of all the members of ſociety. When any fly off from this point and take an excentric courſe, the coercion of law ſhould be uſed, to check their irregular motions, and reduce them back to their proper centre, in order that the economy and beauty of the politic ſyſtem may be preſerved, and the bands of ſociety remain unbroken.</p>
            <p>That a due ſubordination may be kept up between the ſeveral parts of the politic body; and all the members thereof be made to conſpire, in the exerciſe of their reſpective functions, to the health and happineſs of the whole; effectual care ſhould be taken to prevent government from falling into contempt. To honour thoſe, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the powers of government, is one thing, evidently neceſſary for this end. This therefore is a duty which we owe to ſociety. And that people may have no excuſe for not doing their duty, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, it concerns all civil officers, eſpecially thoſe in high rank and authority, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their dignity, by a decent gravity of deportment, an inflexible adherence to the rules of juſtice and equity, and a ſteady
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017899_0015_0FA37C0D82E22CA8"/>
application to the buſineſs of their exalted ſtations. Such a conduct, in rulers, has a powerful tendency to attract eſteem, and command reſpect and veneration. But tho' they ſhould juſtly merit the higheſt honours, by a worthy behaviour, and a zealous uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form purſuit of the great ends of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, it would not be at all ſtrange, to find ſome few, diſpoſed to withold from them due reſpect and ſubmiſſion. For there always have been, and probably always will be, ſome in the world, who under the baneful influence of thoſe levelling principles, that cannot brook any civil diſtinctions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints, <hi>deſpiſe government,</hi> and <hi>ſpeak evil of dignities.</hi> Perſons of this deſcription are dangerous members of ſociety, as their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and practices are ſubverſive of all civil authority, and tend directly to plunge civil government into an univerſal wrack of ruin.</p>
            <p>It deſerves to be remembred, that we honour ſociety, when we honour thoſe, who are cloathed with lawful authority. For as all lawful authority in rulers, is derived from the people, through the medium of that conſtitutional compact, which binds them together in one body; ſo to treat the rulers of a people, with reſpect and hono<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017899_0016_0FA37C0E418F9110"/>
ſuitable to their public characters, and the offices which they ſuſtain, is a proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of that reverence, which individuals owe to the community, as a body. I may add, that as the reſpect ſhewn to thoſe, who are in public ſtations, redounds to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic; ſo it alſo tends to make a people appear reſpectable, and to give to government the energy, neceſſary for attaining the ends of it. On the contrary, to withold reſpect from thoſe, who have been conſtitutionally promoted to offices of authority and power, is to caſt a flight and contempt on the whole body of the people, and tends to make a ſociety appear mean and deſpicable, to relax the reins of government and undermine the very foundations of it.</p>
            <p>It is reaſonable indeed for a people to keep a jealous eye upon thoſe, who are betruſted with power, in the ſeveral departments of government. This is neceſſary to keep them on their guard againſt all encroachments on their liberties, and to preſerve them in a readineſs to reſiſt the firſt approaches of deſpotiſm. But ſuſpicions may be carried too far. When upon inſufficient grounds, they are indulged to ſuch a degree, as to deſtroy all confidence in civil rulers, and encourage the impatience of people under
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017899_0017_0FA37C0F02DE0A10"/>
the reſtraints of law, they are of dangerous conſequence; as they plant the feeds of fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a convulſive diſeaſe, that threatens the diſſolution of the body politic. When ſaction enters a ſtate, with its uſual train of virulence, malevolence and abuſive invective, it unſtrings the nerves of government, and introduces ſuch diſorder and uncertainty into public meaſures, and ſuch ſtrife and diviſion among people, as are inconſiſtent with the public ſafety, ſecurity and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This diſtemper is generally the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of envy and diſappointed ambition. Avarice always ſtands ready to foſter and nurſe, to increaſe and inflame it, by ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs criminations of men and meaſures; eſpecially when the public exigences require heavy taxes, and expenſive exertions.</p>
            <p>The inconveniences and miſchiefs, that muſt acrue to ſociety, from this, and every other groſs violation of the law of mutual ſubjection, are ſufficient to convince any one of the neceſſity of a ſtrict adherence to it. Our obligation to avoid diviſive principles and practices, and by a conſtant intercourse of mutual good offices, to endeavour to make ourſelves beneficial to one another and ſerviceable to ſociety, is therefore a plain dictate of reaſon and common ſenſe. I
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017899_0018_0FA37C0FC26EFC60"/>
would add (if any deſire further ſatisfaction) that this obligation is enforced upon us, in the ſacred ſcriptures, by the authority of the ſupreme Legiſlator and Governor of the world. The words at the head of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe are the words of an apoſtle, under the inſpiration of God. Another inſpired apoſtle expreſſes himſelf to the ſame purpoſe, in theſe words, <hi>Let no man ſeek his own; but every man another's wealth.—Look not every man on his own things; but every man alſo on the things of others.</hi> The meaning of which is, that men ought not to confine their views to their own private intereſt, but to extend their regards to the welfare of others, and exerciſe a benevolent concern and care for the good of their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatures.</p>
            <p>This alſo is a doctrine expreſsly taught by the great author of our holy religion, when he commands us to <hi>love our neighbour as ourſelves</hi>; and enjoins upon us that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive rule of equity and charity, <hi>All things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may not be improper to obſerve here, that the chriſtian religion recommends itſelf to the embraces of every lover of mankind,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017899_0019_0FA37C108295F8D8"/>
by its being the moſt benevolent inſtitution in the world, admirably calculated, by it's doctrines, precepts and ſanctions, to promote <hi>peace on earth,</hi> and <hi>good will among men.</hi> And whoever duly conſiders the nature of chriſtianity, and attends to it's adaptedneſs to ſuppreſs the corrupt luſts, and reſtrain the irregular paſſions of men; to fill the mind with noble ſentiments of piety and benevolence, and engage people in purſuits, ſuitable to the dignity, and conducive to the happineſs of their reaſonable natures; cannot doubt, but (other things being alike) he, who has imbibed the ſpirit and principles of this religion, will make a better magiſtrate, a better legiſlator, a better judge, and in ſhort, fill every office and department in government, with more honour to himſelf and advantage to the public; and, in private life, make a better ſubject and a better citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen; than one who has formed his views and ſentiments, upon any other ſyſtem of religion and morals.</p>
            <p>It has indeed been objected, as an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial defect in chriſtianity, by ſome not well affected to it, that it no where particularly recommends the noble virtue of patriotiſm. But (not to inſiſt on any thing elſe) it is ſufficient to reply to this objection, that
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017899_0020_0FA37C1141804318"/>
whatever there is excellent and laudable in patriotiſm, is included in that generous and diffuſive benevolence, which is the animating ſoul of this religion. Virtuous patriotiſm, far from implying any ill-will to the reſt of mankind, is nothing elſe, but the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or univerſal benevolence, exerciſed as far as a man's power extends, upon the objects that claim his firſt regards. For as no one has ability to carry his good will to all men into effect; ſo reaſon will teach every one, that his firſt obligation is to thoſe, with whom he is more immediately connected, and where providence has aſſigned him his ſtation and ſphere of uſefulneſs. Should a man ſuppreſs a particular affection for the ſociety, with which he is moſt cloſely united, and neglect the intereſt of his own country under pretence of exerciſing equal benevolence towards all mankind, it would be the ſame thing, in effect as to reſolve to be uſeleſs, and neglect the good of all. For there is no other way, in which any one can render himſelf ſerviceable to thoſe parts of the great community of mankind, with which he has no ſpecial connection, than by the exerciſe of an hearty zeal for the welfare of his own country, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring, in the moſt effectual manner, to promote the good of that ſociety, which
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017899_0021_0FA37C1202EC0FE8"/>
bounds the ſphere of his influence and power. In this ſenſe, and in this way, all men, in all the diſtinct ſtates and kingdoms of the world, may and ought to <hi>ſubject to one another.</hi> It is thus only that we can fulfil our obligations to all mankind.</p>
            <p>True it is, patriotiſm is but a blind affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and eſſentially defective as to any vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous excellence, if it prompts a man to defend the cauſe of his country, when his country forms itſelf into a faction againſt the rights of mankind, and is wickedly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to bring other ſtates and nations under it's arbitrary juriſdiction and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. No one, who will conſult the ſober dictates of reaſon, can ſuppoſe himſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to eſpouſe ſuch an unrighteous cauſe, or freely to afford any ſupport to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in the proſecution of ſuch an evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. The principle of benevolence to all, clearly forbids this. But the ſame principle obliges the members of every community, to a zealous exertion, in defence of their rights, laws and liberties, when the ſame are indangered by the unrighteous claims, and violent proceedings of ambitious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. In ſuch a caſe, defenſive war is a duty, founded not barely on the principles of ſelf-preſervation and patriotiſm, but
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017899_0022_0FA37C12C3992868"/>
alſo on the principle of unconfined univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal benevolence; it being evidently for the intereſt of all mankind, that in all parts of the world, thoſe ſhould be oppoſed, to the laſt extremity, who are endeavouring to advance themſelves upon the ruins or the eſſential rights of human nature.</p>
            <p>The man, who makes the happineſs and proſperity of his country, a grand object of his zealous purſuit, and generouſly riſques his life and fortune, when the caſe requires it, in the defence of it's conſtitution and laws, is a character worthy of univerſal eſteem and honour. Such an one, ſo far as his abilities extend, exerciſes friendſhip to all men. What then ſhall we ſay of thoſe who, when the rights and liberties of their country, are in danger of falling a prey to the aſpiring ambition of proud invaders, who have waged an unjuſt war againſt it, ſtand aloof, and not only refuſe to aſſiſt in ſaving it from ruin, but deſert it, and, of free choice, join the ſtandard of the enemy? Can ſuch perſons make good their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, I will not ſay to patriotiſm, but to general benevolence? Whatever be their motives, are they not to be viewed as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, if actions have any meaning? And ſhould their country, which they have thus

neglected, and abandoned to its fate in a time of trouble and danger, be ſucceſsful in its endeavours to maintain its cauſe, and defeat the deſigns of its enemies, muſt not their admiſſion afterwards to the freedom and privileges of it, be an act of meer favour and ſpecial grace, to which they can lay no equitable claim?<note n="*" place="bottom">It is far from the intention of the author to decide the queſtion, whether the faith of theſe ſtates is plighted by treaty, for the reſtoration of thoſe diſappointed people, who are commonly called abſentees, to the rights and privileges of citizenſhips He leaves the deciſion of this queſtion with thoſe, who have better means of information, and more diſcernment, than he can pretend to.

            </p>
            <p>Chriſtianity indeed obliges us <hi>to love</hi> and <hi>forgive our enemies,</hi> and do good to thoſe who treat us ill. But this obligation does not extend ſo far, as to exclude a regard to our own ſafety and defence. It would be unreaſonable to ſuppoſe, that our good-will to enemies, ought to ſupercede our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ourſelves and to our country; or that we are required to conſult their welfare,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:017899_0024_0FA37C14416F2448"/>
by methods that would encourage and promote their evil deſigns, and put us into ſuch a ſituation, as to lie at their mercy. It is allowed by all, that a vindictive temper is inconſiſtent with the ſpirit and precepts of chriſtianity. Whoever does any thing meerly for the ſake of revenge, or in order to gratify his malevolent reſentments, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes the chriſtian law of benevolence. But a man may take ſuch meaſures for his own ſecurity and defence, as ſhall operate to the diſadvantage of his enemies, and at the ſame time preſerve a chriſtian temper. If by the conduct of enemies, we are unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily reduced to this alternative, either to take ſuch meaſures, as will involve them in trouble and diſtreſs; or to ſuppreſs our love to ourſelves, to our friends, and to ſociety; common ſenſe will teach us on which ſide our obligation lies. In caſes of competition, even private friendſhip ought to yield to the public good; much more ought benevolence to an enemy to give way to the good of our country; and to remain ſuſpended, as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward exerciſes, when the caſe is ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced, that it cannot be thus exerted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out counteracting the intereſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity to which we belong. A regard to the public ought to ſwallow up every partial affection, inconſiſtent with the general intereſt.</p>

Unprompted by ambition to enlarge her ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories by unjuſt conqueſts, or to compel any other ſtates or kingdoms to ſubmit to her uſurped authority and government, America has contended only for the common rights of men.

Every patriot, from the higheſt to the loweſt order, has now an extenſive field opened before him, for the diſplay of his utmoſt abilities, in providing for the future peace and proſperity of his country. The conſequences of our conduct at this opportunity, will affect, not ourſelves only, but unborn millions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:017899_0034_0FA37C1BC19F38E0"/>Every conſideration proper to influence the human mind, obliges us to exert our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to make ſure of the bleſſings, which are now offered by the propitious hand of providence, and to tranſmit the ſame to ſucceeding generations. Should we neglect the means neceſſary for theſe purpoſes, the bright day, which now beams upon us, may ſoon be overcaſt with clouds; and our ſongs of triumph end in new ſcenes of ſorrow and trouble.</p>
            <p>The Britiſh troops are not yet removed. Their withdrawment, as ſoon as conveniency will permit, is neceſſary to give us full aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that the reconciliation on the part of Britain, is ſincere. Suſpicion therefore ſhould not ſleep, until they are withdrawn. Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, wiſdom, reaſon, require vigilance and caution, and oblige us to be on our guard.</p>
            <p>Though the land now <hi>reſts from war,</hi> and we daily expect to hear that the definitive treaty of peace is compleatly ratified, yet it would be exceedingly unſafe for people to lay by their arms, and neglect all military matters. Our country affords ſo many tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing objects to excite the ambition of other nations (eſpecially of thoſe, who can have eaſy acceſs, by reaſon of a proximity of territory)
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:017899_0035_0FA37C1C81011480"/>
that we can have no ſecurity of a laſting peace, or of enjoying long the bleſſings of freedom, if we ſhould totally withdraw our attention from the arts of war, and be unprovided with the means of defence. Standing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in a time of peace are indeed dangerous to liberty; but a well furniſhed and well diſciplined militia is of great importance to a ſtate, being neceſſary either to prevent a war, or to put people into a capacity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves againſt any invaſion or attack from their enemies. The public welfare requires that our militia be kept on ſuch a reſpectable footing, as ſhall render us ſecure at home, and formidable abroad. But leaving it to the wiſdom of our rulers to determine what is beſt in reference to this matter, let me obſerve, that</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of theſe ſtates are under the moſt ſacred obligations, not only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the happineſs of the ſtates, to which they reſpectively belong, by diſcountenancing all diſorders, ſuppreſſing thoſe vices, that are inconſiſtent with the intereſt of ſociety, and giving encouragement and ſupport to every virtue, upon which the peace, proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and ſtability of each ſtate, ſeparately conſidered, depend; but by endeavouring to ſtrengthen thoſe bands of union, which have
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:017899_0036_0FA37C1D42996F90"/>
connected the whole together, as one inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent nation. By ſolemn confederacy and compact every one is bound, to keep the good of all the ſtates in view, while he aims to promote the good of the particular ſtate with which he is more Immediately connected. In order to preſerve the union between the ſtates, and eſtabliſh it upon a permanent baſis, whatever is inconſiſtent with the principles, which, upon the matureſt deliberation, have been adopted, as the grand cement of it, muſt be carefully avoided; and a proper attention be paid to the intereſt and welfare of the whole. The ſeparate good of the ſeveral ſtates, is to be purſued only by ſuch meaſures, as ſhall harmonize with the good of all in the confederacy.</p>
            <p>Nothing did more encourage Britain to undertake and protract the late war, than a pres;umption, that it would be impoſſible for ſtates, ſo diſtant from one another; ſo differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, in many reſpects, in their education and manners; and between which, from ſituation and other circumſtances, there would often be an interference and compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of intereſt; to unite, or remain long united in one common cauſe. By mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing experience ſhe is now convinced of her miſtake; having ſeen the union gather ſtrength
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:017899_0037_0FA37C1E01190180"/>
and confirmation, under the overruling hand of providence, from the very meaſures which ſhe took, in hopes to break and deſtroy it. Chagrined at this diſappointment of our enemies, it is poſſible there may be ſome among us, who having always been diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to our cauſe, and all along endeavoured to alarm people's minds with preſages of diviſions and diſſenſions between the ſtates, may ſtill wiſh and hope to promote ſuch an event, left their reputation for foreſight ſhould ſuffer; as Jonah wiſhed for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Nineveh, left his prophetic abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities ſhould be called in queſtion. But ſhould any be ſo inimical as to attempt any thing of this ſort, by ſowing diſeord; foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing animoſities; endeavouring to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate unreaſonable jealouſies and ſuſpicions, or to nouriſh and ſtrengthen local prejudices; it is hoped there is wisdom, virtue and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution enough among the friends of the country, to defeat their evil deſigns, and (m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ugre the utmoſt efforts of every incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary and miſchief-maker) to preſerve the union unbroken, and the confederacy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inturrupted and intire.</p>
            <p>It is evidently of the greateſt importance to theſe ſtates, both conjunctly and ſeparately conſidered, to keep the public faith, ſacred
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:017899_0038_0FA37C1EC1C0CAA0"/>
and inviolate. This is a main pillar in the politic fabrick; without which the building muſt ſoon fall. This is neceſſary to gain us honour and confidence among other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to preſerve peace and union among ourſelves. Every one therefore is obliged to contribute his ſhare towards fulfilling the engagements and promiſes, made by lawful authority, in behalf of all the ſtates, or of the particular ſtate to which he belongs; that all, whether countrymen or foreigners, who have afforded or ſhall afford any aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or ſervice to the public, may receive juſtly expected rewards; and none have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain, that they have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved and injured, by depending on public faith. Should any be diſpoſed to violate their obligations, in this reſpect, the civil magiſtrate has undoubted authority, and ought to compel them to their duty; for if every one might be left at liberty, to do <hi>what is right in his own eyes,</hi> public credit would ſtand upon a precarious foundation, and be continually liable to be ſacrificed to the humour, caprice and avarice of individuals.</p>
            <p>Though public credit has been in a declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate, yet we are glad there is an hopeful proſpect of its recovery. What particular
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:017899_0039_0FA37C1F810F7FE8"/>
methods are beſt for placing it on a firm and durable baſis, I have not the vanity to think myſelf capable of determining. But it is conceived, no method can be adopted for this purpoſe, but what will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the aid of taxes, in ſome mode or other; and conſequently give umbrage to thoſe (if any ſuch there are) who never can be ſatisfied, unleſs they can enjoy the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of good government without coſt. But he, who has juſt conceptions of things, cannot ſure expect to enjoy the bleſſings of ſociety, or ſuppoſe it poſſible to ſupport the honour and credit of government, and attain the ends of it, without conſiderable expence, even in the moſt peaceable times; much leſs, in times of danger, difficulty and general calamity.</p>
            <p>It cannot be thought ſtrange, that a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing war, of eight years continuance, has involved us in a great debt. But conſidering the magnitude of the object, which we have had in purſuit, and the great exertions which we have been obliged to make in order to attain it, our debt is not ſo great, as might have been expected. Thoſe nations, which are now groaning under the iron yoke of oppreſſion, and deſpotic government, would think themſelves happy, if they could
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:017899_0040_0FA37C203B942AB0"/>
purchaſe the invaluable bleſſings of liberty, at ſo cheap a rate. There is yet another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which alone is ſufficient to ſilence all complaints, on this head. It is this, that if we had been reunited to Britain, and in addition to other expences, had had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional ſhare of her enormous debt laid upon us, it would have hung like a millſtone about our necks, and plunged us into inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table banckrupty, from which we never could have recovered ourſelves. Our preſent burden, tho' ſomewhat preſſing, is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively light. Let prodigality, luxury, and other impoveriſhing vices be baniſhed from among us; and let frugality, oeconomy and induſtry ſupply their place; and then conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering our means and reſources, it will not be ſo difficult to diſcharge our debt, in the courſe of a few years, as ſome may imagine. And while the legiſlature, in levying taxes, for this and other important purpoſes, take all poſſible care to make the burden as light as the public exigences will permit, and to adjuſt each man's ſhare of the public expence to his intereſt and circumſtances, every one, inſtead of indulging a murmuring temper, ſhould chearfully endeavour to defray his part, rejoicing that ſuch wile proviſion is made for <hi>judgment to run down as waters, and righteouſneſs as a mighty ſtream.</hi>

               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:017899_0041_0FA37C2101695FB8"/>Convinced of the neceſſity of a ſtrict re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to juſtice, for preſerving the credit of government, and mutual confidence between the members of a community, every true friend to ſociety will wiſh and endeavour to promote it, in all orders of men, from the higheſt to the loweſt. It is an obſervation of a king, as much celebrated for his wiſdom as magnificence, and may be laid down as a maxim, confirmed by the experience of all ages, that <hi>righteouſneſs exalteth a nation.</hi> According to the natural courſe of things, and common order of providence, that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety has the faireſt proſpect of proſperity, and laſting felicity, where government, firſt founded in equity, is adminiſtered according to the rules of impartial juſtice; and where truth, honeſty and fidelity are encouraged, maintained and promoted between man and man, in their private intercourſe and tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In this caſe, peace and harmony will prevail among the members of a ſociety; who will conſequently be in a ſuitable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to ſerve one another, and to unite in ſuch meaſures as the general intereſt ſhall, at any time, require. But when the oppoſite vices predominate; when faith and truth, uprightneſs and integrity take their flight; when juſtice is made a matter of traffick, and is bought and fold for money; when
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:017899_0042_0FA37C21C1FAED70"/>
deciet, falſhood, unrighteouſneſs and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion bear ſway without controal; then diſorder and confuſion, ſchiſm, tumult and miſery, may be expected as a natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence and effect.</p>
            <p>Though unrighteouſneſs may ſometimes anſwer a preſent purpoſe; yet follow it a little way, in it's conſequences, and it will be found to be the parent of difficulty and trouble of embarraſſment and perplexity. There can be no danger or hazard in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the rules of juſtice; but what is morally wrong can never be good policy, in reference either to public or private affairs.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more manifeſt, than that the intereſt of a people is greatly affected, by the virtues and vices prevalent among them. From hence the inference is obvious, that the morals of a people are among the great objects, which claim the particular attention of the legiſlature and civil authority. It evidently falls within their province, to provide means, by law, for the ſuppreſſion of vice and wickedneſs, and the promotion of good morals. In order effectually to anſwer theſe ends, care ſhould be taken for the diffuſion of learning and religion through a ſociety; that people may entertain juſt
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:017899_0043_0FA37C227B4D2AE8"/>
conceptions of the dignity and rights of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, and be early initiated in the principles of a ſober, honeſt and pious life. The general prevalence of ignorance and irreligion muſt be productive of very miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous effects in ſociety. For ignorant minds, unimpreſſed with a ſenſe of a Deity, of a providence and a future ſtate, muſt be unprincipled, and prepared, whenever occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions offer, for the moſt atrocious crimes. I would juſt add, that an ignorant people, are continually liable to be impoſed upon, and ſeduced into a ſurrender of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by the ſpecious arts, eloquence and addreſs of deſigning men. whoſe enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing ambition will not fail to lay hold on ſuch an advantage, for the acquiſition of power.</p>
            <p>Senſible of how great importance it is to the happineſs of a people, to be early in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the principles of piety and virtue, and furniſhed with good degrees of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, reſpecting the things of this world and that to come, our worthy anceſtors were induced to take effectual care for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and ſupport of the liberal arts and ſciences; for the preſervation of a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential ſenſe of a Deity on people's minds; for the inſtruction of all in religion and good
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:017899_0044_0FA37C23420522B8"/>
literature. Great and invaluable are the bleſſings, that have been derived to us, their poſterity, from their pious care, in theſe reſpects; a conſideration whereof ſhould provoke us to imitation; that as we have reaſon to honour their memory, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent proviſion they made for our happineſs and welfare, ſo our deſcendents may have equal reaſon to <hi>riſe up and call us bleſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our new conſtitution, while it has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided every guard, which human wiſdom can invent, to defend our liberties, civil and religious, againſt every encroachment of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power, has authorized but civil rulers to take care of the morals of people, by furniſhing them with the means of inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in virtue, piety and every branch of uſeful knowledge. They will therefore conſider themſelves as obliged to adopt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able meaſures for the encouragement of literature, the advancement of the ſciences, and the preſervation of a ſenſe of religion among all orders of men.</p>
            <p>To ſay nothing of other literary inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which claim the patronage of our political fathers, and of all the friends of ſcience; let me obſerve, that the laws pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for the eſtabliſhment of ſchools, in
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:017899_0045_0FA37C24006159E0"/>
our ſeveral towns and plantations, are wiſely calculated to promote the great ends of ſociety, by affording to all, the neceſſary means of education and inſtruction in the moſt important, uſeful and profitable branches of learning. But of what ſervice or ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cance are the beſt laws, while they lie dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, and may be tranſgreſſed with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? A law unexecuted is without life; and can anſwer no end, but to bring civil authority into diſrepute.</p>
            <p>As to laws obliging people to aſſemble for public worſhip, and provide themſelves with public teachers of religion; ſuch laws are evidently well adapted to promote the good order of civil government, and advance the happineſs of a people, by enforcing the uſe of proper means for impreſſing men's minds with an awe of the ſupreme Governor of the world, and engaging them from a ſenſe of their accountableneſs to him, to fulfil all moral obligation, and live in the practice of the virtues of a good life. And it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that ſuch laws can be no reaſonable ground of complaint, ſo long as the ſacred rights of conſcience are ſufficiently guarded and ſecured, by leaving people at liberty to chuſe their own teachers, and modes of worship; and while none are ſubjected to
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:017899_0046_0FA37C24C0CFEE78"/>
fines, forfeitures or any diſadvantages of a civil nature, for their particular religious ſentiments and profeſſion, if they be peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able members of ſociety, and do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate any doctrines, inconſiſtent with the ſafety of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>To carry the idea of religious liberty ſo far, as to make it an effectual hindrance to the providing and uſing neceſſary means, for the preſervation of a ſenſe of religion and moral obligation among the members of a community, is to oppoſe it to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of human ſociety, and to rob civil government of one of it's main ſupports. For the moſt powerful enforcements of obedience to civil authority, are derived from a conſideration and belief, that there is a ſupreme inviſible Power, preſiding over the world, to whom all men are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and who will reward or puniſh every man, in a future ſtate, <hi>according to his works.</hi> Obedience that proceeds wholly from fear of puniſhment from men, is precarious and uncertain; and will be withdrawn, upon the ſlighteſt temptations of pleaſure or profit, whenever a perſon believes, that he can eſcape with impunity. Religion therefore forms a more ſteady and permanent prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of obedience to civil government, than
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:017899_0047_0FA37C2605F52580"/>
any penal ſanctions, of a temporary nature, by which the laws of men can be enforced.</p>
            <p>It would evidently conduce greatly to the happineſs and tranquility of ſociety, and facilitate the adminiſtration of government and public juſtice, could people, in general, be perſuaded to ſubmit to the authority of the community, veſted in it's rulers, and to obey the laws, <hi>not only for wrath, but for conſcience ſake.</hi> It is not conceivable how any ſociety ſhould enjoy this advantage, where the public worſhip of God is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and no proper means made uſe of, for the inſtruction of people in piety, religion and morality.</p>
            <p>The deſign of the inſtitution of civil government being the good of the people, they who are intruſted with the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, ſhould make this the grand object of their attention and purſuit, and in the exerciſe of their conſtitutional powers, uſe all means and methods, that are of manifeſt importance and neceſſity to anſwer this end. This will make them a <hi>terror to evil doers,</hi> and an encouragement to them who do well. This will not only command a general reverence; but inſure to them the particular eſteem, aſſiſtance and ſupport of
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:017899_0048_0FA37C2687EC9468"/>
every true friend to the commonwealth; and cauſe the cenſures and calumnies of the envious, malicious and factious, to recoil on their own heads. This will make them public bleſſings and benefactors; and give them thoſe ſincere delights and ſupporting conſolations, which ariſe from reflections on ſuch good and uſeful actions, as have greatly contributed to the general intereſt and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and advanced the happineſs of ſociety.</p>
            <p>It might be tho't an inexcuſable omiſſion, ſhould I cloſe this diſcourſe, without paying a particular honourable attention to the worthy gentlemen, who have lately been veſted with the ſovereign powers of this commonwealth. Their promotion to ſuch high ſtations of authority, by the ſuffrages of a free people, gives them reſpectability, and entitles them to our confidence.</p>
            <p>It affords us ſingular pleaſure, that the higheſt ſeat in government, is filled, the fourth time, with a generous, uniform, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering and reſolute <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Our ſatisfaction on account of his being again choſen firſt magiſtrate of this commonwealth, would be without allay, on this occaſion, was he not prevented, by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, from honouring the ſolemnities of the day with his preſence.</p>
            <p>We are happy to find, that the ſecond rank in government, by the voice of the people, is again conferred on a gentleman, who, by an unwearied inflexible attachment to the cauſe of America, through all the hazzardous ſcenes of the late war, from firſt to laſt, has given full proof of his patriotiſm, and juſtify merited public reſpect and honour.</p>
            <p>We rejoice that ſo many other worthy characters, that have approved themſelves faſt friends to their country, in the most perilous times, are intruſted with a ſhare in the adminiſtration of government, and the important powers of legiſlation.</p>

will receive, of the eſteem and confidence of the people, by their election to ſuch high offices; muſt be an encouragement and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating motive to them, to improve the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages reſulting from their exalted ſtations, for the good of the public, the end of their advancement. We know that their buſineſs muſt be peculiarly difficult and arduous, at ſuch a day as this. Until the body politic ſhall be cured of thoſe diſtempers and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, which have been introduced by the convulſions of war, it will require great ſtrength and fortitude of mind, to hold the reins, and ſuſtain the burden of government. Great ſkill and wiſdom, great firmneſs and reſolution tempered with prudence, are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, at the preſent criſis; to retrieve public credit; to do equal juſtice to all; to quiet the agitations of people's minds; to put the affairs of the public into a proper train and arrangement; to repair the diſorders of the political machine, and adjuſt the wheels and ſprings of it, in ſuch a manner, that every part may anſwer its end, and contribute to the beauty, order and uſefulneſs of the whole. We therefore moſt heartily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our civil fathers to the bleſſing of that God, <hi>who giveth wiſdom to the wiſe, and underſtanding to the prudent.</hi> May the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, and all in authority, from the firſt

            <p>And let all people, of every claſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, ſeriouſly conſider, how much it behoves them to ſubmit to thoſe, who are in authority over them, and to conform to the conſtitution and laws of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, in order effectually to ſecure the bleſſings of civil government. While civil rulers are to be cautioned againſt an abuſe of authority, and exhorted to employ their powers for the good of the public; people are to be <hi>put in mind</hi> to honour and <hi>obey magiſtrates</hi>; to be <hi>ſubject unto the higher powers,</hi> and to <hi>ſubmit themſelves to every ordinance of man, for the Lord's ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When people give way to a refractory temper; ſet themſeles up in oppoſition to government; and by continual groundleſs invectives, endeavour to bring an odium upon their rulers, and upon all public mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; they take a direct method to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw ail civil authority, and to diſband and aboliſh ſociety. Let people be vigilant and guarded againſt the encroachments of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power; but let them, at the ſame time, take heed, that they deprive not themſelves of the bleſſings of good government, and

plunge themſelves into all the diſorders and miſchiefs of anarchy, in order to ſecure themſelves againſt tyranny. This would be as prepoſterous, as for a mariner to ſuffer voluntary ſhipwreck upon the rocks of Seilly, in order to avoid the dangers of Charybdis. No wiſe man will run into one extreme, in order to avoid its oppoſite, while he can ſteer ſafely, in a middle courſe, between both.</p>
            <p>Senſible of the importance of good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the true friends of ſociety will chearfully ſubmit to lawful authority, and endeavour to encourage and ſupport thoſe, who are in public ſtations, in the execution of their high offices, for the public good.

            <p>And let it be remembered, that by the virtues of a good life, added to their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious devotions and acts of homage and worſhip, the people put themſelves under the protection and patronage, and ſecure the

A people under the ſmiles of Heaven muſt be proſperous and happy. <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What happineſs might we enjoy, as a people, and as individuals, if every one would reform his vices; cultivate a meek, peaceable and benevolent ſpirit; and uſe his beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to promote the good of others, as well as his own? What bleſſings might we procure to ourſelves and to the community, if with one heart and one ſoul, we would apply ourſelves to the duties, that we owe to one another, as brethren and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citizens, and make it our buſineſs to fulfil all moral, ſocial and civil obligations? By thus doing, at the ſame time that we ſhould brighten our proſpects into the future world, and, through the merits of our moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Redeemer, provide for immortal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs in another ſtate of exiſtence, we might alſo ſecure to ourſelves all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of ſociety on earth, and change this world into a ſort of paradiſe.</p>

               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:017899_0054_0FA37C2A012F7398"/>We have therefore every inducement ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to work upon us as rational creatures, to engage us to conform to the rules of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and comply with the great and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive law of ſubjection to one another. Let us lay our minds open to the ſacred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of ſuch mighty motives, that we may be happy in our connections, both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and private, in this world; and in the world to come, be admitted to the ſociety of thoſe bleſſed beings, who, knit together by the indiſſoluble ties of the moſt ſincere and ardent love, have happy and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted experience of the moſt pure, perfect and ſublime pleaſures of friendſhip, for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>May the benevolent Parent and ſupreme Ruler of the univerſe beſtow his benediction on us; unite our hearts in love to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in the love of virtue; and diſpoſe us to <hi>keep all his commandments always</hi>; that, the ſcenes of our troubles cloſed, we may ſee good days; rejoice in the happy effects of his favour to us, and in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing proſpects of the bleſſedneſs and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of our deſcendents, to the lateſt generation.</p>
