            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I AM not ignorant that the ſtyle of dedications in general, is that of panegyric, where the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor endeavours to elevate the

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>AS a perſon of ſenſibility, whom bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs or neceſſity, forces into the houſe of an entire ſtranger, (eſpecially if that ſtranger is his ſuperior in genius, education or rank,) experiences a ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion undeſcribably painful, in being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiated to announce himſelf, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the intent of his viſit: ſo I feel myſelf inexpreſſibly embarraſſed and timid, whilſt performing the unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able taſk of writing a Preface. It is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing myſelf to, and calling up the attention of a multiplicity of ſtrangers; it is introducing not myſelf indeed, but what is nearly the ſame thing, the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of my imagination, to their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and conſcious as I am, that it will
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:029439_0012_0FE29F106EBAF788"/>
be peruſed by thoſe, who are infinitely my ſuperiors, this awkward timidity encreaſes, to an almoſt unconquerable degree.</p>
                  <p>"The works of fiction," ſays Dr. Johnſon, <q>with which the preſent ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration ſeems more particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted; are ſuch as exhibit life in its true ſtate, diverſified only by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents that daily happen in the world, and influenced by paſſions and qualities, which are really to be found in converſing with mankind. In narratives, where hiſtorical vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city has no place, I cannot diſcover why there ſhould not be exhibited a moſt perfect idea of virtue, not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, nor above probability; for what we cannot credit, we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver imitate; but the higheſt and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that humanity can reach, which exerciſed in ſuch trials as the various revolutions of things ſhall bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, may, by conquering ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, and enduring others, teach us what we may hope, and what we can perform.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:029439_0013_0FE29FEAC851E5E8"/>
Upon this plan I have endeavoured to form the "Trials of the Human Heart." My Heroine, though not wholly free from error, (for where ſhall we find the human being that is ſo?) I truſt is not altogether unworthy imitation. Through various trying ſituations, as daughter, wife, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; I have ſtrove to conduct her with propriety, tempering the weakneſs of humanity with the patience and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a Chriſtian, and that dignified pride, which will ever ariſe from a juſt ſenſe of the moral virtues.</p>
                  <p>It is with reluctance I find myſelf obliged to remark, that the literary world is infeſted with a kind of loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome reptile, of the claſs of non-deſcripts, for it cannot be ranked with proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty amongſt either authors or critics, not poſſeſſing the qualifications neceſſary to form either, and being in itſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for nothing but its noxious qualities: its only aim is to prevent the ſucceſs of any work of genius; and ſwelling with envy, ſhould the ſmalleſt part of public favour, be conferred on
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:029439_0014_0FE29FF03383D208"/>
another, ſpits out its malignant poiſon, in ſcurrility and detraction. One of theſe noiſome reptiles, has lately crawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the volumes, which I have had the temerity to ſubmit to the public eye. I ſay <hi>crawled over</hi> them, becauſe I am certain it has never penetrated beyond the title-page of any.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it would be as well, did I ſuffer this circumſtance to paſs unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed; the arguments uſed, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, are unanſwerable, being in ſome parts incomprehenſible, and in others of ſuch a nature, that no woman can glance her eye over them, without feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bluſh of offended delicacy crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon her cheek. Yet, as I have been accuſed of writing in an improper ſtyle in my Novel of the "Fille de Chambre," and of expreſſing ſentiments foreign to my heart, in my Comedy of "Slaves in Algiers," I think it neceſſary to aſſure the candid and impartial public, that both theſe aſſertions are equally falſe and ſcandalous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xv" facs="unknown:029439_0015_0FE29FF565396370"/>
Though many a leiſure hour has been amuſed, and many a ſorrowful one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled, whilſt giving Fancy the reins, I have applied myſelf to my pen, it has ever been my pride, that I never yet wrote a line that might tend to miſlead the untutored judgment, or corrupt the inexperienced heart; and heaven for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid I ſhould ſuffer ought to eſcape my pen, that might call a bluſh to the cheek of innocence, or deſerve a glance of diſpleaſure from the eye of the moſt rigid moraliſt.</p>
                  <p>As to my opinion of the political concerns of America, or my wiſhes in regard to her welfare, I cannot better explain them, than by giving a ſlight ſketch of my private hiſtory, with which, I rather imagine, the <hi>creature</hi> alluded to, is entirely unacquainted.</p>
                  <p>It was my fate, at a period when memory can ſcarcely retain the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt trace of the occurrence, to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny my father, (Mr. William Haſwell, who is a lieutenant in the Britiſh navy) to Boſton in New England, where he
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:029439_0016_0FE29FF70E469E08"/>
had married a ſecond wife, my mother having loſt her life in giving me exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Bleſt with a genteel competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and placed by his rank and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that ſphere of life, where the polite and friendly attentions of the moſt reſpectable characters courted our acceptance, and enjoying a conſtant intercourſe with the families of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Britiſh army and navy, then ſtationary there, eight years of my life glided almoſt imperceptibly away.</p>
                  <p>At that time the diſſentions between England and America encreaſed to an alarming degree: my father bore the king's commiſſion, he had taken the oath of allegiance; certain I am that no one who conſiders the nature of an oath, voluntarily taken, no one who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects, that previous to this period, he had ſerved thirty years under the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh government, will blame him for a ſtrict adherence to principles which were interwoven as it were with his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtance. He did adhere to them, the attendant conſequence may readily
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:029439_0017_0FE29FF88FC41260"/>
be ſuppoſed; his perſon was confined, his property confiſcated.</p>
                  <p>Then it was that the benevolence and philanthropy, which ſo eminently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the ſons and daughters of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbia made an indeliable impreſſion on my heart, an impreſſion which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time or chance can obliterate, for while their political principles obliged them to afflict, the humanity, the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian like benevolence of their ſouls, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited them to wipe the tears of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from the eyes of my parents, to mitigate their ſufferings, and render thoſe afflictions in ſome meaſure ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable. Would to Heaven it was in my power to render their memories as immortal, as my gratitude is unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Having been detained as a priſoner two years and an half, part of which was ſpent in <hi>Hingham,</hi> and part in <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington;</hi> an exchange of priſoners tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place between the Britiſh and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans, my father and his family were ſent by cartel to Halifax, from whence
<pb n="xviii" facs="unknown:029439_0018_0FE2A00085D996D0"/>
we embarked for England. I will not pretend to deſcribe the ſorrow I experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, in being thus ſeparated from the companions of my early years: every wiſh of my heart was for the welfare and proſperity of a country, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſuch dear, ſuch valuable friends, and the only comfort of which my mind was capable, was indulging in the delightful hope, of being at ſome future period permitted again to reviſit a land ſo beloved, companions ſo regretted.</p>
                  <p>Too young at that time, to have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any political principles of my own, I may naturally be ſuppoſed to have adopted thoſe of my father, but the truth is, that equally attached to either country, the unhappy diſſentions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected me in the ſame manner as a perſon may be imagined to feel, who having a tender lover, and an affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate brother who are equally dear to her heart, and by whom ſhe is equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, ſees them engaged in a quarrel with, and fighting againſt each other, when, let whichſoever party conquer,
<pb n="xix" facs="unknown:029439_0019_0FE2A00219568AB0"/>
ſhe cannot be ſuppoſed inſenſible to the fate of the vanquiſhed.</p>
                  <p>During a period of twelve years a variety of painful circumſtances unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary here to recount, contributed to deprive me of a decent independence inherited from my paternal grandfather, and at length to bring me back to America, in a very different ſituation, I muſt confeſs, from that in which I left it; but with a heart, ſtill glowing with the ſame affectionate ſenſations, and exulting in its evident improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the arts are encouraged, manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures increaſe, and this happy land bids fair to be in the courſe of a few years the moſt flouriſhing nation in the univerſe.</p>
                  <p>Is it then wonderful, that accuſtomed from the days of childhood, to think of America and its inhabitants with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, linked to them by many near connections, and ſincerely attached to them, from principles of gratitude, that I ſhould offer the moſt ardent prayers for a continuation of their proſperity,
<pb n="xx" facs="unknown:029439_0020_0FE2A003A4640E28"/>
or that feeling the benign influence of the bleſſings of peace and liberty, here ſo eminently enjoyed, I ſhould wiſh that influence extended throughout eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nation under heaven.</p>
                  <p>Before I conclude, I beg leave to ſay a few words more, concerning my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent publication. I am willing to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf, that in offering this novel to the public, I am not preparing for my future life, either ſhame or repentance. That it is throughout the whole, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily imagined or highly poliſhed, I have not ſufficient confidence in my own abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to warrant; but whatever may be my final ſentence from the world in general, I have at leaſt endeavoured to deſerve their kindneſs, nor ſhall I envy the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours which wit and learning obtain in any other cauſe, if I may be ſo happy as to awaken in the boſoms of my youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful readers, a thorough deteſtation of vice, and a ſpririted emulation, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and follow the precepts of Piety, Truth and Virtue.</p>

                     <p>WILL you believe me, Celia, when I tell you, I wiſh I was at Bologne again; that I am diſſatisfied and unhappy. You are ſurpriſed. It is nevertheleſs certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true. We formed erroneous opinions of the world; we thought it a paradiſe compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſolemnity and gloom of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. Truſt me, my dear, I have as yet found nothing, in this gay, buſy world, half ſo
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:029439_0022_0FE2A00D88152338"/>
pleaſing, as that ſweet retirement. But I forget that this is my firſt letter, and that you naturally wiſh to know every incident which has happened ſince our ſeparation. This innocent curioſity ſhall be gratified, and to begin:</p>
                     <p>During our journey, Mr. Verdome inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me that the reaſon of my being ſent for home ſo ſuddenly, was to attend Mrs. Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van, my godmother, who had been for a long time ill, and was ſuppoſed to be in a deep decline. "She went to Briſtol," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, "a few days before I left England; your mother accompanied her, your father and Mrs. Talbot were to follow the enſuing week; we ſhall, therefore, on our arrival in England, ſet forward immediately for that place.</p>
                     <p>"Who is Mrs. Talbot?" ſaid I.</p>
                     <p>"She is," replied Mr. Verdome, "a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow lady, who, being left in rather indigent circumſtances, and being a diſtant relation of the family, has accepted an aſylum in your father's houſe."</p>
                     <p>"If ſhe is an amiable woman," ſaid I, "my mother muſt be happy in having ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="3" facs="unknown:029439_0023_0FE2A00F236B8528"/>
"She is ſenſible, well bred, and good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured," he replied—and here the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dropped.</p>
                     <p>I was, as you may eaſily imagine, too much taken up with the diſagreeable ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſea-ſickneſs, to be able to reflect much, while croſſing the channel: but no ſooner was I in the chaiſe, proceeding toward Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol, than I began to form a thouſand differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ideas about meeting my parents, not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen either of them ſince I could remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. I pictured them to myſelf, as very amiable old people—and, in fancy, felt their embraces and kiſſed off the tears of joy I ſaw falling from their eyes. Celia, we children of ſimplicity form ſtrange enthuſiaſtic no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In thinking of my dear Mrs. Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van, I felt more lively ſenſations; becauſe I was certain if ſhe lived, when I arrived, I ſhould be received by her with heart-felt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and ſhould I find her no more, my own heart would experience the moſt acute anguiſh. You muſt remember how much I am indebted to her tenderneſs and affection, and how very happy I was whenever ſhe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited our convent.</p>
                     <p>At length we arrived at the end of our journey. I trembled ſo, that I could ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupport myſelf. Expectation, hope, fear,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:029439_0024_0FE2A010A5E9A870"/>
by turns were predominant in my boſom. When we ſtopped, a handſome man, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance about five and thirty or forty years of age, handed me from the chaiſe, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting me, ſaid to Mr. Verdome, "faith ſhe is a very fine girl." I ſaw Mr. Verdome frown; but had not time to make any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remarks, before I found myſelf in the chamber of my godmother. Oh Celia! how that dear woman was altered; her face pale, eyes ſunk and ſo reduced that ſhe could not riſe to meet me. She faintly ſmiled when I entered the room, I could not ſpeak. I ſaw nothing, thought of nothing, but her; and running to her threw my arms round her neck and burſt into tears. "Dear creature," ſaid Mrs. Mirvan (embracing me) "we have ſurpriſed her. She was not prepared to ſee me thus, but come, my love, dry your tears; here is another lady, who indeed ſhould have been the firſt object of your attention." I turned round and beheld the moſt beautiful woman, you can conceive, bending over me, her eyes full of tears. "My child, my belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Meriel," ſaid ſhe, taking me in her arms; "have you no recollection of your mother?" Whilſt I was folded in her maternal embrace the door opened, and my mother continued, "come Mr. Howard welcome your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter." I raiſed my head from my dear mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's boſom, and was ſurpriſed to ſee the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:029439_0025_0FE2A0125EBB0508"/>
ſame gentleman, who had handed me from the chaiſe. "Your father, Meriel," ſaid my mother. I bent one knee to the ground and kiſſed his hand. But ſhall I confeſs that whilſt in that action, which ſhould have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed filial reſpect and love, I felt more of terror than either.</p>
                     <p>"Riſe girl, riſe," ſaid he, "I have no taſte for theſe fine romantic ſcenes. You knelt, becauſe you were told it would be expected, not from any genuine impulſe of the heart." My poor mother looked diſtreſſed. "I hope," ſaid I, in a faultering voice, "I hope, ſir, my conduct will henceforth convince my dear parents, that I am wanting in neither duty nor affection." "We ſhall ſee," ſaid he, careleſsly. "You women in general talk well, but as to your obedience and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when you are put to the trial you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fall far ſhort of your profeſſions." I ſaw the tears ſtand in my mother's eyes. Oh! cried the unfeeling man, if you are for a whimpering party, I ſhall leave you to yourſelves, and go and finiſh my game at piquet with Mrs. Talbot.</p>
                     <p>When he was gone, I felt myſelf relieved, and entered into converſation with my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mrs. Mirvan: though I could not but obſerve the hard ſtruggle my dear pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

had to repreſs her tears; I dared not notice her diſtreſs, leaſt by ſo doing, I ſhould increaſe it: beſides I judged, that however palpable my father's errors might be, it would be an ungrateful ſubject to her, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from the lips of a child.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt few days after my arrival, we flattered ourſelves, that Mrs. Mirvan was much better; but this enchanting illuſion ſoon vaniſhed. We had been one morning chatting on her evident amendment, and ſhe told me, when able to ſupport the fatigue of a journey, ſhe would go to the ſouth of France, and I ſhould accompany her. She wiſhed my mother to go; but that dear good woman, ſays ſhe, can never leave your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſo long a time, (and his fortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but ſmall will not allow the whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take ſuch a journey.) At dinner time, ſhe eat the wing of a chicken, and ſeemed to eat with an appetite; after which ſhe drank a glaſs of Madeira; and in a ſhort time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of drowſineſs, laid down on the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha: my mother retired to her own room, and I took up a volume of Pope's Homer, to amuſe myſelf. For ſome time, her ſleep ſeemed compoſed, but ſhe ſoon grew reſtleſs, breathed quick, and frequently ſtarted, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry now and then fetching a deep ſigh, which terminated in a kind of convulſive groan. I
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029439_0027_0FE2A01BE6D6AC38"/>
was alarmed and rang the bell, but before any one anſwered it, I perceived my belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed godmother was in ſtrong convulſions; my ſhrieks brought the whole family to the room; a phyſician was ſent for, but alas! nothing could be done. She was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately put to bed; but never recovered her ſenſes until a few moments before the final ſcene cloſed. In that ſhort interval, ſhe bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned my mother towards her, and putting my hand in hers, thus addreſſed me, though with difficulty. "Meriel, you are the only comfort that dear ſuffering ſaint poſſeſſes; let mutual friendſhip cement the bonds of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection; my child never forſake your mother, ſo ſhall the father of mercies never forſake you." I claſped my arms round my weeping parent, and articulated a vow to heaven, never to let her know a grief or pain, it was in my power to remove. My fortune, my peace of mind, my reputation, my life, every thing but integrity of heart, ſhould be ſacrificed to inſure her felicity. "Enough, my child," faintly cried Mrs. Mirvan, "the Creator of the univerſe has heard, and accepts your vow. Oh Meriel!" continued ſhe, after a pauſe, "let it be thro' life ever preſent to your memory, that you muſt one day be as I am now, trembling on the verge of eternity. Love thy Maker above all things, and thy fellow creatures a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

thyſelf; 'tis that alone can ſupport"—She could articulate no more, but her lips ſtill moved. She claſped her hands earneſtly; raiſed her eyes toward thoſe bliſsful regions to which her pure ſoul aſpired, and with a placid ſmile ſunk to eternal reſt.</p>
                     <p>"Oh!" ſaid I, as I dropped on my knees by her bed ſide, "let me live a life of puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that my death may be like hers." Amen, amen, cried my mother, as ſhe raiſed me from the ground. We retired to her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where claſped in each others arms, we pour'd forth that tribute of affliction, the merits of our loſt friend demanded.</p>

Mrs. Talbot conducted herſelf with great propriety, exerted herſelf to comfort and cheer my mother, tho' I cannot tell why that dear woman did not receive her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with that grateful ſweetneſs, which ſhe ever manifeſted to others. I think Mrs. Talbot a moſt engaging woman. She is not ſo handſome as my mother, but has a great deal more vivacity. She is tall, well made, and has a very expreſſive countenance, is affable, conciliating and extremely ſenſible; ſhe is ſo kind as to aſſiſt and direct my ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. You know I am very fond of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hiſtory. She frequently reads to me, and afterwards we ſaunter thro' the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, fields and meadows in ſearch of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to illuſtrate what we have read. In theſe rambles my mother accompanies us, but it grieves me to ſee ſuch a ſettled me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy impreſſed upon her countenance. My brother Richard yeſterday came from ſchool for a few days. I can percieve he is my father's favourite, indeed my mother is extremely partial to him, tho' it is with pain.

I felt my heart drawn toward him by an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable impulſe. I therefore on hearing of his arrival, ran down ſtairs and was going to welcome him with a cordial embrace, but the frigid coldneſs that his countenance diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played repreſſed my ardour. He advanced, juſt touched my cheek and bowing profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wiſhed me joy of my fortune. "Joy,! brother ſaid I, indeed I have not thought of any thing but regret, for the ſad occaſion of my becoming miſtreſs of this fortune; would to heaven! dear Mrs. Mirvan were ſtill alive to enjoy thoſe few thouſands, the acquiſition of which cannot compenſate to me for the loſs of her valuable ſociety." "She was to be ſure a good old woman," ſaid he, careleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, "but you know ſiſter, ſhe was very infirm, ſo I think ſhe is much happier out of the world than in it." "Come, come Richard," ſaid my mother with a look, half ſmiling, half frowning, "I muſt not hear you ſpeak lightly of an event, which has ſo highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed us all." Maſter Richard ſmiled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly, turned on his heel, hummed a tune and walked out of the room. How happens it, Celia, that the child of a woman poſſeſſed of ſuch an excellent heart, and ſuch exquiſite ſenſibility ſhould be ſo very unfeeling; perhaps you will ſay he cannot reſemble both parents; true, too true, it is a juſt remark; but oh how ſuperlatively.

happy would be my lot if both thoſe parents reſembled each other.</p>
                     <p>We live very retired, my father's income will not ſuffer him to aſſociate with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er claſs of inhabitants of the village, and his pride keeps him from thoſe in the middling or lower walks of life. We are, therefore, viſited by very few, nor among thoſe few have I ſeen one, with whom my heart would claim acquaintance. Surely, Celia, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

There are two families whom my mother is permitted to viſit, and there are daughters in each family: but whenever we meet, which indeed is but ſeldom; they have ſo much to tell me concerning their lovers, their dreſſes and their petty differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with each other, that we have not a moment for rational converſation.</p>
                     <p>By this account you will naturally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my time cannot paſs in the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner.

                     <p>MERIEL is returned from the continent, where ſhe has been from a ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy immured in a gloomy convent. Mrs. Howard did not think her own family a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place for the tuition of a girl. She was right: her huſband is by no means a brilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant example, and I think, it would be a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate circumſtance for young Howard was any thing to happen that might ſeperate him from his father. Meriel is not what is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally termed a fine girl; ſhe is rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the middle ſize, and inclined to <hi>on bon point;</hi> her face is not regularly pretty, but ſhe has a lovely pair of hazel eyes, through which you may read every emotion of her ſoul. She is fair, a fine glow of health ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates her face, and a ſmile of good humour plays about her mouth; a luxuriant quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of cheſnut hair hangs in ringlets down

her neck and ſhades a forehead that is orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the moſt beautiful eye-brows I ever beheld. Yet ſhe is not ſtriking at firſt ſight, indeed, you would rather be tempted to ſay ſhe was plain, but the moment ſhe ſpeaks you muſt be charmed. I have heard women ſing who have fine voices; but I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hear Meriel read a pathetic tale than liſten to the fineſt ſingers in England. The melody of her voice, is ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I could not have believed it poſſible for a girl of ſixteen to be ſo artleſs and innocent. An entire ſtranger to deception, ſhe ſeeks not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe one emotion of her heart. She loves neither her father nor her brother. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not blame her, their ſouls are not congeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al with her own. Yet does ſhe ſtrive by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and attention to attone for the defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency. I am ſo charmed with this dear girl, who is a brilliant model of her mother's vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; with this difference, Mrs. Howard's are paſſive virtues: Meriel's will prove active ones. I am ſo captivated with her gentle innocence that I find I can no longer remain in the family: Lucetta aid me to fly from infamy, from ſhame, from a black train of evils that I ſee ready to encompaſs me. You

                     <p>CELIA, if you value your own happineſs never deſire to quit the convent. When I was there, I imagined my father a worthy character. Had I never left it, I had never been undeceived: indeed, it is a ſad, ſad thing to reflect on, but this man, whom nature, religion, every ſacred tie obliges me to reſpect and love: this very man is a libertine, and an infidel. He came
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:029439_0036_0FE2A0396DEFC400"/>
one Sunday morning into the library, where I was reading. "Well my pretty roſe-bud," ſaid he, for he generally calls me by ſome ſuch unaccountable name; "What are your ſtudies?" "Rowe's letters," I replied. "What do you read ſuch ſtuff as that for?" cried he, pulling the book out of my hand, "'Tis time enough for you to read ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious nonſenſe ſome forty or fifty years hence, and here is that ſtupid fellow Harvey too," continued he, taking up a book that lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the table. "Why child, theſe ridiculous books are enough to turn your head; they might have done well enough in a convent, but ſurely you may find ſomething more amuſing in this collection." "I read theſe ſerious authors by choice, ſir," ſaid I. "You have a ſtrange taſte for a girl of your age then," he replied, "but I don't believe you ſpeak as you think. Come tell me honeſtly, Meriel," continued he ſitting, down beſide me, "did you never get any novels or ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances in the convent?" You may ſuppoſe I ſtared at him, for you know we never ſaw a book of the kind, during the whole time we were together; of this I aſſured him: to which he replied; "then that eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for my taſte." He then began to ſpeak of religion, and the ſacred writings in a manner that made me tremble. At firſt, I thought he meant only to try me; but
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029439_0037_0FE2A03AF04ADAA0"/>
finding the more I oppoſed his ſentiments, the ſtronger were the arguments he advanced to confute, as he ſaid, "my fooliſh bigotry, to a ſubject which was not worthy the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of any but old women and children." I roſe from my ſeat and burſting into tears, cried, "oh! ſir, if theſe are indeed your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents they ſhock me to the ſoul." "Come girl, come don't cry," ſaid he, pulling me toward him; "you muſt try to get the better of theſe ſuperſtitious notions, and learn to think and act for yourſelf, unbiaſed by the prejudices of others." I could not anſwer for my tears. He took me in his arms and kiſſed me; but my ſoul ſhrunk back from his embrace. My mother juſt then paſſing the window, he left me and went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the garden to join her. I do not like this Mrs. Talbot, ſo well as I did at firſt; I ſaw my father take a liberty with her yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day when they thought they were unobſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There was an impropriety in it, which made me ſhudder; and a thought darted acroſs my mind which almoſt ſtunned my faculties: ſurely they cannot be ſo very abandoned. Oh my poor mother! I fear, this too well explains the cauſe of your tears and dejection.</p>

                     <p>It is as I ſuſpected, Mrs. Talbot is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy woman. This morning, I aroſe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier than common, intending, the weather being ſine, to walk into the meadows, before breakfaſt, paſſing my mother's chamber door I ſaw it was partly open; and, looking in, I percieved my dear mother raiſed upon her elbow in the bed, the tears ſtreaming down her face, and ſobbing, as tho' her heart would break. Unable to reſtrain myſelf, I ruſhed into the room and ardently requeſted to know the cauſe of her grief. She haſtily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to dry her tears and compoſe her countenance, aſſured me that nothing parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular was the matter, but that ſhe often was ſeized with thoſe involuntary fits of weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for which ſhe could aſſign no cauſe. "Oh! my dear mother," ſaid I, "you cannot thus deceive a child, who loves you as I do. Long have I noticed the anxiety that weighs heavy at your heart, and preys upon your ſpirits. Can you, do you think your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unworthy to be truſted with your ſorrows. Believe me I will treaſure them in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom as a ſacred depoſit, and having eaſed your labouring breaſt of the painful burthen will pour into it the balm of conſolation." "My dear girl, my only comforter, ſaid my mother; ſeek not to know what will only"
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:029439_0039_0FE2A046902813F0"/>
make you unhappy, I cannot be more ſo than I am already, ſaid I, for how is it poſſible I can be at peace when you are the victim of concealed anguiſh? "Oh! my child, ſaid ſhe, I cannot explain to you the nature of my ſorrows, without acuſing one, whom it is your duty to reſpect, I muſt not make my child diſpiſe her father;" "I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe him, I replied. If he can injure good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs like your's I will pity and pardon him, and pray to heaven to turn his heart." But where is my father. He has been out all night ſaid my mother. While you were at Mr. Rowley's yeſterday, he went out and has not returned ſince. Juſt then I heard a chaiſe drive up to the door and looking out ſaw my father alight and hand out Mrs Talbot; the myſtery is unravelled ſaid I; "go, ſaid my mother, dry your eyes and appear at breakfaſt as compoſed as you can; do not let them have the triumph of ſeeing how much they diſtreſs us. I did as I was deſired, but when I entered the breakfaſt parlour, I felt a glow of indignation fluſh my cheek, and I could hardly give them the compliments of the morning with any ſteadineſs of accent. Mrs. Talbot fixed her penetrating black eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my face; I darted at her a look of anger, ſhe immediately caſt them down, turned pale and ſeemed much agitated; but whether it was with anger or ſenſibility I cannot determine.</p>

                     <p>This Mrs. Talbot is a wonderful woman: her conduct is an inexplicable riddle; her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter undefinable. With ſome of the fineſt ſentiments that can elevate human nature, and with the power to act up to thoſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments', ſhe has ſunk herſelf upon a level the meaneſt of her ſex. I at one and the ſame moment admire, love, pity and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe her: but I will inform you of the cauſe of theſe contradictory ſentiments. Yeſterday afternoon as my mother, Mrs. Talbot and myſelf were at tea, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came in from a walk and throwing a folded paper into Mrs. Talbot's lap, told her he had met with a travelling pedlar and had brought her a preſent. She unfolded the paper, and ſeeing a piece of fine chintz, enquired if there was enough for two gowns. "No," ſaid my father, "I bought but one." "Then certainly, Sir, you did not mean it for me; only your politeneſs leads you to offer it; permit me to reſign it to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per owner," laying it on my mother's knee. "Then, you refuſe my preſent, Kate," ſaid my father ſternly. "I do indeed," ſays ſhe, with firmneſs, "and am reſolved on no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whatever to accept another obligation at your hands.

and fly from errors, which originated in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity on one ſide, and weakneſs on the other. I have wrote to my ſiſter, that I ſhall leave Woodbine Cot to-morrow, and nothing ſhall prevent my putting my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in execution." During the time Mrs. Talbot was ſpeaking, my father ſtood like one petrefied; my mother's colour went and came alternately red and pale. Indeed I was afraid ſhe would have fainted. At length ſhe aſſumed ſufficient courage to aſk with tolerable compoſure, how long ſhe had formed this reſolution, which appeared as ſudden as it was unexpected. "Oh! my dear madam," ſaid ſhe, "it is not a ſudden reſolution, I have long had it in my mind, but always wanted fortitude to execute my reſolves; it is much eaſier to ruſh into guilt, than to recede from it, and I have long learnt to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This dear young lady has compleated a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which your gentleneſs and virtue had begun. Believe me, madam, had I ſooner known, how very amiable you were, I ſhould never have injured you; but I was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to your goodneſs till it was too late to recall my error. When Miſs Howard re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from France, it was impoſſible to be an inmate in the houſe with her and not love her. From loving virtue in others we
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:029439_0042_0FE29F020F30F250"/>
by degrees wiſh to poſſeſs it ourſelves; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are conſcious that without it we cannot be reſpected or eſteemed by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy part of mankind. I wiſhed to obtain Miſs Howard's friendſhip; but I knew I was unworthy of the bleſſing. From that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I determined, if I could not merit her eſteem, I would at leaſt avoid her diſpleaſure and contempt; but alas!" continued ſhe; "I am too late; ſhe already deſpiſes me; and I feel I have not even a claim to her pity."</p>
                     <p>"For heaven's ſake! what does all this mean," ſaid my father, "who dares treat you with contempt, or inſult you with their pity?"</p>
                     <p>"No one, Mr. Howard," ſhe replied calmly; "I only ſay it is what I have a right to expect; if you remember I told you a few days ſince that I was determined no longer to lead a life of infamy; you thought me then in jeſt; perhaps you may think ſo ſtill; believe me, 'tis of little conſequence to me, what opinion you may form of my conduct; I am anxious only to obtain the pardon of theſe ladies, of whoſe merits I could wiſh you to be ſenſible, before you have inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſtroyed both their happineſs and your own." She then roſe from her ſeat, and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:029439_0043_0FE2A055E52D6CF0"/>
taking one of my mother's hands, and one of mine, preſſed them alternately to her lips, and burſting into a freſh flood of tears, left the room. My father followed her, and I heard them ſpeak very high in the adjoining apartment, but could diſtinguiſh nothing that paſt excepting the words, "never whilſt I have life," which were pronounced by Mrs. Talbot, as ſhe went up ſtairs, where ſhe locked herſelf into her own room. My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther went immediately out, nor was he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned while I ſat up with my mother, who ſeemed more melancholy than ever, and not inclined for converſation. This morning when we met at breakfaſt a heavy cloud hung on my father's brow. Mrs. Talbot was not come down. I went up to call her. The door was open. I went into the room; but found, by a letter which lay on the table, that ſhe had left the houſe at four o'clock in the morning. The cloaths and other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, which ſhe had received from my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were packed up in a ſmall trunk and directed for me. In her letter to my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhe takes a long adieu, and ſays there is not the leaſt probability of our ever meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again, as ſhe ſhould leave England almoſt immediately. It is impoſſible to deſcribe the rage of my father, when he found ſhe was really gone. He ſwore we had treated her ill, or ſhe never would have taken ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:029439_0044_0FE2A0579634C0E0"/>
In vain we proteſted our innocence. He vented his rage in the moſt ungentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-like terms, on my dear patient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who could return nothing but tears. He is now taking his uſual walk. I hope, when he returns, he will be calmer. I am weary, my dear Celia, and can write no more. Farewell. May good angels guard you.</p>

                     <p>I FOUND myſelf at the concluſion of my laſt letter, my dear ſiſter, totally unable to continue the ſubject, which I juſt hinted to you. I wiſhed you to conceive the whole without deſcending to particulars, yet how it that poſſible. At this moment you think me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

virtuous, but unfortunate woman; you alſo think Mr. Howard the moſt benevolent, moſt diſinterſted of men: ah! my dear ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, how have you been deceived. But to make you underſtand more perfectly, I muſt go back to the time when I loſt Mr. Talbot.</p>
                     <p>A ſtranger in London, alone unconnected with the world, deprived of the means of ſupport by my huſband's death. I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving in my mind what plan to purſue in future; when chance introduced me to Mr. Howard. My dreſs declared me a widow. He paid me innumerable little attentions, whenever we met at the houſe of an attorney, with whoſe lady I was intimate, and at length from having frequently called with my friend, who was employed to ſettle my late huſband's affairs, he aſſumed the privilege of viſiting by himſelf. To you, who know him ſo well, I need not deſcribe either the graces of his perſon, or his inſinuating ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. Perfect maſter of the art of deception: he conceals under the maſk of integrity and honour every vice which can diſgrace human nature: with that verſatality of temper which makes him appear every thing to every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; with the religious he is grave and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn; with the gay cheerful and affable, with the ſplenetic he can rail at the vices and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:029439_0046_0FE2A0615C3ACE80"/>
follies of mankind, and with the libertine practice thoſe vices himſelf: tho' where it is his intereſt he can appear devout, yet no man ever concieved a more contemptuous opinion of religion, or ſtrove with more diabolical earneſtneſs to corrupt the young and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced heart. When firſt I was introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, I was told he was a married man. What was my wonder, then, when after a few viſits he profeſſed a paſſion for me. I combated his ſophiſtical arguments as well as my weak reaſoning would permit; but alas! I loſt ground in every argument. At length he told me as a ſecret, which nothing but the moſt violent paſſion could have extorted from him, that he never did, nor ever could love his wife; that he had married her ſolely to oblige his father, who was ſince dead, and that ſhe was a cold, inanimate woman, fit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the frigid rules, and ſolemn rites of a convent. Then with the moſt ſolemn aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verations, he called heaven to witneſs that I was the only woman he ever loved; and called down the moſt heavy maledictions on his head, if he ſhould ever forſake me.</p>
                     <p>Lucetta, I was infatuated; I thought him the tendereſt, beſt of men, and mourn'd a fate which had united him to a woman he could not love. Poverty and diſtreſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded me. Mr. Howard offered a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:029439_0047_0FE2A063544D3078"/>
of fifty pounds a year and to take me into his family, as a relation of his own. My ſiſter, do you now concieve the depth of my ſhame. I accepted his offer, and a letter was diſpatched, to let Mrs. Howard know, he had met with a relation, whoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were rather embarraſſed and whom he had invited home, as he thought ſhe would prove an agreeable addition to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. The return of poſt brought ſuch an anſwer as might be expected from a woman, whoſe chief ſtudy was to pleaſe and render her huſband happy. When I arrived at Woodbine Cot, Mrs. Howard recieved me with a mixture of politeneſs and affection. Never ſhall I forget the ſenſations, which pervaded my boſom, when entering a neat parlour, ſhe roſe to welcome me. Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment riveted me to the ſpot; unable to ſpeak or move, I ſunk into the neareſt chair, and had nearly fainted. Figure to yourſelf, my ſiſter, a woman, ſcarcely thirty years old, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly formed, with a countenance animated and prepoſſeſſing; her fine blue eyes beam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tenderneſs on the cruel betrayer of her peace. Think you hear her in accents ſoft as the muſic of the ſpheres, by turns cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and comforting the very woman who had robbed her of her huſband's affections. And ſurely then, you will not wonder, if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſtifle my emotions, I gave way to a
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:029439_0048_0FE2A064D67F6258"/>
flood of tears. "You are too much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, my dear madam," ſaid Mrs. Howard, taking my hand. "Do not I beſeech you give way to immoderate grief: when miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes are irremidiable it is our duty to ſubmit without repining: but I flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the united attentions of my dear Mr. Howard, and myſelf, will by degrees reſtore your tranquility. In the mean time, I hope you will conſider yourſelf at home, and be aſſured, we ſhall think ourſelves happy in being able in the leaſt to contribute to your caſe or felicity." She then led me to an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, which had been prepared for me, and left me, to that repoſe which conſcious guilt rendered me incapable of enjoying.</p>
                     <p>The more I knew of this amiable woman, the greater cauſe I found for admiration and reſpect. She being naturally of an open diſpoſition, I was in the courſe of our inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, made acquainted with the moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial circumſtances of her life: and from her I learnt that ſhe had brought a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome fortune to Mr. Howard; and that they had married contrary to the advice of their friends on both ſides, as they had formed different views for them: but, ſaid ſhe, with a ſigh, "We thought love for each other would compenſate for the privation of the ſociety of our other friends."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="unknown:029439_0049_0FE2A06658B9A6A0"/>
I had not been long in this family, before I diſcovered, that I was not the only woman, who ſhared Mr. Howard's attention. He was neither careful to avoid ſuſpicion, nor deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in the choice of his companions, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every female ſervant in the family, who was not proof againſt flattering vows and preſents of finery, had at ſome time or other attracted her maſter's notice. The amiable ſuffering wife bore all with angelic patience, nor ever once breathed a murmur. I had the ſatisfaction to find that my remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances had ſome effect, and he became more circumſpect in his behaviour. I could alſo at any time reſtrain him from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of any new amour by threatning to leave him, and I flattered myſelf, that this in ſome meaſure attoned to Mrs. Howard for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries I did her. In this manner I continued in the family near three years, when I found an evident alteration in the conduct of my hoſteſs. Her manner was cold and diſtant; ſhe often avoided my ſociety and retired to her apartment, where I have ſurprized her weeping. Conſcious guilt would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to enquire the cauſe of her uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as I naturally imagined ſhe had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered my improper intimacy with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: but one day while we were at Briſtol, I overheard a converſation between them which determined me to quit a life, at once
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:029439_0050_0FE110E1FB019358"/>
ſo repugnant to honour, humanity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. It was one morning, as I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to enter the breakfaſt room, the door of which was not quite ſhut, when I heard Mr. Howard in a high key reproaching his wife for not behaving ſo kindly as formerly to me. I wiſhed to know in what manner Mrs. Howard ſpoke of me, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the meanneſs of liſtening. "My dear, Mr. Howard," ſaid ſhe, "how is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me to behave with cordiality to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who I am well convinced has uſurped my place in your affections; and tho' I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling acknowledge the many amiable traits in her character, I cannot be blind to that one error, which embitters every hour of my life; nor am I miſtreſs of ſufficient diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to wear the face of friendſhip where my heart feels only diſlike, nay almoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. I will not ſcruple to confeſs, I once did eſteem her: but pardon the expreſſion, if I ſay, the heart that loves virtue for its own ſake, can never form acquaintance with vice. We may pity, but we muſt deſpiſe."</p>
                     <p>"Hold madam," ſaid he, "or I ſhall be led to ſuppoſe you deſpiſe me."</p>
                     <p>"No, Mr. Howard," ſaid ſhe, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

the huſband of my affections, I have promiſed to love, to honour, and obey you, and heaven is my witneſs, I never have failed in one of thoſe points: to ceaſe to love you is impoſſible; to obey you is the pleaſure of my life: but, pardon me, if your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct has forced me unwillingly to own, I can no longer honour you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Here ſhe wept, and Mr. Howard not being able to make a juſt defence, flew into a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſion, as was his uſual cuſtom, ſwore ſhe was a moſt unaccountable woman, and wondered at his own patience in bearing with her ſo long. This undeſerved reproach awakened her ſtifled paſſion, and ſhe anſwered with intrepidity.</p>
                     <p>"No, ſir, it is my patience is to be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, but do not irritate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

ſilence; perhaps, you think, becauſe I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared blind to your immoral conduct, I countenanced it. Let me undeceive you. Mrs. Talbot ſhould not ſo long have remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the ſame roof with me, had I not feared, that by depriving her of an aſylum, I ſhould injure her reputation and drive her into an inhuman world, where one falſe ſtep is never forgiven, and ſhe might have ſunk into the loweſt abyſs of vice and infamy. I flattered myſelf my gentleneſs might have reclaimed her. I knew, alas! too well, the inconſtancy of your nature, and had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that when forſaken by you, ſhe ſhould not want a friend to ſnatch her from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ruin."</p>
                     <p>I was ſo overcome by this generous decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that I was forced to catch hold of the balluſtrade of the ſtairs, to prevent fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. A ſudden ſickneſs came over me, and I could not diſtinctly hear the remainder of their converſation; but, thank heaven, I profited ſo much from what I had heard, that I reſolved no longer, by my preſence, to wound a heart ſo replete with benevolence toward me. I did not enter the par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="33" facs="unknown:029439_0053_0FE110F095E76C00"/>
could think on nothing that appeared in the leaſt probable of ſucceſs. That afternoon Miſs Howard arrived from France. Had my mind been ever ſo depraved it muſt have returned to virtue after an acquaintance with this dear girl; I therefore became more firm in my reſolves; and having formed an acquaintance with an elderly lady, of whoſe ſenſe and goodneſs of heart I had a very high opinion; I determined to diſcloſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular of my ſituation to her, and aſk her advice in what manner I ſhould proceed. She heard me with attention, and was friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough not to attempt to paliate my er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. She placed my conduct in a proper light and encouraged the remorſe which was already awakened in my boſom. She then opened a ſcene of comfort to my diſtreſſed imagination, and having adviſed me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with the family to Woodbine Cot, to prevent any ill natured remarks among our acquaintance, and afterwards to purſue the plan which ſhe had laid down. Yet, will you believe it, when I returned to this place I felt my reſolution ſlacken, and found I was relapſing into my former errors; but this morning the dear amiable Meriel has awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened my ſleeping conſcience, and I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to leave the family immediately. I went into the garden after breakfaſt and found her weeping in a little arbour. "In
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:029439_0054_0FE110F472C67578"/>
tears, my dear little girl," ſaid I. "Have I not cauſe for tears," ſhe replied, "is not my beloved mother unhappy?"</p>
                     <p>"Unhappy!" ſaid I, with an accent of ſurpriſe, willing to try if ſhe was acquainted with the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>She fixed her expreſſive eyes on my face, and replied emphatically; "ſurely I need not tell you, Mrs. Talbot, that ſhe is very unhappy; for you profeſs yourſelf her friend, and friendſhip is quick ſighted in diſcerning the ſorrows of the perſon eſteemed: true friendſhip is alſo eagerly anxious to remove the cauſe of grief from the boſom of thoſe they love, though by ſo doing, they plant a thorn in their own."</p>
                     <p>I could not anſwer her; I did not even attempt it; but preſſing her hand in ſilence retired to another part of the garden.</p>
                     <p>On Tueſday morning, at four o'clock, I ſhall expect you will ſend a man and horſe for me. I ſhall come but poorly provided with caſh, as I am reſolved to leave my ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement behind me, as likewiſe every preſent of value, which I have received.

                     <p>MY father is more compoſed, than I could imagine poſſible in the abſence of Mrs. Talbot; but he is ſtill gloomy and unſocial with my mother; however, I cannot but flatter myſelf that time, and her unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſſiduities, will regain his affections; and was that to be the happy reſult of her pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and forbearance, how great would be our felicity.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Dolly Pringle has juſt called to ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit my mother's leave for my drinking tea with her. It is but ſeldom I am permitted to go without the boundaries of our garden, except to accompany my father or mother in a retired walk; but for a wonder, I am this afternoon to be truſted unaccompanied by either. I cannot think what my father is afraid of, that he ſhould be ſo averſe in

my taking any kind of innocent recreation. I am ſure, if I know my own heart, I have no improper wiſhes lurking there; yet he is always ſaying ſuch ſtrange things about love and lovers that it ſeems he would be angry if a man was only to ſpeak civil to me. Dolly knew this odd way of his, and ſo did not tell him that her brother was expected to come from London for a few days, and moſt likely would arrive this afternoon.

                     <p>"Bleſs me!" ſaid I, "I declare I never read ſuch a thing in my life."</p>
                     <p>"Surely then," ſhe replied with a look of ſurpriſe; "you never read the divine hiſtory of lady Frances and lady Caroline, or the loves of Edward and Harriet?" "No, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed," ſaid I, "I have never even heard of them."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! my dear girl, then," cried ſhe, in a ſort of extaſy; "you have a pleaſure to come, of which at preſent you can form no idea: I will lend you the books; but you muſt not let your father ſee them."</p>
                     <p>And that you may believe me Celia, I ſhall not; for he is always ready enough to abridge me of any thing that can afford me pleaſure.

                     <p>Well, to be ſure I do begin to be a little better pleaſed with the ſociety of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours than I was at firſt; indeed I feel my heart much lighter ſince Mrs. Talbot left us, for I ſee my dear mother looks happier; and if ſhe is happy I ſhall be ſo too. I ſpent a very agreeable evening at Mrs. Pringle's, whoſe ſon arrived, juſt as we had ſat down to tea; I thought him a very pleaſing young man. He is an enſign in the army, and has a military, manly countenance. I know not how it was, but whether from what Dolly had ſaid in the morning, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from my not being accuſtomed to the ſociety of men; yet I felt myſelf awkward and embarreſſed; however, as Mr. Pringle
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:029439_0060_0FE1111142BD89C0"/>
did not ſay any thing particular, I ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered myſelf, tho' when Mrs. Pringle and her daughter left the room for a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I was frightened to death leſt he ſhould make love to me, and you know, if he had I ſhould not have known what to ſay to him. This fear, I am ſure, made me look like a fool; for I felt my face glow like ſcarlet. I dare ſay he thought me an idiot; well, it is of little conſequence to me what he thought: only you know one don't like ſtrangers to form an unjuſt opinion of our mental faculties.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Pringle lent me the books which ſhe promiſed: I did not dare to read any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I went to bed, as my father often walks round the houſe to ſee if all the lights are out; and if he had caught me reading, he would have immediately taken the books from me, for he has lately taken it into his head that I read too much, and that I ſhall be good for nothing, if I am ſuffered to pore ſo much over a parcel of muſty old au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. So, I locked up my new acquiſitions in my cloſet, and aroſe two hours earlier this morning to peruſe it. Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Well, Celia, would you believe it, after having cried myſelf almoſt blind about the the diſtreſſes of the dear ladies, whoſe hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I have been reading, I was agreeably ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to find, in the end, all parties were made happy. I declare I was very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, and cannot ſay but I ſhould like to go into more company, and ſee a little more of life; for then perhaps I ſhould meet with ſome ſuch charming women as lady Frances and lady Caroline. Celia, I might alſo be admired by ſome fine gentleman, as they were; for I find country girls are as much engaged with love and lovers as the great ladies. I wiſh I could convey theſe books to you; or that you could get ſome juſt like them. Perhaps theſe were the kind my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

meant, when he talked about romances and novels; but yet that cannot be, as this is a real hiſtory, the characters drawn from life. Miſs Pringle has promiſed to lend me ſome more of the ſame ſort, and ſome plays; ſo I think I ſhall paſs my time much more agreeably than before; tho' do not think I mean to neglect thoſe authors our dear ſiſter Conſtance ſo ſtrenuouſly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to my notice. No, no, my friend, I will not neglect the uſeful ſtudies of hiſtory, geography, and far more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary duty of public and private devotion; and now I am on the ſubject of devotion, I muſt juſt mention ſomething in my father's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which is to me unaccountable. Tho' he talked to me in the profane ſtile I have related in a former letter, yet to my mother and the families who viſit us, he pretends to have a high veneration for religion and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſubjects, and as we live a conſiderable diſtance from the church, he makes a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of reading the morning ſervice to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; tho' perhaps the moment he has cloſed the prayer book, ſhould the moſt trifling thing happen to ruffle his temper, he will burſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fits of ungovernable rage, and ſwear in ſuch a horrible manner, that I ſhudder to hear him. There is a little boy, whom he has taken into the family, and whom he takes great pains to teach his catechiſm, &amp;c.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:029439_0063_0FE1112057F16500"/>
I have ſeen him whip the poor lad unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for innocently humming a ſong tune on a Sunday morning, when he himſelf lives in the conſtant breach of almoſt every duty the chriſtian religion lays days down for our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and direction. Are not theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtencies, Celia? Surely the father of children, the maſter of a family, ſhould ſet a good example, or he can never expect others to attend to duties he ſo evidently appears to diſregard.</p>
                     <p>My dear old nurſe, Deborah, arrived yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, from a viſit ſhe has been paying her friends ever ſince our return from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. She enquired when I had heard from you; deſires you will not forget her. Of this I aſſured her, ſhe need not be afraid. Her return is another ſource of comfort to me, as my mother ſays ſhe ſhall continue in the family as long as ſhe pleaſes, and you know the affection I have contracted for her, from her attendance on me the whole time I was abroad, indeed I conſider her almoſt in a maternal light, her fidelity and attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our family has been ever unſhaken.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Pringle called this afternoon, and we walked in the garden together near an hour, during which time ſhe told me her brother was greatly ſtruck with my perſon,

and that he had told his mother, if he thought I would return his paſſion, he ſhould immediately relinquiſh the idea he had formed of marrying a woman, to whom the whole family had the greateſt diſlike, as ſhe was ignorant, low born and without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.

                     <p>"Bleſs me," ſaid I, "how can you talk ſo, you know I muſt not think of liſtening to a lover without my father's permiſſion."</p>
                     <p>"Your father indeed," cried ſhe laughing, "I wonder what your dear little ſimple head will fancy next: why child, he would forbid me the houſe if he only ſuſpected ſuch a thing; and you know my dear Meriel," (ſhe continned in a ſoft ſoothing accent) "you know, we are boſom friends and ſworn ſiſters and it would be very hard, you know, to be ſeparated, perhaps forever."</p>
                     <p>"Indeed Miſs Pringle," ſaid I, "my heart feels grateful for the friendſhip you profeſs for me, and I ſhould be very ſorry to be deprived of your ſociety."</p>
                     <p>"Well, then my dear," ſaid ſhe, "take this letter and don't let either your father or your mother ſee it." I would have refuſed
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:029439_0065_0FE1112A6F3EE8E0"/>
the letter, as I feared it would be improper to take it; but my father juſt then entering the garden, I dreaded his anger which is awakened at the moſt inſignificant trifles, and is always impetuous: ſo I haſtily put it in my pocket.</p>
                     <p>When we returned to the houſe and Miſs Pringle was gone, he cried pettiſhly to my another; "what does that girl do ſo often here? I ſhall have Meriel ſpoiled by her nonſenſical chatter; beſides I will lay a gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea there is an intrigue of ſome ſort contriving between them; I never knew two girls al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be ſo much together but they hatched miſchief." "If you do not like Dolly Pringle," replied my mother, "we will try to drop her acquaintance, but you muſt conſider, Mr. Howard, Meriel muſt have ſome ſociety." "Why, pray what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety would ſhe have," ſaid he, "are not you always with her, and has ſhe not plenty of needle work to do? let her ſtick cloſe to that, and ſhe won't want to be gadding and goſſiping: ſhe is at preſent a ſtranger to the world, and the leſs ſhe knows of it the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter." This unkindneſs does not grieve me as it would if I loved him; but it gives me pain to ſee how much it affects my mother. I ſat down to ſupper in ſilence, and when it was finiſhed, retired as uſual to my own

room, where I haiſtily broke the ſeal of my letter, and found it wrote in ſuch a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtyle, ſo tender, ſo lively, I read it over half a dozen times, but could not determine whether to anſwer it or not. Good night Celia, it is eleven o'clock, and I dare not write a moment longer.</p>

have left my bed at the early hour of four, to pour forth my complaints to my dear Celia. In my laſt I told you I had reciev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a letter from Mr. Pringle, declaring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf my lover: I will own I was very much pleaſed with it. Tho' at firſt I heſitated to anſwer it, yet, when I read a few more books, which Miſs Dolly Pringle ſent me by means of our dairy maid, and I found that none of the young ladies mentioned in them ever heſitated at anſwering their lover's letters; I ventured to write a few lines in reply to one which he ſent me requeſting me to meet him one night after the family were in bed, and in which he told me, Lettice the maid would come and let me know, when all was quiet in the houſe, and that ſhe would go with me to the place he had appointed for our meeting. Indeed, Celia, I did not think any harm; ſo I wrote and told him if his ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would come with him, I would meet him, for I wiſhed very much to ſee Dolly, and I knew I ſhould not have another opportunity very ſoon.</p>
                     <p>When we met, his manner was ſo tender, his language ſo pathetic, and the tender at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of his ſiſter ſo like what I had read, that I could not help confeſſing that I pitied him, and that if it would in the leaſt alleviate his ſuffering, I would meet him there again.
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:029439_0068_0FE11135EE6067F0"/>
We went on thus for ſome time, when over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered one evening by his entreaties, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to go with him to London, where he promiſed to marry me. Dear, dear, Celia, I tremble even now, when I think of what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. The next day we had juſt done break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, when an elderly gentleman who has a great regard for my father and mother called, and telling the latter he had ſomething very particular to ſay to her, they walked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into the garden. When they returned, I ſaw my dear mother, oh! I ſhall never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it, I ſaw her look extremely angry, her eyes darted at me ſuch indignant glances, that my very ſoul felt humbled within me, I could have fallen at her feet and intreated to know the cauſe of her anger: for indeed, Celia, I did not think, if ſhe had even diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered my correſpondence with young Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, that ſhe would have been ſo very much offended, eſpecially as I could appeal for a precedent, to the conduct of ſo many amiable young ladies of even rank and fortune. But the moment Mr. Sutten was gone, ſhe aſked me in a tone that rent my very heart, how I dared either to receive or write letters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her knowledge. Her anger overpowered me; ſomething roſe in my throat and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented my ſpeaking, I thought I ſhould have died with ſorrow, when ſhe thus continued, "Unkind, ungenerous Meriel, thus to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the confidence your mother had placed in you. How, degenerate girl, have you dared to violate the laws of female delicacy, by openly avowing a paſſion for a man to whom you are almoſt a ſtranger, and even to make yourſelf ridiculous by writing ſuch letters to him as renders you the jeſt of the whole village." "Oh! my dear mother," ſaid I in a voice almoſt choaked with ſobs; "indeed I did not think any harm." "Perhaps, Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el," ſaid ſhe, "had you ſtopped here, I might have forgiven you: but know, falſe diſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling girl, I have diſcovered all your illicit plans, you have left your father's houſe at hours, when modeſty would have ſhrunk to venture out, without a proper protector: and, to compleat your imprudence, this very night you had deſigned to quit a mother, whom you have pretended to love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and to throw yourſelf intirely into the power of a wretch, who regards you only as a vehicle, thro' which he may come at the poſſeſſion of your fortune."</p>
                     <p>I fell at her feet and would have taken her hand; but ſhe ſnatched it from me, and and riſing from her ſeat left me weeping on the ground.</p>
                     <p>"Unworthy girl," ſaid ſhe, as ſhe left the room, "go hide yourſelf from my ſight, for
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:029439_0070_0FE1113E9E6AE168"/>
you are become odious to me. Never, never, child, can you regain the confidence you have loſt. I had flattered myſelf with find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in you a comforter and tender filial friend; but you have added another wound to a heart already lacerated by many ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows."</p>
                     <p>When my mother was gone, I laid my head upon a chair and continued weeping. In this poſition my father found me. "So, Miſs," ſaid he, ſternly, "I find you were for providing a huſband for yourſelf; you were reſolved to loſe no time; but pray what will you ſay when I tell you this fine lover of your's is already married and has been ſo theſe two years."</p>
                     <p>"Married, ſir" cried I, raiſing my head.</p>
                     <p>"Yes child, married, though his friends were unacquainted with it, but this morning I hear his wife is arrived from London, with one child, to ſolicit that ſupport which he has inhumanly refuſed her." I made no anſwer, but returning my head to its reclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſture, continued weeping without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion. "Ah! my poor little Meriel," ſaid he, in a tone of voice more ſoft than uſual, "I am afraid this naughty man has made great havock with your heart; but,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:029439_0071_0FE111444171A100"/>
come, come, you ſhall not wear the willow long, we will find another lover for you ſoon."</p>
                     <p>"Indeed, ſir, you miſtake the cauſe of my tears," ſaid I. "It is not the loſs of all the lovers in the world would grieve me half ſo much as the fear of having forever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited my dear mother's affection."</p>
                     <p>"Well, well," he replied, "don't let that vex you; if ſhe is unkind, I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to attone for it. To be ſure, ſhe is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rigid in her notions, but I dare ſay, when ſhe ſees you heartily repent your fault, ſhe will overlook it and love you as well as ever."</p>
                     <p>He then left me, and I retired to my apartment, where Deborah told me my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had been, and had carried all my pens, ink and paper away with her. Ever ſince ſhe has been cold, diſtant, nay almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Oh! my dear friend, what ſhall I do to regain her affection, and convince her my repentance is ſincere. Indeed, ſhe is to me the deareſt object upon earth, and her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs ſhall henceforth be my only ſtudy.</p>
                     <p>My father, when my mother is preſent, treats me with equal rigour; but, when we
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:029439_0072_0FE11146A9C33538"/>
are alone, he is more gentle. Once or twice he has come to my apartment when ſhe was out, and even brought me ſome books; among which were ſome French novels. Even my brother has heard of my impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and has wrote to my mother, enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of the report; but he does not write as if he wiſhed it falſe. I do not think he loves me; he had expected a legacy from Mrs. Mirvan, but the whole of her fortune being left to me, has created envy and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy in a boſom, which I had once flattered myſelf I ſhould find warm with friendly and fraternal love: and yet, Celia, if he did but know my heart, he would ſee he had no cauſe to envy me, except he ſhould envy thoſe delightful ſenſations which I ſhall feel when I come to the poſſeſſion of my fortune, in ſaying, brother, it is equally your's, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it to its utmoſt extent.</p>
                     <p>Deborah has promiſed me to get this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conveyed to the neareſt poſt town. When you write, direct under cover to Mrs. Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah Ellis, to remain at the office till called for, I dare not let my mother know I correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond with any one, leaſt ſhe ſhould diſcover by what means I got the materials for writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and poor Deborah would ſuffer for her affectionate indulgence.

                        <salute>DEAR MISS,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I HOPE, you will pardon this freedom in a poor old woman, who is almoſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hearted, at an accident which has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the whole family. I hardly know how to tell you, becauſe I know you loved and valued my dear young lady; and ſo indeed muſt every one who knew her merits, tho' ſince ſhe has returned from France, I have heard her ridiculed for virtues which
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:029439_0074_0FE1114EE53AF1E0"/>
few, if any, endeavoured to imitate; and have ſeen her drawn into errors, by thoſe who, envying the ſuperior qualities of her heart, endeavoured to bring her more on a level with themſelves. She ſhewed me the laſt letter ſhe wrote to you; for it was only on condition of ſeeing all ſhe wrote, that I ſupplied her with the means of following her favourite amuſement. The ſternneſs of her mother ſtill continued; and the poor young lady was abridged of the pleaſure of even walking beyond the limits of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's garden. Mr. Howard's conduct, towards the dear girl, was altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable, ſometimes harſh, unfeelingly reproaching her for her intended error; a method, in my poor humble opinion, by no means calculated to lead her to renounce the attachment, which hurried her to ſo impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per a ſtep. At other times, he turned the whole affair into ridicule, and converſed with his daughter in a gay familiar manner; but tho' ſhe trembled at his anger, ſhe never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed any ſatisfaction in his company when good humoured; but rather wiſhed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge in ſolitude and ſtudy. About ten days ſince my miſtreſs was ſent for, into Eſſex, to a relation, who was extremely ill. Mr. Howard did not accompany her: ſhe ſet off in the afternoon, and he having procured a chaiſe took Miſs Meriel out for a ride, an
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:029439_0075_0FE1115480D6A920"/>
indulgence ſhe had never experienced ſince her reſidence at this place. When ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſhe ſeemed very melancholy, and ſaid her ſpirits were much oppreſſed, and her mind harraſſed with terrors, for which ſhe could by no means account. She ſupped with her father and retired at her uſual hour. Mr. Howard ſat up much later than common, and to my great ſurpriſe, when I carried in his candle, he ſeemed intoxicated, tho' he had been alone and ſeldom gave way to exceſſive drinking, unleſs he had been led into it by company. I heard him go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his apartment, and then went to bed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, where the fatigue of the day ſoon made me fall aſleep. About two o'clock I was awakened by Miſs Howard, who in a ſhiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice aſked me if I had not heard a noiſe in her chamber, ſaid, ſhe was greatly frightened, and would, if I pleaſed, ſtay the remainder of the night with me. I helped her into bed; ſhe was cold as death, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled exceſſivly, and ſoonfell into a convulſive hyſteric fit. Greatly alarmed, I called up one of my fellow ſervants, and by repeated applications of hartſhorn, vinegar, &amp;c. brought her to herſelf; ſhe would give no account of the cauſe of her fright; but ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to mourn ſome heavy misfortune, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly wiſhed herſelf with you in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent again. She reſted but little all night,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:029439_0076_0FE1115801BFC4E8"/>
and the next morning was ſo indiſpoſed as to be unable to riſe, and was confined to her room for ſeveral ſucceeding days. One day after ſhe had ventured down ſtairs; I aſked leave to go a few miles, on ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular buſineſs, where I was detained all night, by reaſon of a violent ſtorm. Riſing early in the morning, and walking home be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any of the family but the houſe maids was ſtirring, I went up immediately to ſee how my dear Miſs Meriel was, for I had been very uneaſy about her all night, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe was terrified at thunder, and would not dare to expreſs her fears to her father, who would only have ridiculed them. On entering the room I was alarmed to find the bed in great diſorder; many of her cloaths laying about the floor, the window open, and my beloved Miſs Howard gone. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ſheets faſtened to the bed-poſt, I naturally imagined ſhe muſt have ſlid by them into the garden, and looking out at the window I ſaw one of her ſhoes lay on the ground. Convinced now, of what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had only conjectured, I gave a ſcream of terror which alarmed my maſter, who came half dreſſed, pale and trembling into the room, exclaiming, "for God's ſake what is the noiſe about." "My young lady, ſir," ſaid I, pointing to the window. "Elop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed," ſaid he, "with that villain, Pringle; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

here I ſware never again to ſuffer"—"Oh, ſir!" cried I eagerly, "do not ſware to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce her; I'd venture my life upon her innocence; I am ſure ſome vile means have been uſed to draw her thus from her duty."</p>
                     <p>"She is a little hypocrite, nurſe," ſaid he, "and will make herſelf friends wherever ſhe goes, till ſhe is found out. I ſuppoſe ſhe will trump up ſome fine ſtory about ill uſage, or ſome deviliſh thing or other. I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> to my ſoul ſhe had never left the convent; this will go near to break her mother's heart."</p>
                     <p>About noon Mrs. Howard returned. It is impoſſible to deſcribe her anguiſh when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of her daughter's abſence (I will not ſay elopement) becauſe I am ſure, if the truth was known, it would not deſerve ſo harſh an appellation. She ſent immediately to Mrs. Pringle's, where ſhe heard that the young gentleman went away, as he ſaid, to join his regiment the afternoon before. Thus does this unlucky circumſtance tend to make it univerſally believed, that Miſs Howard and Mr. Pringle are together; but, indeed Miſs, I do not think that is the caſe; for, certain I am, that a purer heart never inhabited a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man boſom, and that ſhe never would have thought of eloping with a married man: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I am convinced ſhe was not greatly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to him. He was the firſt man who had
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:029439_0078_0FE111611A553DD0"/>
ever addreſſed her; ſhe is the pure child of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſguiſed nature, and being pleaſed with his attentions which had the charm of novelty to recommend them; ſhe fancied herſelf in love; but after her conduct had been placed in a proper light, by her mother, ſhe ſeemed perfectly convinced of her error, and often uſed to ſay, ſhe wondered how ſhe could imagine ſhe loved a man, of whom ſhe knew ſo little. "I ſhould think, nurſe," ſaid ſhe one day, "that this unfortunate affair in the end would be greatly beneficial to me, as it will make me, in future, diſtruſt the emotions of my heart, and be upon my guard againſt its deceptions; but I fear it has irreparably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured me in the opinion of my mother; but I muſt endeavour, by my future conduct, to regain her confidence, and in the mean time, ſubmit with patience to that diſpleaſure I am certain I have in a great meaſure deſerved." Such ſentiments as theſe, madam, do not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue a depravity of heart. Oh! no, my ſweet Meriel is at this moment as free from guilt as an angel. Three days are now elapſed ſince her departure, during which time no tidings can be gained concerning her. Oh! Miſs, I fear we ſhall never ſee the dear creature again: ſome dreadful myſtery is certainly concealed by her thus abruptly leaving her father's houſe. Would to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven I had the means of clearing it up, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>I juſt ſnatch up my pen to inform you, dear Miſs, that Miſs Howard is found, and is at preſent in her father's houſe; but in ſuch a ſituation that we have little hope of her ever recovering her ſenſes ſufficient to give any regular account of the cauſe of her flight, of this we are certain, ſhe was not with Mr. Pringle.</p>

                     <p>I am now ſitting by my poor young lady's bed ſide, who is juſt fallen into a ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing ſleep, and ſhall ſeize this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to inform you, in what manner ſhe was diſcovered and conducted home. A farmer who lives about five miles from hence, at the ſkirt of a wood, having occaſion for his horſe to be brought from paſture early in the morning, ordered a lad who lived as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant with him, to go by four o'clock and fetch it: the lad's way lay thro' the wood, and when he returned he declared he had been
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:029439_0080_0FE1116BB880F358"/>
frightened almoſt to death by an apparition of a woman, dreſſed all in white, whom he ſaw ſitting at the foot of a tree as he went; that he heard her ſigh and groan, and ſaid he ſuppoſed it was the ſpirit of Fanny Summers, who hung herſelf there laſt autumn, and he was the more poſitive of this, as at his return, he ſaw her walking too and fro with a child in her arms and heard her talk to it. The farmer laughed at the lad's tale, and rode away without paying any farther attention to it, but a young gentleman who has a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at the farmers, on account of an ill ſtate of health, having over heard the boy's ſtory, determined to riſe immediately and go to the wood to inveſtigate the matter farther, as he ſuppoſed it might be ſome unfortunate human creature, rather than a ſupernatural being; and determined, if in his power, to reſcue her from miſery, and, what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more than probable, a horrid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely end. He had not penetrated far into the wood before he diſcovered, at the foot of an old oak, a female form ſtretched on the ground, and by her ſide a little ſpaniel, whoſe head lay on the woman's arm, and who at frequent intervals ſeemed to make moſt pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious moans. He approached and found the unfortunate female was in a fit, he gently raiſed her from the ground, ſupporting her in his arms whilſt he chaffed her temples with
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:029439_0081_0FE1117163BAFCE8"/>
volatiles, which, on account of his own weak conſtitution, he always carried in his pocket. While he was thus employed, the dog fawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him licked his hand and ſhewed every token of gratitude in his power; at length the lady began to move, and her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver hearing the voices of labourers paſſing through the wood, hallowed to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. When they came near, the dog flew from his miſtreſs to one of them, leaping, bounding and howling for joy. What Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, ſaid the clown, how come you here, then drawing nearer to help ſupport the lady; he ſtarted back and cried, body o'me, 'tis Miſs Meriel, poor dear ſoul, how could ſhe get here, as ſure as any thing ſhe has been robbed and murdered. Almoſt ſmiling at the fellow's ſtupidity, the young gentleman bid him ceaſe his wonder and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in bearing her to the farm which was the neareſt houſe. The dear creaure never ſpoke during the whole time, indeed ſhe ſeemed totally incapable of uttering a word, when they got her to the houſe ſhe drank a few ſpoonfulls of milk, which ſomewhat revived her, but her voice was ſtill ſo weak they were unable to diſtinguiſh what ſhe ſaid, and her eyes too plainly indicated that her mind was diſturbed, the good woman of the houſe had her put immediately to bed, and Iſaac the labourer came home to let his maſter and
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:029439_0082_0FE11175A9989AF8"/>
miſtreſs know were their daughter was. When he told the melancholy tale, Mrs. Howard claſped her hands and cried, my child deprived of her ſenſes! ſhe had not time for more, for Mr. Howard had fallen on the floor in a fit. I cannot account for this violent emotion in a man, who had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhewn any great degree of tenderneſs towards his child, but I think I never ſaw the fondeſt parent more affected.</p>
                     <p>When the family became tolerably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, it was propoſed that I ſhould take a chaiſe and proceed to the farm, when if Miſs Howard was able to bear the motion of the carriage, I was to conduct her home; if not, to remain with her; and her mother would come to her in the morning. When I arrived at the farm, and was ſhewn into the room where my dear young lady was; my agitation was ſo great I thought I ſhould have died; ſhe had on being firſt put to bed fallen into a little doze, but ſoon ſtarted and awoke in great terror, and finding herſelf undreſſed, ſcreamed out, "oh heavens! I am betrayed, I am loſt, he is here; I know he is here, and I will not ſtay another mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment." She then inſiſted on being dreſſed. The neighbouring apothecary had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly ſent for; he felt her pulſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that the diſorder lay entirely on her
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:029439_0083_0FE1117B04187640"/>
ſpirits; that every nerve ſeemed convulſed, and ſhe alſo appeared to be greatly weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for want of proper ſuſtenance. She was prevailed on to eat a bit of bread, and drink a little weak wine and water; after which ſhe became a little more compoſed, and had ſunk into a profound ſleep on the ſide of the bed. In this ſituation I found her; the faithful Lubin laying on a chair that ſtood by the bed ſide, his head ſtretched out to the pillow of his miſtreſs, whom he had not quitted for a moment ſince her entrance into the houſe. This dog had been miſſing ever ſince Miſs Howard's abſence, but our minds had been occupied by thoughts of ſo much more diſtreſſing a nature that Lubin was hardly remembered; he was greatly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to her from her firſt return, and ſhe remarkably fond of him. I ſat down ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the ſide of the bed, and looked at her dear countenance which ſo lately wore the bloom of youth and the ſmile of innocent chearfulneſs: alas! how changed, deadly pale where her cheeks and lips, and only that I percieved ſhe breathed, I ſhould have thought ſhe was no longer an inhabitant of this world; my tears flowed plentifully. Her ſleep, tho' apparantly ſound, was not of long continuance; ſhe ſhrieked, awoke, and immediately ſtarted off the bed; I caught her hand, ſhe turned haſtily round. "Oh! it is
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:029439_0084_0FE1117DCB43A2F0"/>
you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> is it, well now we will go. If you will accompany me, ſay ſo at once, if not I muſt go without you; for I cannot ſtay here another moment. But where is he now," looking wildly round her, "Who are you talking of my dear," ſaid I, tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. "Ah! there is the thing now, I thought you would want to know his name, but I cannot tell you nurſe, ſo do not aſk me; I have made a vow, a ſolemn ſacred vow, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to wound the peace of my dear, adored, mother." "But my dear creature you have almoſt broken her heart by thus flying from her protection and your father." "Father," ſaid ſhe, "have I a father? Oh! that I had never been born." She then began to rave in a moſt incoherent manner, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ſhe would not ſtay another moment in the houſe. I took this opportunity with the permiſſion of the apothecary to convey her home: when the chaiſe ſtopped at the door ſhe looked out, and clapping her hand to her forehead, cried "yes I ſee how it is, well, well, it will not be long before I am releaſed, and till then, I muſt be patient." I aſſiſted her in alighting, ſhe leaned on my arm and walked ſlowly into the houſe; Mrs. Howard was ſo overcome ſhe was unable to riſe from her ſeat. Meriel looked for a moment at her attentively, then ſhaking her head in a moſt ſorrowful manner, ſhe
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:029439_0085_0FE11183E33EEB30"/>
cried, "oh! I ſee I have afflicted you, but, alas! my own heart is overwhelmed with ſorrow; and then when I think for a moment, there are ſome remembrances which muſt be ever buried in my heart, that torture me ſo, my brain ſeems on fire." Mrs. Howard attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpeak, but unequal to the taſk, ſhe claſped her hands in an agony, and ſobbed aloud: Meriel ſunk on her knees before her, took both her hands, put them firſt to her head and then to her heart; and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deep ſigh, fell lifeleſs on the floor. We had her immediately conveyed to bed, where ſhe ſoon recovered; but a violent fever come on, and ſhe continued raving all night. Mr. Howard has not yet ſeen her, he ſays if the girl's ſpirits are in ſuch perturbation, the ſight of him, whom ſhe muſt be conſcious ſhe has offended, would only irritate them more, when ſhe is better I will ſee her, ſaid he, and forgive her, that will calm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her.</p>
                     <p>A phyſician was ſent for; he ſaid quiet and tenderneſs from thoſe about her are the chief things requiſite to reſtore her. In the mean time, my dear madam, ſaid he, I will ſend her a compoſing draught; if when ſhe recovers the uſe of her reaſon, you can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with her to unburthen her mind, which, I am certain labours with ſome painful ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:029439_0086_0FE1118657508568"/>
it would greatly aſſiſt and haſten her recovery.</p>
                     <p>Thus far, my dear Miſs, have I given you an account of this myſterious affair. What to think of her ſudden departure, and being found in ſuch a ſhocking ſituation, we are all totally at a loſs. It appears ſhe has been terrified and extremely ill uſed by ſomebody; but even in the moſt violent paroxiſms of her delirium, ſhe has never mentioned his name. I have one thought that haunts me continually; but that is ſo horrible I dare not commit it to paper. Indeed, it is too dreadful, too ſhocking to human nature, to wear even the face of probability.</p>
                     <p>The medicines preſcribed have taken the deſired effect, and ſhe has been in a compoſed ſleep above three hours. I will not conclude till I can inform you how ſhe appears on awaking, as I know your affection for her will make you extremely anxious.</p>
                     <p>She awoke tolerably calm, inſtantly recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected where ſhe was, but did not ſeem to retain any idea of the late unhappy events. "It is late, nurſe," ſaid ſhe, addreſſing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to me "is it not time to get up," then pauſing a moment, "I have had ſuch a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid dream. Oh! I would not paſs ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:029439_0087_0FE1118C1006B8E0"/>
night:" ſhe then attempted to riſe; but finding herſelf extremely weak, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, "what is the matter; have I been ill?" "Yes, my love," ſaid I, "you have been very ill, and are far from well now." "Then perhaps it was not a dream," ſaid ſhe, putting her hand to her forehead, as if try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to recollect; ſhe was ſilent for a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then caught hold my hand, and burſting into tears, ſhe cried, "alas! it was all a reality."</p>
                     <p>I did not attempt to ſtop her tears, as I thought they would relieve her. She aſked for her mother; ſeemed pleaſed to ſee her, but was too weak to talk much. The phyſician has juſt ſeen her, and declares her in a fair way to do well. I hope, Miſs, you will excuſe all errors in this long letter, as I thought you would be anxious to know all the particulars, I have dwelt on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject more than perhaps was neceſſary, but will now no longer intrude.</p>

                     <p>ONCE more, my beloved Celia, I am permitted to addreſs you; but I will not addreſs you in the voice of complaint, becauſe I might have been far more wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than I am.

To no other perſon breathing will I unfold my labouring heart: no, not even to kind hearted Deborah, or my my dear ſuffering mother: but to you, Celia, to you whoſe thoughts are detached from the world, to you who will conſider this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence as ſacred: to you I will venture to diſcloſe a ſcene, the remembrance of which, even at this moment, chills the vital tide that nouriſhes my heart. But you, my gentle friend, well I know, tho' ſtruck with horror at the tale I ſhall unfold, will join with me in offering to the throne of grace, fervent prayers for the author of my ſorrows. "Oh thou Father, creator of the univerſe, look down upon him, pardon his manifold of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, touch his heart that he may ſee his errors, and oh! of thy infinite mercy, blot this laſt tranſgreſſion from the book of life." This is my daily prayer—but to proceed in my ſad taſk:</p>
                     <p>The day my mother went into Eſſex I felt my ſpirits unuſually oppreſſed, I rode out in the afternoon with my father, he
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:029439_0090_0FE111990ABE9470"/>
was extremely gay in his converſation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I thought too much ſo, as he treated ſome ſubjects with a levity which greatly ſhocked me, and ſome expreſſions eſcaped him which wounded my delicacy, but this did not ſo much ſurpriſe me as he had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently indulged himſelf in very improper converſation, not only before me, but other young women, who viſited at the houſe, for which my mother always reproved him, but he in general turned it off with a laugh. However, as I had no perſon with me in the chaiſe, his manner was extremely embaraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, nay even diſtreſſing, for he ſaluted me ſeveral times, told me he was afraid of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much affection to me before my mother, who in her heart hates me; but, that if I was a good girl, he would not care for my mother, but ſhew me every kindneſs in his power; that I ſhould go where I pleaſed, and do whatever my inclinations led me to. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhed at this converſation, I hardly knew what to anſwer, and was extremely glad when we got home. I would have retired immediately to my appartment, but he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on my ſtaying to ſup with him, ſaying he had ordered a chicken on purpoſe for me. I reluctantly complied. During ſupper he drank very freely and would have had me drink ſeveral glaſſes of wine; which as I was unaccuſtomed to I reſolutely refuſed. When
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:029439_0091_0FE1119E8C2F2400"/>
I had ſupped he would have me play him a tune, after which he ſung a ſong more adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the taſte of a libertine than the chaſte ears of a daughter. At ten o'clock I retired, and, tho' greatly ſurprized at my father's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, yet having nothing particularly heavy on my mind, I ſoon fell aſleep, I never had been uſed to lock my door, and you may imagine my terror when being awoke by a noiſe in the room, I felt a man's hand take hold of mine; I gave a faint ſcream, fright deprived me of much power, but how were my fears increaſed, when I heard my father ſay, "huſh! don't make a noiſe, it is only me." "You, ſir," I replied, ſtarting up, "and what can be the cauſe of your coming here." I cannot remember his anſwer, Celia, but I know he caught me in his arms. I ſprang from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> with a violent effort, and quitting the bed, the darkneſs of the night befriended me and I ruſhed out of the room into Deborah's chamber. After this I kept my apartment for ſeveral days, nor did I intend to have left it again till my mother's return, pretending indiſpoſition; but he wrote me a letter, in which he aſſerted that he had miſtaken my chamber for the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid's, with whom he confeſſed he had an intrigue. Oh Celia! what a humaliating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion from a father to a child, ſure none but an unprincipled rake could have brought
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:029439_0092_0FE111A2C5CE30D8"/>
himſelf to make it. He begged I would not mention the circumſtance to my mother, and promiſed amendment in future. Alas! I was deceived by this letter and again ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured down to my meals. The day Deborah had leave to go out I ſpent the chief part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, he was remarkably reſerved in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and ſeemed even indifferent and inattentive to me, ſcarcely ſpeaking the whole day. At ſupper I drank as uſual one glaſs of wine and then retired; I felt an unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able drowſineſs come over me; but it had been a ſtorm all the evening, and the almoſt inceſſant flaſhes of lightning, with diſtant rumbling thunder, prevented my indulging it. I had partly undreſſed myſelf and was ſitting on the ſide of the bed endeavouring to compoſe myſelf, (for I am greatly terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at lightning,) when the door opened, and my father entered; he immediately ſhut the door and turned the key. To deſcribe my horror is impoſſible, or to give you the moſt diſtant idea of the ſcene that enſued; but never to the lateſt hour I have to breathe, will it be eraſed from my memory. My re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated ſcreams were of no avail. Deborah was from home, and the other maids ſlept too far off to hear me. Oh! how often did I wiſh that the vivid lightning, which every moment illumined the room, would ſtrike me dead. At length a moſt tremendous clap
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:029439_0093_0FE111A8EC711340"/>
of thunder burſt as it were directly over us. It ennerved, even the arm of hardened guilt, but it encouraged me. I ſeized the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to fling open the window and declare, if he did not inſtantly quit my chamber, I would throw myſelf out, and ſeeing a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife lay on the window ſeat, I ſnatched it up: "come not near me, ſir," ſaid I, "for the moment you lay your hand upon me, this ſhall put an end to your exiſtence." my fury which had wrought me almoſt to a ſtate of frenzy, intimidated him. "Be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, Meriel," ſaid he, "ſhut the window and get into bed, you will catch your death with cold." "Better be dead," ſaid I, "than live with diſhonour." "I ſwear," he replied, "by all that is ſacred, if you will go quietly to bed I will quit the room immediately."</p>
                     <p>"You ſhall quit it inſtantly," ſaid I, in a menacing accent; "am I not your child, and do you dare invade the virtue it is your duty to protect?" Celia, I felt at that moment as tho' I could have encountered almoſt any thing; that I could have bared my boſom to the ſtroke of death, and even met the blow with thankfulneſs; he ſaw my increaſing frenzy, and trembling unlocked the door and left the room. The moment he was gone I locked myſelf in, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with horror and diſtreſs, fell almoſt life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

on the bed: how long I continued in this ſtate of torpor I cannot tell; but the firſt uſe I made of my returning ſenſes was to think of eſcaping from the houſe, and in this I was reſolutely determined, when I heard him again at the door demanding ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: the candle was now gone out, and the window ſtill open; the thought was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary: I formed no plan for ſupport, nor even thought of a place where to ſeek an aſylum; but, ſtarting up, I pulled the ſheets off the bed, and, undreſſed as I was, ſlipped by them into the garden. How I eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped, unhurt, heaven alone can tell: the moment I felt myſelf on the ground I thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God for my deliverance, and going out of the back garden gate, ran as faſt as my ſtrength would permit, as I imagined, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a neighbouring villages but as the day began to dawn, I found I had taken a wrong road, and was at the entrance of a large wood; I was afraid to return, leſt I ſhould meet my father; therefore, forcing my way into the thickeſt part, I found a little hovel, which had been made by ſome unfortunate wanderer, of branches and dry leaves: into this poor ſhelter I crept, and here firſt diſcovered that my faithful Lubin was with me. The little affectionate animal crept cloſe up to me, licking my hands and face, as tho' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>MY lot is hard, Celia, very hard; but I endeavour to keep up my ſpirits, as well as I am able, and conduct myſelf in ſuch a manner as my own heart may acquit me.</p>
                     <p>When I was quite recovered from my ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, my mother called me one day into her
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:029439_0096_0FE111B774C2F158"/>
dreſſing-room and aſſured me, ſhe would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my elopement, on condition I would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her of the cauſe, and by what means I came in the ſhocking ſituation already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. You may be certain I felt myſelf greatly agitated, as I knew I could not give this dear parent the ſatisfaction ſhe required, without planting a dagger in her heart. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, my friend, I cannot but feel thankful, that in my frenzy I did not diſcover the whole horrid ſecret, as it would have only involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us all in much greater diſtreſs than we experience at preſent.</p>
                     <p>I remained ſilent to my mother's queſtion, but could not reſtrain my tears. She repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; conjuring me, in the moſt ſolemn manner, not to trifle with her, but to tell her what urged me to deſert my home and friends.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! my dear mother," ſaid I, "do not aſk, indeed I cannot tell you. Suffer me to be ſilent on this ſubject; and, in every fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture action of my life, I will implicitly obey you." "I fear, Meriel," ſaid my mother, "you have ſome unworthy reaſons for this concealment: tell me, then, who adviſed you to this imprudent ſtep, and who accompanied you in your flight?" "No one," ſaid I, "the reſolution was haſtily formed, and as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:029439_0097_0FE111BCC1BDADC0"/>
executed; but I had no adviſer, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, nor do I think I ever went farther than the wood, where I was diſcovered."</p>
                     <p>"Meriel! Meriel!" ſaid my mother, "I cannot believe you. It appears altogether improbable, that a young woman, without any apparent cauſe, ſhould form a haſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of running away; that ſhe ſhould chuſe a tempeſtuous night to make her eſcape, without a companion, and hide herſelf in a wood with a deſign to ſtarve herſelf to death. Tell me, child, and tell me ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, did you not once love Pringle?" "I thought I did, but it was a miſtake of the heart."</p>
                     <p>"I fear, Meriel, that miſtake has led to your ruin: he certainly accompanied you in your flight, and my child is loſt to honour and to virtue. Is not this the cauſe of your obſtinate ſilence: do you not fear that the villain, whom in your heart you ſtill love, ſhould be brought to anſwer for his inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man deſertion of you."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! no my dear mother," ſaid I, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling my tears, "indeed you wrong me, I never entertained a thought that I ſhould bluſh to own, and if it was my laſt moment, I could, with ſafety to my conſcience, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:029439_0098_0FE111BF6A42C578"/>
that neither Mr. Pringle, nor any of his family knew of my going away."</p>
                     <p>"Strange infatuation," ſaid ſhe, angrily, "to aſſert ſuch falſehoods. Oh Meriel! I had hoped better from you; but I am ſorry to ſay, in this inſtance, I can place no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in your veracity." Here my father entered the room, and would you believe it poſſible, Celia, he repeated to me every queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which my mother had aſked before. Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment riveted my tongue. I could not anſwer. My ſilence was accounted obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and my dear mother left me with theſe cruel words: "Diſſembling, obſtinate girl, I can never love you as I once did, though I will ſtrive to forgive you."</p>
                     <p>My father ſcarcely now ever ſpeaks to me, and ſeems in his heart to hate me, as he takes every opportunity in his power of mortifying me; conſtrues my moſt innocent actions into faults, and is continually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining to my mother of my indolence, and ſulkineſs, as he inhumanely terms that want of vivacity, for which he ſo well knows how to account. This ill humour I could bear patiently, but my mother's unkindneſs is worſe than a dagger to my heart. I live in greater ſolitude than ever; I never go out, and when any company comes to the family,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:029439_0099_0FE111C5607A7FB8"/>
I in general retire to my own room; for my feelings are often hurt by the ignorant, I had almoſt ſaid inhuman queſtions, that are aſked me by people who have no other inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in my fate, than as it ſerves to gratify their curioſity. Next week I expect my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther home from ſchool; he does not return again, but is to be articled apprentice to a merchant in London. I ſhall not be ſorry when he is gone, for I expect to ſuffer great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from his unfeeling taunts. Oh! Celia, heaven and you know how little I deſerve them; and that thought ſhall be my comfort and ſupport. Adieu my friend.</p>

                     <p>YOU are, no doubt ſurprized to ſee from whence this letter is dated, and you will be much more ſo, when I inform you of the great change that has taken place in our circumſtances, ſome little time after I laſt wrote to you, as I was ſitting in my own room, indulging the moſt painful ideas, I heard a great confuſion below, and, among the reſt, my mother's voice repeatedly ſcreaming for help. I ran down ſtairs into the parlour, from whence the noiſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and on entering ſaw two ill looking men, one of which had ſeized my father by the collar, and the other was aſſiſting to drag him away. "What is the matter," ſaid I, to the men, "what are you doing with my father?" "Oh! we will do him no harm," ſaid one of them: "he muſt only come away with us to my houſe, at Litchfield, till he has
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:029439_0101_0FE111D7A527C7A0"/>
paid five hundred pounds." "Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds," ſaid I, "why, dear madam," turning to my mother, "to whom does my father owe ſo much money." "Oh child!" ſaid he, "your mother knows nothing about the affair, I not only owe that, but three times the ſum; we are inevitably ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, and all by my own folly. I have been bound for a friend of mine, a young man, at Litchfield, who is gone off, and I ſhall have all his debts to diſcharge." My poor mother ſat weeping; and, on hearing this account, lifted up her eyes in ſpeechleſs agony. I could not bear to ſee her diſtreſs. "It is a large ſum to be ſure gentlemen," ſaid I, "but it ſhall be paid, ſo let my father remain, and do you go away for to night; to-morrow we will ſend you the money." Alas! Celia, how very little I knew of the world. The inhuman men laughed at me, and aſked me, "when I ever heard of bailiffs letting go their priſoner on the bare word of a girl." "If you will not take my word," ſaid I, "leave my fahter and take me, for it will break my dear mother's heart to have him carried to priſon; but, as to me, it matters not what becomes of me." "That won't do neither, Miſs," ſaid they, "we muſt either have the money or take the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man away." Alas!" ſaid I, turning to my mother, "what can I do? they will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:029439_0102_0FE111DA9A666470"/>
him." No my child," ſaid my mother, with more affection in her voice than I had heard for ſome time, "we muſt ſubmit as patiently as we can till to-morrow, and then ſee what can be done. My father went away curſing his evil genius. Why will peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Celia, when they bring misfortune on their own heads, rail at fate; yet you will find it always the caſe, and the more egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grious have been their errors, the more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement their compalints.</p>
                     <p>When they were gone, I exerted myſelf to conſole my mother, but her only anſwer was, "Ah Meriel! what will become of us, I ſee ruin approaching; I know of no way to avoide it, and my poor boy, what will he do." "Let me intreat you my dear mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther," ſaid I, "not to let this accident thus diſtreſs you: can you ſuppoſe, that while I have the means of living in eaſe and comfort, I would ſuffer my parent or my brother to feel any embarraſſment, which it is in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to remove. Did I not ſolemnly promiſe the dear departed ſaint, who made me thus independant, never to forſake you?"</p>
                     <p>"But alas! Meriel, have you not already broke that vow?" "Dear, dear madam, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, forget, that involuntary tranſgreſſion; and believe me, there never was a heart that
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:029439_0103_0FE111E072E86110"/>
glowed with more filial love, or greatful ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, than mine does towards you. My fortune is your's, I will ſhare it with you and my brother to the laſt ſhilling; nay to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of my ſincerity, I would freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it all, and depend on my labour for ſupport." My mother was affected, but it was only for a moment, ſhe again aſſumed a look of coldneſs, and told <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſhe feared I often ſuffered the warmth of my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hurry me into expreſſions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, the nature of which I did not duly conſider. She then bid me good night and left me.</p>
                     <p>Grieved to be thought ſo very unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, by the perſon on earth I moſt loved, moſt wiſhed to ſee happy, I could take no reſt all night. As ſoon as day-light appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I aroſe, and dreſſing myſelf as plain as poſſible, borrowing a black bonnet of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah, I determined to ſet out for Litchfield on foot; but, fearing my mother might be alarmed at my abſence, I left a note inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, in a few words, that I was gone to endeavour to prove myſelf worthy of her love. During my walk I revolved in my mind what ſteps to purſue. Mr. Sutten was joint guardian with my father: I had no doubt he had been ſent for on account of the arreſt, and hoped to prevail on him to
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:029439_0104_0FE111E431DCBD70"/>
advance ſufficient money to make my poor mother eaſy in her mind. I therefore deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to go immediately to the houſe of the bailiff, and learn at whoſe ſuit my father had been arreſted. From thence I would go to the creditor and endeavour to prevail with him to take half the money now, and the reſt when I became my own miſtreſs, which, according to Mrs. Mirvan's will, was to be at eighteen years old. Here buſy reflection aroſe, and told me how very unworthy of my attention my father was, but he is my father ſtill, ſaid I, and tho' he has forgotten his duty towards me, it does not follow that I am to neglect mine to him: beſides, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion teaches us to reward evil with good; and ſurely, if there is any way of awakening the perſon who injures us, to a ſenſe of their guilt, it is by ſhewing them an example of chriſtian charity, and good will; beſides, my mother and brother have not injured me, and why ſhould they ſuffer for the vices of my father? Occupied by theſe reflections, I entered Litchfield, and went directly to the bailiff's houſe. My father was not up; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I did not wiſh to ſee him if he had, ſo I only made the neceſſary enquiries, learnt who the creditor was, and proceeded direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſtreet where he lived. Mr. Leeſon is a man, who, for many years, ſerved a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman in London, as I have been told, tho'
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:029439_0105_0FE111E9930120A8"/>
in what capacity, I never heard. In his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he accumulated a conſiderable fortune, and married a lady, a particular <hi>friend</hi> of his lordſhip's. Soon after he procured a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, with which he came down to Litchfield, the place of his lady's birth, where he is now reckoned a very great man. This was the perſon who had occaſioned my father's impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment. On knocking at the door a ſervant appeared yawning, and examining my dreſs with a ſcrutinizing eye, aſked what I wanted. "I wiſh too ſee Mr. Leeſon," ſaid I, "on particular buſineſs." "Humph," ſaid the fellow, ſtanding with his back againſt the wall, his hands in his breeches pockets, "you muſt wait a good while before you can ſee him, for he is not up yet." "Pray friend," ſaid I, "give me leave to go in and ſit down till your maſter does get up." "You may go down ſtairs," ſaid he, "if you will, and when maſter is ſtirring, I will let you know."</p>
                     <p>Humiliating, as it was, I went down ſtairs, ſat down by the kitchen fire and dried my feet, which were wet, ſome rain having fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in the night; my petticoat was alſo plaſhed with dirt. About nine o'clock, a ſpruce young woman, in a long white bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gown, came into the kitchen, and looking at me with a ſort of contemptuous ſneer,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:029439_0106_0FE111ED0C7D9608"/>
cries, "ſervant ma'am, pray who may you want?" Imagining, from her appearance, and the manner in which ſhe put the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſhe might be ſome relation of the family, I roſe from my ſeat, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I had buſineſs of much importance with Mr. Leeſon. "Aye Mrs. Bridget," cried a footman, who was cleaning ſome ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver candleſticks, at the dreſſer; "when my lady's bell rings, you muſt let maſter know, this here young body has been waiting here ever ſince eight o'clock." A young laſs, in appearance a menial ſervant, now appeared, and ſpreading a fine napkin on the table, brought the breakfaſt things, toaſted ſome oat cakes, and Mrs. Bridget and Mr. James ſat very comfortably down to breakfaſt; but during their repaſt, neither aſked me if I would partake, tho' they endeavoured to gratify their curioſity, by aſking, how far I had walked, if I had been long in the country, and many other queſtions, equally imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and inſignificant; to all which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in little more than monoſyllables. At length the bell rang, and Mrs. Bridget making a haſty finiſh of her breakfaſt, ran up ſtairs: ſoon after, the footman having equip'd himſelf as a valet, went out of the kitchen. I was now once more leſt to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but had not indulged reflection long, before the girl, who had prepared the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:029439_0107_0FE111F2F5BFE340"/>
came and ſat down, in order to eat her own. She pour'd out two cups of tea, got up and held the oat cake (which was almoſt cold) to the ſire, then caſting a look, firſt at me, then at the table, in a mild accent, as tho' fearful of giving offence, ſaid, "I am afraid you have not breakfaſted ma'am; pray eat a bit, and take this cup of tea," hoiding the plate and tea towards me. "Mrs. Bridget is very proud ma'am, and Mr. James does nothing but what he thinks ſhe will like; but I thinks your London folks are all proud; they ſerves only to make places uncomfortable. Do ma'am take it; I wiſh it was hotter and better." "It is very good," ſaid I, taking a bit; for the poor girl's goodneſs of heart was ſo conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous that I could not mortify her by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal. She ſmiled, began drinking her own tea, and continued: "Mr. James was quite a different ſort of a body, I aſſures you ma'am before he went to London laſt ſummer with my miſtreſs; dear heart, he and I were ſo comfortable and happy, but when they came home my lady brought Mrs. Bridget with her, and ever ſince"—She pauſed; I ſaw her eyes gliſten. Poor girl, thought I, James is falſe hearted, he has forſaken thee for Bridget; and yet, if he had but diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to perceive the difference between the two hearts, how gladly would he return to
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:029439_0108_0FE111F728656670"/>
one ſo gentle and tender. Here I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by Mr. James himſelf, who told me his maſter deſired me to walk up. I bade the kind hearted girl good morning, and followed James into the preſence of his maſter.</p>
                     <p>"Well, young woman," ſaid Mr. Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who was ſtanding with his back to the fire, and his hands behind him. (Celia I muſt here digreſs to give you ſome ſmall idea of his perſon and manner.) A perſon rather above the middle ſize, a face, the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of which, might have been termed regular, and even pleaſing, had benevolence, good humour or politeneſs been any way diſcernable in it, inſtead of which there was an inſolent pertneſs, a ſupercilious, ſelf-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving ſmile, that to my idea portrayed nothing but ignorance, pride and conceit.</p>
                     <p>"Well, young woman," ſaid he, "what may be your commands with me."</p>
                     <p>"You are ſir, I underſtand, the perſon who has cauſed Mr. Howard to be arreſted." He anſwered in the affirmative.</p>
                     <p>"I waited on you, ſir, to make ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal concerning this affair, in hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the means of his obtaining his liberty."</p>
                     <p>

"What, do you belong to Mrs. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour?"</p>
                     <p>"Belong to who ſir?" in an accent of ſurprize.</p>
                     <p>"To Mrs. Belmour; the woman for whom Howard has thus involved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf."</p>
                     <p>"I underſtood, ſir, that he was bound for a friend."</p>
                     <p>"Well child, ſhe was his friend, my friend, any body's friend: why ſure you know her."</p>
                     <p>"Indeed, ſir, I never heard of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: I am Mr. Howards daughter."</p>
                     <p>"Bleſs my ſoul! Mr. Howard's daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are you; well I have often heard of you, tho' I never had the pleaſure of ſeeing you before. I remember hearing of that ſtrange affair of your running away after En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign Pringle, and when he refuſed to have any thing to ſay to you, being afraid to go home again, you hid yourſelf in a wood, and went out of your ſenſes."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="90" facs="unknown:029439_0110_0FE112BB861870A8"/>
Celia, can you for a moment ſuppoſe what, at that inſtant, were my feelings; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able any longer to ſupport myſelf I ſunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the neareſt chair, (for I had been kept ſtanding) and burſt into tears.</p>
                     <p>"'Pon honour, Miſs," ſaid he, "I beg pardon, I did not mean to make you uneaſy; but when one hears ſuch ſtrange ſtories, one likes, you know, to come at the truth: 'pon my ſoul I wiſh I had been in Pringles place, I ſhould not have driven ſuch a pretty little kind ſoul to diſpair."</p>
                     <p>During this ſpeech he had drawn nearer to me and had taken one of my hands, which I drew from him with diſdain. "Sir," ſaid I, with as much compoſure as I could aſſume, "you have been totally miſinformed about that unhappy affair; and, pardon me, if I ſay, that it can be no buſineſs of your's, to enquire, what were the motives of a conduct, which, I find, has caſt a fatal ſhade upon my reputation; I do not think myſelf accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for my actions, to you or any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different perſon: it is ſufficient that heaven and my own heart acquits me of evil.

                     <p>I HAVE not had a moment to devote to my dear Celia ſince I diſpatched the laſt, but as I know your friendly heart ſhares all the ſufferings of your Meriel, I will now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue my narrative.</p>
                     <p>When Mr. Sutten appeared, he was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriſed to ſee me at Litchfield, and when I told him of my viſit to Mr. Leeſon, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very angry and ſaid, "with his good will, I ſhould not pay a farthing, and at any rate I ſhould not have the money, till I was of age; for I might, if I attempted to extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate my father from his preſent difficulites, ſoon be reduced to beggary, and leave my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without the power of aſſiſting my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; who was far more deſerving my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and duty."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="94" facs="unknown:029439_0114_0FE112090C230670"/>
"It is on her account, ſir," ſaid I, "that I am thus anxious. Her happineſs is bound up with my father's, and while he is under confinement ſhe will be miſerable; beſides, Mr. Sutten, ſhe does not think I love her, does not think me capable of doing a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy action. Oh! ſir, give me the power to convince her, that my own intereſt and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is of little value when put in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with her's."</p>
                     <p>"My dear miſs Howard," ſaid he, "you muſt confeſs appearances have been ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt you. I will acknowledge I myſelf have had my doubts concerning the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of your heart."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! I know," ſaid I, "there is a fatal myſtery involves my conduct, a myſtery which I never can reveal."</p>
                     <p>"Nor will I deſire it," replied the humane Mr. Sutten, "I ſee at this moment ſuch traits of genuine goodneſs, ſuch proofs of a mind, impreſſed with a juſt ſenſe of its du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that I ſhall always think you had ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry juſt cauſe for your paſt conduct, nor will I believe it poſſible for a heart capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſuch noble, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="unknown:029439_0115_0FE1120E32EFEAC0"/>
I thanked him for his good opinion, and he proceeded: "You muſt conſider, Miſs Howard, that you are young, very young; you know but little of the world, of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence can form no juſt value of that inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, which, believe me, can alone ſecure you friends. Beauty and merit, my dear girl, are oftener a prejudice than a benefit to the poſeſſors; it is an object of envy to your own ſex; and, ſorry I am to add, in general excites no other ideas in the boſom of ours, than to lead them to endeavour to vitiate thoſe principles they pretend to adore; let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, therefore, to ſet a juſt value on that independence, with which it has pleaſed heaven to bleſs you; aſſiſt your parents as far as you can, without hurting yourſelf, and remember, that to ſecure the friendſhip of others you muſt not need their aſſiſtance."</p>
                     <p>This, my dear Celia, was arguing like a cold philoſopher, and a man of the world; but it was not ſpeaking with the ſpirit of chriſtianity, or with the enthuſiaſm of a heart that glows with benevolence to all its fellow creatures. The dear leſſons which I imbibed at Bologne taught me to regard my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf but in a ſecondary light, when any thing praiſe-worthy was to be performed, and to remember only the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

<pb n="96" facs="unknown:029439_0116_0FE11213570207A8"/>
and, like the good Samaritan to pour oil and wine into the wounds of our ſuffering fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creatures; but to proceed:</p>
                     <p>Mr. Sutten refuſed to advance a ſhilling, and I was forced to return to my mother, diſappointed, dejected, and weary.</p>
                     <p>Two days after, an execution was ſent to Woodbine Cot; my poor mother and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf were obliged to remove to Litchfield, where we took a ſmall lodging near the houſe where my father was, where we remained till the eſtate was ſold and all paid away to the laſt farthing, nor was even that enough to anſwer all the demands that were continually pouring in from all quarters; beſides, when the eſtate came to be ſold, it was found ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbered with mortgages, &amp;c. that it would not ſell for above half its value. When all was ſettled, and my father at liberty, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined that we ſhould ſet forward to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, where my father inſiſted we could live much cheaper than in the country, where we were ſo well known. There was ſtill the intereſt of my four thouſand pounds, which as it was at my own diſpoſal, I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to devote to the ſupport of the family. All our ſervants were diſcharged, poor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah too; you cannot think, Celia, what I ſuffered on being ſeparated from this faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:029439_0117_0FE11218AEE13498"/>
woman. She offered to ſtay with us without being paid; but my mother would not conſent to reeicve an obligation from an inferior. I thought the reſolution ſavoured of pride; but we all have our failings, and perhaps pride in ſome degree, is laudable.</p>
                     <p>On our arrival in town, we took a ſmall lodging and hired a young woman to do the moſt laborious part of our domeſtic buſineſs; the reſt' it is my province to perform; and, believe me, I do it chearfully. It employs my mind, prevents my taking melancholy retroſpects, and I think contributes to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove both my health and ſpirits. We have paid a viſit to my father's eldeſt ſiſter. She is married to a counſellor, who has made a genteel independence by his profeſſion. My aunt is a woman whoſe character I do not well know how to develope. She is in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral affable, condeſcending, and chearful; and in converſation, gives evident proofs of a genteel education, and a brilliant under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; but, with all is ſo tinctured with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and tho' upwards of forty, ſtill poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that ſpirit of coquetry, that in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure obſcures her good qualities. Her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Heſter and Suſan, have had, what is termed a faſhionable education, that is, they can daub a fan mount, jumble the keys of the harpſichord, and jabber an unintelligible
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:029439_0118_0FE1121CBB87E610"/>
jargon, which they call French. They are realy lovely girls. Heſter, in particular, ſeems calculated to inſpire love and reſpect, wherever ſhe appears. Suſan is more vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, but, with all can make herſelf extremely agreeable. They are both ſpoilt by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who, having taken it into her head, that their beauty will certainly recommend them to men of rank and fortune, is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually filling the poor girls' minds with that kind of vanity, and eager deſire of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, that in general fails of the deſired effect, and repels the admiration, which it is deſigned to attract. Their naturally good diſpoſitions are by theſe means totally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and inſtead of being the engaging, innoecnt, unaffected girls, which nature form'd them, they appear, in a mixed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, a combination of pride, vanity, and ſelf-conceit.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Moſop, their father, is haughty, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and forbidding in his manner, poſeſſes a great deal, of what is called family pride: has little feeling and leſs good nature, yet on the whole is deemed a reſpectable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. He is ſtrictly honeſt in his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, pays every one their due to the utmoſt farthing, but will not beſtow the leaſt trifle in charity, becauſe he conſiders conſtantly paying the poor rate to be a ſufficient diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge

of that duty. The query with me, is, whether he would pay that ſum yearly if not obliged to it; if not, where is the merit of paying it now. Oh! Celia, how do I hate thoſe luke-warm hearts. You may remember I always ſhewed a diſlike to the cool doctrines of philoſophy. I could never have a good opinion of a perſon who regards every ſurrounding object with the ſtoical eye of apathy. I am ſure they muſt poſſeſs hearts, rendered impenetrable by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to thoſe fine feelings, which, tho' at ſome moments they may diſtreſs, in general ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and expand the ſoul. For my own part, Celia, I am as weak as an infant, whenever a ſcene of diſtreſs or happineſs meets my eye, I have a tear of ſympathy for the one, and a ſmile of gratulation for the other; and the ſmile and the tear, mingle ſo ſweetly with each other, that every faculty is harmonized by the union, and I am at a loſs to tell which ſenſation is the moſt exquiſitely delightful. Then let the unfeeling boaſt the philoſophic calmneſs of their tempers. I will not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to aver, that tho' they may eſcape many an acute pang, that wrings the heart of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, they know not what true pleaſure is. But I am ſtrangely digreſſing from my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. You will wonder perhaps, how I ſo ſoon comprehended the character of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle's family: believe me, Celia, it was not
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:029439_0120_0FE11226493C2E78"/>
by my own penetration that I diſcovered them. From my own obſervations, I ſhould have ſuppoſed Mr. Moſſop an agreeable man, his wife a charming, amiable woman, and the two young ladies the ſweeteſt, moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging girls in the world; nay, at this very moment, I feel ſo inclined to love the whole family, that I think the diſagreeable traits in their characters have been exaggerated. It was to a Mr. Rainsforth, that I was indebted for this minute delineation of them. This Mr. Rainsforth is an agreeable young man, whom I have frequently ſeen at my uncle's, and at firſt thought he was partial to my couſin Heſter, but I find I was miſtaken in this ſuppoſition, as his intimacy in the family proceeds from his having been ſchool-fellow with young Moſſop, whom I have as yet ſeen but little of.</p>
                     <p>Rainsforth is the ſon of a merchant, in Plymouth. His mother died when he was an infant, and his father has, within theſe few years, married a woman many years younger than himſelf, by whom he has a young family. Frederic has a ſmall fortune independent of his father, and is beſides a lieutenant in the navy. My father ſeems very partial to him; that, you will ſay, is no great recommendation; but I flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Celia, this unhappy father begins to ſee
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:029439_0121_0FE1122BF0328040"/>
his errors, and will, in future atone for them. I think, tho' our income is circumſcribed, and our ſituation greatly altered, my dear mother is much happier than I ever ſaw her. I cannot boaſt of much happineſs myſelf; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, painful rembrance, damps every little pleaſure or amuſement that is offered to my notice; yet, when I look round me, and behold many who are perhaps my ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors in worth and virtue, periſhing for want of the common neceſſaries of life; oppreſſed with ſickneſs; ſurrounded with children, who look up to them for that ſupport, which they have not to beſtow: when I ſee theſe things, my friend, I lift up my heart in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gratitude to that Providence, who has, thro' life, given a portion into my hand, the over plus of which may, in ſome little degree, ſerve to cheer the ſons and daughters of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. You ſmile to hear me talk of having any to ſpare from my little income. Oh! my dear girl, had I but a ſhilling in my poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, I could not call it my own, if I ſaw a fellow creature whoſe heart would be in the leaſt lightened by ſharing it with me.</p>
                     <p>My aunt has promiſed to take me to a play. I am fond reading dramatic works, and form great expectations of amuſement from ſeeing a performance. I will certainly give you
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:029439_0122_0FE1123144C442B8"/>
ſome account of my entertainment when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I go. Till then, and ever, believe me affectionately your's.</p>

my dear mother; and, I am ſure, Celia, I did it without a thought of harm. I had been out a little way yeſterday, and was returning in the cloſe of the evening, when I heard a very genteel looking elderly gentleman enquiring the way to a ſtreet which lay in my way home; the perſon whom he addreſſed could not direct him, and I, unconſcious of any impropriety, ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped forward and told him, as it lay in my way, I would ſhew him the place he enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for: he ſeemed much obliged to me, and ſaid, "as we were going the ſame way I might as well take hold of his arm;" but this, as he was quite a ſtranger, I refuſed to do; however, I could not help anſwering ſome civil queſtions, which he aſked, and when we arrived at the ſtreet he had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, he inſiſted on ſeeing me ſafe home: this I remonſtrated againſt, ſaying, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides giving him unneceſſary trouble, it would make my mother very angry with me. At this he declared he knew my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very well, and he was not at all afraid of her anger, as he was certain it lay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> his power to appeaſe it. I was ſurpriſed, you may imagine, and indeed very uneaſy all the reſt of the way, as I knew how offended my mother would be, at ſeeing a ſtranger come home with me. When the ſervant opened the door he walked in without any
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:029439_0124_0FE111CE791BEF20"/>
ceremony, and going into the parlour which was occupied by the gentlewoman who keeps the houſe, he thus addreſſed her, "Servant, my good madam, your lovely daughter here, having kindly given me an invitation home, I flatter myſelf we ſhall ſpend a chearful evening, and you and I, my good mother, ſhall not diſagree, I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant." Mrs. Fermor ſtared, and I felt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fink into the earth.</p>
                     <p>"You are under a miſtake, ſir," ſaid I, "pray leave me." "What, leave you, my little dove, when you have been ſo very kind, no, no! hardly ſuch a fool as that; come mother, what ſhall I order in for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and what wine will you drink?" "Miſs Howard," ſaid Mrs. Fermor, "I am over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with aſtoniſhment; how have you dared to bring this gentleman here to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult me?" "Indeed madam," I replied, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified beyond meaſure, "I am innocent of any intention to offend you; this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man"—"Why, I can tell the tale as well as you my pretty one," ſaid he, interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me: "you muſt know, madam, I was coming into Weſtminſter, and did not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know my way, ſo, this pretty, kind heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed damſel was ſo good as to ſhew me, that is all, ma'am and ſo in return, I am only grateful, and would willingly treat you with

good ſupper, and as far as ten guineas would go."</p>
                     <p>At this moment my father came in, and ſeeing me ſtand trembling in the parlour, a freſh ſcene of confuſion inſued, which ended in the whole family believing I had invited the old gentleman home with me, merely out of levity, and as Mrs. Fermor called it, an indiſcreet frolic. You may ſuppoſe how rigorous my mother was, how angry my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for tho' in his heart, he has not the leaſt regard for real virtue he always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends great attention to my conduct, and this evening declared he would rather follow me to the grave than ſee me loſt to honour.</p>
                     <p>Oh! Celia, how my ſoul deteſts his hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy.

                     <p>My aunt has juſt called, and after a great deal of perſuaſion, has prevailed with my mother to let me go to the play to-morrow evening; I am to go out this afternoon with my couſins, to purchaſe ſome few articles of dreſs neceſſary to my appearing at a public place, as my aunt always takes my couſins to the moſt conſpicuous part of the theatre. Well, it will be of little conſequence to me, where we ſit; I go to ſee and not to be ſeen, I wiſh to be amuſed myſelf, but have not the leaſt ambition to be the amuſement of others, either from my perſon, dreſs or manner.</p>
                     <p>Well, Celia, had I ever been vain of my perſon, I ſhould now be perfectly cured of ſo ridiculous a vanity; but it is happy for me, that I never thought my face more than paſſable; and as to my ſhape, I knew it had not the ſmalleſt pretentions to either grace or elegance; and, by having this humble opinion, I have eſcaped a ſevere mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:029439_0127_0FE1124BC11FB840"/>
for you know, my Celia, the ſevereſt reflections looſe their force, when we can liſten to them with good humour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn an anſwer with a ſmile.</p>
                     <p>I accompanied my aunt and couſins to a milliner's; Mr. Rainsforth and young Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop were of the party. I am aſtoniſhed how young men can ſuffer themſelves to be dragged as it were to ſuch places, and have the patience to liſten to a tedious deſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on gauzes, ribbons, lace and a hundred other trifles, almoſt below the notice of a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional being. But, if I was ſurpriſed at that, how much more was I to ſee a parcel of powdered effeminate animals, for I will not call them men, ſtuck up behind a counter, meaſuring a peny-worth of tape or a ſmaller quantity perhaps; telling you with the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of a philoſopher, that ſuch a ribond become your delicate complexion; ſuch a cap ſet off your features to advantage, &amp;c. And, will you believe it poſſible, that one morning being in a perfumer's ſhop, I ſaw an officer in the army, purchaſing chicken gloves, violet powder and cold cream, aye, and for his own uſe too, for the maſter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me he had neither wife nor ſiſter, to whom ſuch things might have been of uſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="108" facs="unknown:029439_0128_0FE1124F0F6CA390"/>
Well, to the milliner's we went, where Heſter and Suſan having choſen their caps. I was pleaſed with the choice of the fomer, and ſaid I would have one like it. "Lord, my dear," ſaid my aunt, "how can you think of ſuch a thing, pretty women you know may wear any thing, but thoſe that are plain ſhould ſtudy what will moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them." "Aye," cried young Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop, "my couſin to be ſure ſhould not wear any thing that atrtacts general notice." "Here," ſaid Suſan, "here Meriel, is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pretty cap, I think it will become you vaſtly." It was etremely plain, having no ornament but a knott of white ſattin ribbon.</p>
                     <p>"You are quite right, couſin," ſaid I, "this cap will certainly ſuit me beſt. I never love to be fine, and what will be becoming on you, will only appear an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of finery on me." I ſaid this with a ſmile, as I tried on the cap. Mr. Rainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth told my aunt he thought true beauty required few ornaments. "Come, come, you rally," ſaid ſhe, "you can't think Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riel handſome." He made no anſwer, but ſmiling, ſung the following ſtanza, which, as it contained a delicate compliment, you will pardon me if I here repeat it.</p>

                     <l>Depicted in her face.</l>
                     <p>But, my Celia will ſay my letters begin to be very inſipid, when I can find no other theme than the repetition of my own praiſe. Forgive me, dear girl, this time, I will be careful how I offend again.</p>

                     <p>My entertainment laſt night, exceeded my moſt ſanguine expectations; the houſe, the lights, the brilliant and numerous audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, on my firſt entrance, filled me with ſilent aſtoniſhment; but my couſins declare they never will go to the play with me again, for at the pathetic and intereſting parts, I could not conceal my emotion. It was Jane Shore. Long did I ſtruggle to ſuppreſs my tears; the effort was vain, and when in the laſt ſcene, they drag the juſt reconciled huſband from the arms of his dying wife, the half ſmothered ſobs burſt forth, and I fell back in an hyſteric. You cannot think, how I was laughed at, and my couſins declare they were ſo ſhocked at my behaviour, that they ſhall be aſhamed to ſhew their faces at the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe again this ſeaſon. "One would think
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:029439_0130_0FE1125A5EB57B10"/>
child," ſaid my aunt, in a peeviſh tone, as I began to recover, "you never had ſeen a play in your life before." "Well, you know I never did," ſaid I, aloud. This compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my diſgrace, and my aunt turning toward the ſtage, noticed me no more the whole evening.</p>
                     <p>I think if I were to go again, I ſhould like to ſit in ſome unnoticed corner, where I could give ſenſibility the reins, and whilſt I wept the woes of thoſe whoſe ſorrows now reſt in the ſilent grave, I would ſo mould my heart, as it ſhould be ever ready to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and alleviate the afflictions of thoſe who ſtill move on the buſy ſtage of life.</p>
                     <p>One thing, my couſins informed me of, which conſiderably damped my pleaſure during the evening. They ſaid, that many of the beautiful, elegant women, whom I ſaw in the boxes, were the ſlaves of vice, and purchaſed the gaudy trappings, by which they were adorned, by the wages of guilt; and that (but I can hardly think it poſſible) ſome of them are ſo loſt to every ſenſe of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that they come to thoſe public places with no other view than to attract new lovers; and what is ſtill worſe, that in a few years; nay, perhaps even in a few months, I may ſee thoſe lovely blooming women walking the ſtreets,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:029439_0131_0FE1125FF12D66B8"/>
ſubject to the inſults of every brutal paſſenger, and ſinking into an untimely grave, under the complicated evils of poverty, ſickneſs and diſgrace. I felt my eyes fill as Heſter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; and do you not pity them, ſaid I: "La! couſin," ſaid ſhe, "you are the ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt girl; you make one laugh to ſee you now, with that long diſmal face, talking about pity for ſuch wretches." "Perhaps," ſaid I, "they had no friend to teach them better, and ſurely, tho' we may ſhudder with deteſtation at their vices, humanity ſtill leads us to pity their ſufferings." "You are as old faſhioned in your notions, Meriel," ſaid my aunt, who had overheard as, "as you are in your dreſs and manner. You will know better child when you have ſeen a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more of the world." I muſt now quit my pen to aſſiſt in ſome neceſſary domeſtic buſineſs. Believe me, Celia, there is no pleaſure ſo agreeable as writing to you.</p>

                     <p>LAST night, having ſpent the evening with my father and mother, at my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle's; when we were coming home Mr. Rains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth put a letter into my hand as he handed me into the coach: I could not well return it or I would, ſo was obliged to put it in my pocket; however, I reſolved not to open it till I had firſt ſhewn it to my mother. When we got home, it was late, and all immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retired to bed. I will confeſs it coſt me no little trouble to ſtiflle the curioſity that prompted me to open the letter. I put it in a drawer and turned the key; but, juſt then recollecting that I wanted ſomething that was in that identical drawer, I unlocked it again, took up the letter, read the addreſs, looked attentively if the wafer was dry; and after viewing it on every ſide near a dozen times,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:029439_0133_0FE1126AE997D3C0"/>
reſolution at length repelled curioſity, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned it to the drawer and locked it again, without once recollecting why I had opened it the ſecond time.</p>
                     <p>In the morning I waited till we had done breakfaſt, and then putting the letter into my mother's hand, ſaid, "I hope, my dear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, this will convince you I would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly be guilty of an impropriety, or have a concealment of this nature from my beſt friend." She took it with a cold look of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, and having read it, ſaid "I ſuppoſe you know the contents." "Indeed I do not," was the reply. "You can gueſs, I imagine," ſaid ſhe; "no gentleman would have had the temerity to put a letter into a young la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's hand in ſuch a clandeſtine manner, had he not been pretty certain that it would not be refuſed." "Good heavens!" ſaid I, burſting into tears, "ſhall I never regain your confidence? Muſt every action, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver innocent, be miſconſtrued or liable to ſuſpicion." "Why Meriel," ſaid ſhe, "will you endeavour to perſuade me, Mr. Rains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth has never entertained you on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of love." "If I may be believed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam," ſaid I, with a firm voice, "he never uttered a ſyllable to me that could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued into more than common politeneſs." "Well, child, read the letter then, and tell
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:029439_0134_0FE1126F063EC910"/>
me your opinion of the contents." I fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> my face glow as I caſt my eye over the letter, which contained a profeſſion of ardent affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and an offer of his hand, if my father approved the union.</p>
                     <p>"You aſk my opinion, dear mother," ſaid I, "and I will candidly give it; I think Mr. Rainsforth a very amiable young man, from what little I have ſeen, but it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that I can form any juſt idea of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, from ſo ſhort an acquaintance; If when upon a greater intimacy, I ſhould find him in reality poſſeſſed of thoſe valuable qualifications, honour and benevolence, and my father and yourſelf have no objection, I will not heſitate to confeſs, I could give him my hand, not only without reluctance, but with pleaſure."</p>
                     <p>"But ſuppoſe, Meriel, your father ſhould object." "If you, madam, ſhould alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve, I hope I know my duty too well to complain; ſince your knowledge of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general, muſt make you a much better judge of what will be really conducive to my happineſs, than I can poſſibly be myſelf; however, madam, if ſuch objections ſhould ariſe, I hope you will inform me ſoon, that I may early begin to teach my heart a leſſon which, ſome little time hence, I may find a

difficulty in making it obey." My mother made no anſwer, and ſoon after I left the room; in the afternoon Mr. Rainsforth cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; I felt the colour fluſh to my face: when he entered he glanced his eyes toward me; but I believe they brought him no intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence concerning the reception his letter had met with. He had not been ſeated above ten minutes before my mother made ſome excuſe to ſend me out of the room; I underſtood her perfectly, and was not in haſte to return; in about an hour I was ſent for to make tea, but it was the moſt unſocial meal I had ever partaken of, when Rains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth was preſent: he was ſilent; I was embarraſſed, and my father and mother, as is in general the caſe, ſpoke to each other but little. When tea was over he took his leave, when my father acquainted me I had his permiſſion to recieve his addreſſes; ſaid he believed him a man of honour, and, if his friends raiſed no objection to the union, he thought the ſooner it was compleated the better. Does not this eagerneſs to diſpoſe of me, ſhew how painful my preſence is to him? Indeed I do not wonder at it, we ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom like to be much in company with thoſe perſons whom we are conſcious of having injured.</p>

And now, my dear Celia, you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps wonder at my ſo readily liſtening to an offer of marriage from a man with whom I have ſo ſmall an acquaintance, but indeed my ſituation at home is far from being agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. My mother's affections ſeem totally alienated from me, and laviſhed with redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led tenderneſs on my brother, who, I am ſorry to ſay, repays it with ingratitude and diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. He is continually teizing her for money, and tho' he is conſcious there is no ſource from whence that money can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, except from me, yet he is continually tormenting me by ſome ill natured trick or other. If we are in a mixed company, every word I utter is turned into ridicule. If I ſit ſilent, then ſiſter is ſtudying ſomething cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſay; if I deliver my ſentiments on any ſubject that excites my ſenſibility or venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then ſiſter is going to turn a ſentimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal actreſs, or a methodiſt preacher; even the reſpect I pay to my religious duties is an object of ridicule, in which my pretty couſins always join. If I expreſs my diſlike of cards, gadding, and its attendant ſcandal, and my love of retirement, ſtudy and domeſtic em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, then he wonders what Mrs. Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van could mean by leaving me a fortune, who could be ſo well content with

To which my aunt often replies, aye, Meriel would make an excellent poor man's wife; and theſe expreſſions often eſcape them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore people, who think it degrading to be able to perform, for themſelves, any of the neceſſary offices of life; and would bluſh to death were they ſuppoſed to know how to make or mend their own linen; for my own part, I cannot help thinking, if thoſe fine ladies had a little more uſeful employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on their hands, they would not have ſo much time to inveſtigate and expoſe the actions of their neighbours.</p>
                     <p>You muſt imagine, my dear girl, that I lead but an uncomfortable kind of life; and Mr. Rainsforth always ſhews that attention to me, and takes my part, with ſuch delicacy as muſt unavoidably awaken my gratitude, if not my affection; and believe me I now begin to feel the difference between a real attachment and the illuſive wanderings of the heart. I know how to value the virtues of my lover, at the ſame time I feel a much ſtronger inclination to act in all things with that propriety as may render me reſpected. I feel now the true value of reputation, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and virtue, becauſe I entertain a hope of
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:029439_0138_0FE11281642AB290"/>
being one day united to a man, whoſe charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would be injured by my want of either: and, oh! my Celia, what a bluſh of confuſion often ſpreads my cheeks, when I reflect on the letters I wrote to Pringle; how do I ſhudder at the bare poſſibility of thoſe letters one day coming to the eye of Mr. Rainsforth. Wrote, as they were, at a time when my imagination was ſo ſtrongly tinctured with the ſtyle of the books I had been reading, that I almoſt involuntarily wrote the very ſentiments which I had juſt embibed, with all the enthuſiaſm of romantic affection. Ah! Celia, thoſe books drew very deceitful pictures of human life, their falſe colouring had raiſed my expectations and exalted my ideas, of love and friendſhip, far above any thing I can find in the little circle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance I have formed. Perhaps thoſe elevated ſentiments and actions may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to people of an elevated ſphere of life, for I never remember meeting with any hero or heroine of a ſtory, but either were at firſt, or afterwards proved to be perſons of rank and fortune: but thoſe are people ſo far above me, I can never hope to form any acquaintance with them. I ſee them daily paſs me in their carriages, ſurrounded with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, attended with reſpect; yet ſurely if I know my own heart, I do not envy them, except, when I think of the power they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:029439_0139_0FE112876B5AADB8"/>
to cheer the poor wretch humbled by affliction, and to cauſe the broken heart to rejoice. Envy, did I ſay, oh! no, it is not envy, it is a ſentiment I cannot find a name for, it is a wiſh to enjoy thoſe tranſporting feelings myſelf, without taking from their felicity; it is an earneſt deſire to promote, not decreaſe, the happineſs of every human being.</p>
                     <p>You, my Celia, ſecluded from the world, in devout retirement, can form but a faint idea of the many miſeries with which this variegated world abounds. Yes, my friend, and there are pleaſures too, but they are not in general ſuited to my taſte. I hate a crowd; it may for a moment dazzle the ſenſes, but it leaves no impreſſion on the heart. In my opinion, we cannot experience real pleaſure, if we are devoid of happineſs; and of this I am certain, happineſs can ſeldom be drawn from external objects, but is ſure to dwell in the heart, conſcious of performing its duty.

                     <p>SINCE my laſt, few incidents have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, worthy the notice of my Celia, except that Mr. Rainsforth, being my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared lover, has aſtoniſhed all my uncle's family. My mother ſays ſhe is ſure Heſter and Suſan are ready to burſt with envy; I cannot think it. That dear woman has met with ſo many painful incidents, in her way thro' life, that her naturally amiable temper, is ſoured, and ſhe views every thing with a jaundiced eye. My couſins ſeem highly delighted with the idea of an approaching wedding, and declare they will be my bride maids. They are miſtaken in thinking the wedding will be ſo ſoon, Mr. Rainsforth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to join his ſhip, which belongs to the grand ſleet at Spithead, and I rather wiſh to remain ſingle till this ſummer's cruiſe
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:029439_0141_0FE1128A22E818A0"/>
is paſt. If he returns ſafe, I need not tell you with what joy I ſhall fulfill my engagements: if not; if it be his fate to fall in the defence of his country, I will come to you my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Celia, and become a penſioner in the convent for life. My religion will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to take the veil; but my vow of celibacy will be as ſincere, breathed from my own heart to the great Judge of all our actions, as tho' I made at the foot of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, ſurrounded by all the pomp of monkiſh ſuperſtition. Pardon me, my beloved friend, I mean no reflection on the religion you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs. I think that it is not the form but the heart that is an acceptable ſacrifice: and the ſoul that humbles itſelf before its Maker, and cries "pardon my numerous tranſgreſſions, I am but a worm before thee, the creature of thy infinite power: if thou ſhouldeſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me, who will dare to be my friend; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of me as in thy wiſdom thou ſhalt think fit; I will not complain, but will take the lot appointed, with ſubmiſſion." That ſoul, my Celia, let its form of worſhip be what it may, will one day ſhine reſplendent in the manſion of its Creator. Oh! with what rapture can we approach the throne of mercy, when with a heart overflowing with gratitude, we can ſay, in the words of our admired Pope:

I thank you a thouſand times, dear, ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able young lady, for the ſweet hope you have authoriſed your father to give me; your conduct has, if poſſible, raiſed you in my eſteem; and I look forward with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of felicity to the moment that ſhall unite us by indiſſoluble ties; for ſure a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who has ſo high a ſenſe of filial duty, muſt ever retain a proper idea of the equally incumbent duties which will ariſe from the married ſtate; her huſband's honour will be ſafe in her hands; her children will look up to her as their friend, and bleſſings will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend her footſteps wherever ſhe appears. Oh! beloved Miſs Howard, my heart, that perfectly underſtands your virtues, exults in paying them the homage due.

                     <p>GRATITUDE will not ſuffer me long to remain ſilent or inattentive, to a letter, the contents of which, ſeem to breath only the ſpirit of ſincerity; nor will I heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to confeſs, that the liberty my parents have granted is perfectly conſonant with the feelings of my own heart. Every one who is honoured with the acquaintance of Mr. Rainsforth, muſt be ſenſible of his worth, and to find oneſelf the object of the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt eſteem, to a truely worthy man, muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly awaken a degree of laudable pride, in a boſom not devoid of ſenſibility. Accept my ſincereſt thanks for the many obliging ſentiments you have expreſſed in my favour, and give me leave to mention a few circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances with which you may be unacquainted,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:029439_0146_0FE112A4A239B030"/>
but which, I think it highly proper, you ſhould be informed of.</p>
                     <p>It is in general reported that I have four thouſand pounds for my fortune. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port is falſe. I have only a fourth part of the ſum. My godmother, Mrs. Mirvan, made the will in my favour, but with theſe reſtrictions; that I ſhould never ſuffer my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to feel the neceſſities of life. At that time, Mr. Rainsforth, there was no proſpect of their ever being reduced from a ſtate of competency, to a dependence on their child; but ſuch is the fluctuating ſtate of human affairs, that this is exactly now the caſe. This ſtate of depedence is extremely painful to me, and I am ſure muſt be ſo to them. It is, therefore, my fixed determination, when I am of age, to ſettle the moiety of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune on my mother. I am under engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for my father at preſent to the amount of five hundred pounds, and the other five hundred muſt be appropriated to the uſe of my brother, during his clerkſhip, and to help him forward a little when that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.</p>
                     <p>This diſpoſition of my little fortune, may make a material difference in your plans of life for the future, and I thought it but right to inform you, that no intereſt of my
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:029439_0147_0FE112A89D5FCE50"/>
own, ſhall ever induce me to alter my reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. If you think me ſtill worthy of your attentions, I am your's. Do not ſmile at my frankneſs, I have not yet learnt to diſguiſe the feelings of my heart. Do not heſitate to give a candid anſwer. If the union is not equally eligible with one, as it would have been with four thouſand pounds, ſeek not to excuſe yourſelf for withdrawing your addreſſes, I will not even require an apology for a conduct, to which I am certain, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the moſt powerful reaſons, could have forced you.</p>

                     <p>SHALL I not chide you, my dear Miſs Howard; ſhall I not tell you what I felt at the reception of your dear unkind let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Dear it will ever be to my fond boſom, becauſe in the ſincerity of your language, I could read the affection of your heart. "Smile at your frankneſs;" how could you think of ſuch a thing. No, I adore you for it, and ſurely the man who could deſpiſe a heart for its ſincerity, deſerves not to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs ſo invaluable a bleſſing. May Miſs How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard never learn to diſguiſe feelings which, chaſtened as they are, by honour and femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine delicacy, become an honour to the heart; but ſtill I muſt chide. What could you think, when you ſay, "if the union is not equally eligible with one, as it would have been with four thouſand pounds." Unkind Meriel, do you ſuppoſe millions could increaſe my love, or could they make
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:029439_0149_0FE112B3C5FD5340"/>
you more valuable. No, they could not; therefore, diſpoſe of your fortune in any manner you ſhall think fit, give me only yourſelf, and I ſhall think I poſſeſs a jewel, which worlds could not purchaſe.</p>
                     <p>I am every day expecting orders to join the fleet. Will you, my dear Miſs Howard, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my impatience, if I wiſh to call you mine before theſe orders arrive. I ſhall have a thouſand doubts and fears if I leave you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are irrevocably united. Perhaps ſome one more worthy; Oh! forgive my ſuſpicions, but who can love and not fear to loſe the object of their fondeſt hopes. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks could I once call you mine, the thought would inſpire me with courage. Should I be called into action againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of my country, honour, ambition, thirſt of fame ſhould all give way to love. For you alone would I fight, for your ſake alone wiſh to conquer, and your love ſhould be the reward of all my toils.</p>
                     <p>I will ſpend an hour with you to-morrow evening. Oh! my ſweet friend, let your mild eyes tell me, at meeting, you cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the ardent prayer of your ever faithful</p>

                     <p>BUT I did refuſe him, Celia, tho' my little rebellious heart would have fain played the traitor. Be ſtill little fool, ſaid I, Meriel will learn to be thy miſtreſs: think not, by thy flutterings and throbings, to counteract reſolutions which reaſon tells me are right and laudable. So, my dear girl, I perſevered in the determination of not giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rainsforth my hand, till the ſummer's cruiſe was over, and he was obliged to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit with as good a grace as he could, tho' I aſſure you, he looked quite blank upon it. And now, my dear girl, I will give you my reaſons for thus obſtinately oppoſing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed union. You know I ſhall be eighteen in September, when being miſtreſs of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, I may diſpoſe of it as I have already deſigned, without being anſwerable to any one. Now, if I marry firſt, I certainly make my huſband maſter, not only of myſelf, but
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:029439_0151_0FE112C64812F0B8"/>
of all I poſſeſs; and how do I know what ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections may ariſe on his part in the courſe of a few months. I do not mean, that I doubt Rainsforth's generoſity; but a change of circumſtances produces a change of ideas, and I think it is beſt not to truſt too much to the firmneſs of our own hearts.</p>
                     <p>My aunt laughed the other day, and ſaid ſhe queſtioned if I ſhould ever be married, for abſence and ſalt water are in general a cure for love. It may prove ſo with ſome, but I do not much fear the conſtancy of a man who braves even the ſhaft of ridicule, by openly avowing me the woman of his choice; for I can ſee many a ſneering ſmile, glance from my aunt to her ſon, whenever they are witneſs to his attention to your Meriel. My father and mother ſeem totally regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, whether I am married now, or when he returns; and I believe, if the truth was known, and very little concerned about my future welfare. But yet, Celia, my boſom cannot forget its natural affections, or diveſt itſelf of thoſe ſtrong ſenſations of duty, love and veneration, which ever have warmed it, ſince my infant tongue firſt liſp'd the tender name of mother. As to my father, I cannot ſay I feel any emotions in his favour, nor can it be expected I ſhould, after the ſcenes which I have imparted to you, the horrors
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:029439_0152_0FE112CCCFE15E60"/>
of which will never be removed from my mind. Alas! they often recur to my ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and caſt a gloom over every riſing pleaſure. Yet, as a man whoſe happineſs is nearly connected with my mother's; as the man whom nature requires me to regard, I will pay him every neceſſary reſpect, and as ſar as the narrow limits of my power will permit, will promote his intereſt and felicity.</p>

I feel there are moments when all the fortitude, we boaſt, ſinks into nothing oppoſed to the ſtruggles of nature; would you believe it, at the moment when I ſaw him ſtep into the chaiſe, I would have given worlds, had I poſſeſſed them, to have been his wife, that I might have gone with him, beheld him to the very laſt moment of embarkation, and even then have ſtood on the ſhore to catch a laſt look at the expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſails which bore him from me, till by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees they leſſened to my view, and at length were loſt in the vaſt horizon.</p>
                     <p>My aunt and couſins where with us drinking tea; Rainsforth came in, when I inſtantly ſaw ſomething was the matter. The order is at length arrived, ſaid I, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:029439_0153_0FE112D0A93F2888"/>
and he comes to bid me adieu; I hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a cup of tea, he put it to his lips but did not taſte it. "I am come Miſs Howard," ſaid he, "to take my leave; the fleet ſails in a few days." "Do you go this evening," ſaid my mother. "In a few moments, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam," ſaid he, "I juſt recieved the letter, and accidently met with two brother officers, who were going in a chaiſe, and gladly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted me as a third; we mean to take two ſtages to night, and ſhall be in Portſmouth by to-morrow noon." At that moment the chaiſe ſtopped at the door. Rainsforth roſe, bowed to my aunt and couſins, thanked them for all civilities, wiſhed my father and mother health, and then turned toward me. My heart was full, ſo was his; we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us ſpoke; he preſſed my hands to his lips, bowed low to hide his emotions, and was in the chaiſe in an inſtant. I knew ſenſibility would be deemed weakneſs by thoſe who were witneſs to our parting; I therefore ſtruggled to ſuppreſs my riſing tears, offered up a ſilent prayer for his ſafe return, and endeavoured at a look of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, that was very foreign to my heart.</p>
                     <p>What may be his fate, heaven alone can tell; yet ſure if worth is its peculiar care, he will not only be protected in this, but in every other danger. But alas! Celia, how
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:029439_0154_0FE112D6C6C206B8"/>
often do we ſee merit cut off in its full prime, whilſt the unworthy are ſpared.</p>
                     <p>Surely, when the brave and good fall in their country's cauſe, it muſt be that their virtues merit ſuch rewards as only heaven can give. They are ſuffered to appear on the vaſt theatre of life, to act a little while bright ſhining parts, and then are called home to receive the glorious mead of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and unceaſing joys. My mind dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this ſubject the other evening, (you know I am fond of indulging in little effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of poetry,) and painting to myſelf the ſituation of a ſoldier's wife, who has follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her huſband to the very ſcene of battle, and in the morn, ſending him forth to brave the hoſtile foe, at night ſees him covered with wounds and in the agonies of death; I for a moment fancied myſelf in her ſituation, and wrote the following trifle. I ſend it to my Celia without an apology, becauſe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles become valuable when they proceed from the friend we love.</p>

                     <p>THIS brother of mine is a ſad lad. He will not be content to remain where he has been placed, but has taken it into his wiſe head that he muſt go to ſea; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe will ſuit him, he cannot, he ſays, be confined to the drudgery of a counting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, where a perſon may toil all their lives and riſe to nothing above mediocrity. He will go to ſea, where, with one bold puſh, it often happens that a man gains both honour and fortune. The lad ſeems to be poſſeſſed of the ſpirit of ambition, yet not that lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ambition which acts as a ſtimulus to actions great and praiſe worthy. It is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wealth he aims at, and be the ſteps ever ſo dirty, by which he muſt arrive at the deſired eminence, I much fear he would not heſitate to wade thro' thick and thin.
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:029439_0158_0FE112E85CDE8C78"/>
However, as that is his fixed determination, I muſt e'en be content with the loſs of the apprentice fee, tho' here is a freſh ſource of expenſe in fitting him out as a midſhipman, for in that ſituation I find he can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on board the ſhip where Rainsforth is lieutenant. I wiſh to my ſoul an intimate acquaintance with this worthy man, may be of ſervice to him, for we often inſenſibly imbibe the ſentiments of thoſe with whom we aſſociate.</p>
                     <p>My father, I fear, is running into his old errors; he has formed an acquaintance with a Mr. Dell, which in my opinion bodes no good. Dell appears much of the gentleman in his manner, but young Moſſop ſays he is a profeſſed gambler, and I am rather inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to believe this aſſertion, as my father is frequently out with him till three or four in the morning, and has drained us ſo of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that we have not a ſingle guinea for houſe expences; this will occaſion our get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into debt, and I am afraid my father has already borrowed money on the ſtrength of my promiſe, in regard to my fortune; if ſo all my endeavours to preſerve my mother from want will be ineffectual. This Dell has a wife, whom he once brought to ſpend an afternoon with us; I do not like her; there was ſomething in her dreſs and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:029439_0159_0FE112EDE7167458"/>
bold, forward and diſguſting; ſhe has been pretty, and is vain enough to think ſhe is ſo now. My mother does not admire her any more than myſelf, and only that ſhe thinks it would highly diſoblige my father, ſhe would by no means either recieve or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn her viſits.</p>
                     <p>Another ſource of unhappineſs to this dear ſuffering woman is my father's giving way to a habit of drinking, for he is almoſt continually intoxicated, and ſo extremely captious and ill natured that it is next to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſay or do any thing to pleaſe him. Poor dear mother how my heart bleeds for your afflictions; how many years have you paſt wherein you can ſcarcely ſay, you have ſeen one happy hour; and could I, but lead you to repoſe your ſorrows on the boſom of your child! but no, you think that child unworthy of your love, unworthy your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence; and ſhe dares not clear herſelf, leſt by endeavouring to remove one ſorrow from your heart, ſhe ſhould throw another on it that would cruſh you with its weight.</p>
                     <p>I have heard from Rainsforth but once ſince the fleet ſailed. Oh! Celia, ſhould he one day afflict my heart, by harſhneſs, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty or infidelity; ah! my friend, if the thought thus wrings my boſom, what would
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:029439_0160_0FE112F35AE4B078"/>
the reality do; and yet, I would endeavour to bear it with the meekneſs of a wife, and the fortitude of a chriſtian; but me thinks I would wiſh to ſink at once under the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful certainty; doubt and ſuſpicion would torture me to the very utmoſt of my ſtrength to bear, but to be convinced I had out lived his affection, muſt, I am convinced, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant death or madneſs.</p>
                     <p>My letters have now nothing intereſting in them; Indeed, Celia, I begin to think every thing inſipid and tireſome, that is not concerning Rainsforth; even reading no more amuſes. If I read of a worthy charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſuch a one I cry is my Frederic; then I drop the book to muſe upon his virtues, and if I take up my pen I can write but an invocation to heaven for his ſafety. The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relief I find is in conſtant employment, and therefore, I ſeldom paſs an idle hour, my needle, my pencil, and my domeſtic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, pleaſingly variegate the ſcene, and prevent my complaining of laſſitude. I go out but little, and ſee but few viſitors, my couſins indeed frequently call, but as I do not mix in the ſame gay circles they do, I can join but little in their converſation; they tell me many lively anecdotes that amuſe me; I liſten to their account of a ball, a concert, or any other faſhionable amuſement

were animated the by ſame ſpark of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual fire, and tho' we cannot claim a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er tie, we ſhall be friends to the lateſt hour of our exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>My generous, noble friend, I do not bluſh to ſay my eſteem, (nay call it love, if you will) is increaſed by this proof of your mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity; call it not a reſignation, I am your's I will never be another's; unleſs I can find one your ſuperior in every virtue, that can exalt and dignify human nature, and in ſaying that, I think I am irrevocably bound to you. There may be men who poſſeſs equal goodneſs of heart, but there can be none who can boaſt a ſuperiority.</p>
                     <p>I am ſenſibly affected at your father's miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; would to heaven it was in my power to remove every affliction far from him. Not ſo much from the idea that his troubles have interrupted my happineſs; but that I am certain your feeling heart ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers thoſe misfortunes doubly, in ſeeing them inflicted on one ſo deſervedly dear to you. But let us look forward my friend; the proſpect is not ſo dark, but that the ſun of proſperity may yet brake forth to enliven it; you may yet live to ſee your father reinſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the afluence, from which he is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent removed by an all-wiſe Providence, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:029439_0167_0FE11312A4CC0B40"/>
to teach him the value of paſt bleſſings. We never know rightly, how to prize a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, till we have known what it is to loſe it; I write feelingly Rainsforth, for, I knew not half your worth till the very moment that I ſaw an inſuperable barrier placed between us, and now I wiſh I had liſtened to your ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for then at this moment I might have adminiſtered comfort to your drooping ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and aſſiſted in the delightful taſk of ſoothing the ſorrows of your parents. But why ſhould I be ſo ſelfiſh, the pleaſure would have been all my own; for ſure I knew your generous heart too well, to ſuppoſe it would not have ſuffered from the idea of my ſharing in afflictions, which could not have been prevented, and hardly admit of any aleviation. To ſay I felt nothing when I read your pathetic letter, would be to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce myſelf inſenſible. Believe me, I felt all; nay, perhaps more than you could have wiſhed; however, of this be aſſured, that nothing but a total change in you can occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any alteration in my ſentiments. If it will be more conducive to your happineſs; here let the correſpondence ceaſe, and ſhould you hereafter meet a woman, whoſe merits and fortune render her worthy your attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; may you be as happy in the union
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:029439_0168_0FE113184EA1C9E0"/>
as the lot of mortallity will allow. Adieu, every kind wiſh of my heart is your's.</p>

                     <p>IT is in vain to ſtrive againſt fate. My father is reſolved not to pauſe in his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer of folly, till we are all involved in ruin.
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:029439_0169_0FE1131BF784E018"/>
The money I preſented to my mother, when I took poſſeſſion of my fortune, is all mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered away, and even the little capital I had reſerved for myfelf, broke in upon. I know you will ſay I am purſuing my notions of filial duty now to imprudence; I fear I am, and yet, my dear Celia, were you ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated as I am, I ſo well know your heart, that I am certain you would have conducted yourſelf exactly in the ſame manner.</p>
                     <p>About three days ſince, a gentleman cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and preſented a bill for payment, drawn by my brother, who had given my mother notice of his deſign; but ſhe, fearful of mentioning it, as ſhe had no means of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the demand, had kept it to herſelf. It was for an hundred pounds. Ungenerous lad! when he knew how narrow our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were, and how much his inconſiſtent conduct had embarraſſed us. When the man brought the bill, my poor mother turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pale as aſhes. "What is the matter, madam," ſaid I. She called me into the next room, and putting the bill into my hand, (for it was ſome days after ſight) ſhe ſaid, "what muſt I do." "Indeed my dear madam," I replied, "I cannot tell. It is not in my power to do any more, the bill muſt be proteſted, and I hope it will teach him frugality in future. I am ſure he muſt
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:029439_0170_0FE1132145AC8F78"/>
have been very extravagant, or he never could have wanted money ſo ſoon, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſum he took with him." She made me no anſwer, but burſting into tears cried, "then all is over, my poor Richard." I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can ſee my mother in affliction, but my heart yearns ſpontaniouſly to fly to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. How then could I behold her tears unmoved, how hold back that comfort ſhe required, when ſhe thus continued to addreſs me. "I know, Meriel, we have almoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced you to beggary, I am fully ſenſible how much we owe to your generoſity." "Dear, dear mother, talk not ſo," ſaid I, throwing my arms about her, "I have done nothing but my duty, and I think it ſtill my duty to preſerve the remainder of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, to comfort you in your declining age." "But think of your brother, Meriel," cried ſhe eagerly, "think my dear girl, what ſtraits he may reduced to in a foreign land. If this bill is not paid, my poor boy will be thrown into priſon, and be loſt for want of a friend to comfort him. Oh! Meriel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe not your mother this one requeſt." And ah! my Celia, may I never meet ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trial. The dear woman knelt; yes, my mother knelt to me before I had the time or power to prevent her. "Good heavens!" ſaid I, "this is too much, take me, dear mother, do with me and mine as
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:029439_0171_0FE113253B19A380"/>
you think proper, only I beſeech you do not let me be thus humiliated. 'Tis I ſhould have knelt to you, oh! riſe, and do not thus diſtreſs me. I will pay the bill."</p>
                     <p>The next day I took up money ſufficient for that purpoſe, and alſo to diſcharge ſome few debts in the neighbourhood, ſo that our income is now ſo reduced that I muſt be obliged to turn my thoughts towards ſome genteel employment, however repugnant it is to my father and mother's inclinations. In my opinion, the perſon who has talents, health and ſpirits to earn a ſubſiſtence, is in all reſpects independent, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to me would be more painful, than to eat the bread of indolence. Pride may teach another leſſon, but then it is not the pride which elevates the human heart. It ſhall be ever my pride to keep free from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation. It is always a painful ſenſe, but more eſpecially when we have no power to return it. Let my habitation be ever ſo humble, and my fare ever ſo coarſe, if they are the fruits of my own induſtry, they will be ſweeter, more comfortable by far, than the greateſt luxuries purchaſed by the cringe of ſervility.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE expected morning after morning with hope, and each day as it arrived brought with it only diſappointment. I will decieve myſelf no longer, nothing but death, or extreme illneſs could have kept him from me, tho' I have been told that he meant from the firſt to decieve me, and that my eaſy fondneſs has been a theme for ridcule for him and his gay companions. But I cannot believe it, Celia, if he is falſe, where ſhall we find a man worthy to be eſteemed. No, Rainsforth, there certainly muſt be ſome very urgent cauſe for this abſence, this, I had almoſt ſaid, cruel ſilence; but I will not give up the opinion I have formed of your integrity.</p>

                     <p>My couſin Heſter called on me yeſterday to take a walk; we called on a lady of her acquaintance who has a ſiſter married at Plymouth, for Heſter ſuggeſted that through her means we might gain ſome intelligence concerning Rainsforth. After the uſual ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, when we were ſeated, Heſter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired when ſhe had heard from her ſiſter, "I had a letter yeſterday," ſhe replied, "Kitty has been very gay, I aſſure you, they have had great doings at Plymouth, Miſs Kingly, the great heireſs, was married laſt Monday, and Kitty was at the wedding." "And pray who is ſhe married to?" ſaid Heſter. "A young officer in the navy," ſhe replied, "whom ſhe has been fond of for ſome time; I really forget his name, but there is the letter, you may read the whole account."</p>
                     <p>I do not know how I ſupported my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, while I caſt my eye over the letter, as my couſin held it in her hand, but I caught the name of Rainsforth; my head grew giddy, I turned cold and faint; but by the exertion of my reſolution avoided making myſelf ridiculous. "Upon my word," cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:029439_0176_0FE1133DFB0A70E0"/>
ſaid Heſter without any regard to my feelings, in expoſing me to a ſtranger, "up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my word, this is very unaccountable." "Why pray," ſaid the lady, "is it the Mr. Rainsforth I have ſeen ſo often with you Miſs Moſſop?" "The very ſame, and will you believe it, he was under a promiſe of marriage to my couſin here; do you not think it very ſcandalous behaviour?" "Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous indeed: if I was in Miſs Howard's place I would ſue him for half his wife's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall not give either myſelf or him that trouble, madam, (I replied with as much compoſure as I could aſſume,) I think ſince he has proved himſelf of ſo fickle a nature, he has done me a favour rather than an injury, as it would have been much more painful to me to loſe the affection of a huſband than a lover. Pride my dear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam added I with a forced ſmile) keeps up our ſpirits on theſe occaſions."</p>
                     <p>I returned home from this viſit with a heavy heart, but ſtill flattered myſelf there might be ſome miſtake; but the receipt of the letter I incloſe for your peruſal has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved every doubt.</p>

                     <p>I begin to be more compoſed; I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to deſpiſe the whole ſex; they may wear a ſemblance of virtue, but the reality of it is foreign to their hearts. Every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of life will be now equally indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to me; I have vowed to devote myſelf to my mother while ſhe lives, and whenever heaven pleaſes to call her away, my inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant prayer ſhall be ſoon to follow; I do not wiſh to go before her, becauſe, I ſee her only hope of ſupport muſt proceed from me; and unboundedly grateful will be my heart, if by any means whatever I can preſerve her from miſery.</p>

                     <p>It was certainly a wiſe diſpenſation of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that prevented my union with Rainsforth; had I been ſeparated from my dear mother, where now would ſhe have found a comforter. My father is in priſon Celia; my whole fortune is expended; but thank heaven, I have ſtill health and ſtrength to work. I live in a miſerable apartment in the Fleet priſon, I ſit loſt as it were to every thing but miſery; but yet, my dear Celia, I can look up to heaven with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; I am not a wife, I am not a mother, I feel not the ſtrong chords of maternal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

twining round my heart, and wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with unutterable anguiſh; I might have been more wretched than I am: and whilſt I can ſay that, let me expreſs only gratitude towards the great Ruler of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, who has not tried me beyond my ſtrength to ſupport. Can you think, my friend, that in this miſerable ſituation I have yet one ray of comfort breaks on my benight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoul; yes, Celia, I have: my dear mother is at length convinced, that my love, my duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attentions, are the reſult of the feelings of my heart. On me alone ſhe now reſts; to me alone looks for comfort; her eyes once more beam on me with affection; her heart again is lift up to heaven for my felicity; and who my dear friend, who that knows the juſt value of maternal love, would not gladly reſign wealth, nay almoſt every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, to enjoy ſo ineſtimable a bleſſing.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE now ſat down, to give you the particulars of a ſcene, which, when I laſt wrote, I could not command ſufficient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure to deleniate. I had been out one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon on particular buſineſs; indeed to look after ſome employment, whereby I might conduce to the ſupport of the family. On my return I found my mother weeping
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029439_0184_0FE1135DA7043090"/>
over a bit of paper, which ſhe held in her hand. I enquired the cauſe. She gave me the paper, and I read on it, "Barwell, She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff's officer, Carey-ſtreet." "Your father is arreſted, Meriel," ſaid ſhe. "Gracious heaven!" ſaid I, "then we are all ruined: but what is the ſum; at whoſe ſuit is he arreſted." "At the ſuit of that villain Dell," ſhe replied, "for fifty pounds, which he has lent him; no doubt at the gaming table; he alſo threatens him with a proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for a criminal correſpondence with his wife. Oh heavens!" continued ſhe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling her tears, "when ſhall I die and be at peace." It was in vain to offer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. I did not even attempt it, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, if poſſible, to ſee if any thing could be done, either to ward off the impending blow, or to extricate us from the difficulties attending it. I went immediately to an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney, made him acquainted with the caſe, and requeſted his advice. He told me there was no redreſs, that the money muſt be paid, and in caſe of the proſecution, it was moſt likely he would be caſt with damages. This intelligence was an additional weight upon my ſpirits. However, I proceeded to Carey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, where I found this thoughtleſs father ſurrounded by unfortunate men of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt claſs, with a bowl of punch before him, and in the very act of ſinging a drinking
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:029439_0185_0FE113636A7D6160"/>
ſong. When he ſaw me, he looked abaſhed. I aſked if I coud ſpeak to him in another room, for my ſoul ſhrunk from the ſociety of thoſe unhappy beings, with whom he ſeemed ſo pleaſed. When we were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with another apartment, I aſked him, how this debt was contracted, and by what means he meant to diſcharge it. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not repeat to you the anſwer he made; it was ſo replete with contradiction, that I had ſcarcely patience to hear him out. When he had finiſhed, I enquired, if that debt was paid, were there no others of the ſame ſort. "Conſider ſir," ſaid I, "it will not be long I ſhall have it in my power to anſwer theſe demands, and when my money is entirely expended, where is my dear mother to find ſupport." "Ah Meriel," ſaid he, "you are always more anxious about her than me, you don't care what becomes of your father." "I ſhould think, ſir," ſaid I with ſome warmth, "that I had given ſufficient proof of my attention to the happineſs of both. I am ſorry to uſe any language to a father, which may be deemed improper; but I muſt ſay, had you paid as much attention to your own happineſs as was undoubtedly your duty, many of the afflictions, if not all which have fallen upon our family, might have been avoided. I will pay this money ſir, and I hope you will not think I take too
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:029439_0186_0FE11366737E82A8"/>
great a liberty if I adviſe you, hereafter to ſhun ſuch unworthy acquaintance as Dell, and ſtrive rather to obtain ſome genteel em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, by which theſe kind of ſcenes may in future be avoided.</p>
                     <p>"You talk like a very unfeeling girl, Meriel," ſaid he. "Do you imagine then it is ſo eaſy for a man, born and brought up a gentleman, to ſubmit to the drudgery of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude: no Miſs; if your ideas are ſo mean, mine are not, I will ſtarve firſt, and would rather ſee you ſtarve than have my family diſgraced by your following any ſervile, mean employment." Believe me, Celia, when he uttered theſe ſentiments, I felt ſo irritated by his fooliſh pride, that had not the idea of my ſuffering mother at that moment obtruded on my mind, I ſhould have left him to his fate. However, I ſtifled my riſing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and having given him a draught on my banker to diſcharge the arreſt, returned to conſole my mother. When I entered, I was ſurpriſed to ſee her grief more violent than ever. She was wringing her hands and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with great bitterneſs. After many fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs enquiries concerning this freſh torrent of ſorrow, I learnt that Mr. Leſage, the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, with whom I had placed the trifling rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of my fortune, was declared a bankrupt. To deſcribe my feelings is impoſſible. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029439_0187_0FE1136BAEABE040"/>
I ſaw my mother wanted comfort, and I exerted my utmoſt power to ſtifle emotions, which if indulged, would only ſerve to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe her anguiſh.</p>
                     <p>"We muſt go to priſon," ſaid ſhe, "we muſt all go to priſon, and who is to ſupport us there?" "Providence, my dear mother," ſaid I, "We will place our hopes on that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign power, who never forſakes thoſe, who, in full confidence of ſupport, exert their utmoſt abilities and rely on him only for ſucceſs. Come, come, chear up, thank God, I am healthy and able to work." She gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on me for a moment; then throwing her arms round me, ſhe cried, "oh! my child, I will doubt your virtue no longer; your heart muſt be pure, or you could not thus rely on heaven for ſupport; but oh! my dear Meriel, it will wound my heart ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely to ſee you obliged to labour for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence." "Do not think of it," ſaid I; "let me ſee you but tolerably happy and I ſhall not regret any hardſhip, however ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere: I will never leave you, my beloved mother; only let me be once more called the child of your affection, and I ſhall think myſelf completely rewarded for every ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it may pleaſe heaven to inflict." A few days after this, my father was removed to this miſerable place: we ſold the beſt part
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:029439_0188_0FE11371444093C8"/>
of our furniture and cloaths to diſcharge the debts owing among our trades people. My mother then came to my father: I do not ſleep in the priſon, but come here every morning; I perform all their domeſtic of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, go out for their proviſion, &amp;c. but as yet, have not been able to procure any work. Indeed, I had hope of being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by an embroiderer, but on being aſked to give ſecurity, for the ſafety of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever work I might be entruſted with; I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately happened to mention, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to Mr. Moſſop's family; of courſe, the maſter of the ſhop applied to my aunt for my character. Celia, this aunt denied any knowledge of me, ſaid ſhe had no relation who was in circumſtances to want employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that kind, that ſhe had ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a young woman of the name of Howard, ſhe believed, I might be very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt but I was certainly no relation of her's.</p>
                     <p>Thus my dear girl, was my laudable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign fruſtrated; for the man naturally enough obſerved if I could be guilty of tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a lie; I might be capable of worſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I hope, however, in a ſhort time to procure ſomething to do; for our little ſtock of money diminiſhes very faſt.</p>

                        <hi>Auguſt</hi> 15<hi>th,</hi> 1778.</p>
                     <p>Of all the ſcenes through which we are doomed to paſs, ſure none is ſo truly pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as that of being witneſs to the death of thoſe whom nature has placed in a near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to us; whom, ſpite of all their errors, we cannot wholly diveſt our hearts of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for; and to ſee them approach the awful confines of eternity in a frame of mind, that renders all offered comfort ineffectual, to calm their doubts and fears, when the retroſpect of their paſt lives fills them only with horror; and the idea of futurity brings nothing but deſpair. Such a ſcene I have lately paſt; my father is no more: he is I hope at peace; to think otherwiſe would be an agony too great to bear: poor man, to the very laſt he was addicted to the fatal errors that had undone him. Few were the hours he ſpent in the apartment with my mother, being chiefly at a place, which they call the tap, where he could drown his care, as he vainly imagined, and where he was frequently drawn in to play cards, tho' ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the laſt ſix-pence he had in his pocket.</p>
                     <p>One evening, at this place he quarrelled with his antagoniſt, and high words enſued; from words they went to blows, and my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:029439_0190_0FE1137A7B2E6400"/>
recieved a ſtroke on his temple, which leveled him with the ground. He fell with the back of his head againſt an iron fender which cut him ſeverely and fractured the ſkull; all aſſiſtance was vain; he languiſhed four days, in all the complicated agonies of pain of body and diſtreſs of mind; tho' I flatter myſelf he had ſome internal comfort in his laſt moments, as he ſeemed more compoſed for about two hours before his death. He earneſtly requeſted forgiveneſs of both my mother and myſelf, for the manifold injuries he had done us; but to my great comfort, mentioned no particulars: he alſo made a declaration before witneſſes that the man who ſtruck the unfortunate blow, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely guiltleſs of intentional malice, as he had been the firſt aggreſſor himſelf; and the fall was entirely accidental. He expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a wiſh to ſee his ſiſter; in compliance with his earneſt deſire I went to her, told her of the melancholy accident, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requeſted ſhe would viſit my dying father.</p>
                     <p>"Upon my word Meriel," ſaid ſhe, "I am extremely ſorry for this ſhocking affair; but you know child my ſeeing him will be of no uſe; it will only be hurting my own feelings, with out being of the leaſt ſervice to your father. I never can bear ſcenes of this kind; my ſenſibility is ſo exquiſite, that, was I to ſee my poor brother in this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:029439_0191_0FE11380465DAB50"/>
I ſhould not recover it for a month. Ah! poor man, he was always getting into ſome miſchief or other; he never proſpered in any thing after his marriage with your mother."</p>
                     <p>"You cannot ſuppoſe, madam, that the want of proſperity was to be attributed to that union."</p>
                     <p>"Why, I don't know, Meriel, my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther never loved your mother, but was art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully drawn in." "By whom, madam?" "By your grand mother, Miſs, who wiſhed to get a good ſettlement for her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Your mother too, pretended ſuch a violent affection for him, that he could not refuſe ſome little return of kindneſs, and they never ceaſed their arts till they had nooſed him faſt."</p>
                     <p>"You talk in riddles, madam, my mother brought my father a genteel fortune."</p>
                     <p>"It was nothing, Miſs, to the fortune he might have expected, if he had not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended his father; I always ſaid no good would come of the match." "It is much to be wiſhed, indeed, madam," ſaid I, "that ſuch a union never had taken place; it would have ſpared my dear mother many
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029439_0192_0FE11385F416A7E0"/>
years of ſevere anguiſh, and my unfortunate ſelf would never have ſeen the light." As I ſaid this my heart was ſo oppreſſed I could not refrain my tears. "Bleſs me! my dear," ſaid Mrs. Moſſop, in an affected accent of kindneſs; "I did not mean to vex you, you are not to be blamed for your parents faults."</p>
                     <p>"If they have faults, madam," ſaid I, "be aſſured I wiſh not to hear of them, it would be a painful topic at any time, but pardon me, if I ſay, at this particular ſeaſon, it is a cruel one. I come to intreat you to viſit a brother, who is poor and dying in priſon. I ſhould think, had he millions of faults, at this moment they would be all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; that you would remember only his afflictions, and that he was your brother." I ſpoke this with ſome warmth; my aunt heſitated for an anſwer; at length ſhe told me ſhe would come the next morning. "It will be too late, madam," ſaid I, "it is thought he cannot live the night out." "Dear, dear," ſhe replied, "it is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate that I have a large party coming this afternoon, but if they leave me in any tolerable ſeaſon"—I would hear no more, but turning from her with a mixture of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and pity, I returned to the habitation of mourning and death. When I entered
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:029439_0193_0FE1138B9FEB3FD8"/>
the room, my father enquired eagerly if ſhe would come; I thought it would be wrong to diſturb his laſt moments, with an account of her unfeeling conduct, I therefore only told him, ſhe was not able to come that evening, but would be there early in the morning. "It will be too late then," ſaid he, "I muſt write to her." It was in vain we remonſtrated; he would be raiſed in the bed, with a deſign to write; but his head would not permit him to trace even a ſingle letter: he was ſeized with faintings and when he recovered ſeemed to have forgot his deſign. He ſpoke but little afterwards, was wholly taken up in prayer: tho' he frequently cried out in agony, "'tis all in vain, I cannot be forgiven." A worthy well diſpoſed clergyman prayed beſided him, and ſaid a great deal to compoſe him, and calm his doubts. It had in ſome meaſure the deſired effect: and about four o'clock in the morning, he reſigned his ſoul into the hand of Him who gave it.</p>
                     <p>My mother's ſorrow is not to be deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. All thought of our dreadful, deſolate ſituation was entirely abſorbed in this heavy affliction. I did not attempt to interrupt her grief, as I thought, if ſuffered to take its natural courſe, time would meliorate a ſorrow, which, any attempt at preſent to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:029439_0194_0FE11390546EB680"/>
ſoften, would but increaſe. In the courſe of the next day, we expected my aunt to make the promiſed viſit; but as the day paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed without ſeeing her, in the evening my mother deſired me to go to her again, and inform him of our loſs. I went, but was ſuffered to wait near an hour, before ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; nor did my couſins come near me, tho' I heard them laughing and talking in the next room. Ah! ſaid I, mentally, the afflicted are never admitted chearfully; they are left to indulge their own ſad thoughts in ſolitude. Cruel Heſter and Suſan, had you been in affliction, would not I have abridged my own pleaſures to comfort and conſole you. When my aunt entered the room ſhe began; "realy Meriel I have not been able to viſit my brother before; but now I have half an hour to ſpare, I will ſend for a coach, and we will go together." "Your viſit will no doubt be acceptable to my mother, dear madam," ſaid I, "but my father is no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in a ſituation."—</p>
                     <p>"He is dead then," cried ſhe eagerly.</p>
                     <p>I bowed my head in ſilence.</p>
                     <p>"Well," continued ſhe, "I rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it, and I am much obliged to you for calling, to let me know, as I ſhould have
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:029439_0195_0FE11395E2E384C0"/>
been greatly ſhocked to have found him dead, when I had called, as I certainly ſhould, either this evening or to-morow morning."</p>
                     <p>"My mother bid me aſk your advice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the funeral madam, and not only your advice, but your aſſiſtance."</p>
                     <p>"Aſſiſtance, for what child?"</p>
                     <p>"Could you advance us a little money?"</p>
                     <p>"Money, Miſs Howard! You aſtoniſh me; it is impoſſible you can be in want of money, when you came to poſſeſſion of ſo handſome a fortune within theſe two years."</p>
                     <p>"I am very ſorry madam, that you can ſuppoſe me capable of ſuffering my parents to languiſh in priſon for fifty pounds, if I could have commanded ſuch a ſum."</p>
                     <p>"Why as to that Meriel, I thought you were acting like a prudent girl, and meant to take care of yourſelf; for I know you paid a great deal of money for your father, and might have continued ſo doing till you had ruined yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="unknown:029439_0196_0FE11398A19BFD18"/>
"I ſhould certainly have paid this laſt debt, madam, had not the failure of Mr. Leſage put it entirely out of my power."</p>
                     <p>"Oh I remember hearing, that you loſt ſix hundred pounds by his failure, but you ſurely had a larger ſum by you than that."</p>
                     <p>"Indeed aunt, that ſix hundred pounds was all the dependence I had in the world."</p>
                     <p>"Upon my word Meriel, I never was more aſtoniſhed in my life. How have you contrived to run thro' all that money. Your mother and yourſelf muſt have been very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, and when that is the caſe, nothing will ſave people from ruin. I am very ſorry child, very ſorry; but it is not in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to help you; I have a large family, and the education of my daughters is expenſive. As to my poor brother, why, my advice is, that you have him buried as privately, and with as little expenſe as poſſible. You will remember me to your mother; tell her I am réally concerned at her trouble; but it is entirely out my power to help her, nor indeed, do I think it would be of any uſe; for was ſhe releived from theſe difficulties, ſhe would ſoon be involved by her impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in others of the ſame ſort."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="unknown:029439_0197_0FE113A389A79A78"/>
When I repeated this converſation to my mother, ſhe ſaid, "it is no more than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, my dear child; but I let you go to make trial of her heart, that you might be convinced, how little depedence is to be placed on profeſſions of friendſhip, made to us in our proſperity; and how little aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is to be hoped from relations. We will ſell every valuable of our cloaths and plate, to lay your father decently in the ground, and to pay the debt for which I now am become liable. It will, I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, leave us almoſt deſtitute; but when we have our liberty, we can perhaps gain employment of ſome kind or other, I will not mind how abject; for I would rather hardly earn, or indeed beg my bread from ſtrangers, than be ſubject to the unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of haughty, unfeeling relations."</p>
                     <p>This reſolution was immediately execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and when all expences were diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we found ourſelves poſſeſſed of five guineas, ſome trifling houſehold furniture, and the meaneſt of our cloaths. With theſe we left that abode of miſery, the Fleet pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and have taken a cheap lodging, on the Surry ſide of Black friars bridge. I have endeavoured to get ſome work, but as yet without effect; and what adds to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, is, that my dear mother's health
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:029439_0198_0FE1139EB0911B00"/>
daily declines. As I have no other amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſpend a good deal of time at my pen. I have wrote ſeveral little poems, which I intend to correct and offer to ſome bookſeller. Perhaps by that means, I may obtain ſomething towards our ſubſiſtance. I feel a tranſient ray of hope dawn upon my mind. My mother ſmiling, tells me, I am too ſanguine; but my dear Celia, I always was inclined to take the brighteſt ſide of the proſpect, to hope for the beſt, and when diſappointment arrives, to ſubmit with as much patience as I can. I am what is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally termed a caſtle builder; it is a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (if it deſerves the appellation) from which I derive amuſement at leaſt, and tho' I know at the very moment I am indulging thoſe ſanguine ideas, that my hopes have no more foundation, than the bubble blown from the pipe of a playful boy; yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help being pleaſed with the airy fabric of my own creating, and as ſoon as one va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes, (to continue the alluſion) I puff out another, and ſo prevent myſelf from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a prey to deſpair. And, believe me Celia, I conſider this diſpoſition, as one of the choiceſt gifts of heaven. Adieu my friend; may you be happier than </p>

                     <p>IT is now ſome months ſince I have taken up my pen to addreſs my dear Celia. Several times lately I have eſſayed to do it, but unable to bear a retroſpect of my late heavy affliction, have from time to time, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the painful recital, till I begin to fear my dear friend will think I am either num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with the dead, or become forgetful of her friendſhip. I have a long tale to tell my dear girl, a tale, which I fear, will ſteal many a tear from your eyes as you peruſe it. In my laſt I informed you of my mother's ill health, and how unable we were to procure any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per advice or aſſiſtance. From that time her malady daily increaſed. I finiſhed my little collection of poems and preſented them to a bookſeller; but he told me, I had miſtaken my talents, and that the whole collection was
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:029439_0200_0FE113ACD3053B70"/>
not worth a guinea. Diſheartened and diſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted I returned to my mother, and now gave up my whole time to watching and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her. Her diſorder increaſed with ſuch rapidity, that in the courſe of a few weeks ſhe was confined to her bed. What a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect had I now before me, a beloved parent ſinking by ſlow degrees into the grave; when I had no method of procuring the comforts, and even the neceſſaries of life were denied. I had parted with all our apparel, except a change of linen, and had now paſt one whole day without food. My mother made no complaints; but her pale wan countenance, was to me a thouſand times more affecting than unavailing exclamations. Our credit had been long loſt in the neighbourhood, and I knew that in a few days we muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably periſh for want. In this ſituation, I took a reſolution to go out in the cloſe of the evening and ſolicit the charity of the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. I told my tale of ſorrow to many of my own ſex. They either heard me not, or diſbelieved my aſſertions, and after ſaunter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the ſtreets near three hours, one cold wet night in October, I at length col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected about ſix-pence, and with it having procured ſome trifling nouriſhment for my almoſt famiſhed parent, I returned, allowing myſelf only a halfpenny roll. When I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried my little morſel to her bedſide, ſhe
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:029439_0201_0FE113B207072608"/>
anxiouſly enquired how I had procured it. "Some charitable diſpoſed perſon," ſaid I, "gave me the means; take it my mother, eat and be comforted."</p>
                     <p>Sinking nature required ſupport; ſhe eat the offered morſel, but ſeaſoned it with tears of heartfelt anguiſh.</p>
                     <p>The next day I determined again to try my new employment, and for that purpoſe wandered out towards the park. It was Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, the day was fine, I went in and ſeating myſelf on a bench, looked at the gay throng that crowded the mall, compared their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with my own, and began to think my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the moſt unfortunate of human beings. I knew I had never deviated from the path of virtue; I had never committed any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deſerving ſuch abject miſery, and I ſaw many women who had forfeited all claim to honour and reſpect, enjoying all the luxuries of life. At that moment reaſon, religion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity forſook me; and I wiſhed myſelf in the ſame ſituation with thoſe victims to vice, if by ſo doing, I could procure ſuſtenance for my mother.</p>
                     <p>You will, perhaps aſk, my dear Celia, if we had no friends whatever, to whom we could apply for relief; alas! my dear girl, you
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:029439_0202_0FE113B6344F1148"/>
know nothing of the world; thoſe who have drank deep of the cup of affliction can tell, that poverty and friendſhip are utter ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to each other. While I was indulging theſe painful reflections, an elderly gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, ſeated herſelf beſide me, and view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my perſon and dreſs with a ſcrutinizing eye, began ſome trifling diſcourſe, and at length aſked me, if I was born in London. From chatting at firſt on indifferent ſubjects, we began to remark the different appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the paſſing multitude. The old lady's remarks were juſt and pertinent; her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe breathed the true ſpirit of philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. I imagined I had found a friend, and without reſerve unboſomed myſelf to her; related my ſtory of paſt and preſent diſtreſs; ſhe heard me with attention, and, me thought, I ſaw a gleam of compaſſion paſs acroſs her features. I ſeized the propitious moment, and in the humbleſt accent peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned relief.</p>
                     <p>"Poor child," ſaid ſhe, "I believe your ſtory to be true; innocence and ſimplicity, are indeliably marked upon your counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; what is in my power I will do for you, tho' the means are but ſmall." She then drew forth her purſe, and preſented me with half a crown: it is only for thoſe who have been in ſimilar circumſtances to
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:029439_0203_0FE113BBA991FBA8"/>
concieve the tide of joy that ruſhed upon my heart at the poſſeſſion of this little piece of ſilver; I eagerly kiſſed the hand that conveyed it to me, and would have ſpoke, but tears were the only thanks I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; they were the ſincereſt, for they came warm from the heart.</p>
                     <p>I left my ſeat with precipitation, and was preparing to return home; but my bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factreſs ſtopped me. "Miſs Howard," ſaid ſhe, "I believe I have it my power to ſerve you; meet me here again to-morrow." I promiſed to meet her and returned to my mother with a heart lightened of half its ſorrows. No doubt, ſaid I, this lady will endeavour to extricate us from our preſent diſtreſs, and put us in ſome way of earning future ſubſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>Elated with theſe hopes, I repaired next day to the appointed place; but after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waited two hours was obliged to return without ſeeing my benefactreſs. Something has detained her unexpectedly, ſaid I, ſhe will undoubtedly come to-morrow: but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow paſſed as yeſterday had done, and I was again diſappointed.</p>
                     <p>The third morning, tho' I had uſed the moſt rigid economy, I found myſelf again penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:029439_0204_0FE1083C210D3268"/>
However, ſpiritleſs and miſerable as I was, I determined once more to repair to the park. My pace was ſlow, my looks dejected and my eyes ſtreaming with tears. I had hardly proceeded half the length of the mall, when I heard myſelf called, and turning round perceived my benefactreſs.</p>
                     <p>"My good girl," ſaid ſhe, "I almoſt feared I ſhould not meet you, I have been obliged to go into the country ſince I ſaw you, but I had not forgot you; come dry your eyes, I have met with a gentleman who will be your friend, if you mind how you behave yourſelf. He has ſent you half a guinea; and if you will come this evening and ſup at my houſe, in Soho ſquare, I will introduce you to him."</p>
                     <p>"Alas! madam," ſaid I, "my appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at your houſe will only diſgrace you; nor can I ſuppoſe any gentleman will greatly intereſt himſelf in behalf of a poor unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate girl, without requiring a return which virtue and religion will not ſuffer me to make."</p>
                     <p>"Don't be fooliſh, child," ſaid the old lady, "virtue and religion are very pretty words; but pray tell me, will they keep your mother from ſtarving."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="30" facs="unknown:029439_0205_0FE113C61FE377A8"/>
"Oh! madam," I replied, "will it not be worſe than death to brand her name with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy? Alas! I never could bear the ſcorn of the world, and the reproofs of my own conſcience, oppreſſed with guilt and ſhame. Tempt me not, dear madam, to forſake the path of rectitude; let me retain my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and come what may, I ſhall die in peace."</p>
                     <p>"This is fine talking, Miſs Howard, but let me tell you, it is a very ſelfiſh way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing. You acknowledge, that the loſs of virtue would make you unhappy. Are you not already unhappy in a ſuperlative degree; and does that unhappineſs in the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to relieve your own or your mother's wants. No, does not the ſight of your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery rather increaſe hers? Come, then, my dear girl, act the heroine, take this load of ſorrow upon yourſelf, and ſave a parent, whom you tenderly love, from periſhing with famine."</p>
                     <p>This was a ſtrange way of arguing, Celia, yet it had the deſired effect, I thought it was poſſible to hide my infamy from my mother, and confine my miſery to my own boſom. When the old woman found my reſolution began to waver, ſhe plied me with ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal arguments, deſcribed in glowing colours
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:029439_0206_0FE113CA77F9A2B8"/>
the gaiety and ſplendor in which many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of looſe characters lived, and contraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſtrongly with my poor miſerable apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where my ſure attendants were pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold and hunger, and my only companion a beloved parent ſinking under the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated evils of ſickneſs and famine.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! ſave me! ſave me!" cried I ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly, "from the dreadful thought, teach me how to ſnatch her from impending de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, to adminiſter ſupport to her waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frame, and comfort her declining hours. Do with me as you will; ſave, protect my dear mother, and let me be the only ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice."</p>
                     <p>Having brought me to this horrible reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and recieved my promiſe of coming to her houſe in the evening; ſhe left me, and I repaired home; by the way procuring a bottle of wine and ſome other neceſſaries for my mother. She had been anxious at my long ſtay, and when I produced the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments, again enquired how I had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed them. A lie, (the firſt I had ever told her) now ſuggeſted itſelf; I ſaid I had performed a little work for a lady in the neighbourhood, and ſhe had liberally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded me; but when I mentioned going out again in the evening, the pathetic man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:029439_0207_0FE113D01A5CEE90"/>
in which ſhe intreated me to guard my honour, as my only treaſure, and as I wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preſerve her heart from breaking, almoſt ſtaggered my reſolution: but having given her ſome refreſhment, I ſaw her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits revive, and that by degrees ſhe ſunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſweet refreſhing ſlumber. I determined to ſacrifice every other conſideration rather than ſee her reduced again to the extremity of miſery ſhe had ſo lately experienced.</p>
                     <p>Oh! ye rigidly virtuous of my own ſex, turn not from me with horror and contempt, conſider my agonizing diſtreſs, glance with an eye of compaſſion over the dreadful reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and let a tear of pity blot the offence from your memories.</p>
                     <p>Great and painful were the ſtruggles of my ſoul, while gazing on my ſleeping pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. I knelt by the bedſide, and would have prayed, but, alas! that conſolation was denied me. How could I addreſs a Being of infinite purity, when I was going to offer myſelf a ſacrifice at the ſhrine of guilt and pollution. I thought I ſhould have ſunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the agonies I endured; once I wiſhed for death, but then the thought of what my poor mother would ſuffer, immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the impious deſire; at length, I claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my hands and raiſing my eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:029439_0208_0FE113D359E34DD8"/>
cried, "Father of mercy direct me, oh! give me fortitude to bear thy diſpenſations as I ought, or pardon the weakneſs of an afflicted mortal." I then kiſſed my ſleeping mother, and with a heart almoſt broken re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to Soho.</p>
                     <p>The old woman received me cordially, but reproved my penſive countenance and ſwolen eyes; ſhe made me drink ſome tea, and then taking me up ſtair<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, inſiſted on my dreſſing myſelf in a brown luteſtring night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gown, with a cap and linen ſuitable. We then went into an elegant parlour, and in a few moments Mr. Welldon was announced: he was a man upwards of thirty, of a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſon, polite addreſs, and inſinuating manner; he regarded me with viſible atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and when he ſpoke to me, it was with a mixture of reſpect and polite freedom. My feelings during ſupper were beyond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, poignant: I could ſcarcely reſtrain my tears, but the reproving looks of the old woman told me how much they would offend her: I therefore endeavoured to ſtifle my emotions; but when the cloth was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and ſhe aroſe to quit the room, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily caught her hand, and with a look which pleaded ſtrongly for compaſſion burſt into tears.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="unknown:029439_0209_0FE113D9C1817B98"/>
"Why, what does the girl cry for?" ſaid ſhe ſneeringly, "was it not by your own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you came here? come, Mr. Welldon, you muſt get the better of theſe pretty airs, tho' perhaps, indeed you may think her the more agreeable for them." Then diſengaging her hand from my graſp, ſhe left the room.</p>
                     <p>"Then I am inevitably loſt," cried I, claſping my hands in a wild agony, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling my tears. "My ſweet girl," ſaid Mr. Welldon, "this diſtreſs, which is too acute, to be conſtrued into affectation, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupriſes me. Was it not by your own free will that you came here to meet me?"</p>
                     <p>"It was, it was," ſaid I, "but oh! ſir, if you only knew the anguiſh it has coſt me, to form the horrid deſign, you would pity me, indeed you would commiſerate my ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings."</p>
                     <p>"Dear creature," ſaid he, drawing his chair cloſe to mine, "you know not how greatly your ſorrow intereſts me; tell me, is there any thing within the compaſs of my fortune, can reſtore peace to your agitated boſom; ſay how can I ſerve you, how ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you happy?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="unknown:029439_0210_0FE113DCE4ED8978"/>
"Oh! there is one way, and only one way," ſaid I, "by which you can promote my happineſs," and I dropped on my knees before him. "Riſe, riſe, my dear girl," ſaid he, "and do not heſitate to point out this only way, by which I can prove myſelf your friend."</p>
                     <p>"This humliating poſture beſt ſuits me," I replied, "here will I remain till I move your heart to compaſſion: indeed I am not that vile creature you may perhaps think me. I always avoided the inticements of vice till this fatal night; but the miſeries of a beloved parent, ſinking to the grave, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by ſickneſs and poverty drove me to ſacrifice my honour, to procure the means of prolonging her invaluable exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: if you are ſincere in your profeſſions of friendſhip, relieve my dear mother, and oh! I beſceeh you, ſpare the virtue of her wretched daughter."</p>
                     <p>"Riſe, then, my afflicted girl," ſaid he, "you ſhall be convinced of my ſincerity; I will obey the dictates of humanity; we will inſtantly go to your mother." He then left me for a few moments, when returning, he led me to a coach, and taking my direction, ordered the coachman to drive to our poor habitation. I heſitated at going away in the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:029439_0211_0FE113E36BE4A608"/>
cloaths the old woman had made me put on, but my deliverer told me he had paid for them.</p>
                     <p>When we arrived at our lodging, a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſenſation of pain and pleaſure dwelt upon my mind, and as I ran up ſtairs my limbs trembled ſo, they would ſcarce ſupport me; Mr. Welldon followed me up: I opened the door of the apartment, and ruſhing to the bedſide, cried "ſee my dear mother, the friend which heaven hath ſent us." My poor mother raiſed herſelf feebly in the bed, looked firſt at me, then at Mr. Welldon, then pointing to my altered dreſs and crying "theſe are the wages of infamy, all but this I could have born patiently." She fell back in a fit.</p>
                     <p>I thought ſhe was gone forever; frantic with deſpair, I tore off the dreſs which had ſo much alarmed her, and throwing myſelf on the bed beſide her, vowed never more to riſe, but that my life ſhould expiate my intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed offence. Mr. Welldon had ran away for medical aſſiſtance, and entered the room with an apothecary, juſt as my mother gave ſome ſigns of returning life. Proper reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were immediately applied and Mr. Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſoon convinced my reviving parent, that I had not entailed infamy on her latter days, or haſtened the period of her exiſtence by guilt or ſhame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="37" facs="unknown:029439_0212_0FE113E66277A390"/>
Our generous benefactor, now ſupplied me with money, not only to procure every neceſſary, but every comfort of life; and engaged the apothecary to attend my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther every day: but his care was all in vain; her diſorder daily gained ground, and I ſaw her end rapidly approaching. One day, when Mr. Welldon called to ſee us, my mother beckoned him to the bedſide. "Sir," ſaid ſhe, "if the prayers of a poor dying mortal are heard in heaven, you will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be rewarded for your benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, towards a helpleſs widow and orphan. To your generoſity I owe the honour of my child: oh! may ſhe never again be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to doubt the care of a watchful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and to avoid a temporary evil, ruſh into laſting miſery. To your care Mr. Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don I commit her, poor and defenceleſs as ſhe is; I do not fear your integrity; for the man, who in the gay hour of uncontrouled paſſion could ſave an innocent creature from deſtruction, will never lay a deliberate plan for her ſeduction. Meriel, you muſt be humble and induſtrious, and truſt heaven for ſupport." Mr. Welldon promiſed he would be my guardian and protector from every evil. "I place an implicit confidence in your word," ſaid my mother, "and ſhall die in peace."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="unknown:029439_0213_0FE113EC7B718F50"/>
"Oh! my dear Meriel," continued ſhe, faintly graſping my hand, "mayſt thou be virtuous and happy, and may the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent preſerve thee thro' life."</p>
                     <p>Celia, I feel I am unable to proceed, the moment that ſevered me from my dear mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will be always remembered as the moſt painful of my life. Adieu till I am more compoſed.</p>

My grief being in a great meaſure abated, Mrs. Lacour took an opportunity of ſpeaking to me concerning my future proſpects in life: "Mr. Welldon," ſaid ſhe, "intends, if you approve the plan, that you ſhall remain with me till you have attained a competent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:029439_0215_0FE113F63B5433B0"/>
of the millinery buſineſs, to be able to ſupport yourſelf without being any longer troubleſome to your benefactor. I know, Miſs Howard," continued ſhe, "that Mr. Welldon, does not think you an incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and that you are in no danger of any improper attempts from him; as I have heard him ſay the innate goodneſs of your heart has raiſed you ſo in his eſteem, that he regards you in the light of a ſiſter; and as ſuch will ſerve and protect you: but my dear young lady, you are poſſeſſed of ſtrong ſenſibility and to ſuch a heart as your's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance muſt be a heavy burthen. As another motive for your endeavouring to render yourſelf independent, I muſt inform you that Mr. Welldon will in a few weeks be married, and however innocent your mind, believe me the world will readily caſt illiberal cenſures on a young woman who lived in a ſtate of dependance on a married man; and ſhould it reach his lady's ears might be the ſource of great uneaſineſs, if not the cauſe of an irreparable breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them."</p>
                     <p>I was convinced of the propriety of theſe arguments, and chearfully acquieſced, while my heart overflowed with gratitude towards my generous benefactor, and I breathed a ſilent prayer to heaven, that his felicity in
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:029439_0216_0FE113FAE1AE15E8"/>
the married ſtate might be equal to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts.</p>
                     <p>A few days after this, Mr. Welldon call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I could not refrain my tears at ſight of this worthy man. Paſt ſcenes of ſorrow ruſhed upon my mind, which joined to the recollection of my then forlorn, dependant ſituation almoſt overcame me. He ſuffered me to eaſe my full heart, and then gently enquiring after my health, and how I liked Mrs. Lacour's family, hinted at my remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her, till I had attained a competent knowledge of her buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>"I know, my dear Miſs Howard," ſaid he, "that your education and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fit you to be placed in a more elevated ſphere. But my good girl muſt conſider that thoſe accompliſhments in her preſent circumſtances will be of no uſe. Nay, if they are ſuffered to appear will only excite the envy and ill nature of thoſe with whom ſhe is at preſent obliged to aſſociate. I would by no means have you neglect thoſe brilliant talents, with which nature has endowed you. It is not to be doubted, but you will find lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure hours when the pen or the pencil will be a happy relief to your mind, and prevent your dwelling too intently on paſt melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly events. But let thoſe hours of relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:029439_0217_0FE114004C2511E0"/>
be but few, above all things, be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to let your companions diſcover the ſuperiority you certainly poſſeſs over them. Educated, as you have been, perhaps you may think, that with great propriety you might undertake the education of children in ſome family of diſtinction, or become com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to ſome lady. I acknowledge, my fair friend, theſe are the ſituations for which you ſeem moſt adapted, but here an inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable obſtacle ariſes; you have no fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male friend who can recommend you; and the recommendation of a man, in theſe caſes, in general injures the perſon they mean to ſerve. You muſt, therefore, apply yourſelf attentively to your new profeſſion, and place a firm reliance on Providence to reward your induſtry with ſucceſs."</p>
                     <p>I had never attempted to interrupt Mr. Welldon, during this friendly harrangue, but finding he now continued ſilent, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, as well as my tears would permit, to convince him of my gratitude, by promiſing to do every thing which he had enjoined.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Lacour was now deſired to come in, when all terms having been previouſly agreed on, he paid my apprentice fee, and it was determined I ſhould remain with her twelve
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:029439_0218_0FE114045E81FB78"/>
months. Mr. Welldon then told me he had provided me an apartment to myſelf, and begged my acceptance of the furniture it contained. "This day three weeks, Miſs Howard," ſaid he, "will make me the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt of men in a union with a young lady of great merit, on whom I have deſervedly placed my affections. We ſhall ſet off im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on a viſit to the continent to ſee ſome relations, who reſide conſtantly in the ſouth of France, ſo that it may be a long time before I ſee you again. In this little pocket-book you will find a trifle to anſwer your immediate expences, and a direction to a gentleman, in the city, where in caſe of any future exigencies, you may apply, and he will give you both aſſiſtance and advice. God bleſs you, my dear girl; you have my beſt wiſhes, and may reſt aſſured of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable friendſhip." He then ſaluted me with the affection of a brother, and took his leave.</p>
                     <p>Soon after he was gone, Mrs. Lacour, by way of diverting my mind from the gloom our parting had caſt over it, aſked me if I had no curioſity to ſee the apartment Mr. Welldon had furniſhed for me. I followed her up two pair of ſtairs, into a neat back room, where was a tent bed, of ſtriped Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, with every neceſſary apurtenance,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:029439_0219_0FE11409865BEE00"/>
a caſe of drawers, a neat dreſſing caſe, and a ſmall trunk, the key of which Mrs. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour gave me, and bidding me with a ſmile examine my treaſures, went down ſtairs.</p>
                     <p>On opening the trunk I found it contained a piece of grey luteſtring, two pieces of dark chintz, each enough for a gown, about ten yards of muſlin, and a piece of fine linen. Removing theſe, I diſcovered at the bottom, a neat edition of the Engliſh poets, together with a bible and common prayer book; here alſo, I found a roll of drawing paper, which led me to imagine I was ſupplied with other materials for this elegant amuſement, and on opening the drawers, I found I had not been deceived in my conjectures; for there I found a box of crayons, pencils and colours, and a leather writing caſe, in which was a letter of truely brotherly advice. On open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a light cloſet that adjoined my bed cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I diſcovered another mark of the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attention of my benefactor; for there was a ſmall piano forte, with a collection of muſic by the beſt maſters. My little pocket-book contained a bank note for fifty pounds.</p>
                     <p>Oppreſſed by a ſenſe of theſe numerous obligations, my heart almoſt burſting with grateful emotions, I ſunk on my knees by the bed ſide, and poured forth my thanks
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:029439_0220_0FE1140C6DB5DFB0"/>
to the great Diſpoſer of all things, entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the choiceſt of his bleſſings might be ſhowered on my benefactor, and prayed his mercy ever to protect and direct me, nor ſuffer me again, impiouſly to doubt his power and watchful care.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, I entered on my new employment with alacrity. It is an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that keeps the mind continually amuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Mrs. Lacour is an amiable, chearful woman, and ſome of her young people, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, well informed girls. I do not like Mr. Lacour: he appears to me a pert, illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate coxcomb. But this does not give me any great uneaſineſs, as I am not much in his company, except at meal times. When the buſineſs of the day is finiſhed, I retire to my own apartment, where writing, reading or muſic, ſweetly relaxes and chears my mind: the time never hangs heavy; I feel a charming ſerenity pervade my heart, and Hope, that bright celeſtial gueſt, again has taken up her reſidence in my boſom. On a Sundy evening, I never fail viſiting the dear ſpot, that contains all that was earthly of my beloved mother. I cannot deſcribe my ſenſations when I approach the place. They are far from painful Celia, for the remembrance of her piety and virtue is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>THERE is in this family a Mademoiſelle Bagatelle, who is Mrs. Lacour's fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman; I do not like her, Celia, ſhe dreſſes in the extremity of the faſhion, takes ſnuff<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rouges high, and is high in the good graces of Monſieur Lacour. I can perceive they perfectly underſtand each other, tho' the prudent wife either does not, or will not, ſee the intimacy that ſubſiſts between them.</p>
                     <p>It has often been a ſubject of wonder to me, how people, whoſe tempers and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are the very reverſe of each other, could voluntarily put on the hymeneal yoke together; and yet we daily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="49" facs="unknown:029439_0224_0FE1141F9115DEF0"/>
being linked in the ſame chain: nay, what is more ſurpriſing that both parties eagerly put it on. How are we to account for theſe inconſiſtencies in human nature, nothing can be more oppoſite than the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Monſleur and Mrs. Lacour, and yet I have been told that it was a marriage of inclination and on the lady's ſide, entirely againſt the approbation of her friends; hence we muſt ſuppoſe, that either love throws a miſt over the diſcerning optics of its votaries, or that their is a fate in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which it is impoſſible to counteract.</p>
                     <p>You will, perhaps, wonder, my dear Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, that among the many long epiſtles I have lately wrote to you, the name of Rains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth has never eſcaped me: indeed, I have had afflictions of ſo much heavier a nature, than merely the loſs of a lover, that ſome months paſſed in which I hardly remembered there was ſuch a perſon in being: however in my preſent ſituation, being more eaſy in my mind, thought has frequently recurred to the period when I expected to have been united to him by indiſſoluble ties. When I think of him, I am feelingly convinced that my heart is ſtill attached; I almoſt doubt the intelligence of his infidelity, tho' con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to me by the hand of his father: I feel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

happineſs; I fancy, ſometimes that he might have heard reports to my diſadvantage; he might have been informed of my unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate elopement, of my thoughtleſs corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with Pringle: every circumſtance may have been exaggerated; and he may not be ſo culpable as I at firſt thought him. Theſe ideas often crowd my imagination. But he is married, Celia, and let his virtues be ever ſo briliant, he can be nothing to me.</p>
                     <p>I have heard by mere accident that my brother is in a fair way of making his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in India; I have wrote to him ſeveral times, but recieved no anſwer; not even a line has arrived from him, ſince the bill, which I mentioned in a former letter, was paid. Mr. Moſſop's family are I find removed into the country, and as to any of thoſe who called themſelves my friends in the day of proſperity, if I meet them now they ſtare me confidently in the face, but do not in the leaſt recollect me. Mrs. Lacour, tells me, that when fortune removes friends to any conſiderable diſtance from each other, the party who is the favourite of the fickle god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs almoſt immediately becomes near-ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and is afflicted with a ſhort memory.</p>

                        <p>I was yeſterday ſent to wait on a lady with ſome caps, &amp;c. in St. James's ſquare. When having waited about half an hour in a cold empty parlour, I thought I heard a voice that was familiar to my ears, but could not recollect whoſe it was. I was ſtriving to call it to my memory in vain, when the door opened, and who ſhould I behold but Miſs Pringle, and another young lady. "Come into this room young woman," ſaid ſhe, "here is a fire, and we will look over your trumpery." I went in my heart ſinking as I moved; for I knew enough of this once affectionate friend to ſuppoſe ſhe would not readily acknowledge an acquaintance with a milliner's apprentice. I ſaw, the moment ſhe caſt her eyes on me, ſhe recollected me; but as I did not wiſh to ſhew an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to renew our acquaintance, I caſt down my eyes and remained ſilent, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if ſhe did not chooſe to take notice of me, ſhe might ſettle it within herſelf that I did not know her. But the lady's curioſity was more predominent than her pride. She looked at me ſeveral times and at length cried "if I did not think it almoſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I ſhould ſay your name was Howard." "My name is Howard, ma'am," ſaid I cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. "Why, ſure as I am alive, it is Meriel

Howard." "The very ſame, Miſs Pringle." "La! my dear girl, why how came you in this ſituation, ſuch a fortune as you had left you." "We are all ſubject to viciſſitudes of fortune," ſaid I ſmiling, "but I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely happy in my preſent ſituation."</p>
                        <p>"Happy!" ſaid ſhe, lifting up her eyes in ſurprize. "I am aſtoniſhed to hear you ſay ſo, for my part I ſhould be the moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature on earth, was I reduced to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a band-box." "Happineſs and miſery, Miſs," ſaid I, "are in general the reſult of our own ideas: if I am content in my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtation, I am in my own mind as happy, nay, perhaps happier than the woman, who riding in a chariot and pair, envies one whoſe ſuperior fortune can command four or ſix horſes."</p>
                        <p>She did not ſeem to comprehend me, but turning to the other lady, ſaid, "well I vow ſiſter it is very aſtoniſhing; but this young woman, only four years ago, had a fortune of four thouſand pounds, her father liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the neighbourhood of our country-houſe. My brother was very fond of her once, and I believe ſhe did not altogether diſlike him, did you Meriel? I fancy your little heart never regained its liberty."</p>

"I rather ſuppoſe, Miſs Pringle, that it never was a captive. If at one time I was fooliſh enough to fancy myſelf in love with your brother, it was before I had the power of diſtinguiſhing a real from an ideal paſſion, or before I was a competent judge of what would be moſt conducive to my own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs."</p>

"My brother is in India—I have no parents."</p>
                        <p>"Poor, dear girl," ſaid the other young lady, now ſpeaking for the firſt time, "that is a dreadful thing. I know what it is to

have no parents." She took my hand, and I ſaw her mild eyes gliſten with compaſſion.</p>
                        <p>I wiſhed to put an end to this painful converſation, and therefore deſired to know if they would keep any of the caps. "Oh, yes, I ſhall have ſeveral, but ſtop Meriel, I muſt let my mother know you are here. Dear, how ſhe will be ſurprized; and you ſhall go down to Baker, ſhe will pay you, and do have a glaſs of wine before you go, and a bit of bride cake: you don't know I am married."</p>
                        <p>"I wiſh you much happineſs madam," ſaid I, coldly; "but I cannot ſtay to take any refreſhment: I have been here much longer than I ought to have ſtaid." You muſt know, my dear Celia, that my pride was hurt at the idea of ſtanding firſt to be catechiſed by the mother, and then be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed to the houſe-keeper for wine and cake; and this treatment from a girl, who once called herſelf my friend, and thought herſelf honoured by the title. However, I could not eſcape; the mother was called, and the bell rang for Mrs. Baker. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Mrs. Pringle's queſtions in as ſhort a manner as poſſible; but obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed going down with the houſe-keeper. "Ah! poor girl," ſaid Mrs. Pringle, in an

                        <p>"You are miſtaken madam," ſaid I, "I do not feel the leaſt embaraſſment from the reflection that I owe my ſupport to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry: it is what many, more worthy than myſelf are obliged to do, it is by no means hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>They could not anſwer. Shame and aſtoniſhment tied their tongues. I curtſied ſlightly and followed Mrs. Baker out of the room. While ſhe was paying me, the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacious

houſe-keeper informed me that her maſter had been married about three weeks; that he never ſaw Miſs Pringle till within a month of their union; that he danced with her at a ball, and was ſtruck with her pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſon, and inſinuating manner; "but I can ſee," continued ſhe, "it will not be a very happy union; and Miſs Sally, poor girl, will be more unhappy than ever. It was a ſad thing, ſir John left her depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant on her brother." "What then," ſaid I, "your maſter is a baronet?" "No," ſaid ſhe, "his father was a knight, but the title died with him. He was a wealthy citizen, and was knignted for carrying an addreſs to the king on ſome particular occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion." I had now received my money, and not wiſhing to pry into the ſecrets of a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with whom I deſired not to form any connection, I wiſhed Mrs. Baker a good morning, and left the houſe. In the hall I met Miſs Sally. "You will have a long walk Miſs Howard," ſaid ſhe; "had I any command here, you ſhould not carry that heavy box."</p>
                        <p>"It is not heavy, Miſs," ſaid I.</p>
                        <p>"But it is cumberſome," ſhe replied, "and you are not accuſtomed to ſuch employment." She then opened the door
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:029439_0232_0FE1144468EBB540"/>
herſelf, and ſmiling, with a ſweet look of benevolence, wiſhed me a good morning. I pitied the dear girl, for ſure I am, if ſhe is dependant on her brother, her new ſiſter will not contribute to make her life very comfortable.</p>
                        <p>As I walked home, I could not avoid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on this rencounter with Miſs Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle; nor did my heart entirely approve my own conduct: there was too much pride in the manner in which I ſpoke to her: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſince I have been poor, Celia, I have diſcovered that I am very proud, much more ſo than is becoming; I will endeavour to correct this error, and in future adapt my ſentiments to the ſtation in which it has pleaſed Providence to place me.</p>
                        <p>I have met with many civilities from ſome of Mrs. Lacour's cuſtomers; eſpecially a Mrs. Moreton, who is a woman of very gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel fortune, at leaſt, if I am to conjecture from the manner in which ſhe lives: ſhe is very fond of poetry, and has adviſed me to endeavour to raiſe a ſubſcription for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of thoſe poems I formerly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you. Mrs. Lacour does not diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the plan, and I am by this indulging woman, allowed more time to purſue my favourite ſtudy, than I ſhould have met with
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:029439_0233_0FE1144E16CAD2D8"/>
in any other place. I have obtained ſeveral very reſpectable names to my ſubſcription; and have ſome cards of propoſals printed which I keep in the ſhop to preſent to the ladies who conſtantly frequent it. I cannot ſay, Celia, but it would be much more pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, could I obtain a living by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of any of my natural talents, than by following the ſtraight forward path of the plodding woman of buſineſs; beſides I was never deſigned for a milliner, I cannot flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I cannot tell a woman whom age, and other natural defects, have rendered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely plain, that a full dreſs cap with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial flowers ſmall handkerchief, and all the gay trappings that belong to the ſmiling ſeaſon of eighteen, will become her face and figure: and yet this is a very neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient in the compoſition of a milliner. I wiſh to my heart ſome other plan could be ſtruck out, where I ſhould not be obliged to ſay and atteſt things ſo directly contrary to my own opinion. I am not ſo happy in this family as I at firſt thought I ſhould be, Mr. Lacour pays me too much attention lately; I hate the forward concieted fellow, tho' were it only to mortify Mademoiſelle I could take a pleaſure in liſtening to his non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe; but when I reflect that by ſo doing I may wound the peace of a deſerving woman, who treats me with tenderneſs, and favours

me with her eſteem, I feel ſuch a mixture of horror end deteſtation riſe in my heart, that I frequently anſwer his paſſionate ſallies with an acrimony, that makes him bite his lips with vexation.

                     <p>AGAIN, my beloved Celia, am I caſt upon the world without a friend to guide me; ſcarcely yet have I ſeen twenty years, and what viciſſitudes of fortune have I experienced.

                           <p>WHEN your friend, Mr. Welldon, left England he did not propoſe ſtaying above ſix weeks or two months at moſt; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately for him he has been detained on the continent by a continued ſeries of ill health, and he is now at Aix-la-Chappelle in a very dangerous ſtate. When laſt I ſaw him he gave me a very particular account of your firſt acquaintance with him, an account which I muſt confeſs raiſed you both in my opinion, as it proved the goodneſs of your hearts: he alſo informed me in what manner he had placed you with Mrs. Lacour, and deſired I would frequently call and enquire how you went on, and whether you were ſatisfied with the treatment you reciev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Family uneaſineſs, and various vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have prevented my fulfilling my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, till laſt Thurſday, when I called at Mrs. Lacour's, and the reſult of that viſit leads me to trouble you with this letter; for as I muſt naturally feel intereſted in the welfare of every one dear to Mr. Welldon, I think it my duty to give you a little advice, and to let you know in what light you are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:029439_0237_0FE1145D566C8E08"/>
by the major part of the family where you reſide. At the time I made my viſit you were out, waiting on ſome ladies: Mrs. Lacour ſpoke of you in the tendereſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but ſaid you were by no means calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for the buſineſs Mr. Welldon had placed you in; her ſenſibility is very great ſir, ſaid ſhe, and her notions ſo very refined and delicate, ſhe is totally unable to bear the rude and often inſulting manners of many of our cuſtomers: beſides, ſir, ſhe loves ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy too well ever to make any great profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent at her needle. Mrs. Lacour being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led away, a pert, forward French woman un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to finiſh your character: ſhe threw out the moſt malignant aſperſions on your conduct in general, ſaid you had made your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the laughing ſtock of the whole family, that many of the ladies who frequented the ſhop, diſtinguiſhed you by the appellation of little ſcribbler: that you were thoughtleſs, extravagant, proud, vain, and indolent: and that you had by your artful conduct alienated the affection of monſieur Lacour from his wife, and in all theſe aſſertions ſhe wss joined by her companions, who ſeemed to conſider you only as a fit object of ridicule.</p>
                           <p>Tho' I could not avoid ſeeing the motive that inſtigated theſe women was envy, yet the reviewers call it ſad traſh, and my lady
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:029439_0238_0FE1146206E71AE8"/>
I muſt think you have not conducted your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf altogether in the prudent manner I ſhould have expected from the character Mr. Welldon gave of you. Conſider Miſs How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, induſtry is the only hope you can have of future ſupport: let me conjure you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as a friend, to throw aſide the pen, and apply to your needle, and let your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive fancy be exerted to decorate the perſons of your fair country women. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, the hill of Parnaſſus is too high for you to climb, unleſs you had the hand of independance to help you up; the fineſt turned poem will be entirely overlooked by the world when uſhered into it by an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure author; while a raphſody of nonſenſe will be univerſally read and applauded when the author is publicly known to be favoured with the ſmiles of fortune. We will ſuppoſe, my dear, that you had finiſhed a pleaſing elegant poem, eſſay, novel, or what not; and that ſome bookſeller ſhould for a trifling conſideration engage to introduce it to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic notice; a new publication no ſooner makes it appearance than the people of faſhion enquire, who the author is. "Have you read the new poem my lady?" ſays ſir Timothy Trifle. "No not I, is it good for any thing?" "'Pon honour I don't know, Pedegree told me it was wrote by a little milliner, who lived at Lacour's,"</p>
                           <p>

"Prithee, dear ſir Timothy, no more, I am quite ſick already; what can a milliner's girl know of litirature?" Thus my dear, you will find people of faſhion will not give your book a peruſal: and tho' there are ſome few who may read it with pleaſure, and give it the encomiums its merit deſerves, they will be aſhamed to avow an opinion contrary to that of their ſuperiors; while the generality of the world ſatisfied with the ſentence already paſſed, will not be at the trouble of reading and judging for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: the conſequence will be you will not ſell enough to pay the expence of printing and paper, and you will have the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſee your poems uſed as waſte pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to wrap up parcels, &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>I flatter myſelf, your natural good ſenſe will lead you to conſider this letter in the friendly light it was intended, that you will do your utmoſt to eradicate from the minds of your companions every idea they may have formed to your diſadvantage, that you will drop all thought of ſhining in the literary world, and apply yourſelf chearfully to that employment by which you may hope to paſs through life with comfort and reſpectability.</p>

The reception of this letter made me very uneaſy, eſpecially the part which mentioned the illneſs of my kind hearted benefactor: I was grieved alſo to find what a bubble I had been to Mademoiſelle and all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices, as they had all pretended to be greatly pleaſed with my writings, and had often ſaid it was a thouſand pities, ſo bright a genius ſhonld be buried in oblivion: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it opened my eyes to their deceit and flattery; and I determined to be more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my guard in future. I felt extremely grateful to Mr. Friendly for the trouble he had taken in writing to me, anſwered his letter immediately, promiſed to profit by his advice, and reqneſted to be again favoured with a few lines whenever he ſhould hear from Mr. Welldon.</p>
                     <p>From this time I applied myſelf with great aſſiduity to my employment; tho' I could not help noticing a viſible alteration in Mrs. Lacour's behaviour: ſhe becauſe cold and diſtant, frequently ſpoke to me in a tone of diſpleaſure, and ſeemed carefully to avoid my converſation, except what was abſolutely neceſſary in the buſineſs. The apprentices treated me with diſreſpect, and Mademoiſelle aimed at me the moſt pointed ſarcaſms. Things were in this ſituation, when one day as I was ſitting penſive in a
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:029439_0241_0FE114700035BDD0"/>
little back parlour, where we uſually break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſted, I was ſurpriſed by the ſudden en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of Monſieur Lacour, who began in the uſual ſtrain to profeſs his admiration, and audaciouſly ſolicited return of his illicit paſſion.</p>
                     <p>"Your inſolence ſir," ſaid I, "is inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable, I can no longer ſubmit to it, and if ever again you ſhock my ears with ſuch infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſolicitations I will inform your much injured wife of your intimacy with Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle." I then would have left the room but he threw himſelf between me and the door, and ſeizing my hand, impudently ſwore, my threat proceeded only from jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy. "But come my ſweet creature," ſaid he "do not let that make you uneaſy, I will promiſe never to ſpeak to Bagatelle again." He then fell on his knees with a look of lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrous grimace, which at another time would only have made me laugh: but at that time I felt far different ſenſations. Unable to free myſelf from his graſp, and hurt at the mean opinion he entertained of me, all my forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude forſook me, and I burſt into tears. At that moment the door opened, and in ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mrs. Lacour, Mademoiſelle and Mr. Friendly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="67" facs="unknown:029439_0242_0FE11472B88DD438"/>
"Oh Meriel!" cried Mrs. Lacour; "I could not have believed"—She would have fallen to the ground, had I not ſprang for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to catch her as ſhe fainted.</p>
                     <p>"You ſee ſir," ſaid Mademoiſelle to Mr. Friendly, as we were ſupporting Mrs. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour to a chair. "You ſee ſir, I told you only the truth." Monſieur, in the general confuſion walked unobſerved away. My diſtreſs was very great to ſee Mrs. Lacour in this ſituation. I feared it might be of dangerous conſequence, as ſhe was far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in her pregnancy. I ſupported her in my arms, chafed her temples with Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary water, and on the firſt return of life, begged her not to think me ſo guilty as I appeared. She ſhook her head, puſhed me from her, and leaning on Mademoiſelle's arm, went out of the room.</p>
                     <p>I then addreſſed Mr. Friendly as a ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for I did not at that time perſonally know him; and entreated he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to heal this breach between Mrs. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and myſelf: "indeed ſir," ſaid I, "ſhe is the only friend I have; I would ſooner die than injure her." I then related briefly every thing that had paſt, and fully explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cauſe of the tears he ſaw me ſhed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="unknown:029439_0243_0FE114788F979F78"/>
"Appearances are undoubtedly againſt you Miſs Howard," ſaid he, "but I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to believe you innocent. I am extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorry there is any diſſention between you and Mrs. Lacour, ſhe being as you have juſt remarked, your only friend. I yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day received a letter from Mrs. Welldon, informing me that her huſband died about a fortnight ſince. She mentions you as a perſon of whom Mr. Welldon ſpoke in his laſt moments, and deſires me to give you fifty pounds, to buy mourning; at the ſame time ſhe bids me inform you it is the laſt you will recieve from her."</p>
                     <p>I was ſo overcome, indeed I may ſay ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified with grief, I was totally unable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. He ſaw and I believe pitied my diſtreſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thus continued. "I have added to this little preſent fifty pounds more; and would adviſe you to leave this family immediately, and in ſome genteel neigbourhood open a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhop, endeavour to gain employment; be prudent and induſtrious, and I have no doubt of your ſucceſs; but prithee, good my girl, burn your pens and paper, and believe me, a woman makes as awkward a figure engaged in literary purſuits, as a counſellor would do ſeated at a tambour frame or buſied in aſſort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing colours for embroidery." I promiſed to
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:029439_0244_0FE1147BA5FDC0F8"/>
remember his friendly advice, he paid me the money and took his leave.</p>
                     <p>I was now anxious to ſee Mrs. Lacour but all attempts to that purpoſe were fruitleſs. I wrote a letter proteſting my innocence and received a verbal anſwer by one of the apren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices that the thing was too plain to admit of any doubt, that ſhe wiſhed me well but had no deſire ever to ſee me again. I retired to my apartment with a heart overcharged with ſorrow. At any other time, the death of my benevolent friend Mr. Welldon would have been in itſelf a ſufficient affliction: but now I had the additional one of knowing I had tho, unintionally, injured the health of a woman, I ſincerely eſteemed, incurred the cenſures of the world, and caſt an indeliable blemiſh on my reputation, which it had ever been my ſtudy to preſerve unſullied. In theſe melancholy reflections I paſt the day; in the evening the ſervant brought me up a candle and ſome ſupper: but I was too much agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to eat, and went early to bed, tho' I was fully convinced that to ſleep would be impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>About twelve o'clock I heard a great buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle below, and fearing for Mrs. Lacour I jumped out of bed and opening my chamber door to liſten, plainly heard one of the young
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:029439_0245_0FE11481749691F8"/>
women ſay, "ſhe cannot live, the doctor ſays it is impoſſible." Terrified beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I put on a few cloaths and ran haſtily down ſtairs, determined at all events to ſee this dear ſufferer, and by convincing her of my innocence reſtore her mind to peace. The danger ſhe was in had thrown the family into ſuch confuſion, that I found no oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made to my entering the appartment. The curtains were cloſe drawn round the bed, and there was little light in the room, ſo that ſhe did not perceive me when I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, I found the agitation of her mind had thrown her into a premature labour, and that the ſurgeon imagined her life to be in iminent danger. Every other thought was now abſorbed in my anxiety for her. I beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned her ſiſter who was ſetting by the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. She came to me, I told her the diſtreſs of my mind and begged her to believe me not guilty. "Dear Meriel," ſaid ſhe, "I never thought you ſo, nor would my poor ſiſter have ever entertained an idea to your prejudice, had it not been for the inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Bagatelle, who has now plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the motive which led her ſo malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to aſperſe your character: however no one can now have a doubt of your inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. Mademoiſelle went out about eight this evening, which greatly ſurpriſed us, as my ſiſter was ſo ill. As the evening ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:029439_0246_0FE114845A7D7E80"/>
her abſcence became more aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and about an hour ſince a perſon called who had ſeen Bagatelle and the ungrateful Lacour get into a chaiſe at an inn door and drive off for Dover."</p>
                     <p>Tho' my heart bled for Mrs. Lacour, I could not but rejoice that this proceeding of theirs was a convicing proof of my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. I inquired, if this unfortunate wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had been informed of their perfidy, and being anſwered in the affirmative, and told that the intelligence had precipitated her illneſs, I aſked, if I might be permited to ſpeak to her. When ſhe was informed that I was in the room, ſhe called me to her with a faint voice, and taking hold of my hand, ſaid, "Meriel, forgive me, I have injured you; but I was myſelf decieved." She could not ſay more, her pains became excruciating, and after continuing many hours in a ſtate of exquiſite torture, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned her breath, having given birth to a female infant who ſurvived her mother but a few moments.</p>
                     <p>Lacour's flight, and his wife's death was ſoon ſpread abroad; and it was diſcovered that he had not only collected all the debts, previous to his departure, but had alſo ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the houſe of every thing valuable, ſo
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:029439_0247_0FE1148A105A0130"/>
that when the creditors brought in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, there was not ſufficient property to pay five ſhillings in the pound. Every thing was immediately ſeized, and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Mrs. Lacour would have been obliged to the pariſh for a decent funeral, had not her ſiſter, tho' but in indifferent circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and myſelf borne the expence between us. When I had paid every neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the memory of this unfortunate wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I began to think of my own affairs. You may remember my mentioning a Mrs. Moreton, from whom I had recieved many civilities. She lived at a ſmall village a few miles out of town. To her I applied for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in my preſent embarraſſing ſituation. She received me with politeneſs, told me ſhe would exert herſelf to the utmoſt to ſerve me and faid ſhe thought I might make my buſineſs anſwer very well in Kenſington, where ſhe had many friends to whom ſhe could recommend me. To a heart formed for all the endearing and ſocial ties of life, how every little kindneſs is received with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and how does it feel the attentions even of common civility. I feel myſelf grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attached to this Mrs. Moreton, her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is the moſt prepoſeſſing, her form elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and and ſhe poſeſſes the polite accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments in an imminent degree. She is the wife of an officer now in India, by whom
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:029439_0248_0FE1148F0534AFF8"/>
ſhe has two lovely children, her manſion is a little terreſtial paradiſe. Every thing about it is neat, compact, and charming.</p>
                     <p>I have not as yet met with an apartment to ſuit me, tho' I have ſeen ſeveral, however it is determined I ſhall not have a ſhop but carry on my buſineſs as a chamber milliner.</p>
                     <p>My heart almoſt ſinks at the idea of a young, unprotected creature like myſelf, venturing upon ſuch a plan, but what can I do, convinced as I am of the impoſſibilty of ever doing any thing in the literary way, I ſhall never more renew my attempts.</p>
                     <p>I muſt remember the laſt words of my dear mother, "be humble, patient and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, and rely on heaven for ſupport." Let me have your prayers, my beloved Celia. But I need not aſk them, I am ſure my ſweet benevolent friend looks round the whole univerſe with an eye of heavenly complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and wiſhes every boſom as tranquil as her own; and that your happineſs may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be diminiſhed, is the fervant prayer of</p>

                     <p>I AM now ſettled in a very neat apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, within about a half a mile of Mrs. Moreton's houſe; the people with whom I lodge appear obliging and friendly, and from the ſpecimen I have already had, I think I ſhall obtain a very genteel living, as I have much more work than I can perform myſelf, and am obliged to employ ſeveral young women. My Sundays I always ſpend with Mrs. Moreton, accompanying her to church in the morning, ſhe dines ſo late, it is impoſſible to go in the afternoon. She has introduced me to the family of a Mr. Belger, a man of great genius, and independent fortune: Mrs. Belger is the moſt exquiſitely beautiful woman I ever beheld; but ſhe has no accompliſhments, nor can I think ſhe has been even decently educated; indeed, I
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:029439_0250_0FE11497B48A0708"/>
have heard it whiſpered that ſhe is not his wife; however, ſhe goes by his name, does the honours of his table, and has by him a ſweet little girl, the very image of her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful mother: this child has more firmly knit the bonds that holds her faithful to its father; but tho' every look, word and action, ſpeaks the ardency and purity of her attachment: he treats her with a co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> reſpect, which I am ſure muſt cut her to the ſoul: he is civil, polite, but diſtant. In this fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I ſpend many agreeable hours; I think Mr. Belger the moſt ſenſible man I ever converſed with, indeed, the more I converſe with him the more I am convinced of my own ignorance; he kindly endeavours to inſtruct me, directs my taſte in the choice of authors, corrects my judgment, and takes great pleaſure in improving me in both mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic and drawing. To confeſs the truth, I have but little time to ſpare for theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits; but I ſometimes ſteal a few hours from reſt to perform my neceſſary employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that I may the next day have a little time to attend to Mr. Belger's inſtructions.

<pb n="76" facs="unknown:029439_0251_0FE1149D2CE13E18"/>
other evening he loved to hear my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments delivered with ſuch charming enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm, tho' they were in direct oppoſition to his own. I have had ſome doubt about the propriety of continuing my intimacy in this family, as Mrs. Belger is ſuppoſed to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his miſtreſs; but her whole conduct is ſuch as may call a bluſh upon the cheek of many an inſolent woman, who looking with mercileſs diſdain on her poor fallen ſiſters, ſmiles contemptouſly and thanks hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhe is virtuous. Mrs. Belger is a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, exemplary mother, a kind miſtreſs to her ſervants, a good chriſtian, and a meek, obedient, faithful, I had almoſt ſaid wife; but the myſtic words have not paſſed that can render her character reſpectable in every eye: you will therefore ſay, my dear Celia, ſhe is an improper companion for a girl whoſe reputation has once been doubted, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be regained by aſſociating with a woman, whoſe character is ſuſpicious: True, my dear girl, but I feel myſelf ſo attached to the family ſo grateful for the attentions ſhewn me, and am ſo conſcious of my own ſolitary friendleſs ſituation, that my heart deprived of every affection, every fond hope on which it once reſted, naturally clings to thoſe whoſe kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſooths its anxieties to reſt.</p>

                        <p>I have been ſo frightened, my dear Celia, that I believe it will be ſometime before I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover myſelf; and I cannot but conſider it a great mercy that I am alive and able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the cauſe of my terror. In the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adjoining the room where I ſleep, the maid of the houſe ſleeps with two of the younger children, for they have a large fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. About four o'clock this morning, I was awoke by a ſenſe of ſuffocation, and ſtarting up, perceived my chamber to be full of ſmoak, I jumped out of bed and looking round to ſee that there was no appearance of fire in the room, ventured to open one of the windows a little way to diſperſe it. I then opened the door, which led to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens room, here the ſmoak was more thick, and I found the ſmell of fire grow ſtronger; but what were my ſenſations, on going into their apartment to ſee a baſket of cloaths which ſtood on a chair by the bedſide all on fire, and the curtains of the bed which were fortunately of woolen juſt beginning to burn. I had not an inſtant for conſideration, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence directed me; for I am conſcious that reaſon was for a few moments intirely ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, I ran back to my own bed; drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of a blanket and immediately threw it over the burning baſket, at the ſame time
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:029439_0253_0FE114A6ACB16FD0"/>
pouring on it a large pan of water, which ſtood in the room, and had been placed there for the purpoſe of waſhing the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. I then awoke the ſervant, and took the dear little innocents out of the bed; they had been ſo nearly ſuffocated it was with difficulty I awoke them, and when brought into the air blood guſhed from their noſes: when I had a little recovered them and laid them in my bed, I returned to the other chamber, ſent the maid down for more water, and having entirely extinguiſhed every appearance of fire, began to have the uſe of reflection: my own almoſt miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous eſcape from ſo horrible a death, the ſafety of the children, nay, the preſervation of the lives and property of the whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, impreſſed my mind with ſuch awful gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude towards the Power, who had in ſuch unexpected danger inſpired and directed me, that I threw myſelf on my knees and burſt into tears of unfeigned thankfulneſs. Had I not diſcovered it at the time I did, we muſt all have inevitably periſhed; for the reſt of the family lay in apartments built diſtinctly from this part of the houſe: the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I occupied were over the ſhop, and this room really belonged to me, but as I had no uſe for it I gave it up to the ſervant and children. The maſter, miſtreſs, three more children and two apprentices, ſlept on
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:029439_0254_0FE114A9FAFD3A10"/>
the ground floor behind the ſhop, ſo that the whole front of the houſe might have been in flames, before they would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it. I aſked the girl how ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined the accident had happened; ſhe ſaid ſhe often was obliged to ſit up very late for her maſter, that ſhe had been up that night, till near two o'clock, and being obliged to work very hard in the day time, ſhe was very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>leepy and weary; that ſhe imagines ſhe muſt have left the candle burning on the floor, and that it had caught ſome of the linen that hung from the baſket. You may eaſily ſuppoſe I was not inclined to go to bed again, I therefore dreſſed myſelf, and waited the riſing of the family. When I heard Mrs. Newtram up, I took the two young children in my hand and went down. "You are up early, Miſs Howard," ſaid ſhe, "I hope the children have not been making a noiſe to diſturb you." "I was up much earlier than you can imagine," I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "but believe me theſe little dears have been very quiet and good, but I was ſadly alarmed this morning at four o'clock."</p>
                        <p>"Alarmed, my dear ma'am, at what?" "At an accident which had like to prove fatal to us all." "Good God!" ſaid ſhe, "what can have been the matter?" "Come, come, my good Mrs. Newtram," ſaid I, ſeeing her turn pale, "there is no occaſion for terror
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:029439_0255_0FE114AFDB4BBF48"/>
now, the danger is paſt, you ſee your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are ſafe, but we have been all on fire up ſtairs to night." "Merciful heaven!" ſaid ſhe, "that careleſs Betty." "Do not blame the girl Mrs. Newtram, fatigued as ſhe is in the day time, ſhe cannot be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed capable of ſitting up till two or three o'clock in the morning, eſpecially when we recollect ſhe in general riſes at ſix, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her daily avocations; and I will juſt beg leave to mention that it is my earneſt wiſh ſhe may be forgiven: ſhe has ſuffered enough already from her fright, do not, therefore, reproach her, and I will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable ſuch an accident never happens again in any place where ſhe is." I then took Mrs. Newtram up ſtairs, and ſhewed her the things that had been on fire. When ſhe ſaw the imminent danger to which her children had been expoſed, ſhe caught them in her arms and with all the enthuſiaſm of maternal affection, bleſt heaven for their preſervation. "Oh! Miſs Howard," ſaid ſhe, "how can we ever be grateful enough for your quick recollection in ſuch an alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſituation; we are bound to conſider you as our guardian angel."</p>
                        <p>I ſtopped the good woman in the midſt of her acknowledgments, to renew my entre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for Betty's pardon, and that ſhe might
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:029439_0256_0FE114B4210ED078"/>
be continued in her place. "I can deny you nothing," ſaid ſhe; "but I am afraid Mr. Newtram will be inveterate againſt her." "That will be cruel indeed," ſaid I, "for he was himſelf undoubtedly the prior cauſe of the accident, by keeping ſuch very late hours." She then went down ſtairs, and I went to breakfaſt; which before I had half finiſhed was interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Newtram. He repeated every acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment before made by his wife, ſealed Betty's pardon, and declared he wiſhed for nothing more, than for ſome opportunity to convince me of his gratitude, and that he would almoſt lay down his life to ſerve me. Thus you ſee, my dear Celia, this accident will in the end terminate for my good, as it ſeems to have ſecured the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and friendſhip of thoſe, in whoſe houſe I reſide; and in caſe of future trouble I make no doubt, but I ſhall find in theſe worthy people, a kindneſs nearly maternal. Farewell my friend; your's ever.</p>

                     <p>MR. BELGER has frequently private concerts at his houſe. I always am one of the party. Sometimes I perform on the piano forte; ſometimes ſing, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways meet with ſuch applauſe, as almoſt makes me vain; indeed the praiſes of Mr. Belger only, are ſufficient for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. He is the only man I could ever think perfectly agreeable, ſince the conduct of Rainsforth gave me ſo very deſpicable an opinion of the whole ſex. But of one thing I am convinced; it is dangerous to enter into arguments with perſons who have an improper opinion of religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. I have had frequent converſations with Mr. Belger on this topic, and inſtead of being able to convince him of his errors. (You will tremble whem I tell you) I have only imbibed his principles, and find doubt ariſing in my mind concerning the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

parts of the holy writings. Oh! my dear Celia, pray for your weak friend, that ſhe may not be loſt by liſtening to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating man. I have indeed made fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent reſolutions to avoid his company, and as frequently broke them. I take my heart ſeverely to taſk. Surely Celia, after it has ſuffered ſo much from the perfidy of the ſex, it cannot be ſo weak, nay ſo wicked, as to feel an attachment for a man who is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's right. Do not fear for me, my belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friend; if I cannot command my feelings I can my actions. Should I at ſome future period diſcover that Rainsforth is not the capricious character, he at preſent appears, I will never have the mortification to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, I have rendered myſelf unworthy of his eſteem: if otherwiſe, it ſhall never be in the power of any man to boaſt, that he has triumphed over the virtue of Meriel Howard. No Celia, I may be unfortunate, but I never will be guilty.</p>
                     <p>Buſineſs does not anſwer ſo well as I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.

                     <p>WHAT a world this is, my friend, and of what a medly of ſtrange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent characters is it compoſed. Were it not impious, I could wiſh I had never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it. Some few years ſince, I believed every heart glowed with humanity, friendſhip and ſincerity toward each other. Yes, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, at the time I left the convent theſe were
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:029439_0260_0FE114C63AA45C10"/>
my ideas of the world. Nay it is but very lately I began to perceive how erroneous my opinion was; but believe me, the more we know of mankind the leſs we find to admire or eſteem. The heart grows hardened by repeated diſappointments, and from having an unbounded confidence in our fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we begin to ſuſpect every one of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy.</p>
                     <p>My dear friend, I am ſtill the ſport of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious fortune. Deceived, betrayed by thoſe I moſt loved and truſted, I have no comfort left but my dependance on heaven, (which thank God, I have regained) and the conſcious integrity of my own heart.</p>
                     <p>Some little time after my laſt letter, Mrs. Moreton called on me one morning, in her way to town, and aſked if I would take a ride with her. She was in Mr. Belger's carriage. I had nothing to prevent me and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately complied. We proceeded to town, and ſtopped at a ſilk mercer's. Mrs. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ordered ſome ſilks to be put up, but when ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ame to pay for them, diſcovered ſhe had left her purſe behind her. I had money ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient about me, and therefore offered to pay the amount of the bill. "Do ſo, my dear," ſaid ſhe, "it will be all the ſame. I can pay you again when we get home." It came to
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:029439_0261_0FE114CB732FAEF8"/>
upwards of ten pounds, as ſhe purchaſed a piece of ſilk for a lady whom ſhe expected out of the country. When we returned the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected lady was arrived. She approved the ſilk, and after dinner took a walk to my apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where ſhe ordered ſome very elegant linen to be made: the lace ſhe choſe it to be trimed with, was two guineas per yard. You can get this done by Saturday afternoon, ſaid Mrs. Moreton, for we are obliged to pay a viſit to very particular people, and this lady would wiſh to have it to wear. As ſoon as they were gone, I wrote to a laceman in town, to ſend me more of the lace; for the handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, apron, and ruffles were all to be full trimed. As I had dealt with him before, he did not heſitate. The muſlin I had by me; and on Saturday afternoon, according to their deſire, I took the whole ſuit home, which, when finiſhed, came to near fifty pounds. They were much pleaſed with it, and deſired I would bring my bill on Monday morning, about twelve o'clock. I had a ſmall gold watch by my ſide, which was given me by Mr. Welldon. It was of no great value, but for the ſake of the doner, it was highly prized by me. "Meriel, my love," ſaid Mrs. Moreton, "I have ſent my watch to be cleaned; I ſhall be at a loſs to know how time goes: do lend me your's for this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="87" facs="unknown:029439_0262_0FE114CFB7522F88"/>
"I ſet great ſtore by it, madam," ſaid I, "it was the gift of a deceaſed friend; but I think you will be careful of it." "As I would of my own," ſhe replied, as ſhe took it. "Stay, madam," ſaid I, "there is a little trinket to it which I have vowed never to part with." (It was a ſmall locket which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a lock of my dear mother's hair). She ſuffered me to take it off, and Mr. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger's coach coming to the door to attend the ladies, they ſet me down at my own lodging, and proceeded to town.</p>
                     <p>The next day, being Sunday, I dined at Mr. Belger's, where I was ſurpriſed to hear that the ladies had ſent home the carriage, without returning themſelves, and that Mrs. Moreton's children were in town with her. However I felt no uneaſineſs or ſuſpicion, and on Monday morning repaired to Mrs. Moreton's with my bill: but to my utter aſtoniſhment found the houſe entirely ſhut up, and was informed by a neighbour, that it was a ready furniſhed houſe, which ſhe had occupied near a twelve-month, and that ſhe had diſcharged her ſervant on Saturday morning; that they had every reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhe did not intend to come back again, for ſhe had not paid the houſe rent, and was beſides in debt to every body in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, who would truſt her; and that
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:029439_0263_0FE114D4DA8A72E8"/>
on going into the houſe, which the landlord had done early this morning, they found nothing in it that had ever belonged to her; but miſſed a conſiderable quantity of linen, which had been lent her when ſhe took the houſe.</p>
                     <p>I was now fatally convinced that my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in Mrs. Moreton had been ill pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; the linen I had made, the money I had lent, had, altogether, greatly contributed to reduce my finances, and I began to ſee the difficulties, in which this ungenerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct would involve me. At firſt, it ſtruck me, that Mr. Belger had been acceſſary to her departure; but in this I was deceived, for on calling there, I found they were as greatly ſurprized as I had been, and that her ſpecious appearance had ſo far impoſed on him, that he had lent her twenty guineas only a few days before. Overwhelm'd with this new affliction, I returned to my lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but judge if you poſſibly can, of my increaſed anguiſh, when, on entering my bed-chamber, I ſaw my bureau had been forced open, all my caſh gone, and with it a quantity of edging to a large amount. Almoſt ready to ſink with the terror that ſeized my mind, I rang the bell violently, and nobody immediately anſwering, I ran down to Mrs. Newtram's apartments and
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:029439_0264_0FE114D92E662898"/>
enquired after Kitty. "Bleſs me, Miſs How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard," ſaid Mrs. Newtram, "did you not diſcharge her before you went out this morning." "No, indeed I had not the moſt diſtant thought of ſuch a thing."</p>
                     <p>"Well, that's ſtrange now; for you had not been out above five minutes, before ſhe came down crying, and begged one of the apprentices to go for a coach, ſaid you had diſcharged her at a moment's warning, but ſhe would go directly home to her mother. When the coach came, we helped her in with her boxes, and ſhe drove away, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the man to ſtop at the White Horſe Cellar, Piccadilly."</p>
                     <p>"I'm undone," ſaid I, "what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of me;" and ſunk almoſt fainting, into a chair. Mrs. Newtram got me ſome hartſhorn and water, after which I began to ſhed tears, which in ſome meaſure reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me. "Dear Miſs," cried Mrs. New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram, "what can have happened: have you loſt any of your friends?" "Oh!" ſaid I, "I have no friends; I am the moſt unfortunate creature breathing, nor do I know how to extricate myſelf from the difficulties that ſurround me."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="90" facs="unknown:029439_0265_0FE114DE68D02A78"/>
I then gave her an account of Mrs. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's departure, of the money, &amp;c. I had truſted her with, and concluded with the diſcovery I had juſt made of Kitty's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty.</p>
                     <p>"Why to be ſure Miſs Howard," ſaid ſhe, "it is a ſad loſs; but you ſhould have been upon your guard againſt Mrs. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; you certainly knew ſhe was a woman of dubious character; and to tell you the truth, Mr. Newtram and I have often ſaid it was a great pity, ſo ſweet a young lady ſhould be ſo intimate, with a woman of that kind: then there is Mrs. Belger, why all the world knows ſhe is no better than ſhe ſhould be; and you can't think what ill natured things have been ſaid in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, about your being ſo much with them."</p>
                     <p>"As to Mrs. Moreton," ſaid I, "be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, I had not the leaſt idea, but that ſhe was a woman of reſpectable character; and tho' I have heard ſome things, not quite ſo much to Mrs. Belger's advantage, I never ſaw a woman in my life whoſe whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct demanded more reſpect and eſteem." "Upon my word Miſs," ſaid ſhe, "I am ſurprized to hear you talk ſo, when you know (drawing up her head) Mr. Belger
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:029439_0266_0FE114E12CD65138"/>
is not her huſband; but that I have a very good opinion of you, I ſhould think you was as bad as ſhe."</p>
                     <p>"I think, Mrs. Newtram," ſaid I, "as you ſeem to know Mrs. Moreton's character ſo well it would have been but friendly to have given me a little warning."</p>
                     <p>"Why, la! Miſs, you know it was no buſineſs of mine, and you told me yourſelf you knew her before you came to ſettle here: but, how do you mean to do? I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you have ſome friends to whom you can apply; if you have any letter, or any thing to ſend to town one of our young men ſhall take it."</p>
                     <p>"I tell you again Mrs. Newtram, I have not a friend in the world; I am a poor ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary being, unconnected with the world, or any one in it; and were I this moment to leave it, not one tear of affection or regret would be ſhed upon my grave."</p>
                     <p>"Dear now that's very odd, moſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have ſome friend or other, but I ſuppoſe you have offended all your's." "They are dead," ſaid I, "and unleſs you favour me with your advice and aſſiſtance, I know not to whom elſe to apply." "To be ſure, I'll
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:029439_0267_0FE114E6B6C22C58"/>
give you the beſt advice in my power, but had you not better apply to Mr. Belger?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh no, I would wiſh to hide my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs from him in particular." "You are in debt? I ſuppoſe," aſked Mrs. Newtram, in a quick accent.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, I owe above forty guineas." "Well, and there is a quarter's rent of the lodging due, that's eight more, then there's the laundreſs and the baker." "True," ſaid I, in an humble tone, "but I ſuppoſe my furniture will ſell for as much as will pay them." "And is that all your depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance? then I ſhall take care that we looſe nothing: here, Newtram," continued ſhe, opening a door that looked into the ſhop, "here, ſtep here:" when he came in, ſhe told him my ſituation and concluded, "then you know, as that is the caſe, we had better take care of ourſelves, and be the firſt to take the furniture."</p>
                     <p>"That's true dame," ſaid he, "ſo d'ye ſee, Miſs, we'll ſend for a man to 'praiſe the goods to-morrow."</p>
                     <p>Aſtoniſhment almoſt ſuſpended my facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: "juſt heaven!" ſaid I, "is this friendſhip?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="unknown:029439_0268_0FE114E9AABB06A0"/>
"Friendſhip," ſaid ſhe, tartly, "I have a large family Miſs, and all my friendſhip muſt be exerted for my children: if I was inclined to give you the eight guineas you owe me I cannot do it in juſtice to theſe little innocents."</p>
                     <p>Celia, ſhe pointed to the two children I had ſaved from the fire: I fixed my eyes on the unoffending infants, a freſh flood of tears burſt from them, I folded my hands upon my boſom and remained ſilent.</p>
                     <p>It was now one o'clock and the ſervant brought in their dinner; they ſat down to table, but did not aſk me to partake, I ſhould not have noticed the impropriety of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in their apartment, had I not been rouſed from my ſtupefaction by the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt girl, who getting from her ſeat brought her plate of victuals and laid it in my lap, and taking up a bit put it towards my mouth crying, "there Miſſy eat ſome dinnee." I kiſſed the dear child, and apologizing for my intruſion went up to my apartment; where I vented my full heart, in an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained flood of tears.</p>
                     <p>Toward evening Betty came into my room; ſhe ſaid her miſtreſs was gone out, and ſhe had ſtolen up unknown to her maſter
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:029439_0269_0FE1157066D8D6E8"/>
to ſee if ſhe could do any thing for me. "You have had no dinner," ſaid the kind girl, "pray let me get you ſome tea." She then made up the ſire, and preſently provided this repaſt, which however diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inclined, I forced myſelf to take, to eaſe poor Betty's anxiety. When ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the tea things and lighted a candle, ſhe went down ſtairs again, and I ſat penſive and ſolitary, retracing the paſt events of my life. Alas! ſaid I, how very hard is my fate. Poſſeſſed as I am of a heart moulded to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, glowing with univerſal affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my fellow creatures, I am conſtantly thrown among people, whoſe every feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap>bed in ſelf. Yet ſure huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is the child of nature; it is a heavenly ſpark of intellectual fire, implanted in our ſouls by the hand divine. Every heart is endowed with it more or leſs; but an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the world contributes to blunt thoſe keen ſenſations, till by degrees they are entirely deadened, and we can look on a ſcene of miſery without the leaſt emotion, if it interferes not with our own intereſt or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Yet I cannot think that I ſhall ever arrive at that happy ſtate of torpidity, for ſure, while I can feel my own ſorrows, I ſhall never be inſenſible to the woes of others; for never yet did I ſee a perſon in affliction, but I made their caſe my own, and my heart would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:029439_0270_0FE114EF52A57BB8"/>
overflow with pity. But alas! no heart melts with pity for me. Even Mrs. Newtram ſeems to have forgot that ſhe has daughters, or ſhe would ſurely compaſſionate my ſufferings, by reflecting that thoſe darl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of her heart may perhaps one day be in the ſame ſituation. I was ſtill purſuing this melancholy train of thought, when I was ſtartled by a gentle tap at the door. I aroſe and opened it, but was ſurpriſed to ſee Mr. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger enter the room. "Dear Miſs Howard," ſaid he, "forgive this liberty. I have been informed of your diſtreſs by your officious landlady, whom I have left chattering to to Mrs. Belger, while I ſlipped away to offer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ny aſſiſtance in my power to my charming little friend." I bowed my head, but could not anſwer. I motioned towards a chair. He ſeated himſelf and continued: "My dear Meriel, I have long feared what is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alized; I knew from the firſt moment I ſaw you, that you were never deſigned for the ſtation, in which you have lately moved. The elegance of your manner, the delicacy of your ſentiments convince me you are far ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to thoſe women with whom it has been your misfortune to be obliged to aſſociate." "Indeed, Mr. Belger," ſaid I, "I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of that ſuperioty in nothing but miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I look round me with a deſponding eye,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:029439_0271_0FE114F3FA16A6B8"/>
and think the world does not contain ſo friendleſs, ſo wretched a creature as myſelf."</p>
                     <p>"From my ſoul do I pity you," ſaid he, taking my hand, "and wiſh it was in my power effectually to ſerve you without offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing that might alarm your ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but that is impoſſible. I know of but one method, by which you can be extricated from your preſent difficulties." "Alas, ſir," I replied, "I have not the leaſt hope of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extricated. All my furniture will be ſeized to-morrow, and I ſhall be turned from this habitation without knowing how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide another."</p>
                     <p>"Not ſo, beloved girl," ſaid he. "You cannot think I will ſuffer it. Long have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

You muſt have ſeen my ardent affection, which has ſo often burſt thro' the thin veil, prudence obliged me to throw over it; and if vanity has not miſled me, I flatter myſelf I am not altogether indifferent to you; if ſo, my dear creature, what remains, but that we this night bid adieu to all theſe vexations? Let us defy the malignant cenſures of the world, and happy in each other's affections, riſe ſuperior to the narrow bounds impoſed by prieſt-craft and ſuperſtition; dare to think and act for ourſelves, and ſeek that

                     <p>Amazement had taken entire poſſeſſion of me during this ſpeech; I was almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deprived of the power of utterance. At length I exclaimed "good God! how have I deſerved this inſult? Ungenerous man, have you forgot Mrs. Belger."</p>
                     <p>"Dear Meriel," ſaid he, "do not raiſe imaginary obſtacles. You as well as all the reſt of the world know I am not married to that woman."</p>
                     <p>"But you are bound to her, ſir, by every tie of honour and gratitude."</p>
                     <p>"Miſs Howard," ſaid he, gravely, "can you lay your hand upon your heart, and ſay you do not regard me with a ſentiment more lively than friendſhip."</p>
                     <p>"If I know that heart, Mr. Belger, it will never love whom it cannot eſteem. And whatever may be its feeling I have learnt to conquer." I could not finiſh what I intended to ſay, my tears flowed ſo faſt they almoſt choaked me.</p>
                     <p>

"Deareſt, gentleſt girl," ſaid he, "I ſee the tenderneſs you vainly ſtrive to hide, then come let us fly to France and inſure at once both your own happineſs and mine."</p>
                     <p>"What will become of your Emma," ſaid I, "Can you reſolve to forſake your child?"</p>
                     <p>"Thank you, my ſweet girl, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, ſhe ſhall be the companion of our flight."</p>
                     <p>"And ſo drive her poor mother to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. No, Mr. Belger, never ſhall it be ſaid of Meriel Howard, that ſhe had by her perfidy placed a dagger in the heart of an innocent woman; nor ſhall you forget this confiding, affectionate woman. Has ſhe not ſacrificed every conſideration to you, friends, reputation, all that can render life deſirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If ſhe is not your wife, ſhe ought to have been ſo long ſince. And tho' you were dearer to me than the vital tide that nouriſhes my heart, that heart ſhould break rather than injure her. In the midſt of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and diſtreſs, if I can preſerve my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity unſhaken, I ſhall ſtill have one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, of which no earthly power can deprive me."

"Unkind girl to treat me thus, when it was my intention to extricate you from theſe impending difficulties and placed you in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence." "You would have degraded me to infamy, I thank your generoſity."</p>
                     <p>"By heavens! Miſs Howard I will marry you." "No, Mr. Belger, that would be only uſing the ſacred ceremony as a cloak to perfidy and deceit. Leave me, ſir, my reſolution is fixed, and not the crueleſt tortures poverty and its attendant evils can inflict ſhall tempt me to alter it." I then broke from him, and going into an inner apartment faſtened the door, and waited till I was certain he had left the houſe.</p>
                     <p>Tho' I now found myſelf plunged in the moſt miſerable ſituation, I felt a ſecret ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in reflecting I had acted with propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in regard to Mr. Belger, as reaſon plainly pointed out how little hope there could be of felicity with a man, who could, guided merely by the caprice of paſſion, forſake a woman ſo faithful, and ſo tender as Mrs. Belger. Religion alſo told me, how little I ſhould deſerve, ſhould I be ſo ſelfiſh as to fix the baſis of my own proſperity, on the miſery of a fellow creature, "Almighty Father," ſaid I, "aſſiſt me with thy grace that I may be enabled to perform my duty

I breathed this ſhort prayer as I retired to bed, a ſweet ſerenity came over my mind, and I enjoyed a profound ſleep till near eight the next morning.

                     <p>I JUDGE of my dear Celia's impatience, by what I ſhould feel where ſhe in the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation in which I was, when I concluded my laſt: I will not trifle with you, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in my narrative. The next morning I aroſe and went down ſtairs to Mr. Newtram, told him I was ready to admit the perſons he had mentioned into the apartment to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the furniture, and hoped there would be more than ſufficient to pay all I owed: I was continuing to ſpeak to him, when turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my head I ſaw the laceman enter the ſhop. He pretended not to know my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho' I am certain he had been ſent for by Newtram, and told me a long ſtory, to which I paid but little attention, about hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a large ſum to make up, &amp;c. I deſired him to wait a little while, and I made no
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:029439_0277_0FE11510D6599E60"/>
doubt but I ſhould have ſufficient to diſcharge his bill. Alas! my Celia, I did not at that time think of the vaſt difference between ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and buying. I knew the little furniture I poſſeſſed, together with what Mr. Welldon had given me, had coſt more than ſixty pounds and were at preſent nearly as good as new. But when the man had looked them over, and taken an inventory, he offered me only thirty five guineas for the whole, in which was included my piano forte. I urged how much more they had coſt me, and how little they had been uſed. He anſwered that was nothing to him; he could afford to give no more; there were ſome things would be of no uſe to him; they would lay a dead ſtock upon his hands, and if I did not chooſe to take that, it was all very well, he had rather leave them than have them.</p>
                     <p>What could I do? I found I muſt either ſell them or go to priſon, and tho' I knew not by what means to ſupport life, liberty had ſtill ſome charms for me. I took the money, and turning toward my creditors, for by this time they were all aſſembled, laid the money on the table, and deſired Mr. Newtram to pay them all as far as it would go; but they were not to be ſatisfied with this. "You have good cloaths, Miſs Howard," ſaid New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram, "you cannot expect poor people will
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:029439_0278_0FE1151650089D40"/>
ſet down quietly with their loſs, and ſuffer you to go off with a trunk full of finery." "Alas! ſir," ſaid I, "the cloaths you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are ſo few and compoſed of ſuch indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent materials, I did not think they would be of any value but to the owner. There are ſome few pices of edging, ſir," continued I, turning to the laceman, "which I muſt beg of you to take again." My trunks were now brought down ſtairs. Mrs. Newtram choſe out the beſt of my gowns, linen, &amp;c. which were ſet down at leſs than half their value: the edgings were produced, when to my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſtoniſhment, the laceman declared he would not take them without an allowance of one third of what I had paid him for them only a few months before.</p>
                     <p>At length all demands were diſcharged, my furniture taken away, and myſelf left ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary in the empty rooms: I went down ſtairs and delivered up the keys. I had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but weep all day, and had taken no kind of nouriſhment ſince my breakfaſt, and it was now four o'clock in the afternoon. Mrs. Newtram did not aſk me to ſit down; but when I left the parlour I felt myſelf ſo ſick and faint that I was obliged to ſit down on the foot of the ſtairs, where my feelings became ſo poignant that I thought I ſhould have been ſuffocated. Poor Betty came to
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:029439_0279_0FE1151A9E3D1AA8"/>
me, and endeavoured to comfort me, but her own ſobs were ſo audible as to prevent my underſtanding what ſhe ſaid: In a few moments Mrs. Newtram came out of the parlour. "Dear me, Miſs Howard," ſaid ſhe, "you will make yourſelf quite ill with fretting, and then, what is to become of you; come, come, cheer up, all will be well again, by and by; one of our young men will call you a coach, you don't conſider how ſoon it is dark this time of the year." "I don't want a coach," ſaid I, "there is nothing very heavy to carry; I will tye up a few things in a handkerchief and leave the reſt till I have ſome ſettled place of abode, when I will ſend for them." "But it's a wet evening, child," ſaid ſhe, "and a long walk to town." "No matter, I will not have a coach." "Perhaps, Miſs Howard, you will be affronted, but if you cannot pay for one, accept theſe five ſhillings."</p>
                     <p>Celia, this vile oſtentation, this ſhew of generoſity, after ſhe had ſtripped me of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every thing, awakened my reſentment. "No, Mrs. Newtram," ſaid I, "if I am obliged to borrow money, I have a few more cloaths left, on which I imagine I can raiſe it; but at preſent I have a few ſhillings, which is ſufficient for this evening, to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row I will ſend for my cloaths." She flung
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:029439_0280_0FE1151FB43E3CB0"/>
into the parlour, muttering ſomething about ingratitude, pride and poverty. It was a cold rainy evening, the latter end of October, when with a ſmall bundle in my hand, and a load of grief at my heart, I ſet forward on foot from Kenſington; I had not proceeded far before I heard a quick ſtep behind me, and preſently was accoſted by Mr. Belger.</p>
                     <p>"Where are you going my dear crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this cold, wet night?" "I am going to town, ſir, and am in haſte." "Where ſhall you lodge in town?" "Indeed, I do not know." "My dear Miſs Howard, you are I fear more diſtreſſed than you are will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to confeſs, believe me I am your friend, confide in me, I will not ſuffer you to want any aſſiſtance in my power to give; but we cannot conveniently conſult what is beſt to be done, thus in the open ſtreet; ſtep into this houſe, (we were juſt oppoſite an houſe of entertainment,) I have ordered my car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage here to take me up, and when we have had a cup of tea we will proceed to town together."</p>
                     <p>"No, ſir," ſaid I, "it is to no purpoſe to ſolicit me, I am determined to go on to town immediately." "Than let me call a coach, my dear girl, you muſt not be thus expoſed to the inclemency of the weather."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="106" facs="unknown:029439_0281_0FE1152284ECA2A8"/>
"Mr. Belger, if you wiſh me to believe you my friend, leave me, nor thus increaſe my almoſt inſupportable load of anguiſh, by making offers which I neither can nor will accept." "Then let me have the pleaſure of ſupplying you with caſh till it is in your power to repay me." This too I obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſed, and the rain juſt then increaſing, he ceaſed his ſolicitations after ſaying I ſhould always find a friend in him, he left me to purſue my uncomfortable walk. It was near ſeven o'clock, when I arrived in town, with only a few ſhillings in my pocket no friend to apply to and entirely at a loſs how to diſpoſe of myſelf that night, as the people in London are fearful of taking ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into their houſes, without a proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation; not having ſufficient reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to apply to any houſe for a lodging I kept walking on till I came to the ſtrand, where, juſt as I was paſſing a large haberdaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's ſhop, a carriage overturned, the horſes took fright, and I ran with many others into the ſhop, for ſafety; I had not been there above five minutes, before I heard a female voice exclaim, good God! can it be? yes, I am certain it is Miſs Howard; the lady had now come cloſe up to me, and on raiſing my eyes, I beheld Amelia Sidney a young lady whom I had once or twice ſeen at my aunts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="107" facs="unknown:029439_0282_0FE11528070C4E58"/>
Shall I confeſs, that ſhame at being ſeen in ſo draggled a condition was the firſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation I felt, however, Amelia ſoon made me forget that, when kindly taking my hand in the ſoft voice of affection, ſhe ſaid, "my dear Miſs Howard, where have you hid yourſelf all this time;" then obſerving my wet cloak and bonnet, ſhe continued: "You have been walking in the rain my love, I have a coach waiting, give me leave to ſet you down wherever you wiſh to go." The ſoothing voice of tenderneſs as ſoon wrings tears from the afflicted heart, as does the churliſh voice of chiding, but then the one drops gently, while the ſofteſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations pervade the ſoul, the other is the ſource of ſuch real anguiſh, that memory will retain the pain they occaſion for years afterwards.</p>
                     <p>I could not anſwer the kind miſs Sidney, but followed her in ſilence to the coach, when we were ſeated ſhe again renewed her queſtion, "where will you be ſet down?" The anguiſh of my heart now burſt out, and I cried, I have no home: all places are alike to me, "then you ſhall go home with me," ſaid Amelia. "Oh Miſs Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney," ſaid I, "do not think by thus accpt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your kind offer of ſtepping into the coach I mean to throw myſelf on your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:029439_0283_0FE1152C85423100"/>
my only motive was to have an opportunity of enquiring whether you could recommend me to any place, where I might lodge for a little time, till I could conſider how to diſpoſe of myſelf in future. Favour me with your advice, dear lady, for indeed I have no friends in the world, who intereſts themſelves the leaſt in my welfare." She preſſed my hand and after ſoftly ſaying, "be comfored, my dear," remained ſilent, till the coach ſtopped, ſhe then aſſiſted me to alight, and leading me up ſtairs left me a few moments in the drawing room; but ſoon returned with her mother. Mrs. Sidney received me with the chearful ſmile of an old friend, and Amelia brought a change of cloaths which ſhe inſiſted on my putting on. Supper ſoon came in. The manner which Mrs. Sidney and her daughter obſerved towards me, was delicate and attentive in the extreme. Not a word ſcaped them that had the leaſt appearance of curioſity; they ſeemed to treat me as tho' I had been paying an expected viſit, and to conſider my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as an obligation; when the cloath was removed, I told my amiable hoſteſs, I thought it but right ſhe ſhould know by what means I became reduced to ſo diſtreſt a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but Amelia ſtopped me. "Dear Miſs Howard," ſaid ſhe, "if it is in our power to ſerve you, do not heſitate to point out
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:029439_0284_0FE11531E8CFAD78"/>
the way, and you will not find us backward in performing it; but I inſiſt that you do not enter into explanations which may be painful to you. You have no doubt been unfortunate, as ſuch and knowing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of your heart, you have a claim upon my friendſhip, I am ready to prove myſelf your ſincere well wiſher, but I have no right to enter into a minute inveſtigation of your paſt conduct." "But, my dear lady," ſaid I, "it is abſolutely neceſſary, you ſhould be acquainted with many paſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of my life, that you may better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve my preſent ſituation and be enabled to favour me with your advice, for my future conduct. "Well, my dear," ſaid Mrs. Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, "whatever you think proper," "I thank heaven madam," ſaid I, "tho' I ſhall ſhall acquaint you with many errors, ſome of which I tremble but to think on, (for at that moment, Celia, I remembered my impious deſpondency, and the divine interpoſition of providence which delivered me at the very moment, when to avoid temporal miſery I was ruſhing into guilt.) Yet I have done nothing to make me aſhamed, and tho' my reputation has been ſullied. "We have all our errors, Miſs Howard," ſaid Amelia, "and we all hope to have thoſe errors forgiven, then ſhould we not be always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to forgive the errors of our fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:029439_0285_0FE1153658128190"/>
Come my dear girl let me perſuade you to drop the ſubject, whatever have been your errors I am ſure you now renounce them, and whatever are your misfortunes we will ſtrive to aleviate, if we cannot entirely remove them." "You are very good, Miſs Sidney, but give me leave to proceed, I will not detain you long." I then in as few words as poſſible compriſed the whole of my ſufferings, not even endeavouring to veil my errors, from the time of my father's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, till the preſent day; ſhe liſtened with attention, and taking my hand ſaid, "Conviction ſits on your countenance, I will not doubt your relation, my dear Meriel, becauſe it has been delivered with ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious frankneſs that to hear is to believe; but you have been ſtrangely miſrepreſented, by thoſe whoſe duty it was to defend rather than aſperſe your character." She then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me that the Moſſops had propogated the moſt malignant cenſures againſt me, and from at firſt pointing me out as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ridicule to entertain their friends, at length repreſented me as fit only for their contempt. In ſhort, folly, ignorance, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, and profligacy, had been ſet forward, as the moſt ſtriking traits in my character, and at the very moment when Amelia met me, ſhe ſuppoſed me ſunk into infamy and ſhame. "But," ſaid ſhe, "I ſaw you was
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:029439_0286_0FE1153B6D5BD8D0"/>
unhappy, and I know it is our duty not to remember the faults, when an opportunity offers, wherein we may be of ſervice to a perſon in diſtreſs, I am now more than ever convinced of the propriety of ſuch a mode of conduct, for had I not acted thus, I ſhould never have known how much Miſs Howard had been injured, and how little her unworthy friends deſerved ſuch a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but I beg," continued ſhe, "you will conſider yourſelf at home. Believe me, you are as welcome as a ſiſter, and whenever you hear of a ſituation which you think will ſuit you, my mother and I will give you every neceſſary recommendation, but do not be in a hurry to leave us, we ſhall not ſoon be tired of your company."</p>
                     <p>She then ſhewed me to a neat bed-chamber adjoining her own, and wiſhing me a good nights repoſe, left me. And who is this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent girl? methinks I hear you ſay. She is, my dear Celia, the daughter of a man, who by induſtry in a reſpectable line of buſineſs, brought up a numerous family in a reputable manner. He lived to ſee his ſons well ſettled in the world, and had ſaved enough to leave at his death, Mrs. Sidney and this, his only daughter a comfortable independence. Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia had a genteel, but yet uſeful education, ſhe was equally qualified to ſhine in public or
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:029439_0287_0FE1154047F3DF98"/>
private life, ſhe preferred the latter. Her mother's happineſs conſtituted her own, ſhe read to her, worked with her, conſidered her peace as the main ſpring for all her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and loved her with a tender reſpect bordering on devotion. Yet with a pleaſing graceful perſon, a lively diſpoſition, and a large ſhare of good ſenſe, has this amiable girl reached her twety-fifth year, without one offer of marriage, ſhe has had many lovers, but ſhe declares they all deſerted their colours, when they underſtood, ſhe would have no fortune till the death of her mother. "So you ſee, my dear," ſaid ſhe, one day ſmiling "I am deſtined to wear the willow as long as I live." More ſhame for the male world if ſhe is, Celia, for I think I could venture to pronounce him a happy man, who ſhould be ſo fortunate as to obtain ſuch a wife.</p>
                     <p>I have been in this kind family, now near a month, but have not as yet heard of any thing, that I think will ſuit, tho' I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to take almoſt any ſituation rather than remain a burthen upon the benevolence of Amelia and her mother; who, tho' they have ſufficient for all the comforts and ſome of the elegancies of life, I am ſure, cannot afford to have me conſtantly with them. I ſent for the reſt of my cloaths the day after I left Kenſington, but received no meſſage
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:029439_0288_0FE1154562F40B38"/>
from thence, nor have I heard a ſyllable of Mr. Belger, I hope you will grant me the credit of not wiſhing it. I even gave the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who went for my things a ſtrict charge, not to mention in what part of the town I reſided.</p>

                     <p>A lady called this evening at Mrs. Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's, who ſaid ſhe had heard of a place which ſhe thought would ſuit me: it is to be companion to an elderly lady in the country, to read to her, walk with her help entertain her company and attend a little to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic concerns of the family. The ſalary, I find, is but ſmall, that ſhall be no objection, I never was extravagant in dreſs, and I think I ſhall hardly begin now. I am to go to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row morning at ten o'clock to ſpeak to a lady, who is a diſtant relation of Mrs. Rookſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and who has been deſired by her to look out for the kind of perſon ſhe wants. I wiſh I may be ſo lucky as to ſucceed in this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, as I truſt I could render myſelf agreeable to the old lady, and I would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe exert myſelf to be uſeful. The mail goes to-morrow, before I ſhall have time to write again, but my Celia, may depend on my ſeizing the firſt opportunity, to let her know my ſucceſs.

                     <p>The morning after I ſent off my laſt, my dear Celia, I dreſſed myſelf neat but very
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:029439_0291_0FE115547219C670"/>
plain, and at ten o'clock found myſelf at the door of Mr. Kingly, in Golden ſquare, the ſervant, who opened it, told me his lady was not come down: he begged I would wait in a parlour, where there was a fire, and brought me a newſpaper to amuſe me. In about twenty minutes, he returned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to walk up ſtairs. I followed him into a back drawing room, where an elegant woman ſat preparing to make tea, and a nurſe was in the room with a very young child. The lady aroſe and received me with every mark of politeneſs; but I was ſcarcely ſeated before a voice ſtruck my ears, which vibrated to my throbbing heart, I felt my face glow, but had not a moment for thought, before the door opened, and Rainsforth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the room holding a boy about twelve months old in his arms. Surpriſe threw me entirely off my guard, I gave a ſudden ſhriek and fainted.</p>
                     <p>What paſſed during my indiſpoſition I cannot tell, but when I recovered, I found the lady ſitting beſide me on the ſopha, applying volatiles to my noſe and temples, while a maid ſervant ſtood by with water, but neither Rainsforth or the children were in the room. "Are you ſubject to theſe ill turns, my dear <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

ſometimes ſerve me thus." "Do you know Mr. Kingly? Was it his preſence that cauſed ſuch violent emotions?" "Only that you call him Kingly, madam, I ſhould ſay the gentleman who came in juſt now was a Mr. Rainsforth, of Plymouth." "Is your name Howard?" ſaid the lady viſibly agitated. I anſwered in the affirmative. "Then," ſaid ſhe, "I can account for the exclamation with which he left the room. You are right in your conjectures Miſs Howard, Rains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth and Kingly are one and the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. He took my name on our union, of which I ſuppoſe you were unacquainted. "I was indeed, a ſtranger to it, madam, or I ſhould not have preſumed to have intruded here; pardon the involuntary confuſion I have occaſioned, and permit me to retire." "You are not as yet ſufficiently recovered," ſaid ſhe, "to venture out. Pray, ſtop, and compoſe yourſelf, and if it will not occaſion a return of your diſorder, we will ſend for Mr. Kingly to take his breakfaſt." I was beginning to apologize for the diſagreeable interruption I had given, but ſhe ſtopped me. "I ſhall not liſten to a ſyllable of excuſe. I am ſure it was unintentional, but I will not forgive it on any other terms than its never being mentioned in future."</p>

                        <pb n="118" facs="unknown:029439_0293_0FE1155E500ED700"/>
Kingly, as I muſt henceforth call him, was now ſummoned to breakfaſt, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to command my countenance; but I fear to little effect; I attempted to riſe, when he entered the room, but my limbs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed their office. He bowed and took his ſeat in ſilence, a cup of tea was handed him: his hand trembled ſo he could not raiſe it to his mouth.

Mrs. Kingly ſeemed the leaſt embarraſſed of the three, and at length ventured to ſay, "my dear Kingly you forget your politeneſs to day, pray help Miſs Howard to ſome muffin." "I believe," ſaid he, "it is by ſome other name we muſt addreſs this lady now." Surpriſe at what he uttered tempted me to raiſe my eyes with a kind of inquiſitive look." "My name is ſtill Howard," ſaid I, "nor have the leaſt intention of altering it." "Were you not on the point of being married about two years ſince?" I was more aſtoniſhed than ever at this queſtion. I knew not what to anſwer: to have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned any thing of my intended union with Kingly before his wife, would perhaps have only ſerved to make her unhappy. At length I anſwered, I was, it is true, near being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:029439_0294_0FE115648C197920"/>
about that time, but I had every reaſon to ſuppoſe you, as well as the reſt of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, knew the cauſe of the match being broke off. I have never had a thought ſince of altering my condition. "It is very ſtrange," ſaid he, and the converſation drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. I then began to recollect the reaſon which had brought me to the houſe of a man whom I wiſhed, of all others, moſt to avoid, and turning to Mrs. Kingly made the neceſſary enquiries concerning the place I wanted to engage for. Having received an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers greatly to my ſatisfaction, I aroſe to take my leave, referring her to Mrs. Sidney for my character. "I dare ſay there will be no neceſſity to make thoſe enquiries," ſaid ſhe, "but if you will mention any day when you will favour me with your company to dinner, I will introduce you to my aunt, who is fortunately now in town."</p>
                     <p>I told her if ſhe would favour me ſo far, as to give me a line to Mrs. Rookſby, I would wait on that lady at any time ſhe would pleaſe to appoint, but muſt beg leave to decline the propoſed honour of dining with her, as I feared it would not be poſſible to diſengage myſelf from the kind friends with whom I at preſent reſided, till an abſolute ſettlement obliged me to leave them. Indeed, my dear Celia, I felt there would be a great impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:029439_0295_0FE1156A7AE92958"/>
in endeavouring to cultivate an intimacy with Mrs. Kingly, for ſhould ſhe not have been acquainted with the connection that formerly ſubſiſted between her huſband and myſelf, and ſhould by any means hereafter hear of it, ſhe might naturally ſuppoſe I cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated her acquaintance, that I might the more eaſily enjoy her huſband's ſociety; and if, as I ſuſpect, ſhe already knows how near we were being united by the tendereſt ties, ſhe would certainly approve a conduct, which would ſhew how much her happineſs was preferred to my own gratification. I will confeſs I wiſhed for nothing more than a converſation with Kingly, for I plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome myſtery couched beneath the few ſentences that paſſed, while we were at breakfaſt: But this wiſh I was ſenſible would be both improper and imprudent to ſeek to gratify. Mrs. Kingly having therefore nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a day, when ſhe thought it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for her aunt to ſee me, and menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned an hour when ſhe would call and take me to her, I took my leave. I ſlightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded Kingly's countenance, as I wiſhed him good morning, and diſcovered in it ſtrong traits <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

<pb n="121" facs="unknown:029439_0296_0FE10841ECD80E88"/>
any concealments from ſuch worthy friends, I therefore briefly related all that concerned Rainsforth, and my unfortunate rencounter with him that morning. "Upon my word, Meriel," ſaid ſhe, "every word you utter excites freſh wonder. I remember hearing of the affair you mention, but it was always ſpoken of in ſuch a ludicrous ſtrain, that I have myſelf frequently joined in the laugh againſt you, conſidering you as a poor, fond girl, who fancied every man who but ſpoke a civil word was in love with you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned this imaginary paſſion with all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic ardor of romantic affection." I made Miſs Sidney no anſwer, but going to my trunk, returned with all the letters which had paſſed between Rainsforth and myſelf. "This proof of your fortitude and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity," ſaid ſhe, when ſhe had peruſed them, "was only wanting to complete my eſteem for your character; for, it is from theſe letters only, that I have learnt in what manner you diſpoſed of your fortune. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, noble ſpirited girl, it is only for ſuch hearts as yours to be tried in the ordeal of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; but ſurely heaven has ſome future reward in ſtore, that will amply compenſate the ſufferings you are ordained to endure."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! my dear Amelia," ſaid I, "have I not already an ample compenſation in your
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:029439_0297_0FE115781CDE6568"/>
friendſhip and affection. Praiſes from your lips are balm to my wounded heart: may I never forfeit your eſteem." "That I am ſure you never will. I only bluſh to think how long I remained a ſtranger to your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; but the real diamond is always enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped in a cruſt, thro' which it is only on near inſpection, we can diſcover its intrinſic value." "Ah! flatterer," ſaid I, ſmiling, while the tear of grateful affection ſtole from my eye. Oh! Celia, when I forget the friendſhip of Amelia Sidney, the benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from her hands, the miſery from which ſhe ſnatched me, may I be forgot by that Providence to whom we can only look for ſupport. Bleſs her, all-bounteous hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; make her felicity as boundleſs as the benevolence of her heart; let her comforts be many, and her afflictions few: and when this tranſitory ſcene is paſt, ſoft and gentle be her paſſage to the grave.

endeavour to ſee me, as his mind muſt be in the ſame ſtate of painful uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in regard to my conduct, as I was, when I reflected on his.

                     <p>The next morning Mrs. Kingly called as ſhe had appointed, and took me with her in the chariot to Mrs. Rookſby. This old
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:029439_0301_0FE1159122D77AB8"/>
lady is extremely pleaſing in her manner. Her perſon, tho' advanced in years, retains many traces of grace and elegance. She expreſſed her approbation of me, in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteſt terms, and ſaid, ſhe ſhould conſider herſelf extremely fortunate in the acquiſition of ſuch a companion. Her terms were much more liberal than I had been led to expect; and as we were ſoon agreed, ſhe requeſted me to appoint an early day for my removal to her houſe. "Buſineſs of a very particular nature," ſaid ſhe, "required my preſence in London, which I have not viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before for upwards of twenty years, nor ſhall I now remain in it long; but while I do ſtay, I ſhall wiſh to enter into a few of its amuſements, and I am certain I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive double ſatiſfaction from them all, when I am favoured with your company." It was then determined, that day week ſhould be the time of my removal, and we took our leave. When I was again in the carriage with Mrs. Kingly, ſhe ſaid, "it gives me great pleaſure to find my aunt is likely to make ſo agreeable an addition to her family; nor have I the leaſt doubt, but you will be ſatisfied with your ſituation, as ſhe is a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of an eaſy, chearful diſpoſition. And now my dear Miſs Howard, as we have ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled this important buſineſs, you muſt give me leave to execute a commiſſion, I yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:029439_0302_0FE11596A8B96E28"/>
undertook. I have a letter for you," continued ſhe, ſmiling. "You may perhaps gueſs from whom. Come, no drawing back, I can aſſure you there will not be the leaſt impropriety in your recieving it, and I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf I have intereſt ſufficient to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an anſwer." She then put the letter into my hand. You may judge my confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. It was impoſſible to ſpeak, for I was utterly at a loſs what to ſay. I believe, I never looked more like a fool. Mrs. King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaw my embarraſſment, and kindly, did not ſeem to expect me to ſpeak, but began a converſation on things quite foreign to the ſubject. When we arrived at Mrs. Sidney's door, ſhe refuſed to alight; but wiſhing me a good day, ſaid, ſhe ſhould expect to hear from me ſoon.</p>
                     <p>I ran up ſtairs to Amelia, and putting the letter into her hand, cried, open it, read it for me, for indeed I have not reſolution to read it myſelf. Encloſed my dear Celia, is a copy of the letter; alſo of one from Mrs. Kingly, in which it was encloſed; when you have peruſed them, I am ſure you will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with your poor friend, that ſuch merit as Rainsforth's, (for ſtill I love that name,) ſhould be ſevered from her, by the malice of thoſe, who could really reap no advantage from her diſappointment.

the motives, that inſtigated the Moſſops to practice ſuch an impoſition on us both, they are undoubtedly diſappointed; for from the time of Rainsforth's marriage with Miſs Kingly he carefully avoided all intercourſe with the family; the reaſons for which you will find in his letter.

                     <p>I FEEL, my dear Miſs Howard, that I am under an indiſpenſible neceſſity of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you, to requeſt you will attend to the explanation ſo ardently deſired by Mr. King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and from which your rigid ſenſe of propriety, urges you to recede: but in what manner ſhall I addreſs you, dear, amiable young lady, when I am ſenſible I have, tho' unknowingly, ſtepped between you and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Often have I heard your name, oft liſtened to your commendations, from lips which never ſpoke, but they conveyed plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to my heart.</p>
                     <p>My father's family lived in terms of the greateſt intimacy with that of Mr. Rains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth's; Frederic and myſelf were nearly of the ſame age, were frequently together, we
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:029439_0305_0FE115A6D45AE830"/>
learnt to dance at the ſame ſchool, and at our annual ball I was always ſelected for his partner. Our infantine attachment was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed by both our parents, and Frederic was often ſmilingly called my little huſband. As we increaſed in years, this attachment grew weaker on the part of Frederic, but in my boſom it gathered new ſtrength; the many good qualities ſo conſpicuous in the boy, became dignified virtues in the boſom of the man. I always wept when duty called him from his native place, and rejoiced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly at his return. When my uncle made me his heireſs, my parents began to ſhew ſome diſapprobation of my viſible par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality; and when I repeatedly refuſed the moſt ſplendid offers, treated my paſſion with a rigour, which ſerved only to make its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on my heart more indeliable. Juſt before old Mr. Rainsforth met with the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, which was, I underſtand, the firſt cauſe of your ſeparation from his ſon. I loſt both my parents within a very ſhort pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of each other, and became my own miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs: I know not how to proceed, I am at a loſs for words, in which I can acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a weakneſs, which I fear you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn; but anxious to reſtore peace to the boſom of Rainsforth and proſperity to his family; and perfectly unacquainted with his engagements to the amiable Miſs Howard,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:029439_0306_0FE115AC6FBCCF58"/>
I ſo far overſtepped the bounds preſcribed our ſex, as to write to him making a tender of myſelf and fortune: inſtead of writing an anſwer to this letter, he came himſelf, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me in the tendereſt manner for what he termed my generous deſigns in his favour; but declared his heart was under a prior engagement. He then expiated largely on the virtues of Miſs Howard, and declared, tho' for the preſent, fortune had placed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable barriers to obſtruct your union, he ſhould ever hold himſelf as bound to you, and while you remained ſingle, conſider himſelf not at liberty to marry any other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. He requeſted that tho' unable to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the offered honour of my hand, he might not be deprived of my friendſhip, and declared he ſhould always think on me with gratitude and affection.</p>
                     <p>From this time I ſedulouſly endeavoured to conquer a paſſion, which I found preyed upon my peace of mind, and when I heard of the fortune left his family flattered my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf I had ſucceeded: I ſincerely rejoiced in the proſpect of his felicity in an union with you, which he told me would now ſoon be completed: but one morning he came to me in viſible agitation, and taking my hand, cried, "dear Margaret, I am diſappointed in my tendereſt hopes, Meriel Howard is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried."
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:029439_0307_0FE115B14C5735D0"/>
I tried to perſuade him he had been miſinformed; but he ſaid there was no room for doubt, as it had been confirmed by your own hand. He now viſited me every day, and I will confeſs to you, I exerted myſelf to divert his melancholy; I in ſome meaſure ſucceeded; and one day as we were chatt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together on indifferent ſubjects, he ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly caught my hand and cried, "if my lovely friend would accept the offer of a heart that was once devoted to another, happineſs might yet be my portion; but I dare not indulge ſo ſweet a hope." I will not repeat to you, Miſs Howard, the many converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we had on this ſubject; ſuffice it to ſay we were ſoon united. From that happy moment, his tenderneſs, his aſſiduity, has every day increaſed: I ſaw his heart ſtill beat true to its firſt attachment; but I alſo ſaw his ſtruggles to ſuppreſs its emotions. He never indulged himſelf in talking of you, carefully avoiding every place where he might chance to hear your name mentioned. The violent agitation, which you was thrown into by his entering the room the other morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and an exclamation which broke from him, as he caught you, when you were falling to the ground, made me readily conceive who it was I had the honour to entertain. I felt for you both, more than I can expreſs: I had long been acquainted with your virtues, though a
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:029439_0308_0FE115B746F3BD48"/>
ſtranger to your perſon, and I wiſhed ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for power to alleviate ſufferings, of which I conſidered myſelf the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>I eaſily underſtood your generous motive for declining viſiting at my houſe. I eſteem, I venerate you for it, tho' I am certain no ill conſequence could enſue from an intimacy between two hearts ſo chaſte, ſo much under the guidance of religion and honour, as your's and Mr. Kingly's. The day after I firſt had the pleaſure of ſeeing you, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Mr. Kingly to be melancholy and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. I preſſed to know the cauſe. He was at firſt embarraſſed; at length he candidly told me he wiſhed much for a converſation with you, to clear up ſome myſteries which at preſent tormented him beyond meaſure; that he had called on you twice, but you ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely refuſed to ſee him. He then ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me your note, and aſked, if he were to write a few lines, whether I would prevail with you to read them, and grant him an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. I readily promiſed him to comply with this requeſt, and I hope, my dear Miſs Howard, you will by an anſwer, reſtore peace to his boſom; for I am well convinced, he will never be happy while he imagines you

                     <p>THAT you are ſtill unmarried, my dear Meriel, is to me the cauſe of great aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; that you are depreſſed in your circumſtances, and obliged to ſeek by ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude the neceſſary means to ſupport life, gives the accuteſt pangs to a heart, that ever wiſhed and would have rejoiced in your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.

I fear we have both been deceived; but why that deceit has been practiſed againſt us, I am at a loſs to think. I know you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were a favourite with the Moſſop's. They envied virtues they had not ſpirit to imitate; but why they ſhould thus labour to render two unoffending beings ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely miſerable, is altogether unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I have, my dear friend, (the bluſh of ſhame crimſons my cheek while I write it) but I have doubted your virtues. I have thought you falſe, capricious, light and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving: and much I fear, you have been taught to think me the vileſt of my ſex. But let me haſten to exculpate myſelf from ſo black a charge. Let me trace back to the time that even at this moment my ſoul ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to think upon.

I was haſtily preparing to come to London, from which place unavoidable buſineſs had detained me much longer than my impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence could well brook; when one morning I met young Moſſop, who at that time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to a ſhip lying at Plymouth. After the uſual ſalutations, he aſked me if I had that morning any letters from London. I replied, I had been from home all the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

My heart ſunk, my dear Meriel, at this intelligence; for, as in my letter I had mentioned the time I ſhould leave Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, I did not expect an anſwer, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally thought, it muſt have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing particular had occaſioned your writing.

I was abſolutely frantic: my father endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſooth me. He had always expreſſed a diſlike at my propoſed union with you, tho' for what reaſon I never could learn. He told me I ought to rejoice at having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered your light, changeable diſpoſition, before it was in your power to injure my honour. I liſtned to him with reverence;
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:029439_0313_0FE115D447B4AFD0"/>
I knew he never yet had expreſſed a wiſh, which did not ultimately tend to my good: I endeavour to calm my tranſports, and ſtrove to perſuade myſelf I ſhould ſoon hate you. I wrote you a long letter, wherein I gave vent to the anguiſh of my heart. I then ſealed up all the dear pledges of your affection, and which till that moment had been preſerved as the choiceſt treaſures I poſſeſſed, and went to ſeek Moſſop.</p>
                     <p>"You did not tell me," ſaid I, "your couſin Meriel was married." "Dear Rains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth," ſaid he, "I had not courage to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you of her perfidy, as I knew you lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the unworthy girl."

She always was of a ſickle temper, I could have told you of many inſtances of her levity of heart, which ſhe ſo effectually hides under an affectation of ſentiment and reſerve; but you were ſo bigoted to her, you would not have believed my aſſertions."

                     <p>From that time I carefully avoided, even the ſociety of Moſſop, leaſt I ſhould hear your name, and be tempted to break my reſolves; and in a very ſhort time I yeilded to the entreaties of my friends, and gave my hand to the lovely, amiable woman, whom you have ſeen, and whom I am ſure you love; for her ſoul is congenial with your own. Meriel, I will not pretend to ſay I had forgot you; but the engaging qualities of my wife, the innocent beauties of my children had in a great meaſure, filled that void in my heart, which the loſs of you had occaſioned.

                     <p>CAN you concieve, my dear Celia, the poignancy of my feelings when I had read this horrid detail of the impoſition that had been practiſed, thus to ruin the peace of Kingly and myſelf. Heſter Moſſop was the perſon, my ſuſpicions reſted on, yet why ſhe ſhould endeavour to undermine my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, when it would by no means conduce either to her intereſt or felicity remains ſtill an inexplicable riddle. I cannot tell you how often I read the dear letter which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decieved me, in regard to Kingly's conduct; how often I preſſed it to my heart, and bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in my tears: amiable youth, charming engaging woman, cried I, as I alternately read the letters of Frederic and his Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret; may your happineſs be as complete as you are deſerving: never will Meriel abuſe the confidence you have placed in her. My reſolution in what manner to conduct myſelf was ſoon formed. I determined to anſwer Kingly's letter, and to commit it unſealed to the care of his amiable wife; I laid my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected plan before the friendly Amelia, and finding it met her approbation, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſat down to put it in execution; the following is a copy of my letter to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

                           <p>HAD not the letter I have juſt peruſed been written in your hand, and delivered to me by Mrs. Kingly, I ſhould be tempted to think ſome whining ſchool boy had tried the extent of his genius in its compoſition. In the name of common ſenſe, my good friend, to what do theſe piteous complaints tend, or from whence do they proceed? are you not the huſband of a woman, every way calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to make the connubial ſtate a ſtate of bliſs? have you not two lovely children, the pledges of her tendereſt affections; and has not Providence bountifully ſhowered its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours on you? have you not health, eaſe and plenty? and yet ſimple mortal, that you are, do you complain and ſigh, becauſe you were not permitted to unite your fate with one, who, if you knew her half ſo well as I do, you would find entirely deſtitute of many of thoſe amiable qualities which ſo eminently diſtinguiſh Mrs. Kingly. For ſhame Kingly, for ſhame, you almoſt tempt me to laugh; your preſent conduct is like that of a ſpoilt child, who having in his poſſeſſion every valuable elegant toy his indulgent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents can procure him, by chance diſcovers

an inſignificant trifle, which at ſome paſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod had amuſed his fancy; but being now out of his reach, he raves, blubbers and roars, throws from him with wild impetuoſity, thoſe already in his poſſeſſion, and with the right, wayward ſpirit of contradiction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to be pacified. You are miſtaken in ſuppoſing young Moſſop decieved you in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to my character; nature formed me thoughtleſs, volatile and capricious: It is true, while you remained with me, I reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my natural levity; but no ſooner were you abſent than I relapſed into my former folly, and innumerable are the giddy incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent actions I have committed; among which, no doubt you will reckon my writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an unaccountable letter, merely to try the ſtrength of your paſſion; to be ſure, I did not think you would have reſented it ſo highly; but when I found that my folly was the means of promoting your intereſt, I heartily rejoiced in your felicity, nor once wiſhed to recall the tranſaction.</p>
                           <p>You are in another error in ſuppoſing me unhappy. I am one of thoſe thoughtleſs, inconſiderate beings, who ſeldom lay any thing long to heart. My fortune is gone, it is true; but, it was diſpoſed of in ſuch a way, as I can never repent. My health and ſpirits are ſtill unimpaired; then conſider,

But there was no other way to reſtore his peace, there was no other way to preſerve the happineſs of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who not only loved him with the moſt enthuſiaſtic paſſion, but had placed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded confidence in me, and ſhewn a friendſhip for me, which I ſhould have ceaſed to deſerve, could I once have been ſo mean as to envy her the poſſeſſion of the man, who conſtituted the whole of her earthly felicity.</p>
                     <p>But tho' I wiſhed Kingly to remain in his error, I could not bear to be thought mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of by this dear woman; I therefore took an opportunity, when I thought it moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he would not be at home, and waited on Mrs. Kingly.

ſhe would kindly believe I was not indeed the very inconſiſtent character I had repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented myſelf, I then preſented to her a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, briefly containing every circumſtance which had paſſed between Kingly and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and encloſing the letter I had received, as I imagined, from his father. She read them with attention, and then declared it was not old Mr. Rainsforth's writing; ſaid ſhe knew his hand perfectly well, and alſo, that he was a man incapable of writing ſo inhuman a letter. "That there has been a ſtrange deception practiſed, is very evident, my dear madam," ſaid I, "but I make no doubt you will join me in thinking, it will be much better to conceal it from Mr. Kingly, as he would undoubtedly think as an officer and as a man of honour, he was under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of reſenting the ungenerous conduct of Mr. Moſſop." "Dear, conſiderate girl," ſaid ſhe, taking my hand, "how do you contrive to riſe every moment higher in my eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem.

"But I muſt inſiſt, my dear madam," ſaid I, "on your keeping my ſecret. Remember it was on the promiſe of inviolable ſilence alone that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted you."

"Ah! deceiver," ſaid ſhe, ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "you cannot perſuade me, that the heart once tenderly attached to ſuch a man as Kingly, can ſo eaſily regain its tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

Clement," continued ſhe, "is not a bad hearted lad, but he is thoughtleſs and extravagant; and what offends Mr. Kingly ſo highly is, he has an intrigue with a woman ſuppoſed to be married. Her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence over him is aſtoniſhing, and her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance knows no bounds; the connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I believe, has been of long duration; but he has not publicly avowed it till within theſe two months. Buſineſs for his mother took him to the continent, and when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſhe accompanied him." "It is a great pity," ſaid I. But at that moment hearing Kingly's voice in the hall, I aroſe to take my leave; and as he entered the room I left it.</p>
                     <p>To-morrow, my dear Celia, I take leave of the amiable, friendly Amelia, and her worthy mother, and enter into Mrs. Rookſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by's family. I am happy to find her ſon is not much at home, as I have met with ſo many vexations from the unmeaning aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities of the men, that I wiſh to avoid as much
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:029439_0325_0FE1161839DF5E60"/>
as poſſible all intercourſe with the ſex: for except Kingly, I can hardly believe there is a good one in the world. There was another, Celia, but he is now no more. Dear ſhade of the benevolent, diſintereſted Welldon, if from thy bliſsful abode thou couldſt, now look down, and behold the heart thy virtue ſnatched from ruin, thou wouldſt ſee it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing with ſuch grateful remembrance, ſuch veneration and affection, as nothing but the hand of death can extinguiſh. Adieu! my dear Celia, I will write again when I can tell you how I like my ſituation.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE now been in this family nearly a month, and feel myſelf as happy as you can imagine, by contraſting my preſent with my late friendleſs and deſolate condition. Mrs. Rookſby has ſeen a good deal of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſince I have been with her, and goes frequently into public. I find, my dear Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, that ſenſibility is not always an object of ridicule; for Mrs. Rookſby and Mrs. Kingly can ſhed tears at a tragedy without endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to conceal, or bluſh for their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I have received ſeveral very genteel preſents from the laſt mentioned lady, and whenever her aunt ſpends a day with her in Golden-Square, I take that opportunity to viſit Miſs Sidney, and ſo avoid a meeting which I am ſenſible cannot be very deſirable to any of the parties.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="152" facs="unknown:029439_0327_0FE11621C9288F08"/>
I have not as yet ſeen Mr. Rookſby, but this evening his mother has a rout previous to her leaving town, and ſhe informs me he will certainly be their. The good old lady pathetically laments her ſons unfortunate attachment, ſays, ſhe is certain, from good information, that he is the dupe of an artful deſigning woman. "She has caught him in her deep laid ſnare," ſaid ſhe, "and he holds himſelf bound to her by gratitude and honour; for I am convinced real affection had little or no ſhare in firſt forming the connection. He firſt became acquainted with her at Oxford, where ſhe paſſed for the wife of an old counſellor. Her form, I am told, is very lovely, and it could not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that a lad of nineteen, ſhould repulſe, or fly the advances of a beautiful accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed woman. When he came to town ſhe left her huſband and two lovely children, and followed him, when a lodging was taking for her a few miles from London. When he went to the continent ſhe met him at Dover, and inſiſted on going with him, and during their journey, the infatuated boy conſented to her returning and living pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly with him in a houſe he has taken for the purpoſe."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="153" facs="unknown:029439_0328_0FE116282DA2F7D8"/>
"He has been acquainted with her ſome years, then," ſaid I. "It is above three years," ſhe replied, "ſince he firſt ſaw her."</p>
                     <p>It is really a ſad thing, my dear Celia, that an abandoned woman ſhould prey upon the fortune and deſtroy the peace of this young man: yet if the tears and intreaties of a fond mother cannot break the fatal charm that holds him, ſure every other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort will be ineffectual. But now my friend, I muſt throw aſide my pen, and be fine lady enough to declare it is for the purpoſe of dreſſing, I begin to wiſh we were in the country, I am already ſick of parade, ſhew and farce; for really a faſhionable life is nothing better. How tireſome to be plagued with the civil howdye's of fifty women, who are immenſely happy to hear you are well, and would ſay, with the ſame <hi>ſang-froid,</hi> they were immenſely ſorry if they were told you were dead. Oh what a miſerable figure I ſhould make in the <hi>beau monde.</hi>

                     <p>Really this Mr. Rookſby is a very tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble being, and if I did not begin to fear he may be the cauſe of future vexation to me I ſhould like to paſs an hour or two in his company, now and then well enough. This morning at breakfaſt Mrs. Rookſby ſaid
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:029439_0329_0FE1162DA3CC94D0"/>
"how happy my dear Miſs Howard, ſhould I be, if your charms and engaging qualities were to draw Clement from his unhappy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement; I have indulged the moſt pleaſing hopes from ſome expreſſions of admiration and ſurpriſe, which broke from him on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing introduced to you laſt night." "They were merely words of courſe, madam," ſaid I, ſmiling, "when he knew I was honoured with your approbation, he could not be ſo wanting in politeneſs as to expreſs any diſlike." "But what will you ſay my dear," ſhe replied, "when I tell you he has abſolutely engaged himſelf to dine with me to day, a favour he has not vouchſafed above twice ſince I came to town." "We will hope, madam, he is returning to a proper ſenſe of his duty."</p>
                     <p>"Ah! Meriel, I wiſh he may entertain a proper ſenſe of your merit; how happy ſhould I be in ſuch a daughter; how certain would he be of happineſs, if bleſſed with ſuch a wife." "Dear madam, you over power me; you over rate my merits, and indeed I feel it is impoſſible I ſhould ever love any man ſufficient to become his wife." "Come," ſaid ſhe, "be candid, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forget Kingly." "Indeed, madam, if I know my own heart, it never yet harboured an improper wiſh; I eſteem both Mr. and
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:029439_0330_0FE11632659AE848"/>
Mrs. Kingly, but I ſhould be extremely ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſee any miſfortune diſſolve their union, but let us drop the ſubject, I wiſh to remain ſingle; let me only enjoy your friendſhip my dear madam, and I ſhall be the happieſt creature on earth."</p>
                     <p>At dinner time Mr. Rookſby arrived. I endeavoured to be unembarraſſed in my manner, but after what had paſſed in the morning it was impoſſible. He was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively polite; but I ſaw his dear mother watch every look, and ſmile approbation, whenever any thing eſcaped him that could be conſtrued into tenderneſs. She preſſed me to play and ſing: ſome little drawings too, which ſhe has honoured by hanging in the drawing-room, were ſubmitted to his inſpection. "They are vaſtly well execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed," ſaid he. "Clara draws very prettily." "I hope," ſaid his mother, "you do not make compariſons." "Aſſuredly I do," he replied haſtily, "but every compariſon muſt only convince me of Miſs Howard's evident ſuperiority, not only in every virtue, but in every accompliſhment." I hope, my dear Celia, this young man will not take it into his head to fancy himſelf in love with me. I never can like him; beſides, I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined never to marry. Adieu, my dear
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:029439_0331_0FE116370A07D348"/>
friend, I wiſh I was in the convent with you; but it was not my fate to paſs a ſerene, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruffled life, and I muſt be as patient as I can till my hour of reſt arrives. Ever your's,</p>

                     <p>THIS is a charming romantic place, my dear Celia. There is room for ſolitude and deep reflection. Oak-hall is ſituated in a very retired part of the country, and has been the family manſion of the Rookſby's from time immemorial. The houſe is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, and inſpires one's mind with the true ſpirit of the days of chivalry. You cannot think, how often I amuſe myſelf with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:029439_0334_0FE11641F73E9018"/>
its antique battlements, the maſſy gates, and deep moat, that ſurround it; and while I gaze with a kind of reverential awe, I fancy, I am perhaps retracing the ſteps of many a gallant knight and beauteous dame who formerly have been inhabitants of this ancient dwelling. I am a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of every thing, that wears the face of antiquity not that I would, were I poſſeſſed of ever ſo large a fortune, lay out my money in purchaſing a heap of trumpery, that are really of no intrinſic value, only as the fancy of the virtuoſo ſtamps them with the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of excellence, becauſe they were made ſome hundred years before we were born. I cannot deny, that I like to examine any little piece of antiquity, which tends to ſhew us the progreſs of the arts or manufactures, and when I enjoy the benefit of any thing uſeful or convenient I feel a kind of vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the genius, who firſt invented it, let it be ever ſo mean or trifling.</p>

                     <p>Mr. Rookſby arrived yeſterday and has this morning, not to my ſurprize, but to my infinite regret, made me an offer of his hand and fortune. It is not, my dear Celia, that I am ſtoic enough to pretend, I have an averſion to being raiſed from a ſtate of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:029439_0335_0FE1164723B0B800"/>
to be miſtreſs of ſeven thouſand pounds a year: but I feel, I ſhall never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard Mr. Rookſby with the affection, which, in my opinion, is abſolutely neceſſary, to make the married ſtate comfortable, though Mrs. Rookſby tells me, that in this I am miſtaken, as ſhe was perfectly happy while her huſband lived; and yet ſhe declares ſhe acceded to the union merely in compliance with the deſires of her parents. It may be ſo, Celia, but I am certain I ſhould never be happy with a man, whom I regard with indifference. But I will give you an account of a converſation, I had this morning with this invader of my peace (I muſt call him ſo, for had it not been for him I ſhould have felt myſelf quite happy in my preſent ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.) We had juſt finiſhed breakfaſt, when a ſervant informed Mrs. Rookſby a poor woman deſired to ſpeak with her. The good old lady is benevolent and humane to all her poor neighbours, and the honeſt induſtrious when oppreſſed by miſfortune are always ſure of meeting a friend in her.</p>
                     <p>I had not been alone with Mr. Rookſby before, ſince my reſidence in the family and to tell you the truth, I would gladly have walked ten miles to have avoided it now. But there was no flying; politeneſs obliged me to ſit ſtill; beſides I thought it would

                        </gap> of the man, ſo childiſh to run away as ſoon as his mother left the room—that I ſat very compoſedly and took up my work, which opportunely was in the room.—We were ſilent near ten minutes, when at length he ſpoke.</p>
                     <p>"May I venture to enquire how Miſs Howard likes the ſituation of my mother's houſe?"</p>
                     <p>"I think it extremely pleaſant, ſir. It ſuits the turn of my mind; I am fond of ſolitude and ſhould be quite happy were I certain of never wandering from this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſpot, to the gay regions of faſhion, folly, and what is in general termed pleaſure."</p>
                     <p>"How blind are you to your own merits, my dear Miſs, if you wiſh thus to hide in obſcurity, beauty and virtue, that would do honour to a court."</p>
                     <p>"You make me ſmile, Mr. Rookſby, how would your gay companions ridicule you could they hear you thus laviſhly compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting an humble dependant of your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's."</p>
                     <p>"And let them laugh, my dear Miſs. Howard, for did they know as I do the true
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029439_0337_0FE116512BC86F60"/>
value of your worth, they would like me, adore it."</p>
                     <p>"This, my dear Celia, was not to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: ſo I was obliged to be content with remaining ſilent and looking like an idiot." While he continued, "I am fully ſenſible of my own unworthineſs of preſuming to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a candidate for Miſs Howard's favour. I know how full of error my ſhort career of life has been; but I truſt your benevolent ſpirit will pardon my paſt follies; and could I preſume to hope you would condeſcend to accept my hand and fortune, I am certain by a conſtant contemplation of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it would ſtrive to immitate, my heart would ſoon be an offering worthy of your acceptance."</p>
                     <p>Dear Celia, how extremely embarraſſing was my ſituation? I felt my face glow. I dared not look up: at length I ſummoned ſufficient courage to ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>"I hardly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſir, in what manner to reply. If the offer you have juſt made be ſeriouſly meant."</p>
                     <p>"If it be ſerious, Miſs Howard, can you ſuppoſe I would trifle on ſo important a ſubject, with any woman, much more with
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:029439_0338_0FE116561EAD8BD0"/>
one ſo truly amiable as yourſelf. Believe me, my charming girl, there is no event could render me ſo happy, or convey ſuch unmixed felicity to the boſom of my mother, as to ſee you become a part of a family which may derive honour from, but can confer none by the alliance."</p>
                     <p>"Your polite and generous propoſal, ſir, demands a candid anſwer. I feel myſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely obliged by the regard with which you are pleaſed to honour me; at the ſame time I am under the neceſſity of declining your offer. I hope you will believe I am not ungrateful for the eſteem and friendſhip I have fortunately met with in your mother's family, and permit me to add, I ſhall always regard her as an affectionate parent and you as a brother: but as to any nearer tie, it never can take place between us."</p>
                     <p>"Never, Miſs Howard. Do not ſay ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver—Time and conſtant aſſiduity will I hope influence your heart in my favour: for without that ſweet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"Indeed, Mr. Rookſby I cannot flatter you. It is at preſent my fixed determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, never to alter my condition: but were that not the caſe"—</p>

                        <pb n="9" facs="unknown:029439_0339_0FE1165C0AE696A0"/>
"Your choice would not fall on me. I am ſatiſfied—Some more happy man."</p>
                     <p>"Pardon me, you are in an error. I am indifferent to all the ſex."</p>
                     <p>"Then why not allow me to ſtrive to awaken the ſenſibility of your heart. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me your happineſs ſhould be the whole ſtudy of my life."</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Rookſby, I will be explicit. Were I ever ſo partial to your virtues, I could not overlook one glaring error in your conduct, an error which not only tarniſhes your own reputation, but preys upon your mother's peace of mind."</p>
                     <p>"You mean my connection with Clara."</p>
                     <p>"I do."</p>
                     <p>"Will you permit me, Miſs Howard, to enter into a little detail of my conduct through the whole of this unhappy connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Unhappy! I muſt always call it, not only from the reaſons you have juſt alledged, but becauſe I foreſee my want of fortitude has involved an amiable woman in infamy and ruin; for had I repulſed the firſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the unhappy Clara's paſſion, affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:029439_0340_0FE116615F2FDF18"/>
pride would have aſſiſted in combating her attachment, and ſhe might at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have been happy in the eſteem and love of her huſband and family. I have often wiſhed to explain this affair to my mother and engage her friendſhip in behalf of Clara, but whenever I attempt to ſpeak, ſhe brands the poor girl with the epithets of artful, vile, enticing ſiren. Alas, Miſs Howard, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Clara's greateſt error is, a too tender attachment to me."</p>
                     <p>Ah man! man! ſaid I mentally, how eaſily does thy vanity, dupe thy reaſon,—Mr. Rookſby continued—</p>
                     <p>"It may appear old, that I ſhould wiſh to enter upon this ſubject to you, but I am certain you will judge with candour and repreſent Clara to my mother in ſuch a light as may lead her to befriend a woman, who has ſacrificed fame, happineſs, and honour to me. You will aſk, perhaps, why I do not marry her, as her huſband is lately dead, I would anſwer, that ſhe is not a woman calculated to make me happy. Her temper is impetuous, and though her form is lovely and ſhe has received a poliſhed education, ſhe poſſeſſes not that true feminine ſoftneſs and delicacy which in my opinion alone can render a woman really amiable.

with her commenced about four years ſince, while I was completing my ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies at Oxford. At that time her huſband Mr. Millar was a counſellor reſiding at that city. He invited me frequently to his houſe. I ſaw Mrs. Millar, and admired her as a lovely accompliſhed woman; nay more, I pitied her, for I ſaw ſhe was not happy. Her ſiſter, Miſs Ramſay, who reſided in the houſe wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> navy: but age and infirmities obliging him to retire upon his half pay, they found their circumſtances greatly ſtraitened. At this time, Mr. Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar paid their father a viſit. He was ſtruck with the beauty and innocence of Clara, and though at that time near fifty years old, he had the vanity to think he could render himſelf agreeable to a girl of ſeventeen."</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps," ſaid I, "it was a benevolent wiſh to lighten the expences of his friend and place the young lady in a ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence which urged him to make the offer of his hand."</p>
                     <p>It might be ſo, ſhe replied, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his motives might be, gratitude and filial love incited Clara to accept the offer, and ſacrifice herſelf to the man ſhe diſliked; to ſecure eaſe and affluence to her father
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029439_0342_0FE1166C7A2D6EC0"/>
and ſiſter: but he lived not long to enjoy the fruits of her kindneſs. A ſlow decline carried him off about a year after his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's marriage. At this time I was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into Mr. Millar's family. Clara was juſt become a mother; her huſband ſeemed to idolize her; ſhe could not breathe a wiſh which was not inſtantly gratified. Yet ſhe was far from happy, and I often ſaw her turn aſide to conceal tears, which ſeemed to flow from an oppreſſed heart. One afternoon, Mr. Millar was from home, her ſiſter ſitting at the other end of the room reading. Clara roſe from her ſeat on pretence of reaching ſomething from the chimney piece, and ſtooping, picked up a paper which ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to me, ſaying, you drop your letters about very careleſsly. I took the paper and perceived it was a ſealed letter. I will not ſhock your delicacy, Miſs Howard, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the contents of this letter. I can perceive by your countenance, that you think it a ſufficient error for a married wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to entertain an inclination for any other man than her huſband without daring to avow her paſſion. I am ſenſible, Clara acted with imprudence; but who can anſwer for the emotions of a heart, under the influence of its firſt tender attachment? And however culpable, ſhe might be, I think myſelf more ſo. I ſhould have never more entered Mr.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:029439_0343_0FE116722B6AB348"/>
Millar's houſe, when I found how detrimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal my preſence was, both to his honour and happineſs. I ſhould have avoided the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the fair ſeducer, and confined my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more than ever to my ſtudies. I am conſcious this ſhould have been my conduct; but, alas! it was quite the reverſe. I ſought every opportunity of being in her company. I encouraged her growing tenderneſs. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate enterviews enſued, and honour, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and friendſhip were all forgotten. Though our entercourſe continued, during the whole time I remained at Oxford, Mr. Millar never ſuſpected his injuries. The ſiſter was in our confidence, and ſhe always contrived our meetings in ſuch a manner, that they appeared the effect of chance. Juſt before I left Oxford, Clara was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined with her ſecond child. This prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my taking a perſonal leave. I wrote, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming her of the neceſſity of my removal, aſſured her of my grateful affection and that I would take frequent opportunities of viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her in future. This I ſaid, merely to quiet her anxiety; for reaſon had began to operate; the miſt of paſſion was diſſipated and I was determined to put an end to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, at once ſo diſhonourable and unjuſt. I choſe to take the opportunity of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement for my departure, as I knew how ill I could ſupport taking a perſonal leave,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:029439_0344_0FE1167646A35F10"/>
where tears, faintings, and hyſterics would effectually unbend my beſt reſolutions. I therefore entruſted my letter to the ſiſter, without informing her of the contents, and ſet forward immediately for London. I had not been in town above a fortnight, when one morning, as I ſat at breakfaſt, I heard a chaiſe ſtop at the door, and in a moment Clara ruſhed into the parlour where I was ſitting.</p>
                     <p>Good God," ſaid I, "Mrs. Millar what has brought you to town."—"What," ſhe replied, "what but your cruel deſertion of me. Unkind, ungenerous Rookſby, did you think I would live ſeparated from you."—"My dear Clara,," ſaid I, "conſider how your reputation will ſuffer when this raſh ſtep is known"—" What is reputation to me," cried she, "if I am deprived of your love I loſe all that can make life valuable."—"Where are your children, Clara,"—"I left them too, for your ſake, Rookſby; and is this cold, unkind reception all the return I am likely to meet."—"You call me cold, and unkind; but believe me, you wrong me, I feel all, nay much more than I ought for you, but I am very ſorry to find you have ſo little regard for yourſelf as thus to incur the cenſure of the world by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man who has it not in his power to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:029439_0345_0FE1167C32114E78"/>
offer you an honorable protection."—" You throw me from you, then. You will not receive me" (cried ſhe, ſtarting up, and wildly claſping her hands,) Oh Rookſby this is more than I can bear—I am burſting—My heart is ſwollen ſo large; it choaks me.—" Be calm, I beſeech you, my dear Clara, I do not refuſe to receive you; no, my poor girl, I feel myſelf bound to protect you; for I know it was I firſt drew you from your duty; but I am ſenſible, how little recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence it is in my power to make for the many comforts and bleſſings I have robbed you of." "Oh Rookſby," ſaid ſhe, "let me enjoy your ſociety, and be bleſſed with your love, and I ſhall not regret any ſacrifice I have made."</p>
                     <p>What could I do, Miſs Howard, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Mr. Rookſby.—There was but one way. I offered to take her a houſe a little way out of town and viſit her occaſionally. She acceded to the propoſal and changed her name. Soon after her ſiſter came to town, and with her brought the two children, whom ſhe ſaid Mr. Millar had in his reſentment turned out of doors.—I now conſidered my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as bound to provide for theſe unfortunate children; but I had no idea of making my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a reſident in the ſame houſe with their mother. But when I went over to France
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:029439_0346_0FE116815E4B7288"/>
this laſt autumn, ſhe followed me, and with ſuch earneſtneſs declared ſhe would ſooner die than be ſeparated from me for one week, that I was unable to refuſe the requeſt ſhe made to accompany me abroad. While we were on the continent we heard from her ſiſter, that Mr. Millar was dead.—From that time, Clara earneſtly preſſed me to marry her; but I told her not to form any ſuch vain expectation, as that was an event, which never could take place; however I promiſed always to be her friend, and in conſideration of her then evident pregnancy, conſented that on our return to England, I would take a houſe in London and reſide with her.—Alas! my dear young lady, I knew not what inconveniencies I was bringing upon myſelf:—Her expences far outran the annual ſum I had allotted her; ſhe is never happy but when I am with her, and even when I devote almoſt my whole time to her, ſhe is peeviſh, diſſatisfied and conſtantly complaining of my altered carriage towards her. Alas, I know I am changed; but I am alſo certain I never failed in tender ſolicitude, and attention to her welfare. I never did love her. Vanity, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and the wild impulſes of youth have been miſtaken for that paſſion. I am now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of my error. My heart now vibrates with a true and ardent affection. I will never ſuffer Clara to know want; but the future
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029439_0347_0FE11686B43E5FD8"/>
happineſs or miſery of my life muſt depend entirely upon Miſs Howard.</p>
                     <p>I had liſtened attentively, during this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital. I found much to blame in Clara. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they had both been guilty of errors of ſuch magnitude, that in my opinion they deſerved the appellation of crimes: but it was not for me to condemn. I knew from fatal experience, how imprudent were the dictates of a youthful heart. And though I felt a ſecret horror at the recital of Rookſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by's cruel perfidy, to his kind, unſuſpecting friend Mr. Millar, yet he appeared innocent in compariſon with Clara. Her huſband loved her almoſt to adoration; he had raiſed her from poverty to affluence; he had chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the laſt hours of her father, and offered an aſſylum to her orphan ſiſter. He was the father of her children, Celia. Yet could ſhe ungratefully betray the honour he had confided to her care; forſake this kind, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent huſband, deſert her innocent chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in that helpleſs ſtate, when they require all a mother's fond ſolicitude and anxious maternal care.—And for this inhuman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſhe pleads love. Celia! real love ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet incited its votaries to baſe or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable actions. I am certain, I never could like Clara. She appears to me an artful deſigning woman, and from Rookſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by's
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:029439_0348_0FE1168C0C2413F8"/>
account, I think, intereſt has been the main ſpring of her actions. Indeed, that alone urged her to follow him; for had ſhe regarded him with real affection, ſhe would have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> from the idea of becoming a burthen to him: and do not, my dear Celia, think I am turning rigidly cenſorious, if I ſay, I ſuſpect ſhe was not really the wife of Mr. Millar; though that takes but little from her guilt, as ſhe certainly had received many tokens of affection from him, and had been received and reſpected as his wife by all the families who lived in their neighbourhood. All theſe reflections had paſſed rapidly thro' my mind, while Mr. Rookſby was ſpeaking. When he pauſed, I found myſelf neceſſitated to anſwer.</p>
                     <p>"You ſay, ſir, your heart is very deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: it has once betrayed you into actions and connections you now heartily repent. May it not do ſo again. Truſt not to its impulſe: call in the aid of reaſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, and you will find your preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination will prove as great a deluſion as the former."</p>
                     <p>"Impoſſible!" he replied, vehemently, "impoſſible, I can never alter my opinion in regard to Miſs Howard."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="19" facs="unknown:029439_0349_0FE11691729F2EC8"/>
"And believe me, ſir," ſaid I, gravely, "it is equally impoſſible I can ever alter mine in regard to you."</p>
                     <p>I then attempted to leave the room; but he caught my hand. "Stay, my dear girl, only one moment; let me intreat you, only to recall that cruel word never. Give me but the moſt diſtant ray of hope and I will endeavor to be ſatiſfied."—" Well, Sir," ſaid I ſmiling, "if you remain of the ſame opinion you are now, forty years hence, I will talk with you further on the ſubject." He releaſed my hand and turned from me in ſullen ſilence. I embraced the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and immediately quitted the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But here was a freſh ſcene of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution to encounter. Mrs. Rookſby met me, as I went acroſs the hall, and taking hold of my arm, we walked into the garden. "I ſee, my dear Meriel," ſaid ſhe, "you are not pleaſed; poor Clement has little to hope: but come tell me, have you given him a poſitive refuſal?"—My dear Madam, you already know my ſentiments on that ſubject, I have no inclination for matrimony, I wiſh to remain ſingle; for I am certain I ſhould never have patience ſufficient to ſubmit to all the whims and caprices of thoſe lords of the creation. "I am afraid Meriel, you deceive yourſelf, and that under the idea of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:029439_0350_0FE116970608F3D0"/>
a diſinclination for marriage, you nouriſh a hopeleſs and deſtructive paſſion. I know my dear girl how nobly you have conducted yourſelf in regard to Mr. Kingly. My niece has informed me of the whole: but my good girl, while you are thus ſtudiouſly promoting the happineſs of others, why neglect your own, why ſacrifice the bloom and ſpring of life to a paſſion, which however well placed, is now no longer innocent."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! Madam," I replied, "do not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect me of cheriſhing ſo improper a deſire; can I not be ſuffered to paſs quietly through the remainder of my life, without forming any other connection than friendſhip? Why muſt I be obliged to undertake duties I am ſo very unable to perform? Or why do you wiſh a heart long ſince dead to pleaſure, from whom every tender tie is now ſevered, to have its ſenſibility again awakened, to have new affections; to make it again fond of life, only perhaps to experience again the acute pangs of loſing the beloved objects that had called thoſe affections forth?"—" My dear Meriel, you muſt not argue thus; we are all born to encounter trouble."—" Alas! Madam, my ſhare has already been almoſt beyond my weak power to ſupport; for from the day in which I left the Convent till the preſent, I have not experienced one ſo
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:029439_0351_0FE1169C6B5AFBD8"/>
happy that I could wiſh it to return, yet heaven knows I do not complain; but I wiſh not to engage in new ſcenes."</p>
                     <p>"You muſt conſider, Miſs Howard, it is not for us to mark out the path we wiſh to tread, and cry I will not deviate from it. We are not ſent into the world to paſs thro' it in indolence. Remember my love that life which is not in ſome meaſure ſerviceable to our fellow-creatures, is not acceptable to our Creator. You in particular are ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, endowed with abilities to ſhine in the reſpective characters of Wife, Mother, and the miſtreſs of a family, and will you be the unprofitable ſervant and hide thoſe talents intruſted to your care, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of your friends and the benefit of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general"—</p>
                     <p>"But Clara, madam, I hope you will allow that is an obſtacle?"—" It is only ſo in your opinion: To me it is the great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of my earneſt wiſh to ſee Clement unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you—Clara ſhall be amply provided for"—</p>
                     <p>"And her child?"—" We will take it home, ſhould it be born alive, and I will ſee it ſhall be properly educated and a handſome proviſion made for its future ſupport. Now
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:029439_0352_0FE116A09D791EC8"/>
my dear Meriel, I think all your objections are removed." "You muſt, dear madam, give me time for conſideration, before I can determine on ſo important a ſubject."</p>
                     <p>"You ſhall not be hurried, my love, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let me have your leave to bid Clement hope."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! do not I beſeech you, raiſe falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hopes. It may not be in my power to realize them."—" Well then," ſaid ſhe, "I will remain ſilent, till I have your leave to ſpeak." She then turned into another walk and I returned to the houſe.—" And, now my dear Celia, how would you adviſe me to act. I fear, turn which way I will, I am ſtill in an error. Ah! my ſweet friend, I cannot teach this ſtubborn heart indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence toward Kingly, and ſure I am, whilſt I remain ſingle, my partiality will be ever the ſame. Should I marry, other ties and the important duties of my ſtation will call my mind from this dangerous object: But then to give my hand and vow obedience to a man, whom my heart refuſes to love, is certainly an error; and what is worſe, the irrevocable words, once paſt, there will be no flying from my fate, however repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant it may be to my feelings. I will write to my dear Amelia on the ſubject; alio to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:029439_0353_0FE116A6B2DA0D18"/>
to Mrs. Kingly. Their opinions ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide my fate. Yet, my dear Celia, believe me, my ſoul ſhrinks from an union with Rookſby. I know not why, but whenever I think of it, a cold chill runs through my veins, and my heart ſinks within me: but I am grown ſtrangely fanciful of late. I am greatly altered ſince we-parted. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, I am but the ſhadow of my former ſelf, the ſerenity of temper I once boaſted to enjoy is entirely loſt, and I am like a frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard child. Adieu, I am changed in every thing but friendſhip to you.</p>

in the pit. In the pit you ſay, bleſs me Amelia, I ſhould bluſh to death to be thought to know any one in the pit. Pardon me, dear Meriel, I know your good little heart ſo well, I am certain the friend you eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would always be recognized while ſhe continued deſerving of your notice, though poverty and diſtreſs were ſtrongly marked by her appearance. And now to be ſerious concerning your letter, Mr. Rookſby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me a weak young man; but there ſeems great goodneſs of heart in him and I think it would be a charitable action to ſnatch him from ruin.—for inevetable ruin muſt follow his connection with Clara. I am informed her ſtile of living is the moſt extravagant immaginable, and ſuch ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did preparations are making for her <hi>accouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that you would think her a dutcheſs of the firſt rank. And now I am ſpeaking of charitable actions, let me repreſent to my friend the many aching hearts it will be in her power to relieve when ſhe is miſtreſs of ſuch an ample fortune, as Mr. Rookſby of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to her acceptance. And again, my love, conſider what a relief it will be to the generous Mrs. Kingly to ſee you ſo well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled. Even Kingly himſelf will be happier when you are married, for truſt me while you remain ſingle he will nouriſh the idea that your partiality for him is the occaſion
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:029439_0359_0FE116C1A56CCF80"/>
of your preferring a ſtate of celibacy.—That you will be happier in yourſelf, I am well convinced. New ſcenes will open to your imagination, paſt ſorrows will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and the afflictions of the daughter ſhall be amply repaid by the felicity of the mother. Ah! my dear Meriel, you muſt marry, if it be only to experience the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative happineſs of having a daughter, whoſe ſoul ſhall be the exact model of your own. Methinks too, my friend, you will feel your boſom dilate with pleaſure, when you can call Mrs. Rookſby by the endearing name of mother. A heart like yours, ſo formed for all the endearing ties of life when deprived of its natural relation, ſeeks ſome one on whom to reſt its affection. Accept then my dear girl, the offered good that awaits you, let your heart expand to receive all thoſe delightful ſenſations which reſult from a felicitous matrimonial union, and while you are alternately addreſſed by the endearing titles of mother and daughter; while the man whom you ſhall bleſs with your hand, reveres, admires, adores you, the diſappointments of your youth ſhall be no more remembered, except it is with a kind of ſmiling wonder at their ever having made you uneaſy. My mother bids me tell you ſhe wiſhes you may be as truly happy

                     <p>WHEN I had read theſe letters, my mind ſtill wavering and irreſolute, I repaired to Mrs. Rookſby's dreſſing room. I found her weeping. "Meriel," ſaid ſhe, as I entered, "you are come in good time to comfort me. Clement has juſt been with me. He leaves us to-morrow."</p>
                     <p>"To-morrow, Madam, that is much ſooner than he at firſt intended."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Meriel, and he leaves us with an intention that almoſt deprives me of reaſon."</p>

"You ſurprize me, what intention can he have formed, that gives you ſo much anxiety."</p>
                     <p>"He is determined to marry Clara im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on his arrival in London, that his child may be legetimated."</p>
                     <p>"Marry Clara," ſaid I, with an emotion of aſtoniſhment.</p>
                     <p>"It is even ſo my dear; he juſt now told me he found it was in vain to hope any thing from you, and being deprived of the hope of your affection he knew love could have no part in any other union, he was determined that the claims of honour ſhould be attended to, and his innocent child have not future cauſe to curſe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of its being, ſince that being would, if he did not marry Clara, inherit infamy as its birth-right."</p>
                     <p>"I cannot think," I replied, "that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by any means obliges him to marry that woman. She certainly forfeited all claim to an honourable protector, when ſhe fled from Mr. Millar. I wiſh ſhe was well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, and far from Mr. Rookſby, for I am cartain that inevitable miſery and ruin muſt enſue from a continuation of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

connection with her. What then would bethe conſequence of an indiſſoluble union? I tremble to think of it."</p>
                     <p>"You will ſee him, Miſs Howard, before he leaves Oak-hall. Let me beg of you, my dear girl, to exert all your eloquence, to perſuade him from ſo fatal a ſtep. Give ſome hope, even if it ſhould be but falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and I make no doubt, but we ſhall retain him with us a little time longer, and who knows what time may do."</p>
                     <p>"I cannot deceive any perſon, my dear madam. If I am tempted to hold out hope to draw your ſon from this deſtructive reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be aſſured, I ſhall one day mean to realize them."—" Bleſſings on you my ſweet Meriel, you will then relent; I ſhall have the happineſs of ſeeing my ſon preſerved from ruin, and obtain a daughter who muſt be admired and eſteemed by all, who are ſo happy as to know her."</p>
                     <p>"I did not abſolutely ſay ſo, madam. I will ſee Mr. Rookſby previous to his intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed departure. I will uſe every argument in my power to prevail with him to give up his deſign in regard to Clara; if I find every other argument ineffectual, I will promiſe ſome future day to give him my hand. But
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:029439_0363_0FE116D553E8E0C8"/>
let me requeſt my dear friendly Mrs. Rookſby to attribute this reſolution to its proper cauſe. I will not deceive your ſon with profeſſions of affection which I do not feel. I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived many favours from you and your amiable niece Mrs. Kingly, and I think it will be to your mutual ſatiſfaction, to ſee me married. I am ſenſible, it is a duty alſo which I owe myſelf, as, whilſt I continue ſingle, I ſhall always be ſuſpected of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing an improper affection for Mr. Kingly, and as it is my earneſt wiſh to preſerve my own reputation unſullied and to promote as much as poſſible the happineſs of others, I will unite myſelf to Mr. Rookſby, but alas, I have nothing to offer in return for his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous affection but eſteem and friendſhip."</p>
                     <p>"Enough my love," cried Mrs. Rookſby embracing me, "I have no doubt of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's happineſs, when bleſt with the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem of ſo amiable a companion."</p>
                     <p>At dinner we all met as uſual. Mr. Rookſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by was in his travelling dreſs. "Are you for riding this afternoon, ſir," ſaid I—" I think of ſetting forward for London, Miſs Howard, I have an affair of infinite conſequence to tranſact there, and I fear delays may be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous."—" You muſt not leave us to-night, however, Clement," ſaid his mother ſmiling.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:029439_0364_0FE116D94A7C0178"/>
—" I did not underſtand you intended leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oak-hall till to-morrow," ſaid I.—" I would willingly ſtay here forever," he replied, "but I am ſenſible my preſence is detrimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the tranquility of one whoſe happineſs I would promote at the hazard of my life."—This was a compliment, my dear Celia, which I could not take entirely to myſelf, as he might have meant Clara's happineſs was diſturbed by his remaining at Oak-hall, I therefore remained ſilent, and little more was ſaid, till the cloth was removed. I then aroſe to leave the room with Mrs. Rookſby, who generally retires to her dreſſing room after dinner, and as is often the caſe with elderly people, indulges herſelf with a nap. As I aroſe Mr. Rookſby took my hand. "Permit me, Miſs Howard, before I take my leave to requeſt the honour of a few minutes converſation." I curtefied aſſent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſumed my ſeat; he continued.</p>
                     <p>"It is with infinite regret, my dear young lady, that I leave this place, as by ſo doing I relinquiſh every hope, which I had fondly cheriſhed of obtaining an intereſt in your boſom. I ſee my preſence is painful to you, it encroaches on that tranquillity you would otherwiſe enjoy, in a place ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your diſpoſition. I hope you will believe, your happineſs is an object of far
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:029439_0365_0FE116DF27D2EE58"/>
greater moment to me than my own. I go from hence with a fixed reſolution to repair the injuries I have done Clara; but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you how near your intereſt is and ever will be to my heart, I muſt beg you will conſider yourſelf from this moment indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. In this (preſenting me a ſmall box) you will find a writing, which conveys to you and yours for ever an eſtate worth two hundred pounds a year, ſituated in Glamorganſhire. I will not be either inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted or contradicted (ſeeing I was about to ſpeak.) You muſt accept this as from a brother, who though his own future days will have ſcarce a dawn of pleaſure to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven them, will always have the comfort of reflecting the moſt amiable woman in the world will be no more reduced to ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at once ſo unworthy her merits, and painful to her feelings."</p>
                     <p>Overcome by this generous conduct I was unable to ſpeak. Tears involuntarily burſt from my eyes and ſeeing him about to leave the room, almoſt unknowing what I did, I caught his hand to detain him.—</p>
                     <p>"Do not diſtreſs me, my dear Miſs How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, ſaid he, thoſe tears are too precious to be ſhed on ſuch a trivial occaſion."</p>

                        <pb n="36" facs="unknown:029439_0366_0FE116E300EF0768"/>
"Trivial," ſaid I, "Oh! Mr. Rookſby, I cannot accept this noble donation. It op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes me beyond meaſure. I have no way of diſcharging the vaſt debt of gratitude."</p>
                     <p>"My ſweet girl," ſaid he, kiſſing my hand. "Remember me ever with a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection and I ſhall think myſelf a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times repaid."</p>
                     <p>"I cannot take it, ſir, indeed I cannot. But let me prefer one requeſt to you. Do not leave us this afternoon, remain a few days longer to oblige me."—</p>
                     <p>No, my dear Meriel, I ſee the generous drift of your deſign. You pity me, you wiſh to make me happy and to oblige my mother would ſacrifice your own felicity; but, my dear friend, if I have nothing to hope from affection, I will not be indebted to gratitude or compaſſion.</p>
                     <p>"But, dear Mr. Rookſby, conſider how you will diſtreſs your mother by thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitately giving your hand to Mrs. Millar; You muſt pardon me, ſir, but indeed I do not think her altogether worthy ſuch an honour."</p>
                     <p>"Such a ſevere expreſſion from miſs Howard is ſomething extraordinary; but
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:029439_0367_0FE116E86DF332E8"/>
women (added he ſmiling) are not always the moſt candid judges of each other. You my dear Miſs behold in Clara only a frail woman, who forgetful of the rigid dictates of honour and virtue ſacrificed reputation, friends, every valuable conſideration to an unhappy paſſion. I behold her as a lovely unfortunate creature, who has made thoſe ſacrifices for me. I alſo conſider that, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, had it been her fate to be united to the man of her heart, ſhe would at this moment have been a reſpectable member of ſociety; and if I reflect, that I only am the cauſe, that ſhe is not ſo, can I do otherwiſe than repair as much, as is in my power, the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries her reputation has ſuffered on my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count."</p>
                     <p>"I think, Mr. Rookſby, you argue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly right, nor ſhould I have entered on this ſubject, had it not been at the earneſt requeſt of your mother. She ſhudders at the idea of your introducing into the family a woman of light fame. She has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that Mrs. Millar is a very faulty wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in more reſpects than one. She wiſhes to have her amply provided for, but cannot endure to think ſhe muſt be the wife of her darling ſon."</p>

                        <pb n="38" facs="unknown:029439_0368_0FE116EC172BB3A0"/>
"I ſaw, Miſs Howard, from the firſt that it was at my mother's deſire you ſo chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſented to this converſation. She knew the generoſity of your diſpoſition. She na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſuppoſed you would exert yourſelf to prevail with me to relinquiſh my deſign. She foreſaw the generous conceſſions you would make in my favour: but ſhe knows not the heart of her ſon, if ſhe imagines affection like his could be ſatiſfied with any thing leſs than affection in return."</p>
                     <p>"I am ſorry, I ſhall be able to give no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter account of my undertaking; but, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Mr. Rookſby, permit me to decline, this obligation (returning the writings). I am perfectly ſatiſfied with my ſituation in your mother's family, and muſt inſiſt on your receiving this again."</p>
                     <p>He refuſed to take it. I laid it on the table and haſtily left the room.</p>
                     <p>So you ſee, my dear Celia, while I was conſulting my friends whether I ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or reject this man, he has haſtily form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reſolution of leaving me to wear the willow and beſtowing himſelf on another. Seriouſly my friend I feel myſelf greatly obliged by the delicate manner in which he declined accepting a hand when he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:029439_0369_0FE116F1E2C82CC0"/>
the heart would not immediately follow, and were it not that I fear he will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely unhappy in an union with Clara, I ſhould rejoice in being releaſed from his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities. Mrs. Rookſby is in great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. I try all I can to comfort her; but I really believe ſhe will feel as much, when ſhe ſees her ſon mount his horſe to leave the Hall, as ſhe would were ſhe attending him to the ſilent receptacle of his anceſtors. When this dreaded wedding is over ſhe will, I make no doubt, feel eaſier, and the birth of her grandchild will naturally awaken ſome degree of affection towards its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>You will, perhaps, my dear Celia, blame, me for ſo obſtinately refuſing Mr. Rookſby's generous preſent; but my dear girl I am the worſt in the world to receive an obligation. It oppreſſes me; it ſinks me to the earth, eſpecially when I have no power to return it. While I have my health, I have no doubt of always finding a ſituation, where I may render myſelf in ſome meaſure uſeful, in return for my ſubſiſtence, and ſhould ſickneſs, age or any infirmity, to which mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality is ſubject, overtake me, whilſt I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in what is generally termed an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected ſtate, I have ſtill the ſame beneficent

                     <p>The morning after I concluded my laſt, Mr. Rookſby ſet off for London. His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:029439_0371_0FE116FC16E315C8"/>
would not take leave of him at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and I was obliged to conſent that a correſpondence ſhould be commenced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us; for ſhe had abſolutely declared all intercourſe with her muſt ceaſe, from the moment he married Clara. Accordingly on the fourth day after his departure I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a letter, informing me he had arrived too late for his purpoſe: for Clara had been in bed two days, and little maſter was as fine a boy as ever was ſeen, and in perfect health. Mrs. Rookſby greatly rejoiced, that any thing had happened to poſtpone the wedding, and flattered herſelf the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection would by ſome means or other be broke off. It was near ſix weeks before we had any farther tidings of him, though I had anſwered his letter immediately. It was at the cloſe of evening; Mrs. Rookſby was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined on a ſopha; for the weather was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely hot, and I was playing on the harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſichord which I accompanied with my voice.

When we were interrupted by the ſound of horſes coming up the avenue, and in a few minutes Mr. Rookſby ruſhed into the room, pale and to all appearance worn out with fatigue. He ſpoke not at entering, but throwing himſelf into his mother's arms, burſt into tears.</p>
                     <p>"Clement," ſaid ſhe, "my dear Clement what is the matter. Good God! you weep, your hands are hot. You are very ill."—"Oh! mother," he replied, "forgive me. I know it is unlike a man, but the ſhock I have received."—" Is Clara dead then," ſaid ſhe.—" Clara, did you ſay, Oh the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, name her not, I cannot truſt myſelf to ſpeak of her, ſhe is—but come we will not talk about her."</p>
                     <p>"You come upon us rather unexpected," ſaid I, advancing towards him.</p>
                     <p>"I came," ſaid he, "as faſt as a repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed change of horſes would bring me, for I knew there was no other place, where I could find comfort. You, my dear Miſs Howard will comfort me, and you will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with my mother, to receive under her protecting roof ſome poor little orphans who will arrive to-morrow to claim her care."</p>

"You are ſenſible, Clement, that every child of affliction is welcome to me. I will protect and ſerve them to the utmoſt of my power. How much greater then will be their claim on my humanity, when they come recommended by you."</p>
                     <p>"And when one of them is my child," cried he vehemently,—" my dear mother, that woman, whom I had intended to make my wife—but no matter, ſhe is gone. She has forſaken her poor little innocents; but I will not ſuffer them to know want."</p>
                     <p>"You are not married then?"—"No"—"Thank heaven, my dear Clement, thank heaven, your honour will not ſuffer by this cruel deſertion, and let the vile mother go, we will protect the unoffending children."</p>
                     <p>After ſupper, Mr. Rookſby was more compoſed. He told us, that on his arrival in London he haſtened to Clara and found her as he had informed us, the mother of a fine boy and likely to do well. He told her with what intention he had hurried to town, and ſaid, if ſhe deſired it, a ſpecial licence ſhould be procured and the ceremony per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in her own chamber. This ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately refuſed alledging, that, as her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace had been public, ſhe deſired the repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

might be public alſo. To this he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented and preparations were making for the public performance of the ceremony. He had preſented her with a magnificent ſet of jewels, and with money to the amount of three thouſand pounds. A day was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the union: the articles, ſettlements, &amp;c. were all ready for ſigning: When the evening preceding the appointed morning he called at her houſe and was informed ſhe was gone to a private ball ſome few miles out of town. He thought it ſomewhat ſtrange, but knowing the volatility of her diſpoſition and how extremely fond of every thing that wore the ſemblance of pleaſure, it did not ſo much ſurprize him. The next morning he repaired to her at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, a new equipage, ſervants in new liveries with white and ſilver favours arrived at the door. The gueſts began to appear when enquiries were made for the bride.—Mr. Rookſby went up to haſten her. She was not in her dreſſing-room. He called for her woman: ſhe was not to be found.

                           <p>You thought to have deceived me, but you are miſtaken. I have been informed of all your late diſhonourable conduct. Would your mother's humble companion have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted your hand, it would never have been offered to me: but though you have been a dupe to me I will not become one to you. I know, you will, at the reception of this, rave and curſe your evil genius which has induced you to make yourſelf the laughing ſtock of your acquaintance. I am far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of your revenge, and enjoy in idea, the ridiculous figure you will, at the moment you are reading this appear, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by your friends decked in the trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of nuptial finery and deſerted by the intended bride. I have left the brats.—They would have been troubleſome on the long journey I mean to take; you may either provide for them or ſend them to the work-houſe; either way will be equally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to me. I have accepted the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of a noble lover, and mean to make with him the tour of Europe. You muſt now offer yourſelf again to Miſs Howard, and I wiſh ſhe may ſerve you as I have done.</p>

It is eaſy to conceive the paſſion this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous ſcrawl created in the boſom of Rookſby. He was in the firſt paroxyſins of rage for putting an immediate period to his exiſtence. Shame, vexation, and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment drove him to the verge of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. At length he recollected the child of whom he is extremely fond. He called for it, declared that the mother's guilt ſhould never be revenged on her innocent offſpring, and in careſſing the little cherub, in ſome meaſure compoſed the perturbation of his ſpirits. The company diſperſed, he ſent away his chariot, and returned to his lodging in a hackney-coach, where he undreſſed and ordering poſt horſes, ſet forward immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately for Oak-hall, leaving his own man to follow with the nurſe and children. The eldeſt, who is a girl, I am told is at ſchool in a village near Oxford, where Mr. Rookſky has every reaſon to be ſatisfied with the care taken of her education and morals. He means, he ſays, that ſhe ſhall have a uſeful education, and will ſettle on her a thouſand pounds, the intereſt of which is to be appropriated to her ſupport. The two boys, he will bring up together and by a liberal education fit them for one of the genteel profeſſions, the choice of which ſhall remain with themſelves. To them alſo he will give a thouſand pounds each; but
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:029439_0377_0FE1171873E51478"/>
they are both to be called by the name of Millar. This is certainly a noble ſpirited young man. It is a pity he has not more firmneſs of temper; but he is as weak as an infant and as eaſily perſuaded by perſons who rightly underſtand his diſpoſition. Awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his gratitude or make a claim upon his honour, and you may lead him as you pleaſe. This is far from the kind of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that I like. Were I ever ſo much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to Mr. Rookſby, I ſhould be afraid of profeſſing it, leaſt it ſhould be ſuppoſed I meant to take an undue advantage of his eaſy nature, and I ſhould, if married to ſuch a man, avoid ſhewing a thouſand little kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, leaſt I ſhould ſeem to demand more than ſimilar attentions from him. There is another trait in his character, which I have lately diſcovered. He is vain and rather addicted to jealouſy; and I can perceive there is no part of Clara's conduct hurts him more ſeverely, than finding her ſo totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different—and when he imagined her ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attached to himſelf, to know her capable of eloping with another.</p>
                     <p>And yet, my dear Celia, this very man with all his errors, they have ſome how or other among them drawn me into a ſort of promiſe to marry. Mrs. Kingly wrote and my dear Amelia wrote too.—Mrs.
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:029439_0378_0FE1171D39FEFC20"/>
Rookſby pleaded, and Clement himſelf, looked ſuch eloquent things, that what with the grateful remembrance of his generoſity, toward me, which I forgot to tell you his mother inſiſted on my accepting, and a ſort of pity for his late diſappointment, I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced a kind of ſentiment which I know not how to diſtinguiſh. It is more lively than eſteem, and yet I am ſure it is not love. However, be it what it may, the die is caſt, and I believe Rookſby will be the man with whom I am deſtined to paſs my life. The ſettlements, &amp;c. prepared for Clara, his mother declares ſhall remain for me, as blanks had been left for the names. I do not agree to this point; as I think the ſettlement by far too large. I think it very neceſſary a proper proviſion ſhould be made in caſe of a large family, but as I have no fortune, it would be unjuſt as well as unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to accept a ſettlement of ſeven hundred a year. This I am reſolved to over rule.—Three hundred will be more than ſufficient. On this condition alone, will I give him my hand, for it ſhall never be ſaid the poor Meriel Howard aggrandized herſelf at the expence of the Rookſby family. For here are ill natured people in all families and no doubt many of Mr. Rookſby's relations will think themſelves degraded by this alliance.</p>

In about a month from this time, my dear friend, my fate will be decided. Contrary to my inclination, the old lady will have a public wedding, and all the family to the third and fourth generation are to be invited. The old manſion is put into ſuch a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: here is ſuch fitting up and pulling down, with ſuch wiſe and buſy faces, popping about from one apartment to another, while I, who am the cauſe of all the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, am as calm and compoſed as poſſible. At leaſt, my countenance and demeanor ſay ſo; but I have many ſerious thoughts, and many a tear and many a ſigh is given to the memory of the time when I looked forward to the nuptial hour with different ſenſations; but that muſt be forgotten.

                     <p>IT is paſt, my friend—and I am now the wife of Mr. Rookſby. It is juſt a week, ſince at the altar, I pledged my faith to love and honour him to the lateſt period of his exiſtence. Well Celia, I will keep this vow moſt religiouſly; at leaſt I will eſteem him and love no other, and whilſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is ſuch as demands honour, I will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him. Should he ever fail in any of the grand moral duties, I will bear it with meekneſs, pity him and endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim him. I will be a faithful wife in every ſenſe of the word.</p>
                     <p>The day on which I gave him my hand, was indeed to me a tremendous one.—Kingly was preſent, nay he even gave me to his couſin. I trembled when he took my hand, a faint ſickiſh ſenſation come over
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:029439_0381_0FE1172B72949008"/>
me: but I rallied my ſpirits and went through the ceremony tolerably well. My dear Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, whom you might ſuppoſe would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent on this important occaſion, kept up my ſpirits during the reſt of the day. Mrs. Kingly looked happy, but it was a kind of ſatiſfaction tempered with fear.—"I hope" ſaid ſhe," preſſing my hand, "I hope the aera of your felicity may be dated from this propitious day."—"Moſt certainly it will," cried Amelia, "for who ever heard of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery in a coach and ſix."—"Oh!" replied Mrs. Kingly, with great energy, "there is much greater miſery in them than thoſe who lack the goods of fortune will readily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, aye, my dear Miſs Sidney, and the worſt kind of miſery too, ſuch as wealth cannot relieve or grandeur alleviate."</p>
                     <p>"Well," ſaid Amelia, laughing, "I declare we have choſen a brilliant topic for a wedding day, but pray let us change it. I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways more inclined to become a diſciple of the laughing, rather than the weeping phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher."</p>
                     <p>When it drew near dinner time and I found I muſt deſcend into the drawing room, I trembled from the idea of being preſented to about half a hundred ſtrangers, who would compliment, and criticiſe at a
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:029439_0382_0FE1172FA8CB1998"/>
moſt unmerciful rate; the one to my face, the other behind my back, and believe me I would ſooner liſten to the latter than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> former: for compliments have in general little or no meaning and of courſe are mere inſipid trifles. Now in liſtening to the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſms of our friendly neighbours, who perhaps did not intend we ſhould over hear them, we diſcover our faults, and may learn how to amend them; but the miſfortune is, few will take the trouble to point out our errors to us, while every one is ready to flatter our ſelf love, by commending us for qualifications to which we have little or no pretenſions, and, if they think, we believe their aſſertions, the moment we quit them they will laugh at our credulity. Well! my dear Celia, I never could bring myſelf to make compliments, or fine ſpeeches to people, whom I did not think deſerved them. But to return to my ſubject—</p>
                     <p>I got through the day tolerably well, and now our gueſts begin to think of returning to their reſpective homes. It is propoſed, that we ſtay at Oak-hall till the latter end of November. Mrs. Rookſby has prevailed on Mrs. Sidney to remain with her, during the winter, while Amelia accompanies me to town. I am vaſtly pleaſed with the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement, as the ſociety of that dear girl
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:029439_0383_0FE1173459137EA0"/>
will be a great comfort to me. I find Rookſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by has given orders for a houſe to be fitted up in a ſtile of the utmoſt elegance, as he intends we ſhall always paſs the winters in town and the ſummers with his mother at the Hall. He talks of much grandeur and gaity. I am ſorry for it, I think his taſte very expenſive; but it is not my place to ſpeak. I am determined to regulate my own expences, by the ſtrict rule of economy, void of parſimony. Even was the wealth my own, I have no right to ſquander it away in unneceſſary trifles, and as it is not, I muſt be ſtill more careful. My allowance for pocket money, cards, &amp;c. is extremely li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral, and I hope always to order it in ſuch a manner as to have a ſufficient ſum by me, to aſſiſt depreſſed merit, or reſcue ſuffering innocence from oppreſſion. I hope, my dear Celia, elevated as my preſent ſituation is, I ſhall never forget the uſeful leſſons taught me in the ſchool of adverſity; and ſurely, whilſt the remembrance of my own ſufferings are retained, my heart will never be rendered callous to the ſufferings of others. Oh! My beloved friend, dearly indeed ſhould I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the ſmiles of fortune, if I am to loſe my humanity. Benificent Ruler of the Univerſe, teach me to value the bleſſings bountifully ſhowered upon me, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly remembering my own deſerts; and
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:029439_0384_0FE117395D473188"/>
whenever I meet an afflicted fellow-creature, let my heart ſhew its gratitude to Thee, by dropping the tear of ſympathy, and granting the tribute of relief."—I am certain, Celia, they who have never known adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, cannot truly enjoy proſperity. I forgot to tell you, that Kingly left us the day after we were married. Mrs. Kingly ſtays, till we all go to London. When we are ſettled there, I will write you again; but you muſt not expect any great variety in my letters; I muſt, I ſuppoſe, at firſt enter into the gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the metropolis, but I am determined not to be ſo infatuated as to give up my whole time to them. I will have my hours of peace and retirement: for in my opinion the life that is ſpent in a continued round of inſipid pleaſures, is not only entirely uſeleſs to ſociety, but in ſome meaſure guilty, as we can have no time for the performance of thoſe duties, which are incumbent on every profeſſor of Chriſtianity; nor do I think as many do, that people of a certain rank in life may paſs their time in any way moſt agreeable to themſelves, and that they are not accountable for it to any one. We certainly are anſwerable to one, who will demand an account of our ſtewardſhip at a time, when no evaſion whatever will ſerve our turn: and the more elevated our ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the more careful we ſhould be to
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:029439_0385_0FE1173E9BE0B030"/>
ſet examples worthy the imitation of our inferiors. Examples that may inſpire all, who know us with a love of virtue, be an honour to ourſelves, and a benefit to ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in general.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Rookſby aſked me, to whom I was writing. To the friend of my early days, I replied. We were educated in the ſame convent. Miſs Shelburne choſe to take the veil—I was of a different religion, and have been called into the buſy ſcenes of life, but the affections of our youth are always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered with peculiar pleaſure; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when reaſon approves the election our hearts had made in the days of childhood. I am certain, my dear Meriel, ſaid he, ſhe muſt be amiable, or ſhe would not be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with your eſteem.</p>
                     <p>You are a flatterer, ſaid, I ſmiling, but if you knew Celia half ſo well as I do, you would know ſhe was worthy of the love of every good heart. I will not repeat his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, my friend, as it would favour too much of vanity, if he is as gallant and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der twelve months hence, I may perhaps, ſtand a good chance for claiming the <hi>flitch of bacon.</hi> He bids me preſent his beſt wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to you.

                     <p>I HAVE been in town above a week; but could not command an hour to devote to friendſhip and Celia. Indeed, I have been ſo taken up with mantua-makers, mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liners and toymen, I hardly know what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to give of the laſt ſeven days; then what with here and there a particular friend, who requeſted to be admitted, before my appearance at court gave the ſignal for the whole town to come and paſs their opinion on my houſe-furniture, &amp;c. I have been wearied to death with a conſtant ſucceſſion of impertinant viſitors, who are thus over polite, for no other reaſon than the eager de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they have to report the diſcoveries they make in regard to my perſon, dreſs and
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:029439_0387_0FE1174721B4A598"/>
manner, to the whole circle of their acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but in this they have been ſadly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, for I have received them all in a ſmall back drawing-room, and have never yet varied my dreſs from a neat diſhabille.</p>
                     <p>I am now ſummoned to the drawing room: ſome new ſet of inquiſitives, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, well, I muſt attend; for people of faſhion live not for themſelves, but others. They are afraid to perform any action, if unfaſhionable, though ever ſo right, leaſt they ſhould be laughed at: and for the very ſame cauſe dare not refuſe to do any thing to which faſhion gives a ſanction, though rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon tells them it is wrong, and ſhould be avoided.</p>
                     <p>I muſt leave you Celia.</p>
                     <p>And who do you imagine my viſitors were? Now would I venture to lay a conſiderable wager, your mind would glance over the whole circle of my acquaintance, without being able to gueſs the right. So to ſave you the trouble of conjecture, I will at once inform you. They were no other than my kind aunt Moſſop and her two amiable daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. I do declare, Celia, when I ſaw them in the drawing room I abſolutely bluſhed for
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:029439_0388_0FE1174BB5EEF608"/>
them. However, they did not ſeem to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience any embarraſſment; but paid their compliments with the ſame eaſy air, as if nothing had ever interrupted our intimacy; only with this difference, their language and manner was more reſpectful.</p>
                     <p>"You have been very fly, my dear," ſaid my aunt, "never to let us know where you were all this time, and then to blaze upon us all at once a ſplendid bride."</p>
                     <p>"I thought, madam, after the death of my father, you would feel but little inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted about the fate of his daughter, for whom you never appeared to have any great degree of partiality."</p>
                     <p>"Bleſs me, Mrs. Rookſby, you are vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtaken. I was always extremely partial to you, and I am ſure Heſter and Suſan have talked of you many times, ſince laſt we had the pleaſure of ſeeing you. We wondered what had become of you."</p>
                     <p>"I have ſeen a variety of ſcenes," ſaid I, "nor would it have been in the leaſt probable ſhould meet with ſo advantageous a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as I have, had it not been for the friendſhip of a young lady, whom I have once or twice ſeen at your houſe, and who
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:029439_0389_0FE11750D7691A60"/>
at preſent does me the honour to make one of my family." I then rang the bell, and deſired the ſervant to inform Miſs Sidney we requeſted the favour of her company. I ſaw my couſins look at each other when Amelia's name was mentioned, Mrs. Moſſop changed countenance. "Bleſs me," ſaid Heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, "I was thinking of Miſs Sidney, the other day: but we have been in town ſo very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, we have ſeen nobody—this is poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively the firſt viſit we have made." When Amelia entered the room, I ſaw ſhe was aſtoniſhed: I alſo ſaw the conſtraint and confuſion which my viſitors vainly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to hide under the maſk of extreme pleaſure at the accidental meeting. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as I imagined, my couſins courted my notice merely in the hope of ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my parties, and throwing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the way of men of rank and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, I gave them a general invitation to my houſe, and I ſincerely wiſh the event may anſwer their ſanguine expectations, as it would give me great ſatiſfaction to ſee them married to worthy men, poſſeſſed of fortunes capable of ſupporting them in the manner to which they have been accuſtomed, and which I fear they could not continue, was their father to die before they are ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled; as he could not leave them a large fortune, having in general lived up to the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:029439_0390_0FE117544B7AEF30"/>
extent of his income. Young Moſſop is, I find, in the Weſt Indies.—Is it not ſtrange, my dear Celia, that I have heard nothing of my brother theſe two years paſt. However he has forgot me. I often think of him; I pray for his health and proſperity, and ſhould rejoice to ſee him return with an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſufficient to place him in a reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſituation.—Oh Celia, this continual round of viſitors, by no means ſuits the taſte of your friend.

                     <p>MY little Clementina, is grown the fineſt girl you can imagine; and I aſſure you, grandmamma is not a little proud of her darling. I wiſhed the dear little charmer to have been called Frederica, but I dared not ſay ſo, leaſt it ſhould be thought improper. Laſt night, my dear Amelia arrived: her ſpirits are greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the death of her excellent mother, but as ſhe will be happy in the friendſhip and protection of Mrs. Rookſby, I hope ſoon to ſee her chearfulneſs reſtored. I have got ſuch a habit of ſeizing every leiſure moment to ſcribble to my Celia, that I often
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:029439_0392_0FE1175F0397E430"/>
take up my pen, when I have really nothing to ſay. You rejoice, you tell me to find my happineſs increaſe. Indeed, my dear friend I experience a much larger ſhare than ſome years ſince, I could have imagined would have ever fallen to my lot. Mr. Rookſby is ſtill the kind, the attentive huſband, and the birth of my little girl ſeems more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to cement our union.</p>
                     <p>You cannot think, how ſurpriſed I was a few days before we left town. Mr. Rookſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by had been out in the morning, and on his return told me he had met with an old friend whom he had invited home to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner." He is a man," ſaid he, "with whom I formed an acquaintance when we were both boys at the ſame ſchool together, I have not ſeen him for ſome time, but I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought him a worthy fellow, and am now happy in the renewal of our intimacy." He did not mention the name of his friend. You may judge therefore what was my aſtoniſhment, when juſt before dinner a ſervant announced Mr. Belger. I know not why it was, but I felt myſelf ſtange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embarraſſed while he was paying his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments. Mr. Belger too was ſurpriſed, and looked abaſhed at the unexpected ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, for I had not ſeen him ſince the cold wet night when we parted at the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:029439_0393_0FE117644DE0CF88"/>
end of Kenſington. However, I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately accoſted him by name and turning to Mr. Rookſby endeavoured at a ſmile, while I ſaid, "This is an old acquaintance of mine too, though I dare ſay Mr. Belger had not the moſt diſtant idea of ſeeing me here." I then enquired after Mrs. Belger and Emma.</p>
                     <p>"Emma is abroad in a convent, madam," he replied—"and, her mother"—He heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, and I at that moment perceiving he was dreſſed in ſecond mourning, inſtantly underſtood his meaning. I felt my eyes fill. I remembered her gentleneſs and affection, and I alſo remembered how ill that affection had been requited.</p>
                     <p>"And pray, my dear," ſaid Mr. Rookſby, "where were you acquainted with my friend Belger?"—At Kenſington," I replied.—</p>
                     <p>"At Kenſington!" ſaid he with viſible emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion "Did you know many perſons there."</p>
                     <p>"Very few, indeed; for at that time I was not in a ſituation to receive many viſitants."</p>
                     <p>I did not chooſe, my dear Celia, to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion having known Mrs. Moreton; as ſhe was undoubtedly a woman of light character,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:029439_0394_0FE1176723826C70"/>
the being ſuppoſed, an intimate of ſuch a woman, would by no means contribute to raiſe me in Mr. Rookſby's opinion, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavoured to give the converſation a different turn, and dinner being ſoon after announced, it aſſiſted my deſign, and we ſpoke afterwards only on indifferent ſubjects.—I am by no means pleaſed with Belger's being on an intimate footing in our family, he is not a proper companion for Rookſby, I am certain he is of libertine principles, fond of gaming and diſſipated in his manners, yet greatly as I diſlike him, I dare not mention it to Mr. Rookſby, as he ſeems extremely fond of him and places the moſt implicit confidence in his honour, and has actually invited him to paſs ſome weeks this ſummer with us here, I am mortified and vexed, Amelia laughs at me, when I mention my anxiety and ſays, he will now be fearful of inſulting me by any mention of his love. While I was unprotected he could treat me with diſreſpect, without fear of being called to an account, now it is quite a different affair.—Indeed, Celia, this is not what I dread, but I think if Mr. Rookſby ſhould by any means hear how intimate we once were, he would be diſpleaſed, and it might be the cauſe of great uneaſineſs between us, I ſhall take particular care to avoid all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of being entertained alone by this
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:029439_0395_0FE1176CAD9C6440"/>
man, and feel happy in the reflection that while I am in the country I ſhall have Amelia conſtantly with me.</p>

                     <p>Since I began my letter I have been ſo agitated and diſtreſſed I found myſelf totally unequal to the taſk of finiſhing it. Now I have ſat down for that purpoſe, I hardly know how to arrange the extraordinary events that have happened within theſe laſt twelve days, not am I certain that you, my dear Celia, will entirely approve of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; yet ſure you will not greatly condemn me: for your gentle heart is benevolence itſelf. On the evening of the day on which I began my letter, I could not but obſerve that Mr. Rookſby was extremely thoughtful and grave, a thing with him very uncommon, as his uſual demeanor is chearful, and his converſation lively.—Once or twice, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> thought (for I obſerved him narrowly,) I ſaw the tears ſtart in his eyes, he ſighed deeply and often. His mother remarked his want of ſpirits and inquired if he was well. His anſwer was, "yes madam, very well, but rather out of ſpirits, I ſhall be better to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, do not pay any attention to it."—I thought it was beſt not to ſpeak, leaſt urgent inquiries might encrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="66" facs="unknown:029439_0396_0FE117709FF69E00"/>
his evident depreſſion; and in caſe any family affair had occaſioned his uneaſineſs I was ſenſible he would not chooſe to mention it before his mother and Amelia.—I therefore determined to let it reſt, if he thought it right that I ſhould be informed of the cauſe, he would the firſt convenient opportunity communicate it; if not, it would I naturally ſuppoſed only increaſe his vexation to be teized with impertinent inquiries. When we retired he ſpoke but little, ſeemed buried in thought, and I am certain, ſlept little all night. This was too much—I felt my heart partake of his uneaſineſs, though I was ignorant of its origin. I longed to lighten his anxiety by participation;—Yet, feared to be troubleſome.—After breakfaſt perceiving his dejection rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe than diminiſh, I followed him into the ſhrubbery, and finding him ſitting in a melancholy, muſing poſture, ſeated myſelf beſide him, and laying my hand on his arm, ſaid with a voice, that evidently ſpoke my tender ſolicitude—</p>
                     <p>"Rookſby you are not happy."</p>
                     <p>"I am not, indeed, my dear Meriel, I am very far from it; but do not let it interrupt your tranquillity. The cauſe of my preſent dejection will ſoon be removed, and then I
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:029439_0397_0FE117769D5E6EC0"/>
ſhall again enjoy with pleaſure the ſociety of the beſt of wives; but at preſent, my love, I muſt requeſt you to leave me, as I am unfit for converſation."</p>
                     <p>"And can you, Rookſby, think me wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the flattering appelation you juſt now gave me, and yet ſuppoſe me capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of preſerving my tranquillity while I ſee you unhappy."</p>
                     <p>"You know, my ſweet girl, I think you all, that is good and amiable in woman, and it is for your peace of mind I would endeavour to hide my unhappineſs."</p>
                     <p>"But as you connot hide it from the eye of affection, then refuſe me not the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, my dear Rookſby of at leaſt participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. If I cannot alleviate your anxiety, ſurely you cannot fear to place a confidence in the choſen friend of your heart."</p>
                     <p>"Oh no! but I know it will give you no pleaſure to be informed, nay, I fear it would rather make you unhappy in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent degree."</p>
                     <p>"Then it is ſomething of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence either to your honour or intereſt, or perhaps to both: if ſo, I muſt one day
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:029439_0398_0FE1177B403B0178"/>
know it, and ſure the tidings will not give me ſo much pain from you, as from the lips of another."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! my gentle love, do not preſs me, you have no idea of what my heart at this moment ſuffers, while I refuſe to gratify your laudable curioſity. Yes, my dear Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riel—I know the only incentive to be thus preſſing, is a generous wiſh to relieve my anxiety; but believe me, you cannot form the remoteſt idea of the cauſe. If you could, you would look on me with a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of horror and diſguſt."</p>
                     <p>"Say not ſo, Rookſby; do not think ſo meanly of your wife as to ſuppoſe her capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of thinking of you a moment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affection, without an ardent wiſh to ſee you as perfectly happy, as it is poſſible for mortal to be."</p>
                     <p>"Can, my deareſt life, think of no inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that might happen, that would wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken her affection towards me."</p>
                     <p>"None.—Were it poſſible, (but I know it not) that forgetful of your vows, you could prove falſe to your Meriel ſhe could never forget that you had raiſed her from
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:029439_0399_0FE117806111F528"/>
indigence! that you were her huſband! and the father of her child!"</p>
                     <p>"Deareſt, beſt of womankind—falſe to thee! No—rather ſhould my heart ceaſe to beat. I ſee your heroic ſpirit is adequate to any trial; no longer will I keep you in ſuſpenſe. I have ſeen Clara."—</p>
                     <p>"And, is that all!—fye! Rookſby, fye! could you think that would give me a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments pain. Believe me were it in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be of the leaſt ſervice to Mrs. Millar, I would inſtantly fly to do it.</p>
                     <p>"Angelic goodneſs! but could you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed forgive her."</p>
                     <p>"I have no right to call her too account, my dear Rookſby, for her errors: but tell me, is ſhe in diſtreſs. If ſo, I know ſhe is my fellow creature, and it is my duty to relieve her."</p>
                     <p>"Meriel," (ſaid he catching me in his arms) while tears of exultation burſt from his eyes, "you ſurpaſs even the elevated idea I had formed of your prudence and virtue, Clara is in diſtreſs, I met her yeſterday, with ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloaths to ſhield her from the inclemency of the weather. She told me ſhe had paſt

the two laſt nights in th e open air, expoſed to nocturnal damps; that lovely form that once was ſhielded by a tender huſband from even the moſt trifling inconvenience, had nought to reſt upon but the cold earth, no canopy but heaven,—and two days had paſt ſince ſhe had taſted food."—</p>
                     <p>"Merciful heaven, ſaid I, (while my eyes overflowed,) why have I been kept thus long in ignorance, were is ſhe, let us go, my dear Rookſby, ſhall I quietly enjoy the luxuries of life while poor Clara is in want of even the neceſſaries."</p>
                     <p>"I relieved her at the time, my love. Do not feel ſo acutely, I even promiſed again to ſee her; but my heart ſmote me, I thought ſhould it reach your ears, you would think me the baſeſt of mankind."</p>
                     <p>I ſhould think you ſo, indeed, were you capable of beholding unmoved the miſeries of a woman, with whom you once lived on terms of the greateſt familiarity: but we are loſing time. Let us haſten to the poor ſufferer. Who knows, but we may lead her back to the paths of virtue? But hold! You ſhall go alone, Rookſby. She may conſider my preſence as an inſult."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="71" facs="unknown:029439_0401_0FE1178A0B5A4BB8"/>
"She muſt, if ſhe reflects at all, my dear Meriel, think it the higheſt condeſcention; and if you will be ſo generous as to viſit and promiſe her your protection, I will write her a note to prepare her for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview, and you ſhall ſee her in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon."</p>
                     <p>"You will accompany me then?"</p>
                     <p>"No, dear girl, I will not. After what has paſt, it is impoſſible to doubt either your delicacy or generoſity. You ſhall act entirely as your own heart directs. I am ſure by leaving you to its dictates, Clara will have no reaſon to complain: but let me intreat you not to mention this affair, either to my mother or Miſs Sidney. I am ſure they would blame the generous ardour with which you eſpouſe the cauſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Clara."</p>
                     <p>"I promiſed ſilence, and we returned to the houſe, Rookſby all life, ſpirit and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; and I planing fifty different ſchemes for Clara's future ſupport. At dinner Mrs. Rookſby was quite happy to ſee Clement's chearfulneſs returned; and Miſs Sidney was too delicate and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to aſk any queſtions concerning his late dejection and abſence of mind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="72" facs="unknown:029439_0402_0FE1178CC7134B68"/>
About five o'clock the chariot came to the, door, and Rookſby handed me in, telling me the coachman knew where to drive, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay but during my little ride, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went great agitation of ſpirits, I am certainly doing right, thought I, in offering my protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the unfortunate Clara, and did not hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity point out my duty, ſelf-intereſt would urge me to a performance of it, for ſhould I not prove a friend to Clara, Rookſby undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would; and ſenſible, as I was, of the undue influence ſhe once had over him, I could not but fear, that influence might again be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted to his ruin: Beſides, ſaid I, who knows but Clara, had ſhe been bleſt with friends to direct her, and counſel her aright might at this moment have been a ſhining member of ſociety. Alas, it might have been my fate to wander forlorn and unprotected thro' the world, had it not been for the interpoſition of providence, who ſo wonderfully inclined the heart of the friendly Mr. Welldon to grant me ſuccour and relief; and ſhall I who have experienced ſuch bleſſings and ſupport from an All Governing power, refuſe my feeble aſſiſtance to raiſe from ſorrow and infamy, a poor fallen ſiſter. Oh no! That ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignant Power has pointed out my duty in the cleareſt manner, and I truſt will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to be backward in the performance
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:029439_0403_0FE117924A174468"/>
of it.—Fully occupied by theſe and ſimilar reflections, I hardly perceived what route the carriage had taken, till it ſtopped at the door of a ſmall neat cottage. A wholeſome looking young woman preſented herſelf. I enquired for Mrs. Millar and was ſhewn into a parlour and informed ſhe would wait on me immediately. I was ſcarcely ſeated when the door opened, and (judge if poſſible my ſurprize,) Mrs. Moreton entered.—An exclamation of wonder eſcaped me. Oh! Madam, ſaid ſhe, and unable to articulate more, ſunk on the neareſt chair, covered her face with her hands and burſt into tears.</p>
                     <p>"Be not alarmed," ſaid I, in the gentleſt accent I could aſſume, "you have nothing to fear from me. But tell me do you live in this houſe, and are you any ways connected with the unfortunate Mrs. Millar."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! dear lady," ſaid ſhe, (ſinking on her knees and raiſing her ſtreaming eyes to my face) "I am that unhappy wretch, I am that ungrateful monſter who have injured (though Heaven knows involuntarily,) the very wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who now generouſly comes to ſave me from deſpair."</p>
                     <p>I was greatly affected, my dear Celia, I raiſed the afflicted penitent, and bade her be comforted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="unknown:029439_0404_0FE1179769C78E80"/>
"Comfort!" exclaimed ſhe vehemently, "Alas! where can a wretch, whoſe crimes are ſo multiplied as mine, find it?"</p>
                     <p>"It is never denied to the truly penitent: and I hope you will experience its benign influence."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall! I begin to feel it already dawn on my benighted ſoul. It comes adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by an angel's hand."</p>
                     <p>I then made ſome enquiries concerning her preſent ſituation, and requeſted to be informed, in what manner I could render her ſervice which would be moſt acceptable.</p>
                     <p>"You cannot, my dear Madam," ſaid ſhe, "judge how far I am worthy your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, unleſs you will permit me to acquaint you with the chief incidents of my paſt life. I know at this moment, I appear to you an unworthy unprincipled wretch. When I think of the ſituation, in which I left you at Kenſington, I cannot but reflect how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle I ſhould expect from your hands. Nay that my very life is in your power, but when I ſhall inform how much I ſuffered for the unintentional injury I did you, I flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf you will pity and forgive me."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="75" facs="unknown:029439_0405_0FE1179CA882E920"/>
"But I muſt inſiſt," ſaid I, "that you do not enter upon this detail till your ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is rendered more comfortable than it is at preſent."</p>
                     <p>"Permit me," ſaid ſhe, interrupting me, "to remain at this cottage a few days. In that time, I will endeavour to commit to your peruſal a written account of my miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable life, from the earlieſt period of recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection till now. I am ſenſible you will find much to blame—but, alas! you will find much more to awaken your compaſſion.—My crimes, though many, have not been my own: but my afflictions are I have neither friend or relation to conſole, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, or alleviate my anguiſh."</p>
                     <p>The agony her countenance expreſſed, as ſhe uttered this, is not to be deſcribed. I felt her ſolitary, forlorn ſituation, and while the tear of ſympathy trembled in my eye, I breathed forth the accents of conſolation.—When ſhe grew more compoſed, I aroſe to take my leave;—but was ſadly at a loſs how to offer the aſſiſtance I was ſenſible ſhe wanted, without hurting her feelings. At length I ventured to draw forth my purſe. She laid her hand on my arm—"That is entirely needleſs." ſaid ſhe, "Mr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

thus oppreſſed with obligation, till ſome way is pointed out for me in ſome meaſure to ſhow my gratitude."—"Call it not an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation," ſaid I, "It is only a debt due from the happy to the unfortunate." "I have one requeſt to make dear madam," ſaid ſhe "ſuffer me then to decline this offered favour in hopes you will grant me the one nearer my heart."—"Name it," ſaid I.—"It is," ſhe replied, "that you will forbear men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the circumſtances that paſt at Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington to Mr. Rookſby, till you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my letter. After that you will think of me with more clemency than you do at preſent."</p>
                     <p>I bade her be quite eaſy in that reſpect, and leaving the purſe on the table returned to the Hall, where I found Mrs. Rookſby and Amelia wonderfully curious to know where I had been. "To keep a particular appointment I aſſure you," ſaid Clement, "and as I am the only confident, that is truſted in the affair, I beg you will not be inquiſitive concerning it; for I have promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſecrecy."</p>
                     <p>He did not make any enquiry of what had paſſed at our interview, but pointedly avoided the ſubject. The next morning he preſented me with two hundred pounds, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

"My dear Meriel's expences may at this time be greater than uſual. Make uſe of this my love, and ſhould you require more, you know where to apply." This ſum I ſhall look upon as the property of Clara, and when we have ſettled ſome plan for her future ſupport, it ſhall be appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted entirely to her uſe. I was very impatient for the promiſed letter, as I imagined it almoſt impoſſible for her to extenuate a conduct ſo unjuſt and cruel as hers had been toward me; but reſolved at all events to judge as candidly as poſſible, and extend toward her a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which may awaken in her mind a juſt ſenſe of her paſt errors, and lead her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly to the love and practice of virtue. At length the long expected packet arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. I ſend a copy for my dear Celia's pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal. Oh! my friend, when you have peruſed it, you will like me, ſhed tears of ſympathy over poor Clara's ſufferings, till her offences are blotted from your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.—Farewell, my Celia.

Madam, the heart not entirely rendered callous by guilt, ſhrinks from the ſcrutinizing eye of ſuperior virtue, yet painful as the taſk is, I feel it is a duty I owe, to you, to myſelf, and to my dear for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken children.—I am not, madam, as my ſiſter-in-law repreſented to Mr. Rookſby, the daughter of a decayed officer; Alas! my friendſhip with this cruel ſiſter, has been the chief cauſe of all my guilt and miſery. My father was a gentleman of genteel fortune, and unſullied reputation. I was his only child, and at the age of thirteen having loſt my mother was placed at a boarding ſchool near Oxford, where I received a genteel edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and to my utter regret formed an acquaintance with Eleanor Ramſay, ſhe was
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:029439_0409_0FE117AF1FAFD100"/>
five years older than myſelf and was a teacher in this ſchool, ſhe had an expenſive taſte for dreſs, and was paſſionately fond of gaiety and pleaſure. My father made me a liberal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for my pocket expenſes. Eleanor was not ſo amply ſupplied, ſhe told me that her father had been dead for ſome years and her mother's income was extremely confined tho' ſhe ſtrained it to the utmoſt in order that herſelf and brother might have the benefit of a liberal education.—Young Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay was a genteel engaging youth, and at that time employed in the ſtudy of the law. He frequently came to viſit his ſiſter, and ſometimes took her to places of public enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, in which excurſions I was impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently allowed to accompany them. Ramſay pretended to be ſtruck with my perſon; but I have ſince been convinced the fortune my father poſſeſſed and of which I was ſuppoſed heireſs, was the chief incentive to the paſſion he ſo ardently profeſſed. Eleanor was plain in her perſon, but artful and inſinuating in her manner. She conſtantly contrived par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of pleaſure, in which I was included: and in return I ſupplied her with money to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe any article of finery which her own narrow allowance would not afford.—</p>
                     <p>In this manner we proceeded till I reached my ſixteenth year, when on receiving a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:029439_0410_0FE117B403A07B68"/>
from my father to prepare to quit ſchool entirely, Ramſay and his ſiſter ſhewed ſuch marks of affliction at our approaching ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the former declaring his exiſtence depended on my conſtancy and affection; that giddy, thoughtleſs, and eaſily perſuaded, I conſented to an elopement and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied theſe falſe friends to Scotland, where I ſealed myſelf the moſt wretched of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mankind, by uniting myſelf to an unprinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled wretch, in whoſe whole family there was not one atom of honour or generoſity.—On our return we haſtened to my father and humbly requeſted his pardon and bleſſing.—Alas! I had forfeited all claim to both. He ſpurned me from him, and declared he would never ſee my face again. Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with affliction, I had now no courſe to take, but to repair with my huſband to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to his mother and ſiſter, who, I thought, received me very coldly, conſidering how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly they had ſtrove to promote the union. Even Ramſay himſelf was much altered in his manner and I began to perceive, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered me as a burthen. I wrote a moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netential letter to my father, requeſting to be received, and offering to quit a man, whom I found my heart was by no means attached to; but the anſwer I received was, that as I had voluntarily quitted his protection for that of a huſband, and taken the liberty to
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:029439_0411_0FE117B913B51AE0"/>
chooſe for myſelf, without conſulting him on the propriety of my choice, I muſt take the conſequence of my precipitancy: but, he feared, if I paid as little regard to the duties of a wife, as I had done to thoſe of a daughter, my huſband would ſoon have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to repent our union. He encloſed me a note for two hundred pounds, declaring it was all I muſt ever expect, as he had made his will in favour of a ſiſter's ſon then abroad in the navy. This money proved a ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able relief, as Mrs. Ramſay's affairs were greatly deranged; but it was ſoon expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I was again reduced to bear the ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature of all the family; for Ramſay never entertained a thought of giving me even an apartment to myſelf, nor indeed was it in his power, as he had no employment by which we could hope to be ſupported. We had been married about a twelve-month, when he received an offer of accompanying a young gentleman abroad. This he eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accepted, and I was left with Mrs. Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay. My ſituation was as uncomfortable as you can poſſibly imagine, I had not money even for neceſſary expences, and I could not help perceiving, that even my food was grudged by my mother-in-law. I thought once more of making a perſonal application to my father, but to my great affliction he at that time died ſuddenly, and all hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>property
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:029439_0412_0FE117BBEB7A8610"/>
devolved to the relation I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned. Though Mrs. Ramſay's finances were very confined, ſhe lived in an expenſive manner, kept a good deal of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and went frequently into public. One night being with her at the play, we were accoſted by an elderly gentleman, who ſat in the box with us, ſhewed us many civilities during the evening, and when the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ended, inſiſted on ſetting us down at our own door in his carriage, I thought there was an impropriety in accepting theſe civilities from a perfect ſtranger; but as my mother and ſiſter acquieſced, I knew it would only be deemed prudery in me to reſiſt.—I, therefore, followed their example, and ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the carriage. When we arrived at home, the gentleman aſked permiſſion to enquire after our health the enſuing morning, which was granted. On our entering the houſe I began to rally Eleanor on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt ſhe had made, as I naturally imagined theſe civilities were intended for her, but Mrs. Ramſay cried with more good humour than I had heard her ſpeak for ſome time.—"No, no! my dear, Eleanor has no right to the glory of the conqueſt, I fancy it is you, my pretty Clara, who have attracted the old gentleman's notice; Eleanor's perſon is not adapted for making conqueſts.—"I hope you are miſtaken, madam," I replied;
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:029439_0413_0FE117C1DA087590"/>
"for I ſhould greatly rejoice in any good fortune which may happen to my ſiſter. For my own part, my lot is caſt."</p>
                     <p>The next morning, Mr. Millar (for it was he, who had accoſted us the night before) called, and after chatting ſome time on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different ſubjects, offered to take us that evening to Ranelagh. From this time an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy commenced, and I ſoon really un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that my unfortunate perſon had been the object of his purſuit. It was in vain I remonſtrated on the impropriety of a married woman liſtening to overtures of love. Mrs. Ramſay treated the remonſtrance as folly and romance. What ſhall I ſay, my dear madam, ill treated at home, diſtreſſed in my circumſtances no friend near to whom I could apply for advice or aſſiſtance. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly gave way to the deluſions of ſplendor and affluence, and one evening at a maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade conſented to my ruin.—A few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this fatal night, I went with Mr. Millar to Oxford, which was the place of his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Eleanor accompanied me and I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the name of Millar. As I had not received a line from my huſband ſince his departure from England, I imagined he had totally forgot me and would be as happy to be releaſed from the burthen of maintaining
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:029439_0414_0FE117C539BBD0D0"/>
me, as he once pretended he ſhould be in obtaining my hand.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Millar was extremely fond of me, I endeavoured as much as was in my power to return this affection with gratitude; but alas! madam, I was far from happy. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious guilt had fixed her fangs in my boſom and knowing myſelf unworthy the attentions I daily received from the virtuous part of my ſex. I began to envy a ſuperiority, the conſciouſneſs of which had given me ſo much pain; but though I was far from hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py I had not yet taſted the miſery of loving one object, while I felt myſelf bound to another. That ſuperlative exceſs of anguiſh was reſerved for me, 'till accident introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Mr. Millar to Mr. Rookſby. I will not repeat the ſteps I took, (tears of contrition bathe my cheeks while I write it) to deceive the worthy Mr. Millar, and indulge my ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for Rookſby. Suffice it to ſay I gave a looſe to love, and experienced its effects with more violence, as it was the firſt time my heart had ever been ſenſible of the paſſion; and certain it is, when we have taken one ſtep in guilt we never pauſe at a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or a third, when either intereſt or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure urges our purſuit. You have no doubt been informed of my leaving Mr. Millar and following Mr. Rookſby to town; I
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:029439_0415_0FE117CAC86F1A78"/>
ſhall therefore paſs over every circumſtance that enſued until my acquaintance with you, (then Miſs Howard) at Mrs. La Cours, and your ſubſequent removal to Kenſington. At that time I had relinquiſhed the name of Millar; but as I had an invincible averſion to that of Ramſay, and Mr. Rookſby refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me his, I aſſumed my own maiden name of Moreton. While I reſided at Kenſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, I received Mr. Rookſby's viſits very privately, as he was anxious for me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my character, and I wiſhed to appear to you in the light of an amiable woman. I ſaw you regarded me with eſteem, and I knew your heart too well to ſuppoſe that eſteem would be continued, if you knew I was a ſlave to guilty paſſion.—Believe me, deareſt, beſt of womankind, I never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an idea to your diſadvantage. I wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from my ſoul to promote your welfare, and have taught my heart to rejoice in your proſperity, though that proſperity has torn from my agonized heart every earthly good: but to proceed—The day before I called on you and beſpoke the linen for my ſiſter Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, I had received a note from Mrs. Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay informing me that a particular relation was come to town, and as they were unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my connection with Mr. Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, &amp;c. and ſtill regarded me as the wife of her ſon, ſhe wiſhed me to come to town
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:029439_0416_0FE117CDF0EAD7A8"/>
and make them a viſit, taking the eldeſt child with me. On the morning preceding the day on which this viſit was to be paid, Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor let my watch fall, and without acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me with the circumſtance ſent it to have the damage repaired. You know what followed. I went to town; but, alas! on my arrival at my mother's, who ſhould I meet but my unworthy huſband. I now too late diſcovered that my ſiſter had been in the plot to betray me. He inſtantly claimed me, as his lawful wife, and inſiſted on my accompanying him abroad, from whence, he ſaid, he had only returned to fetch me; as he had through the intereſt of his friend, obtained a very reſpectable place under the French government. It was in vain to remonſtrate. I was was obliged to comply, and early the next morning we ſet off for Dover, leaving the children with Mrs. Ramſay. On our arrival in that place, it was too late to think of croſſing the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel that night. We therefore beſpoke a paſſage on board a packet, and as it was to ſail by five o'clock the next morning, we retired early to bed. But judge, dear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, if poſſible, my anguiſh and ſurprize, when awaking about ſeven o'clock, I found my huſband and ſiſter had left me, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with them my trunks containing all my clothes, jewels, money, &amp;c. leaving me
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:029439_0417_0FE117D3D51458D8"/>
nothing but about ſix guineas which I had in my pocket.</p>
                     <p>I aroſe with a heavy heart, and ordered ſome breakfaſt. While I was taking my ſolitary meal, I thought I heard a voice that was familiar to my ears, and inquiring of the maid who attended what company was then in the houſe, I learnt that Mr. Rookyſby was there on his way to France, and that the packet he had taken for himſelf and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants did not ſail till the next tide. I then remembered his informing me at his laſt viſit, that he ſhould be obliged to viſit the continent before he could ſee me again, and overjoyed to find him in the ſame houſe with me, conſidered the treatment I had ſuffered from my huſband as a fortunate cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, as it would probably procure me the pleaſure of accompanying my adored Rookſby abroad. Pardon, madam, theſe involuntary expreſſions of affection, I will ſtrive to reſtrain my pen: but when the heart has once been ſtrongly attached, it is hard to break it of its uſual effuſions of tenderneſs. I bid the ſervant ſhew me to the room where he was, and ruſhing into it, overcome with the various emotions, which agitated my boſom, I fainted in his arms. It will be needleſs to repeat our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I muſt only remark, that as I had
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:029439_0418_0FE117D8410903C0"/>
never informed him of my unfortunate mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with Ramſay, and, as he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuppoſed me the wife of Mr. Millar, I did not dare explain to him the real cauſe of my abrupt appearance at Dover. He at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed it ſolely to my affection to himſelf, and I bleſt the chance which had led me to him.</p>
                     <p>On our return from the continent, I made many enquiries concerning my dear Miſs Howard, for whom I had ſuffered many an anxious hour; but could not by any means learn where you had taken refuge after the inhuman treatment you had experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at Kenſington. I make no doubt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, but you are acquainted with every circumſtance, preceding the time in which I had hoped to be united to Mr. Rookſby. I had previouſly wrote to Mrs. Ramſay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting, ſhe would uſe her intereſt with her ſon to relinquiſh all claim to me as his wife, and indeed, I had been informed I could refute that claim by pleading infancy at the time of my imprudent elopement. To theſe letters I received the moſt ſatisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, ſigned by both Ramſay and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, declaring they were heartily weary of the connection and would gladly renounce it, on condition of my paying a ſtipulated ſum of money, to which I readily agreed, and began
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:029439_0419_0FE117DD8532CF80"/>
to look forward with hope to days of future happineſs, and let me add innocence, for I felt my heart ſo firmly attached to the generous Rookſby, as to render it impoſſible for me ever to injure him even in thought. But, ah! my dear madam, how ſoon were theſe bright proſpects overclouded, how quickly was this charming hope ſnatched from me, and, my boſom left a chearleſs and deſolate chaos, which peace or joy can never more enliven. When I endeavour to retrace this moſt heart rending period of my life: ſuch agonizing feelings overpower me, that my tears flow in ſcalding torrents down my cheeks; and ſighs of acute anguiſh rend my boſom. I cannot at preſent proceed in my recital.—Oh! hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, that one who knows ſo well the juſt value of virtue, ſhould be irreſiſtibly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to actions from which her ſoul ſhrinks with horror. The innocent may pity, but they cannot have the remoteſt idea of my ſufferings.</p>

                     <p>My heart is more at eaſe, tears are a ſweet relief to the unfortunate, and when I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered the words of conſolation which I had
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:029439_0420_0FE117E0659692E8"/>
liſtened to from the lips of angelic purity, when the benevolent Mrs. Rookſby cheared me with her preſence, a ſoothing reflection, ſomething like hope, pervaded my boſom, and though tears ſtill continued to fall, they fell without pain. I will now proceed in my narrative.</p>
                     <p>On the evening preceding the day on which I flattered myſelf with becoming the happieſt of my ſex, I expected Mrs. Ramſay to receive the money which I had promiſed to pay her, and therefore, deſired the ſervants to deny me, even to the choſen maſter of my affections. Unfortunate hour, of what ſcenes of miſery wert thou the harbinger, but I will not complain, I acknowledge I deſerved it all, for had I not deceived the beſt the worhieſt of mankind, by daring to accept his honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able offers, when I knew myſelf already ſacrificed (I will not ſay united) to a villain. But what will not a woman do, who loves, who doats to madneſs and fears to be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted forever from the object of her adoration, what errors will not the heart involuntarily commit when under the influence of hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winked paſſion?—</p>
                     <p>It was about nine o'clock as I was ſitting in the nurſery, with my two dear boys, that a ſervant informed me the perſon whom I
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:029439_0421_0FE117E5EBFDF680"/>
expected was below, I kiſſed my ſweet cherubs bade them good night and repaired to the parlour, which I had appointed to receive Mrs. Ramſay in; but now great was my aſtoniſhment on entering the room to ſee my inexorable tormenter and his ſiſter Eleanor, with their mother. I gave a ſhriek and ſunk trembling on the neareſt chair. Ramſay approached me with feigned tenderneſs—"why theſe alarms, my dear Clara," ſaid he "why ſhould you ſtart thus to behold the man who adores you, and who though you have cruelly deſerted and injured, is ready again to receive you to his arms, and willing to forget all that is paſt."—"would to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven" ſaid I, "that every paſt action of my life could be buried in eternal oblivion, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that to which I was artfully led by you and your inſinuating ſiſter, of giving you my hand, when a moment's reflection would have convinced me you had no ſhare in my heart."—</p>
                     <p>"It is well, madam," ſaid he, "you have made a frank confeſſion but know it is amply in my power to revenge the repeated inſults and injuries I have received from you.—You flatter yourſelf it is in your power to annul a marriage contracted in your minority, but it is not; and unleſs you conſent to make me maſter of all the money and jewels at preſent
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:029439_0422_0FE117E9E45B1930"/>
in your poſſeſſion, and leaving this houſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me wherever I chooſe to go, I will to-morrow follow you to the Church and in the face of the whole congregation expoſe your infamous conduct, and claim my prior right not only to your perſon, but to all the wealth your infatuated lover has heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon you."—What were my ſufferings at this horrid moment. Turn either way, infamy ſtared me in the face. I was unable to determine what plan to purſue. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in London was impoſſible, after what had paſt as I ſhould undoubtedly have been the jeſt even of my own ſervants. At length I concluded, whatever might be my fate, the generous Rookſby ſhould not be involved in the ſhame that would conſequently enſue on a public expoſure of my guilt, I therefore told Ramſay I was ready to accompany him wherever he pleaſed; but as to the preſents I had received from Mr. Rookſby, I did not conceive I had any right to take them with me.—</p>
                     <p>This was not what the wretch wanted. Horrible menaces and threats were uſed to prevail on me to give him my caſh and jewels, I was intirely in the power of theſe three wretches, nor did I dare even to call for the aſſiſtance of my ſervants, as they all declared my life ſhould pay the forfeit of ſuch an
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:029439_0423_0FE117EF0F3F9850"/>
attempt: and when they had gained their point, and I attempted to go up ſtairs to fetch the jewels, both Mrs. Ramſay and Eleanor accompanied me. On returning to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, they deſired me to ſend for a Hackney Coach.—Then it was, dear madam that my innocent infants darted acroſs my memory. "I muſt have my children," ſaid I.—"In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſaid the unfeeling Ramſay, but you will not. The brats are none of mine; leave them then to him who has a right to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them."</p>
                     <p>To deſcribe my anguiſh at this cruel ſpeech is impoſſible.—You, madam, are a mother, and it is only a mother can conceive my ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. I knelt, I bathed his feet with tears, and embraced his knees, but in vain. Too much under the dominion of fear to exert myſelf to inſiſt on their being taken with me, I ſuffered myſelf to be led more dead than alive to the coach; and that very night we all ſer out for Cornwall. What arts they made uſe of to deceive my ſervant, I know not; but before our departure from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my trunks were brought to Mrs. Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay's, and one ſmall one containing every neceſſary for travelling was opened that I might dreſs myſelf in a proper manner for ſo long a journey. I never could learn how they had contrived this, but am rather led
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:029439_0424_0FE117F1E7AFDDC8"/>
to imagine they had bribed my own woman to their intereſt.—During my comfortleſs journey, all my thoughts were occupied by my beloved children, who were left entirely to the humanity of a man, whom I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and injured in the groſſeſt manner, and who might avenge the mother's crimes by deſerting her offspring. I was ſenſible Rookſby poſſeſſed a benevolent heart, but when I remembered the provocations I had given him—I trembled for the fate of my poor infants, whoſe only birth-rights were poverty, ſhame, and the contempt of the world. It is impoſſible for any one, who has not been in the ſame ſituation to judge of my diſtreſs. The anxiety of my mind affected my health, and before we arrived at our journey's end I was in a high fever. We ſtopped at a village near Saltaſh, where my diſorder increaſed to ſuch a degree that it was dangerous to think of removing me. A delirium enſued and I raved (as I have been ſince informed) inceſſantly for Rookſby and my children. At length, youth and a good conſtitution combated the ſtrength of my diſorder; and after a profound ſleep of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hours, I awoke to perfect reaſon; but Gracious Heaven! what were my feelings, to learn when I enquired for Ramſay and Eleanor, that they were gone, and with them all my property. The clergyman of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:029439_0425_0FE117F7B86750D8"/>
a humane ſenſible man had frequently viſited me, during my illneſs, and now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the room with an intent to ſee if I yet lived. It was to him I had been indebted for all the attentions that had been ſhewn me: and when he found me capable of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he put into my hands a letter which he ſaid my brother had left for me. At the word brother I expreſſed ſome aſtoniſhment: but my curioſity and impatience to read the letter would not then permit an explanation. This was the letter</p>

                     <p>Before I had finiſhed this inhuman letter, I fell into ſtrong convulſions, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned a relapſe of my diſorder, and I was again reduced to inſanity.</p>
                     <p>The humane clergyman had me removed to his own houſe, and by the kind atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of himſelf and a daughter, I was in time reſtored to health and a keen ſenſe of my deplorable ſituation.</p>
                     <p>As my ſtrength returned, my afflictions recurred to my mind with greater force—My dear deſerted infants periſhing for want,

or expoſed to the harſh uſage experienced by children left to the pariſh, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly before my eyes, and I reſolved at all events to return to London and learn their fate. Ill as my benevolent hoſt could afford it, he lent me three guineas to help me on my journey, and gave me a letter to a poor woman, a late pariſhioner of his, who was married and ſettled in London, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting her to render me every ſervice in her power. With this ſlender ſum, I ſat forward and after a weariſome journey ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times riding, ſometimes walking, I arrived ſate in town, and took up my abode with the perſon juſt mentioned. From the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires I made (for I had the temerity to venture to Mr. Rookſby's houſe) I learnt his happy marriage with the amiable Miſs Howard, and inwardly rejoiced to think that in ſuch a union, his future happineſs muſt be ſecure. I alſo learnt, that my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were in Devonſhire. The maternal heart will yearn to pour forth its affection. I had determined to walk to the environs of Oak-hall and endeavour to gain a ſight of my beloved little ones, when a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward accident prevented my putting my deſigns in execution. This was my kind landlady falling ill, and as ſhe kept a ſhop, her huſband earneſtly entreated me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with them till her recovery; to which
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:029439_0428_0FE1180559D56B28"/>
as I was under many obligations to them, I could not but aſſent. Her illneſs was pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and lingering, and in the end terminated her life. Soon after her deceaſe, I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed removing from the houſe, when the very man, who had ſo earneſtly entreated my ſtay, now demanded payment for my board and lodging. I had neither money nor friends. What could I do? I thought once of applying to Mr. Rookſby; but the fear of giving you pain prevented me. I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to my hard fate in ſilence and was conveyed to priſon. Three months did I linger in this wretched place, huddled among the moſt abject and miſerable of the human race; and barely exiſting on the ſcanty pittance allowed me, and the charity of the benevolent. At length, I was one day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized by a tradeſman, with whom I had dealt in my days of affluence. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerated my condition, generouſly paid the ſum for which I had been confined, and gave me two guineas in my pocket. No ſooner was I at liberty, than I reſumed my wiſh of going to my children. I ſet forward and almoſt begged my way to this place; but alas! when here, what could I do for ſupport, what door would open to receive a poor wretch like me? I wandered every day round the environs of the hall, and once had the extatic pleaſure of catching a
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:029439_0429_0FE1180A71D28058"/>
glance of my children: but I dared not ſpeak to them, though I longed to fold them to my maternal heart. My little ſtock of money was ſoon exhauſted, though I lived almoſt upon bread and water, and at night, reſted my weary limbs on the damp ground. But conſcience told me it was all right, and only a juſt puniſhment for my errors; ſo I bore it without complaint, and watered my cold pillow with tears of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned repentance. One afternoon, as I was wandering in the adjacent fields, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by hunger and diſtreſs, I ſat down beſide a brook that ran along the woodſide and after reflecting a few moments on the horrors of my ſituation, I conceived the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious idea of putting a period to my exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I aroſe from my ſeat to put my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in execution, when hearing a ruſtling on the other ſide the hedge, I ſtarted; and in a moment ſaw Mr. Rookſby come acroſs a ſtile into the field where I was. I gave a faint ſcream and ſunk to the ground oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by undeſcribable emotions. Urged by humanity, he approached and raiſed me from the earth. I opened my eyes; but dared not look at him.</p>
                     <p>"Poor ſoul," ſaid he, in the accent of benevolence, "you ſeem ill. Where ſhall I lead you, or what can I do to ſerve you."
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:029439_0430_0FE1187BB68E04C8"/>
"Leave me," I replied, with a look and voice of deſtraction—"Leave me Rookſby to the fate I merit."—"Gracious heaven!" ſaid he, "is it poſſible, or do my ſenſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me?"—"Oh!" ſaid I, claſping my hands, "pity the wretched Clara, and leave her to die in peace."</p>
                     <p>"Clara," cried he, ſlackening the arm that had ſupported me, "poor infatuated wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, how came you thus reduced?"—</p>
                     <p>I need not repeat what anſwer I made—ſuffice it to ſay, I ſaw the tear of compaſſion ſparkle in his eye, and heard him declare, I ſhould be permitted to ſee my children.—He gave me relief with a liberal hand, and at parting, deſired I would let him know where to find me, that I might not be again reduced to ſuch miſery.</p>
                     <p>Thus, madam, have I retraced a life of complicated guilt and ſorrow. I am fully ſenſible of the benevolence and candor of your heart, and I truſt my unfeigned peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence joined to my ſufferings will expunge from your memory my faults. Teach me, dear madam, how to convince you of my gratitude for your great condeſcenſion in intereſting yourſelf in the fate of ſo worthleſs a being as I am, and whatever plan your

                     <p>I WAS obliged to ſend away my laſt in ſuch a hurry, I had no time to make the leaſt remark on Clara's letter. I will confeſs the ſtory it contained did not ſtrike me as altogether conſiſtent or probable; but I made great allowances for that ſelf love, which urges us ever to extenuate as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our errors; and endeavour to ſet our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct

in the faireſt point of view. I alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that whatever had been her er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, ſhe was now penitent and in diſtreſs; and muſt, unleſs ſome friend ſtepped forward to ſave her, ſink into an untimely grave. I did not heſitate in reſolving to become that friend, though I determined to keep the whole affair concealed from Mrs. Rookſby and Miſs Sidney, and, indeed, I inwardly wiſhed that Rookſby might not deſire to ſee Clara's confeſſion, as by reading it he muſt diſcover that I had known her before, which would immediately bring on an explanation of her cruel behavior to me, which he would not be very ready to overlook or pardon.—Fortunately he never even expreſſed the ſlighteſt deſire to know what ſhe had ſaid. I told him, ſhe ſhould never want a friend, while I had power to aſſiſt her; and he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perfectly ſatiſfied of the ſincerity of my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion. Accordingly I wrote to her, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her if ſhe would mention any place where ſhe would like to reſide, I would undertake to pay her board and beſides allow ſomething handſome for other neceſſary expences; but recommended to her to fix her reſidence in the country, where there would be fewer allurements to draw her from the laudable reſolutions ſhe had formed of amendment. I received for anſwer, that the fondneſs of a mother impelled her to wiſh her reſidence

                     <p>Laſt night Mr. Belger arrived. I cannot account for it, Celia, but the preſence of this man always diſtreſſes and alarms me. I
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:029439_0434_0FE1181D8765AD40"/>
am never comfortable when he is in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, though it is only for a viſit of a few hours. How I ſhall ſupport his company for ſix weeks or two months, I cannot tell. It is a long time ſince I have mentioned my ſweet Clementina; believe me, were I to give inclination the reins; I ſhould fill a whole ſheet with accounts of the dear little cherub's daily improvement. But, though the theme would be delightful for a fond mother to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate upon, I am ſenſible it would be but inſipid, when offered to the peruſal of one who though intereſted in all my concerns, never felt a mother's tenderneſs, anxiety and ſolicitude.</p>

                     <p>You will be ſurprized, my dear Celia, when I tell you, I am become the lady Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful of all our poor tenants and their families. I walk round every morning or evening; that the weather permits, and adminiſter to the deſeaſes of both body and mind. In the firſt I am aſſiſted by a worthy apothecary, who having a large ſhare of merit, Fortune thought he had ſufficient, and was therefore extremely ſparing of her favours; ſo that the poor man with a great deal of knowledge in his head, much benevolence in his heart, and a large family in his houſe, had but very
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:029439_0435_0FE118216BEBF908"/>
little money in his purſe. I heard of him by accident, and not being extremely well, ſent for him, though his unpowdered wig and thread-bare coat would not have been a recommendation, had I conſulted his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance only; but I chatted with him half an hour ſeveral mornings ſucceſſively, and found his company more efficacious than his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; for I was always better after his viſits, the reaſon of which was, I thought the doctor himſelf ſeemed happier. So one after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, Amelia and I took a ſtroll acroſs the park, and ſpent an hour or two with his wife and her ſix chubby, roſy cheeked chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and at parting, contrived it ſo that at the next viſit the doctor came neither in an unpowdered wig or thread-bare coat; ſince which time he has conſtantly been our eſcorte in our viſits to the ſick. I find money and he finds phyſic, and I do aſſure you we are both very well pleaſed with our ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments. Beſides you cannot think how the doctor is riſing in reputation, ſince his appearance is ſo mended. He is now often ſeen coming out of the doors of the wealthy, which I hope preſages he will one day become wealthy himſelf.</p>

                     <p>I am extremely flurried and vexed, indeed I think my evil genius prevailed, when Rookſby firſt formed an acquaintance with Belger. The man is an unprincipled liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and Amelia was greatly miſtaken, when ſhe imagined any tie however ſacred, would be reſtriction upon his licentious paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.—</p>
                     <p>Rookſby had rode out laſt evening, Amelia was reading to Mrs. Rookſby, and I imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Belger was with my huſband, took a book in my hand and ſtrolled out to indulge a contemplative mood, which at that time prevailed over my mind. I rambled far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than I at firſt intended, and before I was aware of it, the ſhades of night came on.—The evening was remarkably fine, the moon aroſe veiled in a fleecy cloud, which ſerved only to increaſe the glory it could not hide; a gentle zephyr whiſpered through the trees, and I felt a ſenſation of gratitude, wonder and delight pervade my ſoul; whilſt admiring, I beheld the beauty of the ſurrounding ſcene, at the top of a walk at no great diſtance from the houſe, but on a little eminence, there is a ſummer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe greatly admired by all the family for
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:029439_0437_0FE1182A2ADF43F8"/>
the charming view it commands of an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive well cultivated country. In this place I had been working in the morning, and in paſſing it, recollected I had left my work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bag there, in which was ſomething I wanted. I therefore ſtepped in with a deſign of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it away. The moon ſhone through the windows full upon an organ which was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced there for me to entertain myſelf with, and as I am fond of ſolemn muſic, the ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the evening and the ſerenity of every ſurrounding object inſpired me with a wiſh to touch the inſtrument. I therefore ſat down, and following the impulſe of my ſoul, began the following Hymn to Gratitude:</p>

                     <p>I had ſung it over once, and was juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the laſt ſtanza with all the real fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which at that moment warmed my ſoul, when hearing a footſtep, I turned round and ſaw Mr. Belger enter the ſummer houſe.</p>
                     <p>"So you are returned," ſaid I, riſing from my ſeat; "but pray where is Rookſby."</p>
                     <p>"I have not been with him," replied Belger, "nor do I think he is returned. I have been enjoying a far greater pleaſure, than any he can meet with abroad. I have been liſtening to your charming voice, which with ſuch enthuſiaſtic fervour, has been pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the grateful emotions of your ſoul."</p>
                     <p>"I have been here ſome time," ſaid I careleſsly, "and I believe it is getting late.
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:029439_0439_0FE118346EF19FB8"/>
Pray do not let me interrupt your intended ramble; but I am afraid of taking cold ſhould I remain here any longer."</p>
                     <p>"You muſt not go, deareſt, lovelieſt of women, I cannot loſe this only opportunity which I have had of ſpeaking to you without obſervation. Hear me, pity me! From the firſt moment, that I beheld you, my heart has known neither joy nor peace. In every place, in every hour, ſleeping or waking, your image ſtill purſues me. I love, I doat to madneſs and yet have only the hope of exciting your compaſſion."</p>
                     <p>"My contempt ſir, you certainly excite, by this unparalled effrontery. I thought Mr. Belger had received my anſwer on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſome years ſince, and am ſurprized how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he then dared to inſult an unprotected girl, that he ſhould ſuppoſe he might with impunity now repeat thoſe inſults to the wife of his friend."</p>
                     <p>He liſtened not to what I was ſaying, but placing himſelf between me and the door, forcibly ſeized my hands, and was proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the moſt romantic profeſſions of plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic love, when I ſaw Mr. Rookſby coming up the walk. Agitated and diſtreſſed beyond meaſure, I cried "cruel, perſecuting Belger,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:029439_0440_0FE1183986F39250"/>
you have exepoſed me to the ſuſpicions of my huſband, who muſt ſuppoſe a guilty aſſignation has been the cauſe of our being alone here at this late hour." I had no time to ſay more. Mr. Rookſby entered. "why, my dear Meriel" ſaid he, "do you ſtay out thus late expoſing yourſelf to the dews of the evening," then perceiving Belger, he added, "but you have company with you and, perhaps, I intrude on an agreeable <hi>tete-a-tete."</hi> I endeavoured to compoſe my agitated ſpirits, and anſwer him in a ſtyle of raillery; but it was impoſſible. I diſcovered by the manner in which he ſpoke, that the unhappy jealouſy of his temper was awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that it would not be an eaſy matter to convince him, his ſuſpicions were without foundation, I trembled, as I took hold of his arm; and we proceeded in ſilence to the houſe. When we entered, my mother ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly expreſſed her anxiety and fears of my having taken cold, Amelia too gently chid me for playing truant as ſhe called it. I do not know how I looked, but I am ſure I felt very diſagreeably. Indeed, the raillery of Amelia, the cold reſerve of Rookſby, and the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating glances of Belger ſo powerfully affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my feelings; that I pleaded indiſpoſition and retired to my apartment, where I have given vent to my tears, and in ſome meaſure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

uneaſineſs to my friendly Celia. I fear, it will be long before Rookſby will again look on me with tenderneſs; and when I recollect, the manner of my leaving Mrs. Rookſby and Amelia, the length of time I was abſent, and my being found at ſo late an hour in the ſummer houſe with Belger, who no doubt had alſo been rambling about for ſome time, though we had but that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment met. All theſe circumſtances muſt tend to make me appear guilty of impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, if not imprudence. Again and again I repeat it. Belger ſeems doomed to be the bane of my happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Amelia has juſt been with me. I informed her of the cauſe I had for uneaſineſs. She blamed me for retiring ſo early, ſaying it gave me an appearance of conſcious guilt, though ſhe was fully ſenſible that every thought of my heart was purity itſelf; ſhe bade me aſſume an air of cheerfulneſs, as ſhe was afraid that the timid embarraſſment that modeſty and real innocence ever diſcovers, when glanced on by the eye of ſuſpicion, would only tend to encreaſe the doubts Rookſby already harboured. But I hear him coming. I muſt quit my pen and retire to bed, though greatly I fear, not to reſt.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>When Rookſby entered the apartment, a mixture of ſorrow, anger and diſtreſs ſat on his countenance.—"I thought, madam," ſaid he, "you were indiſpoſed, as you retired ſo early; but I ſee you are not in bed yet; but agreeable meditation is certainly more pleaſing, than the company of thoſe we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. Pray do not let me diſturb your reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie."—"You ſpeak in riddles, Mr. Rookſby. Whoſe company did you ſuppoſe I fled from, when I left the parlour. Solitude, indeed, was more agreeable than to be in company, and witneſs the frown of diſpleaſure that ſat on your countenance. It was not the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach impelled me to retire; it was a pain more acute."—I could not proceed, but laying my hand on my boſom, the involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary tear choaked my utterance.</p>
                     <p>"My beloved Meriel, "ſaid he, ſitting down by me, and ſpeaking in a ſoftened accent, "do not weep. Thoſe precious tears would melt a heart of adamant: think then, how much they muſt diſtreſs one who glows with unutterable tenderneſs toward you."</p>
                     <p>"Ah Rookſby, why, if you really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſuch tender emotions in my favour,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:029439_0443_0FE118470B2A90F8"/>
why have you wounded my heart, by utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch unkind, I may ſay, cruel ſuſpicions."</p>
                     <p>"Meriel", ſaid he, looking at me intent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, "did you not confeſs you knew Belger ſome time ſince at Kenſington."</p>
                     <p>"Moſt aſſuredly, I did."</p>
                     <p>"And during the time of your acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance there, did he never expreſs his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration—his eſteem—his love to you."</p>
                     <p>"How can you aſk ſuch a queſtion? He was at that time"—</p>
                     <p>"Married, you would ſay," cried he, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting me, "but I know he was not, and I remember hearing him once ſpeak of a beautiful creature, he knew at that place, who had more power over his heart than all the reſt of the ſex put together."</p>
                     <p>"And therefore, it follows," ſaid I, "that I muſt be the perſon he meant (attempting a ſmile.) My dear Rookſby, if you have ſuch an opinion of your Meriel's attractions, ſhe has a far more humble one of herſelf."</p>
                     <p>"But you had certainly been indulging him, this evening, with a long <hi>tete-a-tee."</hi>
                     </p>

"You are miſtaken, He had not been in the ſummer houſe above three minutes before you joined us."</p>
                     <p>"There is ſuch an ingenuous frankneſs in your manner, dear girl, that it would be almoſt a crime to doubt of your ſincerity. Yet when I reflect"—</p>
                     <p>In ſaying this, he ſtarted up and ſtriking his forehead with his hand, he cried, "theſe doubts will unſettle my reaſon"—I was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and riſing from my ſeat endeavoured to ſooth him. He took my hand and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to his lips, ſaid, "I cannot credit aught to your diſadvantage. Your counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is ſo expreſſive of innocence, that it is impoſſible to believe you otherwiſe. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give my ungenerous conduct. It is the fault of my nature. Forget it, and I will be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful how I offend again." You may be ſure, I was not backward in promiſing a total for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs of this painful event: but I am ſenſible, my dear Celia, it is impoſſible to keep my promiſe, for though we all met this morning in the ſame ſocial manner as uſual I felt ſuch a reſtraint upon myſelf whenever Belger addreſſed me, and anſwered the moſt trifling queſtions with ſuch evident imbaraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that to even an indifferent ſpectator I muſt have appeared ſtrangely agitated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="unknown:029439_0445_0FE1185042A12C08"/>
Indeed, my friend, I began to wiſh I had not concealed from Mr. Rookſby any thing, that paſſed during my reſidence at Kenſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. If I had informed him of Belger's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled behaviour to me at that place he might not have renewed his intimacy, but I always have an objection to relating any tale whereof I am myſelf the heroine, and in this point I avoided it, fearing to incur the imputation of vanity, and in ſo doing, I have incurred that of guilt.—To mention theſe circumſtances now would be impoſſible, as it would only tend to confirm Rookſby's ſuſpicions, perhaps engage him in a quarrel with Belger and by making it a public affair, caſt a blemiſh on my reputation, which no future conduct will ever wipe off. But I think through the whole courſe of my life I have been particularly unfortunate in having my moſt innocent actions miſconſtrued, and though my own boſom conceals not a wiſh which does not tend to the univerſal happineſs of mankind in general. I have never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enemies, who are ever ready to catch at the errors, to which frail mortality is liable; and magnify them into crimes.—I have however a ſweet conſolation Celia. My heart is conſcious of its own integrity and relies on that Power, who knows its innocence to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it through every trial, which in His wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom He may ſee proper to lay upon it. This
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:029439_0446_0FE118561A2B2C48"/>
is a conſolation of which no afflicton, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſevere, can rob me.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Rookſby is I fear, in a declining ſtate of health. Age and its attendant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities bend her frame to the earth; but her mind is ſtill in full vigour. She is the ſame pious, reſigned chearful chriſtian, as ever: and her company is equally ſought by the young as well as by thoſe more nearly of her own years. A journey to the ſouth of France is judged neceſſary for her the enſuing winter. Mr. Rookſby does not wiſh to leave England; ſo I have not hinted my deſire of accompanying her. Indeed, my preſent ſituation would render travelling dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, Amelia goes with her, and I mean to invite Suſan Moſſop to ſpend the winter with me in town, not that I expect to reap much pleaſure from her ſociety; but I think a reſidence in my family may be of ſervice to her; and ſhould any proper match offer, the want of a fortune ſhall not be an obſtacle, Adieu my friend, your's ever.</p>

                     <p>SURELY, ſurely, my friend, I was born to be the ſport of fortune; for truly can I ſay with the Poet,
<q>
                           <l>That e'er the cup of joy could reach my lips,</l>

Yes, my beloved friend, the ſweet enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcenes of happineſs now fade upon my ſight, and like the deluſive viſion of a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered imagination, ſerves only to make the ſurrounding deſolate proſpect, the more dark and gloomy.</p>
                     <p>From the time of my laſt letter, Mrs. Rookſby's health has evidently become worſe and worſe every day; ſo that we were obliged to haſten her departure for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, as the phyſicians feared the cold au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal blaſts would be too much for her enervated frame to bear. We were buſy in preparing for her departure, when one even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt as the ſun was ſet, a little girl came and informed me a poor tenant of our's was taken ſuddenly ill, and wiſhed very much to ſee me.—As Amelia was buſy in her own apartment, I would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt her to requeſt her company; but taking ſome cordials with me and bidding Thomas follow, I took hold of the little girl and bid her lead me to the cottage. When I arrived the poor woman told me ſhe had been ſeized with a ſudden fit, and imagining herſelf dying—ſhe had ſent for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend her children to my care; but as ſhe now found herſelf much better, ſhe hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hoped I would pardon the trouble ſhe had given me. As I had walked very quick, I
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:029439_0449_0FE1186261369428"/>
found myſelf ſomewhat fatigued and ſat down for a few moments to reſt. Whilſt I ſat, I buſied myſelf in making enquiries concerning the poor woman's family, and learnt that ſhe had ſeven children and a very bad huſband.—"I have been in a deal of trouble, madam," ſaid ſhe, "Robin has been very idle this ſummer and had gotten himſelf in debt; but we were relieved from our neceſſities by a gentleman, who is I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, at the Hall; for the children ſay they have ſeen him there. Oh! madam, he has been the preſerver of me and mine, and I am bound to pray for his proſperity." She was eagerly proceeding, when caſting my eye toward the window, I ſaw Belger open the wicket, which ſerved for a gate, and come in.—"Here is your benefactor coming good woman" ſaid I, and ſlipping two gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas into her hand, went toward the door, but was not quick enough to eſcape, before Belger entered.—"Bleſs me my fair hoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs," ſaid he, in an accent of ſurpriſe; "who could have thought of ſeeing you here; not that it is ſurpriſing to ſee Mrs. Rookſby in the cottage of poverty ſweetly alleviating its attendant evils, but the lateneſs of the hour and to ſee her without Miſs Sidney."</p>
                     <p>"Amelia was engaged," ſaid I endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to paſs him, "and indeed, I did not obſerve how late it was."—</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="120" facs="unknown:029439_0450_0FE118682D419240"/>
"You will permit me to ſee you home?'</p>
                     <p>"By no means Mr. Belger. I have my ſervant with me."</p>
                     <p>"Do not, deareſt madam, deny me the felicity of walking by your ſide and enjoying a few moments uninterrupted converſation, a bleſſing I cannot obtain at the hall."</p>
                     <p>"Nor can I think, ſir, you have any thing to ſay to me, to which the whole world might not be a witneſs, I deſire you will ſuffer me to go home alone. I have particular reaſons."</p>
                     <p>"I know your reaſons, moſt lovely, moſt injured of women. Rookſby is jealous, weary of the poſſeſſion of the moſt ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treaſure, he ſeeks by accuſing your ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs purity to excuſe his own errors."—</p>
                     <p>"Stop, Belger, I will liſten no longer, Rookſby is too juſt to ſuſpect the integrity of a heart, with whoſe very emotion he is acquainted. As to errors I neither ſuſpect him capable of any; derogatory to his own honour or prejudicial to our mutual happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and know, ſir, the perſon who would endeavour to awaken ſuſpicion in my boſom, will be ever held as an object of contempt and deteſtation."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="121" facs="unknown:029439_0451_0FE1186BA4CF2C08"/>
I then darted at him a look expreſſive of my honeſt indignation, and endeavoured to quit the houſe: but he threw himſelf on his knees before me, and forcibly taking my hand earneſtly requeſted to be heard for only one moment. From the inſtant Belger firſt entered, the woman had from a motive of reſpect left the room, and my ſervant was without ſide the gate, waiting for my coming out.</p>
                     <p>I was heſitating for an anſwer, by which I might hope to make him relinquiſh his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; when I heard my huſband's voice en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of the ſervant, "whom he was waiting for?"</p>
                     <p>"My miſtreſs, ſir," replied the man.</p>
                     <p>"Your miſtreſs is here then—and who is with her?"</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Belger went in a few moments ſince."</p>
                     <p>"Damnation!" exclaimed he, and puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the man with violence inſtantly ruſhed into the houſe. How I looked, or what I ſaid, I cannot pretend to determine, but of this I am certain my feelings were unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="122" facs="unknown:029439_0452_0FE118714CDD3680"/>
"It is well, madam," ſaid he, "I have at length diſcovered the true cauſe of your frequent rambles toward this cottage, and by heavens."—Rage choaked him, I ſummoned all my reſolution and endeavoured to calm his agitated ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>"Frequent rambles, Mr. Rookſby, I do not underſtand you; I never was at this cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage before, nor ſhould have come now had I not been ſent for."</p>
                     <p>"I know you were ſent for. That is the very thing that drives me to madneſs. Oh! Meriel, to think on the very laſt evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my mother and Miſs Sidney leaves Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, you could quit them and taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of my abſence fly on the wings of love to meet your abandoned ſeducer. But, this is no time for argument; tell me, thou vile reptile, who under the maſk of friendſhip haſt diſhonoured me, what reparation can you make for the peace you have deſtroyed, for the purity you have ſullied?—</p>
                     <p>"Dear Rookſby," (ſaid Belger in a tone of diſſembling gentleneſs,) "you are carried away by a wild ungovernable paſſion, I give you my honour I had not been in the houſe ten minutes when you entered; nor had I the moſt diſtant idea of meeting Mrs. Rookſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:029439_0453_0FE1187607CEBFB0"/>
here, you injure her by theſe unjuſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, and what ought to be at this time a material conſideration, you agitate her ſpirits, impair her health and endanger her valuable life."—</p>
                     <p>"Belger" ſaid my huſband, with a voice that made me tremble, "you are both a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard and a villain."</p>
                     <p>"You cannot mean what you ſay."</p>
                     <p>"I do," reiterated Rookſby, fiercely.</p>
                     <p>"Then, ſir, to-morrow between five and ſix o'clock, I ſhall expect to ſee you in a proper place to ſettle this difference. But remember Rookſby, I warn you of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe that will ſeize you, when you diſcover how injuriouſly you have treated both your wife and friend.</p>
                     <p>"Belger," ſaid I exerting all the firmneſs I was miſtreſs of, and laying my hand on his arm, as I ſpoke.—"If you are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to the voice of humanity, explain this horrid myſtery, for I am certain the accidents of this night have been concerted to ruin me in the opinion of my huſband. You call yourſelf his friend. How well you deſerve that title your own conſcience can beſt inform
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:029439_0454_0FE1084A842ECD00"/>
you, that and the all-ſeeing eye of a juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence knows my innocence, and I truſt, it will hereafter, be made appear clear as the noon day ſun. In the mean time, dare not as you value your eternal welfare, to lift your impious hand againſt the life of Rookſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; or, by throwing yourſelf in the way of danger, run the hazard of ruſhing unprepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the preſence of your offended Maker, for let honour give it what falſe gloſs it will, the man, who wantonly throws away his life is as much guilty of ſuicide, as the wretch who ends his exiſtence with a loaded piſtol. And in the caſe of duelling vanquiſh or be vanquiſhed, you are equally a murderer. Go, leave us, would to heaven, I could ſay to that peace which was uninterrupted, till your arrival here.—Return to London, or go any where, ſo as I may not have the weight of bloodſhed to drag my almoſt broken ſpirit to the earth.</p>
                     <p>Rookſby ſtarted up with fury and ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my hand from off Belger's arm, cried—"by heavens you tremble only for him. So as he is ſafe you care not what becomes of me. But come, madam, let us return, it is almoſt dark." As he ſaid this, he pulled me rudely from my ſeat. I attempted to walk; but terror had unnerved my limbs. I ſunk down again on the chair, and had
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:029439_0455_0FE1188194248E20"/>
not a flood of tears relieved me, I muſt have fainted. He was alarmed and called the woman to bring ſome water, and ſaying he would ſend the carriage to fetch me as I was unable to walk,—he went out, followed by Belger in ſullen ſilence. When he was gone, my agitation became ſo great, it threw me almoſt into hyſterics. I was not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently miſtreſs of my recollection to aſk the woman any queſtions, but gave vent to my overcharged heart in a torrent of unreſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed affliction, and when the carriage arrived, threw myſelf into it almaſt diſtracted with the violence of my emotions, where, to my great comfort, I found my kind ſoothing friend Amelia. I related to her what had juſt happened; ſhe comforted me all that lay in her power, and told me Belger had retired to his apartment immediately on entering the houſe, and that Rookſby went to the library, where he was buſy writing. She ſaid ſhe would endeavour to ſee the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer before ſhe went to reſt, and perſuade him to ſet off for London, entreated me to hide my uneaſineſs from Mrs. Rookſby, as her weak ſtate of health would but ill ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the ſhock of ſuch intelligence, when ſhe ſuppoſed us the happieſt of the hymenial votaries, and lamented her being obliged to leave me in ſo diſagreeable a ſituation.</p>

                        <pb n="126" facs="unknown:029439_0456_0FE1188717FBB1B8"/>
I thanked the dear friendly girl; but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her not to be uneaſy; ſaid ſhe could not perform to me a more acceptable ſervice than by attending to the welfare of my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, promiſed to be guided by her advice and bear my afflictions with patience.</p>
                     <p>And ſo I will, my dear Celia; for have I not conſcious innocence for my ſupport, and is it not my duty to ſubmit without repining, to the will of Him, who never lays on his creatures the rod of affliction but for ſome wiſe purpoſe. He can humble the frail body to the duſt the more to exalt the ſoul. He can cauſe the bones that he has broken to rejoice, and heal the broken heart. I feel his mercies at this moment abound in the comforts of an approving conſcience. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his judgments juſt, and pray only for meekneſs and reſignation to bear his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations as I ought.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE been extremely ill ſince I laſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed my dear Celia, occaſioned by the violent agitation my ſpirits had undergone. The morning after the diſagreeable rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mentioned in my laſt, I found myſelf much indiſpoſed; but as it was the day intended for Mrs. Rookſby's departure, I aroſe at the uſual time and endeavoured to appear as chearful as poſſible, that the dear old lady might not perceive the diſtreſs of my mind. Rookſby ſeemed inſpired with the ſame wiſh and though he had not ſpoken to me during the whole night, yet at breakfaſt aſſumed his uſual tenderneſs of manner. It was with infinite pleaſure I learnt that Belger had ſet out for town long before any of the family were ſtirring, leaving only a card to my mother pleading urgent buſineſs as his excuſe for ſo precipitate a departure, and wiſhing her intended journey might have the deſired
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:029439_0458_0FE1188FE26C4180"/>
effect and reſtore her to perfect health. At twelve o'clock the chariot drew up to the door—I felt my ſpirits ſink. I looked firſt at my dear Amelia, then at my mother, and taking a hand from each, preſſed them to my heart and burſt into tears. It was in vain any longer to hide my ſorrows—I ſaw theſe invaluable friends departing from me at the very moment when I moſt wanted their ſoothing attentions. I looked on my gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous benefactreſs, perhaps, for the laſt time. Her wan cheek and emaciated frame, too plainly announced her approaching diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>I threw my arms round her—I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to articulate an adieu—but words were denied me.—"God bleſs you my dear child," ſaid ſhe. "Clement, be tender of her—comfort her—ſtudy her felicity—and may Heaven ſhower its choiceſt bleſſings on you both." She then took up my little Clementina, and letting fall a tear as ſhe preſſed the ſmiling Cherub to her boſom, cried emphatically, "Oh thou ſweet angel! Heaven grant that you may live to be an honour to your father and a bleſſing to your mother—mayeſt thou be endowed with all her virtues without any of his faults." She then once more embraced me and went to the carriage. Amelia ſtayed behind a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:029439_0459_0FE118948385FE28"/>
to comfort and re-aſſure me. She bid me keep up my ſpirits and truſt in that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for ſupport, who never yet forſook the innocent.</p>
                     <p>Rookſby accompanied them ſome miles on horſe back. I followed the chariot with my eyes as long as I could, and then retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my chamber, threw myſelf on the bed, and gave a looſe to unutterable ſorrow. However the ſpirit may be afflicted, nature exhauſted by various conflicts will inſenſibly ſink under the balmy influence of ſleep.—This was my caſe: I ſlept about two hours, but awoke unrefreſhed, and in acute pain. My head ached, my tongue was parched, and I had every ſymptom of an approaching fever. However I endeavoured to riſe and dreſs, to be ready to receive Rookſby, as he propoſed returning to dinner: but to this taſk I was unequal. My head was giddy and my limbs trembled. Heſter, my woman, was alarmed. She rang for the houſe-maid, who juſt came in time to help to ſupport me; for in attempting to go from my bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber to the dreſſing-room, I had fainted. On recovering, I found much worſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences were to be apprehended, than I had at firſt imagined. I ſent immediately for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical aſſiſtance and about four o'clock the next morning, I was delivered of a dead
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:029439_0460_0FE11899F69C1658"/>
child. For ſome hours I was totally inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and for more than a week my life was deſpaired of. Rookſby was frequent in his enquiries after my health; but I could plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive, he thought more of the loſs of his ſon than my evidently dangerous ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. However it pleaſed Heaven to reſtore me, though by ſlow degrees, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the phyſicians pronounced me able to bear the fatigue of travelling, I ſet off for London, vainly hoping that variety of ſcenes, company and public amuſements would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore in ſome meaſure my loſt chearfulneſs; at leaſt I thought it would baniſh thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding reflections which gnawed and goaded my poor lacerated heart. Oh! my beloved Celia, Rookſby no longer retains the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of affection for me. In company he is polite, but diſtant; when by ourſelves (which is indeed but ſeldom) he is cold, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and my Celia will hardly believe it, he once on my gently remonſtrating on this painful change, ſtruck me, nay curſed me, and called me by a name, my ſoul ſhudders to think on. That he hates and deſpiſes the woman he once doated on is now become too evident to be doubted; for he has never returned to my apartment ſince my illneſs, but occupies one in another part of the houſe. Suſan Moſſop is with me. She is poſſeſſed of more tenderneſs and goodneſs of heart
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:029439_0461_0FE1189F0D092498"/>
than I at firſt ſuſpected. She labours inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly to amuſe me, and though I cannot partake of her chearfulneſs, I am grateful for her attention. Heſter is married to a man of genteel fortune, but from what I can judge of the character of both, I think they will paſs that kind of inſipid life ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Prior in his epitaph on ſauntering Jack and idle Joan.</p>
                     <l>Nor wiſhed, nor cared, nor laughed nor cried,</l>
                     <l>And ſo they lived, and ſo they died.</l>
                     <p>I am juſt returned from an airing in Hyde Park, and have been greatly aſtoniſhed to ſee Clara there, whom I left in Devonſhire. She was on horſe-back, elegantly mounted and attended by a ſervant in livery. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed idea ran through my mind, when I firſt ſaw her, yet ſurely ſhe can never add ingratitude to infamy, by ſeducing the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the huſband, when ſhe has been reſcued from want and miſery by the wife, yet, what can have brought her to town, or how is it poſſible ſhe can afford to appear in the manner juſt deſcribed.—</p>
                     <p>I am ſatiſfied Rookſby muſt ſtill hold ſome intercourſe with Clara. We have juſt had a <hi>tete-a-tete</hi> in which he accuſed me of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him, of giving him my hand when
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:029439_0462_0FE118A428491C40"/>
my heart was devoted to another; and of having been long acquainted with Belger, with whom it was well known, I had an illicit intercourſe. Deareſt Celia, imagine the agonizing feelings of my heart on being ſubject to ſuch unjuſt, ſuch cruel ſuſpicions. It was in vain I attempted to aſſert my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; he was well informed, he ſaid, of every incident that had paſſed during my reſidence at Kenſington; that I had been the intimate acquaintance of women of light characters; that my own conduct in regard to Belger was notoriouſly infamous, and that I was in reality the exact reverſe of what I had ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly appeared to his mother, or ſhe never would ſo ſtrenuouſly have preſſed our union. Oh! my friend, would to heaven, I had truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the dictates of my own judgment, had been guided by the impulſe of my heart which ſtrongly urged me to reject this man; but compaſſion, gratitude, and the combined wiſhes of thoſe whom I moſt loved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, operated ſo powerfully on my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that I was unable to withſtand their ſolicitations; and Heaven be my witneſs, I have not in one inſtance ſince I have been united to Rookſby infringed the ſmalleſt duty incumbent on the ſacred character of wife. A letter—it is from Amelia, Heaven grant no ill news.—Read it Celia, I incloſe it for your peruſal, and wonder not that
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:029439_0463_0FE118A91AC22C88"/>
my faſt falling tears oblige me to bid you adieu!—</p>

                     <p>IT is with infinite regret, I take up my pen to inform my dear friend, that the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering appearance of Mrs. Rookſby's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning health, which had ſo elated my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are entirely vaniſhed, and an encreaſing debility of frame, baffles all the ſkill of the phyſicians and alarms us to an imminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. My mind is in ſuch a ſtate of painful anxiety, that I hardly know what I write. When I am preſent with the dear invalid, I endeavour to command my feelings and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

chearful, but the effort is vain, and when I contemplate her pale, yet placid countenance, the tears will involuntarily burſt from my eyes. She, this morning, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving my emotions, called me to the bedſide, (from which ſhe is now ſcarcely able to riſe, even while it is making) and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my hand, "my dear Miſs Sidney," ſaid ſhe, "do not let my approaching diſſolution give you pain.—I ſee it draw near with no other apprehenſion than what frail mortality muſt feel, when called from a temporal to an eternal ſtate, into the immediate preſence of the Creator of the Univerſe!—I have had my ſpan lengthened out far beyond what I had ever expected.—I feel no regret at leaving this tranſitory life;—for my only care was centered in the happineſs of my ſon, and him I ſhall leave happy in the affection of the beſt, the worthieſt of her ſex. I know my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Meriel will feel my loſs: But time will mitigate her affliction and ſhe will bear it with the fortitude of a chriſtian. I have one thing to mention, which nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns your happineſs. I have a nephew here whom you have ſeen—Captain Onſlow is a man every way worthy the eſteem of a woman of ſenſe. He is not inſenſible to the merit of Miſs Sidney, and has requeſted me to plead his cauſe. I flatter myſelf you will not refuſe his ſuit."—She pauſed. I was
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:029439_0465_0FE118B3A08053E8"/>
ſilent. I had frequently ſeen and admired Captain Onſlow: he is in the Eaſt-India ſervice; for though a man of fortune, he prefers a life of activity to one of ſupine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence. An indifferent ſtate of health, brought him to Aix-la-Chapelle; but being now perfectly recovered, he propoſed rejoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his regiment, which it is expected will be ordered to Bengal the enſuing ſeaſon. I ſhould not be thus particular, but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſome diſagreement between Mr. Rookſby and the Captain, you were totally ignorant that you had ſuch a relation, and therefore might wiſh ſome information. I had without vanity reaſon to ſuſpect the Captain's partiality; nor can I with truth aſſert, that my boſom felt that indifference toward him, which it had ever maintained toward the reſt of his ſex. Yet Mrs. Rookſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by taking me at a moment ſo unprepared, I heſitated, and knew not what to anſwer. She ſaw my confuſion and then continued, "I have in my will left you a ſmall token of my regard, which if you liſten to Onſlow's ſuit, I ſhall inſiſt on ſeeing ſettled on your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if it is not painful, my dear Amelia, I could wiſh to hear your candid ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on this ſubject, and it would give me infinite ſatisfaction of ſee you united to ſo worthy a man before I breathe my laſt; as the welfare of every one dear to my charming
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:029439_0466_0FE118B8F7E2CEF8"/>
daughter-in-law muſt ever intereſt my fondeſt ſolicitude," I thanked the generous woman in terms of heartfelt gratitude, aſſured her I was perfectly happy in my preſent ſituation, but that if it was my fate to change, I knew of no perſon I ſhould prefer to Captain On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlow. My only objection would be the difference ſubſiſting between him and Mr. Rookſby, as I feared it would prevent that ſocial intercourſe that I muſt ever wiſh to continue uninterrupted between Mrs. Rookſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by and myſelf. "I will obviate that objection my dear," ſaid ſhe, "for it ſhall be my laſt requeſt to Clement that all animoſity be laid aſide, as he values my bleſſing. And now," continued ſhe, with a faint ſmile, "there remains nothing to be done but for you to take your pen and bid my ſon and his amiable wife to your nuptials. The jaunt will be of ſervice to Meriel after her late illneſs, and ſhe will have the double plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſeeing her beloved friend enter into an honourable and happy marriage, and me into a ſtate of everlaſting bliſs; and tell her from me ſhe ſhould celebrate the two events as equally joyful." "Oh! my dear madam, ſaid I," in an agony of grief, "do not talk thus, I hope you will recover."—</p>
                     <p>"Impoſſible," ſaid ſhe, waving her hand with a ſolemn yet benignant look, "I have
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:029439_0467_0FE118BDDB3C36B8"/>
enquired of the phyſicians how long they ſuppoſe I can remain. They informed me, yeſterday, I may poſſibly continue three weeks or a month longer; but that is the utmoſt; therefore my dear Amelia, loſe no time. I could wiſh to ſee my dear children once more, and I am certain the bare men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that wiſh will be ſufficient to bring them eagerly to me."</p>
                     <p>Thus, my dear Meriel, have I executed the deſire of my almoſt expiring benefactreſs; haſten to me my friend that we may pour our affliction into each others boſom, and by participation lighten the burthen that will preſs ſo heavy on our hearts. I flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the death-bed of an amiable and reſpected parent will have a good effect on the mind of your unkind truant, and bring him back to a ſenſe of the happineſs he is wantonly trifling away. I truſt you will uſe all poſſible expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I have agreable to Mrs. Rookſby's deſire wrote to her ſon requeſting his immediate acquieſcence with her wiſh. Oh! my dear Meriel, my mind is ſorely oppreſſed.

                     <p>From this great theatre of diſſipation and folly does Meriel once more addreſs her friend—but why am I not permitted to ſee you? why in the ſame kingdom does indiſpenſible duties keep me from flying to you, and in your peaceful cloiſter burying myſelf at once from the world and all its ſorrows? Alas I too plainly feel that even there I could not now be at peace: for thither ſhould I carry corroding thought, the pangs of diſappointed love, the remembrance of abuſed confidence, ingratitude and ill requited friendſhip.—Strange ſcenes have paſſed, my friend, ſince I wrote you laſt; I have hovered on the brink of eternity, from whence I was only ſnatched to be the victim of future miſery; but let me purſue ſome method in my narrative and carry you back to the time when the receipt of Amelia's letter hurried us to proceed as expeditiouſly as poſſible to Aix to catch

the parting ſigh and receive the dying bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of my laſt dear parent, my more than mother. Every preparation neceſſary for our departure was ſoon made, when the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing previous to the day on which we were to ſet out, Rookſby came into my dreſſing room, where I was buſy in making ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary arrangements with the houſekeeper, and bidding her quit the room ſat down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide me, and looking with more complacency than he had lately done, when addreſſing me, ſaid, "I have unknown to you Meriel made a little addition to our party to the continent, and flatter myſelf it will not be diſagreeable."—I believe I looked ſurprized when I replied, "had our journey been one of pleaſure I could certainly have no objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any perſon, whom he ſhould think proper to join us, but on ſo mournful an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion I muſt ſuppoſe the preſence of a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger"—</p>
                     <p>"It is not a ſtranger," ſaid he (interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me eagerly,) "it is poor Clara."</p>
                     <p>"Clara, ſir?" in a tone of angry ſurprize.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, my dear," he anſwered heſitatingly, "She is in a bad ſtate of health; I met her lately by accident. She cannot well afford ſo long a journey; and it is a good opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="140" facs="unknown:029439_0470_0FE118CD767F08D8"/>
"Rookſby ſaid I," fixing my eyes upon his face: I think you know me well enough to be certain that if Clara is really ill and in want, ſhe has a claim to every tender office of humanity from me as a fellow-creature, but"—</p>
                     <p>"Nay, Meriel, no buts: ſurely (affecting a ſmile) "you are not jealous?"—"No, ſir, you may reſt quite eaſy on that head. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think ſo meanly of you as to ſuppoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what had paſſed you would again be the dupe of an artful woman; for however my compaſſion may have been awakened toward Clara, I cannot help thinking her a woman capable of the baſeſt duplicity."</p>
                     <p>"She is going to be married to Belger," ſaid he, endeavoring to hide his evident em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment under the maſk of careleſſneſs.</p>
                     <p>"But I hope, ſir, he is not to join us!" ſaid I, reddening with indignation at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of paſt injuries, which I could now trace to their right ſource.</p>
                     <p>"No, he will follow Clara to Aix, and if my mother dies, we ſhall all ſpend the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Paris."</p>
                     <p>The evident compoſure with which he mentioned ſuch an afflicting circumſtance,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:029439_0471_0FE118D0D68C3780"/>
out me to the ſoul.—"You ſpeak of your mother with great indifference," ſaid I, and the tears guſhed from my eyes.</p>
                     <p>"Indifference, no, indeed I am extremely ſorry; but you know, my dear, ſhe is an old woman, and we muſt expect it, and that you know prepares us for the ſtroke, and prevents the ſhock we ſhould otherwiſe feel. I have been thinking," continued he after a little pauſe, "that I ſhall have the Hall pulled down next ſummer and built in a more modern ſtile."</p>
                     <p>I turned from him with ſilent contempt and reſting my cheek upon my hand gave a looſe to melancholy reflections. Celia I have been deceived in this man. He has no heart, no ſenſibility; every feeling of his ſoul is abſorbed in ſelf. Why, why was my fate united to ſuch a man. I was rouſed from my reverſe by a loud knock at the door.—"That is Clara," ſaid he, ſtarting up. "I deſired ſhe would ſleep here, that we might be ready to ſet off together in the morning." I felt a faint chillneſs ſeize me as he ſpoke. I believe my voice faultered as I ſaid, go down then and receive her; I will juſt take one more look at my dear little girl and join you immediately." When he had left the room I ſunk motionleſs on the ſopha. "Good heaven," ſaid I, "and is it come to this. Can
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:029439_0472_0FE118D6624CF5C8"/>
it be poſſible, that the man whom I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to love and honour ſhould thus forget what is due to me, to his child and to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? But I will not judge too raſhly, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued I, riſing and drying my eyes. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they may not be guilty. Jealouſy magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies every object, and conſtrues even laudable actions into crimes." I then viſited the nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and having paſſed a few minutes in careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my little Clementina, I deſcended to the drawing room where I found Clara negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeated on a ſopha by Rookſby, and Suſan Moſſop playing on the Piano Forte. Clara roſe from her ſeat, coloured and heſitatingly ſaid ſomething about intruſion. I confeſs I was not leſs embarraſſed myſelf; however I paid her the civilities neceſſary as being my gueſt and we immediately went to ſupper, ſoon after which I retired on pretence of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome further preparations, and having given orders about an apartment for Clara, I ſat down and wrote a few lines to Suſan re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting, as ſhe intended ſtaying in town, till ſhe heared from us the reſult of our voyage and whether we returned or paſt the winter on the continent, that ſhe would be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly attentive to the child, and in caſe of her father's ſending for her begged ſhe would accompany her to Paris. This I did by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being ſenſible I ſhould have no time to ſpeak to her in the morning; and I did not
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:029439_0473_0FE118DB1498EB30"/>
think proper to ſend for her up ſtairs at that time. Early in the morning our poſt coach was at the door, and by ſix o'clock Mr. Rookſby, Clara, myſelf and Leſter my wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man were ſeated in it; and we proceeded with all imaginable ſpeed to Dover. Rookſby immediately on our arrival ſent to ſpeak to the maſter of a Packet. We found it was impoſſible to think of embarking till the next morning, and were informed by the man that a gentleman and lady juſt arrived from town had taken their paſſage on board his veſſel. While we continued talking, a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle tap at the door interrupted us, and on its being opened who ſhould enter but Mrs. Kingly. It was a moſt agreeable ſurprize to me, though I believe not ſo to Rookſby. "Well met my dear couſin," ſaid ſhe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately ſaluting me, "it is fortunate that we ſhould both be travelling the ſame way. I ſaw your livery in the yard and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately made my enquiries." Kingly is gone out, ſo you ſee I took the opportunity and eloped to you; but when he returns I am ſure he will be as happy as myſelf to pay you his reſpects." While ſhe was ſpeaking ſhe did not notice who was in the room, and, indeed, Clara ſat in an obſcure corner by the fire, but as ſhe finiſhed the laſt ſentence, turning haſtily round ſhe ſaw her; but not recognizing her immediately cried, "I fear
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:029439_0474_0FE118E0463A2978"/>
I am guilty of rudeneſs, you have company."—"No one particular," ſaid I. It is only Mrs. Moreton." Clara was now under the neceſſity of riſing; Mrs. Kingly ſtarted and curtſying formally, while ſhe gave Rookſby a moſt expreſſive look, ſaid ſhe could not have expected to ſee Mrs. Moreton in this party, not knowing we were acquainted. I really felt for Clara; her colour varied from red to pale and from pale to red, till I thought ſhe would have ſunk. Rookſby looked mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and I only ſlightly ſaid, that Mrs. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton having but indifferent health wiſhed to try the air and weather of Aix, and we having an empty ſeat in the coach I had offered it to her.—Mrs. Kingly looked inquiſitive, as much as to ſay, "do you know who ſhe is." But ſhe repreſſed the impulſe of curioſity and made enquiries after my dear mother, whom ſhe did not know till then, was in ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a ſtate.</p>
                     <p>In about an hour Kingly came in, when after the firſt ſalutations were paſt, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to recognize Clara, I think it would be impoſſible to give you an adequate idea of the anger and contempt that agitated his expreſſive countenance, her preſence was a reſtraint upon us all, it checked conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, we were for ſome moments ſilent and embarraſſed—ſhe ſaw it and gueſſing the
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:029439_0475_0FE118E604263D98"/>
cauſe, complained of weakneſs and fatigue and ringing for a light retired to her chamber.</p>
                     <p>She was no ſooner gone than Kingly cried "why Mrs. Rookſby, how long have you been acquainted with that woman."</p>
                     <p>"Some time," I replied affecting as much eaſe as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>"Had you any knowledge of her before you were married?"</p>
                     <p>"O yes, I knew her very well; come I know what you would ſay, but I ſhall ſtop you at once; her former errors are nothing to me; at preſent ſhe is in diſtreſs. It was in my power to render her a trifling ſervice, and I only followed the dictates of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity."</p>
                     <p>"Neglecting thoſe of common prudence," interrupted he tartly.</p>
                     <p>"Pſhaw! nonſenſe," I replied laughing, "do not let us talk any more about her."</p>
                     <p>"You are the moſt unaccountable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man," ſaid he, "that ever exiſted, I declare
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:029439_0476_0FE118EB1B215FA0"/>
if almoſt half your life is not an inexplicable riddle."</p>
                     <p>"My dear," ſaid Mrs. Kingly, to turn the converſation, "my couſins have taken their paſſage in the ſame packet with us; ſo we ſhall croſs the channel together." This had the deſired effect; we inſenſibly fell into mutual enquiries concerning the motives of our intended voyage: the converſation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came by degrees cheerful, and Clara was for the moment forgot. I found that Mr. and Mrs. Kingly were merely on a jaunt of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and that we ſhould have their company no farther than Calais, as they intended to proceed to Bruſſels. But, my dear Celia, vain are the appointments of man; we look forward to many coming years, we mark out plans of future pleaſure and enjoyment: and cry, Thus we will do, and thus. When ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly the unexpected blaſts of adverſity paſs over us, the beauteous viſion fades before our ſight, while darkneſs clouds and tempeſt ſhut the expected joys forever from our view, and hurl them far beyond our reach.</p>
                     <p>Like ſome poor hind, who during the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of the day, had looked often wiſhfully toward a diſtant ſhady grove, where he might repoſe from the ſcorching noon-day ſun.—"When my daily taſk is ended," ſays he,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:029439_0477_0FE118EE0F2B1268"/>
"I will retire there, and as I reſt my weary limbs, enjoy the cool refreſhing breezes as they paſs over the banks of flowers." Theſe reflections ſweeten his toil, and he taſtes a thouſand times by anticipation the pleaſures he expects to enjoy. At length the hour arrives, he quits his labour and haſtily flies to the ſcene of fancy, promiſed bliſs. "How delightful is the cooling ſhade," he cries, as he draws near the grove; "how charming the gurgling of the clear ſtream that glides over the pebbles and falls into a baſon formed by nature; how delicious the fruit that hangs from the trees and courts the hand to gather them. Oh! I could live and die in ſo ſweet a place. How happy I ſhall be, when I reach it, and ſtretch my weary limbs on the ſoft graſſy turf."—Alas! poor ſwain, doſt thou not ſee the ſun is ſunk beneath the hills, the gloom of evening comes on apace, and e'er thou canſt reach thy deſired haven, the clouds of night will obſcure its beauties from thy view, and the chilly dews prevent your tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the repoſe you ſo ardently wiſh fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>WE paſſed the night as propoſed at Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and at an early hour were called to go on board the packet, the wind and tide both favouring us. We embarked before it was well light, and the wind freſhening as we proceeded we were ſoon obliged to retire to our cabins, being ſeized with the ſickneſs incident to thoſe, who are unuſed to the boiſterous element.—For ſome time we were too ill to pay much attention to the motion of the veſſel, but at length I thought it was very violent, and enquired of Kingly, if it was uſual to be ſo much toſſed about in croſſing the channel; his reply alarmed me; "the wind is changed," ſaid he, "and the clouds threathen a boiſterous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

think you will reach Calais to-day, at leaſt not till late in the evening."</p>
                     <p>Soon after this the wind increaſed to a tremendous degree, and I ſaw by Kingly's countenance that he was uneaſy. He went frequently upon deck; then returned to the cabin, endeavoured to chear us, and ſaid he had adviſed the Maſter to turn back as the wind was ſo much againſt us, and we ſhould not feel the ſurges ſo much, when we went before it. Happy would it have been for us all, if this advice had been taken while day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light remained; but the man was obſtinate, and continued beating about till nearly the cloſe of day; then finding it impoſſible to make his intended port, attempted to return to Dover. As night came on, the ſtorm increaſed, and though ſo late in the ſeaſon was attended with the moſt vivid lightning and heavy claps of thunder; the ſea was unuſually agitated, the wind varying almoſt every inſtant and reſting at no ſettled point. It is impoſſible, my dear Celia, to give you an adequate idea of the horrors of our ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in ſo ſmall a veſſel, driving about at the mercy of the waves and wind in a night, the pitchy darkneſs of which was only alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated by lightning, which ſerved to give us momentary views of the ſurrounding dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. And how ſhall I tell my dear Celia,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:029439_0480_0FE118FC649F0000"/>
that in the midſt of this diſtreſs and terror, I had one pang to encounter more acute by far than the near approach of expected death. Rookſby attached himſelf entirely to Clara. All his care, all his anxious ſolicitude was expreſſed for her. We had all riſen from our beds, Kingly ſupported his wife in his arms. "My dear boys," ſaid ſhe, "Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven protect them."—"Heaven will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect us all, I hope my love," ſaid he, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his hand acroſs his eyes.</p>
                     <p>Rookſby ſat in a diſtant corner of the cabin beſide Clara, who reſted her head up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſhoulder. Sad and ſolitary, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported myſelf againſt a table, that was faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to the cabin floor, and reſigning my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to that Power, who could in an inſtant either reſcue us from impending death, or plunge us at once into eternity—thus gave the reigns <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o reflection. Through every ſcene of my paſt life, how large has been my portion of miſery, and how ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, my allotment of joy: then why, coward ſoul, doſt thou ſhrink from the friendly ſtroke, that will ſet thee free from the heavy clog of mortality, and lift thee above theſe regions of tranſitory, fading joys, to one where pleaſure will be immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unchangeable and can never end!—Oh! Almighty Father of the Univerſe, weary as
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:029439_0481_0FE119012FCB2B20"/>
my pilgrimage has been, I acknowledge thy mercies have been ever beyond my deſerts; to thee then do I commit myſelf—do with me as thou wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>—only; Oh! benignant Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, grant me a portion of meekneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation equal to my afflictions. Thou art the Father of the fatherleſs; under thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting care my child will ever be ſecure. Do thou never forſake her in the hour of trial, and of thy mercy, grant ſhe may never forget thee. Forgive my manifold offences, as from my ſoul I pardon every offence I may have received from my fellow-creatures. As theſe reflections paſſed through my mind, I felt a calm ſerenity take poſſeſſion of my ſoul. I looked with an eye of complacency on Clara and Rookſby, whoſe horrors were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picted on their pale countenances, I even wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them peace of mind and fortitude to meet the impending danger as they ought. This world ſeemed fleeting from before my eyes, and I looked forward with humble hope, to that which was to come.</p>
                     <p>"Chearily! chearily! my dear couſin," ſaid Kingly, taking my hand, which hung motionleſs by my ſide, "come, come, we are worth half a dozen dead folks yet.—'Tis a tight little veſſel—my life for it, we weather the ſtorm, and this will be a ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:029439_0482_0FE11906A2051370"/>
for you. You will not be eaſily fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened after this."</p>
                     <p>"My dear Mrs. Rookſby," ſaid Mrs. Kingly, laying her hand on that of mine, which her huſband held, "how much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon you have, to hate me, and all my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily."</p>
                     <p>"Huſh," ſaid I, (frightened, leaſt ſhe was going to reveal my ſecret) believe me, I love and reſpect all of your family, whom I have ever known."</p>
                     <p>"Do not ſay ſo, thou much injured wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, look there, (pointing to Rookſby) You cannot eſteem that wretch, and yet you are linked to him for life, while the only man capable of rewarding virtue like yours: but no matter, 'tis I have done it all, and I deſerve to be unhappy."</p>
                     <p>I was greatly diſtreſſed to hear her talk in this manner. But before I could inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt her, ſhe thus continued.</p>
                     <p>"We are now, my dear couſin, hovering on the brink of eternity. Which of us, or whether any may eſcape the horrors of this awful night, heaven alone can tell; but we have both children. Promiſe me then my

friend, ſhould you ſurvive, to be a mother to my poor babes, while they ſhall require a mother's tender care: and ſhould it be my fate to eſcape and yours to periſh; here in my Maker's ſight, I ſwear to conſider your Clementina as my own child."</p>
                     <p>She had hardly ſpoke, when a ſevere ſhock which the veſſel received convinced us we had ſtruck on ſome rocks, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the deck iſſued a confuſed noiſe of "loſt! gone! all is over!"</p>
                     <p>Rookſby ſtarted from his ſeat and claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clara in his arms, ruſhed upon the deck: Kingly did the ſame by his wife. The love of life ſtill prevailed over the ſenſe of miſery and I followed them as well as I was able, crawling on my hands and knees up the ſteps. Kingly met me juſt as I had reached the top and taking me in his arms carried me to his wife. Here a new ſcene of horror diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itſelf; the day had begun to dawn juſt enough to ſhew us that we were on a reef of rocks which ran a conſiderable diſtance from the ſhore, and that the rage of the breakers, while the wind continued ſo violent would prevent any boat from coming to our aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>"See," cried Mrs. Kingly, "there is no hope." I could not anſwer.—We ſunk upon
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:029439_0484_0FE11910A6B0CCE8"/>
the deck folded in each others arms, Kingly knelt beſide and endeavoured to ſupport us, and thus in ſilent agony, we waited the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſhock when our veſſel would fall to pieces.</p>
                     <p>But it was near two hours before this event took place. At length unable to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the repeated ſhocks, ſhe parted and I ſaw Rookſby and Clara plunged into the waves.</p>
                     <p>My terrors and grief here became too great for human nature to ſupport and I loſt all ſenſe of my ſufferings. How long I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained inſenſible I cannot tell, but on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering my recollection, I found myſelf alone on the wreck, ſlightly faſtened to it by a ſmall cord, that was paſſed round my waiſt and tied to a ring on the remaining part of the deck.</p>
                     <p>The terrors which at that moment took poſſeſſion of my mind, are ſtill too freſh in my memory to ſuffer me to proceed.</p>

                     <p>I CONTINUED in this ſituation but a few moments—when I heard a faint voice call "Meriel," I turned my head and ſaw Kingly emerging from the ſea and holding by part of the wreck—"Oh, Heavens!" ſaid I, "are you alive then, and is there any chance of eſcaping?"—"Some little chance," ſaid he, coming near me and beginning to nutie the cord that was round me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="unknown:029439_0487_0FE1191BC6A99CB8"/>
"But where is Mrs. Kingly?"—"Safe, I hope," he replied, "I have conveyed her on board a coaſting veſſel, which you may ſee at no great diſtance from us; but which cannot come nearer on account of the wind blowing ſtrong in ſhore, and the ſea running ſo high a boat could not live in it. Come, my dear Meriel, throw off the moſt cumbrous part of your dreſs, the chance of ſaving you is but very ſmall; yet, ſhould I be ſo happy, I ſhall eſteem myſelf bleſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expreſſion, and ſhould I fail, I ſhall at leaſt have the ſatiſfaction of dying with the only woman I ever loved with ardency and ſincerity."</p>
                     <p>"No, Kingly," ſaid I, "if my life can only be preſerved at the hazard of your's, leave me, I beſeech you, to my fate. I am a poor forlorn creature of no conſequence to any one:—here let me lay down the burthen of painful exiſtence!—Do you return to your amiable wife. You may alone ſurvive the fury of the waves; but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbered with me, it will be impoſſible. Go, my kind, my dear friend, be a father to my child, and ſometimes think on her unhappy mother."</p>
                     <p>"Ceaſe, dear Meriel, ceaſe, thus to wound my heart, and trifle with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious moments in which I may ſnatch you
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:029439_0488_0FE1192099B72CF8"/>
from impending death. I once had fondly hoped to live only to render you happy;—but ſince fate has ordered it otherwiſe, I will preſerve your life or periſh in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt."</p>
                     <p>"Oh Kingly," I replied, "leave me, let me die while I am innocent. This gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conduct awakens all the ſoftneſs of my ſoul, and ſhould I live, I ſhall live only to endure the tortures of hopeleſs love, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered doubly agonizing by the pang of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious guilt."</p>
                     <p>"Deareſt, beſt of women," ſaid he, "let me but preſerve you, and certain I am that the rectitude of the heart that can harbour ſuch fears will ever preſerve you from the guilt it dreads."</p>
                     <p>The wind now ſeemed a little to abate. I plainly ſaw the veſſel coming nearer—"Now is the time," ſaid he, almoſt forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tearing off my upper garments, and binding a long ſhawl tight round my waiſt, he faſtened it to his arm, and catching me up plunged into the water. I now became once more inſenſible, nor do I remember the leaſt circumſtance that followed, till I awoke, as it were, from a profound ſleep, and found myſelf in a bed on board a ſmall dirty veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:029439_0489_0FE1192628841DB8"/>
I raiſed my head from the pillow and the firſt object which met my eyes, was Kingly on the oppoſite ſide of the cabin, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently dead.—Mrs. Kingly with a pale haggard countenance hanging over him; and ſtretched on a mattreſs, which was ſpread on the cabin floor, lay Clara and Rookſby juſt recovering from a ſtate of inſenſibility. Weak as I was I deſired to be lifted from the bed and crawling to that on which my preſerver lay, I began to enquire what means had been uſed for his recovery. I found eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper, every probable method had been tried without effect; they alſo informed me, that he was alive, when they took us up, but immediately on his getting on board, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture exhauſted with the exertions he had made to ſave me, had given way at once, and he ſunk lifeleſs on the deck.

For more than two hours we continued our applications without the leaſt appearance of ſucceſs; at length I was convinced I felt a faint palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the heart. I mentioned my hopes to his wife, who thought the ſame. This
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029439_0490_0FE11929ACB72C90"/>
gave us freſh courage, and in leſs than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hour we had the ſuperlative felicity of ſeeing him open his eyes. The rapturous expreſſions of joy that burſt from Mrs. Kingly on this token of returning anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are better imagined than deſcribed, nor was mine far ſhort of what ſhe expreſſed.—No ſooner were we aſcertained of perfect ſucceſs by his gently preſſing our hands and ſaintly articulating, "God bleſs you both," than burſting into tears of the moſt exult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rapture, we ſunk on our knees, and as we wept on each others boſom, poured forth our thanks to that benignant Power, who had crowned our humble exertions with ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Never Celia! no never! till that moment did I fully comprehend what real joy was: the tide of delight that ruſhed upon my heart when I heard him articulate the words "God bleſs you," more than compenſated for all the anguiſh I had ever endured. The veſſel which had taken us up, was bound to Calais, whither it now bent its courſe; the elements growing much calmer, and the wind becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more favourable, and we were once more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>We reſolved on ſtaying a day or two at Calais to recruit our ſpirits. Indeed we all found ourſelves aſtoniſhingly recovered after a good nights reſt, except Mrs. Kingly, who appeared weak and languid, was unable to ſit up and in the courſe of the day was ſeized with alarming faintings. Medical aſſiſtance was called in, but they declared her frame had received ſo ſevere a ſhock that in all human probability ſhe would fall into a rapid decline; however change of ſcene, chearful company, and invigorating medicines might prove great reſtoratives.—This was a heavy ſtroke to poor Kingly. We were unable to ſtay any longer than the next day with him and it was evident that his Margaret would not be able to travel ſo early. But there was no alternative; my mother's danger preſſed us to purſue our journey, and accordingly the next morning we took leave of the droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing patient angel, and her afflicted huſband, and ſet forward for Aix, flattering ourſelves that a few days would bring them to join us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="9" facs="unknown:029439_0492_0FE11934B7EC0658"/>
On our arrival at Aix, Clara left us, and we proceeded to my mother's. Amelia met us at the door. "Is ſhe yet alive?" ſaid I eagerly preſſing forward. "She is," replied Amelia, but greatly diſtreſſed. "We heard a packet was loſt and feared it was the one in which you had embarked."—Before I could anſwer I found myſelf in Mrs. Rookſby's chamber. The dear woman held out her hand to me as I entered; but was unable to ſpeak. Rookſby approached her bed-ſide, took her other hand, and preſſed it to his lips with reverence; but we all remained ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, I was pleaſed to ſee he ſtill retained ſenſibility enough to be ſhocked at his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's altered appearance. When ſhe was a little recovered, "my dear children," ſaid ſhe, preſſing our hands, "it diffuſes a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient gleam of pleaſure over my heart to ſee you once more, and to ſee you ſafe and happy; how have you left my ſweet Clementina, was ſhe well? does ſhe remember her grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother?"—I aſſured her ſhe was in health, and if any thing could remain on her infant mind, it muſt be the ſenſe of her grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's kindneſs and affection.—She ſmiled approbation, then turning to Rookſby—"Clement," ſaid ſhe, "you are arrived in good time to cloſe my eyes and to ſmooth my paſſage to the grave, by paſſing an act of amneſty with your amiable relation Captain

Onſlow. Come, promiſe me that the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling cauſe of your diſpute ſhall be no more remembered, and that you will rank him among the choiceſt of your friends. I know he longs to convince you, that his affection toward you is unaltered."</p>
                     <p>"Your wiſh, my dear madam," he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "muſt be to me a law. All our former differences are from this moment forgotten."—"'Tis well," ſaid ſhe; "then to-morrow I hope to ſee my dear Miſs Sidney exchange the name of virgin for that of wife. I ſhall then have nothing more to wiſh in this world.</p>
                     <p>Amelia made no affected objections to this propoſal, and that evening Captain Onſlow took his tea with us. When the articles were ſigned, in which he ſettles on my dear Amelia, five thouſand pounds, which was the bequeſt Mrs. Rookſby mentioned to have made in her will; he alſo preſented her with a very handſome watch, a pair of bracelets ſat with brilliants and a pair of diamond earings. The next morning ſhe accepted his hand at the altar with that modeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, free from every prudiſh affectation of baſhfulneſs, which ever diſtinguiſhes the real woman of ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>From that time no material occurrence took place for three or four days; only that

I obſerved my mother ſeemed more chearful, and I flattered myſelf that our united atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might contribute to her reſtoration, I carefully concealed not only from her, but even from Amelia, the cauſe I had for ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as I knew it would pain their friendly hearts, without in the leaſt relieving the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of my own; though I knew by the frequent and long abſences of Rookſky, that the chief part of his time was devoted to Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra. But why, thought I, ſhould I give my dear Amelia a bad opinion of a ſtate, into which ſhe had juſt entered, by revealing to her the art, the duplicity cruelty and perfidy of which man is capable. Will it not lead her to fear a future change in the huſband, who is now ſo fondly attached to her. Was not Rookſby once as fond of me, Oh! had he been like Kingly, hither tended all my reflections on the ſubject, I was terrified to find myſelf making theſe compariſons and ſtrenuouſly endeavoured to chaſe from my mind the only object on which it could dwell with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and grateful tenderneſs.</p>
                     <p>But theſe ideas were ſoon interrupted by the intruſion of ſome ſtill more painful. My dear Mother was one morning ſeized with a ſit of coughing and expired before I could reach her apartment, though I was called the inſtant the attendants perceived her danger,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029439_0495_0FE119431FE65DD8"/>
though her death was hourly expected by thoſe about her, I had vainly flattered myſelf ſhe might recover; I therefore felt her ſudden departure the more ſeverely, and as if my heart was not already overcharged with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction on the ſecond day after her deceaſe, Amelia entered my apartment with a letter open in her hand. There was an air of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and ſurpriſe about her countenance, which awakened my curioſity. My thoughts inſtantly reverted to England and my child. "Is Clementina ill"—cried I, eagerly, ſnatching at the letter.—"No!" ſhe repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, folding it up and putting it in her pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, while ſhe calmly ſeated herſelf beſide me, "the letter is not from England."—"Are you ſure of that Amelia," ſaid I, looking at her with a ſcrutinizing eye. "Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſo, my dear Meriel, but have you no other friends, in whoſe welfare you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted beſide thoſe you left in England." "Perhaps it is from Kingly?"—"You are right," ſhe replied, "and the contents are ſo much leſs dreadful than your mind for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boded, that I think I may commit it to your peruſal."</p>
                     <p>"Poor Margaret is worſe, I ſear," ſaid I, as I took the letter. She made me no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and I read it with a compoſure at which I have ſince been aſtoniſhed. I ſend

                     <p>MISS SIDNEY is the friend of Meriel Howard (for I will not call that dear woman by the name of her unworthy huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;) to her then I may addreſs myſelf and pour forth the ſorrows that lie heavy at my heart.</p>
                     <p>Oh, Amelia! unleſs you could for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment place yourſelf in my ſituation, you can have no idea of my wretchedneſs. My wife! my friend! my lovely! and beloved! Margaret is no more. I have taken up my pen to inform you of her placid, her hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly end:—but I feel I am unequal to the taſk.—I muſt pauſe.—My tears will flow.—in ſuch a cauſe the braveſt need not bluſh to indulge their ſenſibility.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="15" facs="unknown:029439_0498_0FE1194F31434460"/>
I am more compoſed—I have gazed on the ſerene countenance of my departed angel, and gathered fortitude from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of her virtues; from that bleſſed aſſurance, that the ſtroke which pierces my heart has ſecured to her felicity which will never end.</p>
                     <p>The diſorder which alarmed us ſo much, by its appearance, before Rookſby left Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais, terminated in an inflammation on the lungs and a putrid ſore throat occaſioned by the cold the dear creature had taken and the agitation her ſpirits had undergone. It made rapid advances. She knew her own danger, and ſeemed reſigned to quit the world, only that her heart yearned for her children: but even when ſhe thought of them, her pious ſoul extracted conſolation from the reliance ſhe placed on a divine guardian and protector to whom ſhe ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommended them.</p>
                     <p>Juſt before the laſt awful ſcene was cloſed, ſhe called me to her bed-ſide, "Kingly," ſaid ſhe, "I am going.—Four years of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative felicity is as much as humanity can expect. I am reſigned to my fate, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

thank my bountiful Creator that I have not lived to know the privation of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. That, my dear Frederic, I fear would have been a trial to which my forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude would have proved unequal. I need not recommend my children to your care. I am ſatiſfied you will never forget you are a father."</p>
                     <p>I aſſured her of my conſtant attention and undeviating affection to thoſe dear pledges of our love, and begged ſhe would not too much exhauſt herſelf by talking.</p>
                     <p>"I muſt ſpeak, my love," ſaid ſhe, "Alas! in a few hours that power will be denied me. I have ſomething of importance to ſay. You have been vilely deceived. Mrs. Rookſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ever loved you.—She is truth and purity itſelf."—</p>
                     <p>She was proceeding, when a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion ſeized her—and ſhe recovered only to ſpeak in incoherent ſentences—"Be the unalterable friend—She is worthy—In my cabinet you will"—She endeavoured to finiſh the ſentence, but in vain—her eyes cloſed—her gentle ſpirit fled forever!—</p>
                     <p>The anguiſh of my heart is better imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than deſcribed. Though I ever endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029439_0500_0FE11957ADF3FA20"/>
to promote the happineſs of my Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet; yet, when I reflect that I did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly love another, and that however, by the moſt grateful attention, I endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to veil my feelings from her, yet ſhe knew the ſituation of my heart, and knew the worth of the object. I cannot but fear it hurt her ſenſibility and preyed upon her ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall immediately return to England to attend her remains to their laſt dreary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſettle my children, diſmiſs my ſervants and ſolicit immediate employment; for idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will only be the nurſe of affliction, and it is my duty to live and endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my ſpirits that I may attend to the dear bequeſts of my Margaret, be father! mother! every dear relation to her children, and the firm friend of—I need not write her name. I have ſometimes thought her capricious and inconſiſtent, but the words "you have been viley deceived," have awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened ſentiments in my boſom, which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to indulge, tell her, my dear madam that while I live, I ſhall conſider myſelf as bound to ſupport! honour! and protect her! Alas! what right have I to protect her? is ſhe not the wife of another?—Yes ſhe is,—but that other is a villain, as ſuch every man
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:029439_0501_0FE1195D5F9E40E8"/>
of honour and ſenſibility has a right to ſtep forward in her defence.</p>
                     <p>"She is purity itſelf"—true but that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity cannot excel the pure the friendly affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that glows in my breaſt. A perſon who looks not beyond the ſurface of things, may think that theſe expreſſions are an inſult, a ſure mark of diſreſpect, to the memory of my departed Margaret, but you my dear madam will conſider them as they are meant a proof of my confidence in her veracity, a wiſh to fulfil her laſt deſire. Meriel is the wife of Rookſby.—My ſoul ever abhorred ſeduction of any kind; but to ſeduce a wife! a mother! horror! infamy!—the wealth of Indus, the joys of paradiſe would not tempt me to ſuch a meaſure. No, Margaret no! my beloved partner. Meriel may be the adopted mother of your children, may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant in their minds thoſe virtues which have ſupported her under all her afflictons, but for me, I will ſeek employment abroad, and fly from trials, which might be too powerful for me.</p>
                     <p>I have juſt received Rookſby's letter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming me of the death of his mother, and your union with Captain Onſlow. May

                     <p>MY dear Celia may perhaps be ſurprized that we did not attend the remains of our revered mother to England: but the obſtinacy of Rookſby was not to be over come, and I was afraid to leave him leſt by my abſence I ſhould appear to give a ſanction to a connection which though I could not entirely prevent, I was determined as much as poſſible to interrupt.

and her huſband were returning to England, and propoſed ſeeing the laſt duties fulfilled to my beloved parent, while I heavily and unwillingly attended Rookſby to Paris, where we were ſoon joined by Clara and Belger, the former of whom has now thrown aſide all reſtraint, appearing publicly as the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of Rookſby. Her houſe and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are elegant; ſhe gives ſplendid enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, and though her infamy is well known, ſhe is courted, followed and careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the faſhionable world; while I am left a poor ſolitary creature, in the midſt of a buſy multitude, without friend or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.</p>
                     <p>The parting with Amelia was like ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul and body.

My dear little girl has now been with me three weeks. Suſan Moſſop came over with her, Suſan is a lively girl and immediately attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the notice of Belger.

                     <p>When I left my pen and deſcended into the drawing room, the door of which ſtood partly open, I ſaw ſitting with his back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward me, a gentleman in deep mourning. He aroſe as I entered. Conceive my ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.—It was Kingly.</p>
                     <p>"My Kingly," ſaid I, endeavouring at a look of compoſure, while my pale counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and tremulous voice betrayed my emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.—He took my hand, led me to a ſopha and ſeating himſelf beſide me endeavoured in vain to reſtrain the tears that trembled in his expreſſive eyes.</p>
                     <p>"I have obtained an appointment, my dear Couſin" ſaid he recovering himſelf "and in a few months ſhall ſail on a three years

ſtation to America: but I could not leave Europe, without taking a perſonal leave of the beſt of women and recommending to her care my dear boys, Heaven only knows what may be the fate of their father. Say, ſhould I never return, will you be their mother, their counſellor, their friend?</p>
                     <p>"Surely Kingly," ſaid I eagerly, "you cannot doubt my readineſs to render them every ſervice, within the narrow compaſs of my power. The friendſhip I bore their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted mother,—"</p>
                     <p>"And is there nothing due to the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with which you once honoured their unhappy father. Ah Meriel! your lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deception is now of no avail: in my dear Margaret's cabinet I found a letter written by her own hand and addreſſed to me, in which ſhe explains every part of your conduct, which had before appeared ſo myſterious. Yes my conſtant, my ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Meriel, I am now ſatisfied, that you muſt have thought me the baſeſt of mankind, as I at one time believed you the moſt capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of women: but I can eaſily trace the black miſchief to the fountain head. Heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Moſſop, had frequently made me advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which it was impoſſible to miſtake.—Need I tell you I ſlighted her. Ah! my

beloved Meriel, how amply has her arts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged her ſlighted beauty."</p>
                     <p>He caught my hands, while I in vain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſuppreſs my tears; but unable to command my voice ſufficiently to anſwer him, I continued ſilent and he proceeded.</p>
                     <p>"My own diſappointment, my own ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings I have learned to bear without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining; but your's, dear Meriel, torture me beyond imagination. I ſee you married to a man, who ungratefully throws from him a gem, which might add ſplendor to a diadem. I ſee you unhappy; and feel I have not the power to alleviate your ſorrows.</p>
                     <p>"Your friendly anxiety," ſaid I "does me honour; and while I poſſeſs the eſteem of my friends I can never think myſelf totally unhappy. But you miſtake, in thinking Mr. Rookſby"—</p>
                     <p>"Pardon me Meriel, I know you would endeavour to draw a veil over his vices; but they are too glaring. All the world muſt ſee how you are injured!—Would to Heaven, Rookſby was not your huſband, or that there was any way to oblige him to do you juſtice without injuring your fame, which I would die to preſerve unſpotted."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="unknown:029439_0509_0FE11984AF070C18"/>
"Ah, Kingly!" ſaid I, "your life is too precious to be lightly thrown away. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider your children—for their ſake, for the ſake of your friends, preſerve it."</p>
                     <p>"And may I rank Mrs. Rookſby among thoſe friends, who are intereſted in my ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?"</p>
                     <p>"Do you doubt it Kingly? who is there on earth ſo dear?"—I pauſed—I recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected I was a wife—I was a mother!—The glow of ſelf-reproach, crimſoned my face. He ſunk on his knees before me.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! moſt adored of womankind! am I ſtill dear to thy heart?—Speak! finiſh the bleſſed ſentence! ſay you ſtill love me!—and I will live in the ſweet hope that ſome happy moment may arrive, when every bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier will be removed!"—He preſſed my hands to his boſom: my head ſunk upon his ſhoulder and my tears flowed without reſtraint. Oh, my Celia! let the prude, the rigidly virtuous blame me: the affection of my heart at that moment triumphed! I looked back to the time when to love him was no crime! the felicity I might, have enjoyed in his ſociety aroſe to my view! I felt, that ſpite of all reſiſtance, I ſtill loved him, and was ſtill ardently beloved—but at
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:029439_0510_0FE119899039BF60"/>
the ſame moment, I remembered I could never be his.—</p>
                     <p>"Believe me," ſaid I, "my heart has never wandered."</p>
                     <p>"Ten thouſand thanks!" cried he, wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kiſſing my hands. At that moment the door opened and Rookſby entered. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the ſcene that enſued would be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. I felt I had been to blame—I dared not aſſert my innocence, though I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten myſelf but for a moment.—"Deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed villian," ſaid he," darting a fierce look at Kingly; "and you prevaricating wretch, where now is your boaſted virtue?"—He at the ſame time ſeized me rudely by the arm: Kingly interpoſed—"Dare not to treat your wife injuriouſly—ſhe is an angel."</p>
                     <p>"An angel of darkneſs, I believe," ſaid he, contemptuouſly, "but I ſhall expect to ſettle this matter in another place."</p>
                     <p>"Rookſby," ſaid Kingly, with an air of dignity, "you are the huſband of Meriel Howard. I believe you do not doubt my courage: but worlds ſhould not tempt me to lift my hand againſt your life."</p>
                     <p>"Baſe ſubterfuge—cowardly villain!"—cried the enraged Rookſby, and ſtruck him.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:029439_0511_0FE1198EAB5EBCC8"/>
I ſaw no more. Senſe forſook me and when I recovered, I found they had left the houſe together. I am dreadfully agitated: Six hours have I paſt in the moſt agonizing ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; during which time, I have at inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals endeavoured to compoſe my perturbed ſpirits by writing:—But, alas! I can no longer proceed. Intereſted in the fate of both, ſhould they fight, I am deſtined to be unhappy.</p>
                     <p>Rookſby is returned—Kingly is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wounded, and in a few hours my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſets off for Italy. I return to England with my child; but Suſan Moſſop forſakes me in my diſtreſs and goes to Clara, where ruin and infamy, I fear, will ſoon overtake her. I ſhall write no more on this ſide the channel. Heaven grant that Kingly may recover, and Rookſby awaken to a ſenſe of his errors. Then may the pale meſſenger of peace beckon me from this vale of ſorrow to that bleſſed manſion, where the tear ſhall ceaſe to flow, and the heart be eaſed of its anguiſh.</p>

                     <p>THE haſty ſcrawl I wrote on my firſt arrival in England,<note n="*" place="bottom">Does not appear.</note> informed you of my ſafety; but there are many other things you no doubt wiſh to know, as you muſt have been ſurprized at my long ſilence. A variety of incidents have contributed to make me appear neglectful of my friend; but they are now all paſt, and I am ſettled in a little neat retreat far from the buſy ſcenes of life, where my chief occupation is the care of my ſweet girl. I think my Celia, after buffeting as I have done the waves of adverſity, the calm ſerenity of my little dwelling diffuſes a degree of comfort over my heart, to which it has long been a ſtranger.</p>
                     <p>On my arrival in England, I went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to our houſe in Harley-Street, where
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:029439_0513_0FE11998A1357AE8"/>
I ſpent a week in the moſt torturing ſuſpence expecting every day to hear of Kingly's death, as I had deſired a gentleman in Paris to inform me of that event immediately, if it ſhould happen, or in caſe of his recovery, to let me know when he was out of danger. My dear Amelia came to me the day after my arrival and every tender attention, which friendſhip could beſtow, I experienced from her and Captain Onſlow. At length the long expected letter arrived and I read, to my ſurprize and joy, that Kingly was in a fair way of recovery. This was an infinite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to my mind, and I began to regain ſome degree of compoſure, which was only inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the idea of parting with my friend Mrs. Onſlow, who was on the point of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying her huſband to India; but the privation of her ſociety was an event I was prepared to expect from the day of her marriage; I lamented it in ſilence, and only congratulated the dear woman on the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous proſpects that ſeemed to await her, without damping her ſpirits by a mention of my ſorrows of which her departure from England was not the leaſt.</p>
                     <p>She had not been gone above a month, when I was alarmed and terrified by an execution coming into the houſe, and on enquiring into my huſband's affairs, learned
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:029439_0514_0FE1199B6E3F7E28"/>
that his folly and Clara's profligacy had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved him in irretrievable embarraſſments; that he had mortgaged or ſold almoſt all his property and could not command a thouſand pounds clear in the world, except the eſtates which had been ſettled on me at my marriage and the ſmall one in Glamorganſhire, which he had preſented to me previous to our union. I conſulted with Mr. le Sage, a particular friend of Rookſby's whether any thing could be done to relieve him, and offered to cancel my marriage ſettlement; but of this he would not hear. However I determined to retrench every ſuperfluous expenſe in my houſe-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to diſcharge my ſervants and lay down my carriage. Having made this reſolution, I inſtantly ſet about the execution of it, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all my accounts and paid to the utmoſt of my power every thing due, I then told Mr. le Sage that I ſhould leave London and did not wiſh my place of reſidence to be known to many of my acquaintance; but that I ſhould eſteem it a favour if he would inform me, whenever he heard of Rookſby, and forward to me any letters that might come from the continent. I then with only two ſervants ſet forward for Glamorganſhire. I found the journey very fatiguing eſpecially when I drew near its concluſion. My income was now very confined yet I thought two hundred a year would be a ſufficient ſupport
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:029439_0515_0FE119A1329E4468"/>
for myſelf and child with economy, and would be a certain refuge for her, whenever I ſhould be no more. As to my marriage ſettlement I did not conſider it as my own, but held it merely with a view of being ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to my huſband in any future emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency. Do not think, my dear Celia, I mean to inſinuate that affection for Rookſby led me to act thus. No, that had long been extinct, gratitude had at one time awakened in my boſom an affection pure and tender, if not ardent, but his conduct ſince has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely extinguiſhed it, and whatever I do now proceeds from a motive of duty, and a conſciouſneſs of right. He is the father of my child. He is the man I have ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſed to prefer to all his ſex. Oh! Celia! what an awful ſtate is marriage and yet how thoughtleſsly do many ruſh into it. How ought we to reflect before we take a promiſe it may not be in our power to keep. While I live I hope my actions will ever be the reſult of principle, and that principle rectitude. Let me perform my duty chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and leave the event to heaven. But I am wandering. When I drew near the houſe which ſtands on my little farm, I was ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee how very deſolate it appeared, it had been untenanted two years and only a young man and his mother lived in one part of it; the one looked after the farm;
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:029439_0516_0FE119A512951868"/>
and the other milked the cows, made the butter and ſent it to market. Part of the garden was cultivated but the largeſt half was over-run with weeds. Rookſby had not ſeen it for ſeven years paſt, and in that time it had been ſadly neglected, ſo that though its original value had been two hundred pounds per year, it did not now produce half that ſum. A cold chillneſs ſeized my ſpirits as we drove up to the gate; the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had been taught to expect me for I wrote to the young man, that a couple of bed-rooms might be prepared and well aired; the coach ſtopped, the door was opened and from the houſe come—judge who, my dear Celia. Why no other than my dear old nurſe, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah Ellis. I do really believe, I ſcreamed with joy when I ſaw her. She, poor old ſoul, had no remembrance of me; but ſtood curt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying, and fearing my ladyſhip was very much fatigued. I followed her into the houſe—a ſmall parlour wore the appearance of comfort; a table was covered with a clean coarſe cloth, and in a few moments Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah brought in a couple of boiled chickens, a bottle of current wine, and every other appurtenance for dinner. I could not now withhold from diſcovering myſelf: but ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping her as ſhe was about to leave the room, "Deborah," ſaid I," have you forgot me Deborah." A ſilent look of enquiry and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:029439_0517_0FE119AA70931AB8"/>
ſurprize was her only reply. "Surely," ſaid I, "you muſt remember your poor little Meriel.—"Meriel madam! what my dear Miſs Meriel Howard?"—"Yes Deborah, your own Meriel, pray ſpeak to me, I am Meriel Howard."—She laid her hand on my arm and looking earneſtly in my face the large drops of joy chaſed each other down her aged countenance.—</p>
                     <p>"I think you are like her," ſaid ſhe, "but you are altered, you did not uſed to be ſo thin nor ſo pale." Then claſping me in her arms ſhe continued, "I know you now, for well I remember you was the child of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—</p>
                     <p>I then told her in as conciſe a manner as poſſible every occurrence that had paſſed ſince my removal to London, ſtill carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing every thing that might lead to the ſubject of my leaving ſo abruptly Woodbine cott, and the unhappy conſequences that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded it. But I can plainly diſcover ſhe too well gueſſes the cauſe of that elopement.—She comforted and conſoled me under my preſent circumſtances, and declared ſhe would never again be ſeperated from me. I learnt from her, that the mother of the young man who managed the farm, was her ſiſter, that ſhe was lately dead, and that ſhe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had come by her nephew's deſire to get
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:029439_0518_0FE119AFA67FF118"/>
the rooms ready for his lady's coming; but ſhe had, no thought of finding in that lady the dear little girl, whom ſhe had nurſed, and loved like a child of her own.</p>
                     <p>You will readily imagine, my dear Celia, that the preſence of Deborah greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to my comfort. I ſoon got ſettled, diſcharged my man ſervant, whom I had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged to accompany me on my journey, and with Deborah and Lucy, a young woman whom I had engaged to wait on myſelf and attend Clementina, I entered on an entire new way of life; and believe me, when I ſay, it is by far the moſt comfortable I have experienced for many years. Colin, Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah's nephew, ſuperintends the farm, which I flatter myſelf, will ſoon be in a flouriſhing ſtate. My old faſhioned caſements are overun with jeſmine and honey-ſuckle, and before my door, are a variety of roſes, pinks, ſweet-williams, and other flowers, which, though common are not leſs ſweet, than the rare and expenſive exotics that flouriſh in the green-houſes of the firſt noblemen in England. My parlour and dining room are ormamented with pots of myrtle, geranium, mignionet, and balm of giliad; the furniture conſiſting only of plain oak tables and neat matted chairs. My bed chamber and that of my child, is furniſhed with while dimity,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:029439_0519_0FE119B52F010908"/>
but made as plain as poſſible. Before I left London, I went to ſee Kingly's two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. They are in perfect health, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced where I think they will meet with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tenderneſs and attention. I engaged the lady under whoſe care they are placed, to write frequently and inform me of their welfare; for ſhould illneſs attack them, I ſhould not heſitate a moment to fly to their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. The world might perhaps, blame me, yet ſurely, my Celia, the world muſt be more unfeeling than I have even yet found it, ſhould the conduct of a woman incur its cenſure, who having a child of her own, loves and compaſſionates thoſe who are deprived of a mother's tenderneſs.</p>
                     <p>In this retreat then, my friend, I hope to paſs ſome few years in tranquillity. Even if Rookſby returns to England, he will be accompanied by Clara and I ſhould be only thought a troubleſome intruder; therefore, unleſs he requires it, I will not leave my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement. Could I be of any ſervice to ward off any impending misfortune, or comfort him under affliction; ſhould a declining ſtate of health require the kind attention of a nurſe, then will I fly on the wings of duty, and prove myſelf a wife and friend. But alas! I fear he may perhaps even quit the world without my either ſeeing him or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:029439_0520_0FE119B7A8BF7138"/>
where he is; for he has not wrote to me ſince we parted at Paris, and knowing as I do his impetuous temper, I am ſenſible, eſpecially connected as he is with ſuch a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as Clara, he may be drawn into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous quarrels. But I grow tedious on this ſubject, which is ever uppermoſt in my thoughts, and cruel as he has behaved to me, I daily offer up a prayer for his ſafety. Nay, ſometimes I fear, leaſt I have not loved him as I ought. Perhaps love ſo ardent as his, was quick ſighted and could diſcover the difference between paſſion and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: yet, from the firſt of our acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, I never attempted to deceive him or feign a tenderneſs I could not feel. Clara, I am certain has been the chief and only cauſe of alienating his affection from me.—I remember when I firſt knew her as Mrs. Moreton at Kenſington, I told her in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected openneſs of my heart every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of my my life, my ſincere attachment to Rainsforth, my misfortunes, my raſh and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent ſtep to relieve my mother. Theſe perhaps, with aggravated circumſtances have been repeated to Rookſby, and he has impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my union with him to intereſted motives. Nay, he might even think the reluctance I ſhewed to it at firſt was the effect of art.—Theſe reflections often lead me to think more favourably of his conduct than perhaps
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:029439_0521_0FE119BD768A18E0"/>
others will ſay it deſerves. While I ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved to him in one uniform manner, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, attentive, but calm and ſerene. Clara has no doubt affected the moſt impetuous paſſion and by his means has gained that aſcendency over him which I greatly fear will end but in his total ruin or death.</p>

                     <p>I have juſt received a letter from Kingly. He is going on a three years ſtation to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. May the God of Battles defend him. He had heard of Rookſby's misfortunes and ſent me a letter of credit on his banker; but of this no neceſſity whatever, ſhould tempt me to avail myſelf. No, Celia, I feel my heart too much oppreſſed already with the weight of obligation. I am already but too apt to make compariſons of what is, and what might have been my fate, and this ſhall be the laſt time I will indulge myſelf in writing of him to you. Speak of him, I cannot, as no perſon here knows him; and I will endeavour not to think of him, for when I remember that there is ſuch a man, I muſt alſo remember that it was he firſt taught my heart affection, it was he who ſaved my life almoſt at the expenſe of his own, and that poſſeſſed as he is of every
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:029439_0522_0FE119C26CF4E558"/>
amiable quality, he is unhappy.—Oh! human nature, how weak thou art!—Poor unſtable beings that we are, conſcious of our errors, we ſuffer reaſon to take the reins for a moment, and renounce them! But, ſcarce has the renunciation paſt our lips, perhaps in the very inſtant of ſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, ſome trifling circumſtance will awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the feelings of our hearts, and we, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly, return to thoſe very follies, the remembrance of which, had covered us with confuſion!—</p>
                     <p>Adieu!—dear Celia—remember me in your pious oraiſons, and continue to let me hear from you. I ſhall write, but my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will contain only the inſipid detail of what paſſes at my ſolitaty habitation, or the, perhaps, not leſs inſipid encomiums a fond mother will beſtow in enumerating the growing perfections of a darling child.—Oh! may that child live to be my comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. I will hide her from the world, and all its allurements: So, may ſhe never! never! feel its excruciating pains!—I will make my will, Celia, and leave this idol of my ſoul to your care, in caſe it ſhould pleaſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to deprive her of her mother. You, I know, will teach her that in the boſom of retirement, ſhe alone can find peace. Oh how bleſt the heart whoſe ſenſibility has
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:029439_0523_0FE119C736779A80"/>
never been awakened, who, though dead to all the joys of love or friendſhip, feels not the pang of diſappointment, or the pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſting of ingratitude!—Once more, Adieu!—May Heaven ever bleſs you.</p>

                     <p>HAVE you never heard, my dear Celia, that mariners, who are accuſtomed to the viciſſitudes of the unſtable element, never experience a long ſucceſſion of calm ſerene weather, but they hold themſelves prepared for a heavy ſtorm. The ſea is deceitful and the inexperienced ſailor may be loſt e'r he is aware of danger. This has been my caſe. Lulled into ſecurity by the calm I had been allowed to enjoy I fondly flattered myſelf that I ſhould ſink quietly into oblivion, forgetting and forgotten by the world. The accounts I heard of my huſband were vague and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable. I was at a loſs to think how he ſubſiſted. I was told he had ſunk into the deteſted character of a ſharper and gambler. He never wrote to me, never enquired for me; nay, I was once informed that he had ſpread a report of my death. A few days

                           <p>IT is with infinite regret I take up my pen to inform you of what I am ſenſible will give you the moſt lively affliction and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb that tranquillity, which through the exertions of your own good ſenſe you have for ſome time enjoyed.</p>
                           <p>Mr. Rookſby is in England. He arrived at my houſe laſt night extremely ill both in body and mind; he informed me in a few almoſt incoherent words, that he had killed a man at Bruſſels, where he has reſided for ſome time, that in the fray he met with a ſlight wound in his ſhoulder, which had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been properly dreſſed, as his ſervant had hurried him to England with the utmoſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and that he himſelf was unwilling to ſtop after croſſing the channel till he arrived in London.</p>

I found he was very much fatigued, and from the agitation of his ſpirits and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of the wound, very feveriſh. We perſuaded him to go to bed and ſent for a ſurgeon, who examined the wound and pronounced it ſlight; but in a bad way from being neglected. He was very reſtleſs all night, and towards morning I thought rather wild in his diſcourſe, I aſked him if I ſhould ſend for you,—"ſend for who" ſaid he, raiſing himſelf haſtily, for "Mrs. Rookſby? for which of them," ſaid he, wildly "I have two wives."—I thought this was a certain indication of delirium and forbore to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him, but he caught hold of my hand and obliging me to ſit down thus continued, "if you mean Meriel, I have injured her too much to expect ſhe will come, and as to Harriet, or Clara—Oh! do not tell Clara where I am!"—He then appeared violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agitated and ſoon after raved in a very incoherent manner. I thought, madam, it was neceſſary you ſhould be informed of his unhappy ſituation, and therefore ſend an expreſs off with this immediately, requeſting you will ſet off for town as quick as poſſible; your preſence may in ſome meaſure calm his perturbed ſpirits, and be the means of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, which I believe the Phyſician con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders at preſent very doubtful.

                     <p>YOU will readily believe, that when the ſhock my ſpirits had received was a little ſubſided, I ſat about haſty preparations for my journey: I took Lucy with me and left Clementina in the care of Deborah. I made but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="45" facs="unknown:029439_0528_0FE119DC37A63F10"/>
—But when I alighted in Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck Street, and attempted to walk up ſtairs, I found the exertion was beyond my ſtrength, and I ſunk almoſt inſenſible on the landing place. Mr. Le Sage was very attentive and friendly, as was alſo his amiable daughter; and by their kindneſs I ſoon found myſelf able to enquire after poor Rookſby. They told me he was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he knew I was expected, and, that he was impatient to ſee me. I rallied my ſpirits, and having at the requeſt of my kind hoſt taken a glaſs of wine, I proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſick chamber. I approached the bed cautiouſly.—Good Heavens!—what havoc has intemperance and ſickneſs made in his perſon? How little ſhould I have known him for the blooming elegant Clem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Rookſby, whom only ſeven years before I had accepted as my huſband. Pale, ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated, and haggard was his countenance; his words ſo weak they could not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. He fixed his eyes for an inſtant on me; his lips moved, he ſtretched one hand out toward me and with the other covered his face. I took the offered hand; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion overpowered reſentment; I raiſed it to my lips and wet it with my tears.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! thou dear generous woman," ſaid he ſaintly, "I have not deſerved this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs

—I am a wretch, unworthy of your notice: but you are an angel of mercy come to whiſper pardon to my ſoul that I may die in peace."</p>
                     <p>"You will live many years yet," ſaid I, "many years in comfort and health."</p>
                     <p>"Never," ſaid he, eagerly, "I do not wiſh to live. Health may return: but my heart will never know peace nor joy again; therefore. 'twere well, if it were cold and motionleſs. But, oh! my beloved—I do not deſerve to live and I am afraid to die!"</p>
                     <p>Here the nurſe interpoſed, and I was forced to leave him; for while I ſtayed, he perſiſted in talking to me, which irritated the diſorder. I had not left him long, when he ſent to know if I had brought Clementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na with me; and ſeemed greatly diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when he found I had not. His anxiety of ſee the child, pleaſed me, and tempted me to write to Deborah to come with her to town immediately. The tender aſſiduity, which inclination prompted me to ſhow my poor Rookſby, accelerated his recovery and in about ſix weeks I had the pleaſure of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him able to bear a removal to a ſmall houſe we had taken at Pimlico. I had care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoided ſuffering him to dwell on paſt diſagreeable circumſtances and endeavoured

by every means I could deviſe, to direct the melancholy I ſaw daily increaſing; but my attempts were vain, and indeed had I known the real ſource of that melancholy, my own heart would have been equally oppreſſed.</p>
                     <p>We had been in our new habitation, but a fortnight, when one morning as we were at breakfaſt; two men entered and arreſted Rookſby for a debt of five thouſand pounds. which he told me was a gaming debt, and the ſame which had involved him in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky quarrel at Bruſſels as he ſuſpected the perſon who won it of him, did not win it fairly. I cannot tell you what I felt. Weak and low as he was, it was death to ſee him conveyed to a priſon, yet that I knew muſt be the inevitable conſequence of the arreſt, as I had no means to extricate him from that and ſeveral others of a ſimilar nature, for which he had been draw in to give his note. With a heart almoſt breaking I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I knew his cold Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy would ſtrongly oppoſe my giving up my ſettlements. Yet ſure, my dear Celia, I ſhould have been wrong to heſitate a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or out of a pretended care for the future welfare of my child to ſuffer her

father oppreſſed with ſickneſs and tortured by remorſe, forſaken by thoſe gay triflers, who once called themſelves his friends, to waſte the remainder of his wretched life in a priſon.</p>
                     <p>"When I had given every proper direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the raiſing what money we could, and endeavouring to bring the unjuſt holders of his notes to ſome compoſition, I viſited him in his ſad abode and endeavoured to chear and comfort him. That duty fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I returned to my ſolitary home and taking my dear girl on my lap gave a free vent to tears which flowed from real anguiſh of heart.</p>
                     <p>Deborah brought in my tea. She ſhut the windows, ſtirred the fire and twice at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſpeak; but the honeſt creature's own feelings were too acute to permit her to comfort me.</p>
                     <p>My poor Clementina, from ſympathy had laid her dear head on my boſom and mixed her tears with mine "Mamma is ſick, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah," ſaid ſhe. Deborah took her ſilently from me, wiped off the tears that trickled down her innocent face; once more attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpeak, but unable to articulate turned haſtily from me and wept aloud.

this ſcene of mute ſorrow would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued I know not; but we were arouſed from it by a coach <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> and a loud rap at the door. I trembled, I knew not why; I wiſhed not to ſee any viſitors, yet had not preſence of mind to forbid any one being admitted, and before I could compoſe my countenance or wipe away the traces of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from my face the door opened and a moſt lovely young woman entered. Her dreſs was ſecond mourning, neat in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme and ſhe was viſibly pregnant. Her looks were characteriſtic of modeſty and truth. Her manners at once attractive and commanding, ſuch as ſhe appeared to me at that moment, fancy now repreſents her to my mind, and I find, ſorrowful as my heart is, it has yet a vulnerable part that feels for her afflictions.</p>
                     <p>She curtſyed and with a look and voice humility entreated pardon for the intruſion, ſhe had hoped to have found Mr. Rookſby at home. "He will not be at home to-night madam," ſaid I, as I entreated her to be ſeated, "but if you will favour me with your commands I will ſerve you to the utmoſt of my power."</p>
                     <p>"Pardon me, madam," ſaid ſhe, "com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are not for the unfortunate, I came
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:029439_0533_0FE119F40EBEA0B0"/>
not to command but entreat.—To entreat Mr Rookſby will call to his rememberance an unhappy woman, who deprived of his friendſhip muſt be forever loſt."</p>
                     <p>"If you mean Mrs. Millar, madam," ſaid I with ſome ſurprize. "I am aſtoniſhed ſhe could employ ſo reſpectable a perſon on ſo very improper a meſſage."</p>
                     <p>"Alas! madam I do not know Mrs. Millar, I have indeed heard of her and that ſhe had uſed Mr. Rookſby extremely ill, but it is not for her I would plead, it is for myſelf."</p>
                     <p>"Yourſelf," cried I, in breathleſs agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, "Does he owe you money."</p>
                     <p>"Oh no! no! he owes me ſuccour and ſupport, I am his wife! and he has forſaken me." I believe the wildneſs of my looks terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied her; for ſhe caught hold of my hand and thus proceeded.—"Dear madam, do not be angry, you perhaps are his ſiſter, you blame the unequal alliance. I was poor, madam; but indeed, I will never diſgrace the name he has honoured me with."</p>
                     <p>She might have proceeded longer without interruption. A ſudden ſtupefaction ſeemed
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:029439_0534_0FE119F7D4103B00"/>
to deprive me of ſenſe or feeling. This agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of my calamities was more than I could bear, and nature ſunk under the ſhock. She was alarmed and haſtily rung the bell. The entrance of Deborah and the child awakened me to ſenſibility, and the tears which the dreadful diſcovery I had juſt made had ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, now guſhed forth afreſh. I gave them free vent, and thanked heaven for the relief they gave my heart. When I became a little compoſed, I reflected on the ſad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence I had to communicate to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate gueſt. At one moment I reſolved in compaſſion to her ſituation to hide the truth from her; yet on reflection that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared impoſſible. My next care was how to break it to her in the tendereſt manner; I invited her to partake my repaſt, and ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her by the kindeſt attention; yet by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees hinted to her that all was not as it ſhould be, that I feared her expectations would be greatly diſappointed, that Rookſby was in trouble, and I would adviſe her at that time not to attempt to ſee him.</p>
                     <p>"But if he is in affliction, madam, is it not my duty to fly to him, though he has forſaken me."—"I fear, my dear, you would meet a ſhock, ſhould you attempt to ſee him. He at preſent could not with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety receive you."—"Could not,—per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:029439_0535_0FE119FCEB0F8770"/>
you think he would not?"—"I do not mean ſo. I never heard him mention you; but I know there are very forcible reaſons againſt his receiving you; reaſons which make it altogether impoſſible for you to be with him.—Yet do not be alarmed though Mr. Rookſby cannot I will be your friend.</p>
                     <p>It ſeemed as at one moment ſhe had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the extent of her misfortune, for ſtarting haſtily from her ſeat ſhe cried "Oh! I ſee it all, you, you madam, are not his ſiſter, you are his wife, and I am undone forever!"</p>
                     <p>To give a proper force to the ſcene during the reſt of the evening would be impoſſible. I detained her with me and in the language of the pureſt ſimplicity, ſhe told a tale that for a moment ſtole me from my own ſorrow, to lament hers. I have requeſted her to commit it to writing that I might tranſmit it to you. She has complied and bid me tell you if ſhe can ſave enough from the wreck of her little fortune to pay her entrance ſhe will come and in your convent bury her ſhame and her misfortunes. Oh! my Celia, ſhould ſhe come, receive her with the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a ſiſter, and ſtrive to alleviate the ſorrows of her heart. She is innocent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpecting, and full of ſenſibility. Comfort

                     <p>I ARRIVED in England, dear Onſlow, juſt in time to adminiſter relief to the moſt amiable, moſt lovely of her ſex. When I went to viſit my dear boys, I enquired when they had ſeen Mrs. Rookſby. They told me that for ſome time paſt they had neither ſeen or heard from her. I then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to Le Sage, who I knew was Rookſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by's banker. From him I learned that Rookſby was in priſon, and the dear wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Meriel in diſtreſs for even the common neceſſaries of life. Her child, her beloved Clementina had been ill with the meaſles, and was even then in the utmoſt danger from a diſorder which had ſettled on her lungs. I haſtened to ſeek her out, and found her, Onſlow, in a ſmall lodging up three pair of ſtairs, in the vicinity of the King's bench priſon, where her unworthy
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:029439_0541_0FE11A16E2A9BBC8"/>
huſband was confined. When I entered the room, ſhe was kneeling by the bed-ſide, her face, her hands, elevated towards that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven whoſe mercy ſhe ſupplicated in behalf of her dying child. Beſide her knelt two lovely intereſting boys, whom I afterwards learned were the children Rookſby had by Clara. I ſpoke to her. She took but little notice of me, for the feelings of a mother had abſorbed every other. She ſigned for me to ſit down, and pointing to her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter looked unutterable anguiſh. I enquired whether ſhe had proper advice and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; her anſwer cut me to the heart. She had not the means to procure proper medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal advice!—Every thing of value had been diſpoſed of to ſupport her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.—I did not remain long with this dear ſuffering angel!—But ſent a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician and a nurſe to her, telling the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I would defray every expence—for will you believe it, Onſlow, the dear crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though reduced to the utmoſt diſtreſs, had never availed herſelf of the letter of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit I ſent her previous to my departure from England. On the third day after this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement, I called to enquire how ſhe was and found her ſweet little girl had juſt breathed her laſt. That was not a time to offer conſolation. I took the two boys from her, and gave orders for the funeral.
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:029439_0542_0FE11A19C3326F88"/>
She had a very decent woman with her, whom ſhe called Deborah, and who I ſaw was both reſpectful and affectionate in her behaviour. I thought my company at that time might be more intruſive than welcome; beſides I was ſenſible the world was ever ready to cenſure an unhappy woman, who in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs met with friendſhip, however diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted from our ſex. I therefore determined to wait till the funeral was over, before I attempted to ſee my dear afflicted Meriel; but on the very evening that the child was buried, I received a meſſage from Deborah, ſaying her miſtreſs was extremely ill, and ſhe wiſhed I would come to her immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I had been told that my adored girl had once before from the effect of a very heavy affliction, loſt her ſenſes for ſome days—(though what that affliction was, I never learned.)—But from this intelligence, I was prepared to find the ſame misfortune had befallen her. I was not deceived. She was writing when I entered the room, to a Miſs Shelburne, with whom ſhe ſpent the early part of her life in a convent at Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne, ſuch a letter, Onſlow, as would melt the moſt obdurate heart. I waited till ſhe voluntarily reſigned her pen, which ſhe ſoon did, when folding her letter and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, as though I was her ſervant ſhe bade me make haſte with it to the Poſt
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:029439_0543_0FE11A1F65DDEC88"/>
or I ſhould be too late. It was by ſtratagem I got her to accompany me home, where I provided medical and other aſſiſtance. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah has faithfully attended her, and I am told ſhe is now in a fair way of recovery, though her ſenſes are ſtill wandering.—During her confinement I have taken care that Rookſby ſhould want for nothing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I believe it is the firſt wiſh of the dear creature's heart. But I cannot bring myſelf to ſee or converſe with a man, who has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſo noble a mind as Meriel Howard's to inſanity; for ſure I am, her mental facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties muſt have been greatly weakened by prior afflictions or ſhe would not ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully have felt the loſs of her child. Her pious ſoul, if in the unimpaired uſe of her reaſon, would have ſeverely felt the privation but ſtill ſubmitted with patience.—</p>
                     <p>Deborah ſends for me. May it be good tidings from her, who is all in all to me, and who though the wife of another, poſſeſſes my tendereſt affection. Blame me not, my right was prior to his, and believe me my affection is pure as the ſoul of her who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires it.</p>
                     <p>She is reſtored to reaſon, thanks be to heaven for it, I have not yet ſeen her, nor does ſhe know in whoſe houſe ſhe is; but I
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:029439_0544_0FE11A2290D99170"/>
am all joy at the fair proſpect of her return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing health. Tell your lovely amiable wife that every exertion neceſſary for the reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her friend ſhall be uſed, and that I hope my next letter will inform you of her perfect recovery. God bleſs you. May I ſee my dear Meriel in health before I am or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered again to leave England and I ſhall go without regret. Adieu,</p>

                     <p>ONCE more ſnatched from death, or what is to a thinking mind far worſe, a total deprivation of reaſon; I have next to an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty providence, to render thanks and bleſs the hand of Kingly. Why am I doomed to be thus obliged, where I have no power to return the obligation but by grateful prayers and tears; I have ſome faint recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of having wrote you a letter after the death of my beloved Clementina; but I fear it was very incoherent and hardly intelligible; but I will now endeavour to go back to the period when the poor young creature whom my huſband had ſo vilely deceived came to my houſe at Pimlico. I reſolved to prevent her, if poſſible, from ſeeing Rookſby, as I knew it would only irritate his ſufferings, without in the leaſt alleviating her own; I therefore prevailed on her to remain with
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:029439_0546_0FE11A2AC47265B0"/>
me till I could form ſome plan that might be of uſe to her; and as I every day expected Kingly in England, I thought he might render himſelf of ſervice to her, without ſubjecting her to the unjuſt cenſures, which would be caſt on me ſhould I accept favours from his hands.</p>
                     <p>My time paſſed wretched enough for three weeks. At the end of that time I perceived that Harriet, which was the name of my <hi>Protegéé</hi> appeared ſomewhat more chearful and on enquiring the cauſe, ſhe informed me that ſhe was certain ſhe had ſeen her mother's brother paſs our houſe frequently, that ſhe had inquired his name and learned it was the ſame ſhe had thought it to be, that he lived in the neighbourhood and was a wealthy widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er without children. From this information Harriet had conceived the idea of writing to him and faithfully explaining her unhappy circumſtances. She ſhewed me the copy of a letter ſhe had prepared, which as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the chief events of her life, I requeſted leave to ſend to you. I incloſe it, and as it is neceſſary you ſhould read it before I proceed I ſhall here break off.</p>

                     <p>PERHAPS, my dear and honoured uncle will be both ſurprized and offended to receive a letter from one whom no doubt he has heard, conducted herſelf in a manner that has thrown an odium on her family, I have been to blame, greatly to blame, but not ſo very culpable as you and perhaps all the world imagine.</p>
                     <p>I am fully ſenſible of the many diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages I labour under, while addreſſing you, yet when I remember that out of a numerous family you were the only one, who ſhewed a friendſhip for my poor mother when her union with my father ſo highly offended all. When I recollect the many inſtances of your affection I have myſelf witneſſed when I was but a child, I cannot but hope you will not turn away from the daughter of that once loved ſiſter.—Oh! why was I ſo early de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:029439_0548_0FE11A34E0773010"/>
of her maternal affection, or why did not the ſame ſtroke that ſnatched her from the world take alſo her unhappy daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for ſurely of all the forlorn beings the world contains a girl deprived of her mother is the moſt pitiable. She may, it is true, meet with relations or friends that will in ſome meaſure ſupply her place, but alas! they will not have the watchful care, the fond ſolicitude of a mother. Had I never loſt that dear parent I ſhould not have been the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate creature I am; for there is a ſort of taliſmanic virtue in the very name of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that while it fills our hearts with ſenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons undeſcribably delightful, is tempered with ſuch awe, ſuch fear of giving pain or incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring diſpleaſure, that it muſt be a very inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible daughter who would wilfully do either.</p>
                     <p>My dear father was the tendereſt, the fondeſt of parents, and ſtrained, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, his little income, to procure for me an education befitting a gentlewoman. He placed me as a boarder in a convent near Abbeville, his place of reſidence, that he might keep a watchful eye upon my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; for the honour of his family and that of my mother's were ever dear to his heart, and he often ſaid that he would ſooner ſee me in my coffin, whilſt a child, than have me live to fully the name I bore and the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:029439_0549_0FE11A3A0729D8D8"/>
family I ſprung from. My life paſſed in uninterrupted tranquillity, 'till I was ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, at which period a Mademoiſelle St. Farr was going to leave the convent and marry. She had ever conceived a great eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem for me, was five years older than my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and had reſided in the convent from the death of her father, which happened when ſhe was very young. She was a woman of an enlightened underſtanding, lovely in her perſon and elegant in her manners. She ever preſerved that dignity, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders our ſex reſpectable, yet mixed it with ſuch charming vivacity, ſuch ſprightly wit and unaffected good humour that ſhe at once commanded reſpect and conciliated affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I have been thus minute in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Mademoiſelle St. Farr, that you might not be ſurpriſed at my father's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy compliance with a requeſt ſhe made, that I ſhould accompany her to Bruſſels, and remain with her during the winter ſeaſon. Young and volatile my heart bounded at the proſpect of the liberty and pleaſure I hoped to enjoy under her protection. Her huſband Monſieur Melville was a gallant man, and from the day of their marriage, promoted every entertainment that he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined could give pleaſure to a young beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful woman, juſt emerged from the gloom of a convent. But Madame Melville was a
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:029439_0550_0FE11A3D49099D28"/>
woman of too much diſcernment to ſuffer diſſipation and folly to have a moments aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendency over her mind. After ſharing in the amuſements of Bruſſels a few weeks, ſhe expreſſed a wiſh of living in a more domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic manner, and retired to an elegant cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theaux, which her huſband poſſeſſed on the banks of the Seine. Thither I accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her: but, alas! ſir, my weak mind had been faſcinated with the pleaſures of the gay world, and I had loſt all taſte for retirement, and rational ſociety. The account in ſome meaſure for this change I muſt candidly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, that during my ſtay at Bruſſels I had formed an acquaintance with an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh gentleman of the name of Rookſby.—He was a man of fortune, lived in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive ſtile, and (I bluſh while I own it,) at that very time lived publicly with a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of an abandoned character.</p>
                     <p>But, he had paid me numberleſs atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and a profuſion of compliments, ſo faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinating to the inxeperienced female heart, that I fancied, (fatal miſtake!) had he an affectionate wife, whom he loved; ſhe might reclaim him from the follies of which he ſeemed ſo fond. He had often profeſſed a paſſion for me, but not openly, and there my errors commenced; for at his requeſt I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore to mention his pretenſions of Monſieur
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:029439_0551_0FE11A4326264028"/>
or Madame Melville. That lady ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the alteration in my ſpirits, after my leaving Bruſſels, and inquired into the cauſe. I evaded her kind queſtions: and ſoon after her brother coming to their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theaux on a viſit brought Rookſby with him. My chagrin vaniſhed; I was again chearful and happy. A change ſo viſible could not eſcape Madame Melville's penetration; ſhe imagined it might be the attractions of her brother (who was in every reſpect her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpart) which had made an impreſſion on my heart. With a ſmile ſhe entreated my confidence; but by the unembarraſſed air with which I anſwered her interrogations ſhe diſcovered her error. The ſmile was chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a look of apprehenſion. "I hope Harriet, ſaid ſhe, you have not liſtened to any flighty tales from that young Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. I do not like his character. My brother brought him here from a motive of friendſhip to endeavour to detach him from a ſet of gamblers, who in combination with a very vile woman, are leading him blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold to ruin. He is a very weak young man, and poſſeſſes no ſtability."</p>
                     <p>After this converſation ſhe kept a very ſtrict eye upon me, and ſoon diſcovered enough to make her think it neceſſary to ſend me back to the convent ſooner than ſhe at
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:029439_0552_0FE11A46D8646A50"/>
firſt intended. Rookſby followed me—I had not attempted to conceal from him the ſentiments he had inſpired me with. We found means to correſpond: he laid a plan for my eſcape from the convent, I followed his pernicious councils, and we were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately married; but under a ſtrict injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never to divulge our marriage till he ſhould give me leave. Imagining that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him was now become my firſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I took a moſt ſolemn oath, never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal our union, though by ſo doing, I could avert the heavieſt misfortune. Gracious Heaven! how little did I ſuſpect the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful calamity, which then hovered over my head? Happy as I was, in having, as I then thought, ſecured him to myſelf, I ſtill felt a conſiderable alloy from the reflection that I had acted undutifully to my dear father; that I planted a dagger in his heart, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps incurred his heavieſt malediction, yet dared not ſue to him for pardon. Another ſource of diſquiet was, that whenever Mr. Rookſby was abſent for any length of time, I ſuſpected he was with Clara the woman he had ſo publicly kept. To divert the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, theſe fears occaſioned, he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed going for a few weeks to Paris, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I accompanied him. I had been there but ten days when one night, as I was at the opera, dreſſed in the gayeſt ſtile and in
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:029439_0553_0FE11A4CD3D3FD20"/>
company with a woman to whom he had introduced me. Juſt as the performance began, I ſaw Madame Melville enter a box oppoſite to me, led by a gentleman whoſe face was from me. Judge, my dear ſir, if poſſible, my emotions, when he turned round to ſeat himſelf, I diſcovered my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. His pale dejected countenance ſtruck me with horror, an involuntary ſhriek eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped me, he raiſed his eyes, he ſaw!—he knew me!—"Great God!" ſaid he, claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hands, and ſunk from the ſeat in a ſtate of inſenſibility. What my feelings were at that moment, I will not, I cannot pretend to deſcribe; nor can I tell how I got round from the box where I ſat to the one that contained my father. All was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; but the diſtraction of my brain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented my attending to any thing, but my parent, whom I ſaw before me to all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance dead!—And, alas! bitter reflection, murdered by my ingratitude and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence!—</p>
                     <p>When he began to recover, madame Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville hurried him out of the houſe, and I followed them almoſt unknowingly into the carriage. My father ſuffered me to hold his hands in mine, but did not ſpeak to me during the time we were going to Madame Melville houſe. When we alighted, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:029439_0554_0FE11A509E5F2198"/>
he trembled ſo he could ſcarcely ſtand. I followed him into a parlour, where he ſunk upon a ſopha. I fell on my knees before him. Forgive me, father, dear father, forgive me."</p>
                     <p>"Harriet," ſaid he, "what am I to think from your appearance.—tell me, tell me inſtantly and without prevarication.—Are you married?"</p>
                     <p>"Do not aſk me, I cannot anſwer."—"Enough," ſaid he, "I underſtand my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour."—Oh! my father, will you not pronounce my pardon?</p>
                     <p>"Yes," ſaid he feebly, "may heaven eternally bleſs you and forgive you as I do now." When I heard of your departure from the Convent it was like a bolt of ice ſhot through my heart. Oh! child, I have not had a moments peace ſince; but, if my pardon can give you comfort, from my ſoul I pardon you—But you are diſhonoured. Oh! my child, how have you forgot what was due—</p>
                     <p>He was proceeding; but his voice faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and his head ſunk on my ſhoulder, I thought it was a return of his faintneſs, and ſhrieked for help. Alas! how ſhall I
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:029439_0555_0FE11A55F5DA25E8"/>
proceed. The horrors of that moment will never be blotted from my memory. We raiſed and laid him on the ſopha, we ſtrove to revive him; but in vain. His noble ſoul had never known diſhonour, and the ſprings of life before exhauſted by ſickneſs and many afflictions gave way at once under the preſſure of a calamity he was not prepared to bear. Oh! ſir, when I reflect on that night, when I remembered it was my folly, viper that I was; that ſtung him to the heart, my brain turns round, and only that he forgave me, with his parting breath, the very idea would deprive me of reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Madame Melville ſuffered me to remain at her houſe till the laſt duties ware paid to his beloved remains; but as my character was now become equivocal, ſhe forbore ever after to ſhew me any countentnce. I ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely lamented the privation of her friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the more as I found it was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that was followed by every woman of character with whom ſhe was acquainted.</p>
                     <p>My ſituation on that account became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely painful, and I mentioned to Mr. Rookſby, my deſire of returning to Abbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, to take poſſeſſion of the ſmall patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony my father had left me. He acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſced, and we ſet forward immediately.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="73" facs="unknown:029439_0556_0FE11A589FE4F290"/>
Three months, three little months, paſſed on in tranquillity, when my huſband inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me he had particular buſineſs which call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to Bruſſels, that it would be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to return, and he thought it moſt expedient to ſell off what furniture, &amp;c. we poſſeſſed, and to ſettle at that place.—Alas! my dear ſir, fond of his ſociety, and having no will but his, I heſitated not to comply.</p>
                     <p>At Bruſſels, a new ſcene preſented itſelf; a ſcene which gave me a pain, impoſſible to deſcribe! and which no one but a wife who loved as I did can poſſibly conceive.—Mr. Rookſby renewed his connection with a ſet of gamblers and ſwindlers, who live on the follies of the unwary.—He became their dupe and in a few months was a very beggar.—It was one hot afternoon, in the middle of Auguſt laſt, when overcome by the weight of the atmoſphere, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by my own reflections, I had retired to an arbour, which terminated the ſmall ſpace of garden belonging to the houſe we occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, and was endeavouring to divert my ſorrow, by the peruſal of an Engliſh novel, which had been recommended to my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. I was deeply intereſted in the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of the "Welſh Heireſs," (who never having known the pleaſures of maternal ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:029439_0557_0FE11A5E336CFE48"/>
felt her heart expand towards thoſe whoſe affection ſupplied the place of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.) My mind was occupied, my heart ſoftened, the tears ſtole from my eyes, but they were tears that flowed from a ſource ſo pleaſing, I wiſhed not to ſtop their courſe: for while ſympathy for poor Anna's diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes awakened my ſenſibility, I felt the moſt exquiſite delight in the remembrance that there was an author, a female author<note n="*" place="bottom">Mrs. Bennett, author of <hi>Juvenile Indiſcretions,</hi> &amp;c.</note>, who in conjunction with a Burney and Lee would ſnatch the Britiſh novel from oblivion, and future ages ſhould with pleaſure peruſe the productions of her pen. Pardon me, ſir, but with ſuch fervour do I revere thoſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively happy few, who to a brilliant culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated underſtanding, add a fertile natural genius, an elegant refined taſte, and great ſenſibility, all other ſubjects are forgotten, and I am like a rapt enthuſiaſt, all wonder and veneration. But to return to myſelf, I was employed in the peruſal of the Welſh Heireſs, when Rookſby with a hurried ſtep and embarraſſed air entered the arbour: he ſat down beſide me, ſtruck his hand againſt his forehead, and breathed a ſigh that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come from his heart. My dear uncle muſt have a bad opinion of my heart, if he thinks fictitious diſtreſs could longer engroſs my thoughts, and though he had been from
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:029439_0558_0FE11A61730D9C50"/>
me then above a fortnight, yet as I knew he was my huſband—I alſo knew it was my duty to receive him on his return with a ſmile, and, if poſſible, alleviate the afflictions which ſeemed to oppreſs him. I threw aſide my book and taking his hand inquired the cauſe of this viſible dejection. He told me he was ruined paſt redemption, that he had even loſt more than he poſſeſſed the means to pay.—Unexperienced, my heart overflowing with affection, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſooth his ſorrows; and to calm the immediate perturbation of his mind, I put into his hands almoſt the whole of my worldly poſſeſſions: for I thought the moſt abject poverty preferable to ſeeing him la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under ſuch dejection of ſpirits. He left me ſoon after and I, viſionary like, amuſed myſelf with the hope of ſeeing him return (after he had paid his debts of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) a true penitent, and that ſome little might be left from the wreck of his fortune, on which we might live in decent compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence retired from the world, and yet enjoy all the real bleſſings of life.</p>
                     <p>But, alas! ſir, theſe pleaſing, deluſive hopes laſted but a ſhort time. Night ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and Rookſby did not return? Day after day paſſed, and I ſaw him not! I ſent to inquire after him—he was ſtill with his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute

                     <p>The peruſal of this horrid billet threw me into a ſtate of inſenſibility, and when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the power of thinking, it was too late My huſband was ſet off for England.

were the hours of ſickneſs, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vénted my following and even in priſon attending him. The anxiety of mind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded my recovery, and I felt myſelf much hurt and neglected at receiving no tidings from Mr. Rookſby.

I am now under her protection. She has held forth to me the hand of benevolence—though, much I fear, ſhe has ſcarcely the means to ſupport herſelf, as ſhe told me the other day that ſhe muſt leave the houſe ſhe was then in, and diſcharge her ſervants, as her income would afford nothing but the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of life; yet added ſhe, with a ſmile of friendly attention, ſmall as my power is, you ſhall be welcome to ſhare with me the little I have left.</p>

Oh! my dear uncle, let me intreat you to extend your kindneſs towards me.

                     <head>MERIEL, IN CONTINUATION.</head>
                     <p>IT was not long after this letter was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched before Mr. Prevott came and perſonally offered to Harriet an aſylum in his houſe. Their meeting was tender I ſhared her joys as far as my own unhappy ſituation would permit, but cordial as was the offered friendſhip of her uncle I could perceive he felt, ſeverely felt, poor Harriet's diſhonour. I was greatly relieved by her having found ſo able, ſo proper a protector; for indeed, my dear Celia, I was reduced very low, and two days after ſhe left me I removed from the houſe at Pimlico and which we had taken ready furniſhed. I diſcharged my ſervant and would have perſuaded good Deborah to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Wales to her friends, offering to pay her expenſes home. But this was attempting an impoſſibility. She told me I might ſend her from my preſence, but no power ſhould force her from London. She would remain near me, nay, ſhe would ſerve me while ſhe had life. Such a proof of diſintereſted fidelity awakened all my gratitude, and from that moment I took her for my companion, my friend, my adviſer, and we removed together to a ſmall lodging near the King's bench priſon, where poor Rookſby was by this
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:029439_0563_0FE11A778FC99C58"/>
time removed; for his diſtreſſes were ſo complicated and his affairs in ſuch a diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate it was impoſſible to procure his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement. Here it was I firſt began my letter to you, in which I meant to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the whole account of my ſad change, but my dear girl ſickened with the meaſles, and after languiſhing near a month was taken to eternal bliſs. I fear, my beloved Celia, I behaved in a manner unbecoming a Chriſtian, I did not ſubmit as I ought I gave way to deſpair and was puniſhed by the loſs of reaſon, for ſeveral weeks. In this ſituation Kingly once more ſtepped forward to preſerve and reſcue me from the horrors of a mad houſe; for to that dreadful ſtate, or perhaps worſe to that of a poor wandering lunatic deſtitute and forlorn, I might have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced but for his timely interpoſition. He had me removed to his own lodgings, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the beſt Phyſicians, nay, he even extended his benevolence to my unfortunate huſband, whoſe feelings had been ſtrongly awakened by the death of his child. But thoſe feelings were ſoon overcome, and his heart again become calous. When I firſt began to recover my recollection, it was carefully concealed from me where I was. Deborah by degrees informed me of all that had paſſed and told me Kingly requeſted to ſee me. I was too weak in mind and body to reſiſt,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:029439_0564_0FE11A7ADD6C64F8"/>
and for ſome time I was accuſtomed to paſs an hour or two with him every day, I ſaw not the danger, the impropriety of my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till rouſed from my dream of ſecurity by the following circumſtance.</p>
                     <p>I was well enough to leave my apartment for the adjoining room, where I had dined for the firſt time with Kingly, who, as he ſaid, to ſurprize me agreeably had ſent for his dear boys from ſchool, and alſo Clara's two children, whom he has taken under his protection. At the firſt ſight of the children my ſorrows all revived and I gave way to a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent burſt of tears, which relieved the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that ſeemed like a cord to be bound round my heart. I wept plentifully, nor did any one attempt to prevent me. The dear children had all by degrees drawn nearer to me, and the youngeſt boy climbing on my lap, wiped off my tears with his frock, whilſt he kiſſed me and bade me not cry any more. I know not how it was; but the anguiſh of my heart gradually ſubſided. I am not deſtitute of comfort ſaid I mentally; theſe dear children, the friendſhip of Kingly, is ſomething yet! how many at this moment, a thouſand times more deſerving, are more wretched, more forlorn than I am. During dinner theſe reflections occupied my mind. I ſpoke little, but I felt a degree of ſerenity
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:029439_0565_0FE11A806C505470"/>
pervade my breaſt, to which it had long been a ſtranger. When the deſert was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the boys growing rather boiſterous in their play were diſmiſſed to another apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Kingly ſeated himſelf next me. We were for ſome moments ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"I hope," ſaid Kingly, "my dear Mrs. Rookſby, you will now ſoon be able to reap the benefit of freſh air, and go for a ſhort time into the country. It will be of great ſervice to you."</p>
                     <p>"I hope I ſhall," replied I, "ſoon be able to go out; for then I can go to poor Rookſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, for I wiſh to ſee him and learn how he is accommodated; I fear he has been very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable during my illneſs."—"Surely my dear creature," ſaid he, fixing his eyes on my face with a look of expreſſive tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, "ſurely you cannot mean to return to that man."</p>
                     <p>"Why not, Mr. Kingly. He certainly wants a friend and comforter under his preſent uneaſy circumſtances."—</p>
                     <p>"But are not his preſent calamities the fruit of his own folly; and has he not behaved in the baſeſt manner to you? has he not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited all right—</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="83" facs="unknown:029439_0566_0FE11A84DE2B1948"/>
"Not to my duty and attention," ſaid I, eagerly interrupting him, "if he has forgot his duty, it is no rule for me to neglect mine."</p>
                     <p>"But ſhould you leave him, all the world would acquit you."</p>
                     <p>"Yes Kingly; but I muſt be acquitted by a higher, a more ſacred tribunal than the world. I ſeek the approbation of my own conſcience, and the continued protection of a Being; wiſe! as he is great and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful."—</p>
                     <p>"But ſurely, my dear Meriel, as you have done your duty, nothing more can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from you."</p>
                     <p>"Yes Kingly, yes while I live, and Rookſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is in exiſtence I know my marriage vow is in full force; and may I ſoon be able to fulfill the ſacred engagements I entered into."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! Meriel you ſurely love, ſpite of his errors this ungrateful Rookſby."</p>
                     <p>"No—no,—miſtake me not, I mean not to arrogate to myſelf the merit of a virtue to
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:029439_0567_0FE11A89F6C93138"/>
which I have no claim. I pity him from my ſoul, nay would ſacrifice my own peace; to reſtore his tranquillity; but did I love him; Oh! gracious heaven, did I love him, I could not live and retain my reaſon under my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent circumſtances."</p>
                     <p>"Then, why Meriel, why will you ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice your own peace, to a chimerical notion of duty? If you love him not, why return to him: why fly from a man, who not only loves, but almoſt adores you? Then ſtay with me, thou beloved of my ſoul, ſhare my fortune and be the friend of my boſom; Rookſby ſhall enjoy all the comforts, nay if you require it, all the elegancies of life."</p>
                     <p>Shall I tell you, my friend, ſhall I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that ſtrong as was my ſenſe of recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, I felt my reſolution ſlacken. My treacherous heart even debated whether I ſhould not ſtand excuſed, if I accepted his offer.—Oh, God! pardon the weakneſs of frail humanity, if for a moment, I forgot what was due to the Deity I ſerved—the religion I profeſſed. Yes, Celia, I liſtened, I thought myſelf convinced, and had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to leave the man to whom I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed love and obedience to the lateſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of our lives.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="85" facs="unknown:029439_0568_0FE11A8CC648D360"/>
Kingly, though ardent in his wiſhes for me to be ſeperated from my huſband, was reſpectful in his behaviour and we paſſed the evening in a friendly converſation, which would not have called a bluſh on the cheek of a brother and ſiſter. Deborah had during my illneſs always ſlept in my apartment. But a few nights preceding the one I have mentioned, we had prevailed on her to go to another room and ſuffer one of Kingly's ſervants to occupy her place on a mattreſs by my bed-ſide.</p>
                     <p>When I was retired to reſt, when I no longer ſaw the expreſſive countenance, or heard the perſuaſive tongue of Kingly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection returned with double force, and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived I was ſtanding on the brink of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice, from which if I receded not in time, I muſt plunge into everlaſting ruin. Weak as I ſtill was from the effects of my diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I reſolved to fly, while I had ſufficient reaſon left to direct me from the dangerous temptations which ſurrounded me.—Forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, injured by my huſband, and under the immediate protection of the man, who firſt taught my heart to beat with affection, who had conferred on me obligations I could never repay, who ſtill loved:—And, Oh! my dear Celia, (the glow of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:029439_0569_0FE11A92B25D72A8"/>
covers me as I write it,) who ſtill was beloved by me.</p>
                     <p>To deliberate a moment; was to be loſt, another ſuch an interview as the laſt, and I might ruſh on irretrievable deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>The ſervant who ſlept in the room with me, wearied by the employments of the day enjoyed a ſound and undiſturbed repoſe—The clock had ſtruck three, when convinced of the danger of remaining longer under his roof, I reſolved to fly from Kingly. A can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle was always burning in my room: I aroſe with as little noiſe as poſſible, wrapping my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as warm as I could and tying up a change of linen in a handkerchief, I glided ſoftly down ſtairs, and opening the ſtreet door ventured into the ſtreet. I knew there were coaches employed in the night as well as the day, and did not fear but I ſhould ſoon find one to convey me to the houſe where I had lodged, previous to the death of my ever regretted Clementina, and where I knew I ſhould be received and might remain till the hour when I could be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the priſon to my huſband.</p>
                     <p>You will, perhaps, blame me, for leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the protection of Kingly, in ſo abrupt a manner. Perhaps you will ſay why not ſtay
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:029439_0570_0FE11A98505D8F58"/>
till the morning, and then inform him of my reſolution.—Alas! my friend, I dared not ſtay. I was ſenſible of the weakneſs of my heart, and had he intreated! had he looked unhappy! I know it would not have been in my power to perſevere.</p>
                     <p>His lodgings were in Weſtminſter near the park, and I found no ſtand of coaches near. Add to this, my weakneſs and the penetrating keenneſs of the night air, made my head ſwim, and I ſtaggered like a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon intoxicated. I was proceeding as well as I was able toward Weſtminſter bridge, when a cry of thieves and a watchman's rattle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted my attention. I was then near the end of Parliament-ſtreet, and before I had time for a moments thought found myſelf ſurrounded by a number of watchmen, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables and other ſtrange looking people, who one and all, perſiſted that I was an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complice with a gang of thieves, who had, by the aſſiſtance of the houſekeeper, broke in and robbed a lady's houſe in George<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet.</p>
                     <p>I attempted to ſpeak; but had not the power. A cold chillneſs ſeized me, and my limbs failed, though I ſtill retained my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and felt the horrors of my ſituation in their full force!—Imagine, my dear Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:029439_0571_0FE11A9DCFCBEA30"/>
for a moment what my feelings were. I feared my reaſon would again wander: but it pleaſed Heaven to preſerve me from that dreadful calamity. They conveyed me without reſiſtance to the watch-houſe, where they threw me like a beaſt upon the floor, imagining my inanimation to proceed from the effects of liquor. Though unable to ſpeak, I groaned pitiouſly and felt the tears guſh in torrents from my eyes: but ſtill I was unnoticed by all, except a young creature who I am ſure could not have counted above ſixteen years, and who habited in a white bedgown, a tattered ſilk petticoat, and a pair of old ſattin ſhoes that would ſcarcely ſave her feet from the ground, ſat in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the place near where they had thrown me down; and as I then verily believed, where I was to end my days. For the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſhock that had deprived me of the power of ſpeech and motion ſeemed like the ſtroke of death, and I lifted up my ſoul to that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er who I thought was calling me to himſelf from a world, where from a child, I had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced little elſe but ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>The poor girl, whom I heard them call Peggy, knelt down beſide me raiſed my head on her knee and put a ſmall glaſs of warm punch to my mouth, which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable had juſt given her.—"Let her alone
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:029439_0572_0FE11AA229623530"/>
Peggy, ſaid he, ſhe has had enough already. She is ſo drunk ſhe can neither ſpeak nor ſtand.—</p>
                     <p>"Poor ſoul," cried Peggy, in an accent of the ſofteſt compaſſion. "She is ill I can ſee ſhe is, and may die for want of aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Come, continued ſhe, ſwallow a drop of this. It may revive you."</p>
                     <p>Celia, the love of life is ſo ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on human nature, that though bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beneath the weight of almoſt inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able afflictions we ſtruggle ſtill to preſerve exiſtence. I ſwallowed the offered refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Peggy chaffed my hands and laid my head upon her boſom; my ſpirits revived, my ſtrength began to return and in leſs than half an hour I could articulate my thanks to my preſerver. Till tea the enſuing morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I remained in this miſerable place, nor was I even able to procure the leaſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation for myſelf or companion in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; for they had not only taken my bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle from me but even rifled my pockets of a guinea and a half, which was all that I poſſeſſed in the world. At ten o'clock a coach was called and with ſeveral others I was carried to a juſtice's for examination; for it was alledged that I was the woman, who had opened the door to the thieves and
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:029439_0573_0FE11AA7458CF5A0"/>
that having got what booty I could myſelf, I was making off when they ſtopped me; in evidence of which they produced my little bundle which contained two ſhifts a petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat two muſlin handkerchiefs and a linen gown. The conſtable alſo ſwore that I had more property about me; but that I had thrown it away when they purſued me and they could find nothing but a gold watch chain which they had picked up, and which they immediately produced wrapped in a fine cambrick handkerchief. Judge my ſurprize, Celia, when on opening the handkerchief I ſaw my own watch chain, to which was fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a miniature of my departed child ſet round with pearls, and on which I had deſired Deborah to raiſe ſome money, I imagine the faithful creature had deceived me and raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the money on ſomething of her own—yet how the chain could be dropped by me was a myſtery, unleſs as I have ſince reaſon to think it was with the gown I had packed up and might drop from the bundle. During my examination, a coach ſtopped at the door and an elderly lady entered. It was the lady, whoſe houſe had been attempted. The moment ſhe ſaw me ſhe pronounced me not guilty.</p>
                     <p>I never ſaw her before, ſaid ſhe, with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible emotion, and even had ſhe lived in my houſe. I could not have ſuſpected her.—</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="unknown:029439_0574_0FE11AAB6B7FF4B0"/>
I cannot, my dear Celia, deſcribe this lady to you ſuch as ſhe appeared to me. There was a mixture of majeſty and condeſcenſion in her manner, her countenance beamed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity, and it appeared a countenance ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered grave by affliction rather than that by nature. Several other perſons were now brought in, who had been apprehended by other watchmen, and from a variety of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences I was acquitted; when I heard thoſe words paſs the juſtice's lips, I was haſtily leaving the place, but a man ſtopped me and told me I could not go till I had paid all fees.—"Indeed ſir," ſaid I, in a voice ſcarcely audible, "I have no money; that watch chain I think was mine, yet how it came here I know not nor dare I demand it. Permit me to go and if ever it is in my power"—"I ſhall do no ſuch thing, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs," ſaid the man, "either pay the fees or ſtay in our cuſtody till you can."</p>
                     <p>I could not anſwer, but raiſing my hands and eyes to heaven was returning in ſilent agony when the lady advanced and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the cauſe of my new diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>"And are theſe your Britiſh laws" ſaid ſhe, "that when a perſon is falſely accuſed and their innocence made perfectly appear, are they to be detained from their families
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:029439_0575_0FE11AB16EBDD200"/>
for the paltry conſideration of a few ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings?" She then put her hand in her pocket and preſented me with two guineas, at the ſame time aſking if ſhe could be of any further ſervice to me; I would have thanked her, but my feelings were too powerful to permit me to ſpeak, ſhe ſaw my gratitude, ſhe perfectly comprehended from my looks more than words would convey.—"You intereſt me," ſaid ſhe, "can you not tell me how I may ſerve you. Oblige me, madam; make me your friend I will not abuſe your confidence; but pardon me, I am to blame. This is no place for converſation. Do me the favour to wait till I have finiſhed the diſagreeable buſineſs that brought me here, and then give me leave to take you to any place you wiſh to go to in my carriage."—I curtſyed my aſſent to this humane propoſal, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Celia, I was unable to walk, and could but ill afford to procure a coach. Harraſſed as my ſpirits had been, my ſtrength was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted and I was almoſt ſinking with faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. When the lady had ended her buſineſs, ſhe deſired me to follow her, juſt as we were ſtepping out of the door, poor Peggy who was juſt releaſed, paſſed us on the ſteps.—"Forgive me, madam," ſaid I, "if I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſhare with this benevolent girl, the bounty of your hand. She did all in her power laſt night for me, I fear I ſhould have
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:029439_0576_0FE11AB5B57A1428"/>
periſhed, but for her humanity."—I then gave her the remainder of the guinea I had changed to pay the fees of the office. "God bleſs you," ſaid ſhe, preſſing the hand that offered her the money, while the tears ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her fine blue eyes. "And was ſhe kind to you?" ſaid the lady. I repeated the circumſtance of the preceding night. "Good girl," ſaid ſhe, "have you any friends?" addreſſing Peggy.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! no Madam," I am a poor, guilty, forlorn creature: loſt to every thing but a ſenſe of my own miſery."</p>
                     <p>"So young, and yet accuſe yourſelf of guilt." "Alas Madam, I was involved in guilt before I knew the value of virtue."</p>
                     <p>The lady anſwered not; but giving her a card, bade her call on her in the afternoon, and ſhe would do ſomething for her.</p>
                     <p>"And now," ſaid ſhe, as ſhe ſeated her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in her carriage, "tell me where you wiſh to go."</p>
                     <p>"To the Kings bench priſon, madam." "To a priſon, good heavens! have you friends there?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="94" facs="unknown:029439_0577_0FE11B1B99BAF1D0"/>
"My huſband, madam, is confined there."</p>
                     <p>"Have you any children?</p>
                     <p>"I had, madam, one, a ſweet girl:—but"—I could not proceed. I turned my face from her, and we both remained ſilent for ſeveral minutes.—</p>
                     <p>"I too," ſaid the lady, ſtarting as it were from a deep reverie. "I too, once had a child—a girl—nay, perhaps have ſtill; but for many! many! years, ſhe has been loſt to me."</p>
                     <p>When we drew near to the end of our little journey, ſhe told me ſhe felt inclined to be my friend, and if I would do her the favour to call at her houſe and point out the means, ſhe would readily exert her utmoſt abilities to alleviate the afflictions, which ſeemed to preſs ſo heavily upon me. She then told me her name was Harcourt and wiſhed me a good morning.</p>
                     <p>Weak, oppreſſed, dejected my trembling limbs being ſcarce able to ſupport me, I ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcended the ſtairs, which led to the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment occupied by Rookſby. The door was opened. I was juſt entering, but a ſight met my eyes that almoſt annihilated me. It was
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:029439_0578_0FE11ABB0C642268"/>
Rookſby ſeated beſide his infamous Clara, with tea and coffee on the table before them. From their own diſhabille and the appearance of the room, I perceived they were but juſt riſen. I know not what I ſaid in the firſt moment of ſurprize, but I remember claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my forehead hard with both my hands and exclaiming, "grant me patience hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven." As I ran down ſtairs, my brain ſeemed whirling in perpetual motion and had I not been detained by one of the keepers of the priſon I fear I ſhould have ruſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtreet in a ſtate little ſhort of inſanity.</p>
                     <p>The recollection of what I then ſuffered is too much for my weak ſpirits. I cannot proceed in my narrative. Adieu, my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Celia, I am now in a place of ſafety and will, when I am able, inform you of every occurrence down to the preſent time. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven bleſs you.</p>

                     <p>I HARDLY dare take up my pen to write to the worthy Onſlow: for I have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered myſelf totally unworty of his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Will you and your amiable Amelia believe it? No you will think it impoſſible, that I—I, who ſo often have ſworn to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect her, ſhould act in ſo thoughtleſs a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as to drive the lovely Meriel from my houſe. Yes, Onſlow, ſhe left my houſe in the night, unattended and ruſhed into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, of which her delicate mind could form no idea; and my folly was the cauſe. I forgot what was due to her honour and my own, and dared to ſolicit her to quit her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and remain with me. Oh! fool, madman that I was, when I knew the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of her mind, to think ſhe would ſuffer ſuch a thought to harbour in her boſom for a moment. She once loved me;—yes, and
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:029439_0580_0FE11AC448A420B0"/>
with a voice ſoft as harmony, yet with looks and manners chaſte as Diana, has ſhe late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſed ſhe ſtill does and ever ſhall love me. But did I not know the heart of Meriel Howard. Was I not ſenſible, that with all her ſexes ſoftneſs ſhe poſſeſſed the firmneſs and intrepidity of a Spartan matron? But I am tormenting you with ſuſpenſe while I am writing an eulogium on her, with whoſe virtues you are already well acquainted.</p>
                     <p>The dear creature had recovered ſo far as to be able to leave her apartment, when the converſation paſſed between <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> which frightened her from the protection I had vainly hoped would have henceforth ſhelter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her from all the ills of life. She had ſupped with me, and on retiring, wiſhed me a good night with a look and voice ſo full of tenderneſs, that I longed to preſs her to my heart: but I forbore and only kiſſed her hand. Early the next morning, I was awakened by poor Deborah, who aſked me if I knew where her lady was—for ſhe was not in her apartment, nor had the ſervant who ſlept in her room ſeen her. Terrified, leaſt her unfortunate malady ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, I haſtily aroſe and inquired of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſon in the houſe if they had ſeen her; but to no purpoſe. The ſtreet door was found unlock'd and on ſearching her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:029439_0581_0FE11AC7B9C2AEA0"/>
her hat and cloak with a few ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries were miſſing. It then ruſhed into my mind that her own ſenſibility and ſtrict ſenſe of rectitude had driven her from my protection. Where could ſhe go? Her friends or rather thoſe who had once ſtiled themelves ſo, had all forſaken her in her misfortunes—to whom then could ſhe go? Diſtracting as the thought was, I concluded ſhe was gone to her baſe treacherous huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Impreſſed with this idea, I went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the priſon; but ſhe had not been there. I did not attempt to ſee Rookſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, I could not have ſpoken to him with calmneſs. I returned home almoſt deprived of reaſon, nor had I any tidings of the dear fugitive, till late in the afternoon, when I received the following note.</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter">

                           <head>MRS. ROOKSBY. to F. KINGLY, <abbr>ESQ.</abbr>

                           <p>YOU are no doubt uneaſy; let this calm your fears, I am ſafe. Reaſon told me I muſt not remain any longer with you. I came to my huſband; but ſomething has occurred, which I cannot now explain, and which makes it impoſſible for me to remain with him. We have parted, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,

forever.—But I charge you, Kingly, endeavour not to find me out,—I wiſh not to ſee you again. It is a meddling world. They have been already too buſy with our names.—Think me not ungrateful for your friendſhip: it will never be obliterated from my mind while I have life; but it is fit, it is proper we ſhould meet no more.—I know my faithful Deborah will wiſh to come to me. Bid her come with the bearer of this, who waits. But oh! Kingly, unleſs you wiſh to add another weight to my already inſupportable afflictions, make no attempt to ſee me.—Heaven bleſs you, forever bleſs you, I cannot expreſs all I wiſh; perhaps did I feel leſs, I could write with more eloquence.—As my laſt requeſt I intreat you not to withdraw your bounty from the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Clara. They are innocent, whatever are the crimes of their parents. Oh Kingly, if you could ſee my heart, you would ſee it bleed with real anguiſh, while I tell you we muſt not cannot meet again. Once more, God bleſs you, and reward you for your kindneſs to the wretched</p>

Though I earneſtly deſired to ſee the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering angel, her commands, her pathetic entreaties to me were ſacred; I ſent for Deborah and giving her ten guineas bade her haſten to her miſtreſs and to let me know when ſhe wanted more caſh. The faithful old woman ſobbed with joy when I told her that her lady was ſafe; and left the room almoſt with the alacrity of a girl, when ſhe was told to follow the meſſenger who brought the letter.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, the money was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſmall parcel, which I received and opened without knowing from whence it came. On the inner paper were theſe words. "Dear generous Kingly, I am already over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with obligations from you. Pardon me, I can receive no more." There was no name annexed; but I knew the dear characters had been traced by the hand of Meriel.—Reſolved, if poſſible, ſtill to ſerve her, even againſt her inclination, I went to my agent and deſired him to go to the bench, make inquiry for Deborah and pretend to pay ſome money that was owing to old Mr. Howard. But here I failed; for when my agent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, he informed me that Mrs. Rookſby had been with her huſband that ſhe remained only a ſhort time and where ſhe was gone no one could tell. He alſo informed me
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:029439_0584_0FE11AD5CBA1FB48"/>
that Rookſby had a woman in the apartment with him, who had been thrown into priſon about three weeks before by a Mercer, to whom ſhe was indebted upwards of a hundred pounds, and that both of them expected ſoon to be releaſed. From his deſcription of the woman's perſon, I ſhould ſuppoſe it to be the infamous Clara; but think it almoſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as I was informed ſhe was living at Bruſſels only a ſhort time ſince in great ſplendor with a man of the firſt rank and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Should it prove ſo, I ſhall pronounce him a blacker villain than I ever thought him: and how like an angel will the villainy of the one and the ingratitude of the other make Meriel appear, who in the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſhe was ſo cruelly treated by them could recommend their children to my care. I will obey her, Onſlow. They ſhall ſhare the education of my own boys, and I make no doubt of being able to provide for them either in the army or navy.—</p>
                     <p>Every inquiry after Meriel is vain She has hid herſelf ſo effectually as to elude the ſtricteſt ſearch, I can no longer ſtay in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land I have ſolicited employment in the Weſt-Indies and ſhall ſoon ſail. I have commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:029439_0585_0FE11ADAA4A875E0"/>
my agent to continue his ſearch for Mrs. Rookſby and ſhould he diſcover the place of her retreat to ſupply her with caſh, without ſuffering her even to ſuſpect from whom it comes. I am certain wherever ſhe is, ſhe is in neceſſity. Good heavens, that I ſhould live to ſay, while I am in poſſeſſion of all the ſuperfluities of life, Meriel Howard, the firſt choice of my heart, the woman I love and revere above all her ſex, is perhaps languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for want of the means to ſupport ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence. I will write no more I am almoſt devoid of reaſon when I think for a moment on the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>I hardly dare deſire my remembrance to your Amelia. I know how ſhe loved and eſteemed Meriel, and I have ſome faint hope that ſhe will hear from the dear ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's own hand how ſhe has diſpoſed of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for certain I am, that while life warms the heart of Meriel Howard, it will glow with grateful affection for Amelia Sidney. And while I live, I ſhall remain your's in friendſhip.</p>

                     <p>I BROKE off abruptly in my laſt, for I found my ſpirits were unequal to the taſk of retracing ſcenes which had given me ſo much uneaſineſs. I informed you of my diſcovery of Clara in the priſon with Rookſby; but I am yet to inform you that when, by the humanity of one of the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I was prevailed on to go into a room and endeavour to compoſe myſelf, I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a verbal meſſage from my cruel tyrant, deſiring me to leave him to his fate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my favourite Kingly, with whom he knew I had publicly lived for ſeveral weeks in defiance of ſhame.

I once more aſcended the ſtairs to his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, and knocking at the door, entered with as much reſolution, as I could aſſume.</p>
                     <p>He received me with a mixture of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and contempt, and Clara, without deigning to riſe from her ſeat; gave a ſlight inclination of the head: but at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I felt myſelf a wife, an innocent injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wife! and reſentment conquered every other feeling!—</p>
                     <p>"Rookſby!" ſaid I, ſeating myſelf op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to him, and regarding him with a fixed attention, "I come to inquire by what action of my life, I have incurred the unjuſt cenſures you have thrown upon me, or in what I have forfeited my claim to your regard, ſince I have been your wife."</p>
                     <p>"By your vile connection with Belger, before you were my wife—and your ſtill more infamous intrigue with Kingly ſince!" ſaid he, in a kind of hurried accent, as though conſcious he did not himſelf believe what he aſſerted.</p>
                     <p>"By all my hopes of future felicity, Rookſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by," I replied, "I am innocent of what you accuſe me, as was the infant I bore—and who, I truſt, is now an angel in the

                     <p>"Poor Clementina," ſaid he, riſing and coming toward me, I ſhould have liked to have ſeen her once more, before ſhe was gone forever."</p>
                     <p>Clara, ſaw ſhe was loſing ground; ſo riſing in great haſte, ſhe told him that when he had ſettled the difference that had been between us, perhaps, ſhe might look in and congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate us; that content was a great bleſſing, and a forgiving temper, a ſure ſign of a good chriſtian; that for her part, ſhe had good reaſon to ſuppoſe both Mrs. Belger and Mrs. Kingly fell victims to my art, for their hearts were broken by their huſbands, whoſe affections I had exerted myſelf to obtain, and had effectually drawn from them."</p>
                     <p>"If," ſaid I with more firmneſs than I believed myſelf capable of, "if every wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the world was as free from the crime of ſeducing the affection of a huſband from his wife as I am, it would be well for many. But, be not miſtaken, Clara, I come not to ſue to my huſband, or endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain his heart, I am at length convinced I
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:029439_0589_0FE11AEDC33A9D48"/>
never poſſeſſed it, and as it would have been happy for us, had we never met; I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined that we will here part forever!!!"</p>
                     <p>"Forever, Meriel," ſaid Rookſby, "leave me forever?"—</p>
                     <p>Clara's countenance brightened, and ſhe reſumed her ſeat.</p>
                     <p>"I am well convinced, Rookſby," I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "that ſo far from having it in my power to ſerve or oblige you, my preſence is painful to you, and I am conſidered a burthen.—The pain, the burthen ſhall therefore be removed."</p>
                     <p>"And you will return to Kingly?"</p>
                     <p>"No! Rookſby.—Here in the awful face of Heaven, I ſwear, I never have, nor ever will diſhonour the name of your rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mother: a name, which at her requeſt I received from you. And, that Heaven is my witneſs, was the chearful diſcharge of my duty a ſource of happineſs to you, as no power on earth ſhould ſeperate me from you!—I would remain with you in the moſt abject diſtreſs—comfort you—nay, even labour for your ſupport! but—as it is—we muſt part!!!—I forgive
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:029439_0590_0FE11AF341C6A2B8"/>
you from my ſoul, every injury—not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you! but, thoſe who have been the cauſe of your errors!—I will pray for your happineſs—and forget, if poſſible—how cruelly and how often you have wronged me!"—</p>
                     <p>"I am villain!" ſaid he, riſing and ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his forehead with vehemence.</p>
                     <p>"Before we part Rookſby," cried I, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my hand on his arm, " I ſolemnly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you as the laſt and only requeſt I ſhall ever make, ſeek not to palliate your own faults by taxing me with guilt. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of my own innocence, and feel not the ſharpneſs of the accuſation; but it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes your own offences in the ſight of Heaven!—I forgive every thing that has paſt—only, throw not an odium on my character, and I will bleſs you forever!"—</p>
                     <p>"You are, you muſt be innocent," ſaid he, "I believe you are pure as an angel. You are a treaſure too great for me to poſſeſs. I have voluntarily thrown you from me, and though I know your worth, ſome ſtrange fatality ever purſues me, and the weakneſs of my nature hurries me to actions which I know are wrong."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="108" facs="unknown:029439_0591_0FE11AF7276192D0"/>
"Farewel!" ſaid I, turning to leave the room.</p>
                     <p>"But whither are you going, Meriel, I fear you are in want. My affairs begin to wear a better aſpect. I have had a few thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands left me by a relation. Let me know where to ſend to you that you may ſhare in my fortune, though I can never hope again to poſſeſs a place in your heart.—His voice faultered and he actually ſhed tears. Celia, Rookſby is a man ſo weak ſo unſtable in his nature that the impulſe of the moment ever hurries him away: and perhaps juſt then he would have ſued for a reconciliation and had he been maſter of the world offered to divide it with me. And the firſt moment Clara had an opportunity to exert her art, ſhe would have revived all his ſuſpicions and I ſhould again been ill treated, vilified, nay, perhaps thruſt like an abandoned wretch from his houſe.</p>
                     <p>Senſible of this verſatility of temper I wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to prolong our interview, beſides I was faint and exhauſted. The ſpirits which reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had rouſed were now begining to ſubſide and when I conſidered his errors and the weakneſs of his nature I only conſidered him as an object of compaſſion. The preſence of Clara too was inſupportably painful, I,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:029439_0592_0FE11AFC8E7B0FD0"/>
therefore, almoſt forcibly tore myſelf from him and hurring down ſtairs immediately left the priſon, and went to the lodgings I had occupied before.</p>
                     <p>The woman of the houſe received me kindly. After I had taken ſome refreſhment I lay down and endeavoured to procure a little reſt; but the effort was ineffectual.—The ſcenes I had been engaged in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding night and day entirely occupied my thoughts; the idea of Kingly's ſurprize and uneaſineſs when he ſhould diſcover my hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left him; the ſorrow of my affectionate Deborah, my own forlorn ſituation, and dreary future proſpect, all conſpired to baniſh from my eyes the balmy comfort of ſleep. I aroſe, and procuring pens and paper, wrote a few lines to my huſband informing him where I was, that he might not ſay I had prevented his aſſiſting me by not letting him know where to ſend. I alſo wrote to Kingly in a manner which I knew would effectually prevent his endeavouring to ſee me; but deſired him to ſend Deborah back with the perſon, who brought the letter.</p>
                     <p>I paſſed the night in a very reſtleſs man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and in the morning was unable to riſe. A fever, want of appetite, and great laſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, hung upon me for above ten days.—
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:029439_0593_0FE11AFFD09E3A08"/>
Indeed, I thought I was going into a rapid dicline; but the care of Deborah, who nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me with inceſſant tenderneſs, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even with ſome of her apparel to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure me proper and nouriſhing food, reſtored me to ſome degree of my wonted ſtrength. During this time, I heard nothing from Rookſby: though perfectly ſatisfied, that his fickle diſpoſition had operated as uſual, and that no longer ſeen, I was no longer remembered, yet ſomething prompted me to ſend to the bench and inquire after him. Deborah was my meſſenger; ſhe returned and told me he had been releaſed above a week. I then ſent to Le Sage; but without letting him ſuſpect who made the inquiry, and learned that my huſband, (Oh, Heavens! happy had I been, had he never borne that title!) had left England in company with Clara; for I particularly deſired the perſon who inquired, to aſk, wherever he was, if he was alone.</p>
                     <p>It was now time to think of ſome means of ſupport, Gratitude alſo required that I ſhould call on the benevolent Mrs. Harcourt. I dreſſed myſelf as neat as the ſcanty ſtate of my wardrobe would allow and repaired to her houſe. At my approach, I ſaw the ſhutters of the upper part were cloſed; my heart ſunk; but yet I ventured to knock
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:029439_0594_0FE11B05850994D0"/>
at the door. A woman ſervant opened it. I inquired for Mrs. Harcourt. "She is at "Bath," replied the woman. "Has ſhe been ill then?"—"Yes, ſhe caught cold on the night her houſe was robbed, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the fright, brought on the gout in her ſtomach. She was taken ill the next evening and for ſeveral days was thought in great danger; but ſhe is now better, and yeſterday morning ſet off for Bath."</p>
                     <p>I thanked the woman for her information and was going from the door, when who ſhould I ſee croſs the hall but Peggy. She ſaw and inſtantly recollected me: an exclamation of joy and ſurprize eſcaped her and ſhe ran to the door to ſpeak to me. She informed me that Mrs. Harcourt had taken her into the houſe as an aſſiſtant to the houſekeeper that the kind lady had mentioned me previous to her departure, and deſired if I called I would leave word where I might be found. I told Peggy I was not ſettled in any place at preſent; but I would call again in the courſe of a fortnight when I hoped to hear of Mrs Harcourt's perfect recovery.</p>
                     <p>On my return, I conſulted with Deborah, what we could poſſibly do to earn a ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The affectionate creature could think of nothing. She could only weep that I was
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:029439_0595_0FE11B0880173568"/>
obliged to have recourſe to work. After re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving many various ſchemes in my mind, I at length fixed on one, that I thought was feaſible—It was to ſend Deborah to the woman, who had formerly ſupplied me with millinery, and to deſire her to inquire in my name whether ſhe could give employment to a reputable young woman, who was in an ill ſtate of health and only able to work at her own apartment. Deborah executed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion faithfully and on her return told me ſhe had procured employment for me at a great warehouſe, where ſhe had been recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the perſon to whom I ſent her.</p>
                     <p>"But dear madam," ſaid ſhe, the prices are ſo very ſmall, you will never be able to live on what you earn."—This did not deter me. I removed to a room near the warehouſe for which I was to work; that our time might not be taken up in going backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Deborah procured the work and I executed it. I gave great ſatisfaction and had as much as myſelf and Deborah could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly do, yet with the moſt indefatigable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, we could ſcarcely earn eighteen or twenty ſhillings a week. The cloſe applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my employment did not agree with my health, and I was obliged to devote an hour every day to exerciſe, nor did even this anſwer the deſired end, and I was in a ſhort
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:029439_0596_0FE11B0E09343F38"/>
time ſo pale and thin that you would ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have believed me to have been the Meriel Howard you once knew. Ill as I was, I ſtill continued my employment as well as I was able; but weakneſs and fatigue often over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came me and I was obliged to give up hours to reſt, and ſometimes whole days</p>
                     <p>My weakneſs encreaſed, and my income proportionally decreaſed. I ſaw famine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing with haſty ſtrides, and to add to my affliction I knew the affection of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah had involved her in my diſtreſſes. My lodging was in Oxford-ſtreet, and I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times walked into the fields which are adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to the pariſh of Bloomſbury. One day, as with ſlow uneven pace I took my accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed walk, juſt as I had reached Gower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, I ſaw a ſplendid equipage paſs me and ſtop at a houſe which ſeemed newly fitted up. I cannot accouut for the curioſity that ſeized me; but I inquired of a man who had the appearance of a Butler; to whom the houſe and carriage belonged.</p>
                     <p>"To Mr. Howard" ſaid the man—Mr. Howard; what Howard?</p>
                     <p>"I don't know," he replied, "what his Chriſtian name is, but he is lately returned from India".—</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="114" facs="unknown:029439_0597_0FE11B11BB65A488"/>
Aſtoniſhment rendered me ſilent, and the man proceeded.—</p>
                     <p>"He came over about two months ſince, and took that houſe. I then lived the next door and knew all that paſſed in the family. He brought a young lady over with him, who is very pretty; but ſeems unhappy. She is very young indeed; and he is going to marry her; but I think it is againſt her inclination: for though I have heard the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſay ſhe ſeemed to reſpect him, ſhe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten declares ſhe can never love him.—</p>
                     <p>I muſed upon what the man had told me and was determined to inquire farther about this Mr. Howard. It might be my brother, and the ſums I had advanced it might now be in his power to return; not that I intended to aſk him for them but, methought, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection would certainly operate in his boſom in behalf of a ſiſter who had ſhared all her property with him and was now bent to the earth with ſickneſs and ſorrow.—On farther inquiry I learned that his name was Richard Howard. Determined to make at leaſt a trial of him, I learned at what hour it would be moſt likely to ſee him, for as he was become a great man, I readily conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my only being his ſiſter and in diſtreſs would but poorly plead my excuſe for going
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:029439_0598_0FE11B16D84F9260"/>
at an unſeaſonable time. Far be it from me, my dear Celia, to ſay this is the caſe with all, there are ſome glorious ornaments of the creation who never turn from the cry of affliction, and who never conſider it intruſive; whoſe hearts are ever open and whoſe hands are ever ready to diſpenſe to thoſe who are in want, a part of thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which a bounteous Providence has ſhowerd on themſelves:—but the thorough knowledge I have of the human heart led me to reflect, that when a perſon has unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly riſen to opulence from obſcurity, his feelings grow callous he forgets and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally neglects thoſe branches of his family who, though perhaps they have been equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly induſtrious with himſelf, have not been equally the favourites of fortune.</p>
                     <p>At ten o'clock one morning, I knocked at Mr. Howard's door; and was requeſted by the ſervant to ſend up my name, I did ſo, adding that I had particular buſineſs with him. After waiting about ten minutes (for I ſuppoſe my dreſs had not prepoſſeſſed the man in my favour.) I was told I might come up.—My limbs trembled as I entered the room. The firſt glance convinced me it was my brother, though he is greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in bulk, being now a very ſtout man, and when we parted he was but a ſlender
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:029439_0599_0FE108554729B998"/>
lad, yet his features were the ſame. He was ſitting at breakfaſt with a very young lady, who appeared dejected and unhappy. I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined this to be the perſon of whom the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſpoke.</p>
                     <p>He gave a ſlight inclination of the head as I entered, the ſervant brought forward a chair and left the room.</p>
                     <p>"Now madam," ſaid the haughty maſter of the houſe, "what is your pleaſure?"</p>
                     <p>"Is it poſſible," ſaid I, looking earneſtly at him, "that you can have no recollection of me?—</p>
                     <p>"Not the leaſt, I do not recollect that I ever ſaw you before."</p>
                     <p>"You had once a ſiſter, ſir.—</p>
                     <p>"Yes I had, but ſhe was always a ſtrange eccentric girl; ſhe ran through a very good fortune, and I underſtand has diſgraced her family in the moſt ſhocking maner."</p>
                     <p>"Brother," ſaid I, emphatically, "and I felt my eyes guſh out with tears.—</p>
                     <p>He ſat down the cup, which he was raiſing to his lips, and with a look of mingled anger
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:029439_0600_0FE11B20C1EF0690"/>
and aſtoniſhment, cried, "why ſurely you can never be Meriel Howard."—</p>
                     <p>"I am your ſiſter, I am all that remains of Meriel Howard, but I no longer bear that name."—</p>
                     <p>"I was told you had aſſumed the name of a gentleman with whom you lived ſome years, but he has left you through your own folly."—</p>
                     <p>"And who could aſſert ſuch a falſehood, brother?"—</p>
                     <p>"My Aunt Moſſop told me, and ſo did Heſter, who is well married. Suſan wrote them word that you behaved in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſome few years ſince upon the continent, as occaſioned the perſon you lived with to fight a duel on your account: that you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated then and had never lived together ſince."</p>
                     <p>The ſlight, the cutting indifference of my brother, wounded me to the ſoul. I was debilitated in mind and body, yet I could hardly reſtrain the fulneſs of my heart; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable to ſupport the interview any longer, I aroſe to depart; for he had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſked me to eat or drink. The young
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:029439_0601_0FE11B247114D990"/>
lady looked at me, and I ſaw the tear of compaſſion ſtart in her eyes.</p>
                     <p>"I am very ſorry, Meriel," ſaid my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, "that you are in ſuch indifferent circumſtances as your appearance ſeems to beſpeak, if a couple of guineas"</p>
                     <p>"No, ſir!" ſaid I, putting back the hand extended with the money, if I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be received as your ſiſter, I am unworthy of your aſſiſtance: beſides, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I came in hopes to find an affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate relative, a friend, whoſe heart would compaſſionate my ſufferings. Diſappointed in that—I am too proud to accept a dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from your bounty!"—"As you pleaſe, madam!" bowing coldly, "had you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted yourſelf in a manner becoming my ſiſter"—</p>
                     <p>"Brother, had I come to your door in a ſplendid equipage, perhaps, you would not have inquired ſo ſtrictly into my conduct. In that caſe even the errors of which I am now accuſed, would have been overlooked; but poverty is a fault the opulent can ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom pardon. I am happy, brother, to ſee the advancement of your fortune; but, ſhould you ever experience a reverſe, you will then diſcover, that thoſe who now ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:029439_0602_0FE11B2A584D5810"/>
and flatter you, nay, even would creep into your favour by vilifying me, would be the firſt to turn from you; and blame you for misfortunes you could neither avoid nor avert!"</p>
                     <p>"I ſee Meriel," ſaid he, "with a ſneer, "you at leaſt retain one ſtriking trait in your character, you are as good a preacher as ever."</p>
                     <p>"I will take care to retain every trait," I replied, "for which I have been reſpected. I have now loſt the name of Howard, and can no longer diſgrace it by my poverty; and I hope my affluent brother will never let that name be diſhonoured by him."</p>
                     <p>I then bade him good morning, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being requeſted to renew my viſit. I was now ſo accuſtomed to diſappointment that I felt not this behaviour of my brother ſo ſeverely as I ſhould have done ſome few years ſince. Indeed, my dear friend, I think my heart grows hard and inſenſible, and ſeems turning into ſtone, for it is cold and inanimate. I can no longer exult in the happineſs, or ſympathize in the miſeries of my fellow creatures. The world appears one univerſal blank, nay even when I think of you and my Amelia, it ſtill beats but lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guidly,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:029439_0603_0FE11B2E467FD950"/>
its emotions are no longer exquiſitely pleaſant or painful, but like the faint rays of an expiring taper now and then emits a flaſh of light that for a moment chears the gloom of a ſolitary apartment, and after a few ſtruggles is entirely extinguiſhed. So my heart, which feels a degree of kindly warmth play round it, when I think of your affection, will perhaps a little longer ſtruggle to illumine this frail tenement; then ſink to peace in the dark manſion of the grave.—But why ſhould I infeſt you with my melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly? I fear I am an ungrateful wretch; for I have found a friend when I leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it, and one who exerts his power to preſerve a life that is no longer of value to me; becauſe it is entirely uſeleſs to ſociety. My poor Deborah too, ſhe is ſtill faithful and affectionate. I have ſtill much to be thankful for; but ſuch is the frailty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, we remember our ſorrows with a repining mind, while we forget the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of which we we are unworthy parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</p>
                     <p>I have written this at various opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties when my time and ſtrength would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. I ſhall now diſpatch it, as you are I am ſure ever anxious to hear from me, I will write again ſoon, and believe, till my heart
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:029439_0604_0FE11B342E476D68"/>
is devoid of all ſenſation, it will ever love you and pray for your happineſs.</p>

                     <p>MY dear friend, I have once more ſet down to addreſs to you, to tell you I every day draw nearer and nearer the goal, to which we are all haſtening, where I ſhall again embrace my dear Clementina, and be parted from her no more!—I told you, in my laſt, that I had unexpectedly found a friend, who had uſed his utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:029439_0605_0FE11B37C6766370"/>
to ſerve me. It was Mr. Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the gentleman to whoſe care, my regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted benefactor, Mr. Weldon, ſo ſtrenuouſly recommended me before he left England. I was one morning at the warehouſe, from whence I had employment, when he came in and with him a woman extremely gay in her appearance; but many years younger than himſelf. She was what might by many have been called pretty; but to me there appeared nothing in her features that could deſerve that name. It was an unmeaning countenance, devoid of ſenſibility, and if it had any character, it was that of pride and impetuoſity.</p>
                     <p>She purchaſed ſome very expenſive arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, for which he ſtopped to pay, and ſhe went off in the chariot, to make, as ſhe ſaid, ſome morning viſits. From what I ſaw, I feared the good old gentleman had entered the matrimonial pale with a perſon no ways qualified to make him happy; and the event proved I was not miſtaken in my conjectures. As I was ſo greatly altered in perſon, as not to be recollected by a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I could not ſuppoſe Mr. Friendly would know me; but I was miſtaken; for as I was ſpeaking to the perſon who was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me out my work, he turned round haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:029439_0606_0FE11B3CE60110A0"/>
and looked at me as though endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to recollect my features.</p>
                     <p>"There are but ſmall remains of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon," ſaid he, coming toward me, "but I could almoſt ſwear that was the voice of Miſs Howard." You know, Celia, I have often been remarked for the ſoftneſs of my voice, and I believe many, who would not otherwiſe recollect me, know me the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I ſpeak. I curtſyed, acknowledged he was right, and left the ſhop. I had not proceeded many paces before he overtook me, and offering me his arm, with the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude of a father, inquired into my cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. He had heard I was well mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, but nothing more; my preſent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance did not confirm the report; he wiſhed to know if he could ſerve me. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could ſatisfy his laudable curioſity, we had reached the door of the houſe where I lived.</p>
                     <p>"I have an hour to ſpare, ſaid he, "may I be admitted, "I cannot leave you till I know how you are ſituated. I am perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with the goodneſs of your heart; but I know with all your virtues, you have weakneſſes more prejudicial to your intereſt and happineſs than ſome which are called vices. You are credulous; and
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:029439_0607_0FE11B41CDF935A0"/>
you let a ſenſe of duty ſometimes hurry you to actions which are not ſtrictly right. Let me know how you are ſituated; tell me yourſelf what has ſeperated you from your huſband."</p>
                     <p>Shall I confeſs, my dear Celia, ſhame at the mean apartment I occupied, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment crimſoned my cheek; and made me heſitate to admit him up ſtairs; but grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for the kind ſolicitude he expreſſed, a reverential remembrance of the noble ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Weldon, whoſe friend he was: conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to conquer this unſeaſonable emotion of pride, and I led the way to my little garret, (for ſuch it literally is.) Deborah looked ſurpriſed at my introducing a man into an apartment, which conſtituted our dining room, drawing room, bed chamber, and kitchen. But when ſhe heard me mention Mr. Weldon, whoſe name ſhe knew I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, and whoſe friends I ſhould ever conſider as mine, ſhe was perfectly ſatisfied; and when ſhe found the good old gentleman meant to prove his friendſhip to Weldon, by his attention to me, I thought ſhe would have gone wild with joy. She drew a chair cloſe to his, nor could all my endeavours to the contrary, prevent her informing him of all ſhe knew, concerning Rookſby; and when ſhe mentioned my drawing my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:029439_0608_0FE11B46ECFB2EB8"/>
from labour, and my evident ill ſtate of health; ſhe took his hand and preſſed it to her heart; while the tears rolled in big drops down her aged face. I could not ſee her emotions unmoved: I aroſe from my ſeat and pretended to look after the dinner, which Deborah, from her friendly anxiety to promote my intereſt, had totally neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and unſeen, gave a looſe to ſenſations which almoſt overpowered me.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Friendly would not leave me, till he had prevailed with me to give up my em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, to leave the place I then inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and go to apartments, which he would provide a little way out of town.—"You ſhall not be obliged," ſaid he, "for I know that is what would moſt afflict your proud ſpirit. You think you are humble," (added he with a ſmile) "but I know you better. You ever was and ever will be very proud: but I like you the better for it. It is the right ſort of pride; it is a pride, which ſhrinks from the weight of obligation which it has not power to return.—Now to obviate that, you have it in your power to oblige me. I have taken a young creature under my protection, (for I am quite a knight er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the cauſe of the ladies,) ſhe is, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, a girl of good fortune, and ſtrictly virtuous, but very unfortunate. Now if
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:029439_0609_0FE11B4B8C2B7E68"/>
you will take her for your companion and teach her, as I know you poſſeſs abilities, how to amuſe at once her time and enrich her mind, I will ſupply you with the means. Some other time you may learn how I came to take her under my care. Perhaps, ſhe herſelf, when ſhe perceives the gentleneſs of your nature, will confide more to you, than from the difference of our ſex ſhe poſſibly could to me.</p>
                     <p>As to the means of your ſupport, I have ſome connections, in the iſland of St. John's in America, who ſend to me for thick cloaks, &amp;c. fit for the climate; now it ſtrikes me that you might make thoſe garments, at a good profit for yourſelf, and yet leave a ſufficient for me."</p>
                     <p>When I ſound, he did not wiſh me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive obligations from him, without ſome means to repay them, I was willing to liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to his plan, and in leſs than ten days from the time I firſt ſaw him, I was remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to apartments in Iſlington, where he ſent the young lady to me, whom he had taken under his protection. It was evening when ſhe arrived; I was ill, I was fatigued—had retired to bed and ſaw her not till the next morning. Oh! Celia, I am very ill now—my head is giddy—I can proceed no farther
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:029439_0610_0FE11B50A2D49C58"/>
—perhaps I may never reſume the pen.—Let me tell you then, while I have power. This lovely girl is—I can no more—all is dark—and—</p>
                     <p>It was only a faintneſs. I am very ſubject to them lately,—I am ſomething better to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and will, while Deborah permits me, purſue my narrative.</p>
                     <p>The young lady intruſted to my care is the perſon whom I ſaw at my brother's; and who, to avoid an union with him, has left his protection for that of a ſtranger's. She tells me her name is Alton: that ſhe was born in England, but went over to India whilſt an infant; that her mother being obliged to go with a lady up into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Struck with her perſon and the more powerful charms of twenty thouſand pounds, he has left no means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tried,

by which he could hope to win her affection and draw her into a marriage; but ſhe has ever regarded him, as ſhe ſays, with more horror than any other ſenſations, when ſhe has conſidered him as a man deſigned to be her huſband. He was extremely kind and attentive to her, and in return, ſhe reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected him and would do any thing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his happineſs, except ſacrifice her own. She knew ſo little of the world, that ſhe had actually formed a ſcheme of working for her bread, and did not even think ſhe could oblige my brother to do her juſtice or place her at a proper ſchool, and pay the ſum her guardian allowed both for her education and pocket.

                     <p>SINCE my lady diſpatched her laſt letter to you, ſhe has been daily declining and the faintings ſhe mentioned encreaſed in a moſt alarming manner. Mr. Friendly did every thing in his power to make her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and the young lady he placed with her was very affectionate and tender; at one time I was in hopes ſhe would recover. But a circumſtance happened, that affected her ſpirits ſo much as to make the phyſicians think it neceſſary to hurry her to this place for the benefit of the waters. Mr. Friendly generally called on her about twice a week, and though to prevail on my dear lady, to accept aſſiſtance from him, he frequently talked and conſulted her about work; yet
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:029439_0613_0FE11B5E668ADA10"/>
he never ſent any to do, always making ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſe about its not being ready. He was, however, fond of talking to her and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he would bring the newſpaper and read to her, and whenever he gave her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſaid it was for the board of Miſs Alton. It was one afternoon about ſix weeks ago, as he ſat at tea with the two ladies, a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot ſtopped at the door, a very fine lady came out of it, and without any ceremony threw open the dining room door, where they were all ſitting: and flying at my dear lady abuſed her in the groſſeſt manner, accuſed her of being kept by her huſband; for I preſently found, madam, that this dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſionate lady was Mrs. Friendly, who had traced her huſband to the place where he ſo often viſited, and finding only two women there, ſhe immediately thought one of them muſt be her huſband's miſtreſs, and though my poor dear lady was ſo ill as might, one would have thought, prevented any ſuch ſuſpicion from being believed, yet did ſhe inſiſt upon it. Mr. Friendly, ſhe ſaid could maintain her there for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. She called her every vile name, broke the china and was only withheld by her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band from ſtriking the innocent object of her jealouſy, who ſat as it were ſtupified with terror, her hands were claſped and reſted on her knees and her eyes were fixed on the
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:029439_0614_0FE11B63AA6D2908"/>
floor; but ſhe ſpoke not one word. Mr. Friendly endeavoured to prevail on his wife to go home; but ſhe was deaf to his entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, till he promiſed to accompany her. Juſt as ſhe was going out, ſhe turned round and wiſhed my lady might ſtarve and die in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if ever ſhe encouraged her huſband to come there again. "I ſhould like to ſee it," ſaid ſhe, "and if I ſaw you dying, I would not give you a farthing to ſave you. You have had enough from my poor, credulous, fooliſh huſband already and I hope the next bit of bread you eat that is bought with his money will choak you."</p>
                     <p>I do ſuppoſe, madam, ſhe would have gone on much longer, if her huſband had not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt forced her into the carriage, which drove inſtantly away. When they were gone, my dear lady raiſed her eyes and claſped hands to Heaven, "for what new trials am I reſerved!" ſaid ſhe, "Poor Miſs Alton was crying ready to break her heart, and I ſhould have been very glad to ſee my poor miſtreſs do the ſame: but ſhe did not ſhed a ſingle tear. She looked the very pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of uncomplaining ſorrow. I was fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to ſee her look ſo compoſed, and as I feared, her faintings which had kept off for a few days before, now returned with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble violence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="132" facs="unknown:029439_0615_0FE11B67241899C0"/>
The next day, a gentleman came from Mr. Friendly, ſaying, that for family rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, he could not viſit her; but deſired ſhe might want for nothing. This gentleman waited, till the Doctor viſited my lady, and when he heard his opinion, that Briſtol might be of ſervice to her, he deſired me to make inſtant preparations for the journey. I chearfully complied, as I found not only the people, who kept the houſe, where we lodged, but even the neighbours, had learned ſomething of the viſit of Mrs. Friendly, and both my lady and Miſs Alton were conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as bad women.</p>
                     <p>We travelled here by eaſy ſtages, my lady was greatly fatigued, and for many days I did not expect her to live. The place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived in her mind the loſs of her God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, who died here about ſixteen years ago, when my lady firſt left the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. The phyſicians here, comfort me, by ſaying, they do not think ſhe is in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed conſumption; but that her diſorder is chiefly on her ſpirits, and could that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion under which ſhe evidently labours be removed, ſhe might yet recover, and would undoubtedly, in a rapid manner. Though I fear, madam, ſhe will never loſe that depreſſion; yet I cannot but flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſomething may yet turn out to comfort
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:029439_0616_0FE11B6CE546E860"/>
her. Surely it were a great pity ſo good a lady ſhould be cut off in the very flower of her age, and that ſhe, who never wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave pain to any perſon, ſhould be dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a broken heart. Indeed, madam it almoſt breaks my old heart to think of it.</p>
                     <p>She is ſome days ſo well, as to be able to walk to the pump room; but ſhe has her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no idea, that ſhe ſhall ever leave this place. She is perfectly reſigned. She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to write to you and to tell you, ſhe thinks ſhe ſhall never be able to write her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf again. She offers you every kind wiſh and bids you pray for her everlaſting peace. Thoſe are her own words. One thing I was deſired not to mention; but I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude without doing it. I have written twice to Mr. Friendly, ſince we have been here: but received no anſwer. Our money is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt gone, and ſhould he forſake us, what will become of my dear lady and poor Miſs Alton, God knows; as for myſelf, I am old, and could not hope to live much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but for them, they have but juſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the world as it were. Pardon me, madam, for writing ſo much; but I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uneaſy and have no one to complain to or adviſe with. My lady ſaid to me yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, "Deborah, I think I am better: we will diſmiſs the phyſician to-morrow." Poor
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:029439_0617_0FE11B726E494610"/>
lady, I knew her motive: ſhe thinks her money will not laſt long, and that ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not afford to pay him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I wiſh to Heaven, Mrs. Onſlow was in England or Mr. King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Oh! madam that my dear bleſſed lady had been the wife of ſuch a man as Mr. Kingly, how happy would ſhe have been; and ſhe might have lived years and years, bleſſing and bleſſed by all. But now ſhe is broken hearted, forſaken by the world and with all her virtues will die unpitied and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamented by all, except a few, who know how good ſhe is; and among which, none will grieve with more ſincerity than her and your humble friend and ſervant,</p>

                     <p>STRANGE and inſcrutable are the ways of Heaven. Once more, my dear Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, I am permitted to addreſs you, and I have a tale of wonder to unfold, which even at this moment, though I am ſenſible that I live, I breathe, that all around me is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, yet, my aſtoniſhed ſenſes can hardly credit!—Celia, the heavieſt afflictions may lead to the moſt deſirable events. We ought not to complain: every trial, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver painful to be borne is inflicted for ſome wiſe purpoſe. Gracious Heaven! when I think, how I have nouriſhed one ſecret ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; how even in my happieſt moments have I brooded over it? but it is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. That horror, that inexpreſſible horror, which for ſo many years has laid upon my mind, is no more. I have been afflicted 'tis true: but I truſt I am now ſafe at leaſt from poverty. My health daily returns,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:029439_0619_0FE11B7B8FDDEB90"/>
and I can enjoy the heart-felt pleaſure of relieving the diſtreſſed. But how, you will ſay, how have theſe changes taken place? My dear friend, when the tumult of my heart will permit me, I will tell you that I am no longer the friendleſs, diſtreſſed crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I was not long ſince. I have a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther living! I have a father too! Bleſſed! bleſſed words! and thoſe whom I ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as my parents were only relations. Mrs. Howard was ſiſter to my mother.—But let me tell my tale with ſome coherence: for I think my Celia will imagine me wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering from reaſon, and that I am writing her the effuſions of a diſtempered fancy.</p>
                     <p>While I was at Briſtol, as long as I was able, I went every morning to the pump room. Miſs Alton always accompanied me. I there had ſeveral times an opportunity of ſeeing and converſing with Mrs. Harcourt, who was detained there by the ill ſtate of her huſband's health, who I found was at Bath at the time I firſt ſaw her, which was the occcaſion of her attending the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the perſons ſuſpected of robbing her houſe. She frequently made me offers of friendſhip, at the ſame time entreating my confidence: but my ſpirits were not at that time, in a ſtate to permit me to relate the incidents of my life, moſt of which had
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:029439_0620_0FE11B80AB0755C8"/>
been ſo extremely painful, that I endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as much as was in my power to baniſh them from my memory.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Friendly, from family reaſons, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine was deterred from inquiring for me, after I left London, and the allowance he had made me on account of Miſs Alton's being with me, till he could hear from her friends abroad, entirely ceaſed when we had been about a month in Briſtol, ſo that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came again in very neceſſitous circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which added to my having declined the attendance of the phyſician, and omitted going to drink the waters, on account of my ſlender finances, encreaſed my diſorder and I ſoon was confined to my bed. Miſs Alton is a tender and affectionate girl and would have confined herſelf to my bedſide, had I not inſiſted, that ſhe ſhould ſometimes walk out. In one of theſe walks ſhe met Mrs. Harcourt, who inquired after me.—The friendly girl expecting every hour to loſe me, burſt into tears at the queſtion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed my ſituation to Mrs. Harcourt and entreated her to come and ſee me. Her own humanity impelled her to comply, and that very afternoon ſhe came to my apartment. She ſeated herſelf by my bedſide, took my hand, and was beginning to ſpeak; when Deborah entered the room with ſome toaſt
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:029439_0621_0FE11B8554624EB8"/>
and water which ſhe had been down ſtairs to procure. Mrs. Harcourt ſtarted. The glaſs fell from Deborah's hand; for their eyes met in the ſame moment. "Good gracious!" ſaid Deborah, "am I awake—are you!—no,—it can't be!—I thought—but 'tis impoſſible!"</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Harcourt had a little recovered her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. "Yes, Deborah, ſaid ſhe, "it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I am alive ſtill, though ſo many years thought dead.—But tell me—I almoſt fear to aſk—yet tell me, where is my child?</p>
                     <p>Deborah came near. She took my hand and put it into Mrs. Harcourt's, preſſed them together, but remained ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! gracious heaven!" ſhe exclaimed, "and is it indeed ſo?" Then falling on the bed, and throwing her arms round me, ſhe cried, "my child! My darling child! have I found you then, only to loſe you?"—Full of aſtoniſhment and wonder, I could ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſk the meaning of what I heard and ſaw. "How madam," ſaid I, "can I be your child? Alas! my dear mother has been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years in the ſilent grave."—"You have heard her mention a ſiſter ſhe once had?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="139" facs="unknown:029439_0622_0FE11B8A86ADA3F8"/>
"Yes, but I always underſtood ſhe was dead before I was born."—"Dead to the world I was," ſhe replied, "for many years, and from a few weeks after your birth, my ſiſter never heard from me. Many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes have I experienced, far from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, unable to hear from you, and above ten years in captivity. When I again ſaw my native land and made inquiry for my child and ſiſter, I was told they were both dead: Nor did I ever think to have been ſo bleſt as this; but I muſt inquire my beloved Meriel, when you are able to anſwer me. I muſt know how you have been ſo long hid from me, and why it was reported you were dead. Are my brother and ſiſter Howard both dead?"—</p>
                     <p>She might have proceeded in her queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions uninterrupted; for aſtoniſhment had deprived me of the power of ſpeech. Yet perfectly conceiving in a moment the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme felicity of having a mother! a mother who loved me, my heart alſo felt lightened of a load of anguiſh. He, who had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted my ſeduction was not my father, he was no relation, only by marriage. Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, my beloved Celia, cannot you perfectly comprehend the rapture that thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to my ſoul. Oh! my friend—I am certain, it is utterly impoſſible: for you are
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:029439_0623_0FE11B8E32E17F58"/>
unacquainted with guilt. The very idea of it inſpires you with horror; then, what muſt have been my feelings on the reflection, that I had kindled a guilty paſſion, from which nature ſhrinks back aghaſt!—But human nature, with all its frailties, could never ſink into ſuch depravity.—Unable to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate a ſingle word, I threw my arms round her neck and overpowered by the pleaſing ſenſations that ruſhed over my heart, I ſunk into inſenſibility. How long I remained ſo, I cannot even conjecture; but when I recovered, I ſeemed as though awaking from a deep ſleep, and was full of the idea of a delightful dream.—How charmingly was that dream realized, when putting back the curtain I ſaw my mother! my kind affectionate mother, ſitting by my bedſide.—"How are you, my child," ſaid ſhe, in an accent of the ſofteſt maternal kindneſs.</p>
                     <p>I was extremely faint, and could ſcarcely anſwer, but yet I felt better and I told her ſo. From that hour I began to amend, and was in the courſe of a few days able to be removed to my mother's houſe, where I was introduced to my father. Oh! bleſſed thought, that I ſhould live to ſay I have a father!—a noble! honourable! father!—whoſe every action of his life, is an eulogium
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:029439_0624_0FE11B940E81B6F0"/>
on the goodneſs of his heart; reflects a credit on the nation of which he is a native, and the religion of which he is not only a profeſſor, but a ſtrict follower of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</p>
                     <p>When I was taken from the lodgings which I then occupied, to my dear mother's houſe, a new ſource of aſtoniſhment pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented itſelf. My mother had a perſon with her, whom I had often heard her mention as an eſteemed friend and companion. The day after I was ſettled in her family, I was introduced to this lady and diſcovered in her, tho' greatly altered the perſon of Mrs. Talbot, whom you may remember Mr. Howard kept in a very unbecoming manner, even in the houſe with his wife, my dear, though ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid aunt.</p>
                     <p>She went abroad with a lady, who was following a huſband, whom ſhe loved, and who, from neceſſity, being an officer in the army, had been ſeparated from her. When Mrs. Talbot left Woodbine-cott, ſhe did not know her own ſituation; but about ſix months after, ſhe became the mother of a girl. This girl ſhe left in the care of a Mrs. Alton, while ſhe herſelf accompanied her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy up the country in ſearch of her huſband. A variety of incidents, unneceſſary here to
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:029439_0625_0FE11B9707F14788"/>
relate, detained them ſeveral years from the place where ſhe left her child. On her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, neither friend nor child were to be found. Celia, do you not already know that this child is the very Miſs Alton, whom my brother, as I have been accuſtomed to call him, would have married. My ſoul ſhudders, when I think of the eſcape he has had. This Miſs Alton, is his ſiſter, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural daughter of his father. Good Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens! to what ſins are mortals led, as it were blindfold; by the vices of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. The meeting between the mother and the daughter was very affecting. Mrs. Talbot has retained thoſe good reſolutions, with which ſhe has been pleaſed to ſay I firſt inſpired her. She loſt the friend whom ſhe accompanied to India, when ſhe had been there about ſix years, and was ſoon after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the notice of that excellent woman, whom I have now the honour to call mother! with whom ſhe has continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ever ſince, as a companion, a friend, and the ſuperintendent of her family.</p>
                     <p>When I am more compoſed, and my ſtrength will better permit me, I will give you a few particulars of the life of this dear, this new found parent; but at preſent, I am not permitted to devote above an hour out of the four and twenty to writing, and this letter
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:029439_0626_0FE11B9CC4F5CA68"/>

                     <p>IN my laſt, I promiſed a few of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of my mother's life, and I will now give them without further preface.</p>
                     <p>She was ſeveral years younger than Mrs. Howard; and when her ſiſter was married, was ſtill at ſchool. At the early age of ſixteen, ſhe became acquainted with Mr. Harcourt, the
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:029439_0627_0FE11BA0010A9230"/>
only ſon of a wealthy Eaſt-India merchant, with whom ſhe entered into the moſt ſacred bonds before any part of either family even ſuſpected there was an intimacy ſubſiſting between them. Her father died ſoon after this union had taken place, died uninform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it—and her mother followed him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe had an opportunity to diſcloſe the ſecret of her ſituation: for Mr. Harcourt dreaded the anger of his family, ſhould they diſcover that he had married a woman with ſo ſmall a fortune as two thouſand pounds. My aunt Howard, whom I ſo long conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as my parent, was then ſettled, and was the only friend my mother had, to whom ſhe dared impart her marriage, and to this diſcloſure ſhe was driven by neceſſity; for ſhe found herſelf likely to become a mother. Mr. Howard was at that time on a viſit to a friend ſome hundred miles from Woodbine cott, and my aunt offered her ſiſter an aſylum, there, till ſhe ſhould be releaſed from her bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. It was there I was born, and on the very day of my birth intruſted to the care of the faithful Deborah, who had been brought up by my grandmother and married from her houſe. She ſolemnly vowed never to divulge the ſecret of my birth; and when three weeks after, my aunt Howard was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of a child, who expired in a few days, it was determined that ſhe ſhould adopt
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:029439_0628_0FE11BA5C3EB99E0"/>
me and ever take care of me as her own, till it ſhould be in the power of my parents to claim and acknowledge me.—Deborah alone, was privy to the impoſture, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy has ſhe proved herſelf of the confidence placed in her. My father's friends having cauſe to ſuſpect he had formed ſome attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which did not altogether coincide with the plans they had formed for his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture eſtabliſhment in life, had ſent him off on a commercial plan to Bengal, whilſt my mother was lying in. Diſtracted by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, as ſoon as her ſtrength permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhe reſolved to follow him; and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me in the care of Mrs. Howard, ſhe embarked for India; but on her arrival at Bengal learnt that her huſband had execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his commiſſions at that place, and was gone with ſome Engliſh factors up the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: impelled by a pure and ardent affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe followed the route he had taken, but in vain. War began to advance with horrid ſtrides, followed by devaſtation and famine, and whilſt ſearching for her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, my mother fell into the hands of the enemy. Lovely in her perſon, ornamented with all the charms of youth, ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a valuable prize among the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and was ſold to a merchant, who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed ſlaves for the Grand Segnior. By long and tireſome journies ſhe reached Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:029439_0629_0FE11BA9C1FC9B20"/>
and was preſented to the royal Turk, but fortunately her perſon did not pleaſe him, and ſhe was only purchaſed, merely to fill up the number of his wives; without once receiving a viſit from him, or being ſolicited to entertain him in an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per manner. Ten years was ſhe detained in this place, where ſhe ſays her time would have paſt pleaſantly enough, had it not been for the remembrance of my father and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but the thought of what might have become of us, prevented her being happy or receiving the leaſt ſatisfaction from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſcenes of luxury and amuſement that daily ſurrounded her. In the ſummer ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Grand Segnior ſent his wives and all the female part of his family in large parties to the different houſes he had in the country: and in one of theſe excurſions my mother was ſtruck with the appearance of a ſlave, who uſed to walk on a terrace before the windows of the apartments appointed for the women, apparently in a very ill ſtate of health. In the party of woman of which my mother made one was a beautiful tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> who was ſiſter to the Grand Signior, her name was Zayde. She had ever ſhewn a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible partiality to my mother, and cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her friendſhip with the utmoſt care. She endeavoured to attain from her inſtructions ſome knowledge of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

and liſtened with attention, when ſhe ſtrove to inſtruct her in the precepts of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion.</p>
                     <p>This young princeſs perceiving one day, that my mother regarded the ſick ſlave with fixed attention, took an opportunity to tell her, the ſlave was hers, that he was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, and had made an impreſſion on her heart.</p>
                     <p>"I love him," ſaid ſhe, "but I have never told him ſo. I only endeavour to make his ſervitude leſs painful by ſhewing him every kindneſs in my power; but when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I tell him I am ſorry to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

"Thus much," continued ſhe, I can underſtand; but as I cannot ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehend his meaning, I wiſh you would ſee and talk to him ſome evening, when, if you can learn from him, what will be moſt conducive to his happineſs, I will exert my utmoſt power to procure it for him."—My mother complied with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Zayde, and one evening in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of July ſhe accompanied her into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:029439_0631_0FE11BB3F32E8DE8"/>
to give the Chriſtian ſlave the promiſed meeting.</p>
                     <p>The moon was at the full—but the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere was cloudy, and though it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſtinguiſh objects, yet the light was not ſufficient to permit a diſcrimination of features.</p>
                     <p>She addreſſed the ſlave in Engliſh, told him how much Zayde was intereſted in his behalf, and begged to learn from him, what could be done to comfort his mind, and aſſiſt in the reſtoration of his health.</p>
                     <p>"I might ſay," replied the ſlave, "that liberty would reſtore me to all I ſo feeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regret—but, alas! lady, I have loſt what it is not (I greatly fear) in the power of fate to reſtore.—Married in early youth to a lovely woman, who, to the charms of an engaging perſon, added all the faſcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting beauties of a pure and elevated mind, and ſeparated from her in the very moment when the delicacy of her ſituation moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a huſband's tenderneſs and fond ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, think what I muſt ſuffer from an abſence of eleven years, without having once heard whether either herſelf or child are living. Sent from England by the cruel, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tenderneſs of parents, who valued wealth
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:029439_0632_0FE11BB93364FF68"/>
above every other earthly conſideration—thrown by the chance of war into a ſlavery, from whence I can never hope to eſcape; I am, I feel am, loſt to the world and dead to every thing but a remembrance of what I have been and what I now am."</p>
                     <p>"Alas! it is very ſad," replied my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bending forward to wipe off the tears ſhe felt trickling from her eyes.</p>
                     <p>Juſt then the moon broke from the cloud that had obſcured her brightneſs and ſhed her beams full on the face of the perſon with whom ſhe was converſing. A ſcream of mingled ſurpriſe and joy eſcaped her.—It was her huſband, who under the ſame maſter, for the ſame term of years had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured ſlavery, and yet no lucky chance had ever brought them together. Nay, even when ſhe had obſerved him on the terrace, his viſage was ever bent toward the earth, and his hat pulled over his eyes, and ſhe had no opportunity to diſcover features, which however altered by ſickneſs and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row were ſtill freſh in her memory, ſtill dear to her heart.</p>
                     <p>They candidly revealed their ſituation to the generous Zayde, who was indefatigable till ſhe had contrived the means for their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape.—
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:029439_0633_0FE11BBBCB6C7040"/>
"And will not you accompany us," ſaid my mother, when ſhe informed her of the plan ſhe had laid, and gave into their hands the means of putting it in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>"No," ſhe replied, "you my dear friend have taught me the foundation of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion; it teaches us to compaſſionate and relieve the diſtreſſes of our fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but it alſo teaches us never to forſake our parents. I have a mother living, who is old. She ſays, I am her only comfort.—It will be wrong to leave her, to deprive her of what conſtitutes her whole felicity. Go then, my friends, embrace this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of emancipating yourſelves from ſlavery: leave me to the performance of my duty: and pray for me, that though I do not, perhaps, purſue the right Chriſtian mode of worſhip, yet, that the offerings of a ſincere and grateful heart may be accepted at the throne of mercy."—</p>
                     <p>With eyes and hearts overflowing with gratitude and affection did my parents take leave of this fair benevolent Mahometan; but though they regained their liberty, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous incidents prevented their return to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, till within theſe four years laſt paſt. They had frequently written to inquire after
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:029439_0634_0FE11BC15A482A28"/>
me; but never received any anſwer; and when they arrived were informed from many people that all Mr. Howard's family were dead, except the ſon, who was abroad.—</p>
                     <p>Mr. Harcourt found that his own family, except ſome diſtant branches, were entirely extinct, and that a large fortune waited only his appearance and proper claim. This he is now maſter of, and to this I am now the acknowledged heireſs. Careſſed by my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, reſpected once more by the world, who now again behold me ſurrounded by affluence, my health and ſpirits daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, what have I more to wiſh for?—Alas! Celia, we are never content, and I moſt ardently deſire my poor Rookſby's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to complete my felicity.—Kingly too, I could wiſh to hear that he was well and happy. But I will offer the ſacrifice of thankſgiving for the bleſſings I have received, and for futurity truſt entirely to a wiſe and bountiful Providence, who has never yet forſaken me, and who I humbly hope never will.</p>
                     <p>I have been once to ſee Kingly's children; my mother went with me: they are both well. Clara's children are at the ſame ſchool and enjoy the ſame advantages. Generous Kingly may heaven reward you for the diſintereſted

kindneſs you have ſhewn theſe poor orphans, for indeed they are literally ſo, being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by both father and mother.</p>
                     <p>My dear Celia, pray for me, that I may ſupport this unexpected, this wonderful ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of fortune as I ought, that while I ſhare the pleaſures of affluence I may never forget the pangs of poverty or turn a deaf ear to the cry of affliction.</p>

                     <p>I AM returned to England once more; for my mind was ſo haraſſed by the thoughts of what might be the fate of my beloved Meriel, that my health declined, and I was adviſed to ſolicit an exchange and return to my native place; where the air might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore me. I complied with the advice of my friends, not from any opinion of my own that I was in danger, for the complaints of the mind are ſo far ſuperior to thoſe of the body, that I was not ſenſible of my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining ſtate. Meriel, in affliction, without friends, without ſupport, continually haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my imagination.</p>
                     <p>On my arrival in England, I went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to my agent. He had heard no ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of her. His heart was not intereſted; he had therefore made only a few inquiries
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:029439_0637_0FE11BCD65FFF378"/>
and finding them fruitleſs, had given up the ſearch.—I determined to remain a few days in London to reſt after the fatigues of my voyage and then viſit my dear boys.—My time hang heavy on my hands and I ſaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a coffee houſe towards the cloſe of evening. A brother officer accoſted me; we chatted a few moments on indifferent ſubjects, and he propoſed going to the play. I accompanied him juſt to while away the time, rather than from any hope of amuſement. Juſt before the curtain roſe, an elderly gentleman entered the box op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to that in which I was ſitting, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a lady, whom at the firſt glance, I knew to be my adored, my lovely Meriel. Health again adorned her countenance and ſparkled in her eyes; yet there was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on her features a ſort of penſive ſhade, which ſeemed to ſay, ſhe might be happier. Her dreſs though, ſweetly ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and becoming, yet beſpoke the wearer in affluent circumſtances, and the aſſidious attention of the gentleman, who accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied her, was evidently the effuſions of tenderneſs. She received them with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency; nay, returned them with looks beaming expreſſive affection.</p>
                     <p>A young man in the box with me obſerved the emotions in my counteance, whilſt I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:029439_0638_0FE11BD280CFC380"/>
her.—"Do you know that lady," ſaid he,—"I think I do ſir, I have ſome idea that her name is Rookſby."—</p>
                     <p>"I don't know her name," ſaid he, "but ſhe is a damn'd pretty creature, and that old fellow deſerves to be gibbetted for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolizing her."—</p>
                     <p>A chill of horror ran through my heart, can Meriel Howard, ſaid I, mentally, be ſunk from that eminence of virtue, which ever diſtinguiſhed her, into ſo low, ſo piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a character, as to exiſt on the wages of proſtitution? "Does ſhe live with that gentleman?" ſaid I, to my intelligencer.</p>
                     <p>"'Tis thought ſo," he replied, "ſhe is quite a new face. I have ſeen her often in public with him, and ſhe ſeldom is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by any one but an old woman, who looks like a convenient."</p>
                     <p>"And is that all the reaſon you can give" ſaid I fiercely, "for injuring the character of a woman that ever was, and I truſt ever will be free from blemiſh."</p>
                     <p>Oh! no," ſaid he, "when I firſt ſaw her, it was at the opera; and I was told ſhe was a woman of that ſtamp; for ſhe left her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band

                     <p>I was going to anſwer with great warmth and inquire the name of the perſon, who had thus dared to ſport with my character; but my friend interpoſed and obliged me to quit the play-houſe without any farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
                     <p>This tranſient glance of my dear Meriel, added to the villainous aſſertions of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent coxcomb, who vilified her name, had ſuch an effect on my ſpirits, that reſt was a ſtranger to my eyes. I had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the name of the gentleman with whom I ſaw her: it was therefore impoſſible to trace her out. For many evenings I frequented the theatres, the opera-houſe—every place of public amuſement; but was ſtill unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful. She was not at any, or if there, was effectually concealed from me.—Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, ill, diſguſted with every object that ſurrounded me, I determined one morning to viſit my children, who I had previouſly heard, were well, and endeavour to loſe my chagrin in their innocent careſſes. The ſchool they were at is about twenty-five miles from town. I took a poſt chaiſe and arrived at the place about eleven o'clock. An elegant carriage ſtood at the gate, which drew off to
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:029439_0640_0FE11BDCF0A7CB98"/>
give me room to alight. I aſked the ſervant who opened the gate, for my boys. "They are in the parlour," ſaid he; I followed him, in fancy anticipating their dear embraces. He threw open the parlour door. I advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and ſaw, ſeated at the upper end of the room, ſurrounded by the four boys, (for Clara's children are there) diſtributing to them, toys and fruit, the intereſting figure of Mrs. Rookſby. Aſtoniſhment riveted me to the floor. She looked toward me; joy flaſhed from her eyes. An exclamation of ſurpriſe eſcaped her, and before either of us had time for reflection, I found I had ſeated myſelf beſide her and claſped her in my arms, while the dear children were climbing round, each ſtriving to be the firſt to ſhare my ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes. However joy had for a moment made her forget herſelf, ſhe ſoon recovered her uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al air of cautious timidity and diſingaging her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from my embrace, ſhe preſented me to an elderly lady, whom till then I had not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; and whom ſhe addreſſed by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing title of mother. They propoſed taking the children home with them and diſmiſſing my chaiſe to take a ſeat in their coach and all return to town together.—During our ride, ſhe unfolded to me a tale of wonder, unneceſſary here to repeat; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe informed me ſhe has written your Amelia a full account of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="158" facs="unknown:029439_0641_0FE11BE18488B4A0"/>
I am a frequent viſitor at Mr. Harcourt's, and enjoy her ſociety undiſturbed by the fears of the world's cenſure; for under the ſhelter of paternal protection, who ſhall dare to arraign her conduct? She informs me ſhe has not heard from her huſband, ſince his releaſe from the King's bench: but imagines he is wandering abroad with the wild Clara. You will hardly believe it poſſible, that young Howard, who refuſed to aſſiſt or even acknowledge the dear Meriel, when ſhe was in diſtreſs and he thought her his ſiſter, has been to pay his reſpects to her ſince he has diſcovered ſhe is a wealthy rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. She received him politely; but did not aſk him to repeat his viſit. He is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent," ſaid ſhe, "he does not want aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and I do not wiſh to be peſtered with his company."</p>
                     <p>Far different was her conduct to Heſter Moſſop, who is now a widow with three children and in very indigent circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. She met Mrs. Moſſop by accident at a perfumer's ſhop, and judging from her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance that ſhe was no longer the wealthy, haughty woman, who had never known diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, accoſted her in a manner, that encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged her to make her a viſit; nay, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her to do ſo. From her ſhe learned Heſter's neceſſities, and heſitated not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:029439_0642_0FE11BE62A6DADD8"/>
to exert her benevolence to remove them. She inquired after Suſan. Tears were the only anſwer ſhe received.—Alas! poor Suſan! ſeduced by Belger, led into all manner of folly by Clara, ſhe fell from one degree of vice to another, till oppreſſed by the complicated evils of infamy, diſeaſe and a broken heart, ſhe ſunk into an untimely grave, in her laſt hours in want of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon neceſſaries of life. Meriel gave a tear to her memory and to ſooth the affliction of the mother immediately formed a plan for Heſter's ſupport. She advanced money for her to take a ſhop furniſhed well with haber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſhery and hoſiery; and by the many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations of Mrs. Harcourt, ſhe is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to gain a very decent ſubſiſtence. Young Moſſop is married to a rich heireſs; but they live in ſome town very diſtant from London, and he found it quite inconvenient to write and inquire after his mother and ſiſters.</p>
                     <p>I hope, now, we ſhall ſoon ſee you in England: I feel uncommonly happy, and I wiſh you to ſee and ſhare my happineſs.—Methinks, the wheel of fortune has gone its round: and we who have been thrown the very bottom, are now beginning to riſe. I ſee my dear Meriel enjoying all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, all the elegances of life—careſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:029439_0643_0FE11BEB3A6EE490"/>
eſteemed by all, and I cannot help indulging the flattering hope, (call it not chimerical) that I ſhall one day call her mine! Oh! Onſlow—when that bleſt hour arrives! (if ſuch an hour Heaven has in ſtore for me) when I ſhall ſee the affection of her faithful heart beam from her expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive eyes, unchecked by fear, I ſhall think myſelf at the very ſummit of human felicity!</p>

                     <p>YOU will perhaps be ſurprized, my dear madam, to receive a letter from a perſon to whom you are a ſtranger; but though I never was honoured with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of Miſs Shelburne, yet ſhe has no doubt heard of Amelia Sidney, who has been ſo highly honoured by the friendſhip of our equally beloved Mrs Rookſby.—</p>
                     <p>That lady from a variety of incidents has been prevented from writing to you for ſeveral months paſt; and I am now deſired by her to inform you that ſhe is in health; but totally inadequate to the taſk of relating to you the ſcenes in which ſhe has been lately engaged.—I know her motive for thus declining a taſk which ſhe ever conſidered pleaſureable, that of writing to her eſteemed Celia is delicacy: ſhe cannot inform you of
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:029439_0645_0FE11BF06DC92D18"/>
what has lately occurred, without making mention of her own magnanimity. Her fortitude has ever been conſpicuous, it has ſuſtained her under ſome of the heavieſt trials to which the human heart is incident; but in this laſt ſhe has riſen almoſt above humanity. Pardon the expreſſion; for I am fully ſenſible how much the human heart is capable of, it is tempered by a great, an all wiſe Being, who will never inflict trials be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our power to ſupport;—but we daily ſee ſuch inſtances of depravity that we look with a kind of wonder on thoſe who through life maintain that dignified conduct, that purity of manner and univerſal benevolence which is the true characteriſtic of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.—But I intrude on your patience, and defer the intereſting narrative. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed then.</p>
                     <p>On my arrival in England after an abſence of ſix years I was both ſurprized and pleaſed to ſee the alteration which had taken place in the circumſtanes of our friend. She had regained all that ſoftneſs, that delicacy of countenance, for which ſhe has been univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally admired; but which ſickneſs and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row had when I left her faded into langour. She was chearful and apparently happy; but ſtill ſome hours of painful reflection would intrude; for ſhe was totally ignorant
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:029439_0646_0FE11BF9E1B45B60"/>
of the fate of her huſband. He might return to England, he might demand her from her father and mother, when he found her the affluent heireſs of a large fortune.—Theſe ideas continually haunted her, and ſometimes interrupted her moſt chearful hours. Mrs. Harcourt had invited me to ſpend a few weeks with them at a feat of their's ſituated on the banks of the Thames, near Windſor. I accepted the invitation, and had been there near three weeks, when Mrs. Rookſby entered my appartment one morning, pale and ready to faint. She could not ſpeak, but put a note into my hands, which ſhe had juſt received. It was from Clara—and in a few incoherent lines, repreſented Rookſby in a moſt wretched ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, dying and in the utmoſt diſtreſs.—I had known ſo many inſtances of Clara's art, that I endeavoured to perſuade Mrs. Rookſby from the reſolution, ſhe had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of going immediately to town and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtering relief to her huſband: but all I could ſay, joined to the united entreaties of her parents, could not prevail, and all I could do was to accompany her. She or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the coachman to ſet her down accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the direction contained in Clara's bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. It was at a mean houſe in an obſcure ſtreet in Weſtminſter.. We enquired for her huſband by the name of Moreton, and was
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:029439_0647_0FE11BFE20659058"/>
ſhewn up two pair of ſtairs into a ſmall back room, where on a bed without hangings, lay all that remained of the once elegant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent Rookſby, worn to a ſkeleton, and in the very laſt ſtage of a decline, (for he had never recovered the effects of the wound) and riot and intemperance had haſtened the period of his exiſtence.—Beſide the bed, (ſupporting his head on her arm, the tears flowing from her eyes) ſat Clara: but I could never have conceived it to be the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Clara, who had ſtolen the heart of Rookſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by from our dear friend, for her appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was ſquallid and miſerable. Sunk eyes, pale cheeks, every indication of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe and poverty was marked upon her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.—</p>
                     <p>She turned her eyes towards us as we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, but without changing her attitude. She has very fine eyes and in ſpite of their languor ſtill retained ſufficient expreſſion, to inform us, that ſhe was equally oppreſſed by the ſituation of the poor ſufferer on the bed, and ſhame at appearing in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the woman ſhe had injured beyond reparation. Our excellent Meriel advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, (checking the powerful feelings of her heart) and as with one hand, ſhe took one of her dying huſband's, ſhe extended the other towards Clara: and in accents ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:029439_0648_0FE11C0383929CA0"/>
audible, bade her be comforted. Struck by ſuch an uncommon proof of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the poor ſuffering criminal ſunk on her knees. She claſped the hand extended towards her, raiſed her ſtreaming eyes;—but could not give vent to the fullneſs of her heart by words.</p>
                     <p>"Go," cried our magnanimous Meriel, "go, my poor penitent Clara, and compoſe yourſelf: I will ſtay and attend my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:" then turning to me, ſhe continued, "Shall I entreat you Amelia to return and inform my parents that you have left me in the performance of my duty: that you have left me attending the ſick bed of a huſband, who raiſed me from obſcurity to an elevated fortune: tell them, I remember not his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors—they were the children of human nature:—but his benevolence will never be obliterated from my mind.—That was the offspring of Heaven.—As ſhe ſpoke, ſhe waved her hand; I found it was impoſſible to diſobey her, and retired from the apartment—but not from the houſe. I diſpatched a ſhort note to Mrs. Harcourt and then exerted myſelf to obtain for Rookſby, and my dear rigidly duteous friend, every aſſiſtance which money could procure.—It is a ſad thing to acknowledge, but ſo it was, thoſe very people who had ſuffered Rookſby
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:029439_0649_0FE11C06158A4C28"/>
and Clara to want even the means to ſupport exiſtence, whilſt they thought them deſtitute of friends and money, no ſooner ſaw them viſited by perſons, who were ſuppoſed weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and beheld the contents of my purſe, which fortunately was amply ſupplied, than they were ready to run! to fly! to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any dirty, or painful work for which they expected to be well paid. But I mean not to make human nature deſpicable by this obſervation. Theſe people were poor.—And God knows we may all yield to temptations, when poverty is the ſtrong incentive.</p>
                     <p>I heard from my friend every hour, though ſhe herſelf imagined I was returned to her father and mother. About midnight I heard an extraordinary buſtle up ſtairs, and on inquiring the cauſe, found that Rookſby who had never been able to ſpeak to his angelic wife more than monofylables, ſince her arrival, had been ſeized with a kind of fit, and was expected every moment to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. I thought it improper for Mrs. Rookſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be left in ſuch a ſituation to the entire care of ſtrangers, and therefore ſent up word that I was returned from the country with a meſſage from her mother, and if ſhe pleaſed would come up. She ſaid, ſhe would be happy to ſee me. When I went into the room I found her ſeated on the bed, ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:029439_0650_0FE11C0C13561E78"/>
her dying huſband, who was at that time eaſy and ſeemingly dozing. His right arm was encircling her waiſt, his head reſted on her boſom, ſhe pointed to a chair by the bedſide, but did not ſpeak. On the oppoſite ſide of the bed, ſtood a woman with volatiles which they had been applying to the noſe and temples of the expiring man; and at the foot was Clara on her knees her eyes elevated, her hands, claſped, and her whole countenance bearing teſtimony to the anguiſh that rent her ſoul. In my life, I never ſaw a more intereſting ſcene, nor never I hope ſhall I witneſs ſuch another.—I ſat down in ſilence, and in a few moments the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, whom Mrs. Rookſby had ſent for arrived. He pronounced the patient paſt all hope, and a few hours confirmed the ſentence. It was near ſeven o'clock, when ſtarting as it were from ſleep, he gazed ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently on his wife.</p>
                     <p>"Oh Meriel," ſaid he, "I dreamt I was in the realms of bliſs and you conducted me there. Bleſſed woman, if you forgive me, if you pray for my enterance into that place of eternal peace; I ſhall, I know I ſhall, be received.—"Oh!" ſaid ſhe, with fervour, "May Heaven ſo forgive my offences as I pardon every offence of yours toward me.—"But Clara," cried he,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:029439_0651_0FE11C102BB09200"/>
"poor guilty Clara!"—"I will be her friend," replied Mrs. Rookſby. "Enough," ſaid he, "may every bleſſing crown you here, and everlaſting joys"—He could not finiſh the ſentence, but remained ſilent and almoſt inanimate for the ſpace of half an hour. He then moved and took a cordial which ſhe offered him. I prevailed on her to quit her painful ſituation at the head of the bed and let him lye down. She did ſo, but he ſtill retained her hand.—Juſt before the final ſcene cloſed, he raiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a little, and looking earneſtly in her face—"My children," he cried, "my dear boys."—"Are they not mine," ſhe replied in an accent to which no words can do juſtice.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! what a wretch I have been!!!"—ſaid he.—His head ſunk on her ſhoulder, he endeavoured to throw his arms around her, but Death had arreſted their power.—He groaned—ſtruggled for the power of utterance—and in that ſtruggle expired.</p>
                     <p>I knew the extreme ſenſibility of the heart with which I had to deal. I attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to conſole her, I rather encouraged her to give a looſe to her feelings, and in a few hours ſhe became ſufficiently compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſubmit to my direction, and ſuffer her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be conveyed to her father and mother:
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:029439_0652_0FE11C15C8CECE78"/>
but not 'till ſhe had given proper directions for the future ſupport of Clara. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy woman confeſſed in the anguiſh of her heart, that at the very moment when our incomparable friend gave her aſſiſtance and countenance in Devonſhire, ſhe was ploting her ruin, that the chief part of the letter ſhe wrote to her, and of which you have had a copy was the invention of her own brain, and that from a very child ſhe has been the offſpring of folly.—</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Rookſby heard her confeſſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any emotion, ſave that of compaſſion, and when ſhe had finiſhed, bade her not deſpair but reſolve on a new courſe of life, and truſt in that bounteous Creator for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, who never turned from the truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.—She has ſent this unfortunate and I may ſay guilty woman into Wales, were ſhe has become reſponſible for her board, and allows her ten pounds a year for her pocket and extra expences. The children ſhe has taken entirely under her own care.</p>
                     <p>My dear Miſs Shelburne, I cannot help now indulging the moſt ſanguine hopes, that I ſhall ſee this worthy woman rewarded for all her ſufferings; ſhall ſee her ſoon united to the man to whom for many years ſhe has been ſincerely attached, and from whom only the moſt cruel treachery could
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:029439_0653_0FE11C1AA1080E00"/>
have ſeparated her;—for Heſter Moſſop has confeſſed that ſhe was the author of thoſe letters which prevented her union with Rainsforth. We do not let Mr. Harcourt know that Heſter has made this confeſſion, for he would never forgive her, and I much fear would inſiſt on Mrs. Rookſby's with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing her friendſhip entirely from her.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Rookſby bid me ſay ſhe will write as ſoon as ſhe is able, and in the mean time deſires you will believe ſhe can never be otherwiſe than your friend, and in the ſame rank begs leave to be placed,</p>

ſhe had told you that I had promiſed after my year of mourning was expired, to give my hand to the man, who firſt poſſeſſed my heart.
