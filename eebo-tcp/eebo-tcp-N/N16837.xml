            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN every nation of the world there is ſome notion of a ſupreme being, and ſome kind of influence which this notion has on the minds of men, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them to fear, hope, confidence, and other affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which bear the name of religion. It has alſo been uſual, from the earlieſt ages, for ſome perſons to be peculiarly devoted to the offices of religion, who have been ſuppoſed to have a more intimate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the object of worſhip, than the body of the people, and in conſequence thereof to be more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of directing, inſtructing, and aſſiſting them in things of a religious nature. In ſome countries the ſyſtem of religion has been intimately blended with the civil conſtitution and military eſtabliſhment, ſo that no affairs of government, or of war could be undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en but by the advice and aſſiſtance of the prieſthood. In others, their miniſtry has been chiefly directed to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021673_0005_0FB505F60503E7B0"/>
the inculcating principles and opinions relating to the inviſible world, compoſing literary works, reciting hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical facts, and preſerving them for the information of poſterity, performing devotional ceremonies, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating children, ſtudying the nature of diſeaſes and medicines, attending the ſick, and performing the rites of ſepulture.</p>
            <p>IT is not ſtrange, that when perſons of ſagacity and experience are profeſſionally devoted to ſuch offices, they ſhould thereby gain an influence over the minds of men, and induce them to repoſe great confidence in them, as perſons ſtanding in a near relation to inviſible, ſuperior beings. Where ignorance and ſuperſtition hold their gloomy reign, it is not unuſual for this order of men to be regarded as the diſpenſers of bleſſings and curſes, holding the fates of individuals and of nations in their hands; nor is it uncommon for them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated with the idea of their importance, and to abuſe the power which they have gained over their fellow-mortals, to ſerve the purpoſes of ambition, avarice and ſenſuality. But as vapours in the atmoſphere, when they have riſen to a certain height, are unable to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves in the ſuperior regions; ſo it often happens that exorbitant power falls by its own weight. When the claims of ſpiritual uſurpers are examined by the calm light of reaſon, or thwarted by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of the rich and powerful, they are not able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their extravagance, but are obliged to ſubmit and be curtailed. Nor is it unuſual for the world to paſs from one extreme to the other; and from reverencing the prieſthood as the repreſentatives of divinity, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them as infernal emiſſaries, employed in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021673_0006_0FB505F9030C3E30"/>
the rights of men, and miſleading them to ſerve the moſt wicked purpoſes.</p>
            <p>EXAMPLES to elucidate theſe obſervations may be brought from the hiſtories of all nations, heathen as well as chriſtian, and of all times, ancient as well as modern. The preſent age does not want authors who are as laviſh of their invectives againſt the clergy, as any of the clergy themſelves were of their own praiſes in the height of their uſurpations. True reaſon and genuine philoſophy will always diſregard indiſcrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inate cenſure on whole bodies and profeſſions of men; but the enemies of religion very ſeldom exerciſe that true reaſon or genuine philoſophy of which candor is an eſſential attribute. Too indolent to examine, too corrupt to lie open to conviction, they imbibe preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and repeat invectives of which they ought to be aſhamed. But, while ſuch invectives have an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the vacant and unguarded mind, there is no ſmall danger, that a ſpecies of vulgar infidelity, which has its foundation in debauchery and ill manners, may weaken the bonds of ſociety, and introduce a laxity in morals, which even the religion of nature, as it is now underſtood, would utterly condemn.</p>
            <p>IF the exiſtence of a Deity, the obligations of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and the ſanction of future rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, be allowed to have an influence on the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of ſociety, there muſt be an advantage ariſing from the public teaching of theſe principles, by an order of men deſtined to this ſervice, who are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted in the truths which they deliver, the precepts which they inculcate, the motives which they exhibit,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:021673_0007_0FB505FB41EF9B00"/>
and the proſpects which they open to view, equally with thoſe who hear them. Every friend to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic or private happineſs of mankind muſt allow, that perſons who are employed in ſuch a beneficial office, who decently perform their duty, and endeavour to honour their profeſſion by exemplifying the virtues which they recommend, are entitled to as much reſpect as thoſe who prudently conduct the affairs of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and adminiſter public juſtice; eſpecially, when neither the one, nor the other, are impoſed on the people, but are freely elected to their offices, by a known and regular conſtitution; and are equally amenable to their conſtituents for any miſbehaviour in their reſpective offices.</p>
            <p>THAT ſuch men have an aſcendency over the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with whom they are connected, is a fact demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by experience and founded in the principles of human nature. This was well known to the wiſe and benevolent Author of Chriſtianity; and therefore, in the precepts which he has given for the conduct of his miniſters, he has provided how this influence ſhould be maintained, what purpoſe it ſhould be directed to ſerve, and how the abuſe of it ſhould be prevented. As his miniſters have no ſiniſter deſigns in view, nor any ſecret arts by which their conduct is governed; ſo the commands which are given for their direction are equally open to the inſpection of all to whom they miniſter: who may learn from thence how far it is ſafe to let their teachers gain an aſcendency over them, and how to guard againſt the abuſe of it. Our text contains a remarkable precept of this kind: it has a negative and a poſitive part; the former is intended to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021673_0008_0FB505FECBC3FE50"/>
guard againſt uſurpation; the latter, to direct the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial influence into its right channel.
<q>Neither as being lords over God's heritage; but being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamples to the flock.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. THE negative part of this exhortation, like many other precepts of the goſpel, ſeems to have been dictated, not only by a benevolent regard to the beſt intereſt of mankind, but by the ſpirit of prophecy; which foreſaw the apoſtacy of ſucceeding times, and gave the church a precious antidote, to be uſed either by way of prevention or remedy. The neceſſity of ſuch a caution is fully evident from the numberleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of uſurpation and dominion with which eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical hiſtory abounds, as well as from the nature of power, which always needs a check. The utility of the precept is evident from the benefit which the church has received by an attention to it. It is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to miniſters, to keep down the ſpirit of domination in them; and it is open to the inſpection of the whole church of God, that they may uſe proper means to check the workings of ſuch a ſpirit as ſoon as it makes itſelf viſible. The church is here called, God's heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, in alluſion to the ancient church of Iſrael, which is ſpoken of as the Lord's inheritance. The deſign of the phraſe is to ſhew the property which God has in his people, and his ſole right of dominion over them in ſpiritual things. In this view, the language is very proper, becauſe the divine right of government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> over them being acknowledged, all influence or authority derived from that ſource muſt be ſubordinate to it, and directed to the ſame end; conſequently, all other dominion muſt be conſidered as uſurpation and abuſe.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:021673_0009_0FB50601E5B85B58"/>
That influence or authority which aſſumes to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from God, for the benefit of his church, muſt bear the marks of its heavenly origin. If it does not in ſome good meaſure reſemble God himſelf, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be from him, and conſequently is not to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to by his people.</p>
            <p>I SHALL not take up your time with reciting the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of criticks and commentators on the terms uſed in the text. The queſtion among them ſeems to have been, whether the lordſhip, here forbidden, be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral power, in diſtinction from ſpiritual; or arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and oppreſſive power, in diſtinction from limited and gentle. Thoſe who are advocates for blending temporal and ſpiritual power in the clergy (or rather in the higher orders of them) ſeem to have forgotten what our Lord ſaid to his diſciples, when they had imagined he was about ſetting up a temporal king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and were contending which of them ſhould be the greateſt in it;
<q>The princes of the Gentiles exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe dominion over them, and they that are great exerciſe authority upon them; but it ſhall not be ſo among you.</q>
This prohibition affords a ſufficient comment on what the apoſtle ſays in the text. Peter had learned of his Lord not to aſpire to temporal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, or to exerciſe authority over the lives, and eſtates, and worldly concerns of the people who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the church of God. Though once infected with this error, he had been cured of it, and was deſirous of guarding all ſucceeding miniſters againſt it. The care of theſe things muſt be left to civil magiſtrates, whoſe office it is to bear rule in temporal concerns; the buſineſs of eccleſiaſtical officers is confined to things
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021673_0010_0FB5060386DDFEE0"/>
of a ſpiritual nature; and even here, they have no right to preſcribe or define articles of faith, and modes of diſcipline; nor to inſiſt on a ſtrict conformity in the people to their ſentiments; nor to cenſure and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate others for differing in opinion from them; but they are to let every one ſearch the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for himſelf, and form his own judgment concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is truth; and they are to ſeek for peace and edification in the exerciſe of mutual forbearance and charity, rather than in uniformity. However plauſible ſuch a thing may be in theory, experience has decided againſt it; and it is hoped that the chriſtian world will ſo profit by their knowledge as never to repeat the experiment.</p>
            <p>BUT, not to enlarge on this head; the negative command in the text may fairly be underſtood to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance, not only the aſſumption of civil and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral authority in the miniſters of the goſpel; but all harſhneſs and ſeverity, "a lofty look and a proud heart," an overbearing, dogmatiſing temper, and a want of condeſcention to human weakneſs.
<q>The ſervant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle to all men, apt to teach, patient; in meekneſs inſtructing thoſe who oppoſe themſelves, if peradventure God will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. LET us now conſider the ſecond part of the text, which is a poſitive direction for the conduct of Chriſtian Miniſters, "but as enſamples to the flock." The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titheſis here is very ſtriking, and affords us an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant remark. Not as lords; but as examples. Then, if we aſſume power which does not belong to us, we

are not examples. If we are lofty, arrogant, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, diſdainful, and overbearing, we are not exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to the flock. Were the flock to follow ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, they would reſemble beaſts of prey rather than ſheep.

            <p>BLUSH at this, ye aſpiring pontiffs, and imitators of aſpiring pontiffs! ye, who affect to carry your heads above your brethren, and pretend to be more digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and more holy than they! your ſacerdotal claims have been examined, and TEKEL is written upon them. Would you enjoy a real dignity? deſcend to your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per level; imitate your Maſter; be the ſervants of his people; and wait for your exaltation, till you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the EUGE from his lips.</p>
            <p>IT is ſcarcely neceſſary to obſerve, that the language of our text is an alluſion to the cuſtom of ſhepherds in the oriental countries, who train their flocks to the practice of following them, and thus lead them where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they would have them to go. They know the voice of their ſhepherd, they tread in his ſteps, and they fear no danger in following him. What a lively emblem of the power of good example! The Miniſters of Chriſt are beings of the ſame rank with the People committed to their charge: they have the ſame inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021673_0012_0FB5060968417B20"/>
to ſerve: they cannot miſlead them without injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves; and they cannot honour themſelves or benefit their people more, than by going before them in a ſteady uniform practice of the various duties which they recommend by their preaching.</p>
            <p>MUCH judgment is neceſſary to conduct that part of the miniſterial buſineſs which reſpects public in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; much ſtudy and prayer muſt be uſed to diſcover and to deliver divine truth, ſo as to enlighten the underſtandings of the hearers, and impreſs them with an idea of its importance. As this divine truth equally concerns thoſe who preach as thoſe who hear, it is natural to enquire how far the preachers themſelves are affected by it. It gives pleaſure to an attentive audience to obſerve that the ſpeaker is affected with the delivery of goſpel truths; but neither the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preaching of them, nor the appearance of being affected by them in public, will give complete ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to perſons of diſcernment. There muſt be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ariſing from the practical influence which theſe truths have on their life and conduct.</p>
            <p>THIS is the appointed way of judging concerning our ſincerity; "by their fruits ye ſhall know them;" this is the way of judging in other caſes, and it is the only ſolid foundation on which a ſatisfactory judgment can be formed. When a perſon prepares for public exhibition, whether in the pulpit, at the bar, or on the ſtage, he will endeavour to make his performance agreeable, ſo as, at leaſt, to ſupport his reputation; but no one can judge of his ſincerity merely from this circumſtance; neither can ſuch a concluſion be drawn
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021673_0013_0FB5060AB83BB0E0"/>
from the appearance of being deeply affected in the public delivery; but there is in the life and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, a ſilent, ſteady evidence, which is credible, becauſe unaffected. This evidence is the reſult of principle and of habit: it is founded on a deep conviction of the nature and importance of goſpel truth; of its impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, not only to mankind in general, but to ourſelves in particular. The goſpel muſt in ſome meaſure have its genuine influence on our own hearts, before we can, with any propriety or conſiſtency, recommend it to others; and when we have begun to feel this happy influence, and to declare to others what we ourſelves know to be true, the purſuit of thoſe ſacred ſtudies will be a noble advantage to us, not only in acquiring and methodiſing our ſpeculative ſentiments, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining our paſſions, regulating our affections, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our views, and forming our true characters. We ſhall not only grow in knowledge, but that knowledge will be reduced to practice; we ſhall be caſt into the mould of divine truth; our hearts and lives will be faſhioned according to the doctrines which we preach, the duties which we inculcate, the examples which we recommend, and the proſpects which we open from the word of God. Every diſcourſe, which we prepare for public delivery, will be firſt preached to ourſelves; we ſhall feel the force of what we ſay; our hearts, like wax under the ſeal, will receive the impreſſion, and our lives will ſhew to the world that the goſpel which we preach has its proper effect on ourſelves.</p>
            <p>GOD, in the courſe of his providence, will train us up for farther uſefulneſs in his church, by placing us in circumſtances ſimilar to the reſt of mankind, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021673_0014_0FB5060E6FD80C00"/>
putting us into trials which will give occaſion for the exerciſe of the ſame virtues which we recommend to others. As we are men of like paſſions with them, ſo our temptations and our afflictions are of the ſame kind; we experience the pleaſures and the pains ariſing from proſperous and adverſe circumſtances in life: our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial connections afford various opportunities for prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing the ſocial duties; and our knowledge, acquired by experience, correſponding with what we gain by ſtudy, will accompliſh us for eminent ſervice in our miniſterial character. It is in trials that virtue ſhines; and when Providence affords us theſe trials, then our example ſhould be ſuch as may inſtruct and edify our people. Then we preach with a ſilent, yet perſuaſive eloquence; and ſuch practical, exemplary preaching will leave a laſting impreſſion on the minds of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers.</p>
            <p>IT may perhaps be here objected, that if the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary life of a miniſter be of ſuch importance, we ought to be well aſſured of his being really a good man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can receive any benefit from his preaching. Nay, ſome may carry the matter ſo far as to doubt the validity of ordinances adminiſtered by one who is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral. In anſwer to this, I beg you to recollect the words of the Weſtminſter Aſſembly, in their anſwer to the queſtion,
<q>How do the ſacraments become effectual means of ſalvation? Not from any virtue in them, or in him that doth adminiſter them, but only by the bleſſing of Chriſt, and the working of his ſpirit in thoſe who receive them by faith.</q>
Miniſters, even of the beſt characters, are but inſtruments of diſpenſing the word and ordinances; they are but earthen veſſels,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021673_0015_0FB5061380038A40"/>
in which the treaſure is contained; and though their good example may add a luſtre to what they preach, yet their bad example can by no means prevent the efficacy of the word and ordinances to the proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of them, becauſe this efficacy depends on other cauſes. Man, whether good or bad, can ſpeak only to the outward ear, God muſt ſpeak to the heart. Paul may plant and Apollos water; but God giveth the increaſe. The apoſtles were ſent to preach the goſpel, and no exception was made of Judas; though his Lord knew him to have a wicked heart. A divine power might, and probably did accompany his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as well as that of the others, for their report, when they returned, was,
<q>Lord, even the devils are ſubject to us through thy name.</q>
Judas, though a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſon and a falſe profeſſor, yet is not charged with corrupting the word or inſtitutions of Chriſt. He was ſent out, with the others, to preach, to baptize, and to work miracles. If Chriſt had deemed his miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions invalid, becauſe of the badneſs of his heart, he would not have ſent him; and this may be aſſigned as one reaſon why our Lord employed ſuch a perſon as Judas in the miniſterial work, to make his people eaſy with reſpect to the efficacy of the word and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, though adminiſtered by a perſon whoſe heart may not be right with God. The conſequence will indeed be dreadful to the perſon himſelf, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the work of the goſpel miniſtry from no better motives than Judas did; but his hypocriſy cannot hinder the word and ordinances from being effectual to others, if their hearts be properly diſpoſed to receive ſpiritual benefit from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:021673_0016_0FB50615E06FFC50"/>IT will not follow from hence, that any perſon, knowing himſelf to be immoral, may warrantably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the work of a goſpel miniſter; nor that any church may call ſuch an one to office, nor continue him in it, after his immorality is manifeſt, if there be no ſigns of repentance. Great charity, however, is to be uſed in forming our opinion of the moral characters of miniſters, as well as of other people. No man can be too ſevere in examining himſelf, nor too candid in judging another. Suſpicions and unſupported aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt have no weight: reaſonable evidence muſt be admitted; but candor ought, at the ſame time, to be exerciſed; and when the fruits of repentance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, charity will admit them as credible, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender will be
<q>reſtored in the ſpirit of meekneſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering ourſelves leſt we alſo be tempted.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE concluſion from theſe remarks is, that though the real goodneſs of a miniſter's heart be not eſſentially neceſſary to the validity of his adminiſtrations; yet his good example is of ſo much importance to the ſucceſs of the goſpel which he preaches, that he ought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with the utmoſt caution to the preſervation of his character. His duty is to watch over his heart and life, to ſubdue his appetites and paſſions,
<q>to keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his body, and bring it into ſubjection, leſt, when he has preached to others, (and perhaps done ſome good to them) he himſelf ſhould be a caſt-away.</q>
His good example ſhould be uniform and unvaried: He ſhould never lay aſide his miniſterial character in any company, nor on any occaſion.
<q>Remember, my friend, (ſaid the good Mr. Hervey, in a letter to a young miniſter) remember, when you are in company,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021673_0017_0FB50616B7C0B868"/>
that you have written a pious book, and do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate all your exhortations to others, by forgetting them in your own converſation.</q>

                  </gap>.</note> Though there are ſeaſons in which we may indulge innocent mirth; yea, though we may always appear cheerful and pleaſant; yet there is a decency and dignity which ſhould be mixed with our cheerfulneſs; which will ſerve to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our deportment agreeable and conſiſtent; which will evidence to the world that our religion is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected nor conſtrained, but natural and eaſy.

            <p>WILL my honoured Fathers and beloved Brethren in the goſpel miniſtry indulge me in addreſſing a few words to them on this occaſion?</p>
            <p>YOU are, doubtleſs, fully ſenſible of the vaſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the duty which has now been recommended, and the many weighty conſiderations by which an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to it may be enforced. Our ſituation in life is ſingular; mankind are continually obſerving us; ſome with an eye of candor and reſpect; others of jealouſy and envy. Some are looking to us as examples for themſelves to walk by; they are pleaſed and edified when they ſee us conform to the pattern of our Maſter; and they are grieved and diſtreſſed when we do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. There are others who envy us the influence which we have in ſociety; who are jealous that we are aiming at more power than we have a right to; who love to magnify our imperfections, and rejoice when
<pb n="19"

we fall. It becomes us, therefore, to be very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in our converſation and behaviour. We are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to
<q>give no offence in any thing, that the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry be not blamed.</q>
The faults of a few often ſerve as the foundation of reproach on the whole order; and we are all ſuppoſed to be equally guilty, though ſome have more art to conceal it than oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. We live in the midſt of a ſcoffing world; but, thanks be to God, we have always found, and ſhall always find fellow-helpers to the truth, to keep us in countenance, and ſpeak comfortably to us. If, therefore, we have diſcouragement on one hand, we have encouragement on the other. This has been the caſe with the miniſters of God in all ages. This was the caſe with Chriſt himſelf, and the ſervant muſt not think it ſtrange to be "as his maſter." To pleaſe the humours of all men is impoſſible, and to attempt it would be beneath the dignity of our character. Our buſineſs is to preach the truth, and to practiſe what we preach; to be examples to the flock
<q>in word, in converſation, in ſpirit, in faith, in purity.</q>
Let us then be careful and guarded in all our conduct, at all times, in all places, in all companies, in private and in public. Let our behaviour be a ſtanding confutation of the cavils of infidels <note n="*" place="bottom">"To a philoſophic eye (ſays the celebrated GIBBON) the vices of the clergy are far leſs dangerous than their virtues."—A ſentiment wholly unphiloſophical, becauſe wholly void of truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:021673_0019_0FB5061FB3EC30C8"/>
of our lives; but it is a weakneſs of which it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to cure them. Some may be able to reaſon ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractedly as to ſeparate the doctrine of the preacher from the influence it has upon him, and, like the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Elijah, may be nouriſhed by the heavenly food, though brought in a raven's mouth; but the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of mankind will expect that we live as we preach, and will not profit by our miniſtry unleſs we profit by it ourſelves. "Phyſician, heal thyſelf," is an old and a popular ſaying, and we muſt conform to it. He who knows our frame, who is perfectly acquainted with our motives, and principles of action, has therefore commanded us to be examples to the flock. Our obedience to this command will prove that we are his true miniſters, worthy to be entruſted with the care of his people. This is the way to maintain that influence over them which will be for their edification; and this is alſo the way for us to obtain the joy of preſenting them as a chaſte virgin to Chriſt, and to have them for the crown of our rejoicing in the day of the Lord.</p>
            <p>My dear Brother, who is now about to take the charge of this flock, will permit me, while I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate him on this joyful occaſion, to put him in mind of his part in the duty which has been recommended.</p>
            <p>I DOUBT not, dear Sir, that you know, by your own experience, that the goſpel which you preach is the power of God to ſalvation. I truſt you know ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its influence on your own ſoul, and that there is laid in your mind a good foundation for this people to expect, that you will teach them, not only by your
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:021673_0020_0FB50621F34E4AE8"/>
preaching, but by your example, that you will care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſtudy the ſacred oracles, to ſee what you are to preach, and how you are to practiſe; ſo that you may, not only in the pulpit, but at home and abroad, on all days, and in all circumſtances, be teaching them how they ſhould walk ſo as to pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>WE have no reaſon to ſuſpect that you will ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to lord it over God's heritage; you will neither dogmatiſe in your preaching, nor be arbitrary in your conduct. You will preach what you believe to be the truth, and charge your hearers to judge of it by the ſame infallible oracles from which you derive your information. You will not puzzle them with meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical ſubtleties, but will aim to feed them with the ſincere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby. To inſiſt much on controverted points, may ſerve to feed a party-ſpirit; but is not good for the uſe of edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying. That preaching is generally the moſt ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, which is the moſt ſearching, the moſt ſpiritual, the moſt practical. We ſhould aim directly at the heart; and endeavour to make men feel their concern in what we preach; and the moſt effectual way to do this, is to feel it ourſelves. The truth, when it comes from the heart, will be likely to reach the heart. Our hearers know that we are made of the ſame materials as themſelves; and when they ſee that we are affected and influenced by what we preach, they will conclude that there is ſomething in it which ought to affect and influence them. This is an advantage which we have above angels. Were they employed in delivering the ſame truths, the church of God could not derive ſuch a benefit from their miniſtry; becauſe, being of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021673_0021_0FB506236FC270C0"/>
order in the ſcale of exiſtence, it might be thought that we were exerciſing ourſelves in things too high for us, if we ſhould attempt an imitation of them. But it may be reaſonably expected that if we practiſe what we preach, our hearers will follow our examples, as well as hearken to our inſtructions.</p>

will at the ſame time remember that he is but a Man, and therefore liable to err. If you exerciſe candor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, in regard to his infirmities, you may even derive an advantage from them; for you will ſee how readily he will attend to your friendly cautions, and ſet you an example how to correct your own errors. You will have not only his example to influence you, but the ſure and infallible word to go to, wherein you will find what his example ought to be. If he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms to the dictates of truth, you will have a double ſatisfaction, firſt in knowing how he ought to walk; and then in obſerving that he walks by the rule; and being fully ſatisfied on both theſe points, you need not fear to let him gain an influence over you and your families, becauſe he will uſe it only for your edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Your confidence will be well placed in him, and you may at all times conſult with him for your ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual benefit; you may expect that he will give you the beſt advice, and you may be ſure of an intereſt in his prayers. If you attend to his temporal intereſt, and make his life comfortable; if you keep him free from difficulty and embarraſſment in worldly matters; he will richly repay your kindneſs by attending diligently to your ſpiritual concerns; by providing for your ſouls the beſt entertainment, by counſelling you in your dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, by comforting you in your afflictions, and by ſetting you a bright example of the virtues and graces of the goſpel. May you and your children be happy in your connection with him; and may this connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be founded on ſuch ſolid principles, and cement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch genuine mutual love, as that it may not be diſſolved through eternity.</p>

               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:021673_0023_0FB5062AE6AC92E0"/>LET me now conclude with a word of advice to this whole Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>YOU are all members of particular churches and congregations, ſome of which are furniſhed with min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters, and others perhaps are deſtitute. Thoſe of you who have miniſters to go before you in the practice of religion, ſhould eſteem it as a moſt valuable privilege. Learn to profit by their example, as well as by their preaching. Learn to treat them with kindneſs, to form your opinions of them with candor, and if you diſcover any error in them, to inform them of it privately, with meekneſs and love. Wherein you ſee that they follow Chriſt, let it be your care to follow them. The goſpel which they preach to you, is the rule by which both they and you will be judged at the laſt day. This rule is open for your inſpection, as well as theirs, and you will be greatly to blame if you neglect to ſtudy it. Let it be your care to form your hearts and lives by this unerring ſtandard, that when you and your miniſters ſhall be called before the bar of Chriſt, you may be able to meet them with joy, and that your ſalvation may increaſe their happineſs.</p>
            <p>DO any of you belong to deſtitute congregations? you may take a hint, from what you have now heard, to direct you in your choice of a paſtor. The accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments of a learned education, added to natural abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, are by no means to be neglected; but the good qualities of the heart are the moſt eſſential; and for this reaſon, that a good heart is commonly a pledge of an exemplary life. Speculative opinions are in their nature liable to change. A man may not only very
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:021673_0024_0FB5063031B816A0"/>
innocently, but very conſcientiouſly alter his opinions on points of ſpeculation; but if the heart be well eſtabliſhed in grace and goodneſs, it will never alter but by improving itſelf under the direction of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit in the virtues of the goſpel; in conformity to the example of Chriſt, and in preparation for heaven. Such a miniſter, wherever found, is a great bleſſing. God grant that the number of them may be increaſed; that all his flocks may be ſupplied with paſtors after his own heart, who ſhall feed them with divine truth, and walk before them in holineſs; that we may all dwell in love and peace here, and finally come to that glorious ſtate where our brighteſt hopes ſhall terminate in complete enjoyment of the promiſed bleſſings.</p>

            <p>REPROVE, exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man deſpiſe thee, but be thou an example of the believers in word, in converſation, in charity, in ſpirit, in faith, in purity.</p>
            <p>PUT your hearers in mind to be ſubject to principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities and powers, to obey magiſtrates, to be ready to every good work.</p>
            <p>IN all things, ſhew thyſelf a pattern of good works. Watch thou in all things; endure hardneſs, as a good ſoldier of Jeſus Chriſt; do the work of an Evangeliſt, make full proof of thy miniſtry.</p>
            <p>THUS you will ſecure to yourſelf, peaceful reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions; a comfortable death; and a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</p>

            <head>THE RIGHT HAND of FELLOWSHIP, BY THE REVEREND MR. OSGOOD, Of MEDFORD.</head>
            <p>THE expreſs deſign of the goſpel is to <hi>gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one, all things in Chriſt, both which are in heaven and which are on earth</hi>—under HIM, the conſtituted Head of angels and men, collecting into one family all the heirs of future felicity, by an eternal union, binding them to him, and to one another, in the endearing bonds of love and charity. The chriſtian temper, truly imbibed, conſtrains mankind to dwell together in unity, like brethren. Under the influence of this temper, private Chriſtians feel themſelves to be members of one body, and are prompted to a mutual ſympathy. Each diſtinct church acknowledges its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to its ſiſter churches, and, in all matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, ſeeks their approbation, advice and aſſiſtance. Their reſpective paſtors and teachers, claiming no pre-eminence one above another, and calling no man Maſter, conſider each other as ſtanding on the foot of equality in office; and as brethren, bound mutually to love and aſſiſt one another. Some token of this fraternal affection ſeems proper and ſuitable, and with this the goſpel ſupplies us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:021673_0028_0FB5063C34256168"/>FROM the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles, we learn, that when thoſe pillars of the church, James, Cephas, and John, ſaw with what qualifications and gifts the grace of God had diſtinguiſhed, and furniſhed him for preaching the unſearchable riches of Chriſt among the heathen, they gave to him, and his companion Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas, <hi>the right hand of fellowſhip,</hi> thereby receiving and acknowledging them as ſuſtaining the ſame office with themſelves, and inveſted with equal privileges and authority. In imitation of this apoſtolic exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it was, in the days of our anceſtors, at the firſt planting of the goſpel in this land, and ſtill it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to be, the cuſtom of theſe churches, on occaſions like the preſent, by the ſame token, to ſignify their mutual charity, their approbation of the newly-ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or inſtalled paſtor, and their readineſs to join with him, and his charge, in all offices of chriſtian love and fellowſhip.</p>
            <p>AND as the venerable Council, now convened, have aſſigned this part to me, I DO, REVEREND SIR, with a ſincere affection, in their name, give you my RIGHT HAND. By this, we publicly acknowledge you to be a miniſter of the goſpel of Chriſt, regularly intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to this ſacred office: We bid you welcome, as a brother and fellow-labourer in the vineyard of our Lord. Truſting that you will approve yourſelf to God, a workman who needeth not to be aſhamed, rightly dividing the word of truth, and not ſhunning to declare the whole counſel of God, we teſtify our wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to ſupport and encourage you, to afford you our beſt advice and aſſiſtance, as occaſion may require,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:021673_0029_0FB5063F46840B88"/>
—earneſtly wiſhing you aid from above, and much of the promiſed preſence of the great Head of the church, to render you faithful and ſucceſsful in your endeavours to ſerve him, and to ſave the ſouls of men.</p>
            <p>AT the ſame time that we make theſe friendly aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances to you, we depend upon the like kindneſs and brotherly affection from you; and that not only to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, but to the miniſters and churches of our Saviour in general; you will be always ready, to the utmoſt of your ability, for every pious and charitable office.</p>
            <p>OUR honoured and beloved Brethren of this Church and Congregation will accept our unfeigned congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations on the event of this day. Various and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable have been the diſpenſations of Providence towards you; great and ſtriking the changes through which you have paſſed. Your brethren around you have alternately mourned and rejoiced with you. We have not yet forgot the melancholy ſcene, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common calamities overwhelmed and deſolated this ancient and reſpectable town, literally ſcattering its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants into corners, and diſperſing them abroad through the land. But judgment was then tempered with mercy. Amidſt all your diſtreſſes, you were the conſtant care of a kind and gracious Providence. Like as a father pitieth his children, you were the objects of the divine compaſſion. And He who gathers the outcaſts of Iſrael, and rebuilds their waſte places, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your captivity, and bleſſed the work of your hands. The beauty of the Lord was ſoon viſible upon you, and your fair and flouriſhing appearance was beheld
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:021673_0030_0FB50641EBCED418"/>
with admiration by thoſe who had ſo lately witneſſed the greatneſs of your ruin. We joined with you in thankſgiving to God for this return of proſperity; and hoped that it might be the kind purpoſe of Heaven, that <hi>you ſhould be glad and rejoice, according to the days wherein you had been afflicted, and the years wherein you had ſeen evil.</hi> Our joy was the greater, in hope of your ſpiritual proſperity, and of the revival among you of that which is more eſpecially God's own work—the work of grace in your hearts.</p>
            <p>A FOUNDATION for ſo pleaſing a hope ſeemed to be laid in your ſurmounting the difficulties and obſtacles which for many years had prevented the reſettlement of goſpel ordinances among you, and in the remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unanimity with which you made choice of the late Mr. PAINE for your paſtor. His amiable temper, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected piety, and promiſing abilities, aided by the warmth of your affection towards him, were happy preſages of your ſpiritual welfare.</p>
            <p>BUT how ſoon was this fair morning overcaſt! what a heavy gloom ſucceeded! The grave ſwallowed up our hopes. You were again left as ſheep without a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd—in danger of thoſe diviſions, the ill effects of which you had before ſo long and ſadly experienced.</p>
            <p>WE honour you, my beloved Brethren, for the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with which you have guarded againſt them, for the care and circumſpection with which you have preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bond of peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for the harmony and love with which you have again ſo ſpeedily ſought, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily obtained a man to be ſet over you in the Lord. We moſt heartily join in grateful praiſe to Him, with
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:021673_0031_0FB5064A78FC5160"/>
whom is the reſidue of the ſpirit, that while he diſmiſſes ſome from his vineyard, he raiſes up, furniſhes, and ſends forth other labourers into his harveſt. We bleſs the great Repairer of breaches, that your late loſs is, this day, ſo happily made up in one, whoſe mature age, opportunities for knowledge, and ſpecimens already given, both of literary and moral improvement, are ſuch as afford ground to hope for his diſtinguiſhed uſefulneſs. May he anſwer your raiſed expectations, and continue to receive, from you, that affection and reſpect which you have hitherto ſo generouſly expreſſed. In a work ſo great, difficult and important, he will need the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, encouragement, and daily prayers of a kind and grateful people. To render them to him, will not be more for his comfort than for your profit. Aware that upon a more intimate acquaintance, failings and infirmities are found to attend the greateſt and beſt of men, you will not be unprepared with candor to allow for human weakneſs. Not expecting perfection, it will be your ſtudy to forward all endeavours after it, and to do what in you lies, to ſtrengthen his hands and encourage his heart. And may God Almighty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his health, prolong his life, and render him a rich and laſting bleſſing to you; and finally grant that you may be his joy, and crown of rejoicing in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
