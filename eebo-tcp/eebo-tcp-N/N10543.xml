            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS this reply was made from the mere hearing of that diſcourſe, which was the occaſion of it. It cannot therefore be expected, that the very words ſhould be exactly remembered, to be made uſe of in the reply. But ſo far as the author's memory ſerved him, he has candidly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, fairly to expreſs the ſentiments held forth in ſaid diſcourſe, as he received and underſtood at the hearing. And ſo far as he has been able to learn, was generally underſtood by the auditory. And is as well aſſured, as one well can be in ſuch a caſe, that there is no eſſential miſtake made in any particular. Which ſhould there happen to be; may be eaſily ſet to rights before the publick, by the publiſhing of ſaid diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Which upon divers accounts, would be very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to many of the hearers. And a ſufficient juſtification of the ſtile of this reply.</p>
            <p>The view of the ſcriptures ſubjoined to the articles, is ſet forth for the aſſiſtance of ſuch, as have been too negligent, carefully to compare and examine for themſelves.</p>
            <p>And the appendix is added, merely to gratify the curioſity of the inquiſitive.</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>TRULY my hearers, I am really diſpoſed to look upon it, an inſtance of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful wiſdom of divine providence, in permitting ſuch a diſcourſe on church government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be delivered from this deſk, as you have lately heard. As not doubting, but it will prove an occaſion, of the more clear and ſatisfying manifeſtation of the truth on that ſubject; to the minds of many of you: From the reply, which I have now, by this providence, a loud call of God to make. With a view, neither to gratify nor reflect upon any perſon or party; but to approve myſelf in my office, as becomes a miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, by a faithful manifeſtation of the truth; and that in oppoſition to all the dangerous errors caſt in your way.</p>
            <p>In regard to which, I earneſtly crave, my hearers, your ſerious and candid attention, to the ſcripture proofs and plain reaſonings, fairly grounded thereupon; which I have to offer on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>You will ſuffer me to uſe great plainneſs of ſpeech, that if poſſible, ſuch as are dull of hearing may diſcern and underſtand. Gladly would I ſhun all perſonal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections:
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013360_0004_0F90F30CF16059B0"/>But plain and pungent repreſentations, muſt be admitted. I deſire to be heard patiently through to the end: And then every one, will be under advantage, fairly to judge for themſelves, whether what may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, be agreeable to the law and to the teſtimony or not.</p>
            <p>For the foundation of what is intended, I have choſen the words now read. <hi>Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you.</hi> To come at the full and proper force and meaning of which, it is requiſite to look into the context a few verſes back: In which an account is given, of the appearance of Jeſus to the eleven diſciples, on a mountain of Gallilee. <q>And when they ſaw him, they worſhipped him: But ſome doubted.</q> Ver. 16.17. <q>And Jeſus came and ſpake unto them, ſaying, all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</q> Ver. 18. In which, Jeſus made known to his diſciples the fulneſs of power that he was inveſted with by the father. As God indeed, the Son has in himſelf all power, equal with the Father. But as God man, mediator, his power was given to him of the Father. Even all power in heaven and in earth: Over all principalities and powers, both in this world and alſo in that which is to come. And of conſequence, all power both in the kingdom of providence and of grace. And as inveſted with, and in virtue of, this plenitude of power, Jeſus gave out a ſpecial commiſſion to his apoſtles, ſaying as in the 19th ver. <q>Go ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</q> As tho' he had ſaid, having all power in heaven and in earth given unto me; I do therefore now commiſſion, order, and ſend forth you my apoſtles; to go teach and diſciple all nations; baptizing all that believe my goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; in the name of the ſacred Three. <hi>Teaching them,</hi> as it follows in the words of our text, <hi>to obſerve all things
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013360_0005_0F90ECA9EE4F6C48"/>whatſoever I have commanded you.</hi> In theſe words then, we have the ſpecial orders given by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to the eleven diſciples, his apoſtles, when he commiſſioned and ſent them forth to teach and diſciple the nations. Authoriſing and directing them, to teach thoſe that ſhould be diſcipled; to obſerve all things whatſoever he commanded. Which ſtrict injunction, to teach the obſervance of all his commandments, plainly implies a reſtriction, not to teach the obſervance of any other commands. Jeſus had indeed farther commands, yet to give unto his apoſtles. And yet this injunction, ever continued in force binding upon them; to teach all and no other obſervances, but ſuch as he commanded. And now, tho' the apoſtles left no ſucceſſors in their proper apoſtolic office, yet this is the commiſſion, by virtue of which, all goſpel miniſters are authoriſed to teach and baptize. And according to which, they are all reſtricted to teach, even to the end of the world. For that in this ſenſe, it has reſpect to all ſucceeding miniſters of the goſepl, is manifeſt from the following ſentence: "And lo I am with you alway even unto the end of the world." In Mr. Henry's expoſition, it is obſerved upon the words of our text, <q>That Chriſtians are hereby obliged to confine themſelves to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt, and as not to diminiſh from them, ſo not to add to them.</q> And more generally, all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting divines, have taken the words in this reſtricted ſenſe. According to which, goſpel miniſters have no commiſſion or authority from Chriſt, to teach his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the obſervance of any laws whatever; but of thoſe only which he had commanded. So far as any goſpel miniſter therefore, teaches the neceſſity of obſerving in the church of Chriſt, any canon laws and rules of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man deviſing; he teaches for doctrine the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men: In direct violation of this his commiſſion by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:013360_0006_0F90F30DB3741A98"/>
But what we have now ſpecially in view is, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt reſpecting the government of his church. And here you are ſenſible the labouring enquiry is, whether Chriſt hath given laws ſufficient for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his church? The affirmative of which, I ſhall endeavour to prove. In oppoſition to that negative, which you have been lately taught. By this propoſition; that Chriſt hath given laws ſufficient for the government of his church, is not meant, you muſt obſerve, that Chriſt hath given rules in his word, in all reſpects ſo explicit, as not to leave room for the uſe of a diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary prudence in the church: Reſpecting circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of time, place, &amp;c. Many things of this ſort, are left diſcretionary, in the breaſts of the judges, in all, even the moſt perfect civil ſtates. But the meaning of the propoſition is: That Chriſt has given laws, ſo compleatly ſufficient for the government of his church, as not to need for that purpoſe, the addition of any canon laws or rules of human deviſing. In this ſenſe, I aſſume the affirmative; in direct oppoſition to that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in which it was plainly denied. And therefore pleaded, that there was a neceſſity of the addition of human rules and canons, for the purpoſes of church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>But what can be requiſite, to the laws of Chriſt being ſufficient for the government of his church; more than theſe three things? That the nature of the crimes cognizable, be ſufficiently ſpecified: The judges, pointed out with ſufficient plainneſs: And the nature of the proof required, ſufficiently expreſſed? In all theſe reſpects, it was ſtrenuouſly argued and inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That the laws of Chriſt are not ſufficient. Nor was there, that I remember, any deficiency argued; but what is fully comprehended under one or the other of theſe propoſitions. If therefore, it can be made to appear,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013360_0007_0F90F30F22F29820"/>that the matters contained under theſe three particulars, are pointed out in the goſpel, with preciſion ſufficient, for all the purpoſes of church government; it muſt follow by the conſent of all, that the laws of Chriſt are fully ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the government of his church, without the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any human canons for that purpoſe. Wherefore let the ſcriptures be carefully attended to reſpecting theſe matters. And as to the crimes then, that are properly cognizable before the church. See 1 Cor. 5.11. <q>But now I have written unto you, not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with ſuch an one, no not to eat.</q> Here is given an expreſs enumeration of ſeveral kinds of crimes; under the one or the other of which, are included moſt of the ſcandalous crimes, that mankind are incident unto. But ſee alſo, 2 Theſ. 3.6. <q>Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye withdraw yourſelves from every brother that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth diſorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.</q> By walking is here plainly meant an open courſe of life. For that courſe of life, in which any man openly liveth, in that he is ſaid to walk. And to walk diſorderly, is explained by the apoſtles own words to mean, walking not after, i. e. not agreeable to, the tradition received of us, the apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt. All which apoſtolic traditions, are now ſet forth in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the new teſtament. If any brother therefore, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in living openly contrary to ſcripture rule; he is to be withdrawn from, or ſeperated by the brotherhood from their communion. And ſo again, it is added in the 14. v. <q>And if any man obey not our word by this epiſtle, note that man, and have no company with him that he may be aſhamed.</q> But this epiſtle holds forth the validity of every divine rule. Every man therefore that lives in the open violation of any divine
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013360_0008_0F90F30F469F5000"/>precept; is to be noted and his company avoided; in all matters of ſpecial chriſtian fellowſhip. But farther hereſy alſo, is particularly mentioned. Tit. 3.10. <q>A man that is an heretick, after the firſt and ſecond admonition reject.</q> Under which, all ſcandalous damnable error is included. Beſides many other ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that might be mentioned directly to the purpoſe. But according to theſe already cited; all the commands of Chriſt, are to be conſidered as his laws ſpecifying matters cognizable before his church. And what rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal man can now ſay, but that the crimes cognizable by a church, are pointed out in the goſpel with a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion abundantly ſufficient?</p>
            <p>In the next place then, we are to conſider, to whom it belongs to act and concur in judgment. And whether this matter be pointed out in ſcripture with ſufficient plainneſs?</p>
            <p>It has been much inſiſted upon, that it cannot be learnt from ſcripture, who the church are, or of what members it doth conſiſt. Becauſe the word church, is ſometimes uſed in the goſpel in different ſenſes. But tho' the word church, is ſometimes uſed in the goſpel to different ſenſes; yet by the church, when meaning the church of Chriſt, in its preſent viſible ſtate here in this world: is always in the new teſtament plainly meant, a body or community of the ſame kind. And what ſort of a body that is, may plainly be diſcerned, from the model of the firſt church of Chriſt at Jeruſalem. As ſet forth Acts. 2.41; and on, <q>Then they that gladly received his word, were baptized: And the ſame day there were added unto them about three thouſand ſouls. And they continued ſtedfaſtly in the apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.—And all that believed were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. —And they continued daily with one accord in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013360_0009_0F90F30FF1844500"/>the temple.—And the Lord added to the church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</q> Thus ſuch as being baptized, were added to that number, which continued ſtedfaſtly in the apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers, were thereby added to the church: Which number therefore was the church. And every ſuch kind of number then, conſorting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the like purpoſes, is a church. Wherefore there can be no doubt, what is meant in the goſpel by a church; when a church of Chriſt is intended. And in the next place we find, that the exerciſe of diſcipline is committed to a church. And are plainly directed how it is to be introduced; and what the judgment or penalty to be inflicted upon incorrigible offenders. As in Mat. 18.15, and ſo on. <q>Moreover, if thy brother ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: If he ſhall hear thee, thou haſt gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes every word may be eſtabliſhed. And if he ſhall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: But if he neglect to hear the church, let him be to thee as an heathen man and a publican. Verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven: And whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven.</q> Here it is carefully to be noted, that the very ſame church, unto which an offence is to be told; are to judge thereof; and that from their judgment, there lies no appeal to any other board under heaven. Becauſe expreſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that according to the judgment of ſaid church, it ſhall be bound or looſed in heaven. Whereby an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute bar is laid in, againſt the judgment of any other board on earth. And neither therefore to be attempted, but in direct violation of this expreſs law of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:013360_0010_0F90F310B24DC308"/>
But it has been objected, that this could not be meant of a church of Chriſt: Becauſe his church was not yet formed. And muſt have reference therefore to the Jewiſh church. <q>But the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confeſs that he (Jeſus) was the Chriſt, he ſhould be put out of the ſynagague.</q> Joh. 9.22. Nothing therefore can be more abſurd, than to imagine, that Jeſus here meant to direct his diſciples, in caſe offence ſhould fall out among themſelves; to go and tell it to the Jewiſh church. The very ſuppoſition is an affront to common ſenſe.</p>
            <p>But altho' the church of Chriſt was not yet formed; yet, it is very clear from the context, that Chriſt is therein ſpeaking in ſpecial reference to his church, when it ſhould take place. For he is there expreſsly ſpeaking of the kingdom of heaven; and matters thereunto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining. And by the kingdom of heaven, in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is commonly meant, the new kingdom of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan here in grace, to be perfected in glory. Thus John the baptiſt, came preaching; <q>ſaying repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</q> Matt. 3.2. And again, <q>from that time Jeſus began to preach and ſay repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</q> Matt. 4.17. That is, the goſpel diſpenſation, is juſt about to be introduced. So here in the 18th of Matt. the diſciples ſaid to Jeſus; "Who is the greateſt in the kingdom of heaven?" V. 1ſt. Altho' as yet, they knew not what the form of Chriſt's church might be: Yet they were looking forward, in expectation of his ſetting up a new kingdom upon earth. And therefore, having yet ambitious views cleaving to them; they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired who ſhould be greateſt in ſaid kingdom. And Jeſus therefore, to convince them of the inconſiſtency of their ambitious views, with the nature of his new kingdom, <q>called a little child unto him, and ſet him
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013360_0011_0F90F312CFB84EA8"/>in the midſt of them, and ſaid, verily I ſay unto you, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye ſhall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever therefore ſhall humble himſelf as this little child, the ſame is the greateſt in the kingdom of heaven.</q> V. 2, 3, 4. Which has a plain reference to Chriſt's new kingdom of grace, teaching the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity of humility in all the ſubjects of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And ſo alſo it is very obſervable, that Chriſt took occaſion from the little child which he called and ſet in the midſt of them; to ſpeak of his little ones, believing on him; who were to be the ſubjects of his new king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of grace. And that in regard to the offences, that might ariſe towards them either from the world, or even one among another. In regard to offences ariſing from the world, Jeſus ſaid, <q>but whoſo ſhall offend one of thoſe little ones that believe in me, it were better for him that a millſtone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depths of the ſea. Wo unto the world becauſe of offences,</q> &amp;c. v. 6, 7. <q>Take heed ſaid Jeſus, that you deſpiſe not one of theſe little ones.</q> V. 10. And again, <q>even ſo it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of theſe little ones ſhould periſh.</q> V. 14. And ſo in continuation of the ſame ſubject, it is added in the 15 v. <q>Moreover if thy brother ſhall treſſpaſs againſt thee, go and tell him his fault,</q> &amp;c. Jeſus had ſpoken before, in reference to offences ariſing from the men of the world. That in regard to ſuch, it were better for them that a millſtone were hanged about their necks, &amp;c. Importing, that God himſelf, would be ſeverely avenged for his children upon them. But here Jeſus proceeds to point out to his little ones, believing on him; how to deal with one another, in caſe of offences falling out among themſelves; in his new kingdom of grace: In
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013360_0012_0F90F313E3713630"/>plain reference to which he is ſtill ſpeaking. Whence it is clearly manifeſt, that by the church is here meant Chriſt's church in his new kingdom of grace. Such as was that firſt church of Chriſt ſet up at Jeruſalem. And accordingly it is found in fact, that when the churches came to exerciſe diſcipline; all thoſe who conſorted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to eat the Lord's ſupper; did concur together, in putting away offenders. As in the inſtance of the inceſtuous Corinthian. St. Paul declared to that church, the mind and will of Chriſt about that matter. <q>To deliver ſuch an one unto Satan, for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus. Purge out therefore, ſaid he, the old leaven that ye may be a new lump, as ye are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened. For even Chriſt our poſſover is ſacrificed for us. Therefore let us keep the feaſt, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but with the unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth.</q> 1 Cor. 5.5. &amp;c. Plainly importing, that the whole body of communicants, which eat the feaſt of the Lord's ſupper together, were to concur, in purging out that old leaven of wickedneſs from among them; that they might be as a new and unleavened lump. Thus plainly is the church, to which the exerciſe of diſcipline is committed, pointed out: Even ſo plainly, that there can be no room for any but mere futile cavils about it.</p>
            <p>In the next place then, we are to conſider; whether the nature of the proof to be required, be ſufficiently pointed out. And to this purpoſe ſee Matt. 18.16. <q>That in the mouth of two or three witneſſes every word may be eſtabliſhed.</q> Which to common ſenſe, plainly imports, that the evidence of facts to a church; muſt be ſuch, as equals that credibility of a fact, which ariſes from the evidence of two or three credible witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013360_0013_0F90F3169CC5E010"/>And what that is, muſt in the nature of things, be left in the breaſts of the judges; in all trials whether ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or eccleſiaſtical. As to witneſſes being ſworn; it may be obſerved; That in every eccleſiaſtical trial, the proceſs is carried on in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The ſolemnity of which, is equal to the ſolemnity of an oath in any civil court.</p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly conſidered, what is expreſsly taught in the goſpel; of crimes, judges and evidence reſpecting church government. And judge ye now, my hearers, your own ſelves; whether the laws of Chriſt are not abundantly ſufficient, for all the purpoſes of church government; without the addition of any canon laws of human deviſing? Cavilling diſputers indeed, may cavil ſtill. But moſt certainly the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, does look upon the laws which he hath given for the government of his church, perfectly ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for that purpoſe. Becauſe he expreſsly declares in his word; <q>that the ſcriptures, which are given by inſpiration of God;</q> are ſuch, <q>that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good works.</q> 2. Tim. 3.16, 17. Plainly importing, that by the inſpired writings, the man of God may, as to laws and rules, be throughly furniſhed to every good work, and of conſequence, to all the duties of church government; without any ſuperadded canons about the matter. And indeed if it be not ſo, there is ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency left in Chriſt's kingdom; infinitely the moſt perfect of all kingdoms; as can never be made up; without a new revelation from heaven. Becauſe Jeſus as King and head of the church, is the only lawgiver therein. Of whom it is written, <q>the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our King, he will ſave us.</q> Iſai. 33.22. In which high and noble capacity, all power in heaven and in earth,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013360_0014_0F90F316C53DFAE0"/>is given unto him. Who never commiſſionated any of his ſervants; to ſet forth any laws or rules in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but only by his inſpiration or direction. Yea, but hath laid in a prohibition in bar, to prevent any of his ſervants from attempting, to ſet forth or teach the obſervance of any laws or rules in his church; but ſuch as he himſelf hath commanded: As implied in the words of our text. So that if the laws of Chriſt be deficient; they muſt, as to all human power and authority remain deficient to the end. And Chriſt's church, which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with his own blood, be left without laws ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for its well being, order and government; expoſed to the rage of a wicked world; and to inevitable diſorder and confuſion among themſelves. The very ſuppoſition of which, is a vile impeachment of the wiſdom and goodneſs of the glorious Lawgiver, on the holy hill of Zion: Of his wiſdom, as tho' incapable of giving laws ſufficient; or of his goodneſs, as tho' when capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he had not kindneſs enough for his church and people, to give them laws every way ſufficient for their well being. But as the Jewiſh church was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently furniſhed with laws to all needful purpoſes by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: Even much more is the goſpel church, by the laws of Chriſt. As plainly implied in that. Heb. 3.5.6. <q>And Moſes was verily faithful in all his houſe as a ſervant.—But Chriſt as a ſon over his own houſe, whoſe houſe are we.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But it has been ſuggeſted, that it is no argument of imperfection in the ſcriptures; that there is not yet ſet forth therein, all the laws that are needful to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church. Even as it is no argument of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in the ſcriptures, that the art of ſurveying and navigation, are not taught therein. Juſt as though the art of ſurveying, was as eſſential to the welfare and glory of Chriſt's kingdom; as the government and good
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013360_0015_0F90F317715739C0"/>order of his church. How weak and abſurd the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon?</p>
            <p>All ſuch arts and ſciences as relate to the affairs of the kingdoms of this world, are within the reach of human inveſtigation. Theſe therefore, are left to the inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men; under the guidance of a common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. But as to the kingdom of Chriſt, it is intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a different kind: not of his world, but of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, holy and heavenly nature. And therefore fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and provided with all needful light and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by divine revelation.</p>
            <p>Such my hearers, is the nature of church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pointed out in the goſpel; according to which, all the authority which is given for that purpoſe, is only of an executive nature, and that veſted in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar church. This is that order of church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, commonly called congregational. Which I have been aiming to teach, and practiſe. To which my conſcience is bound by the word of God. And by which I mean, thro' the grace of God, firmly to abide; as not doubting the approbation thereof by the great Judge of all.</p>

            <p>HENCE it was propoſed to conſider the commands of Chriſt; more eſpecially reſpecting the government of his church. Whether the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed given laws to his church. ſufficient for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thereof? Not ſo, but that circumſtances of time and place, &amp;c. are left diſcretionary. But ſo <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:013360_0016_0F90F31B2F2BB6D0"/>as not to need the addition of any canon laws or rules of human deviſing. The affirmative ſide of which I have aſſumed; in direct oppoſition to that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative part, which has of late been ſo ſtrenuouſly urged. As a counter part to which, the laws of Chriſt, as ſet forth in the goſpel, reſpecting this matter, have been particularly conſidered. Whence it hath been made clearly to appear, that the crimes cognizable, who the judges are, how cauſes are to be introduced, what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties are to be inflicted, and the nature of proof to be required; are all pointed out in the ſcriptures, with ſo much plainneſs and preciſion, as to be fully ſufficient for all the purpoſes of church government; without the addition of any human canons for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And now in reply to the many things, that have been held forth in vindication of the oppoſite ſide of the queſtion, I ſhall endeavour ſo far as my memory ſerves me, at a true repreſentation. And if any eſſential miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſhould be made, I promiſe to retract it; when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſhall be clearly manifeſted. For we do not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever much hath been injuriouſly ſuggeſted to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, arrogate all wiſdom and grace to ourſelves; never pretending to judge others of any ſect, as to their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtate: but leaving every man in that reſpect, to ſtand or fall to his own Maſter. It is only with their errors, manifeſted forth in words and in deeds, that we are concerned.</p>
            <p>It was urged, you may remember, as a matter mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in fact, that the laws of Chriſt are not ſufficient, for the purpoſe of church government; without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of human canons; in that the chriſtian world have been ſo divided about this matter; and have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted ſo many different forms of church government. Which, it is not ſuppoſable, they would ever have done, had Chriſt's laws been ſufficient to that purpoſe. But
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013360_0017_0F90F31B54115828"/>by this way of arguing, it muſt alſo be concluded, that there is no certain ſcheme of doctrine, ſufficiently ſet forth in the ſcriptures. Becauſe the chriſtian world are ſo divided about the great doctrines of religion. A way of arguing, which leads directly to that fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal maxim of deiſm, That human reaſon is the beſt guide in matters of religion. Such are the pitiful ſhifts, which even men of ſenſe betake themſelves unto, when driven off the ſcripture ground.</p>
            <p>It was alſo urged, that authority to exerciſe eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical diſcipline is not committed to, or inveſted in a particular church. Becauſe it is obvious to common ſenſe, that churches are made up of very unſuitable judges in ſuch matters: as including women, children, ſuperannuated and prejudiced members. And yet, it was allowed, that caſes of ſcandal ought to be firſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in particular churches, where they fall out; and if poſſible, ſettled by them. But what groſs inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is this? To ſay that the churches are not, according to common ſenſe, ſuitable judges. And yet, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording either to reaſon or ſcripture, it does belong to them to judge firſt in the caſe. Baptized children, it was ſaid, belong to the church. True, they do ſo. But under the wing of their parents, who act for them, until they come of age capable of acting for themſelves. And if then, they do not come as deſciples of Jeſus to eat the Lord's ſupper, they can have nothing to do, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſcriptures in receiving or rejecting others.</p>
            <p>But women alſo belong to the church, true. And according to the ſcriptures, females have as good a right as male-members, to be ſatisfied of the grounds of charity for thoſe, with whom they commune in the ſupper; and as good a right to the redreſs of all their grievances. If therefore, they cannot ſilently concur, with what the male-members act, they have moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013360_0018_0F90F31EB0274540"/>a right ſome way, to make known their griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>As to prejudiced members, that ought not to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, they need to be firſt taken care of and reclaimed.</p>
            <p>And as to ignorant and ſuperannuated members; there are none, that are capable of examining themſelves and diſcerning the Lord's body; as the ſcriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of all that eat the Lord's-ſupper; but that are able alſo, by the aſſiſtance of wiſer members, to judge about matters of fact. So that when ſuitable care is taken, about the admiſſion of members; churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guidance of their paſtors, are much better judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es reſpecting ſuch matters as are cognizable before them, than the jury in civil courts often are, in reſpect to many intricate caſes laid before them. But it has been urged, that if eccleſiaſtical authority be veſted only in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular churches; then there can be no dealing with an elder: but he muſt be left without controul, an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute pope. And it is indeed, no wonder, ſhould this ſeem to ſome a very weighty objection. But that it ſhould ſeem ſo to any, that read the goſpel with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is quite ſtrange. Becauſe it is ſo plain in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that he that runs may read; that there was a plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of elders, in every of the primitive churches. See Act. 14.23. <q>And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with faſting, they commended them to the Lord on whom they believed.</q> Before they had elders ordained; the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had the overſight and care of them: But now having ordained them elders; they commended them to the Lord, to be under his care and direction; and not under any other juridical authority under heaven. Accordingly we read of <q>Elders in the church at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem; of the elders of the church at Epheſus,</q> &amp;c. Which elders were to govern, not of themſelves juridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013360_0019_0F90F31F09E4D258"/>but with the concurrence of the church over which they preſided. Hence it is written, <q>Obey them that have the rule over you and ſubmit your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for they watch for your ſouls as they that muſt give account.</q> Heb. 13.17. It was thoſe that watched for their ſouls; that had the rule over them. When one elder therefore tranſgreſſed, the church with their remaining elders, or elder, might deal with the elder offending; as well as with any other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Now though a plurality of elders, be not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely eſſential to the being of a true church; yet, where there is this deficiency of elders, if the one that is, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends, the deficiency in the nature of things, by fair deduction from the word, is to be ſupplied; by calling in the aſſiſtance of neighbouring elders; not to rule of themſelves juridically; but even as their own elders, in concurrence with the church<note n="*" place="bottom">Hence alſo it may be inferred, That it is agreeable to the goſpel plan, that in judicial trials in a church, in which there is but one elder, neighbouring elders ſhould be called in, to make a plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality or preſbytery, unitedly to preſide, and to aſſiſt and act in concurrence with the church, even as the plurality of elders did in the firſt goſpel churches.</note>.</p>
            <p>But we have been referred to the 15th chap. of the Acts for ſomething like a juridical judgment of council. Excepting which, there was nothing pleaded, from the form of that council; nor upon any other grounds thro' the whole diſcourſe, to ſhow the neceſſity of conſociated, rather than congregational councils. But as to the council ſpoken of in that chapter. It is certain, it was nothing like the form of preſent conſociated councils. As it conſiſted only of the apoſtles that were at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, with the elders of, together with that whole church. For Paul and Barnabas that carried the queſtion; do not appear to have acted in council. The buſineſs of which council, was not any cauſe of diſcipline: But a
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013360_0020_0F9051934D46A2C8"/>queſtion of conſcience, about the mind and will of Chriſt; reſpecting the rites to be obſerved in the Gentile churches. And unto the apoſtles, it did in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner appertain, as inſpired men, to declare the mind and will of Chriſt in that matter, and accordingly their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, is ſet forth in the ſcriptures; as a part of the law of Chriſt, given by inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt: Binding upon his churches through all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>But the preacher pleaded, in order to make out that their judgment, was a precedent juſtifying the juridical judgment of ordinary councils; that its being ſaid, it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us, &amp;c. does not imply, that ſaid judgment was of divine inſpiration, any more than all rational concluſions, that are obtained by a common concurrence of the ſpirit. And to make out, that it was really no more of divine inſpiration; it was argued, that the council conferred and reaſoned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the ſubject. So that the determination was merely of reaſon and not of divine inſpiration. A very notable concluſion indeed, for a miniſter of the goſpel!</p>
            <p>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, declares in his word, <q>That all ſcripture is given by inſpiration of God.</q> 2 Tim. 3.16. But lo, here comes one in his name: declaring, that this part of ſcripture, the determination of the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles in the 15th chap. of the Acts; was not, by inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God. Shocking! to all that revere the bible as the book of God! For by this way of arguing, all thoſe ſcriptures, wherein the ſacred penmen uſed reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and argumentation; muſt be ſet aſide, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by inſpiration of God. Which lands us directly amongſt the chriſtian deiſts, as they are called. Thus according to this preacher, the ſcriptures are not only deficient to the neceſſary purpoſes of Chriſt's church and kingdom; but even the ſcriptures which we have, are
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013360_0021_0F90F31FD5335A58"/>in danger of being entirely invalidated. But what now would you ſay, my hearers, if this pretended patron for the Say-Brook platform; ſhould be found by his ſcheme, removing the very foundation corner ſtone of that ſame platform? The very ſuppoſition, you will doubtleſs imagine, muſt ſurely be without the leaſt foundation. But let the matter be fairly conſidered. And then, judge ye, your ownſelves, if it be not moſt glaringly manifeſt?</p>
            <p>And here, you will be pleaſed carefully to bear in mind, that leading propoſition, the grand hinge upon which the whole diſcourſe turned: That the laws of Chriſt, are not ſufficient for the government of his church. Not merely as to circumſtances of time, place, &amp;c. But not even as laws; without the addition of canon laws and rules of human deviſing. And with this full in view, be pleaſed to hear what the platform ſaith, in the confeſſion of faith. Chap. 1ſt. art. 6th. are theſe words, <q>The whole counſel of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things neceſſary for his own glory, man's ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, faith and life is either expreſsly ſet down in ſcripture, or by good and neceſſary conſequence may be deduced from ſcripture; unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of the ſpirit, or traditions of men.—There are ſome circumſtances, concerning the worſhip of God and government of the church, common to human acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſocieties, which are to be ordered by the light of nature, and chriſtian prudence, according to the general rules of the word, which are always to be obſerved.</q> Now in what ſenſe the compilers of the platform, underſtood this article, and how they meant to act in perfect conſiſtency with it, even in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to thoſe very rules which they compiled; appears from their own words; as in the preface to the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013360_0022_0F90F3207593FCF8"/>of faith. Where they expreſs themſelves thus: <q>That you be immoveably and unchangeably agreed in the only ſufficient, and invariable rule of religion; which is the holy ſcripture the fixt canon, uncapable of addition or dimunition. You ought to account nothing antient, that will not ſtand by this rule, nor any thing new that will. Do not hold yourſelves to unſcriptural rites in religion, wherein cuſtom it ſelf doth many times miſguide. Believe it to be the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of religion to reſign and captivate our wiſdom and faith to divine revelation. That you be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by this rule in the whole of religion.</q> Thus ſpake the compilers of the platform. A language as diametrically oppoſite, to that of the late preacher, as the eaſt is from the weſt. And ſo again, in the preface to the heads of agreement. They expreſs themſelves thus, <q>There is no conſtitution on earth hath ever been eſtabliſhed on ſuch ſure foundations, nor ſo fully provided for its ſubſiſtance, as the church of God, it being built on the prophets and apoſtles, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner ſtone. The wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our Lawgiver, King, and Judge, who alone hath the original ſovereignty of giving being to, and laying the foundations of the church, and whoſe only is the legiſlative power therein, hath given ſuch am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple rights and privileges to the church, and ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent rules for its government, as are inviting to ſtrangers like a city ſet on a hill.</q> Moſt excellently expreſſed. As full to our purpoſe, in direct oppoſition to the late ſermon, as words can be.</p>
            <p>Thoſe venerable fathers therefore, never meant to ſet forth any rules of church diſcipline; but ſuch only, as were in the plain ſenſe thereof, in their view, evidently contained in the ſcriptures. Even as they themſelves expreſsly declare; in this ſame preface. Saying, <q>For
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013360_0023_0F90F32131398C18"/>the healing our wounds, a more explicit aſſerting the rules of government <hi>ſufficiently</hi> provided in the holy word, hath been thought highly expedient.</q> Thus they never meant to make any new rules; but only more explicitly to ſet forth ſuch rules, as they ſuppoſed were ſufficiently provided in God's word. Whence they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed ſcripture texts to every article for the proof there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, though very impertinent to the main point; as might eaſily be made to appear. The unhappy miſtake, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which attended them about the matter was really this: That they ſuppoſed ſome things about church government, to be contained in the ſcriptures, which really are not to be found there.</p>
            <p>And ſo dubious it ſeems, did the matter appear even to themſelves, as not to imagine, they had certainly hit upon the right ſcripture plan. Whence they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the rules which they ſet forth, in the following words: <q>Hoping till it pleaſe the Lord, to ſend forth further light and truth in theſe more controverſial matters, this method may be a bleſſed means of our better unanimity,</q> &amp;c. Further light and truth they did not expect by any new revelation from heaven; but by a clearer underſtanding of that already given.</p>
            <p>Whence it appears very manifeſt, that we who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find, the ſenſe of the articles of diſcipline, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſcriptures; do act perfectly agreeable to the fundamental leading ſentiments of the compilers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, even in rejecting thoſe very articles which they compiled. And indeed upon their own principles, they muſt certainly have approved of us, as acting therein perfectly right.</p>
            <p>But it is really very queſtionable, if they would have admitted any, holding ſuch ſentiments, as ſet forth in the late ſermon; ſo much as to communion with them in any of their churches: much leſs to rank among them
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013360_0024_0F90ECAAAD9422F8"/>as a miniſter of the goſpel: For the primitive fathers of New-England, were extremely averſe to that doctrine, of the inſufficiency of the ſcriptures, as a rule of church government; held forth in the leading propoſition of ſaid ſermon. As well knowing that to be the gap, thro' which at firſt entered, and by which there was great danger of being again introduced, all the ſuperſtitions, rights and fooleries of the church of Rome. With a ſpecial view therefore, to adhere to the ſcriptures, as the only rule of faith and diſcipline, it was, that they left all the pleaſant accommodations of their native country; for this then howling wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>But how ſtrange! How marvelous ſtrange and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing! that a man of ſenſe ſhould come to us, as in the name of the Lord, publickly to reprove and rebuke this church; for rejecting a comparitively ſmall part of the Say-Brook platform! While he himſelf, at the ſame time was endeavouring, by a ſet diſcourſe, to remove the very foundation corner ſtone of that ſame platform! Yea, and to ſtrike away the main pillar; which in the view of the compilers, was deſigned to ſupport the whole! Be aſtoniſhed ye heavens, and wonder O earth at this! Let the world ſay, was there ever ſuch effron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; ſuch daring barefaced effrontery; tranſacted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore towards any church in America? If this parſon be not, for his heretical ſentiments, publickly delivered in the preſence of ſome of their own members; called to an account and chaſtiſed by the council that ſent him; let all that hear of theſe matters judge, if they do not juſtly deſerve to rank with thoſe, of whom our Lord ſaid, "ye blind guides, which ſtrain at a gnat and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a camel?"</p>
            <p>But to pave the way for our rebuke, it was very ſhrewdly noted, that the apoſtles never denied the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Jewiſh courts, before which they were
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013360_0025_0F90ECAB6DE56F78"/>called. Notably pertinent indeed! If it be conſidered, that they abſolutely denied obedience, to their unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous commands. Saying, <q>we ought to obey God ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then men.</q> On whom then, does the deſigned reproach rebound?</p>
            <p>But the ſtreſs of the reproof was laid upon this, That we renounced the conſociated connection without aſking leave. As tho' we had no right to do it, without aſking. And if no right without aſking; ſurely none without leave given. But if unſcriptural connections, ought not to be renounced, without aſking, and obtaining leave; all the proteſtant churches on earth, muſt have been to this day, in ſubjection to the Pope. For ſurely his pretended holineſs, would never have conſented to be ſo forſaken. And that for this very important reaſon: Becauſe it could not, upon his principles, be for the good of the churches.</p>
            <p>But we were rebuked for not aſking leave of them, the conſociation. And who are they? Lords over us? Yea, let all that hear thereof judge, if in their conduct towards us, they are not lording it over God's heritage?</p>
            <p>But to compleat the farce, we have been charged with breach of covenant, in renouncing connection.</p>
            <p>But was there ever any expreſs covenanting about the matter? Was not the connection practically fallen in with, merely as cuſtom led the way? And certainly then, to be practically renounced, as ſoon as found to be unſcriptural.</p>
            <p>But you have been twitted of unkindneſs, in what you have done: After all he great and good things which conſociated councils have done for you. But ſurely all thoſe ſame purpoſes, ſo far as needful, might have been done for you full as well; by congregational councils; without ever having been obnoxious to their rebuke; for adhering to the ſcriptures, or for renouncing unſcriptural connections, without aſking their leave.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:013360_0026_0F90F321F814B850"/>
But it is worthy ſpecial remark, that there were no arguments offered, nor even attempted to be offered, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to vindicate that very juridical authority; given to conſociated councils in the articles of diſcipline; with a ſpecial view to which it was, that we renounced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection. So that after all, the very eſſence of the great labouring point, was not ſo much as once pertinently touched. Our great crime therefore, of which we have been admoniſhed to repent: When we come to the bottom of the matter; conſiſts only in this, that the church were not fully agreed. A ſad calamity truly. But for which, no man had ever dared to give any rebuke in the caſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">This preacher's attempt to eſtabliſh the articles of diſcipline, not by the word of God, but upon the footing of human reaſon, brings to mind a ſaying of Luther's; who having wrote to Pope Leo the tenth thus, <q>I offer myſelf proſtrate under the feet of your holineſs, with all that I am and have, ſave me, kill me, call me, recall me, reprove me, condemn me, even as you pleaſe.—I will acknowledge your voice, the voice of Chriſt reſiding and ſpeaking in you. Here ſee men, ſaid he, in my caſe, how hard it is to riſe cut of errors generally received, and by long cuſtom become as it were natural: How true the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is, it is hard to leave cuſtoms, and cuſtom is another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And how truly Auſtine ſaith, cuſtom if it be not reſiſted will become neceſſity. I who had then ſeven years read and taught the ſcriptures moſt diligently, privately and publickly, and had ſome taſte of the knowledge of Chriſt, viz. That we were juſtified and ſaved not by works but by faith in Chriſt. And now defended publickly that the Pope is not by divine right head of the church; yet I did not ſee what naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth thence, viz. that the Pope is therefore of neceſſity of the devil; for what is not of God, is neceſſarily of the devil. I was ſo corrupted by example, and the title of holy church and cuſtom, that I granted to the Pope an human right, which if it be not underpropt with divine authority is a lie and develiſh; For we muſt obey parents and magiſtrates, not becauſe they command, but becauſe it is the will of God.</q>

If therefore any of you, my hearers, that were the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned ſubjects of that lordly rebuke, have been ready, as Iſſachars, to crouch down under the burden. You muſt needs doubtleſs begin to feel a ſecret conſciouſneſs in your own breaſts; that you have been ſhamefully faint hearted in the cauſe of Chriſt. Far from that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken conſtancy, and noble magnanimity, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes good ſoldiers of Jeſus Chriſt, the great Captain of our ſalvation. Wherefore ſeriouſly conſider what the mind and will of Chriſt really is, about theſe matters. And knowing his will, take up your croſs and follow him. And be ye ſtedfaſt and immoveable in your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and obedience to all his commands. Standing faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made you free. That overcoming all the temptations, that may be found in your way, thro' this evil world: you may finally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to ſit down with Chriſt in his throne: Even as he alſo overcame, and is ſit down with his father in his throne.</p>
            <p>As to thoſe of you, my hearers, who affect to be neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in theſe matters, it ſtands you in hand, ſeriouſly to conſider, whether it be at all probable, that the different ſchemes of church government contended for, can be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually agreeable to the mind and will of Chriſt. And if not, it muſt certainly concern you, as well as others, to ſee on which ſide the truth lies: And to embrace it with firmneſs, and to follow it with conſtancy and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. For lukewarmneſs and indifferency in matters pertaining to the kingdom of Chriſt, agree not to the character of his true and faithful diſciples and followers. But as to thoſe of you, my hearers, who are taken with a great liking to the late diſcourſe; it is a very pitiful dilemma, that you are fallen into. For if you hold by the ſcriptures, as a ſufficient rule of church government, you muſt give up the articles. And own the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013360_0028_0F905193F4798478"/>order ro be the ſcripture plan. But if with your patron, you hold to the articles of diſcipline; even tho' the ſenſe thereof be not contained in the ſcriptures. Then you muſt give up the confeſſion of faith. And even that grand pillar, the doctrine of the ſufficiency of ſcripture, as a rule of church diſcipline, upon which the venerable compilers of the platform meant to erect the whole. And ſo while you pretend a very great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for them, yet really renounce the very foundation on which they meant to build. You will not, I hope, count me your enemy becauſe I tell you the truth. My heart's deſire and prayer to God for you is, that you may be led into all truth; and that you may be perfect in all the will of God; built up in faith and holineſs; bleſſed with a part in all the bleſſings of the kingdoms of grace here. And that you and I, and all that hear me this day, may, thro' the power and grace of God in Chriſt, finally attain to the world of perfect harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, peace, and love, to the everlaſting praiſe of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name.</p>

            <head>A BRIEF VIEW Of the ſcripture texts ſubjoined to ſome of the moſt exceptionable articles in the Say-Brook platform; ſhewing them to be very impertinent to the purpoſe of conſociated connection and authority.</head>
            <p>"ARTICLES for the adminiſtration of church diſcipline, &amp;c. Say-Brook, Sept. 9, 1708." Moſt certainly it is highly reaſonable to be expected, that theſe articles compiled by ſo learned a council, ſhould be ſupported by the moſt pertinent proof to be found in the bible. But altho' this was a truly venerable council, yet as general councils have often erred, this council might very poſſibly err alſo. Whoſe decrees therefore, are not to be received with an implicit faith. But it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us freely to examine and impartially to judge every one for ourſelves, whether they are well ſupported by the ſacred ſcriptures, according to which they ought to ſtand or fall.</p>
            <p>Article 1ſt. <q>That the elder or elders of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar church, with the conſent of the brethren of the ſame, have power and ought to exerciſe church diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline according to the rules of God's word, &amp;c.</q>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:013360_0030_0F905194A32F5EB8"/>This article is ſo entirely agreeable to the heads of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ſcripture ſubjoined ſo pertinent, that there needs no ſpecial obſervations to be made upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Article 2d. That the churches, which are neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring each to other, ſhall conſociate for mutual affording to each other ſuch aſſiſtance, as may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, upon all occaſions eccleſiaſtical. And that the particular paſtors and churches, within the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive counties in this government ſhall be one conſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation (or more if they ſhall judge meet) for the end aforeſaid.</q> Pſal. 122, 3, 4, 5, and 133.8. Eccl. 4, 9, to 12. Acts 15, 2, 6, 22, 23. 1. Tim. 4, 14. 1 Cor. 16, 1. Let us ſee then the propriety of theſe texts: To prove that there ought to be ſuch a conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the churches; Pſal. 122, 3, 4, 5. <q>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem is built as a city, it is compact together; whether the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of Iſrael, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord. For there are ſet thrones of judgment; the thrones of the houſe of David.</q> Spoken in reference to the orders given under the Moſaic oeconomy, for all the tribes of Iſrael to repair to the houſe of the Lord, the temple in Jeruſalem, both for worſhip and alſo for judgment in all difficult matters. Agreeable to Deut. 16.6. and 17.8. But what is that to the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? Is it to be imagined that the thrones of judgment at Jeruſalem, were typical of, or any how pointed at the conſociation of goſpel churches; to be as thrones for all parties to repair to for judgment? No ſurely. See alſo Pſal. 133, 1. <q>Behold how good and how pleaſant it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity.</q> And is this any reaſon for the conſociation of churches? Does it not plead as pertinently for the unity of all churches, in the Biſhop of Rome the pretended vicar of Chriſt? Or may it not be as forcibly pleaded by the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013360_0031_0F90F323E62D6830"/>church of England, for the unity of all the churches in the kingdom in their hierarchy? See alſo Eccl. 4.9, to 12. <q>Two are better than one, becauſe they have a good reward of their labour: For if they fall the one will lift up his fellow: But wo unto him that is alone when he falleth, for he hath not another to help him up,</q> &amp;c. Thus the royal preacher ſets forth (in oppoſition to the nigardly miſer, of whom he had been ſpeaking) the peculiar benefit and advantage of ſocial life. But what is this to the conſociation of churches? Or at leaſt, what ſtronger plea does it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford for the combination of churches according to the articles, than according to the model of the church of England, or even the church of Rome? But let us at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Acts 15.2, 6, 22, 23. <q>When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no ſmall diſſenſion and diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with them, they determined that Paul and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas and certain others of them, ſhould go up to Jeruſalem, unto the apoſtles and elders about this queſtion.</q> (Whether the gentile converts ought to be circumciſed after the manner of Moſes.) <q>And the apoſtles and elders came together to conſider of this matter.—Then pleaſed it the apoſtles and elders with the whole church, to ſend choſen men of their own company to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas.—And wrote letters by them,</q> &amp;c. Thus the church at Antioch, in a diſſenſion that aroſe among them about circumciſion, ſent up a queſtion about that matter, by the hands of Paul and Barnabas, to the apoſtles and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that were at Jeruſalem, to be determined and ſettled by them. A queſtion of great importance, reſpecting the church of Chriſt through all generations. God therefore ſaw fit, that it ſhould be determined, not by any one, but by all the apoſtles and elders that were at Jeruſalem; whence the goſpel was to go forth unto the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013360_0032_0F90F32558BD7F00"/>nations. In the determination of which, they were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with the ſpecial aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt. "For it ſeemed good," ſaid they v. 28, <q>to the Holy Ghoſt and to us,</q> &amp;c. Thus the churches, while the apoſtles lived, looked to them to make known the mind and will of Chriſt. And now they are fallen aſleep, it is equally fitting to appeal to their writings for the deciſion of every religious controverſy. For unto the apoſtles were committed in a peculiar ſenſe, the keys of the kingdom. Math. 16.19. <q>And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou ſhall bind on earth ſhall be bound in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and whatſoever thou ſhalt looſe on earth ſhall be looſed in heaven.</q> Whereby is to be underſtood a power of binding and looſing doctrinally, i. e. by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the mind and will of Chriſt, binding upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. And agreeable hereto, <q>Jeſus breathed upon his apoſtles, and ſaid unto them, receive ye the Holy Ghoſt. Whoſoever ſins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whoſoever ſins ye retain, they are retained.</q> John 20.22, 23. Hence all the apoſtolic writings are binding upon conſcience: So as no unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired writings can be. And in the proper exerciſe of this power it was, that the apoſtles, with the elders and church at Jeruſalem, decided the queſtion ſent from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch about circumciſion. Looſing the Gentiles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, but binding them, as ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, <q>to abſtain from meats offered to idols, and from blood,</q> &amp;c. A power not to be claimed by any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſpired men, without daring preſumption. The Pope indeed, who claims as the ſucceſſor of St. Peter, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, challenges a right of determining all ſuch matters. But far be it from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. See alſo 1 Tim. 4.14. <q>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013360_0033_0F90F325C7477AC8"/>with the laying on the hands of the preſbytery.</q> Thus there was it ſeems a preſbytery concuring in the ordination of Timothy. But there may be congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal preſbyteries for that purpoſe; ſuch as officiated in all ordinations in New England previous to the Say-Brook platform. We come then to the laſt text, under this article, 1 Cor. 16.1. <q>Now concerning the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection for the ſaints as I gave order to the churches of Galatia even ſo do ye.</q> Thus St. Paul gave di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to the Corinthian church, even as he had done before to the churches of Galatia, reſpecting a collection for the ſaints. But what is this to the purpoſe of churches being conſociated? As there were churches of Galatia, ſo alſo there were churches of Connecticut without being conſociated.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Article 3. That all caſes of ſcandal, that fall out within the circuit of any of the aforeſaid conſociations, ſhall be brought to a council of the elders and alſo meſſengers of the churches within the ſaid circuit, i. e. the churches of one conſociation, if they ſee cauſe to ſend meſſengers, when there ſhall be need of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for the determination of them.</q> 3 John v. 9, 10. 1 Cor. 16.1. Gal. 6.1, 2. 2 Cor. 13.2. Acts 15.23. 2 Cor. 8.23.—Let theſe texts now be attended to. 3 John v. 9.10. <q>I wrote unto the church, but Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes who loveth to have preeminence among them, receiveth us not. Wherefore if I come, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his deeds, which he doth prating againſt us, with malicious words, and not content therewith nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he himſelf receive the brethren, and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them that would, and caſteth them out of the church.</q> There was it ſeems great diſorders in the church, to which the apoſtle had a ſpecial reference in this epiſtle; occaſioned by one Diotrephes that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted very tyrannically; whom therefore the apoſtle
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013360_0034_0F90F32683CACF58"/>threatened to correct and chaſtiſe. But what is this to the purpoſe of conſociated councils having the hearing of all caſes of ſcandal that fall out within their circuit? Are they inveſted with apoſtolic authority? None ſurely will aſſume ſuch a pretence. See alſo 1 Cor. 16.1. <q>Now concerning the collection for the ſaints, as I have given orders to the churches of Galatia, even ſo do ye.</q> Thus St. Paul gave direction to the churches of Galatia, concerning a collection. And does it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow, that conſociated councils have a right to determine all matters of ſcandal, that fall out in the churches within their diſtrict? How altogether wide of the purpoſe? The next is Gal. 6.1, 2. <q>Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, reſtore ſuch an one in the ſpirit of meekneſs, conſidering thyſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted. Bear ye one anothers burdens and ſo fulfil the laws of Chriſt.</q> Here chriſtian brethren are expreſsly directed to reſtore one another. How directly contrary then, to the natural import of this text, to go about to infer from hence, agreeable to the article, that councils have a right to hear and judge in all caſes of ſcandal? See alſo 2 Cor. 13.2. <q>I told you before and foretel you as if I were preſent the ſecond time, and being abſent, now I write to them which heretofore have ſinned, and to all others that if I come again I will not ſpare.</q> And becauſe the apoſtle determined not to ſpare ſuitable reproof, does it thence follow, that councils have a right to judge offenders? Surely nothing of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. See alſo Acts 15.23. <q>And wrote letters by them after this manner: The apoſtles and elders and brethren ſend greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch,</q> &amp;c. The apoſtles and elders ſent letters greeting, to the brethren at Antioch; but what is that to the purpoſe of councils judging caſes of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013360_0035_0F90F3274D887E28"/>ſcandal? Next we have 2 Cor. 8.23. <q>Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you, or our brethren be enquired of, they are the meſſengers of the churches and the glory of Chriſt.</q> Here we have the name of meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers applied by St. Paul to ſome that were ſent by the churches, either to collect or to carry a collection for the ſaints, of which the apoſtle was ſpeaking. But what ſhadow of relation has that to meſſengers judging in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſcandal? Tho' yet according to the following article, the elders may judge and determine as well without them.</p>
            <p>Article 4. <q>That according to the common prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of our churches nothing ſhall be deemed an act or judgment of any council, which hath not the major part of the elders preſent concuring, and ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the meſſengers preſent, as makes the majority of the council: Provided, that if any ſuch church ſhall not ſee cauſe to ſend any meſſengers to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, or the perſons choſen by them ſhall not attend, neither of theſe ſhall be any obſtruction to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the council, or invalidate any of their acts.</q> Acts 15.23. 1 Cor. 14.32, 33. Let us now ſee what relation theſe texts have to ſuch a manner of determining judgment. Acts 15.23. <q>And wrote letters by them after this manner: The apoſtles and elders and brethren ſend greeting, unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia.</q> For as ſaid in the preceding verſe <q>Then pleaſed it the apoſtles and elders with the whole church, to ſend choſen men of their own company to Antioch,</q> &amp;c. Thus the text referred to, ſpeaks of the united concurrence of a whole body. But what is this to the purpoſe, of there being ſo many meſſengers in a vote, as to make a majority of the council? The
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013360_0036_0F90ECACEEA83AA8"/>only proper inference from hence would be, that there ought to be the united concurrence of the whole. See alſo 1 Cor. 14.32, 33. <q>And the ſpirits of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are ſubject to the prophets. For God is not the author of confuſion, but of peace as in all the churches of the ſaints.</q> Thus all things are to be conducted in the church, in an orderly manner. But what is this to the purpoſe of determining judgment ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the article? Can there be no order in the caſe, but by a major part of the elders, and ſo many meſſengers as to make a majority of the whole?</p>
            <p>Article 5. <q>That when any caſe is orderly brought before any council of the churches, it ſhall there be heard and determined, which (unleſs orderly removed from thence) ſhall be a final iſſue, and all parties therein concerned ſhall ſit down, and be determined thereby. And the council ſo hearing, and giving the reſult or final iſſue, in the ſaid caſe as aforeſaid, ſhall ſee their determination, or judgment duly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and attended, in ſuch way and manner, as ſhall in their judgment be moſt ſuitable and agreeable to the word of God.</q> Acts 15. 1 Cor. 5.5. 2 Cor. 2.6, 11, and 13.2. Phil. 3.15. Rom. 14.2, 3.</p>
            <p>In this we have the quinteſſence of the matter, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the juridical authority of councils: Here the grand canon is erected. Here therefore the cleareſt proof is to be expected. Let theſe texts therefore be carefully attended to. Acts 15. Refering to the whole chapter, which as to the eſſentials of it, has been conſidered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, under the 2d article. And there ſhown to have no manner of relation to ordinary councils judging in caſes of ſcandal. See then 1 Cor. 5.5. <q>To deliver ſuch an one unto Satan for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</q> Here the church at Corinth, were directed
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013360_0037_0F90F327F2537410"/>to caſt out one of their own diſorderly members; which is altogether beſide, yea even directly counter to, the purpoſe of juridical judgment to be given by a council. See then 2 Cor. 2.6, 11. <q>Sufficient to ſuch a man is this puniſhment which was inflicted of many. Leſt Satan ſhould get an advantage of us, for we are not ignorant of his devices.</q> Plainly intimating, that the puniſhment inflicted upon the inceſtuous Corinthian, was done by the mutual concurrence of the many bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of that particular church. But who can imagine that to be in any wiſe to the purpoſe of councils paſſing a juridical judgment upon offenders? It would ſurely be much more pertinent hence to infer, that conſociated councils have no concern in ſuch matters. See alſo 2 Cor. 13.2. <q>I told you before, and foretel you as if I were preſent the 2d time, and being abſent, now I write to them which heretofore have ſinned and to all other, that if I come again I will not ſpare.</q> i. e. The apoſtle would not ſpare ſuitable reproof and rebuke to them that had ſinned. But what is that to the juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical judgment of councils? It is ſurely quite off the purpoſe. See alſo Phil. 3.15. <q>Let us therefore as many as be perfect, be thus minded: And if in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even this unto you.</q> Thus St. Paul, profeſſing for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as in the preceeding verſe, <q>to forget the things which are behind, to reach and preſs forward towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt.</q> Here exhorts all that are perfect in the chriſtian profeſſion, to be thus practically minded, in the diligent purſuit of the glorious prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt. As far from the purpoſe of juridical judgment, as the eaſt is from the weſt. Attend then to Rom. 14.2.3. <q>For one believeth that he may eat all things, another who is weak eateth herbs. Let
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013360_0038_0F90ECADAE544A60"/>him that eateth deſpiſe him that eateth not, and let not him which eateth not, judge him that eateth, for God hath received him.</q> But what is this to the purpoſe? Except it be to intimate that after all, this claim of juridical power, is a matter of as real indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as that of eating or not eating herbs? Which yet in truth it is not, unleſs more countenance can be found for it in the ſcriptures, than is contained in the texts here cited.</p>
            <p>Article 6. <q>That, if any paſtor and church doth obſtinately refuſe a due attendance and conformity to the determination of the council, that hath cognizance of the caſe, and determineth it as above, after due pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience uſed, they ſhall be reputed guilty of ſcandalous contempt, and dealt with as the rule of God's word in ſuch caſes doth provide, and the ſentence of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communion ſhall be declared againſt ſuch paſtor and church. And the churches are to approve of the ſaid ſentence, by withdrawing from the communion of the paſtor and church, which ſo refuſed to be healed.</q> Rom. 16.17. Mat. 18.15, 16, 17. by proportion Gal. 2.11. to 14. 2 Theſ. 3.6, 14.</p>
            <p>Let theſe texts now be attended to: Rom. 16.17. Now <q>I beſeech you, brethren, mark them which cauſe diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.</q> Here St. Paul beſeeches the brethren, called to be ſaints in the church at Rome, to mark and avoid ſuch among themſelves, as walked contrary to the goſpel; which has plainly no manner of relation to councils in any reſpect. Mat. 18.15, 16, 17. <q>Moreover if thy brother ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone; if he ſhall hear thee, thou haſt gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013360_0039_0F90F32941360730"/>every word be eſtabliſhed. And if he ſhall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church; but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.</q> Here we have a plain direction given by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for every particular church, to caſt out their own members refuſing to hear them; which teaches nothing about conſociated coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils declaring ſentence of noncommunion, againſt ſuch paſtor and church as refuſe ſubjection to their decrees. The following texts, are ſaid to be by proportion, i. e. like reaſon. Gal. 2.11. to 14. <q>But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withſtood him to the face, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was to be blamed. For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles, but when they were come he withdrew, and ſeperated himſelf, fearing them which were of the circumciſion. And the other Jews diſſembled likewiſe with him; inſomuch that Barnabas alſo was carried away with their diſſimulation. But when I ſaw that they walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the goſpel, I ſaid unto Peter before them all, if thou, being a Jew, liveſt after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compeleſt thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</q> Here Paul reproved Peter a prevaricating kind of conduct, relative to the Jewiſh rites. But it does not appear, either that Paul inſiſted upon, or that Peter made any acknowledgment in the caſe. And yet neither is there the leaſt intimation, that Paul denounced ſentence of noncommunion againſt Peter. What ſhadow of proportion therefore there is in the caſe, is not to be imagined; except it be in Peter's withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſeparating himſelf from the Gentiles: The very thing for which he was to be blamed. But further by proportion, ſee 2 Theſ. 3.6, 14. <q>Now we command you brethren in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013360_0040_0F90F329DDED1260"/>that ye withdraw yourſelves from every brother that walketh diſorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us. And if any man obey not our word by this epiſtle, note that man and have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with him, that he may be aſhamed.</q> Here the brethren of the Theſſalonian church, were expreſsly commanded to withdraw themſelves, from every bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theirs that walked diſorderly, in diſobedience to the apoſtolic word. Whence by plain proportion, it appears to be the duty of every particular church, to put away all ſuch as walk diſorderly; in diſobedience to the word of truth. Which has no manner of relation to a council's declaring ſentence of non communion with a paſtor and church. And it is ſurely very unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that arguments by proportion, ſhould be ſo far fetched in ſuch weighty matters.</p>
            <p>But now as theſe texts, ſubjoined to the ſeveral arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that have been conſidered, are in no wiſe applicable to the proof and ſupport thereof, it may fairly be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, the bible affords none at all to that purpoſe. It is quite needleſs therefore, to proceed upon the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing articles: Becauſe if theſe that have been conſidered, are void of ſcripture ſupport; theſe which are the main pillars, being left without any ſcripture foundation, muſt inevitably fall: And of conſequence the whole building tumble to ruin; and great will be the fall of it. And when once the emoluments annexed, are as thoroughly removed as the ſcriptures are from its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, very ſudden alſo will be the fall thereof.</p>
            <p>It is obvious to any careful obſerver, that a conſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated council convened according to platform, thereby becomes a body inveſted with ſuch horns of power, as that whetherſoever the body moves, thither the horns move alſo, inforcing their every act, judgment, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, opinion, or advice with binding authority. Which
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:013360_0041_0F90F32B4FE61950"/>being an unſcriptural body, ought not therefore to be joined with, in any caſe whatever.—The princes of this world indeed, have fought in almoſt all ages, to model the religion of the ſtate to the civil polity. For a ſtate religion has generally been deemed needful, even by heathen as well as by chriſtian ſtates. And indeed in ſome reſpects, much more reaſonably by heathens than by chriſtians. Becauſe to the heathens, it ſeemed a very plauſible maxim, that every ſtate had a right to model religion as they pleaſed; and of conſequence, that all the various members in particular, ought to be ſubject to the model which the ſtate enjoyned. Whereas by divine revelation, religion is become a certain fixed and determinate matter: In no wiſe pliable to the devices of human policy, but abſolutely binding upon every man's conſcience, according to what God himſelf hath enjoined. And therefore every individual, hath an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragible right to ſee and judge for himſelf. And yet even chriſtian ſtates, have more generally been endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, to accommodate the modes of religion to the model of civil polity. Mr. Bowers in his hiſtory of the Popes writes thus, <q>The new form of government in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced (by Conſtantine the firſt chriſtian Emperor) into the ſtate, ſerved as a model for the government of the church. That during the three firſt centuries, each church was in a manner independant (for then paganiſm was the ſtate religion) but in the fourth and following ages, great alterations were made in both, (church and ſtate) the church adapting her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to that of the ſtate.</q> So alſo the hierarchy of the church of England, is adapted to the model of the civil monarchy. But whether there be not in ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical forms of religion, deſignedly adapted to the model of the civil ſtate, ſomething more than a mere diſtant reſemblance of the image of the beaſt, that goeth into
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013360_0042_0F90F32BC5C76A78"/>perdition; deſerves a very ſerious conſideration. As alſo, whether the model of church government ſet forth in the Say-Brook articles, be not in ſome meaſure framed in coherence with the model of the civil government? And whether ſo far conſequently, it muſt not partake of the ſame kind of obnoxiouſneſs to the juſt vengeance of heaven; with all other political models of religion? For every mode introduced into religion, aſide from the ſcripture rule, muſt needs be at beſt, ſuch wood, hay, and ſtubble as ſhall ſurely be burnt up. <q>Happy is he that condemneth not himſelf in that thing which he alloweth. And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, becauſe he eateth not of faith; for whatſoever is not of faith, is ſin.</q> Whoſoever therefore ſubmits to any model of church government, which Chriſt hath not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, had need ſee to it in earneſt, how he will anſwer it to his great Judge, who will ſhortly <hi>be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels; in flaming fire taking ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on them that know not God, and that obey not the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>I take it for granted, (ſaith an elegant writer<note n="*" place="bottom">Gent. Mag. July <hi>1772.</hi>
                  </note>) that the religion of a chriſtian lies in the new teſtament; <hi>that</hi> is the great charter of our ſalvation, and it is fully and completely ſufficient for that purpoſe.—The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions of <hi>ſynods, councils, convocations,</hi> or <hi>aſſemblies</hi> of divines, are nothing to us, can be of no force or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, nor of the leaſt importance to us as chriſtians, otherwiſe than as they are found, upon a candid exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to agree with this rule.—Upon this <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> namely, <hi>the ſufficiency of the ſcriptures,</hi> and <hi>the right of private judgment,</hi> the proteſtant cauſe is built.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:013360_0043_0F90F32C9AE519F0"/>The command of our Lord is not,—Search the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the rabbies and doctors of the law, or the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the elders, but <hi>ſearch the ſcriptures for they teſtify of me.</hi>—An attempt to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> religion by law, is a weak and vain attempt, and argues great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the nature of <hi>true religion;</hi> neither can it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have any other effect than to make men hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. —In all the new teſtament, the <hi>magiſtrate</hi> has no <hi>power or authority</hi> in matters of religion delegated to him.—His buſineſs lies only with the civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of mankind; and when he goes beyond this, or attempts to interfere with the faith of chriſtians, he meddles with things out of his proper ſphere, and moſt certainly infringes upon the prerogative and authority of the great Lawgiver and head of the church; it is, in fact, an attempt to <hi>wreſt the ſceptre out of his hand, and deprive him of his kingdom.</hi> The caſe is the very ſame, whether this power is uſurped by the <hi>Pope of Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Primate of England;</hi> by <hi>the convocation of the clergy, or an aſſembly of divines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>church of Chriſt</hi> ſtands upon a firmer baſis than the authority of the civil magiſtrate, the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of councils, or any human authority or power whatſoever, even upon the authority of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe kingdom is not of this world,</hi> neither ſubject to the law of it, but is purely of a ſpiritual nature.— And to ſpeak of the church of Rome, the church of England, the church of Scotland, or any particular community of Chriſtians, as a <hi>church,</hi> diſtinguiſhed by any <hi>peculiar eſtabliſhment,</hi> diſtinct from, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of, the ſole authority of Jeſus, is unſcriptural and antichriſtian.—The <hi>church of Chriſt</hi> is not, cannot, be in <hi>danger</hi> from the ſevereſt attacks of its greateſt enemies. <hi>Eſtabliſhments of men</hi> may be, and often are in <hi>danger—in great drnger</hi> of being overturned;
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:013360_0044_0F90F32D3406F458"/>and thoſe, who get their wealth by the craft of them, may cry out for fear leſt they ſhould be buried under the ruins, or elſe, like the ſhrine-makers at <hi>Epheſus</hi> loſe their trade, and conſequently their profit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Such, no doubt, think they do well to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, becauſe they have ſo much at ſtake, when men of more honeſt and liberal ſpirits point out to others, the <hi>ſhallow foundation</hi> upon which ſuch eſtabliſhments are built; and great art has been often uſed, and pains taken, to impoſe upon the reaſon and ſenſes of mankind, by making them believe that ſuch <hi>eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> are the <hi>true church of Chriſt,</hi> and they have in too many inſtances ſucceeded; but the members of Chriſt's true church know, or ſhould know, that <hi>the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure,</hi> and never can be in danger from the rudeſt ſhocks.—To any perſon, who views it without prejudice, it will appear ſtronger and ſtronger, more beautiful and excellent, the more it is examined; it will appear to be a <hi>building of God, a houſe not made with hands,</hi> begun on earth by almighty power, ſupported by his never failing energy, and ſhall be complete and eternal in the heavens.—<hi>When the ranſomed of the Lord ſhall return and come to Zion with ſongs, and everlaſting joy ſhall be upon their heads; they ſhall obtain joy and gladneſs, and ſorrow and ſighing ſhall fly away for ever.</hi>

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <head type="sub">In which an account is given of the eſſential facts, relative to the conduct of the conſociated council, towards the paſtor and firſt church of Chriſt in Newtown.</head>
            <p>IN July, A. D. 1770, the paſtor of ſaid church pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly declared, that he renounced that part of Say-Brook platform, intitled, Articles for the adminiſtration of church diſcipline: as not being in his view, in the main thing therein aimed at, agreeable to the goſpel: And that if the church choſe to take that for their rule of diſcipline, and in the caſe impending, call in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which is a ſuitable political expedient for ſuch churches, as cannot be agreed among themſelves, about the ſcripture plan of diſcipline; he would freely reſign the work of the miniſtry among them; who joined conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated councils no more. For which he gave his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in public print.</p>
            <p>With difficulty the church choſe a meſſenger once afterwards to attend a conſociated council. In the mean time the paſtor had a friendly conference with two aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations on that ſubject. And at a church meeting,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:013360_0046_0F90F32E039B04F8"/>Aug. 16, A. D. 1773, it was propoſed, whether this church mean to ſtand in the conſociated connection ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Say-Brook platform or not? Voted in the negative. But as ſome manifeſted a diſſatisfaction with ſaid vote; upon their deſire another meeting was ſoon after warned to reconſider the matter; and the Rev. Mr. Bartlet deſired to preach upon that occaſion. At a church meeting, Sept. 25, A. D, 1773. The Rev. Mr. Bartlet being preſent, was at the motion of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, deſired by a vote of the church to officiate as moderator.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propoſed,</hi> Whether it be the mind of this church to ſtand in the conſociated connection according to Say-Brook platform or not? Voted in the negative.</p>
            <p>At a <hi>ſociety</hi> meeting alſo, ſoon after called for that purpoſe: Propoſed, Whether the ſociety would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with the vote of the church renouncing conſociated connection? Voted in the affirmative.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propoſed alſo,</hi> Whether the ſociety would chuſe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to call a council? Voted in the negative, very few it is ſaid being on the affirmative ſide.</p>
            <p>But a conſiderable number of individuals, according to common report, afterwards ſigned a petition to the aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for their counſel &amp; advice; which was preſented to the aſſociation at Ripton, after the council was adjourned. At a church meeting, Oct. 20, A. D. 1773, was read a circular letter from the church of Chriſt at Ripton, deſiring the aſſiſtance of this church by their paſtor and meſſenger in ordaining a paſtor over them; and Major John Chandler was choſen to attend on that occaſion. And when the ordaining council at Ripton was about to form, ſaid paſtor and meſſenger being preſent, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that he, ſaid paſtor and their church had renounced the conſociated connection according to Say-Brook platform: And deſired therefore to know, if the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:013360_0047_0F90ECAF2FBD7750"/>meant to act in the conſociated form? For if ſo, they could not conſiſtently join them. And as ſome of the leading members inſiſted, they were called to be a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of, and meant to act in that form; ſaid paſtor and meſſenger refuſed to join them; but continued preſent until the next evening. And no enquiries were made of the reaſons of their conduct: But the next week, was delivered to ſaid paſtor, the following notification:</p>

                  <p>PERCEIVING by the notification ſent by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil from Ripton, to me and to the church under my
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:013360_0048_0F90F32F70015A38"/>care, ſigned Robert Roſs, moderator, that the council have taken in hand, authoritatively to call me and my church to an account, for renouncing the conſociated connection. And to reclaim us, as having already judged that we have done amiſs and ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed. Theſe are therefore to inform you, though doubtleſs well knowing to it before, that years ſince I have publickly diſclaimed and renounced the juridical authority of conſociated councils; as ſet forth in the Say-Brook articles of church diſcipline. For which I have given my reaſons in public print, to which no fair reply hath been made. And have, as deſired in a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian manner, by the conſociation, held a friendly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference once and again with the aſſociation on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; by whom I never yet could perceive any ſufficient reaſons offered, to convince me of an error in that matter; nor even to perſuade me, as they themſelves ſeemed inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chiefly to plead, that there was no very great or eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al difference, but am rather more &amp; more firmly perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the more I conſider and weigh the ſubject, that the ſaid conſociated connection and authority is entirely void of any warrant, either by precept or example from the ſacred oracles, by which my conſcience is entirely bound in matters pertaining to Chriſt's church and kingdom: Whereby I am in duty holden to reject all ſuch eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical claims, as Chriſt hath given no warrant for in his word, as being of an antichriſtian nature. And when one of the Rev. elders of your own body was preſent at one of our church meetings, and by the deſire of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, choſen moderator thereof; at which meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſociated connection was a ſecond time fairly voted out; ſaid moderator, was by ſome of the leading members repeatedly and earneſtly urged, to produce ſcripture warrant, if there was any, for the ſupport of the conſociated claims; that we might thereby, if we
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:013360_0049_0F905195663DB410"/>had done amiſs, be reclaimed; but could be moved to no attempts to that purpoſe, nor had any thing to object, but that we had a right to paſs ſuch a vote as we did, under his guidance as moderator.</p>
                  <p>And that now after all this, the conſociation ſhould take upon them juridically to reclaim us, I ſhall freely ſubmit to the publick to judge, whether it be not in fact a very ſtrange and unaccountable attempt. Wherefore tho' I am ready to pay all due deference to you, as Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and freely to render to you as Chriſtians, if deſired, merely as ſuch, ſtill further reaſons reſpecting this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet as I cannot but look upon the juridical mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures now taken by the conſociation, to be of ſuch an antiſcriptural nature, as juſtly to deſerve an entire diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. I am bold therefore to declare in the face of the world, that I cannot ſubmit thereunto; however I may be neceſſitated to ſuffer undeſirable conſequences. But leaving all events to the righteous Governor of the world, and praying that we may all be led in ways of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and truth. I remain, Gentlemen,</p>

            <p>At a church meeting in Newtown, Nov. 17, A. D. 1773, propoſed, whether agreeable to this church to concur with their paſtor in the above written, as a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble return to be made by him, to the committee of the conſociation, in reply to their notification to us, dated at Ripton, Oct. 27, 1773, ſigned Robert Roſs, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator? Voted in the affirmative. Having in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of that liberty to which we have a juſt right as men and as chriſtians, renounced the conſociated connection, from a real conviction, that the authority annexed thereto, by the articles of church diſcipline in the Say-Brook platform, is without any grounds for its ſupport, either precept or example in the goſpel; and therefore
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:013360_0050_0F90519629F2E058"/>in point of duty juſtly to be rejected. And as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation have, is the exerciſe of that ſame authority, which we in obedience to God have renounced, taken upon them to reclaim us, as being already prejudged guilty by them; as appears by their notification to us, dated Ripton, Oct. 27, A. D. 1773, ſigned Robert Roſs, moderator. We therefore, cannot look upon ourſelves under any obligations, either in point of duty or even of good manners, to pay any kind of obediential regard, to ſuch unſcriptural, uſurped authority over us. Tho' yet we ſtand ready to render unto them and to all others aſking merely as chriſtians, the reaſons of our proceed-dure; even as we have herein already briefly done.</p>
            <p>At a church meeting in Newtown, Nov. 17, A. D. 1773, propoſed, whether agreeable to the minds of this church, that the above written be preſented to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the conſociation, as as ſuitable return to be made by this church, to their notification, dated Rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Oct. 27, 1773? Voted with the concurrence of their paſtor, in the affirmative.</p>
            <p>The committee met according to appointment, and ſent to ſaid paſtor to deſire his company or to appoint a time and place for a conference together. When the preceeding votes of the church were ſent in to them, with a line ſignifying that he would be very willing to wait upon them at his own houſe when they pleaſed; which they did the next morning, and matters relative to their buſineſs freely converſed upon. In the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon was that ſermon preached, which was the occaſion of the preceeding reply. The council met according to adjournment, but gave out no reſult. The Rev. Mr. Baldwin preached, and gave a very ſeaſonable word of exhortation, from Phi. 4.2. The aſſociation took into conſideration, a memorial that had been preſented, ſigned by a number of the church and ſociety, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:013360_0051_0F905196E936A4D8"/>that the paſtor and church had gone off from the foundation on which he was ſettled, praying their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and advice; which they gave out in the following form:</p>

                     <hi>An aſſociation of the eaſtern diſtrict of Fairfield county, met according to adjournment, at the houſe of Dr. Thomas, in Newtown.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE aſſociation having carefully attended to the memorial from the aggrieved members of the church of Newtown, and heard what they had further to urge relative to their grievances; and having like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe heard what the paſtor and thoſe of the majority of the church ſaw fit to reply.—Feel deeply affected with the melancholy ſituation of the church, and the great danger of a laſting diviſion therein. Which they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend would be of fatal conſequence to both ſides. Are therefore of opinion, that all lawful meaſures ſhould be tried, to keep the church if poſſible from a diviſion, and think that under the preſent circumſtances of this place, 'tis eſpecially incumbent on both ſides to be of a moderate yielding diſpoſition; and to give up every thing they can conſiſtent with a good conſcience for the ſake of peace. We would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore earneſtly recommend it to the church and ſociety to reconſider their votes, by which they have renounced their conſociated connection with the neighbouring churches; and thereby relieve the conſociation from the diſagreeable neceſſity of renouncing all further connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with, and watchful care over the church of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town. We deſire they would conſider, whether the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to that vote, will not lay them under many diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable inconveniencies? And whether it will not in all probability be productive of a diviſion of the church? In the almoſt fatal conſequences of which, they that adhere to the vote, as well as the others muſt
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:013360_0052_0F90F32F94AB07E8"/>deeply ſhare. We would earneſtly recommend it to the Rev. Mr. Judſon, to conſider how far he can go, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violating thoſe principles in church government, which he thinks himſelf obliged in conſcience to adopt and act agreeable to, in order to reſtore peace to this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided church. Would the Rev. Mr. Judſon be willing to continue in connection with the neighbouring church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, attend their aſſociations and conſociations, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to act, when they find themſelves under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of acting deciſively, (which is but ſeldom the caſe) we apprehend would make no breach between the conſociation, and the paſtor and church here. We heartily wiſh the Rev. Mr. Judſon might continue his paſtoral relation to this church, if it may be without making a ſchiſm in the body. But unleſs Mr. Judſon and the church and ſociety can be prevailed upon to comply with the above advice, we are very doubtful whether this can be the caſe. If Mr. Judſon thinks he cannot comply thus, we would ſtill urge it upon the church and ſociety to reſcind their votes reſpecting conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciational connection. And would adviſe the Rev. Mr. Judſon to reſign his paſtoral office (as he has manifeſted his willingneſs to do) in caſe the majority of the ſociety and church ſhould be willing to continue in conſociated connection with the churches of this diſtrict. We would alſo obſerve to the church here, that we apprehend they imagine, the power of councils upon the Say-Brook platform to be greater than really it is: Beſure greater than what is claimed by this conſociation. As we do not ſuppoſe but that every church will judge, whether they will receive the deciſions of a council. And that their obſtinate refuſal expoſes them only to a ſentence of noncommunion in conſociational connection; unleſs there be ſcandalous immorality or damnable hereſy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by the church; in which caſe congregational
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:013360_0053_0F90F33042BFC7F8"/>churches at large, or even independent churches, muſt renounce communion with ſuch a church in all goſpel ordinances, leſt by ſuch a communion they be partakers of their ſin. We hope if theſe things are duly conſidered, the church and ſociety will be willing ſtill to continue their conſociational connection. In caſe this advice be complied with, we adviſe thoſe brethren that have been aggrieved with the conduct of the paſtor and church, cheerfully to continue in the communion of the church, and to baniſh from their minds all hard thoughts and jealouſies, they have entertained of their paſtor and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. And we do exhort theſe brethren freely to meet with their paſtor and brethren, to converſe with them upon their unhappy difficulties, to labour to effect a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation upon the plan here propoſed. But in caſe the above advice ſhould be wholly rejected by the church and ſociety, we would yet adviſe the aggrieved brethren not to ſhun free converſation with the other, to ſee if they cannot come into ſome plan, in which they can with a good conſcience continue in communion toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For as we look upon it that a diviſion of the church and ſociety, would be attended with the moſt fatal conſequences, we can not adviſe to it, unleſs abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary. But if after all theſe meaſures have been taken, the aggrieved brethren think themſelves bound in conſcience to diſcontinue their communion with the other part of the church, we adviſe that they lay their grievances before a conſociated council of this diſtrict, to conſider what relief it may be proper to grant them under their unhappy circumſtances. In the mean time we would adviſe them by all means ſteadily to attend to Mr. Judſon's preaching, and by no means neglect attending public worſhip at the meeting-houſe, till ſuch time as they have the direction of the conſociation in this affair.</p>

            <p>Purſuant to the above advice, a ſociety meeting was holden in Newtown, Jan. 12, A. D. 1774, propoſed for vote, whether this meeting will agree, in matters of difficulty to call a council to adviſe and act with the ſociety and church, and vote with them in all ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult caſes; and that this vote be preferred to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for their approbation.<note n="§" place="bottom">This vote, as ſome Gentlemen very ſafely ſay, is what it is.—See note page <hi>19.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Voted in the affirmative.</p>
            <p>Thus far, and no farther have matters hitherto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. Upon the proceedings of the council and aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, it is to be obſerved, that we hear never a word of counſel, direction or advice, by them given to the minor party, to endeavour to fall in quietly and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with the majority of the church and ſociety in their votes; as a matter of right, that ought to govern in all communities, even as a thing eſſential to the orderly ſubſiſtance of every community; excepting where the rights of conſcience are violated. But few or none even of the council themſelves, it is preſumed, would ſay, but that with a good conſcience, they could join in mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip with a congregational church, were their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling fixed with ſuch. Whereas had the council, from the beginning of clamorous complaints thrown in before them, urged advice of ſuch a nature, inſtead of giving directions and going into meaſures, which tended greatly to ſtrengthen and encourage riſing oppoſition, but to terrify the feeble minded of the major party; no unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced perſon, that knows how theſe matters have been
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:013360_0055_0F905197A429CC18"/>agitated from the beginning, can entertain a rational doubt, but that this church with their paſtor would ere now, have been in peace and quietneſs; a few individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als excepted. But of the chriſtian propriety of ſuch proceedings, it is freely ſubmitted to the public to judge for themſelves.</p>
