            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE SERMON on the <hi>holy rite</hi> of CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIRMATION, was delivered in New-York, in Saint George's chapel, on Sunday May the 4th inſt. and (with a little variation) in the afternoon of that day, in Saint Paul's chapel.</p>
            <p>This ſacred rite was adminiſtered in the firſt mentioned of theſe chapels, on Sunday, April the 27th laſt, and in the other chapel, the day the ſermon was preached.

            <p>SERIOUS is the truth, that thoſe who enjoy the greateſt ſpiritual privileges, are not always the moſt diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the practice of virtue!</p>
            <p>How highly favoured, for inſtance, were the people of Iſrael?—"Unto them," it is ſaid, "pertained the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the glory; and the covenants; and the giving of the law; and the ſervice of God; and the promiſes."<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Rom. ix. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But were they, in general, obedient to the will of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? How often did the Almighty complain of their impieties?</p>
            <p>"I have ſpread out my hands," ſaid he, "all the day, unto a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts; who provoke me to anger continually to my face."<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Iſai. lxv. 2, 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>"This people of Jeruſalem is ſlidden back with a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual backſliding; they hold faſt deceit; they refuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. I hearkened and heared, but they ſpake not aright. No man repented him of his wickedneſs, ſaying, What have I done? Every one turned to his courſe, as the horſe ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the battle."<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Jer. viii. 5, 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:021347_0005_0FB31BCC9CF45A80"/>Often did God inflict judgments on his people to reclaim them from vice; and often, to accompliſh this end, did he addreſs them in language of threatning and reproof, by the voice of his prophets.</p>
            <p>In the chapter before us, this people were thus addreſſed by the prophet Micah.</p>
            <p>"Hear ye now what the Lord ſaith: Ariſe, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice!"</p>
            <p>Or, as the ſenſe is; plead openly, vehemently; let there be witneſſes to hear the caſe, which is ſo favourable on God's part, and ſo full againſt his people, that the very mountains and hills, on which they have publickly ſinned againſt him, and on which he greatly bleſſed them, had they eyes to ſee, ears to hear, and a voice of utterance, would teſtify that God planted them with vines and olives; cloathed them with graſs and flocks; ſtored them with ſprings of water, and beautified them with cedars and all pleaſant trees of the foreſt;—but on theſe places have theſe people made their groves; ſet up their idols; ſacrificed to devils, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted impieties not to be named! Speak, therefore, O Micah, as though thou wouldeſt make the mountains and hills hear, that they may witneſs for God againſt this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple!</p>
            <p>"Hear ye, O mountains, the Lord's controverſy, and ye ſtrong foundations of the earth; for the Lord hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy with his people, and he will plead with Iſrael;"— no longer forbear to puniſh them for their iniquities.—"O my people, what have I done unto thee? And wherein have I wearied thee? Teſtify againſt me!"—If I have ever been doing thee good; if I have impoſed on thee nothing griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nor unjuſt, why art thou weary of me? Or, if thou haſt found any injuſtice in me, heſitate not to declare it; witneſs againſt me!</p>
            <p>The Almighty then recounted the favors he had conferred on the people of Iſrael, and, particularly, the deliverance he gave them from Egyptian bondage, and from their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, while paſſing through the wilderneſs to the land of Canaan; and alſo, the inſtruction communicated to them by Moſes.</p>
            <p>This addreſs of the prophet, ſeems to have awakened in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021347_0006_0FB31BCD99F4E9A8"/>
the people a ſenſe of guilt; a diſpoſition to return to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. They enquire what ſacrifice they ſhall render God as an atonement for their ſins; and expreſs their willingneſs to offer the <hi>moſt coſtly</hi> in their power;—even the lives of <hi>their</hi> CHILDREN, if <hi>theſe</hi> to God would be acceptable.</p>
            <p>"Wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord and bow my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?—Will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of rams? Or with ten thouſands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firſt-born for my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; the fruit of my body for the ſin of my ſoul?"</p>
            <p>To theſe enquiries, the prophet anſwers in the words of our text.—"He HATH ſhewed thee, O Man! what is GOOD. And what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly; and to love mercy; and to walk humbly with thy God?"</p>
            <p>The Almighty, it is here ſaid, HAD SHEWED the people of Iſrael "what was GOOD;" or what was their DUTY.— It is probable the prophet alluded to the following paſſage in the tenth chapter of the book of Deuteronomy, wherein the duty of men is expreſſed.</p>
            <p>"And now Iſrael, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God; to walk in all his ways; and to love him; and to ſerve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy ſoul: To keep the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Lord, and his ſtatutes, which I command thee this day, for thy good?"<note n="(e)" place="bottom">Deut. x. 12, 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There are many other paſſages, indeed, in the ſacred writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in which the whole of our duty is declared. And the children of Iſrael were informed, in the text, that all their ſacrifices to God would be unacceptable to him, if they were <hi>regardleſs</hi> of VIRTUE.</p>
            <p>"What doth the Lord require of thee but to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" Or, what ſervice canſt thou render him, that will be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, whilſt thou doſt not obey his will?</p>
            <p>"Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt-offerings and ſacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:021347_0007_0FB31BCF93BA2FA8"/>
obey is better than ſacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams!"<note n="(f)" place="bottom">1 Sam. xv. 22.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As ſacrifice, or external worſhip, is not pleaſing to God, unleſs we are poſſeſſed of righteouſneſs;—and as the WHOLE of our duty conſiſts, it is ſaid, in "doing juſtice; loving mercy, and walking humbly with God;" we beg leave to pay a little attention to theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>It cannot be ſaid we "DO JUSTLY," if, in any ſort, we <hi>injure</hi> our <hi>fellow creatures.</hi> And, in how many reſpects, may they be injured?</p>
            <p>They may be robbed of their VIRTUE, which is, of all things, the moſt eſtimable.</p>
            <p>They may be deprived of their REPUTATION; be pierced by the tongue of detraction, and receive thereby a wound more injurious than death itſelf.</p>
            <p>By artifice, fraud or power, they may be diveſted of their PROPERTY; and, by the hand of violence, they may be <hi>maimed</hi> in their PERSONS, or <hi>deprived</hi> of LIFE.</p>
            <p>It cannot be ſaid, that we "DO JUSTLY," if we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of the duty we owe to <hi>our</hi> COUNTRY, by duly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring IT'S LAWS.</p>
            <p>Public juſtice is explicitly enjoined on us. We are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired "to render unto all their dues; tribute to whom tribute is due; cuſtom to whom cuſtom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor."<note n="(g)" place="bottom">Rom. xiii. 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can it be ſaid that we "DO JUSTLY," while we perform not <hi>all</hi> the <hi>relative duties</hi> we owe to <hi>each other.</hi> What injuſtice may legiſlators, magiſtrates, miniſters of religion, parents, and divers other characters, be chargeable with, when they are inattentive to the diſcharge of the truſt repoſed in them?</p>
            <p>We do not, indeed, properly revere this precept of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, except we "do unto all men, as we would they ſhould do unto us;" <note n="(h)" place="bottom">Luke vi. 31.</note> or unleſs all our actions, towards each other, are governed by the principles of uprightneſs and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There is not, we conceive, any virtue that ſo contributes
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021347_0008_0FB31BD150E47298"/>
to the happineſs of ſociety, as JUSTICE. And it is no ſmall teſtimony, in favor of our religion, that JUSTICE, as well as MERCY, is ſo forcibly and repeatedly enjoined on us.</p>

            <p>But however becoming humility is to mankind; and how pleaſing ſoever our humble demeanor may be to God, we cannot conclude that he requires of us nothing more than the virtue of humility, when he enjoins us to "walk humbly with him."</p>
            <p>JUSTICE, MERCY, and HUMILITY, are, indeed, <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal virtues;</hi> but ſhould they, (in the common acceptation of the words) be poſſeſſed by us, we might, notwithſtanding, be <hi>defective</hi> in <hi>our duty;</hi> be the ſlaves of vice; polluted by ſin; devoid of the Almighty's affection.</p>

            <p>WITHOUT attending to that important relation which theſe words have with the context, we will conſider in <hi>what ſenſe</hi> Saint Paul was "<hi>alive</hi> without the law."</p>
            <p>NEXT, ſhew, what we are to underſtand by the "<hi>coming</hi> of the <hi>commandment</hi>" to him.</p>
            <p>And, laſtly, the <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>this</hi> to our apoſtle;—"Sin revived, and he died."</p>
            <p>FIRST, we are to notice in <hi>what ſenſe</hi> Saint Paul "was <hi>alive</hi> without the law once."</p>
            <p>There were three kinds of laws which the Almighty deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the people of Iſrael.—The <hi>ceremonial law,</hi> which preſcribed the rituals of their religion;—the <hi>judicial law,</hi> by which juſtice was adminiſtered among them,—and that law which is <hi>ſtiled moral,</hi> which enjoined the whole of their duty to God, their neighbors and themſelves.—And it was this laſt mentioned law that our apoſtle had in view, when he ſaid, that he was "alive without the law."</p>
            <p>Very frequent, in the ſacred writings, we perceive that a <hi>ſtate</hi> of SIN or IMPIETY, is compared to a <hi>ſtate</hi> of DEATH. And alſo, that a <hi>return</hi> to VIRTUE, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> RIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEOUSNESS, is compared to LIFE.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:021347_0015_0FB31BE1124A4428"/>In <hi>this ſenſe</hi> we are to underſtand our Lord, when, in the parable of the prodigal ſon, it is ſaid; "this my ſon <hi>was dead,</hi> and <hi>is alive again;</hi> he was loſt, and is found."<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Luke xv. 24.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame ideas are conveyed by our Saviour in theſe words. "I am the reſurrection and the life. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on me, though he <hi>were dead,</hi>—yet <hi>ſhall he live.</hi> And whoſoever <hi>liveth,</hi> and believeth in me, ſhall <hi>never die;</hi>"<note n="(b)" place="bottom">John xi. 25.</note> or not eternally periſh.</p>
            <p>In ſuch language, Saint Paul often expreſſed himſelf. In his epiſtle to the Romans, he ſays; "Likewiſe reckon ye alſo yourſelves to be <hi>dead,</hi> indeed, unto ſin, but <hi>alive</hi> unto God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord."<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Rom. vi. 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>"Neither yield ye your members as inſtruments of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs unto ſin; but yield yourſelves unto God, as thoſe who are <hi>alive</hi> from the <hi>dead.</hi>"<note n="(d)" place="bottom">ibid. ver. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>"And you," ſaid he to the Epheſians, "hath God <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened,</hi> who <hi>were dead</hi> in treſpaſſes and ſins."<note n="(e)" place="bottom">Eph. ii. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In this ſame mode of ſpeech, in the Revelations of Saint John, was the church in Sardis reproved for their declenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in goodneſs; or defect in righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>"Theſe things ſaith he that hath the ſeven ſpirits of God, and the ſeven ſtars; I know thy works, that thou haſt a name that thou <hi>liveſt,</hi> and art dead."<note n="(f)" place="bottom">Rev. iii. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>When Saint Paul, therefore, agreeable to this manner of expreſſion, "was <hi>alive</hi> without the law,"—we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that he thought <hi>moſt favourably</hi> of his ſpiritual condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that he aſſured himſelf he was in a ſtate of grace, and an heir of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>At that period, he ſays he was "<hi>alive without</hi> the <hi>law;</hi>" —not without a knowledge of the LETTER of it; but of it's SPIRIT; of it's DEMANDS; the extenſion and purity of it's precepts:—Or, he then flattered himſelf he <hi>duly honored</hi> the law, and was entitled to juſtification before God, through an obſervance of it's commands.</p>
            <p>He was then <hi>"alive;"</hi> free from the terrors of guilt; free from all doubts and fears reſpecting his title to immortal happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:021347_0016_0FB31BE28F80C3E8"/>At that moment we behold him as a PHARISEE of the <hi>firſt character;</hi> priding himſelf in his OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS; —his ſtrict obſervance of the Sabbath; his frequent faſtings and deeds of mortification;—his payment of tythes of all things tythable which he poſſeſſed;—his zeal for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the jewiſh religion;—his extraordinary acts of devotion, and almſgiving to the diſtreſſed.</p>
            <p>He then could ſolace himſelf with the reflection, that he was not chargeable with any groſs vice; and "thank God that he was not as other men were; extortioners, unjuſt, adulterers;"<note n="(g)" place="bottom">Luke xviii. 11.</note> but that, in his own eſteem, and in his own words, "as touching the righteouſneſs of the law, he was blameleſs.<note n="(h)" place="bottom">Phil. iii. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>While in this ſituation, he was raiſing the ſuperſtructure of his hopes of ſalvation upon the <hi>unſtable foundation</hi> of the <hi>merit</hi> of his GOOD WORKS.</p>
            <p>Being entirely ignorant of the neceſſity of the RIGHTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUSNESS of CHRIST, to be appropriated to him <hi>by</hi> FAITH, he was endeavoring to eſtabliſh his OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS; not attending to this great truth of the goſpel, that "CHRIST is the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>law,</hi> for RIGHTEOUSNESS to every one who <hi>believeth</hi> in him."<note n="(i)" place="bottom">Rom. x. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was Saint Paul in the "wide and broad way, that leadeth to deſtruction," while he flattered himſelf he was in the "ſtrait and narrow path which conducts to ſalvation!"</p>
            <p>Elevated he was to the pinnacle of danger, while he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended he was reſting on the rock of ages!—Moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, indeed, was his ſituation; though, to him, pleaſing was the deluſion!</p>
            <p>Had he been arreſted by the hand of death, while thus truſting to his <hi>own goodneſs,</hi> for acceptance with God,— how wretched would have been his ſtate!</p>
            <p>But it pleaſed the Almighty to behold him in compaſſion; to awaken him to a ſenſe of his danger. And this was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, by the "<hi>coming</hi> of the <hi>commandment</hi>" to his <hi>mind,</hi> through the efficacy of the ſpirit of grace. "When the <hi>commandment came,</hi> ſin revived, and I died."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:021347_0017_0FB31BE40F4A65F0"/>In ſtrictneſs of ſpeech, it may be ſaid the "command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came" to men, when it was delivered by the Almighty to Moſes, on Mount Sinai. But it could not, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, come to our apoſtle; as the law was given more than fifteen hundred years before he exiſted.</p>
            <p>In one ſenſe, it may be ſaid, "the commandment came" to him, when he was taught it in his youth. But we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuppoſe the commandment thus came to Saint Paul, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his meaning in the text. As he was educated a Phariſee, he, in the early part of his life, became acquainted with the letter of the law;—but ſeveral years elapſed, after he thus attained a knowledge of the commandment, before he uttered the words before us.</p>
            <p>We, therefore, conclude, that when "the commandment came" to him, he beheld it, in ALL its FORCE, EXTENT, and SPIRITUALITY;—he was <hi>then convinced,</hi> that it was deſigned, not only to regulate his <hi>external demeanor,</hi> but to reform, govern, and purify his HEART. He then became ſenſible of that important truth, inculcated by our Saviour, in his expoſition of the law, that "<hi>out</hi> of the <hi>heart</hi> proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, falſe-witneſs, blaſphemies."<note n="(k)" place="bottom">Matt. xv. 19.</note>

            <p>Our apoſtle then beheld the imperfection that attended even his moſt righteous acts, and how far he was from the heavenly kingdom. He then, indeed, had a juſt view of himſelf in the glaſs of the law; he had an eye to ſee that it is "holy, juſt and good;"<note n="(l)" place="bottom">Rom. vii. 12.</note> to diſcern, that it "requires <hi>truth</hi> in the <hi>inward parts,</hi>"<note n="(m)" place="bottom">Pſal. li. 6.</note> and he had an ear to hear it's denunciation of divine wrath againſt the perſon who ſhall violate even the leaſt of its precepts.<note n="(n)" place="bottom">Gal. iii. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>When the commandment <hi>thus came</hi> to Saint Paul, the <hi>ſcene</hi> was <hi>changed;</hi> he was no longer a <hi>proud</hi> PHARISEE; but became an <hi>humble</hi> PENITENT;—his underſtanding was enlightened; the veil of ignorance and deluſion was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from his eyes; his conſcience was alarmed; he felt
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021347_0018_0FB31BE5B302AF70"/>
the preſſure of ſin, the terrors of guilt.—In him <hi>"ſin revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;"</hi> —not to be <hi>indulged;</hi> to <hi>reign;</hi> to <hi>live;</hi> but to <hi>die;</hi> —he endured it's anguiſh, and beheld it's ingratitude, baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and demerits.</p>
            <p>Until that period, the viper of iniquity, if we may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged the ſimilitude, lay in his breaſt, as in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>"Sin <hi>revived,</hi> and he <hi>died.</hi>"— All his hopes of ſalvation, by virtue of his own righteouſneſs, were then <hi>no more;</hi>— he then perceived that he was obnoxious to the <hi>curſe</hi> of the <hi>divine law;</hi>—juſtly expoſed to eternal condemnation;— his heart was then <hi>truly</hi> contrite, and the language of his ſoul was, "what he ſhould do to be ſaved?"<note n="(o)" place="bottom">Acts xvi. 30.</note>—He could then ſupplicate Heaven in the language of penitence; "God be merciful to me a ſinner!"<note n="(p)" place="bottom">Luke xviii. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Then thoſe deeds of righteouſneſs which he regarded as "<hi>gain</hi> to him, he counted," as he ſays, "<hi>loſs,</hi> for CHRIST." <note n="(q)" place="bottom">Phil. iii. 7.</note>—Then "he reſolved to be found <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> not having on his own righteouſneſs which was of the law, but that which was <hi>through faith</hi> in the divine Saviour."<note n="(r)" place="bottom">ibid. verſ. 9.</note>—And then it was, that "the commandment which was ordained unto LIFE, (to thoſe who ſhould perfectly obey it) he "found," as he himſelf expreſſes it, "to be unto DEATH."<note n="(s)" place="bottom">Rom. vii. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Happy was it for Saint Paul, that he thus died, that he might live forever!—From that moment, he felt in himſelf the pulſe of a ſpiritual life;—he was delivered from the burthen of ſin;—he enjoyed the ſmiles of Heaven;—he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came moſt ſtudious to pleaſe God;—he had a juſt deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vice;—his ſoul was enamoured with the love of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;— his affections were ſupremely fixed on the Almighty, —he ſerved him with chearfulneſs, and from principle;— the great object of his purſuit was, the promotion of the glory of God, and the ſalvation of men;—his pleaſures were holy, and his hopes of redemption, ſcriptural.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:021347_0019_0FB31BE8B7F68DA8"/>Then it was, indeed, that he "paſſed from death unto life;"<note n="(t)" place="bottom">John v. 24.</note>—that he was "turned from darkneſs unto LIGHT; from the power of Satan unto God:"<note n="(u)" place="bottom">Acts xxvi. 18.</note>—And then too it was, to ſpeak in his own language, that he "received the Spirit of adoption, whereby he could cry, Abba, Father;"<note n="(v)" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 15.</note> that "the Spirit itſelf bore witneſs with his ſpirit, that he was a child of God; an heir of God, and a joint heir with Chriſt of immortal happineſs!"<note n="(w)" place="bottom">ibid. verſ. 16, 17.</note>

            <p>How great, how bleſſed are the <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity!</hi>— We perceive it is deſigned to <hi>humble</hi> our PRIDE; to diveſt us of <hi>all dependance</hi> on OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS for ſalvation, that we may rely only on the MERITS of CHRIST for eternal happineſs;—that it is intended to illume the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; to give us contritions of heart; to reconcile us to the Almighty;—to renovate our ſouls; to reſtore us to holineſs; the love, ſervice, favour, and enjoyment of God!</p>

               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:021347_0020_0FB31BEB8DB12850"/>From the <hi>religious experience</hi> of SAINT PAUL, that we have noticed; or the progreſs of grace in his heart, which he hath left upon record, and no doubt for our ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, we may make the following practical obſervations.</p>
            <p>FIRST: As Saint Paul, even while he was a zealous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of religion, and a rigid obſerver of its external duties, was indulging <hi>fallacious hopes</hi> of redemption,—we may no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the propenſity mankind have to entertain <hi>unjuſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</hi> of their title to ſalvation; or the probability there is of their <hi>being deceived,</hi> with reſpect to their religious ſtate.</p>
            <p>Our apoſtle was far from being <hi>ſingular,</hi> in this inſtance. —The Jews in general vainly expected to attain ſalvation by their <hi>imperfect obſervance</hi> of the precepts of the law; and this occaſioned them to <hi>reject</hi> the RIGHTEOUSNESS of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>"But Iſrael," ſaith Saint Paul, "which followed after the law of righteouſneſs, hath not attained to the law of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs," (or to the righteouſneſs that God accepteth.) Wherefore? Becauſe, they ſought it, <hi>not</hi> by <hi>faith;</hi> but, as it were, by the <hi>works</hi> of the <hi>law;</hi> for they ſtumbled at that ſtumbling ſtone."<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Rom. ix. 31, 32.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The law demands a <hi>perfect obedience</hi> of each of its injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and as all men are ſinful, "by the <hi>deeds</hi> of the <hi>law,</hi> therefore, we are aſſured, <hi>no fleſh</hi> ſhall be <hi>juſtified</hi> before God;"<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 20.</note> or obtain ſalvation.</p>
            <p>It was the unhappineſs of too many of the people of Iſrael, previous to the promulgation of the goſpel, that, in like manner, they were deceiving themſelves; ſaying in their hearts, in the words of the prophet Jeremiah, "Peace, peace, when there was no peace!"<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Jer. vi. 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And is there not too much reaſon to apprehend, that <hi>great numbers,</hi> even of the <hi>profeſſors</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> cheriſh the ſame ſpirit of <hi>deluſion;</hi> that ſome flatter themſelves they are the heirs of ſalvation, by reaſon they have felt, perhaps, ſome compunction for ſin; have experienced a partial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of their lives; are juſt in their dealings, and are
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021347_0021_0FB31BEE4874DB20"/>
obſervant of the devotional parts of religion?—That others, willing to magnify the grace of God, promiſe themſelves immortal happineſs, by virtue of their faith only in Chriſt, while they are almoſt wholly regardleſs of his commands?</p>
            <p>It cannot reaſonably be doubted, but that, in a variety of ways, many perſons countenance erroneous hopes of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, painful is the reflection, it is not improbable, but that great numbers, even leave the world in this ſtate of <hi>deception!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Lord aſſures us, that in the day of judgment, many, in vain, will claim a title to ſalvation. They will ſay to him, "Lord! Lord! have we not propheſied in thy name; in thy name caſt out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works?" But he will then ſay unto them; "I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty!"<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Matt. vii. 22, 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Will it not, therefore, be wiſdom in us to regard the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolic council, to "<hi>examine ourſelves</hi> whether we are in the faith?"<note n="(e)" place="bottom">2 Cor. xiii. 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>"<hi>Try me,</hi> O God!" ſaid the Pſalmiſt, "and ſeek the ground of my heart! <hi>prove me,</hi> and <hi>examine</hi> my thoughts! <hi>Look well</hi> if there be any wickedneſs in me!"<note n="(f)" place="bottom">Pſal. cxxxix. 23, 24.</note>
            </p>
            <p>How worthy is <hi>ſuch conduct</hi> of our <hi>imitation!</hi>—And moſt true it is, that if we indulge ourſelves in "any wickedneſs," we are not entitled to ſalvation. "For he," ſaith St. John, "who is born of God, <hi>ſinneth not;</hi> but he keepeth himſelf and the wicked one toucheth him not!"<note n="(g)" place="bottom">1 John v. 18.</note>
            </p>
            <p>SECONDLY: As "by the law, we are informed, is the <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>ſin;</hi>"<note n="(h)" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 20.</note> as "the law, it is ſaid, is a SCHOOL MASTER to bring us to Chriſt,"<note n="(i)" place="bottom">Gal. iii. 24.</note>—how grateful ſhould we be to God, for diſpenſing to us the law?</p>
            <p>And that it may be inſtrumental in giving us a proper ſenſe of <hi>ſin,</hi> we perceive the propriety of <hi>preaching</hi> the LAW, in ALL IT'S EXTENT, PURITY and TERROR.</p>
            <p>Thus was it preached by the prophets, by our Lord and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:021347_0022_0FB31BF1A6A99D10"/>
his apoſtles. And never will mankind be properly diſpoſed to liſten to the invitation of MERCY, offered in the GOSPEL, until they ſhall ſuffer themſelves to pay due attention to the <hi>voice</hi> of the LAW.</p>
            <p>Until Saint Paul did thus, he was <hi>"a live;"</hi> diſeſteemed the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; but "when the <hi>commandment came,</hi>" he was ſenſible of his unhappineſs, and duly prized the ſalvation of the goſpel. We diſcern, therefore, the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance</hi> of <hi>cheriſhing convictions</hi> for <hi>ſin,</hi> that we may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to repair to Chriſt, by faith, for redemption.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY: As the law is thus ſubſervient to our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it ſhould, on this account, be <hi>highly reverenced</hi> by us.</p>
            <p>And we ſhould alſo greatly eſteem it, for its moral excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Though we are "ſaved by grace, through faith,"<note n="(k)" place="bottom">Eph. ii. 8.</note> our Saviour moſt forcibly enjoins on us a ſincere and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal obſervance of the precepts of the law. Without which, indeed, or "without holineſs," it is declared, we cannot enjoy ſalvation.<note n="(l)" place="bottom">Heb. xii. 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>What a reverential and affectionate regard had DAVID, for the LAW of GOD?</p>
            <p>"O how I love," ſaid he, "thy law! It is my meditation all the day! How ſweet are thy words unto my taſte! Yea, ſweeter than honey to my mouth."<note n="(m)" place="bottom">Pſal. cxix. 97, 103.</note> "I love thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments above gold! Yea, above fine gold!"<note n="(n)" place="bottom">ibid. verſ. 127.</note>
            </p>
            <p>How did Saint Paul inculcate the commands of the law, and regard them in his life?</p>
            <p>"Shall we continue in ſin," ſaid he, "that grace may abound? God forbid! How ſhall we, who are dead to ſin, live any longer therein?"<note n="(o)" place="bottom">Rom. vi. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And, it is affirmed by him, that "thoſe who are Chriſt's, have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts."<note n="(p)" place="bottom">Gal. v. 24</note>
            </p>
            <p>LASTLY: Moſt happy was it for our apoſtle, that he <hi>did not ſuppreſs</hi> his convictions for ſin, but ſuffered "the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment" to have acceſs to his HEART; as theſe convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions terminated in his ſalvation!</p>

            <p>Let us break off our ſins by righteouſneſs!</p>

            <p>IT is no inconſiderable recommendation of Chriſtianity, that it's benevolent intention is to advance the <hi>preſent</hi> and <hi>future happineſs</hi> of mankind. In this life, it affords the higheſt ſatisfaction our nature is capable of; and, at death, opens to our view, the pleaſing proſpect of a bleſſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</p>
            <p>This future felicity, our holy apoſtle contemplates; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects on with pleaſure, and pants after; as we are informed in the beginning of the chapter we have named. "For we know," ſays he, "that if our earthly houſe of this taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God; an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this we groan earneſtly, deſiring rather to be cloathed upon with our houſe which is from heaven."</p>
            <p>Saint Paul then aſcribes the aſpirations which Chriſtians have after immortal happineſs, and their capability to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of celeſtial joys, to the <hi>influences</hi> of the divine SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT.—"Now he that hath wrought us for the ſelf-ſame thing is God, who hath given us the <hi>earneſt</hi> of his SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT."</p>
            <p>Our apoſtle next conſiders the profeſſors of Chriſtianity, while here, as in a ſtate of pilgrimage, and, in the words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, mentions what it is that directs their ſteps; <hi>governs,</hi> and <hi>influences them</hi> in this world. "We <hi>walk by</hi> FAITH: not by ſight."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:021347_0025_0FB31BF62A3849E0"/>As, in theſe words, it is declared, that FAITH <hi>directs</hi> our <hi>conduct;</hi> and as <hi>great virtue</hi> is <hi>aſcribed</hi> to <hi>faith,</hi> in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred writings, we will beg leave to attend to it's <hi>nature,</hi> and to regard the truth, that it is <hi>"by faith,"</hi> the ſincere profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the goſpel <hi>"walk,"</hi> and <hi>"not by ſight."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Faith, <hi>in general,</hi> may be ſaid to be a perſuaſion of the truth of thoſe things, of which we are <hi>informed,</hi> but of which we have <hi>no ocular</hi> nor <hi>ſenſible demonſtration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſuch is the nature of faith, it may pertain to the things which are of <hi>this world,</hi> as well as of the <hi>world above;</hi> or, it may be ſaid, there is a faith which is <hi>earthly,</hi> and that which is <hi>heavenly,</hi> or <hi>religious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The objects of <hi>earthly faith,</hi> are <hi>innumerable:</hi> What men of diſtinguiſhed character; what cities; what kingdoms; what empires have exiſted, and do now exiſt, at a diſtance from us?—How many events have happened? What changes have there been in the natural and political world? How numerous, indeed, are the things, of which we are inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but which are not within the circle of our obſervation?</p>
            <p>The objects of <hi>religious faith,</hi> are alſo <hi>many.</hi> They include the being of a God, and all his attributes, as revealed to us in the holy ſcriptures; the plurality of perſons in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; the formation of the univerſe;—divine providence;—the economy of our redemption, as exhibited in the goſpel;—the immortality of our ſouls;—the reſurrection of our bodies;—the diſſolution of the world;—a day of judgment;—everlaſting rewards or puniſhments, according to our actions in the preſent ſtate.</p>
            <p>Or, in other words, the objects of this faith, are <hi>all</hi> the doctrines and precepts; promiſes and threatnings, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars contained in the ſacred writings.</p>
            <p>In <hi>one ſenſe,</hi> when we give our aſſent to the truths of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, it may be ſaid, we are poſſeſſed of <hi>faith;</hi> but as the ſcriptures enumerate ſeveral kinds of faith, it will be proper to notice them, that we may have a juſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of that faith, which is eſſential to our ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Does a perſon <hi>believe</hi> the <hi>goſpel?</hi> Does he take upon him the Chriſtian profeſſion?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:021347_0026_0FB31BF7E5990FA0"/>But does he <hi>continue in his ſins;</hi> a ſlave of vice?—Is his faith <hi>uninfluential</hi> on his conduct; is it merely ſpeculative?</p>
            <p>If thus, it is <hi>not</hi> the faith ſpecified in the text;—but that which Saint James alludes to, when be ſays; "Shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will ſhew thee my faith by my works; Thou believeſt there is one God; thou doſt well; the devils alſo believe and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, the <hi>faith without works is dead?</hi>"<note n="(a)" place="bottom">James ii. 19, 20.</note>—Unavailable; inſufficient to thy ſalvation.</p>
            <p>A ſect of <hi>libertine Chriſtians,</hi> (the diſciples of Simon Magus, termed Gnoſticks) aroſe in the days of the apoſtles; they pretended to extraordinary illuminations from Heaven, and taught that nothing more was required of men to obtain ſalvation, than <hi>faith only,</hi> in Chriſt; and thus they encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged the <hi>moſt licentious practices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saint James confutes their impious doctrine; evinces the neceſſity of moral goodneſs, as the fruits of faith, and affirms, that "as the body without the ſpirit is dead; ſo faith, without works, is dead alſo.<note n="(b)" place="bottom">ibid. verſ. 26.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Our Lord, in the parable of the Sower, ſpeaks of a faith that is <hi>temporary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe who have it, "hear the word with joy; they receive the goſpel, even with rapture, and make a ſplendid profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of virtue; but not being eſtabliſhed in goodneſs, "they believe for <hi>a while</hi> and in time of temptation <hi>fall away;</hi>"<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Matt. viii. 13.</note> —they are ſuch as "put the hand to the plough and <hi>look back;</hi>"<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Luke ix. 62.</note> in the words of Saint Paul, they "make ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck of faith and a good conſcience;"<note n="(e)" place="bottom">1 Tim. i. 19.</note>—or "caſt off their firſt faith."<note n="(f)" place="bottom">1 Tim. v. 12.</note>

            <p>Saint Peter gave healing to an object of diſtreſs, a cripple from his infancy, "who was daily laid at the beautiful gate of the temple," to excite charity from the benevolent. When the multitude ſaw the man "walking, leaping and praiſing God, they were filled with wonder and amazement." And unto them, ſaid the apoſtle, "Why marvel ye at this?

            <p>Such faith ſome men may have had, who did not obtain ſalvation; for our Lord aſſures us, that many who ſhall have "propheſied in his name; and in his name ſhall have caſt out Devils, and done many wonderful works," ſhall, at laſt, be rejected by him, becauſe they were "workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty."<note n="(h)" place="bottom">Matt. vii. 22, 23.</note> "And," ſaith Saint Paul, "though I have the gift of prophecy, and underſtand all myſteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith; ſo that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing."<note n="(i)" place="bottom">1 Cor. xiii. 2.</note>

            <p>As it often happened that ſuch perſons died before the biſhop could attend them for this purpoſe, to prevent this inconvenience, as far as poſſible, the canons, in ſome places, required that biſhops ſhould viſit their dioceſis annually; and if they were ſo extenſive that this could not be effected, their dioceſis were to be reduced into ſmaller diſtricts.<note n="§" place="bottom">Se Bingham's Antiquities, Vol. I.

of the eſſential doctrines of Chriſtianity; underſtand the nature of this inſtitution, and receive it with freedom and deliberation.</p>
            <p>Our catechiſm is ſtiled "An inſtruction to be learned of every perſon, before he be brought to be confirmed by the biſhop;"—which is appointed to be done, "ſo ſoon as he can ſay the Creed, the Lord's prayer, and the ten command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the vulgar tongue, and be farther inſtructed in the church catechiſm, ſet forth for that purpoſe."</p>
            <p>The preface to our office of confirmation, very clearly expreſſes the knowledge that is demanded of thoſe who ſhall be confirmed, and declares alſo, the nature and end of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. After reading of which, the following very ſerious and important queſtion is addreſſed to thoſe who wiſh to be confirmed.</p>
            <p>"Do ye here, in the preſence of God, and of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, <hi>renew</hi> the ſolemn promiſe and vow that was made in your name at your baptiſm; <hi>ratifying</hi> and <hi>confirming</hi> the ſame in your <hi>own perſons,</hi> and acknowledging yourſelves <hi>bound</hi> to believe, and do all thoſe things which your God-fathers and God-mothers then undertook for you?"<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>It cannot, we imagine, be <hi>improper</hi> for thoſe members of our churches to be <hi>confirmed</hi> who have arrived even to <hi>old age,</hi> and who have not had an opportunity to ſubmit to this holy rite.</p>
                  <p>Very probably, the greater number of ſuch perſons, were baptized in their <hi>infancy,</hi> and with reſpect to <hi>theſe,</hi> there are the <hi>ſame reaſons</hi> to be offered why <hi>they</hi> ſhould be <hi>confirmed,</hi> as <hi>thoſe</hi> in <hi>youth.</hi> Indeed, ſuch perſons who are advanced in life, ſhould, we conceive, with <hi>alacrity,</hi> embrace the <hi>firſt opportunity</hi> to partake of the benefits of confirmation.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>ſuch too,</hi> we apprehend, ſhould be the conduct of thoſe <hi>communicants</hi> among us, who have <hi>not</hi> been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
                  <p>The holy <hi>ſacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lord's ſupper,</hi> is entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from the ſacred rite of <hi>confirmation,</hi> and was inſtituted to anſwer a <hi>very different end,</hi> viz. to maintain in us a lively ſenſe of <hi>gratitude</hi> for the death and paſſion of our Saviour. How different is <hi>this</hi> from the <hi>ſolemn dedication</hi> of ourſelves to GOD; the <hi>ratification</hi> of our <hi>baptiſmal vows</hi> and <hi>promiſes,</hi> in confirmation?</p>
                  <p>As it was not intended that the <hi>reception</hi> of the <hi>euchariſt</hi> ſhould <hi>releaſe</hi> us from an <hi>obſervance</hi> of the <hi>ſacrament</hi> of <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> we can diſcern <hi>no reaſon</hi> why <hi>ſuch</hi> an act ſhould <hi>free</hi> us from a <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to <hi>that rite</hi> which is a <hi>recognition</hi> and <hi>confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of our <hi>baptiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He who <hi>communicates,</hi> performs an act of devotion; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes his thankfulneſs for the death of Chriſt; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges his belief in him, and obligations to revere his precepts. And does not the <hi>non-communicant</hi> THUS, when he repeats the Creeds, and joins in the Liturgy of our church?</p>
                  <p>But as neither of theſe perſons, by ſuch conduct, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally</hi> takes on himſelf his <hi>baptiſmal obligations,</hi> no ſufficient reaſon, we preſume, can be rendered, why <hi>both</hi> of them ſhould <hi>not be confirmed,</hi> if they have not received confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>this</hi> is an inſtitution of our church; as it is, in itſelf, <hi>moſt ſolemn</hi> and <hi>edifying,</hi> and cannot, with the <hi>leaſt impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,</hi> be regarded by any <hi>worthy communicant,</hi> for the ſake of EXAMPLE, if for <hi>no other end,</hi> communicants, we are of opinion, would act with <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>wiſdom,</hi> ſhould they <hi>honor</hi> this <hi>ſacred rite.</hi>

            <p>An author of eminence mentions, "That, in the Jewiſh church, when a child attained the age of thirteen years, the father, having taught him the principles of his religion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him, in a ſacred aſſembly, to undertake, in his own perſon, to become a ſon of the precept;—that is, one who takes upon himſelf, from that period, obedience to the law of God, and to anſwer for his ſins; and that, thereafter, prayer was made for his improvement in grace."<note n="*" place="bottom">Buxtorf.

            <p>The impoſition of hands and prayer, by the biſhop, always attended confirmation; and it was cuſtomary to anoint thoſe who were confirmed with oil, to denote that heavenly unction that was received by them from above;<note n="†" place="bottom">See Bingham's antiquities, Vol. I, Fol. 535, 536<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>The ſanctifying and more ordinary influences, however, of the divine Spirit, may reaſonably be expected to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, when this rite is duly adminiſtered.

            <p>It is obſerved, by a celebrated author, "That though men have not in confirmation, the gift of tongues conferred on them, as in the days of the apoſtles, they may, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, have other gifts, ſufficient to teſtify the preſence of the divine Spirit; and alſo, to entitle the act of the impoſition of hands to the dignity of an apoſtolic inſtitution."<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Bingham's Antiquities, Vol. I.

            <p>As baptiſm, in the primitive church, <hi>preceded</hi> confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo this rite was adminiſtered, <hi>previous</hi> to the reception of the Lord's ſupper; and this practice is enjoined by our church.</p>
            <p>It was the general cuſtom of the church, in the firſt ages of chriſtianity, for thoſe who were <hi>confirmed, immediately</hi> to <hi>partake</hi> of the EUCHARIST. If, however, there were any who had received confirmation, but <hi>did not communicate,</hi> they were, on that account, expoſed to the <hi>cenſures</hi> of the church, which were ſevere.</p>
            <p>No reaſonable objection can be made againſt <hi>that</hi> perſon's approaching the table of the Lord who has <hi>worthily</hi> received confirmation;—on the contrary, it is, unqueſtionably, <hi>moſt proper;</hi> and it may be of great utility for thoſe who have been <hi>confirmed,</hi> to <hi>partake</hi> of the <hi>Lord's ſupper;</hi>—that the grace they have received in confirmation, may thereby be augmented; that they may be confirmed in goodneſs, and, in

                  <p>EUSEBIUS (in his Eccleſ. Hiſt. Lib. iii. book xx.) men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from SAINT CLEMENS, (who in 188 was made catechiſt in the ſchool of Alexandria, and who was tutor to Origen) that SAINT JOHN, when he returned to Epheſus, from his baniſhment by Domitian, to the iſle of Patmos, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the adjacent country, to diſcharge the duties of his function, he was ſmitten with the goodly appearance of a young man, and commended him to the care of an Aſian biſhop, who paid great attention to the youth, and inſtructed him in the principles of chriſtianity. Some time thereafter, however, the young man, by evil companions, ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to become very diſſolute, and even to be guilty of theft, and ſeveral enormous crimes.

                  <p>CHEMNITIUS, a <hi>Lutheran</hi> clergyman of eminence, ſays; "Our divines have often ſhewed, that the <hi>rite</hi> of <hi>confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (unprofitable, ſuperſtitious, and anti-ſcriptural traditions, being removed from it) might be piouſly uſed, and to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the church, according to the <hi>conſent</hi> of <hi>ſcripture,</hi> after this manner, viz.

to chriſtianity; to eſtabliſh them in the faith, and, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, to <hi>confirm</hi> them.</p>
            <p>When he "came and ſaw" the effects of "the grace of God," he <hi>"was glad;"</hi> tranſported with holy joy; and, with great fervor, "exhorted them all, that, <hi>with purpoſe of heart;</hi>" with the greateſt ſincerity; with invincible for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, reſolution and patience, notwithſtanding the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they might meet with, "they would <hi>cleave unto the</hi> LORD;" with firmneſs, adhere to his doctrines; with pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, reverence his ordinances, and precepts; with diligence, endeavor to promote his glory, and, in all their actions, to approve themſelves to his eye of omniſcience!</p>
            <p>We cannot doubt but theſe NEW DISCIPLES were <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi> to this exhortation of VIRTUE! That they diſcerned it's <hi>importance!</hi> That they were convinced their preſent and future happineſs, depended on their "<hi>cleaving to the</hi> LORD, with <hi>full purpoſe of heart!</hi>"</p>

            <p>How worthy of <hi>imitation</hi> is their EXAMPLE! As we have the <hi>ſame incentives</hi> to holineſs, as had theſe converts at Antioch, let us indulge the hope, that we ſhall duly honor our chriſtian profeſſion!</p>
            <p>What, indeed, ſhall tempt us to a <hi>different conduct?</hi> ſhall the infamy of vice; the pangs of guilt; the dread of future miſery; the diſpleaſure of our God?

            <p>GOD, <hi>angels</hi> and <hi>men,</hi> will <hi>look</hi> for VIRTUE, for <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deportment,</hi> in thoſe eſpecially who have <hi>now</hi> been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to him!</p>
            <p>And we humbly hope, that "pure and undefiled religion" <hi>will</hi> be theirs! That it will <hi>ſhine forth</hi> in their lives and converſations; to their own honor; the honor of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,

            <p>THE ſacraments of chriſtianity were ordained in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to the weakneſs of our nature; they are but few in number, <hi>baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's ſupper;</hi> and, when duly regarded, are attended with very eſſential advantages.</p>
            <p>At preſent permit us to pay a little attention to the laſt-mentioned of theſe ordinances now before us, which was inſtituted by our Saviour, but a ſhort time before his paſſion.</p>
            <p>In diſcourſing on this ſacrament, we will,</p>
            <p>FIRST, Explain it's nature.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, Shew the obligations we are under to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this inſtitution.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, Regard the qualifications requiſite to our due reception of it.</p>
            <p>FOURTHLY, Notice ſome of the advantages which will attend a proper diſcharge of this ſervice.</p>
            <p>LASTLY, We will pay attention to ſome of thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars which prevent many from receiving this ordinance.</p>
            <p>FIRST, we are to explain the nature of the ſacrament of the Lord's ſupper.</p>
            <p>Though ſome authors have greatly <hi>perplexed</hi> and <hi>embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> this ſubject, we apprehend it is, in itſelf, <hi>extremely ſimple;</hi> and that it may be fully, and clearly explained in a few words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:021347_0061_0FB31C429261D750"/>Properly to underſtand this chriſtian rite, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to obſerve, that it was <hi>typified</hi> under the Jewiſh eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>paſchal ſupper</hi> was inſtituted to maintain in the minds of the Jews, a ſenſe of the goodneſs of God in <hi>preſerving</hi> them <hi>from death,</hi> when the deſtroying angel flew the Firſt-born, in every dwelling of the Egyptians.—That the Jewiſh paſſover was ordained to <hi>effect this purpoſe,</hi> is very evident from the words of it's inſtitution, which are contained in the twelfth chapter of the book of Exodus.</p>
            <p>"Then Moſes called for all the elders of Iſrael, and ſaid unto them; draw out and take unto you a lamb, according to your families, and kill the paſſover. And ye ſhall take a bunch of hyſop, and dip it into the blood that is in the baſon, and ſtrike the lintel, and the two ſide-poſts, with the blood that is in the baſon; and none of you ſhall go out at the door of his houſe until the morning. For the Lord will paſs through to ſmite the Egyptians, and when he ſeeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two ſide-poſts, the Lord will paſs over the door, and will not ſuffer the deſtroyer to come unto your houſes to ſmite you. And ye ſhall obſerve this thing for an ordinance to thee, and to thy ſons, for ever. And it ſhall come to paſs, when ye be come to the land which the Lord will give you, according as he hath promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ye ſhall keep this ſervice. And it ſhall come to paſs, when your children ſhall ſay unto you; what mean you by this ſervice? That ye ſhall ſay, it is the ſacrifice of the Lord's paſſover, who paſſed over the houſes of the children of Iſrael in Egypt, when he <hi>ſmote</hi> the Egyptians and <hi>deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our houſes.</hi>"</p>
            <p>That this event was typical of a much greater deliverance that mankind ſhould receive, even a <hi>deliverance from eternal death,</hi> by virtue of the ſacrifice of Chriſt; and that the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal lamb was a figure of our Saviour, is manifeſt from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers paſſages of ſacred writ.</p>
            <p>Was the paſchal lamb ordered to be ſlain on the <hi>fourteenth day,</hi> of the firſt month, at even?—On the <hi>ſame day,</hi> at even, of that month, did our Saviour offer himſelf a propitiatory ſacrifice for our ſins; and, in alluſion to the paſchal lamb, he
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:021347_0062_0FB31C4417684B58"/>
was ſtiled, by John the baptiſt; "The <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> that tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away the ſins of the world."<note n="*" place="bottom">John i. 29.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Was there no deliverance from death, for any Iſraelite, who, on the night of the paſſover, ſhould <hi>not continue</hi> in his dwelling, the lintel and two ſide-poſts of which, were ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the blood of the paſchal lamb?—Neither are we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from everlaſting death, unleſs we are <hi>under covert</hi> of the blood of Chriſt; by it, "have our hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience;"<note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. x. 22.</note> for it is this blood only, we are aſſured, "that cleanſeth us from ſin."<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 John i. 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Was the paſchal lamb ſlain <hi>before</hi> the Moſaick law and ſacrifices were enjoined on the people of Iſrael?—This was expreſſive of the truth, that mankind could not be redeemed by an obſervance of the law and the Moſaick rites, but by virtue only of the <hi>true paſſover,</hi> "the lamb of God, ſlain, (in the divine purpoſe,) from the foundation of the world."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Rev. xiii. 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is worthy of obſervation, that our Saviour conſtantly celebrated the Jewiſh paſſover at Jeruſalem, (and when only twelve years old, we are informed, he repaired to that city for this purpoſe<note n="§" place="bottom">Luke ii. 42.</note> until he aboliſhed this rite, by inſtituting another ordinance in it's place.</p>
            <p>Juſt before his death, he ſaid to his apoſtles; "With de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire I have deſired to eat this paſſover with you, before I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. For I ſay unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until IT be <hi>fulfilled</hi> in the <hi>kingdom</hi> of GOD;"—or, as we conceive, the ſenſe is: 'I will no more partake of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; <hi>that</hi> which IT <hi>typified,</hi> will ſoon be <hi>accompliſhed</hi> in the <hi>ſpiritual kingdom</hi> I have eſtabliſhed; and, after my reſurrection, I will, <hi>in ſpirit,</hi> be <hi>preſent</hi> with ſuch worthy members of my church, as ſhall aſſemble to commemorate my paſſion, and rejoice, with them, in the happy fruits and effects of my ſufferings.'</p>
            <p>That Saint Paul apprehended the paſchal lamb, was an <hi>emblem</hi> of the ſacrifice of Chriſt, is very evident from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing exhortation to the church at Corinth. "CHRIST our <hi>paſſover</hi> is <hi>ſacrificed for us;</hi> therefore, let us keep the

feaſt; not with old leaven; neither with the leaven of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and wickedneſs; but with the unleavened bread of ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and truth."</p>
            <p>As the <hi>principal intention</hi> of the Jewiſh paſſover, was, as hath been noticed, to occaſion the Iſraelites, ever to be <hi>grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to God for that ſignal inſtance of his goodneſs, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving them from <hi>death,</hi> when the firſt born of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians were ſlain;—ſo the <hi>primary intention</hi> of the chriſtian paſſover, or of the ſacrament of the Lord's ſupper, is, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in our minds a <hi>lively ſenſe</hi> of <hi>gratitude</hi> for the ſufferings of our Saviour, to deliver us from <hi>death eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"This do, in <hi>remembrance</hi> of <hi>me.</hi>"</p>
            <p>As if our Lord ſhould have ſaid, 'this bread, by me brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and given to you, repreſents my body, which I ſhall now give to be broken on the Croſs for your redemption; often thus break bread, and partake of it, that you may not be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful</hi> of my ſufferings; but always <hi>retain ſentiments</hi> of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for that teſtimony I ſhall give you of my affection;— the purchaſe of your ſalvation, at the expence of my death and paſſion.'</p>
            <p>Such, we preſume, is the <hi>nature</hi> of this ſacrament. We proceed,</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, to conſider the <hi>obligations</hi> we are under to <hi>regard it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Jewiſh paſſover was a type of this ordinance; the former, the ſhadow, of which the latter, is the ſubſtance, we may rationally conclude, from <hi>this conſideration,</hi> that this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is <hi>moſt forcibly</hi> enjoined on us by divine authority; as the people of Iſrael were poſitively commanded to obſerve the paſſover; and, indeed, upon their non-obſervance of it, without a juſt reaſon, they were to be <hi>put to death.</hi> "The man," it is written, "that is clean; and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the paſſover, even the ſame ſoul ſhall be <hi>cut off</hi> from his people."</p>
            <p>The <hi>authority</hi> of our LORD to <hi>inſtitute ſacraments</hi> is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable;</hi> for "all power was given to him in Heaven and in earth."<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xxviii. 18.</note> And can any command be <hi>more explicit,</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:021347_0064_0FB31C48DE22C478"/>
than <hi>that</hi> which enjoins on us this ſacrament? "THIS DO, in remembrance of me."</p>
            <p>This ſervice, it may be remarked, is farther enjoined on us, not only by the <hi>example</hi> of the <hi>primitive church,</hi> but alſo, by the words of Saint Paul.</p>
            <p>"For I have received of the Lord," ſaid he, to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, "<hi>that</hi> which I alſo <hi>delivered unto you;</hi> that the Lord Jeſus, the ſame night in which he was betrayed, took bread; and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and ſaid; Take eat; this is my Body which is broken for you; <hi>this do</hi> in remembrance of me. After the ſame manner he took the cup, when he had ſupped, ſaying; This cup is the New-Teſtament in my blood; <hi>this do,</hi> as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's death until he comes."<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. xi. 23 to 26.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To prevent our unworthy reception of this ſacrament, we are entreated previouſly to <hi>examine</hi> whether we have that preparation which it requires. "But let a man <hi>examine himſelf,</hi> and <hi>ſo let him eat</hi> of that bread, and drink of that cup."<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. ver. 28.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe, and other expreſſions of Saint Paul, clearly enforce on us this duty. And as it is alſo enjoined on us by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>gratitude,</hi> it may moſt juſtly be affirmed, that there is not any precept of ſacred writ <hi>more explicitly,</hi> nor <hi>more forcibly,</hi> enjoined on us, than is the <hi>injunction,</hi> in the text, that requires us to be partakers of this holy ſacrament.</p>
            <p>As this fact cannot, conſiſtent with our religious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, be queſtioned by any of us, we ſhall now,</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, attend to the <hi>qualifications</hi> requiſite to our <hi>due obſervance</hi> of this ordinance.</p>
            <p>We perceive, from what hath been ſaid, that the <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal intention</hi> of this ſacrament, is to <hi>preſerve</hi> in <hi>our minds</hi> a <hi>ſenſe of gratitude</hi> for the <hi>love of</hi> CHRIST in effecting our ſalvation, by virtue of his death.</p>
            <p>But is it poſſible our hearts can be <hi>duly impreſſed</hi> with a
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:021347_0065_0FB31C4ACE8339A8"/>
ſenſe of thankfulneſs to Chriſt, while we are in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence;</hi> not entitled to the bleſſings of the goſpel, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of it's ſacred precepts?</p>
            <p>Impoſſible is it for the perſon who is a ſtranger to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; deſtitute of faith in Chriſt, and inattentive to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine commands, to be an heir of ſalvation; to be <hi>truly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> for the mercies of Chriſt; or to render him an acceptable ſervice.</p>
            <p>But when we are chriſtians indeed, though our graces may be defective; our religious attainments imperfect, we <hi>are qualified</hi> to approach this ordinance; we have that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, which, in the judgment of our church, is requiſite to our being <hi>worthy partakers</hi> of this ſacrament; for then we "truly repent of our former ſins; ſteadfaſtly purpoſe to lead a new life; have a lively faith in God's mercy, through Chriſt; a thankful remembrance of his death, and are in charity with all men."</p>
            <p>A moment's reflection would be ſufficient to convince us, that it would be, moſt abſurd and criminal, for a profeſſed INFIDEL to receive this ſacrament. But the perſon who <hi>profeſſes</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> in the chriſtian faith, but <hi>demes it</hi> in <hi>prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,</hi> is, perhaps, more guilty than ſuch a character; and as ſinful, at leaſt, would it be, for an impious chriſtian to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>The perſon, therefore, of impenitence; of practical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity; of impurity of heart and life; deſtitute of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, muſt be <hi>unprepared</hi> to celebrate the paſſion of our Lord.</p>
            <p>We haſten to the <hi>fourth</hi> propoſition, which was to notice ſome of the <hi>advantages</hi> which <hi>attend</hi> the <hi>worthy reception</hi> of this ſacrament.</p>
            <p>It may be ſaid that it is beneficial to us, in ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
            <p>It will occaſion our obſervance of the divine precepts to be <hi>more perfect,</hi> and <hi>acceptable</hi> to the Almighty.</p>
            <p>No obedience can be pleaſing to God, that <hi>proceeds not</hi> from LOVE. The obedience of SERVILITY and FEAR,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:021347_0066_0FB31C4E2A6B7B58"/>
cannot be acceptable to the Deity; who requires the free-will offering of the heart.<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xxiii. 26.</note> And impoſſible is it, that we ſhould love God, unleſs we ſhall be convinced of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his nature; or be ſenſible of his love to us. As, in this ſacrament, we commemorate the ſufferings of Chriſt, we have the higheſt teſtimony of the Almighty's affection for us, in giving the ſon of his love to be a propitiatory ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for our ſins; our hearts, therefore, we may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hope, will be impreſſed with a ſenſe of love to the God of beneficence. And thus, while we are rendering to God a <hi>moſt rational tribute</hi> of <hi>gratitude,</hi> we are <hi>excited</hi> and <hi>enabled,</hi> with <hi>greater perfection,</hi> and <hi>more acceptably,</hi> to <hi>honor</hi> his <hi>laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we duly commemorate the paſſion of our Lord, and have a lively ſenſe of the <hi>ignominy</hi> of his death; of his excruciating pangs, both of body and ſoul, which he endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to atone for our guilt, can we be <hi>inſenſible</hi> of the <hi>demerits</hi> of <hi>ſin;</hi> of the puniſhment due to the violation of the divine law? And, conſequently, muſt not our hatred againſt ſin be increaſed; our reſolutions of virtue be ſtrengthened?</p>
            <p>When, in this ordinance, we receive the ſymbols of our Saviour's paſſion, while our <hi>faith thereby</hi> ſhall be increaſed, will not our <hi>hearts</hi> be <hi>expanded</hi> with CHARITY to <hi>all men,</hi> even to our <hi>enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it poſſible to have proper conceptions of the love of Chriſt, manifeſted in his death, to all men; to the moſt guilty and unworthy; to his greateſt enemies, even his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, and not feel compaſſion for our greateſt foes; not be deſirous of advancing the felicity of all mankind?</p>
            <p>Among other benefits, we might enumerate, which will be derived to us, by our worthy reception of this ſacrament, we ſhall only mention, that thereby we ſhall obtain <hi>abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> for our <hi>ſins;</hi> and alſo, have our <hi>hearts repleniſhed</hi> with <hi>grace;</hi> or, in the language of our communion office, we ſhall "ſpiritually eat the fleſh of Chriſt, and drink his blood;
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:021347_0067_0FB31C4F4D63C7B8"/>
dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in us; be one with Chriſt, and Chriſt with us;" and alſo, have our <hi>affection</hi> for <hi>each other,</hi> as members of a religious community, greatly augmented and eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>The primitive chriſtians were juſtly diſtinguiſhed, for their love and benevolence "to all men; but eſpecially to thoſe of the houſehold of faith."<note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. vi. 10.</note> And it cannot reaſonably be doubted, but their <hi>ardent affection</hi> for <hi>each other;</hi> their <hi>unity,</hi> and <hi>diſtinguiſhed piety,</hi> were, in a great degree, owing to that attention which they paid to this ſacred inſtitution.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>The primitive chriſtians uſed to partake of this holy ſacrament <hi>daily,</hi> or as often as they aſſembled for public worſhip, and this practice continued a <hi>conſiderable time</hi> in the church.</p>
                  <p>"We receive," ſays <hi>Saint Cyprian,</hi> "the Euchariſt <hi>every day,</hi> as the food that nouriſhes us to ſalvation."</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saint Ambroſe</hi> mentions that <hi>this cuſtom</hi> prevailed in the Dioceſs of Milan.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saint Jerome</hi> informs us, that <hi>this practice</hi> obtained alſo in the church of Rome.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Saint Auguſtin</hi> intimates, that it was <hi>not uncommon</hi> in his time.</p>
                  <p>In the churches of the <hi>eaſt,</hi> this cuſtom began firſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline. Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> tells us, that, in his days, they communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated <hi>four times a week;</hi> on the Lord's day, Wedneſday, Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and Saturday, and alſo upon other days, if the memory or feſtival of any martyr fell upon them.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, as the power of religion began more ſenſibly to <hi>decay,</hi> this ſacrament was received by the church <hi>once</hi> or <hi>twice</hi> only a <hi>week;</hi> in ſome time thereafter, but <hi>once</hi> a <hi>month,</hi> and, in proceſs of time, in moſt churches, but <hi>three times in a year,</hi> viz. at Chriſtmas, Eaſter and Witſuntide. See <hi>Cave's</hi> Primitive Chriſtianity, Chap. XI. Page 339, 340.</p>
                  <p>Originally, ALL the members of the church <hi>communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> but as chriſtians increaſed in number, a more <hi>exact diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,</hi> in this reſpect, became neceſſary. None were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to this ordinance until they had arrived to the degree of the <hi>faithful;</hi> for <hi>catechumens,</hi> and ſuch as for ſome crime, were under the <hi>cenſure</hi> and <hi>ſuſpenſion</hi> of the church, and had not paſſed through the ſeveral ſtages of <hi>penitents,</hi> were not allowed to communicate, but commanded to <hi>depart</hi> from the church when this ſacrament was adminiſtered. Ibid. P. 333.</p>
                  <p>All thoſe, however, who were baptized, and againſt whoſe conduct no exception was made, were not only <hi>permitted,</hi> but, by the rules of the church, <hi>obliged</hi> to communicate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of eccleſiaſtical cenſure.</p>
                  <p>The moſt ancient canons are very expreſs to this purpoſe. Among thoſe ſtiled the <hi>apoſtolical canons,</hi> there is one in the following words. "All ſuch of the faithful as come to church, and hear the ſcriptures read, but <hi>ſtay not</hi> to the prayers, <hi>nor partake</hi> of the <hi>holy communion,</hi> ought to be <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended</hi> as authors of <hi>diſorder</hi> in the church."</p>
                  <p>Which canon the <hi>council</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> repeats with a little enlargement. "All ſuch as come into the church of God, and hear the holy ſcriptures read, but <hi>do not communicate</hi> with the people in prayer, and <hi>refuſe</hi> to <hi>partake</hi> of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> which is a <hi>diſorderly practice,</hi> ought to be <hi>caſt out</hi> of the <hi>church,</hi> 'till they confeſs their fault, and bring forth fruit of repentance; when they do ſo, if they aſk pardon, they may obtain it." See Bingham's Antiquities of the chriſtian church, Vol. I. Book XV. Chap. IV. Fol. 769.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt ages of chriſtianity, not only <hi>catechumens</hi> and thoſe <hi>under penance,</hi> but <hi>all</hi> the <hi>other</hi> members of the church, except communicants, were required to <hi>withdraw</hi> when this holy ſacrament was diſpenſed.</p>
                  <p>But in the days of <hi>Saint Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ſoſtom,</hi> there were ſome who requeſted the privilege to be <hi>preſent</hi> during the performance of the whole office of the communion, without being <hi>obliged</hi> to <hi>communicate.</hi> They were not willing to be accounted <hi>penitents,</hi> and to be <hi>ſhut out</hi> of the church with them; nor yet, would they be <hi>communicants.</hi> Againſt <hi>ſuch</hi> perſons, this <hi>eloquent father</hi> inveighs with a conſiderable degree of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                  <p>"Are you <hi>unworthy,</hi>" ſaid he to them, "of the ſacrifice, and unfit to partake of it? Neither then are you <hi>worthy</hi> of the <hi>prayers.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>Do you not hear the church's herald proclaiming, "All ye who are <hi>penitents withdraw!</hi>" All thoſe who do not cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, are penitents. If thou art of the number of peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, thou mayeſt not partake. For he who is not a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, is a penitent.</p>
                  <p>Why does he ſay; "All ye who cannot pray, depart?" And why do you impudently ſtay?</p>
                  <p>I am not one of thoſe, will you ſay, but of ſuch as may partake. Conſider, I pray you, and ſeriouſly weigh the matter. The royal table is prepared; angels give their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance; the Lord himſelf is preſent, and do you ſtand yawning as an idle ſpectator only?</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>garments</hi> are <hi>defiled,</hi> and are you under <hi>no concern?</hi> But will you ſay, they are clean. Then ſit down and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take!</p>
                  <p>The king comes daily to ſee the gueſts, and diſcourſes with them all. And now he ſays in your conſciences; friends, how came you to ſtand here, not having on a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment? He ſaid not, why art thou ſet down? But before he was ſet down, he pronounced him unworthy. For he ſaid not, Why art thou <hi>ſet down?</hi> But, <hi>Why cameſt thou in hither?</hi> The ſame now he ſays to every one who ſtandeth here with an impudent boldneſs. For every one who doth not partake, is ſhameleſs and impudent.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who are in ſin, are for that, firſt caſt out. As none of thoſe who are not initiated into the church by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ſhould be preſent; ſo neither ſhould any who are initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, if they are defiled.</p>
                  <p>Tell me, if any one who is invited to a feaſt, waſhes his hands, and ſits down, and is prepared for the table, and yet <hi>eats not,</hi> does he not <hi>affront</hi> the perſon who invited him? Were it not better that ſuch an one ſhould not be preſent?</p>
                  <p>In like manner, thou art preſent; thou haſt ſung the hymn, and made profeſſion with the reſt, that thou art of thoſe who are worthy, inaſmuch as thou didſt not depart with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. How is it that thou remaineſt, and yet doſt not partake at the table? Art thou unworthy? Thou art then unworthy alſo of the communion of prayers." Chryſ. Hom. III. in Epheſ. Page 1051.</p>

               <pb n="72" facs="unknown:021347_0069_0FB31C5431D08870"/>
And as there are many who ſeem diſpoſed to <hi>obſerve</hi> this duty; but ſuffer themſelves, to be diverted from it, through various impediments, we ſhall, therefore, as we propoſed,</p>

               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:021347_0070_0FB31C5569B70BF0"/>LASTLY, Notice ſome of thoſe <hi>obſtacles</hi> which occaſion numbers to <hi>omit this ſervice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some there are, who decline to communicate, by reaſon there is an <hi>interruption</hi> of that <hi>affection</hi> and harmony which ſubſiſted between them, and their neighbour; and, in juſtification of their conduct, they adduce the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>"If thou bringeſt thy gift to the altar and there remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bereſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee, leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way; firſt be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift."</p>
            <p>Theſe words ſuppoſe, that the perſon here alluded to, who "brings his gift to the altar," <hi>is</hi> the <hi>aggreſſor;</hi> HE "there remembereth, that his brother hath <hi>ought againſt</hi> HIM." When this is the caſe, that the offending party may offer an acceptable ſervice to God, it is neceſſary he ſhould make all reaſonable ſatisfaction, in his power, for the injury done to his neighbour. This is ALL that is required in this caſe. And though the party offended ſhould <hi>refuſe</hi> to be reconciled to him, he may, notwithſtanding, "come and offer his gift."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:021347_0071_0FB31C586D6BCEC0"/>But if thoſe who make this objection, are <hi>not</hi> the <hi>aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors;</hi> but have been injured, they have only to <hi>forgive</hi> the injury, and then, agreeable to the dictates of reaſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they are at <hi>liberty</hi> to attend on this ordinance.</p>
            <p>There are others, who abſent themſelves from the Lord's table, becauſe they apprehend it is approached by ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of <hi>immoral character.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may, indeed, ſome times, be thus. There may be thoſe, who, as <hi>Saint Auguſtin</hi> obſerves, "preſs the ſacred elements with their teeth, when they do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mbrace Chriſt with their hearts."</p>
            <p>We ſhould not, however, he <hi>haſty</hi> to <hi>cenſure</hi> our chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian brother; but rather be inclined, with an holy ſeverity, to judge ourſelves.</p>
            <p>It muſt, notwithſtanding, be the <hi>duty</hi> of the governors of every church, upon <hi>proper information,</hi> to examine into the charge of immoral conduct againſt communicants; and, if convinced of their impiety, to ſuſpend them the privilege of the communion, until they ſhall offer ſufficient teſtimony of their reformation.</p>
            <p>Imperfect, indeed, muſt be the diſcipline of that church, which <hi>knowingly</hi> admits unworthy characters to partake of this holy ſacrament!</p>
            <p>But it is moſt true, that ſuch perſons, pollute the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance only to themſelves; for, in the language of an apoſtle, "to the pure, all thing are pure."<note n="*" place="bottom">Titus i. 15.</note> We cannot ſuppoſe, that our Lord would have ſuffered Judas to have received this ſacrament, had his preſence polluted it to any but himſelf.</p>
            <p>There are others, who, <hi>through</hi> FEAR, are prevented from commemorating the death of Chriſt. They imagine they are <hi>unworthy</hi> to approach the Lord's table; and that ſhould they "eat and drink unworthily, they would eat and drink <hi>damnation</hi> to themſelves."</p>
            <p>Such, are perſons of vice, or virtue. If they are devoid of that religion the goſpel requires, "wherefore do they not repent, and amend? Why will they render that as <hi>an excuſe</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:021347_0072_0FB31C5AC146E780"/>
for not performing this duty, which reflects ſo much <hi>diſgrace</hi> on themſelves; and, from which through divine aid, they can obtain deliverance?</p>
            <p>Or why will they incline to <hi>continue</hi> in that ſtate, which occaſions them to be unprepared for death; unfit indeed to offer the Almighty any act of devotion, either of prayer, or praiſe? For "the ſacrifice of the <hi>wicked</hi> is an abomination to the Lord."</p>
            <p>If thoſe who apprehend they are unworthy to commune, are poſſeſſed of penitence for ſin; faith in Chriſt; hearts of ſincerity, and purity, and unfeigned deſires and reſolutions, to obey the divine commands, to the utmoſt of their ability, they will be acceptable gueſts at this holy banquet; for we are aſſured, that "God accepteth according to what a man <hi>hath;</hi> and not according to that which he <hi>hath not.</hi>"<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. viii. 12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Such perſons, therefore, <hi>ſhould not</hi> be <hi>intimidated</hi> from diſcharging their duty, in this inſtance. Practice, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, will render them <hi>more perfect</hi> in the performance of it; and, if in virtue, they have not arrived to the greateſt degree of perfection, the conſideration, that the obſervance of <hi>this duty</hi> will have a tendency to <hi>promote</hi> their <hi>growth</hi> in GRACE, and <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> them in GOODNESS, ſhould be a <hi>forcible incentive</hi> to <hi>engage</hi> them in the <hi>practice</hi> of this <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi> and advantageous ſervice.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who receive this ſacrament, while in a ſtate of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence; or to accompliſh ſiniſter views; or through the prevalence of cuſtom; or with diſſimulation, or irreverance, unqueſtionably, receive it in an <hi>unworthy manner,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any benefit to themſelves. And though the <hi>ſin</hi> of <hi>ſuch</hi> is <hi>great,</hi> it is NOT <hi>unpardonable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some members of the church of Corinth, even while in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>intoxication,</hi> partook of this ordinance. This oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned them "not to <hi>diſcern</hi> the Lord's body." And ſuch conduct, this groſs profanation of this inſtitution, was ſo offenſive to God, that he inflicted on them temporal judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they might not again be chargeable with ſuch impiety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="unknown:021347_0073_0FB31C5CA8A82848"/>"He that eateth and drinketh unworthily," ſaid St. Paul, "eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf;" or provokes God to inflict ſome judgment upon him, that he may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed from this ſin; for the word rendered <hi>damnation,</hi> in the original, ſignifies <hi>judgment.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">The word, in this paſſage of ſacred writ, that is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>damnation,</hi> is <hi>krima,</hi> which imports <hi>temporal judgment.</hi> The <hi>ſame word</hi> is uſed by Saint Peter, 1 Ep. iv. 17. "The time is come that <hi>judgment</hi> muſt begin at the houſe of God."</note>
            </p>
            <p>"For this cauſe," added our apoſtle, "many are weakly and ſickly among you, and many ſleep," or are dead. "If we would judge ourſelves we ſhould not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chaſtened of the Lord that we ſhould not be condemned with the world."</p>
            <p>We ſhall mention but one particular more, which, we fear, prevents ſome from attending on this holy ordinance; though there are not any, perhaps, ſo candid as to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it; and this is an apprehenſion, that if, they ſhall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of this ſacrament, they will be <hi>obliged</hi> to be <hi>more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> in their <hi>deportment;</hi> and that the ſame evil action would be more criminal in them, ſhould they become communicants, than it is while they do not receive this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Such conduct muſt evince great <hi>depravity</hi> of heart, as well as <hi>ignorance</hi> of the nature of chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>What <hi>new</hi> obligation of virtue is enjoined upon us when we <hi>receive</hi> this ſacrament?</p>
            <p>When we ſubmit to the ordinance of baptiſm, are we not obligated to perform <hi>each duty</hi> of our religion, to the utmoſt of our ability?</p>
            <p>We hope however, for the honor of chriſtianity, there are but <hi>few,</hi> who, from this <hi>miſtaken idea,</hi> decline the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of this ſacrament.</p>
            <p>To conclude. Let ſuch as <hi>are communicants,</hi> approach this holy ordinance with reverence; with hearts of humility, faith, ſincerity, charity, purity and gratitude!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="unknown:021347_0074_0FB31C5D98BA3340"/>That they may be duly thankful for the love of Chriſt, which they will recogniſe, let them reflect on the <hi>dignity</hi> of his character; upon "the length and breadth, depth and height" of his ſufferings; and upon the <hi>happy effects</hi> of his paſſion; that it will not only deliver them from everlaſting and inexpreſſible infamy and woe, but exalt them to never ending and inconceivable honor, glory and happineſs!</p>
            <p>And let ſuch humbly aſſure themſelves, that the divine Saviour will graciouſly condeſcend to meet them at his table; to indulge them with his ſmiles; to repleniſh their hearts with grace; to favour them with his bleſſing!</p>
            <p>Let the <hi>ſincere chriſtian,</hi> who, through <hi>groundleſs ſcruples</hi> and <hi>fears,</hi> hath been <hi>prevented</hi> from <hi>receiving</hi> this <hi>ſacrament,</hi> riſe ſuperior to all oppoſition in the performance of this duty!</p>
            <p>From an ardent deſire to render obedience to the will of Heaven; from an humble reliance on the divine goodneſs to pity his infirmities, and from a deſire to make advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the chriſtian life, let him reſolve, in as perfect a manner as poſſible, to commemorate the love of the merciful Saviour!</p>
            <p>Let <hi>thoſe</hi> who have been <hi>inattentive</hi> to this <hi>ſacred inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> who have not perhaps, beſtowed on it <hi>one ſerious thought,</hi> be intreated, without delay, to take it into their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration!</p>
            <p>That this ſacrament might be enforced on us in the moſt ſolemn manner, our Saviour, as it ſhould ſeem, enjoined it upon us in his <hi>laſt moments,</hi> almoſt with his lateſt breath! It is equally obligatory on <hi>all</hi> the members of his church; and we have not the leaſt intimation, that any apology will be admitted for a diſregard of this ordinance!</p>
            <p>And let ſuch perſons be prevailed on to enter into the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>chriſtianity;</hi> to pay attention to each part of their duty, that they may enjoy the pleaſures ariſing from a good conſcience; participate of the ſublime enjoyments of religion here, and of it's inexpreſſible rewards hereafter!</p>
            <p>That <hi>ſuch</hi> may be their <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>happineſs,</hi> will God Almighty of his infinite mercy, be graciouſly pleaſed to grant;
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:021347_0075_0FB31C5F2B0E08A0"/>
for the ſake of the merits of the divine compaſſionate Jeſus; to whom with the Father, and divine Spirit, be aſcribed all honor and glory, adoration and praiſe, now, henceforth, and for ever!</p>
