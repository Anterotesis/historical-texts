            <title>The book of the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which were to come to pass; and Jesus Christ sent and signifyed it by his angel to his servant John. And now by revelation, hath opened the mystery contained in said book unto his servant John Rogers, who hath explained the same for the edification and comfort of his church and people, after a long and dark night of apostacy; the explanation being made so plain, that the eye of every spiritual reader may see how exactly things have come to pass, as they were foretold of by the prophecy of this Book: and may see by it all things which are yet to come, not only to the end of this world, but to the finishing of the world to come.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>THE Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, which God gave unto him, to ſhew unto his ſervants things which muſt ſhortly come to paſs: and he ſent and ſignified it by his angel to his ſervant John,</p>
               <p>Who was required to write them in a Book and to ſend it to the ſeven Churches of Aſia, as in <hi>v.</hi> 11. Accordingly John attended his order, as appears <hi>v.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 2. Who bear record of the word of God, and of the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, and of all things that he ſaw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 3. Bleſſed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this propheſie, and keep thoſe things which are written therein, for the time is at hand.</p>
               <p>In this third verſe there is a bleſſed Promiſe, both to the reader and hearer of the propheſie of this Book, when they
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002172_0003_0FBC79F142C14AB0"/>take heed to keep thoſe things which are written therein; which Verſe ſhews it is not a ſeal'd Book but may be read and underſtood by God's Church, tho' faſt ſeal'd up and not to be underſtood by the falſe Church, as appears, Iſai. 29.11, &amp;c. <hi>And the viſion of all is become unto you as the words of a Book that is ſealed, which men deliver unto one that is learned, ſaying, read this I pray thee, and he ſaith, I cannot for it is ſealed: and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 4. John to the ſeven Churches which are in Aſia.</p>
               <p>This is the Superſcription of his Book by intimating to whom he directs it to;</p>
               <p>Grace be unto you, and peace from him which is, and which was, and which is to come.</p>
               <p>Thus he Salutes them in that grace and mercy which they were made partakers of from God the Father under theſe terms, to wit, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why doth John declare God the Father in theſe terms?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he declared himſelf ſo to John before, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in <hi>v.</hi> 8. of this Chap. <hi>I am Alpha and O mega, ſaith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2dly. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why doth John ſay</p>
               <p>And from the ſeven ſpirits which are before his throne</p>
               <p>Seeing the ſpirit of God is but one?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="unknown:002172_0003_0FBC79F142C14AB0"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He expreſſeth it as in the viſion he ſaw it before the throne of God, as it appears in the 4th Chap. of this book, 5th Verſe. <hi>And there was ſeven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the ſeven ſpirits of God;</hi> thus John followeth the Viſion and writeth things as they were revealed to him, calling the holy Spirit of God as he ſaw it, by the number SEVEN, tho' it be but one eternal Spirit in it ſelf; yet as it is diſtributed by meaſure to ſeven Churches, it bears the name Seven. But I purpoſe to ſpeak more fully to this in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing part of the Chapter, when I come to ſpeak of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Stars, and the ſeven golden Candle-ſticks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 5. And from Jeſus Chriſt who is the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful witneſs, and the firſt begotten of the dead, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus it appears, that grace and mercy was extended from theſe Three to the ſeven Churches, <hi>to wit,</hi> from God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and from the Spirit, and from Jeſus Chriſt the ſon of the Father, who is the faithful witneſs of theſe things contained in this book of the revelation; and the firſt begotten of the dead to life again, by the reſurrection of his body which was crucified on the croſs: And tho' theſe are three diſcoveries of God, yet they are in union but one God. And this Jeſus Chriſt is the Prince of the Kings of the earth, who hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us and waſhed us from our ſins in his own Blood, this is to be underſtood through the ſanctification of the Spirit which purifies the heart and inward parts of a ſinner, according to <hi>David</hi>'s words, <hi>Waſh me and I ſhall be whiter than ſnow.</hi> Pſal. 51.7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 6. And hath made us Kings and Prieſts unto God and his Father, to him be glory and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion for ever and ever, Amen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 7. Behold he cometh with clouds, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very eye ſhall ſee him, and they alſo which pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him, and all the kindreds of the earth ſhall wail becauſe of him, even ſo, Amen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe,</hi> 8. I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending ſaith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almightie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002172_0004_0FBC79F34171CFE0"/>
Yea he is both God and man, as appears Rom. 9.5. <hi>And of whom as concerning the fleſh Chriſt came, who is over all God bleſſed forever. Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 9. I John, who alſo am your brother and companion in tribulation, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This is an evidence that God's faithful children (while in this world) are companions with John in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jeſus Chriſt; and John's patience is a preſident for us who are in the kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt and in this troubleſome world, to be patient in tribulation, that thereby we may gain experience.</p>
               <p>I was <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> in the Iſle that is called Patmos.</p>
               <p>Here he gives us an account where he was when he had this viſion revealed to him, it was upon an Iſland, no doubt but where he was retire for the word of God, and for the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of Jeſus Chriſt. Here it appears that this book of the Revelation is a record of the word of God, and of the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of Jeſus Chriſt to his ſervant John.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. I was in the ſpirit on the Lords day.</p>
               <p>This was the Lords day of the Revelation of the things contained in this Book, and John was the perſon that was to tarry till Chriſt did come and make them known to him, as appears by what the Lord Jeſus hinted to Peter long before the time was come, even when he gave Peter that ſolemn charge to feed his lambs &amp; ſheep, bidding Peter follow him; upon which charge given to Peter, and Peter ſeeing John following, he queries of Jeſus concerning John, what was for him to do, as is to be ſeen, Joh. 21.20. &amp;c. <hi>Then Peter turning about, ſeeth the diſciple whom Jeſus loved following; Peter ſeeing him, ſaith to Jeſus, Lord, and what ſhall this man do? Jeſus ſaith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee, follow thou me: Then went this ſaying abroad among the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that this diſciple ſhould not die; yet Jeſus ſaid not unto him, no ſhall not die, but if I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee.</hi> From hence we may obſerve that the Lord Jeſus hinted to Peter that he had a work alſo for his ſervant John to do, tho' then not underſtood by the brethren who thought he ſhould not die, but now the Lords day of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of what is contained in this book is come, for John
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002172_0004_0FBC79F34171CFE0"/>hath now tarried till the Lord is come, as appears, in the 18th and 19th verſes, <hi>I am he that liveth and was dead, &amp;c. Write the things which thou haſt ſeen, and the things which are, and the things which ſhall be hereafter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some have groundleſly and ſcriptureleſly imagined this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to be on a firſt day of the Week, but ſeeing no ſuch thing is revealed in the book, neither is it a material thing to the opening of the hiſtory it ſelf, it is altogether fruitleſs; for reaſon it ſelf will tell us, that it contained ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time more than one day, for John wrote thoſe viſions as he ſaw and heard them, as throughout the book it ſelf appears; as for inſtance, Chap. 10.4. <hi>And when the ſeven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write, and I heard a voice from heaven, ſaying to me, ſeal up thoſe things which the ſeven thunders uttered, and write them not.</hi> Thus the Lords day of revelations and viſions which John ſaw, continued till he had accompliſhed the writing of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 11. Saying I am Alpha and Omega, the firſt and the laſt, and, What thou ſeeſt write in a book, and ſend it to the ſeven churches which are in Aſia, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This is the voice of the Authority of the Majeſty of God, requiring and commanding John to write in a Book this viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ſhould be ſet before his eyes, and to ſend it to the aforeſaid Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 12. And I turned to ſee the voice that ſpake with me.</p>
               <p>This great voice ſpeaking behind the Apoſtle cauſed him to turn about,</p>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> firſt is, the voice came from the four horns of the golden altar. And ſecondly, it was directed to the angel which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> required him to looſe the four angels that was bound in the great River Euphrates.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We are to conſider, the four horns of the Altar from whence the voice came, pointed every ways, both north, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Secondly, We ſhall find that the voice that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> directed to the angel which had founded the ſixth trumpet, did command him to looſe the four Angels that was bound in the great river Euphrates. And,</p>

Thirdly, That theſe four angels did repreſent to John, how tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fourthly, It is neceſſary to know what is intended by their being bound in the great River Euphrates. Euphrates was a river that did belong to old Babylon, as may be ſeen, Jer. 51.60. &amp;c. And their being bound in ſaid River, doth ſhew that they were bound under the power and Dominion of Myſtical Babylon, even under Apollyons doctrine and de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>luſions: but after that this angel had ſounded the ſixth trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, which was to give notice what was to follow, and that which followed was a command to him that had ſounded that is the ſixth Angel, to looſe the four Angels, that they might be prepared at an hour, and a Day, and a month, and, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Poſſibly here is mentioned a certain number for an uncertain; and this army were ſuch as were bound in the great river Euphrates before the ſixth Angel ſounded; but upon his ſounding, they are looſed in every quarter, and prepared to be in a readineſs, at the pouring out of the ſixth viol; for then the great river Euphrates will be dried up, as may be ſeen in Chap. 16.12. <hi>And the ſixth Angel pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered out his viol upon the great river Euphrates, and the waters thereof were dried up; that the way of the kings of the eaſt night be prepared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This alludes from the deſtruction of old Babylon, by the Meads and Perſians, who came out of the eaſt, and by trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es dryed up the great river Euphrates, by which means her deſtruction came; for by that means they entred the city, and ſo took it.

And their teſtimony that iſſueth out of their mouth, is compared to fire, ſmoke and brimſtone; for it is a myſtical battel, ſuch a battel as Chriſt's ſoldiers were wont to fight; as for inſtance, 1 Cor. 15.32. <hi>If after the manner of men I have fought with beaſts at Epheſus, what advantageth it me, if the dead riſe not at all.</hi> Theſe beaſts were ſuch Locuſts as theſe which are here ſpoken of, and the war is ſuch a myſtical war, as the Apoſtle ſaith in another place, <hi>I have fought a good ſight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.3, 4. <hi>Thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endure hardneſs as a good ſoldier of Jeſus Chriſt.

               <p>This Apollion and his army in this warfare, warreth againſt the ſaints by perſecution, there being out few ſuch counſellors among them as Gamaliel was, Acts. 5.38, 39. <hi>And now I ſay unto you, refrain from theſe men, and let them alone; for if this counſel or this work be of men, it will come to nought, but if it be of God ye cannot overthrow it, leſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ye be found even to fight againſt God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas it is ſaid of this ſelect army, that their power is in their mouth; this is no new thing; but that which hath always appeared in this warfare; that is, that the enemies of God's Church hath ever been deſtroyed by that which came out of the mouths of the ſaints, who warred againſt their enemies and oppreſſors. As for inſtance, all thoſe Judgments which came upon Egypt, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd by the mouth of Moſes, before they were executed on the Egyptians; for God was always wont (as appears by the teſtimony of the Scriptures) to denounce his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by the mouth of this ſelect army, before the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, as appears throughout the books of the old teſtament, Hoſea 6.5. <hi>Therefore I have hewed them by the Prophets, I have ſtain them by the words of my mouth.</hi> Jer. 51.20, 21. <hi>Thou art my battel ax, and weapons of war, for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I deſtroy kingdoms, and with thee will I break in pieces the horſe and his rider, and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider.</hi> 2 King. 1.10. <hi>And Elijah anſwered and ſaid to the captain of fifty, If I he a man of God, let five come down from heaven and conſume thee and thy fifty;

               <p>This verſe ſheweth us, as they repented not of their Idolatries; ſo likewiſe they repented not of their murders, that is, their perſecution, or murdering the ſaints; for it is ſaid of this falſe Church, Chap. 18.24. <hi>For in her was found the blood of the prophets, and of ſaints, and of all that were ſlain upon the earth.</hi> This laſt ſentence, to wit, all that were ſlain upon the earth, is to be underſtood, all that were ſlain by perſecution, were murdered by this Church.</p>

                  <hi>Neither repented they of their fornication:</hi> That is to be underſtood of their ſpiritual whoredom; for this Church which this Chapter is treating upon, was not only the Synagogue of Satan, coming out of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs pit, but the mother of harlots or fornications; as is to be ſeen, Chap. 17.5.</p>
               <p>

Here are ſeveral things to be obſerved from this verſe: The firſt is God's promiſe to give power to his two witneſſes, to prophecy; and ſecondly, What are we to underſtand by prophecy? I anſwer, it is the gift of God, as in the foregoing words, I will give power unto my two witneſſes, or I will give unto my two witneſſes, and they ſhall prophecy. So that it appears, none can prophecy but by the gift of God, that is, by the gift of his ſpirit, for prophecy comes by the revelation of God's ſpirit; <hi>for no man can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord but by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.3. for it is the ſpirit of God that reveals him to us to be the Lord; <hi>for the testimony of Jeſus is the ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,</hi> Chap. 19.10. And thirdly, the time here ſpoken of their prophecy, is a thouſand two hundred and ſixty days, which time, reckoning thirty days to a month, makes juſt forty and two months, which meaſures the ſame time that the Gentiles tread the holy city under foot, ſpoken of in the foregoing verſe; for the time of theſe witneſſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy is meaſured by the day which is ruled by the ſun, becauſe they are children of light and of the day; but the Gentiles are children of the night and of darkneſs, and their time is meaſured by months or moons. And the fourth thing is their ſad and mournful ſtate in the time of this prophecy, which is ſignified by their being <hi>cloathed in ſackcloth.</hi> And fifthly, let us inquire, Who theſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes be, and why they are called two? Why they are called two, is ſhewed in the fourth verſe; theſe are the two olive trees, and the two candleſticks ſtanding before the God of the earth. The Church of Chriſt is called an olive tree under the firſt teſtament, as plainly appears in <hi>Jer.</hi> 11. comparing the 15th verſe with the 16th. <hi>What hath my beloved to do in mine houſe, ſeeing ſhe hath committed lewdneſs with many, &amp;c. The Lord called thy name a green olive tree, fair and of goodly fruit.</hi> Thus it appears the olive tree did figure the Church, as is to be ſeen alſo in Rom. 11.24. <hi>For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is mild by nature, and wert graffed in contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more ſhall theſe which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree.</hi> Thus both the Church of the Jews under the firſt teſtament, and the Church of the Gentiles under the new teſtament,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:002172_0051_0FBC7A51B8FB3820"/>are compared to an olive tree; ſo that it appears evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Church of Chriſt is intended by ſhore witneſſes not only by the two olive trees, but alſo by the two can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks; for the Church of Chriſt under the old te ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was repreſented to Zechariah by a golden candleſtick, Zech 4.2. <hi>And he ſaid unto me what ſeeſt thou? And I ſaid, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold.</hi> And alſo the ſeven Churches of Aſia were repreſented to John by the ſeven golden candleſticks, Chap. 1.20. <hi>The ſeven golden candleſticks are the ſeven Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it appears that theſe witneſſes are the Church of Chriſt; for the olive tree and the candleſtick figured no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in the Scripture but the Church; ſo that they are very plainly deſcribed to be the Church of Chriſt And ſixthly, why are they called two witneſſes? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, in ſeveral reſpects; for under the law of Moſes, two witneſſes or three was to eſtabliſh the matter, Deut. 19 15. <hi>At the mouth of two witneſſes, or at the mouth of three witneſſes ſhall the matter be eſtabliſhed.</hi> And tho' the Church be many witneſſes, yet for ſeveral reaſons they are expreſs'd by the number two, that being a ſufficient proof under the law; and for ſeveral other reaſons as herein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 4. Theſe are the two olive trees and the two candleſticks ſtanding before the God of the earth.</p>
               <p>They are called two olive trees and two candleſticks ſtanding before the God of the earth. They are two in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the two natures in union. The oyl doth figure the Spirit of God which is divine; and the ſtock and branches doth figure the humane nature of Chriſt, and his Church: And thus in their teſtimony they are two joint witneſſes in every thing they witneſs to; and therefore their witneſs is called a prophecy; as for inſtance, Rom. 8.16. <hi>The ſpirit it ſelf in us is one, and its bearing witneſs with our ſpirit, makes two joint witneſſes,</hi> to confirm to us that we are the children of God. And it is ſaid they are two prophets and the two candleſticks, in reſpect of the two reſtaments they did teſtify under, meaſuring the Church of the Jews under the firſt teſtament to be one olive tree, and
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:002172_0051_0FBC7A51B8FB3820"/>one candleſtick; and the Church under the new teſtament to be the other olive tree and candleſtick, which makes two live trees and two candleſticks, ſtanding before the God of the earth, Zech. 4.2. <hi>I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of Gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his ſeven lamps thereon, and ſeven pipes to the ſeven lamps.</hi> This candleſtick with the ſeven lamps upon it, did repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Church under the old teſtament: Compare this with the 11th and 12th verſes, <hi>What are theſe two olive trees upon the right ſide of the candlestick, and upon the left ſide thereof? And I anſwered again and ſaid unto him, What he theſe two olive branches, which thro' the two golden pipes empty the golden oyl out of themſelves.</hi> Verſe 14. <hi>Then ſaid he, theſe are the two anointed ones, that stand by the God of the whole earth.</hi> And theſe two anointed ones that ſtood before the God of the whole earth, was Zerubbabel the Governour, and Joſhua the high Prieſt, who were types of Chriſt, and were two witneſſes under that miniſtration, who ſtood before the God of the whole earth, and did repreſent that union that is between Chriſt and his Church, they being compared to two olive trees, and two branches, which thro' the two golden pipes empty the golden oyl out of themſelves; that is, they were feeders and nouriſhers of the Church, and types of Chriſt, who is the chief and great Shepherd, the one of his kingly office, the other of his prieſtly office; but the two anointed ones in the my ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that ſtands before the God of the earth, is Chriſt and his Church, who are the two anointed ones. Heb. 1.9. <hi>Therefore God, even thy God, hath amo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nted thee with the oyl of gladneſs above thy fellows.</hi> 2 Cor. 1 21. <hi>Now he which ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God.</hi> Thus Chriſt and his Church are the two anointed ones, and the two witneſſes which ſtand before the God of the earth.</p>
               <p>But the Church under the old teſtament was called but one candleſtick: the uſe of the candleſtick is to hold the light; and the candleſtick that holds the ſeven lamps, if there be no oyl they can give no light, therefore the olive tree that yields the oyle ſtanding by the candleſtick, which candleſtick holds up the ſeven lamps, which hath ſeven
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:002172_0052_0FBC7A5377ABC138"/>pipes to feed the ſeven lamps; thus it cauſeth the lamps to give a continual light; thus the myſtery of the two natures of Chriſt is held forth by this figure: The can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick with its ſeven lamps holds forth the Church; and the olive tree holds forth Chriſt's humane nature with his Church, and the golden oyl his divine nature; ſo that as the oyl that flows from the olive tree, and feeds the lamps, and cauſeth them to give a continual light; ſo the Spirit of Chriſt that flows from himſelf into his Church, or members, feed and nouriſh them, ſo that they become the light of the world: So that Jeſus Chriſt the true olive tree, and his Church in union with him, are the two witneſſes that always ſtand before the God of the earth, and bear witneſs to the truth: Thus the Spirit and the Bride are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led two olive trees, and two candleſticks, becauſe under two miniſtrations, to wit, under the old teſtament and under the new: And thus they ſtand before the God of the earth, and are the light of the world, bearing witneſs to the truth which is revealed in them by the Spirit of truth; and therefore their witneſs is by prophecy, ſo that Chriſt and his Church thus in union are called two prophets, and two witneſſes; Joh. 18.37. <hi>For this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould bear witneſs unto the truth.</hi> Chap. 1.5. <hi>And from Jeſus Chriſt who is the faithful witneſs.</hi> Acts 1.8. <hi>But ye ſhall receive power after that the Holy Ghoſt is come upon you; and ye ſhall be witneſſes unto me, both in Jeruſalem and in Judea, and in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth.</hi> Thus God gives power unto his witneſſes; as alſo in Acts 5.32. <hi>And we are his witneſſes of theſe things, and ſo is alſo the holy Ghoſt whom God hath given to them that obey him:</hi> Here are the two witneſſes ſpoken of in union, to wit, they with the holy Ghoſt which is in them; for the witneſs of the holy Ghoſt which is in them, is the witneſs of Jeſus Chriſt with his Church; and that which they witneſs to is that which God hath revealed to them by his Spirit, ſo that their teſtimony is by the Spirit of prophecy, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 2.20. compared with the <hi>26th and 27th verſes,</hi> bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the truth, againſt all falſe worſhip ſet up in the world by the inſtitution, laws and appointments of men,

               <p>That is, by the fire that cometh out of their mouth; for God is wont always to denounce his Judgments by the mouth of theſe witneſſes, before he executes them, as he did by the mouth of Elijah. And ſuch warriers as Elijah was, is ſhewed in the 9th Chap. 18. verſe. <hi>By theſe three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the ſmoke, and by the breaſt ne which iſſued out of their mouths.</hi>

               <p>This is an alluſion from the prayer of Elijah, who prayed earneſtly that it might not rain, and it rained not on the earth by the ſpace of three years and ſix months. And this judgment of famine came upon Iſrael for the hurt done to the ſervants of God, in the reign of Ahab king of Iſrael; and not only this famine, but the utter deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ahab and all his houſe, and all Baals Prieſts, and worſhippers of Baal, were utterly deſtroyed in a juſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for the hurt done to the ſervants of God: And this was done in ſuch a time as this was; for then the
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:002172_0053_0FBC7A54B6D5D780"/>two witneſſes did prophecy in ſackcloth, and the true Church was trodden under foot by Jezabel, who had the ſame meaſure after meaſured to her, who was after trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under foot her ſelf, and eaten up of dogs. But theſe having power to ſhut up heaven that it rain not, doth hold forth a myſtery in it, altho' it be an alluſion from that judgment executed from the mouth of Elijah (1 King. 17.1. <hi>And Elijah ſaid unto Ahab, as the Lord Lord God of Iſrael liveth, there ſhall not be dew nor rain theſe years but according to my word,</hi>) in that God thus ſhut heaven at his requeſt, that it rained not for three years and ſix months in that time of falſe and fruitleſs doctrine; for there can be no heavenly ſhowers to cauſe the earth to yield her increaſe, under the teaching of a falſe miniſtry; for in ſuch a time there is a drought, for a falſe miniſtry are <hi>clouds without water,</hi> Jude 12. Amos 8.11, 12, 13. <hi>Behold the days come faith the Lord God, that I will ſend a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing of the words of the Lord; and they ſhall wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from ſea to ſea, and from the north even to the east, they ſhall run to and fro to ſeek the word of the Lord, and ſhall not find it; in that day ſhall the fair virgins &amp; young men faint for thirst.</hi> For all the heavenly ſhowers of fruitfulneſs is by the prophecy that comes by the Spirit of God, and not by a viſion of the immagination of a mans own heart, but by the prophecy of the two witneſſes, which is the Spirit and the Bride, out of whoſe belly flows rivers of living waters, and watereth the earth; for they only are the light of the world. And faith the Apoſtle,</p>
               <p>Theſe have power over water to turn them to blood, and to ſmite the earth with all plagues as often as they will.</p>
               <p>This is an alluſion from what Moſes and Aaron did in Egypt, who turned the waters of Egypt into blood, and ſmote the Egyptians with all thoſe great plagues, in a juſt judgment for the oppreſſion and cruelty done to the diſraelites: And this prophecy is to ſhew, that God is the ſame God, ready to execute his judgments on them that hurt his witneſſes, as if it were done at their will.

               <p>ANd I ſtood upon the ſand of the ſea.</p>
               <p>Thus it appeared unto John in his viſion, as if he ſtood on the ſand of the ſea; ſo that he had a fair proſpect to behold the face of the waters.</p>
               <p>And I ſaw a beaſt riſe out of the ſea.</p>
               <p>This beaſt is the kingdoms of this world, and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Roman kingdom, who had rule at that time. And by the waters is meant <hi>peoples and multitudes, and nations and tongues,</hi> as appears Chap. 17.15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.53. And by the <hi>heads of the boaſt</hi> is meant the dominion of this world: And the number <hi>ſeven</hi> meaſures the whole dominion or government of this world: And the <hi>ten horns</hi> is to expreſs many kingly powers that ariſeth out of the ſeven heads; for it is ſaid in Chap. 17.9, 10. <hi>The ſeven heads are ſeven mountains, and the ſeven mountains</hi> repreſent all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 2. And the beaſt which I ſaw was like a leopard, and his feet as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion.</p>
               <p>Thus God repreſents the kingly powers of this world by the moſt fierceſt wild beaſts, who are fierce and ſtrong, and able thereby to deſtroy and overcome the beaſts of the earth. And the Prophet Daniel Chap. 7. ſaw the like viſion of the four Monarchs, repreſented to him by the like fierce beaſts; but Daniel prophecied in the firſt Monarch, and John in the time of the laſt. Now theſe kings and powers were ſet up by God to do juſtice and judgment among the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth. And this beaſt here ſpoken of is not yet repreſented to John of a ſcarlet colour, becauſe its power is of God, according to Paul's teſtimony, Rom. 13.1, &amp;c. <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers; for there is no power but of God, the powers that are ordained of God.</hi> This Apoſtle is ſpeaking of the ſame power that John is prophecying of, to wit, the Roman kingdom then ruling.</p>
               <p>And the dragon gave him his power, and his ſeat, and great authority.</p>

Yea, he is the God of this world, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.30.

               <p>This was one of the ſeven heads of the dragon which he gave to the beaſt; for that power which is derived from God is not to be wounded, but is to continue to the worlds end: Now if the dragon had not the dominion of this world, he could not be the god of it. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>

               <p>From hence we may note, how God threatens his ſevere judgments with a loud voice, ſince his Church begins to ariſe and ſtand upon her feet, ſaying, <hi>If any man worſhip the beaſt and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand, the ſame ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture, into the Cup of his indignation; and he ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone, in the preſence of his holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb.</hi> This is to expreſs his fiery anger againſt them, and to ſet forth their perpetual tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the preſence of thoſe holy angeis and of that Lamb which we before read of ſtanding on mount Sion; and he expreſſeth their torment to be as if it were with burning fire and brimſtone.</p>

And theſe kings of the earth are the kings of this world, that have committed fornication with this falſe Church in joining in with her, being deceived by her; and theſe armies are the inhabitants of the earth, that are drunken with the wine of her fornication; theſe are they that are gathered together to make war againſt him whoſe name is called the Word of God; for theſe are they that worſhip the beaſt and his image, and have given a mark in their right hand or in their forehead; that is, they yielded obedience to the image, or form of worſhip, ſet up by the kingly or magiſtratical powers of this world.

And hath raiſed us up together, and made us to ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> This is the firſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, which all ſaints have a part in. But this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy hath relation to a time of a general reſurrection of the Church of Chriſt, after a long time of their death and ſorrow; and of their flouriſhing ſtate that ſhall follow for the ſpace of a thouſand years in this world. As to their death, it may be thus conſidered: The Church of Sardis did ſo decay and dye from that ſpiritual life that they were once in, that <hi>they had a name to live when in truth they were dead,</hi> Chap. 3.1. And after this we read of a ſtar that fell from heaven, which the third trumpet gave notice of, and it fell upon the third part of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and upon the fountains of waters, and ſo imbittered them, that many men died of the waters, becauſe they were made bitter; this was by drinking in corrupt doctrine, which this falling ſtar brought into the Church, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which many in the Church decayed and dyed from that ſpiritual life which before they lived in, when they were nouriſhed with living fountains of water, which was good and wholeſom doctrine. Thus death and darkneſs came upon the Church, and great miſeries and afflictions fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; ſo that ſhe came to be troden under foot, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied a long time cloathed in ſackloth; and their dead bodys was ſeen to lye in the ſtreet of the great city, which was ſpiritually called Sodom and Egypt, and where alſo our Lord was crucifyed; and her enemies did rejoyce
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:002172_0116_0FBC7ADD513B58B0"/>over her, and did overcome her, and did kill her: This was her death. But we are now come to ſuch a time and age of the world, that all her enemies are now ſubdued, and the day of her riſing, living, and reigning with Chriſt is come, and will continue a long time, that is for the ſpace of a thouſand years.

                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. And he ſaith unto me, ſeal not the ſayings of the prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand.</p>
               <p>Here is two things to be obſerved from this verſe: The firſt is, the charge that the Angel gives John (when he had made known theſe things to John) not to ſeal them, in theſe words, ſaying, Seal not the ſayings of the prophecy of this book. Thus it appears, that John was required to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe theſe things upon his knowledge of them. And the ſecond thing is, the reaſon which is given him why he ſhould not ſeal them, for ſaith the Angel, The time is at hand. Thus it appears, that John was required forth with to make publication of them upon the conſideration that the time was at hand; ſo that the ſeven churches of Aſia, to whom they did concern, might be warned to prepare themſelves for thoſe things which were then at hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 11. He that is unjuſt let him be unjuſt ſtill, and he which is filthy let him be filthy ſtill, and he that is righteous let him be righteous ſtill, and he that is holy let him be holy ſtill.</p>
               <p>By the following verſe the reaſon will be ſeen why the Angel ſaith thus concerning the ſtate of the unjuſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, and concerning the ſtate of the righteous and holy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 12. And behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as his work ſhall be.</p>
               <p>And behold I come quickly, ſaith the Lord. Here he gives warning of his ſpeedy coming, to the unjuſt, and to the filthy, and to the righteous, and to the holy; and that he will bring his reward with him to give unto every one
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:002172_0131_0FBC7AFC20BEEF40"/>of them according as his work ſhall be. And thus at his coming, he will reward the unjuſt and unholy according as their work ſhall be: And to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and holy according to their work. This coming quickly is in judgment to the wicked, &amp; with a good reward to the righteous; ſo that the Lord here ſpeaks unto the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, after this manner, when I come with my reward, let him be unjuſt ſtill, for the day of his grace is now paſt, and ſo let it be with the unholy, for he likewiſe hath outgone the day of his grace, and therefore if the unjuſt and the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, will run the hazard of ſuch an unjuſt and filthy ſtate, I will come quickly upon them with my reward; and this is to forewarn the unjuſt and filthy of the great Hazard they ſtand in, while in that hazardable ſtate. And to encourage the righteous and holy ſo to continue that they might not loſe their reward. But to take this ſaying in ſhort it carries with it implicitly, as if the Lord ſhould ſay to the unjuſt &amp; filthy, to the righteous and holy, even to them all, Behold I come quickly to reward every one of you according to your work and as I find you, ſo I will reward you, and ſo you ſhall ever remain, in that ſtate I find you in at my coming; ſo your reward ſhall be, and in that ſtate ſhall you remain, that is, the unjuſt under the reward of the unjuſt, and the filthy under the reward of the filthy, and the righteous under the reward of the righteous, and the holy under the reward of the holy. And this coming quickly is ſuch a coming as he foretold of to ſeveral of the churches of Aſia, Chap. 2.5.16. <hi>Repent or elſe I will come unto you quickly.</hi> 25. v. <hi>But that which ye have already hold faſt till I come.</hi> chap. 3.3. <hi>If therefore thou ſhalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief and thou ſhalt not know what hour I will come on thee.</hi> chap. 3.11. <hi>Behold I come quickly, hold that faſt which thou haſt.</hi> Mat. 24.50, 51. <hi>The Lord of that ſervant ſhall come in a day, when he looketh not for him, and in a hour that he is not ware of, and ſhall cut him aſunder, and appoint him his portion with the Hypocrites, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth</hi> Matt. 25.6. <hi>And at midnight there was a crie made, behold the. bridegroom cometh.</hi>

               <p>This verſe contains the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt to three things: His firſt teſtimony is, that he ſent his Angel to teſtify theſe things in the Churches. Thus it appears that this book was ſign'd to (at the end of it) by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, to confirm the truth of it. And ſecondly, he teſtify that he is both the root &amp; offspring of David: Thus he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himſelf to be God and Man; for if he be the roo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and offspring of David, David muſt be a branch of of his root. And if he be the offspring of David, then of neceſſity David muſt be the root of him. Thus it appears that he is both David's Lord, and David's Son. And thirdly, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himſelf to be the bright and morning Star; this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to his miniſterial office, for the miniſters of the ſeven Churches are repreſented in the likeneſs of ſtars; but the Lord Jeſus is the moſt excellent and brighteſt ſtar of all the miniſters; and promiſeth in Chap. 2.28. <hi>To him that overcometh and keepeth his works to the end, to give him the morning star;</hi> That is, he ſhall be the brighteſt ſtar in all the Churches.</p>

                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 17. And the ſpirit and the bride ſay come, and let him that heareth ſay come, and let him that is athirſt come, and whoſoever will let him take of the water of life freely.</p>
               <p>This verſe conſiſteth of moſt gracious invitations, both by the ſpirit and by the bride, who are one in union, that is Chriſt and his church, expreſſeth a full and free invitation to all to come into the holy city, to drink of the water of life, and that freely. And ſecondly withall bids him that
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:002172_0132_0FBC7AFE35C08750"/>heareth this invitation to invite others to come. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This verſe contains a ſevere threatning, to every man that hears the propheſy of this book, that if any man ſhall add unto the things therein contained, God ſhall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 19. And if any man ſhall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God ſhall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.</p>
               <p>This verſe likewiſe contains a ſevere threatening againſt any that ſhall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, how that God ſhall take away his part out of the book of life, and alſo out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.</p>

               <p>This is a gracious promiſe to all thoſe that are looking and waiting for his coming for their help, when they are in trouble and diſtreſs for his ſake; but it will be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive coming to the wicked that are not ware of it: This coming is a myſtical coming, and not a perſonal and viſible coming, (as will be at the great and laſt day of Judgment when every eye ſhall ſee him) but ſuch a coming as is proved by Scripture teſtimony in the ſeventh verſe of this Chapter.
