            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>LUKE XI. 13.</bibl>
               <q>If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your Children: how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the beginning of this Chapter, one of Chriſt's Diſciples ask'd our Lord to teach them to Pray; in anſwer to which requeſt, this great Prophet and Teacher of His Church, gives His Diſciples an excellent Form or Pattern as a Rule for their Direction in Prayer; which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in this and the Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew,</hi> with ſome conſiderable difference. And He encourageth them to continue inſtant in Prayer, with perſevering Importunity, by declaring that if they Ask it ſhall be given them; that if they ſeek, they ſhall find, and that if they Knock it ſhall be

open'd to them. And our Lord illuſtrates and confirms this Truth by a double ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude or compariſon. The firſt is that of a <hi>Friend,</hi> who is moved by importunity to grant his friend's requeſt, being urg'd to that which his kindneſs as a friend was not ſufficient to incline him to. The ſecond is taken from an <hi>earthly Father,</hi> whoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental love to his Child will not by any means, ſuffer him to give that which he knows to be hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tful, when his Child asks what is needful and proper to be given, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12. And then follows my <hi>text,</hi> in which we have the ſimilitude form'd into an Argument by way of Compariſon, from the leſs to the greater, <hi>If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more ſhall your heavenly father give his holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> If ye who are evil, who have, even the natural Affection God hath given you towards your Children impair'd and vitiated by Sir; and compard with God, have no goodneſs in you; <hi>for there is none good but God;</hi> if ye have both knowledge and will to give good things to your Children; and who is there that hath not, who is not a monſter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out natural affection; <hi>How much more ſhall your heavenly.

            </p>
            <p>Anſ <hi>THE Third perſon in the Godhead.</hi> The word here us'd for Spirit ſignifies <hi>Breath</hi> or <hi>Wind:</hi> And it is obſerv'd by a learned Man, that the Word for Spirit in the <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> ſignifies Breath.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003103_0006_0FEFA671FB5CCAE8"/>
Now by this Word the Divine <hi>Eſſence</hi> which is pure and ſpiritual, immaterial and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, is ſometimes ſignified, in which the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt are <hi>One.</hi> But then, as this Name is in a peculiar manner given to the Holy Ghoſt, ſo it declares His eſpecial manner and order of ſubſiſtence in relation to the Father and the Son, as He proceeds from them. Now it is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious that the Third Perſon in the <hi>Trinity</hi> is often call'd by this Name in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and by a Name of the like ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in the <hi>Old.</hi> Thus in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Gen. 1.2. <hi>The Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters, Pſal.</hi> 336. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3.

            <p n="2">II. <hi>IN what reſpects is God ſaid to give, the Holy Spirit?</hi> Or thus, <hi>What is intended in God's giving the Holy Spirit?</hi> The Holy Spirit is in Scripture call'd the <hi>Gift of God,</hi> Joh. 4. 10. God is ſaid to give Him; <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16, 17. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, even the Spirit of truth.</hi> And agreable to this, ſuch as are made Partakers of this rich Gift, are ſaid to receive the Holy Ghoſt. 1 Cor. 2.12. <hi>We have received the Spirit which is of God.</hi> Our Heavenly Father gives His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to His Son our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as He is the Head of His Church, Joh. 3.34. —<hi>God giveth not the Spirit by meaſure unto him.</hi> He is the <hi>firſt Receiver,</hi> and thro Him God beſtows this great Gift upon His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

Act. 2.33. Therefore being by the right Hand of God exalted, and <hi>having received of the Father the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, be hath ſhed forth that which ye now ſee and hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I may ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. GOD's giving the Holy Spirit denotes <hi>His Authority and free Grace.</hi> This is a free Favour, and is of meer Grace, not of Debt. When we Pray for the Holy Ghoſt, we muſt come to the Throne of Grace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Money, and without Price. God hath Power to bellow Him, and He acts herein with Authority and the greateſt Freedom. We can do nothing to Purchaſe this Gift, or to oblige God to beſtow it upon us as a reward of Debt. No, we are unworthy of the leaſt of God's Mercies, much leſs can we in any meaſure deſerve this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Gift. Ability to Ask aright, and the thing beſtow'd in anſwer to our humble Petition, are both of the free Mercy of God thro' Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> of the Holy Spirit, p. 81.</note>. The Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Redemption purchaſed by Chriſt is peculiarly attributed to Him, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6.— According to his mercy he ſaved us, <hi>by the waſhing of regeneration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the holy Ghoſt; which was ſhed on us abundantly thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> He is the Good Spirit of God, and all good is from Him. And accordingly He is ſaid to be given with an eſpecial Regard to thoſe excellent Gifts, Graces and Comforts which are Communicated by Him. The Holy Spirit is in His Divine Nature one and <hi>the ſame,</hi> without variableneſs: But in His Gifts and Operations He is <hi>various,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.11. <hi>But all theſe (gifts) worketh that one and ſelf ſame Spirit—.</hi> Agreably we read of the <hi>ſeven Spirits of God,</hi> Rev. 4.5. i. e. the Holy Spirit in His manifold Diſpenſations of Gifts and Graces.

It is ſaid, that the Holy Ghoſt <hi>was not yet given—,</hi> or as in the Original, <hi>was not yet, becauſe
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003103_0011_0FEFA69C15B05670"/>
Jeſus was not yet glorified,</hi> Joh. 7.39. The Holy Ghoſt exiſted from Eternity; but He was not reſpecting that <hi>peculiar Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and manifeſtation of Him, which the Church was favour'd with, after Chriſt's Aſcenſion.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>WHAT is implied in Asking the Holy Spirit? How muſt we attend this Duty?</hi> Now as we have already obſerved, the Word ſignifies earneſtly to deſire any thing, and humbly to beg it. It intends humble and earneſt Prayer. And thus the Word is us'd, Jam. 1.5. If any of you lack wiſdom, <hi>let him ask of God—</hi> And then, we muſt Ask in a right manner, from a right principle, and for a right end.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IN Asking of God His Holy Spirit, <hi>we muſt offer up our hearty Deſires to Him.</hi> When we come before God to Ask His Holy Spirit, we muſt be duly ſenſible how needful and excellent a Bleſſing this is, and accordingly expreſs to God the inward deſires and breathings of our Souls after it. We muſt obey that Word, Pſal. 62, 8—. <hi>Pour out your hearts before him—.</hi> We muſt deſire and value this great Bleſſing, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe our Asking it will be but an empty Compliment, yea a mocking of God. We muſt thirſt for this living Water, the plentiful Effuſions of the Holy Spirit. As <hi>David</hi> longed, and ſaid, <hi>Oh that one would
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003103_0012_0FEFA6784C43D0F8"/>
give me drink of the water of the well of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Sam. 23.15.</note> So muſt we long for theſe holy Waters, and from our Hearts ſay, O that God wou'd Pour out His Spirit upon us! And then expreſs our hearty Deſires to God in Prayer. The thirſty are invited to Come and drink, <hi>Job.</hi> 7.37. There may be true Prayer without the <hi>Voice,</hi> but not without the <hi>Heart;</hi> there muſt be the Voice of the inward man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>WE muſt Ask of God His Holy Spirit in a due ſenſe of our own Sinfulneſs and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs.</hi> God gives Grace to the Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but knows the Proud afar off: And therefore when we come before Him with our Requeſts and Petitions, we muſt come under an abaſing ſenſe of our own empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unworthineſs. We muſt be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that we are empty of all ſpiritual Good, till the Holy Spirit is Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, and that we are leſs than the leaſt of God's Mercies, and therefore moſt unworthy of ſo great a Bleſſing. We muſt ask as Beggars ask an Alms. Thus the Word is uſed, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.2. As we are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually poor, ſo we muſt have a gracious Poverty of Spirit while attending this Duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WE muſt Ask <hi>in the Name of our Lord
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003103_0013_0FEFA69DB4B3D240"/>
Jeſus Chriſt, and in the exerciſe of Faith upon God as our Father in Him,</hi> Joh. 16.23.— Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my Name, he will give it you.</hi> ver. 24. — <hi>Ask, and ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive —.</hi> Our Saviour here requires His Diſciples to make an explicit and expreſs mention of His Name in Prayer. When we come before God, we muſt not come in our own name; but make mention of the Name of Chriſt, who is worthy, and hath purchaſed the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt to be Communicated to His People. Now asking in the Name of Chriſt doth not intend meerly our making mention of the Name of Chriſt in our Prayers, but alſo our believing and intire Dependance on Him, His Merit and Mediation, for audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and acceptance with God. He is our great <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> and our <hi>Advocate</hi> with the Father. He appears in the Preſence of God for us, as a Lamb that had been ſlain; His Blood was offer'd once for all, and it hath a Voice to plead for us; it ſpeaks <hi>better things than the blood of Abel.</hi> He ſits in Heaven as a Prieſt on a Throne, and is that <hi>Angel who offers much incenſe with the Prayers of the Saints</hi> upon the golden Altar which is before the Throne. And when the ſmoke of the Incenſe with the Prayers of the Saints,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003103_0014_0FEFA67DB827CB20"/>
aſcends up before God out of the Angel's Hand, God ſmells a ſweet ſavour in theſe ſpiritual Sacrifices, and hath a gracious regard unto them for His Son's ſake. See Rev. 8.3, 4. We then who are Sinners, and have our beſt Duties defil'd with this accurſed thing, muſt take our Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Merits of Chriſt, who hath a juſt Claim by Purchaſe, to this Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Bleſſing; and ask in His Name who is the Mediator between God &amp; Man. And then, having ſuch an High Prieſt, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Son of God, we ſhould <hi>come boldly to the Throne of Grace, thot we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need,</hi> Heb. 4.16. We muſt thro' Chriſt have our Faith in God, and come in humble Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as Children to a Father, believing that God is able and ready to beſtow a Fathers Bleſſing upon us. He that cometh to God muſt <hi>believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him,</hi> Heb. 11.6. We muſt believe that God is ſuch an One as He reveals Himſelf in His Word, and in the face of Jeſus Chriſt. Particularly, that He is rich in Mercy to all that Call upon Him. Without Faith we cannot pleaſe God in this Duty of Prayer, Jam. 1.6. <hi>Let him ask in Faith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wavering—.</hi> Believe, and you ſhall receive what you ask agreeable to God's
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003103_0015_0FEFA67AAF4C7D70"/>
Will, either <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> or in <hi>true value.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>WE muſt he ſervent, and continue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in this Duty.</hi> This we are taught in our Context, ver. 9, 10. We muſt ask, ſeek and knock. We muſt be importunate, as ver. 8. Jam. 5.16. —<hi>The effectual ſervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</hi> The <hi>inwrought Prayer.</hi> He that asks coldly, asks a dental<note n="†" place="bottom">Qui ſrigide rogat, docet negare.</note> We muſt be ſervent in Spirit if we would obtain the gracious Anſwer of our Prayers. We muſt ſtrive and wreſtle in holy earneſtneſs, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, whoſe wreſtling was accompanied <hi>with weeping and ſupplication,</hi> Hoſ. 12.4. And thus he had power over the <hi>Angel,</hi> over the <hi>Son of God,</hi> who is Jehovah, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed. If we would not ſeek in vain, we muſt approve ourſelves the genuine Sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and refuſe to let the Lord go till He bleſs us. I may ſay with great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that God delights to be thus over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by His People, i, e. <hi>He who is Almighty, is moſt willing to yield to their importunate Prayers,</hi> Again, we muſt continue inſtant in this Duty: As we are commanded. <hi>Rom,</hi> 12.12. We <hi>muſt pray always, watching there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto with perſeverance.</hi> Eph, 6.18. If God ſeem to ſhut out our Prayers, we muſt Pray the more earneſtly, and never ceaſe till we obtain the Anſwer of Prayer. Such
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003103_0016_0FEFA68006391420"/>
Petitions never return empty, but always obtain of God either the very thing we ask for, or that which is better for us.</p>
            <p>FROM what hath been ſaid of the nature of the Duty, and of the right manner of attending it, it is plain that the Asking here ſpoken of is a Duty which none but the Children of God, who have the Spirit of Adoption, can diſcharge aright; and they are oblig'd to ask that they may receive the Holy Ghoſt in more plentiful meaſures, which ſeems nextly intended in our Text, However, unregenerate Perſons are alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly obliged to attend this moral Duty of Prayer, and to ask of God the Spirit of Grace and Supplication, that they may do it in a light manner. That moral impotency which is natural to us ſince the Fall, and conſiſts very much in the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of our Wills againſt God &amp; His Law doth not abridge God's Power to Command. And then there are thoſe general Promiſes, If I may ſo call them, made to the Children and People of God, of the plentiful Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Spirit, as are a gracious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement even to ſuch as are now deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of ſaving Grace, to ask of God His Holy Spirit. Who knows, but you may be the happy Subjects of this great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit? It is not only poſſible, but probable, if you are now under the Convictions of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003103_0017_0FEFA69F411CF150"/>
God's Holy Spirit, O ſeek then, God is not wont utterly to forſake ſuch, unleſs they reſiſt His holy Spirit ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iving with them. I may further ſay, it is a much leſs evil to fail in the manner of our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending this Duty of Prayer, than wholly to neglect it.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>WHY ſhould we Ask of God His Holy Spirit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">Anſ. 1. <hi>BECAUSE this is God's Will and Command. God's Will</hi> reveal'd in His Word is to be made <hi>our Rule</hi> and Directory in Prayer, and in every part of Religious Worſhip. If we ask any thing of God it muſt be agreable to his Will, I <hi>Job.</hi> 5 14. This is the Confidence that we have in Him, <hi>that if we ask any thing according to his will, be he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reth us</hi> Now that this is the Will of God, our next and context ſnew us. And in thoſe Eva gel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which we have, <hi>Ezek</hi> 36. among which is that good Word, ver. 27. <hi>I will put my ſpirit within you.</hi> It is added ver. 37. Thus faith the Lord God, <hi>I will for this he inquired of by the houſe of Iſrael to do it for them.</hi> — God would do it; but in ſuch a manner that He would be acknowledged as the hearer of Prayer. The Bleſſing promiſed muſt be ſought of God, that it might be given in anſwer to Prayer. The Spirit of God is promis'd as a <hi>Spirit of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:003103_0018_0FEFA682749C8568"/>
Zech. 12. 10. And then it is promis'd in the beginning of the 13th. Chap. <hi>In that day there ſhall be a fountain open'd—.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>THE Advancement of the Glory of God and the Kingdom of Chriſt in the World, very much depends on this; and therefore we ſhould ask of God this great Bleſſing.</hi> Our Saviour hath directed us to Pray for the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God's Honour and Glory in the firſt place—. <hi>Hallowed be thy Name, thy Kingdom come, &amp;c.</hi> Now when we ask of God His Holy Spirit to be poured out upon us, upon our Children, and upon all Fleſh, we do in effect ask that God's Name may be hallowed, for we are utterly unable and indiſpoſed, yea averſe to this ſince the Fall, and muſt be formed by the Spirit of God to ſhew forth his Praiſe, if ever we give glory to Him in a right manner. We ſhall never ſanctify the Lord, unleſs He renew and ſanctify us by His Spirit. And then in order to the increaſing and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt's Kingdom, the Spirit of God muſt be poured out to qualify Miniſters to Preach the Goſpel of the Kingdom, and to make the Ordinances effectual to Salvation. Agreably our Saviour directed His Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to wait for the promiſe of the Father; aſſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

them, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.4,—8. And promis'd to ſend His holy Spirit, <hi>to reprove the World of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of Judgment,</hi> Joh, 16. 7, —11. If Sinners are convinced of the deadly evil of Sin, particularly of the Sin of <hi>Unbelief,</hi> and of the ſuitableneſs and ſufficiency of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs for their Juſtification in the ſight of God, it is the Holy-Spirit of God that wrought the Conviction. The Apoſtles themſelves were in this reſpect, <hi>but Miniſters by whom God's People believed, even as the Lord gave to every man,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.5. The quickning Influences of the Spirit are neceſſary to make the Ordinances a favour of life unto life. Men will not fear God, and give Glory to Him unleſs the Spirit of Grace come mightily upon them. When the, Word of God is accompanied by the Spirit, then the Son of God rides proſperouſly, and ſuch as were His Enemies fall down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>under Him, being ſubdued to the Obedience of Faith. Act. 2.41. <hi>Then they that gladly received his word, were baptized; and the ſome day there were added unto them about three thouſand ſouls.</hi> Surely then, we are oblig'd to ask of God His Holy Spirit, as we are oblig'd to ſeek the Glory of God, and the Advancement of His Kingdom among Men, God's Honour ſhould be nearer to us than any temporal Intereſt of our own.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:003103_0020_0FEFA684C528B978"/>3. <hi>THIS is the moſt needed and excellent Bleſſing.</hi> When God gives His Spirit, He bleſſeth His People with all ſpiritual Bleſſings in Heavenlies in Chriſt Jeſus, It is of the Spirit that God's People are <hi>born again,</hi> Joh. 3. 5. By the Spirit they are united to Chriſt, and ſo obtain an intereſt in all the ſaving Benefits He hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed. When God gives His Spirit, He gives Grace and Glory, and every good thing. All good things are either formally or virtually included in this Gift. And therefore we ſhould ask it of God, otherwiſe we ſhall he greatly wanting to our ſelves, and not conſult our beſt good and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>THIS is the way to obtain Outward good things with God's Bleſſing.</hi> If we do thus ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God, other things ſhall be added, "as far as ſhall be for God's Glory and our own good", and we ſhall have God's fatherly Bleſſing with them. Thus when God had promiſed of old to put His Spirit within His People, it follows,<hi>ye ſhall dwell in the land I gave to your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers—</hi>Ezek. 36.27, 28, 29. <hi>I will call for the Corn, and increaſe it.</hi> But now tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Proſperity without this Bleſſing will prove that of fools which deſtroys them. It God give a People fulneſs of Bread and take His Spirit from them, they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare

their Sin like <hi>Sodom,</hi> abuſing God's good Creatures to His diſhonour, and their own deſtruction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.15.78, 29, 31. Thus God threatned them, Mal. 2.2. <hi>I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">V. WE come now to prove the Doctrine; <hi>That our Heavenly Father will give His Holy Spirit to them that Ask Him.</hi> Now this is evident in that <hi>Chriſt the faithful Witneſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
