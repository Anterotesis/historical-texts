            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>THE ITALIAN, OR, THE Confeſſional of the Black Penitents.</head>
                  <p>ABOUT the year 1764, ſome Engliſh travellers in Italy, during one of their excurſions in the envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of Naples, happened to ſtop before the portico of the <hi>Santa Maria del Pianto,</hi> a church belonging to a very ancient convent of the order of the <hi>Black Penitents.</hi> The magnificence of this portico, though impaired by time, excited ſo much admiration, that the travellers were curious to ſurvey the ſtructure to which it belonged, and with this intention they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the marble ſteps that led to it.</p>
                  <p>Within the ſhade of the portico, a perſon with fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded arms, and eyes directed towards the ground, was pacing behind the pillars the whole extent of the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and was apparently ſo engaged by his own thoughts, as not to obſerve that ſtrangers were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching. He turned, however, ſuddenly, as if ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled by the ſound of ſteps, and then, without further pauſing, glided to a door that opened into the church, and diſappeared.</p>
                  <p>There was ſomething too extraordinary in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of this man, and too ſingular in his conduct, to to paſs unnoticed by the viſitors. He was of a tall thin figure, bending forward from the ſhoulders; of a ſallow complexion, and harſh features, and had an
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:032735_0003_0FF4935616DDA728"/>
eye, which, as it looked up from the cloak that Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled the lower part of his countenance, ſeemed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of uncommon ferocity.</p>
                  <p>The travellers on entering the church, looked round for the ſtranger, who had paſſed thither before them, but he was no where to be ſeen, and, through all the ſhade of the long aiſles, only one other perſon appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This was a friar of the adjoining convent, who ſometimes pointed out to ſtrangers the objects in the church, which were moſt worthy of attention, and who now, with this deſign, approached the party that had juſt entered.</p>
                  <p>The interior of this edifice had nothing of the ſhewy ornament and general ſplendor, which diſtinguiſh the churches of Italy, and particularly thoſe of Naples; but it exhibited a ſimplicity and grandeur of deſign, conſiderably more intereſting to perſons of taſte, and a ſolemnity of light and ſhade much more ſuitable to promote the ſublime elevation of devotion.</p>
                  <p>When the party had viewed the different ſhrines and whatever had been judged worthy of obſervation, and were returning through an obſcure aiſle towards the portico, they perceived the perſon who had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared upon the ſteps, paſſing towards a confeſſional on the left, and, as he entered it, one of the party pointed him out to the friar, and enquired who he was; the friar turning to look after him, did not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately reply, but on the queſtion being repeated, he inclined his head, as in a kind of obeiſance, and calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly replied, "he is an aſſaſſin."</p>
                  <p>"An aſſaſſin!" exclaimed one of the Engliſhmen; "an aſſaſſin, and at liberty!"</p>
                  <p>An Italian gentleman, who was of the party, ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the aſtoniſhment of his friend.</p>
                  <p>"He has ſought ſanctuary here," replied the fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar; "within thoſe walls he may not be hurt."</p>
                  <p>"Do your altars, then, protect the murderer?" ſaid the Engliſhman.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="v" facs="unknown:032735_0004_0FF46DE6DB833680"/>
"He could find ſhelter no where elſe," anſwered the friar meekly.</p>
                  <p>"This is aſtoniſhing!" ſaid the Engliſhman, "of what avail are your laws, if the moſt atrocious cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal may thus find ſhelter from them? But how does he contrive to exiſt here! He is, at leaſt, in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being ſtarved?"</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me," replied the friar; "there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways people willing to aſſiſt thoſe, who cannot aſſiſt themſelves; and as the criminal may not leave the church in ſearch of food, they bring it to him here."</p>
                  <p>"Is this poſſible?" ſaid the Engliſhman, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Italian friend.</p>
                  <p>"Why, the poor wretch muſt not ſtarve," repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the friend; "which he inevitably would do, if food were not brought to him! But have you never ſince your arrival in Italy, happened to ſee a perſon in the ſituation of this man? It is by no means an uncommon one.',</p>
                  <p>"Never!" anſwered the Engliſhman, "and I can ſcarcely credit what I ſee now!"</p>
                  <p>"Why, my friend," obſerved the Italian, "if we were to ſhew no mercy to ſuch unfortunate perſons, aſſaſſinations are ſo frequent, that our cities would be half depopulated."</p>
                  <p>In notice of this profound remark, the Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man could only gravely bow.</p>
                  <p>'But obſerve yonder confeſſional,' added the Italian, "that beyond the pillars on the left of the aiſle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a painted window. Have you diſcovered it? The colours of the glaſs throw, inſtead of light, a ſhade over that part of the church, which, perhaps, prevents your diſtinguiſhing what I mean!"</p>
                  <p>The Engliſhman looked whither his friend point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and obſerved a confeſſional of oak, or ſome very dark wood adjoining the wall, and remarked alſo, that it was the ſame, which the aſſaſſin had juſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:032735_0005_0FF493579E4ED1D0"/>
It conſiſted of three compartments, covered with a black canopy. In the central diviſion was the chair of the confeſſor, elevated by ſeveral ſteps above the pavement of the church; and on either hand was a ſmall cloſet, or box, with ſteps leading up to a grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed partition, at which the penitent might kneel, and, concealed from obſervation, pour into the ear of the confeſſor, the conſciouſneſs of crimes that lay heavy on his heart.</p>
                  <p>"You obſerve it?" ſaid the Italian.</p>
                  <p>"I do," replied the Engliſhman; "it is the ſame which the aſſaſſin has paſſed into; and I think it one of the moſt gloomy ſpots I ever beheld; the view of it is enough to ſtrike a criminal with deſpair!"</p>
                  <p>"We, in Italy, are not ſo apt to deſpair," replied the Italian ſmilingly.</p>
                  <p>"Well, but what of this confeſſional?" enquired the Engliſhman. "The aſſaſſin entered it!"</p>
                  <p>"He has no relation, with what I am about to mention," replied the Italian; "but I wiſh you to mark the place, becauſe ſome very extraordinary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances belong to it."</p>
                  <p>"What are they?" replied the Engliſhman.</p>
                  <p>"It is now ſeveral years ſince the confeſſion, which is connected with them, was made at that very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſional," added the Italian; "the view of it, and the ſight of this aſſaſſin, with your ſurprize at the liberty which is allowed him, led me to a recollection of the ſtory. When you return to the hotel, I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it to you, if you have no pleaſanter way of engaging your time.</p>
                  <p>"I have a curioſity to hear it," replied the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman, "cannot you relate it now?,'</p>
                  <p>"It is much too long to be related now; that would occupy a week; I have it in writing, and will ſend you the volume. A young ſtudent of of Padua, who happened to be at Naples ſoon after this horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confeſſion became public"—</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:032735_0006_0FF46DEA18D97728"/>
"Pardon me," interrupted the Engliſhman, "that is ſurely very extraordinary? I thought confeſſions were always held ſacred by the prieſt, to whom they were made."</p>
                  <p>"Your obſervation is reaſonable," rejoined the Italian; "the faith of the prieſt is never broken, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by an eſpecial command from an higher power; and the circumſtances muſt even then be very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary to juſtify ſuch a departure from the law. But, when you read the narrative, your ſurpriſe on this head will ceaſe. I was going to tell you that it was written by a ſtudent at Padua, who, happening to be here ſoon after the affair became public, was ſo muck ſtruck with the facts, that, partly, as an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and partly, in return for ſome trifling ſervices I had rendered him, he committed them to paper for me. You will perceive from the work, that this ſtudent was very young, as to the arts of compoſition, but the facts are what you require, and from theſe he has not deviated. But come let us leave the church."</p>
                  <p>"After I had taken another view of this ſolemn edifice," replied the Engliſhman, "and particularly of the confeſſional you have pointed to my notice!"</p>
                  <p>While the Engliſhman glanced his eye over the high roofs, and along the ſolemn perſpectives of the Santa del Pianto, he perceived the figure of the aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin ſtealing from the confeſional acroſs the choir, and, ſhocked on again, beholding him, he turned his eyes, and haſtily quitted the church.</p>
                  <p>The friends then ſeparated and the Engliſhman, ſoon after returning to his hotel, received the volume. He read as follows:</p>

                     <p>IT was in the church of San Lorenzo at Naples, in the year 1758; that Vicentio di Vivaldi firſt ſaw Ellena Roſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ba. The ſweetneſs and fine expreſſion of her voice attracted his attention to her figure, which had a diſtinguiſhed air of delicacy and grace; but her face was concealed in her veil. So much indeed was he facinated by the voice, that a moſt painful curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity was excited as to her countenance, which he fancied muſt expreſs all the ſenſibility of character that the modulation of her tones indicated. He liſtened to their exquiſite expreſſion with a rapt attention, and hardly withdrew his eyes from her perſon till the matin ſervice had concluded; when he obſerved her leave the church, with an aged lady, who leaned upon her arm, and who appeared to be her mother.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi immediately followed their ſteps, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to obtain, if poſſible, a view of Ellena's face, and and to diſcover the home to which ſhe ſhould retire. They walked quickly, looking niether to the right or left, and as they turned into the Strada di Toledo he had nearly loſt them; but quickening his pace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhing the cautious diſtance he had hitherto kept-he overtook them as they entered on the Terrazzo Nuovo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which runs along the bay of Naples, and leads
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032735_0008_0FF4935925959500"/>
towards the Gran Corſo. He overtook them; but the fair unknown ſtill held her veil cloſe, and he knew not how to introduce himſelf to her notice or to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a view of the features, which excited his curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He was embarraſſed by a reſpectful timidity, that mingled with his admiration, and which kept him ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, notwithſtanding his wiſh to ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>In deſcending the laſt ſteps of the <hi>Terrazzo,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the foot of the elder lady faultered, and, while Vivaldi, haſtened to aſſiſt her, the breeze from the water caught the veil, which Ellena had no longer a hand ſufficiently diſengaged to confine, and, wafting it partially aſide, diſcloſed to him a countenance more touchingly beautiful than he had dared to imagine. Her features were of the Grecian outline, and, though they expreſſed the tranquility of an elegant mind, her dark blue eyes ſparkled with intelligence. She was aſſiſting her companion ſo anxiouſly, that ſhe did not imediately obſerve the admiration ſhe had inſpired; but the moment her eyes met thoſe of Vivaldi, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came conſcious of their effect, and ſhe haſtily drew her veil,</p>
                     <p>The old lady was not materially hurt by her fall, as ſhe walked with dificulty, Vivaldi ſiezed the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity thus offered, and inſiſted that ſhe ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his arm. She refuſed this with many acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements; but he preſſed ſo repeatedly and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, that; at length, ſhe accepted it, and they walked towards her reſidence together.</p>
                     <p>On the way thither, he attempted to converſe with Ellena, but her replies were conciſe and he arrived at the end of the walk while he was yet conſidering what he could ſay, that might intereſt and withdraw her from this ſevere reſerve. From the ſtyle of their reſidence, he imagined they were perſons of honorable but moderate independence. The houſe was ſmall, but exhibited an air of comfort, and even of taſte. It
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032735_0009_0FF46DEF0CF69E68"/>
ſtood on an eminence, ſurrounded by a garden and vineyards, which commanded the city and bay of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, an ever-moving picture, and was canopied by a thick grove of pines and majeſtic date-trees; and though the little portico and colonade in front were of common marble, the ſtyle of architect was elegant. While they afforded a ſhelter from the ſun, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the cooling breezes that roſe from the bay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and a proſpect of the whole ſcope of its enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhores.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi ſtopped at the little gate, which led into the garden, where the elder lady repeated her acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement for his care, but did not invite him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and he, trembling with anxiety and ſinking with diſappointment, remained for a moment gazing upon Ellena, unable to take leave, yet irreſolute what to ſay that might prolong the interview, till the old lady again bade him good-day. He then ſummoned cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage enough to requeſt he might be allowed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after her health, and, having obtained her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, his eyes bade adieu to Ellena, who, as they were parting, ventured to thank him for the care he had taken of her aunt. The ſound of her voice, and his acknowledgment of obligation, made him leſs willing to go than before, but at length he tore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf away. The beauty of her countenance haunting his imagination, and the touching accents of her voice ſtill vibrating on his heart, he deſcended to the ſhore below her reſidence, pleaſing himſelf with the conſciouſneſs of being near her, though he could no longer behold her; and ſometimes hoping that he might again ſee her, however diſtantly, in a balcony of the houſe, where the ſilk awning ſeemed to invite the breeze from the ſea. He lingered hour after hour, ſtretched beneath the umbrageous pines that waved over the ſhore, or traverſing, regardleſs of the heat, the baſe of the cliffs that crowned it; recalling to his
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032735_0010_0FF4935AAC278720"/>
fancy the enchantment of her ſmile, and ſeeming ſtill to liſten to the ſweetneſs of her accents,</p>
                     <p>In the evening he returned to his father's palace at Naples, thoughtful yet pleaſed, anxious yet happy; dwelling with delightful hope on the remembrance of the thanks he had received from Ellena, yet not daring to form any plan as to his future conduct. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned time enough to attend his mother in her even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ride on the Corſo, where, in every gay carriage that paſſed he hoped to ſee the object of his conſtant thought; but ſhe did not appear. His mother, the Marcheſa di Vivaldi, obſerved his anxiety and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual ſilence, and aſked him ſome queſtions, which ſhe meant ſhould lead to an explanation of the change in his manners; but his replies only excited a ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er curioſity, and though ſhe forbore to preſs her enquiries, it was probable that ſhe might employ a more artful means of renewing them.</p>
                     <p>Vincentio di Vivaldi was the only ſon of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſe di Vivaldi, a nobleman of one of the moſt ancient families of the kingdom of Naples, a favourite poſſeſſing an uncommon ſhare of influence at Court, and a man ſtill higher in power than in rank. His pride of birth was equal to either, but it was mingled with the juſtifiable pride of a principled mind; it governed his conduct in morals as well as in the jealouſy of ceremonial diſtinctions, and elevated his practice as well as his claims. His pride was at once his vice and his virtue, his ſafeguard and his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>The mother of Vivaldi, deſcended from a family as ancient as that of his father, was equally jealous of her importance; but her pride was that of birth and diſtinction, without extending to morals. She was of violent paſſions, haughty, vindictive, yet crafty and deceitful; patient in ſtratagem, and indefatigable in purſuit of vengeance, on the unhappy objects who
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032735_0011_0FF46DF0C8549D38"/>
provoked her reſentment. She loved her ſon, rather as being the laſt of two illuſtrious houſes, who was to re-unite and ſupport the honor of both, than with the fondneſs of a mother.</p>
                     <p>Vicentio inherited much of the character of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and very little of that of his mother. His pride was as noble and as generous as that of the Marcheſe; but he had ſomewhat of the fiery paſſions of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa, without any of her craft, her duplicity, or vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive thirſt of revenge. Frank in his temper, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous in his ſentiments. quickly offended, but ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily appeaſed; irritated by any appearance of diſreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, but melted by a conceſſion, a high ſenſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor rendered him no more jealous of offence, than a delicate humanity made him ready for reconciliation, and anxious to ſpare the feelings of others.</p>
                     <p>On the day following that, on which he had ſeen Ellena, he returned to the villa Altieri, to uſe the permiſſion granted him on enquiring after the health of Signora Bianchi. The expectation of ſeeing El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena agitated him with impatient joy and trembling hope, which ſtill, encreaſed as he approached her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, till, having reached the garden-gate, he was obliged to reſt for a few moments to recover breath and compoſure.</p>
                     <p>Having announced himſelf to an old female ſervant, who came to the gate, he was ſoon after admitted to a ſmall veſtibule, where he found Signora Bianchi wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing balls of ſilk, and alone; though from the poſition of a chair which ſtood near a frame for embroidery, he judged that Ellena had juſt quitted the apartment.</p>
                     <p>Signora Bianchi received him with a reſerved po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs, and ſeemed very cautious in her replies to his enquiries after her niece, who, he hoped, every moment, would appear. He lengthened his viſit till there was no longer an excuſe for doing ſo; till he
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032735_0012_0FF493646C0D11B0"/>
had exhauſted every topic of converſation, and till the ſilence of Signora Bianchi ſeemed to hint, that his departure was expected. With a heart ſaddened by diſappointment, and having obtained only a reluctant permiſſion to enquire after the health of that lady on ſome future day, he took his leave.</p>
                     <p>On his way through the garden he often pauſed to look back on the houſe, hoping to obtain a glimpſe of Ellena at a lattice; and threw a glance around him, almoſt expecting to ſee her ſeated beneath the ſhade of the luxuriant plaintains; but his ſearch was every where vain, and he quitted the place with the ſlow and heavy ſtep of deſpondency.</p>
                     <p>The day was employed in endeavours to obtain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence concerning the family of Ellena, but of this he procured little that was ſatisfactory. He was told, that ſhe was an orphan, living under the care of her aunt, Signora Bianchi: that her family, which had never been illuſtrious, was decayed in fortune, and that her only dependance was upon this aunt. But he was ignorant of what was very true, though very ſecret, that ſhe aſſiſted to ſupport this aged relative, whoſe ſole property was the ſmall eſtate on which they lived, and that ſhe paſſed whole days in embroid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering ſilks, which were diſpoſed of to the nuns of a neighbouring convent, who ſold them to the Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan ladies, that viſited their grate, at a very high ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. He little thought, that a beautiful robe, which he had often ſeen his mother wear, was worked by Ellena; nor that ſome copies from the antique, which ornamented a cabinet of the Vivaldi palace, were drawn by her hand. If he had known theſe circumſtances, they would only have ſerved to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the paſſion, which, ſince they were proofs of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>parity of fortune, that would certainly render his family repugnant to a connection with hers, it would have been prudent to diſcourage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="15" facs="unknown:032735_0013_0FF46DF5B72E7ED0"/>
Ellena could have endured poverty, but not contempt; and it was to protect herſelf from this effect of the narrow prejudices of the world around her, that ſhe had ſo cautiouſly concealed from it a knowledge of the induſtry, which did honor to her character. She was not aſhamed of poverty or the induſtry which overcame it, but her ſpirit ſhrunk from the ſenſeleſs ſmile and humiliating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, which proſperity ſometimes gives to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence. Her mind was not yet ſtrong enough, or her views ſufficiently enlarged, to teach her a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the ſneer of vicious folly, and to glory in the dignity of virtuous independence, Ellena was the ſole ſupport of her aunt's declining years; was patient of her infirmities, and conſoling to her ſufferings; and repaid the fondneſs of a mother with the affection of a daughter. Her mother ſhe had never known, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt her while ſhe was an infant, and from that period Signora Bianchi had performed the duties of one for her.</p>
                     <p>Thus innocent and happy in the ſilent performance of her duties and in the veil of retirement, lived Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Roſalba, when ſhe firſt ſaw Vincentio di Vivaldi. He was not a figure to paſs unobſerved when ſeen, and Ellena had been ſtruck by the ſpirit and dignity of his air, and by his countenance, ſo frank, noble, and full of that kind of expreſſion, which announces the energies of the ſoul. But ſhe was cautious of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a ſentiment more tender than admiration, and endeavour to diſmiſs his image from her mind, and by engaging in her uſual occupations, to recover the ſtate of tranquility, which his appearance had ſomewhat interrupted.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, mean while, reſtleſs from diſappointment, and impatient from anxiety, having paſſed the greater part of the day in enquiries, which repaid him only with doubt and apprehenſion, determined to return to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032735_0014_0FF49365F4D31A10"/>
the villa Altieri, when evening ſhould conceal his ſteps, conſoled by the certainty of being near the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his thoughts, and hoping, that chance might favour him once more with a view, however, tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of Ellena.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa Vivaldi held an aſſembly this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a ſuſpicion concerning the impatience he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, induced her to detain him about her perſon to a late hour, engaging him to ſelect the muſic for her orcheſtra, and to ſuperintend the performance of a new piece, the work of a compoſer whom ſhe had brought into faſhion. Her aſſemblies were among the moſt brilliant and crowded in Naples, and the nobility, who were to be at the palace this evening, were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two parties as to the merits of the muſical genius, whom ſhe patronized, and thoſe of another candidate for fame. The performance of the evening it was expected it would finally decide the victory. This therefore, was a night of great importance and anxiety to the Marcheſa, for ſhe was as jealous of the reputation of her favovrite compoſer as of her own, and the welfare of her ſon did but ſlightly divide her cares.</p>
                     <p>The moment he could depart unobſerved, he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the aſſembly, and, muffling himſelf in his cloak, haſtened to the villa Altiera, which lay at a ſhort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the weſt of the city. He reached it unobſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and breathleſs with impatience, traverſed the the boundary of the garden; where, free from cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial reſtraint and near the object of his affection, he experienced for the firſt few moments a joy as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite as her preſence could have inſpired. But this delight faded with its novelty, and in a ſhort time he felt as forlorn as if he was ſeparated for ever from El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena, in whoſe preſence he but lately almoſt beleived himſelf.</p>
                     <p>The night was far advanced, and, no light appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the houſe, he concluded the inhabitants had
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032735_0015_0FF46DF824451090"/>
retired to reſt, and all hope of ſeeing her vaniſhed from his mind. Still, however, it was ſweet to be near her, and he anxiouſly ſought to gain admittance to the gardens, that he might approach the window where it was poſſible ſhe repoſed. The boundary, formed of trees and thick ſhrubs, was not difficult to be paſſed, and he found himſelf once more in the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico of the villa.</p>
                     <p>It was nearly midnight, and the ſtillneſs that reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was rather ſoothed than interrupted by the gentle daſhings of the waters of the bay below, and by the hollow murmurs of Veſuvius, which threw up at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals its ſudden flame on the horizon, and then left it to darkneſs. The ſolemnity of the ſcene accorded with the temper of his mind, and he liſtened in deep attention for the returning ſounds, which broke upon the ear like diſtant thunder muttering imperfectly from the clouds. The pauſes of ſilence, that ſucceeded each groan of the mountain, when expectation liſtened for the riſing ſound, affected the imagination of Vivaldi at this time with particular awe, and, rapt in thought, he continued to gaze upon the ſublime and ſhadowy outline of the ſhores, and on the ſea, juſt deſcerned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the twilight of a cloudleſs ſky. along its grey ſurface many veſſels were purſuing their ſilent courſe, guided over the deep waters only by the polar ſtar, which burned with ſteady luſter. The air was calm, and roſe from the bay with moſt balmy and refreſhing coolneſs; it ſcarcely ſtirred the heads of the broad pines that overſpread the villa: and bore no ſounds but of the waves and the groans of the far-off moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain—till a chaunting of deep voices <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>welled from a diſtance. The ſolemn character of the ſtrain engaged his attention; he perceived that it was a requiem, and he endeavoured to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover from what quarter it came. It advanced, though diſtantly, and then paſſed away on the air.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032735_0016_0FF4936781D5E4F8"/>
The circumſtance ſtruck him; he knew not it was uſual in ſome parts of Italy to chant this ſtrain over the bed of the dying; but here the mourners ſeemed to walk on the earth, or in the air. He was not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as to the ſtrain itſelf;—once before he had heard it, and attended with circumſtances which made it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that he ſhould forget it. As he now liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the choral voices ſoftening diſtance, a few pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic voices notes brought full upon his remembrance the divine melody he had heard Ellena utter in the church of San Lorenzo. Overcome by the recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſtarted away, and, wandering over the garden reached another ſide of the villa, where he ſoon heard the voice of Ellena herſelf, performing the midnight hymn to the virgin, and accompanied by a lute, which ſhe touched with moſt affecting and delicate expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He ſtood for a moment entranced, and ſcarcely daring to breathe, leſt he ſhould loſe any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The lattice had been thrown open to admit the cool air, and he had a full view of her and the apartment. She was rſiiug from a ſmall altar where ſhe had concluded the ſervice; the glow of devotion was ſtill upon her countenance as ſhe raiſed her eyes, and with rapt earneſtneſs fixed them on the heavens. She ſtill held the lute, but no longer awakened it, and ſeemed loſt to every ſurroun-object. Her fine hair was negligently bound up in a ſilk net, and ſome treſſes that had eſcaped it, played on her neck, and round her beautiful countenance, which now was not even partially concealed by a viel. The light drapery of her dreſs, her whole figure, air, and attitude, were ſuch as might have been copied for a Grecian nymph.</p>

Vivaldi was perplexed and agitated between the wiſh of ſeizing an opportunity, which might never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain occur, of pleading his love, and the fear of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, by intruding upon her retirement at ſo ſacred an hour; but, while he thus heſitated, he heard her ſigh, and then with a ſweetneſs peculiar to her accent, pronounce his name. During the trembling anxiety, with which he liſtened to what might follow this men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his name, he diſturbed the clematis that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the lattice, and ſhe turned her eyes towards the window; but Vivaldi was entirely concealed by the foliage. She, however, roſe to cloſe the lattice, as ſhe approached which, Vivaldi, unable any longer to command himſelf, appeared before her. She ſtood fixed for an inſtant, while her countenance changed to an aſhy paleneſs; and then, with trembling haſte cloſing the lattice, quitted the apartment. Vivaldi felt as if all his hopes had vaniſhed with her.</p>
                     <p>After lingering in the garden for ſome time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perceiving a light in any other part of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or hearing a ſound proceed from it, he took his melancholy way to Naples. He now began to aſk himſelf ſome queſtions, which he ought to have urged before, and to enpuire wherefore he ſought the dangerous pleaſure of ſeeing Ellena, ſince her family was of ſuch a condition as rendered the conſent of his parents to a marriage with her unattainable.</p>
                     <p>He was loſt in revere on this ſubject, ſometimes half reſolved to ſeek her no more, and then ſhrinking from a conduct, which ſeemed to ſtrike him with the force of deſpair, when, as he emerged from the dark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> arch of ruin that extended over the road, his was way croſſed by a perſon in the habit of a monk, whoſe face was ſhrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his cowl ſtill more than by the twilight. The Stranger, addreſſing him by his name, ſaid, "Signor! your ſteps are watched; beware how you reviſit Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri!" Having uttered this, he diſappeared, before
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032735_0018_0FF493690987C608"/>
Vivaldi could return the ſword he had half drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſcabbard, or demand an explanation of the words he had heard. He called loudly and repeatedly conjuring the unknown perſon to appear; and linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near the ſpot for a conſiderable time; but the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on came no more.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi arrived at home with a mind occupied by this incident, and tormented by the jealouſy to which it gave riſe; for, after indulging various conjectures, he concluded with believing the notice, of which he had been warned, tobe that of a rival, and that the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which menaced him, was from the poniard of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy. This belief diſcovered to him at once the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his paſſion, and of the imprudence, which had thus readily admitted it; yet ſo far was this new pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from overcoming his error, that, ſtung with a torture more exquiſite than he had ever known, he reſolved, at every event, to declare his love, and ſue for the hand of Ellena. Unhappy young man, he knew not the fatal error, into which his paſſion was precipitating him.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032735_0019_0FF46DFBC0A29900"/>
ſuit of rooms, alternately tortured by the remembrance of Ellena, fired with jealouſy, and alarmed for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the imprudent ſtep, which he was about to take. He knew the temper of his father, and ſome of the traits of the character of his mother, ſufficently to fear that their diſpleaſure would be irreconcileable concerning the marriage he meditated; yet, when he conſidered that he was their only ſon, he was inclined to admit a hope of forgiveneſs, notwithſtanding the weight which the circumſtance muſt add to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment. Theſe reflections were frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by ſears leſt Ellena had already diſpoſed of her affections to this imaginary rival. He was how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſomewhat conſoled by remembring the ſigh ſhe had uttered, and the tenderneſs, with which ſhe had immediately pronounced his name. Yet, even, if ſhe were not averſe to his ſuit, how could he ſolicit her hand, and hope it would be given him, when he ſhould declare that this muſt be in ſecret? He ſcarcely da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to beleived that ſhe would condeſcend to enter a family who diſdained to receive her? and again deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency overcame him.</p>
                     <p>The morning found him as diſtracted as the night had left him; his determination, however, was fixed; and this was to ſacrifice what he now conſidered as a deluſive pride of birth, to a choice which he beleived would enſure the happineſs of his life. But, before he ventured to declare himſelf to Ellena, it appeared ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to aſcertain whether he held an intereſt in her heart, or whether ſhe had devoted it to the rival of his love, and who this rival really was. It was ſo much eaſier to wiſh for ſuch information than to obtain it, that, after forming a thouſand projects, either the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy of his reſpect for Ellena, or his fear of offending her, or an apprehenſion of diſcovery from his family before he had ſecured an intereſt in her affections, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly oppoſed his views of an enquiry.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="unknown:032735_0020_0FF493729878CD10"/>
In this difficulty he opened his heart to a friend, who had long poſſeſſed his confidence, and whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he ſolicited with ſomewhat more anxiety and ſincerity than is uſual on ſuch occaſions. It was not a ſanction of his own oppinion that he required, but the impartial judgment of another mind. Bonarmo, however little he might be qualified for the office of an adviſer, did not ſcruple to give his advice. As a means of judging whether Ellena was diſpoſed to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour Vivaldi's addreſſes, he propoſed, that, according to the cuſtom of the country, a ſerenade ſhould be given; he maintained, that, if ſhe was not diſinclined towards him, ſome ſign of approbation would appear; and if otherwiſe, that ſhe would remain ſilent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible. Vivaldi objected to this coarſe and inadequate mode of expreſſing a love ſo ſacred as his, and he had too lofty an opinion of Ellena's mind and delicacy, to believe, that the trifling homage of a ſerenade would either flatter her ſelf-love, or intereſt her in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; nor, if it did, could he venture to believ, that ſhe would diſplay any ſign of approbation.</p>
                     <p>His friend laughed at his ſcruples and at his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what he called ſuch romantic delicacy, that his ignorance of the world was his only excuſe for having cheriſhed them. But Vivaldi interrupted this raillery, and would neither ſuffer him to ſpeak thus of Ellena, or to call ſuch delicacy romantic. Bonarmo, however ſtill urged the ſerenade as at leaſt a poſſible means of diſcovering her diſpoſition towards him before he made a formal avowel of his ſuit; and Vivaldi, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and diſtracted with apprehenſion and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to terminate his preſent ſtate of ſuſpence, was at length ſo far overcome by his own difficulties, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then by his friend's perſuaſion, that he conſented to make the adventure of a ſerenade on the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing night. This was adopted rather as a refuge from deſponedncy, than with any hope of ſucceſs; for he
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032735_0021_0FF46DFE33595ED8"/>
ſtill believed that Ellena would not give any hint, that might terminate his uncertainty.</p>
                     <p>Beneath their cloaks they carried muſical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and, muffling their faces, ſo that they could not be known, they proceeded in thoughtful ſilence on the way to the villa Altieri. Already they had paſſed the arch, in which Vivaldi was ſtopped by the ſtranger on the proceeding night, when he heard a ſudden ſound near him, and, raiſing his head from the cloak, he perceived the ſame figure! Before he had time for exclamation, the ſtranger croſſed him again. "Go not to the villa Altieri," ſaid he in a ſolemn voice, "leſt you meet the fate you ought to dread."</p>
                     <p>"What fate?" demanded Vivaldi, ſtepping back; "Speak, I conjure you!"</p>
                     <p>But the monk was gone, and the darkneſs of the hour baffled obſervation as to the way of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                     <p>"It is almoſt beyond endurance," exclaimed Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi; "which way did he paſs?"</p>
                     <p>"He glided by me," replied Bonarmo, "and he was gone before I could croſs him?"</p>
                     <p>"I will tempt the worſt at once," ſaid Vivaldi; "if I have a rival, it is beſt to meet him. Let us go on."</p>
                     <p>Bonarmo remonſtrated, and repreſented the ſerious danger that threatened from ſo raſh a proceeding. "It is evident that you have a rival," ſaid he; "and your courage cannot avail you againſt hired bravos." Vivaldi's heart ſwelled at the mention of a rival. "If you think it dangerous to proceed, I will go alone," ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>Hurt by this reproof, Bonarmo accompanied his friend in ſilence, and they reached without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032735_0022_0FF493744269F738"/>
the boundary of the villa. Vivaldi led to the place <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> which he had entered on the preceding night, and they paſſed unmoleſted into the garden.</p>
                     <p>"Where are theſe terrible bravos of whom you warned me?" ſaid Vivaldi, with taunting exultation.</p>
                     <p>"Speak cautiouſly," replied his friend; "we may even now, be within their reach?"</p>
                     <p>"They alſo may be within ours," obſerved Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi.</p>
                     <p>At length theſe adventurous friends came to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangery, which was near the houſe, when, tired by the aſcent, they reſted to recover breath and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their inſtruments for the ſerenade. The night was ſtill, and they now heard, for the firſt time, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs as of a diſtant multitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then the ſudden ſplendour of fire works broke upon the ſky. Theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe from a villa on the weſtern margin of the bay, and were given in honour of the birth of one of the royal princes. They ſoared to an immence height, and, as their luſtre broke ſilently upon the night, it lightened on the thouſand upturned faces of the gazing crowd, illumined the waters of the bay, with every little boat that ſkimmed its ſurface, and ſhewed diſtinctly the whole ſweep of its riſing ſhores, the ſtately city of Naples on the ſtrand below, and ſpreading far among the hills, its terraced roofs crowded with ſpectators and the Corſo tumultuous with carriages and blazing with torches.</p>
                     <p>While Bonarmo ſurveyed this magnificent ſcene, Vivaldi turned his eyes to the reſidence of Ellena, part of which looked out from among the trees, with a hope that the ſpectacle would draw her to a balcony; but ſhe did not appear, nor was there any light that might indicate her approach,</p>
                     <p>While they ſtill reſted on the turf of the orangery, they herad a ruſtling of the leaves, as if the branches were diſturbed by ſome perſon who endeavoured to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032735_0023_0FF46E025E63B578"/>
make his way between them when, Vivaldi demanded who paſſed. No anſwer was returned, and a long ſilence followed.</p>
                     <p>"We are obſerved," ſaid Bonarmo, at length, "and are even now, perhaps, almoſt beneath the poniard of the aſſaſſin: let us be gone.</p>
                     <p>"O that my heart were as ſecure from the darts of love, the aſſaſſin of my peace," exclaimed Vivaldi, "as yours is from thoſe of bravos! My friend, you have little to intereſt you, ſince your thoughts have ſo much leiſure for apprehenſion."</p>
                     <p>"My fear is that of prudence, not of weakneſs," retorted Bonarmo, with acrimony; "you will find, perhaps, that I have none, when you moſt wiſh me to poſſeſs it."</p>
                     <p>"I underſtand you," replied Vivaldi "let us finiſh this buſineſs, and you ſhall receive reparation, ſince you beleive yourſelf injured: I am as anxious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair an offence, as jealous of receiving one."</p>
                     <p>"Yes," replied Bonarmo, "you would repair the injury you have done your friend with his blood.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! never, never!" ſaid Vivaldi, falling on his neck. "Forgive my haſty violence; allow for the diſtraction of my mind."</p>
                     <p>Bonarmo returned the imbrace, "It is enough," ſaid he; "no more, no more! I hold again my friend to my heart."</p>
                     <p>While this converſation paſſed, they had quitted the orangery, and reached the walls of the villa, where they took their ſtation under a balcony that overhung the lattice, through which Vivaldi had ſeen Ellena on the preceding night. They tuned their inſtruments, and opened the ſerenade with a duet.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi's voice was a fine tenor, and the ſame ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibility, which made him paſſionately fond of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, taught him to modulate its cadence with exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite delicacy, and to give his emphaſis with the moſt
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032735_0024_0FF49375C87FA0F0"/>
ſimple and pathetic expreſſion, His ſoul ſeemed to breathe in the ſounds,—ſo tender, ſo imploring, yet ſo energetic. On this night, enthuſiaſm inſpired him with the higheſt eloquence, perhaps, which muſic is capable of attaining; what might be its effect on Ellena he had no means of judging, for ſhe did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear either at the balcony or the lattice, nor give any hint of applauſe. No ſounds ſtole on the ſtillneſs of the night, except thoſe of the ſerenade, nor did any light from within the villa break upon the obſcurity without; once, indeed, in a pauſe of the inſtruments Bonarmo fancied he diſtinguiſhed voices near him, as of perſons who feared to be heard, and he liſtened at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively, but without aſcertaining the truth. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they ſeemed to ſound heavily in his ear, and then a death-like ſilence prevailed. Vivaldi affirmed the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ound to be nothing more than the confuſed murmur of the diſtant multitude on the ſhore, but Bonarmo was not thus eaſily convinced.</p>
                     <p>The muſicians, unſucceſsful in their firſt endeavour to attract attention, removed to the oppoſite ſide of the building, and placed themſelves in front of the portico, but with as little ſucceſs; and, after having exerciſed their powers of harmony and of patience for above an hour, they reſigned all further effort to win upon the obdurate Ellena. Vivaldi, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the feebleneſs of his firſt hope of ſeeing her, now ſuffered an agony of diſappointment; and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narmo, alarmed for the conſequence of his deſpair, was as anxious to perſuade him that he had no rival, as he had lately been pertinacious in affirming that he had one.</p>
                     <p>At length they left the gardens, Vivaldi, proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he would not reſt until he had diſcovered the ſtranger, who ſo wantonly deſtroyed his peace, and had compelled him to explain his ambiguous warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and Bonarmo remonſtrating on the imprudence
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:032735_0025_0FF46E0423763770"/>
and difficulty of the ſearch, and repreſenting that ſuch conduct would probably be the means of ſpreading a report of his attachment, where moſt he dreaded it ſhould be known,</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi refuſed to yield to remonſtrance or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of any kind. "We ſhall ſee," ſaid he, "whether this demon in the garb of a monk, will haunt me again at the accuſtomed place; if he does, he ſhall not eſcape my graſp; and if he does not, I will watch as vigilantly for his return, as he ſeems to have done for mine. I will lurk in the ſhade of the ruin, and wait for him, though it be till death!"</p>
                     <p>Bonarmo was particularly ſtruck by the vehemence which he pronounced the laſt words, but he no longer oppoſed his purpoſe, and only bade him conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was well armed, "For" he added, "you may have need of arms there, though you had no uſe for them at the villa Altieri. Remember that the ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er told you that your ſteps were watched."</p>
                     <p>"I have my ſword," replied Vivaldi, "and the dagger which I uſually wear; but I ought to enquire what are your weapons of defence."</p>
                     <p>"Huſh!" ſaid Bornarmo, as they turned the foot of a rock that overhung the road, "we are approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpot; yonder is the arch!" It appeared duſki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the perſpective, ſuſpended between two cliffs, where the road wound from ſight, on one of which were the ruins of the Roman fort it belonged to, and on the other, ſhadowing pines, and thickets of oak that tufted the rock to its baſe.</p>
                     <p>They proceeded in ſilence, treading lightly, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten throwing a ſuſpicious glance around, expecting every inſtant that the monk would ſteal out upon them from ſome receſs of the cliffs. But they paſſed on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

beſides ourſelves may be ſhrouded in this obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. I like not the place."</p>
                     <p>"Who but ourſelves would chuſe ſo diſmal a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat?" whiſpered Vivaldi, "unleſs indeed, it were banditti; the ſavageneſs of the ſpot would, in truth, ſuit their humour, and it ſuits well alſo with my own."</p>
                     <p>"It would ſuit their purpoſe too, as well as their humour," obſerved Bonarmo. "Let us remove from this deep ſhade, into the more open road, where we can as cloſely obſerve who paſſes.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi objected that in the road they might them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be obſerved, "and if we are ſeen by my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tormentor, our deſign is defeated, for he comes upon us ſuddenly, or not at all, leſt we ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to detain him.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, as he ſaid this, took his ſtation within the thickeſt gloom of the arch, which was of conſiderable depth, and near a flight of ſteps that was cut in the rock, and aſcended to the fortreſs. His friend ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped cloſe to his ſide. After a pauſe of ſilence, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which Bonarmo was meditating, and Vivaldi was impatiently watching, "do you really believe," ſaid the former, "that any effort to detain him would be effectual? He glided paſt me with a ſtrange faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it was ſurely more than human!"</p>
                     <p>"What is it you mean?" enquired Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Why, I mean that I could be ſuperſtitious. This place, perhaps, infects my mind with congenial gloom, for I find that, at this moment, there is ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſuperſtition too dark for my credulity."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi ſmiled. "And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you muſt allow," added Bonarmo, "that he has appeared under circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſomewhat extraordinary. How ſhould he know your name, by which you ſay he addreſſed you at the firſt meeting? How ſhould he know from whence you came, or whether you deſigned to return? By what magic could he become acquainted with your plans?"</p>

"Nor am I certain that he is acquainted with them," obſerved Vivaldi; "but if he is, there was no neceſſity for ſuperhuman means to obtain ſuch knowledge."</p>
                     <p>"The reſult of this evening ſurely ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you that he is acquainted with your deſigns," ſaid Bonarmo. Do you believe it poſſible that Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na could have been inſenſible to your attentions, "if her heart had not been pre-engaged, and that ſhe would not have ſhewn herſelf at a lattice?"</p>
                     <p>"You do not know Ellena," replied Vivaldi, "and therefore I once more pardon you the queſtion. Yet had ſhe been diſpoſed to accept my addreſſes, ſurely ſome ſign of approbation,"—he checked himſelf.</p>
                     <p>"The ſtranger warned you not to go to the villa Altieri," reſumed Bonarmo, "he ſeemed to anticipate the reception which awaited you, and to know a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which hitherto you have happily eſcaped."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, he anticipated too well that reception," ſaid Vivaldi, loſing, his prudence in paſſionate exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; "and he is himſelf, perhaps, the rival, whom he has taught me to ſuſpect. He has aſſumed a diſguiſe only the more effectually to impoſe upon my credulity, and do deter me from addreſſing Ellena. And ſhall I tamely lie in wait for his approach? Shall I lurk like a guilty aſſaſſin for his rival?"</p>
                     <p>"For heaven's ſake!" ſaid Bonarmo, "moderate theſe tranſports; conſider where you are. This ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of yours is in the higheſt degree improbable." He gave his reaſons for thinking ſo, and theſe convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Vivaldi, who was prevailed upon to be once more patient.</p>
                     <p>They had remained watchful and ſtill for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time, when Bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032735_0028_0FF49380DF131018"/>
of this brilliant climate was, for a few paces, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Vivaldi's eyes were fixed on the road lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards Naples, and he, therefore, did not perceive the object of Bonarmo's attention, who, fearful of his friend's precipitancy, forbore to point out immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what he obſerved, judging it more prudent to watch the motions of this unknown perſon, that he might aſcertain whether it really were the monk. The ſize of the figure, and the dark drapery in which it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wrapt, induced him, at length, to believe that this was the expected ſtranger; and he ſeized Vivaldi's arm to direct his attention to him, when the form glided forward diſappeared in the gloom, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Vivaldi had underſtood the occaſion of his friend's geſture and ſignificant ſilence. They heard no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep paſs them, and, being convinced that this perſon, whatever he was, had not left the arch-way, they kept their ſtation in watchful ſtillneſs. Preſently they heard a ruſtling, as of garments, near them, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, unable longer to command his patience, ſtarted from his concealment, and with arms extended to prevent any one from eſcaping, demanded who was there.</p>
                     <p>The ſound ceaſed, and no reply was made. Bonarmo drew his ſword, proteſting he would ſtab the air till he found the perſon who lurked there; but if the latter would diſcover himſelf, he ſhould receive no injury. This aſſurance Vivaldi confirmed by his promiſe. Still no anſwer was returned; but as they liſtened for a voice, they thought ſomething paſſed them, and the avenue was not narrow enough to have prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a circumſtance. Vivaldi ruſhed forward, but did not perceive any perſon iſſue from the arch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the highway, where the ſtronger twilight muſt have diſcovered him.</p>
                     <p>"Somebody certainly paſſed," whiſpered Bonar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, "and I think I hear a ſound from yonder ſteps, that lead to the fortreſs."</p>

"Let us follow," cried Vivaldi, and he began to aſcend.</p>
                     <p>"Stop, for heaven's ſake ſtop!" ſaid Bonarmo; "conſider what you are about! Do not brave the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darkneſs of theſe ruins; do not purſue the aſſaſſin to his den!"</p>
                     <p>"It is the monk himſelf! exclaimed Vivaldi, ſtill aſcending; "he ſhall not eſcape me!"</p>
                     <p>Bonarmo pauſed a moment at the foot of the ſteps, and his friend diſappeared; he heſitated what to do, till aſhamed of ſuffering him to encounter danger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, he ſprang to the flight, and not without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſurmounted the rugged ſteps.</p>
                     <p>Having reached the ſummit of the rock, he found himſelf on a terrace, that ran along the top of the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and had once been fortified; this, croſſing the road, commanded the defile each way. Some remains of maſſy walls, that ſtill exhibited loops for archers, were all that now hinted of its former uſe. It led to a watch-tower almoſt concealed in thick pines, that crowned the oppoſite cliff, and had thus ſerved not only for a ſtrong battery over the road, but connecting the oppoſite ſides of the defile, had formed a line of communication between the fort and this out-poſt.</p>
                     <p>Bonarmo looked round in vain for his friend, and the echoes of his own voice only, among the rocks, replied to his repeated calls. After ſome heſitation whether to enter the walls of the main building, or to croſs to the watch-tower, he determined on the former, and entered a rugged area, the walls of which, following the declivities of the precipice, could ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now be traced. The citadel, a round tower, of majeſtic ſtrength, with ſome Roman arches ſcattered near, was all that remained of this once important fortreſs; except, indeed, a maſs of ruins near the edge of the cliff, the conſtruction of which made it difficult to gueſs for what purpoſe it had been deſigned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="unknown:032735_0030_0FF4938268280780"/>
Bonarmo entered the immenſe walls of the citadel, but the utter darkneſs within checked his progreſs, and, contenting himſelf with calling loudly on Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, he returned to the open air.</p>
                     <p>As he approached the maſs of ruins, whoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular form had intereſted his curioſity, he thought he diſtinguiſhed the low accents of a human voice, and while he liſtened in anxiety, a perſon ruſhed forth from a door-way of the ruin, carrying a drawn ſword. It was Vivaldi himſelf. Bonarmo ſprang to meet him; he was pale and breathleſs, and ſome moments elapſed before he could ſpeak, or appeared to hear the repeated enquiries of his friend.</p>
                     <p>"Let us go," ſaid Vivaldi, "let us leave this place."</p>
                     <p>"Moſt willingly," replied Bonarmo, "but where have you been, and who have you ſeen, that you are thus affected?"</p>
                     <p>"Aſk me no more queſtions, let us go,' repeated Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>They deſcended the rock together, and when having reached the arch way, Bonarmo enquired, half ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, whether they ſhould remain any longer on the watch, his friend anſwered, "No!" with an emphaſis that ſtartled him. They paſſed haſtily on the way to Naples, Bonarmo repeating enquiries which Vivaldi ſeemed reluctant to ſatisfy, and wondering no leſs at the cauſe of this ſudden reſerve, than anxious to know whom he had ſeen.</p>
                     <p>"It was the monk, then," ſaid Bonarmo; "you ſecured him at laſt?"</p>
                     <p>"I know not what to think," replied Vivaldi, "I am more perplexed than ever."</p>
                     <p>"He eſcaped you then?"</p>
                     <p>"We will ſpeak of this in future," ſaid Vivaldi; "but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e it as it may, the buſineſs reſts not here. I will return in the night of to-morrow with a torch; dare you venture yourſelf with me?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="unknown:032735_0031_0FF46E0C72BE0D20"/>
"I know not," replied Bonarmo, "whether I ought to do ſo, ſince I am not informed for what purpoſe?"</p>
                     <p>"I will not preſs you to go," ſaid Vivaldi; my purpoſe is already known to you."</p>
                     <p>"Have you really failed to diſcover the ſtranger—have you ſtill doubts concerning the perſon you pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued?"</p>
                     <p>I have doubts, which to-morow night, I hope will diſſipate."</p>
                     <p>"This is very ſtrange!" ſaid Bonarmo, "It was but now that I witneſſed the horror, with which you left this fortreſs of Puluzzi, and already you ſpeak of returning to it! And why at night—why not in the day, when leſs danger would beſet you?"</p>
                     <p>"I know not as to that," replied Vivaldi, "you are to obſerve that day-light never pierces within the receſs, to which I penetrated; we muſt ſearch the place with torches at whatſoever hour we would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine it."</p>
                     <p>"Since this is neceſſary," ſaid Bonarmo, "how happens it that you found your way in total darkneſs?"</p>
                     <p>"I was too much engaged to know how; I was led on, as by an inviſible hand."</p>
                     <p>"We muſt, notwithſtanding," obſerved Banarmo, "go in day-time, if not by day-light, provided I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company you. It would be little leſs than inſanity to go twice to a place, which is probably infeſted with robbers, and at their own hour of midnight."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall watch again in the accuſtomed place," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Vivaldi, "before I uſe my laſt reſource, and this cannot be done during the day. Beſides, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that I ſhould go at a particular hour, the hour when the monk has uſually appeared.</p>
                     <p>"He did eſcape you, then?" ſaid Bonarmo, "and you are ſtill ignorant concerning who he is?"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi rejoined only with an enquiry whether his friend would accompany him. "If not," he added<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "I muſt hope to find another companion."</p>
                     <p>

Bonarmo ſaid, that he muſt conſider of the propoſal, and would acquaint him with his determination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the following evening.</p>
                     <p>While this converſation concluded, they were in Naples, and at the gates of the Vivaldi palace, where they ſeparated for the remainder of the night.</p>

                     <p>SINCE Vivaldi had failed to procure an explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the words of the monk, he determined to relieve himſelf from the torture of ſuſpence, reſpecting a rival, by going to the villa Altieri, and declaring his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. On the morning immediately following his late adventure, he went thither, and on equiring for Signora Bianchi, was told ſhe could not be ſeen. With much difficulty he prevailed upon the old houſe keeper to deliver a requeſt that he might be permitted to wait upon her for a few moments. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was granted him, when he was conducted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very apartment where he had formerly ſeen Ellena. It was unoccupied, and he was told that Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora Bianchi would be there preſently.</p>
                     <p>During this interval, he was agitated at one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with quick impatience, and at another with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic pleaſure, while he gazed on the altar whence he had ſeen Ellena riſe, and where to his fancy, ſhe ſtill appeared; and on every object, on which he knew her eyes had lately dwelt. Theſe objects ſo familiar to her, had in the imagination of Vivaldi acquired ſomewhat of the ſacred character ſhe had impreſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his heart, and affected him in ſome degree as her preſence would have done. He trembled as he took
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032735_0034_0FF4938574769A60"/>
up the lute ſhe had been accuſtomed to touch, and, when he awakened the chords, her own voice ſeemed to ſpeak. A drawing half-finiſhed, of a dancing nymph, remained on a ſtand, and he immediately underſtood that her hand had traced the lines. It was a copy from Herculaneum, and though a copy, was touched with the ſpirit of original genius. The light ſteps ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared almoſt to move, and the whole figure diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the airy lightneſs of exquiſite grace. Vivaldi per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this to be one of a ſet that ornamented the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, and obſerved with ſurpriſe, that they were the particular ſubjects, which adorned his father's ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, and which he had underſtood to be the only co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies permitted from the originals in the royal mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeum.</p>
                     <p>Every object, on which his eyes reſted, ſeemed to announce the preſence of Ellena; and the very flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that ſo gaily embelliſhed the apartment, breathed forth a perfume, which faſcinated his ſenſes and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his imagination. Before Signora Bianchi appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his anxiety and apprehenſion had encreaſed ſo much that, believing he ſhould not be able to ſupport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in her preſence, he was more than once upon the point of leaving the houſe. At length, he heard her approaching ſtep from the hall; and his breath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt forſook him. The figure of Signora Bianchi was not of an order to inſpire admiration, and a ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator might have ſmiled to ſee the perterbation of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, his faultering ſtep and anxious eye, as he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to meet the venerable Bianchi, as he bowed upon her faded hand, and liſtened to her querulous voice. She received him with an air of reſerve, and ſome moments paſſed before he could recollect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſufficiently to explain the purpoſe of his viſit; yet this, when he diſcovered it, did not apparently ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize her. She liſtened with compoſure, though with ſomewhat of a ſevere countenance, to his proteſtations
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:032735_0035_0FF4933C1A9EF100"/>
of regard for her niece, and when he implored her to intercede for him in obtaining the hand of Ellena, ſhe ſaid, "I cannot be ignorant that a family of your rank muſt be averſe to an union with one of mine; nor am I unacquainted that a full ſenſe of the value of birth is a ſtriking feature in the characters of the Marcheſe and Marcheſa di Vivaldi. This propoſal muſt be diſagreeable or unknown to them; and I am to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, Signor, that, though Signora di Roſalba is their inferior in rank, ſhe is their equal in pride."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi diſdained to prevaricate, yet was ſhocked to own the truth thus abruptly. The ingenious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, however, with which he at length did this, and the energy of a paſſion too eloquent to be miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, ſomewhat ſoothed the anxiety of Signora Bian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi, with whom other conſiderations began to ariſe. She conſidered that from her own age and infirmities ſhe muſt very ſoon, in the courſe of nature, leave El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena a young and friendleſs orphan; ſtill ſomewhat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant upon her own induſtry, and entirely ſo on her diſcretion. With much beauty and little knowledge of the world, the dangers of her future ſituation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in vivid colours to the affectionate mind of Signora Bianchi; and ſhe ſometimes thought that it might be right to ſacrifice conſiderations, which in other circumſtances would be laudable, to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for her niece the protection of a huſband and a man of honour. If in this inſtance ſhe deſcended from the lofty integrity, which ought to have oppoſed her conſent that Ellena ſhould clandeſtinely enter any family, her parental anxiety may ſoften the cenſure ſhe deſerved.</p>
                     <p>But before ſhe determined upon this ſubject, it was neceſſary to aſcertain that Vivaldi was worthy the confidence ſhe might repoſe in him. To try, alſo, the conſtancy of his affection, ſhe gave little preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to his hopes. His requeſt to ſee Ellena
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:032735_0036_0FF4938FC4097280"/>
ſhe abſolutely refuſed, till ſhe ſhould have conſidered further of his propoſals; and his enquiry whether he had a rival, and, if he had, whether Ellena was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to favour him, ſhe evaded, ſince ſhe knew that a reply would give more encouragement to his hopes, than it might hereafter be proper to confirm.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, at length took his leave, releaſed, indeed, from abſolute deſpair, but ſcarcely encouraged to hope; ignorant that he had a rival, yet doubtful whether Ellena honoured himſelf with any ſhare of her eſteem.</p>
                     <p>He had received permiſſion to wait upon Signora Bianchi on a future day, but till that day ſhould ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive time appeared motionleſs; and, ſince it ſeemed utterly impoſſible to endure this interval of ſuſpence, his thoughts on the way to Naples were wholly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in contriving the means of concluding it, till he reached the well known arch, and looked round, though hopeleſsly, for his myſterious tormentor. The ſtranger did not appear; and Vivaldi purſued the road, determined to re-viſit the ſpot at night, and alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn privately to the villa Altieri, where he hoped a ſecond viſit might procure for him ſome relief from his preſent anxiety.</p>
                     <p>When he reached home he found that the Marcheſe, his father, had left an order for him, to await his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival; which he obeyed: but the day paſſed without his return. The Marcheſa, when ſhe ſaw him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired with a look that expreſſed much, how he had engaged himſelf of late, and completely fruſtrated his plans for the evening, by requiring him to attend her to Portici. Thus he was prevented from watching at Paluzzi, and from reviſiting Ellena's reſidence.</p>
                     <p>He remained at Portici the following evening, and, on his return to Naples, the Marcheſe being again abſent, he continued ignorant of the intended ſubject of the interview. A note from Bonarmo brought a refuſal to accompany him to the fortreſs, and urged
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:032735_0037_0FF4933DA4B268C0"/>
him to forbear ſo dangerous a viſit. Being for this night unprovided with a companion for the adventure, and unwilling to go alone, Vivaldi deferred it to another evening; but no conſideration could deter him from viſiting the villa Altieri. Not chuſing to ſolicit his friend to accompany him thither, ſince he had refuſed his firſt requeſt, he took his ſolitary lute, and reached the garden at an earlier hour than uſual.</p>
                     <p>The ſun had been ſet above an hour, but the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon ſtill retained ſomewhat of a ſaffron brilliancy, and the whole dome of the ſky had an appearance of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parency, peculiar to this enchanting climate, which ſeemed to diffuſe a more ſoothing twilight over the repoſing world. In the ſouth-caſt the outline of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuvius appeared diſtinctly, but the mountain itſelf was dark and ſilent.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi heard only the quick and eager voices of ſome Lazaroni at a diſtance on the ſhore, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at the ſimple game of maro. From the bowery lattices of a ſmall pavilion within the orangery, he perceived a light, and the ſudden hope which it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, of ſeeing Ellena, almoſt overcame him. It was impoſſible to reſiſt the opportunity of beholding her, yet he checked the impatient ſtep he was taking, to aſk himſelf, whether it was honourable thus to ſteal upon her retirement, and become an unſuſpected ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of her ſecret thoughts. But the temptation was too powerful for this honourable heſitation; the pauſe was momentary; and ſtepping lightly towards the pavilion, he placed himſelf near an open lattice, ſo as to be ſhrouded from obſervation by the branches of an orange-tree, while he obtained a full view of the apartment. Ellena was alone, ſitting in a thoughtful attitude and holding her lute, which ſhe did not play. She appeared loſt to a conſciouſneſs of ſurrounding objects, and a tenderneſs was on her countenance, which ſeemed to tell him that her thoughts were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:032735_0038_0FF493914B45C9B8"/>
by ſome intereſting ſubject. Recollecting that, when laſt he had ſeen her thus, ſhe pronounced his name, his hope revived, and he was going to diſcover himſelf and appear at her feet, when ſhe ſpoke, and he pauſed.</p>
                     <p>"Why this unreaſonable pride of birth!" ſaid ſhe, "A viſionary prejudice deſtroys our peace.—Never would I ſubmit to enter a family averſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me; they ſhall learn, at leaſt, that I inherit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſoul. O! Vivaldi! but for this unhappy prejudice!"—</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, while he liſtened to this, was immoveable; he ſeemed as if entranced; the ſound of her lute and voice recalled him, and he heard her ſing the firſt ſtanza of the very air, with which he had opened the ſerenade on a former night, and with ſuch ſweet pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thos as the compoſer muſt have felt when he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with the idea.</p>
                     <p>She pauſed at the concluſion of the firſt ſtanza, when Vivaldi, overcome by the temptation of ſuch an opportunity for expreſſing his paſſion, ſuddenly ſtruck the chords of the lute, and replied to her in the ſecond. The tremor of his voice, though it reſtrained his tones, heightened its eloquence. Ellena inſtantly recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; her colour alternately faded and returned; and, before the verſe concluded, ſhe ſeemed to have loſt all conſciouſneſs. Vivaldi was now advancing into the pavilion, when his approach recalled her; ſhe waved him to retire, and before he could ſpring to her ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, ſhe roſe and would have left the place, had he not interrupted her and implored a few moments at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
                     <p>"It is impoſſible," ſaid Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"Let me only hear you ſay that I am not hateful to you," rejoined Vivaldi; "that this intruſion has not deprived me of the regard, with which but now you acknowledged you honoured me."—</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="unknown:032735_0039_0FF4933F2CFE0930"/>
"Oh, never, never!" interrupted Ellena, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently; "forget that I ever made ſuch acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; forget that you ever heard it; I know not what I ſaid."</p>
                     <p>"Ah, beautiful Ellena! do you think it poſſible I ever can forget it? It will be the ſolace of my ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary hours, the hope that ſhall ſuſtain me."</p>
                     <p>"I cannot be detained, Signor," interrupted Ellena, ſtill more embarraſſed, "o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> forgive myſelf for having permitted ſuch converſation!" but as ſhe ſpoke the laſt words, an involuntary ſmile ſeemed to contradict their meaning. Vivaldi believed the ſmile in ſpite of the words; but, before he could expreſs the lightning joy of conviction, ſhe had left the pavilion; he followed through the garden—but ſhe was gone.</p>
                     <p>From this moment Vivaldi ſeemed to have ariſen into a new exiſtence; the whole world to him was Paradiſe; that ſmile ſeemed impreſſed upon his heart for ever. In the fulneſs of preſent joy, he believed it impoſſible that he ever could be unhappy again, and defied the utmoſt malice of future fortune. With footſteps light as air, he returned to Naples, nor once remembered to look for his old monitor on the way.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſe and his mother being from home, he was left at his leiſure to indulge the rapturous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, that preſſed upon his mind, and of which he was impatient of a moment's interruption. All night he either traverſed his apartment with an agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion equal to that, which anxiety had ſo lately inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or compoſed and deſtroyed letters to Ellena; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fearing that he had written too much, and at others feeling that he had written too little; recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtances which he ought to have mentioned, and lamenting the cold expreſſion of a paſſion, to which it appeared that no language could do juſtice.</p>

                        <pb n="42" facs="unknown:032735_0040_0FF49392D1B537E8"/>
By the hour when the domeſtics had riſen, he had, however, completed a letter ſomewhat more to his ſatisfaction, and he diſpatched it to the villa Altieri by a confidential perſon; but the ſervant had ſcarcely quitted the gates, when he recollected new arguments, which he wiſhed to urge, and expreſſions to change of the utmoſt importance to enforce his meaning, and he would have given half the world to have recalled the meſſenger.</p>
                     <p>In this ſtate of agitation he was ſummoned to attend the Marcheſe, who had been too much engaged of late to keep his own appointment. Vivaldi was not long in doubt as to the ſubject of this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view.</p>
                     <p>"I have wiſhed to ſpeak with you," ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſe, aſſuming an air of haughty ſeverity, "upon a ſubject of the utmoſt importance to your honour and happineſs; and I wiſhed, alſo, to give you an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of contradicting a report, which would have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned me conſiderable uneaſineſs, if I could have believed it. Happily I had too much confidence in my ſon to credit this; and I affirmed that he too well underſtood what was due both to his family and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to take any ſtep derogatory from the dignity of either. My motive for this converſation, therefore, is merely to afford you a moment for refuting the calumny I ſhall mention, and to obtain for myſelf authority for contradicting it to the perſons who have communicated it to me."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi waited impatiently for the concluſion of this exordium, and then begged to be informed of the ſubject of the report.</p>
                     <p>"It is ſaid." reſumed the Marcheſe, "that there is a young woman, who is called Ellena Roſalba—I think that is the name;—do you know any perſon of the name?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="43" facs="unknown:032735_0041_0FF49340B47419C0"/>
"Do I know!" exclaimed Vivaldi, "but pardon me, pray proceed, my Lord."</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſe pauſed, and regarded his ſon with ſternneſs, but without ſurpriſe. "It is ſaid, that a young perſon of this name has contrived to faſcinate your affections, and"—</p>
                     <p>"It is moſt true, my Lord, that Signora Roſalba has won my affections," interrupted Vivaldi with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt impatience, "but without contrivance."</p>
                     <p>"I will not be interrupted," ſaid the Marcheſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting in his turn. "It is ſaid that ſhe has ſo artfully adapted her temper to yours, that, with the aſſiſtance of a relation who lives with her, ſhe has reduced you to the degrading ſituation of her devoted ſuitor."</p>
                     <p>"Signora R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſalba has, my Lord, exalted me to the honour of being her ſuitor," ſaid Vivaldi, unable lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to command his feelings. He was proceeding, when the Marcheſe abruptly checked him, "You avow your folly then!"</p>
                     <p>"My Lord, I glory in my choice."</p>
                     <p>"Young men," rejoined his father, "as this is the arrogance and romantic enthuſiaſm of a boy, I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to forgive it for once, and obſerve me, only for once. If you will acknowledge your error, inſtantly diſmiſs this new favourite."—</p>
                     <p>"My Lord!"</p>
                     <p>"You muſt inſtantly diſmiſs her," repeated the Marcheſe with ſternner emphaſis; "and, to prove that I am more merciful than juſt, I am willing, on this condition, to allow her a ſmall annuity as ſome repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the depravity, into which you have aſſiſted to ſink her."</p>
                     <p>"My Lord!" exclaimed Vivaldi aghaſt, and ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly daring to truſt his voice; "my Lord!—depravity!" ſtruggling for breath. "Who has dared to pollute her ſpotleſs fame by inſulting your ears with ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:032735_0042_0FF4939457ADB8C8"/>
falfehoods? Tell me, I conjure you, inſtantly tell me, that I may haſten to give him his reward—Depravity!—an annuity—an annnity! O Ellena! Ellena!" As he pronounced her name tears of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs mingled with thoſe of indignation.</p>
                     <p>"Young man," ſaid the Marcheſe, who had obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the violence of his emotion with ſtrong diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and alarm, "I do not lightly give faith to report, and I cannot ſuffer myſelf to doubt the truth of what I have advanced. You are deceived, and your vanity will continue the deluſion, unleſs I condeſcend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert my authority, and tear the veil from your eyes. Diſmiſs her inſtantly, and I will adduce proof of her former character which will ſtagger even your faith, enthuſiaſtic as it is."</p>
                     <p>"Diſmiſs her!" repeated Vivaldi, with calm yet ſtern energy, ſuch as his father had never ſeen him aſſume; "My Lord, you have never yet doubted my word, and I now pledge you that honourable word, that Ellena is innocent. Innocent! O heavens, that it ſhould ever be neceſſary to affirm ſo, and, above all, that it ſhould ever be neceſſary for me to vindicate her!"</p>
                     <p>"I muſt indeed lament that it ever ſhould," replied the Marcheſe coldly. "You have pledged your word, which I cannot queſtion. I believe, therefore, that you are deceived; that you think her virtuous, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding your midnight viſits to her houſe. And grant ſhe is, unhappy boy! what reparation can you make her for the infatuated folly, which has thus ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her character? What"—</p>
                     <p>"By proclaiming to the world, my Lord, that ſhe is worthy of becoming my wife," replied Vivaldi, with a glow of countenance which announced the courage and exultation of a virtuous mind.</p>
                     <p>"Your wife!" ſaid the Marcheſe with a look of ineffable diſdain, which was inſtantly ſucceeded by one
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:032735_0043_0FF4934A83528660"/>
of angry alarm,—"If I believed you could ſo far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get what is due to the honour of your houſe, I would for ever diſclaim you as my ſon."</p>
                     <p>"O! why," exclaimed Vivaldi, in an agony of conflicting paſſions, "why ſhould I be in danger of forgetting what is due to a father, when I am only aſſerting what is due to innocence; when I am only defending her, who has no other to defend her! Why may not I be permitted to reconcile duties ſo conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial! But, be the event what it may, I will defend the oppreſſed, and glory in the virtue, which teaches me, that it is the firſt duty of humanity to do ſo. Yes, my Lord, if it muſt be ſo, I am ready to ſacrifice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior duties to the grandeur of a principle, which ought to expand all hearts and impel all actions. I ſhall beſt ſupport the honour of my houſe by adhering to its dictates."</p>
                     <p>"Where is the principle;" ſaid the Marcheſe, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently, "which ſhall teach you to diſobey a father? where is the virtue which ſhall inſtruct you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade your family?"</p>
                     <p>"There can be no degradation, my Lord, where there is no vice," replied Vivaldi; "and are inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, pardon me, my Lord, there are ſome few inſtances in which it is virtuous to diſobey."</p>
                     <p>"This paradoxical morality," ſaid the Marcheſe, with paſſionate diſpleaſure, "and this romantic lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, ſufficiently explain to me the character of your aſſociates, and the innocence of her, whom you defend with ſo chivalric an air. Are you to learn, Signor, that you belong to your family, not your family to you; that you are only a guardian of its honour, and not at liberty to diſpoſe of yourſelf? My patience will endure no more!"</p>
                     <p>Nor could the patience of Vivaldi endure this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated attack on the honour of Ellena. But while he yet aſſerted her innocence, he endeavoured to do ſo
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:032735_0044_0FF4939DD5B2B3E8"/>
with the temper, which was due to the preſence of a father; and, though he maintained the independence of a man, he was equally anxious to preſerve inviolate the duties of a ſon. But unfortunately the Marcheſe and Vivaldi differed in opinion concerning the limits of theſe duties; the firſt extending them to paſſive obedience, and the latter conceiving them to conclude at a point, wherein the happinefs of an individual is ſo deeply concerned as in marriage. They parted mutually inflamed; Vivaldi unable to prevail with his father to mention the name of his infamous infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, or to acknowledge himſelf convinced of Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's innocence; and the Mercheſe equally unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his endeavours to obtain from his ſon a promiſe that he would ſee her no more.</p>
                     <p>Here then was Vivaldi, who only a few ſhort hours before, had experienced a happineſs ſo ſupreme as to efface all impreſſions of the paſt, and to annihilate every conſideration of the future; a joy ſo full that it permitted him not to believe it poſſible that he could ever again taſte of miſery; he, who had felt as if that moment was an eternity, rendering him independent of all others,—even he was thus ſoon fallen into the region of time and of ſuffering.</p>
                     <p>The preſent conflict of paſſion appeared endleſs; he loved his father, and would have been more ſhocked to conſider the vexation he was preparing for him, had he not been reſentful of the contempt he expreſſed for Ellena. He adored Ellena; and, while he felt the impracticability of reſigning his hopes, was equally indignant of the ſlander, which affected her name, and impatient to avenge the inſult upon the original defamer.</p>
                     <p>Though the diſpleaſure of his father concerning a marriage with Ellena had been already foreſeen, the experience of it was ſeverer and more painful than he had imagined; while the indignity offered to Ellena
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:032735_0045_0FF4934C0B2FC118"/>
was as unexpected as intolerable. But this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance furniſhed him with an additional argument for addreſſing her; for, if it had been poſſible that his love could have pauſed, his honour ſeemed now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in her behalf; and, ſince he had been a means of ſullying her fame, it became his duty to reſtore it. Willingly liſtening to the dictates of a duty ſo plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, he determined to perſevere in his original deſign. But his firſt efforts were directed to diſcover her ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, and recollecting, with ſurpriſe, thoſe words of the Marcheſe, which had confeſſed a knowledge of his evening viſits to the villa Altieri, the doubtful warnings of the monk ſeemed explained. He believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that this man was at once the ſpy of his ſteps, and the defamer of his love, till the inconſiſtency of ſuch conduct with the ſeeming friendlineſs of his admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſtruck Vivaldi and compelled him to believe the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, the heart of Ellena had been little leſs tranquil. It was divided by love and pride; but had ſhe been acquainted with the circumſtances of the late interview between the Marcheſe and Vivaldi, it would have been divided no longer, and a juſt regard for her own dignity would inſtantly have taught her to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due, without difficulty, this infant affection.</p>
                     <p>Signora Bianchi had informed her niece of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Vivaldi's viſit; but ſhe had ſoftened the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectionable circumſtances that attended his propoſal, and had, at firſt, merely hinted that it was not to be ſuppoſed his family would approve a connection with any perſon ſo much their inferior in rank as herſelf. Ellena, alarmed by this ſuggeſtion, replied, that, ſince ſhe believed ſo, ſhe had done right to reject Vivaldi's ſuit; but her ſigh, as ſhe ſaid this, did not eſcape the obſervation of Signora Bianchi, who ventured to add, that ſhe had not abſolutely rejected his offers.</p>
                     <p>While in this and future converſations, Ellena was
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:032735_0046_0FF4939F5DCBC6F0"/>
pleaſed to perceive her ſecret admiration thus juſtified by an approbation ſo indiſputable as that of her aunt, and was willing to believe that the circumſtances, which had alarmed her juſt pride, was no ſo humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating as ſhe at firſt imagined. Bianchi was careful to conceal the real conſiderations, which had induced her to liſten to Vivaldi, being well aſſured that they would have no weight with Ellena, whoſe generous heart and inexperienced mind would have revolted from mingling any motives of intereſt with an engagement ſo ſacred as that of marriage. When, however, from further deliberation upon the advantages, which ſuch an alliance muſt ſecure for her niece, Signora Bianchi determined to encourage his views, and to direct the mind of Ellena, whoſe affections were already engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on her ſide, the opinions of the latter were found leſs ductile than had been expected. She was ſhocked at the idea of entering clandeſtinely the family of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi. But Bianchi, whoſe infirmities urged her wiſhes, was now ſo ſtrongly convinced of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſuch an engagement for her niece, that ſhe determined to prevail over her reluctance, though ſhe perceived that this muſt be by means more gradual and perſuaſive than ſhe had believed neceſſary. On the evening, when Vivaldi had ſurpriſed from Ellena an acknowledgement of her ſentiments, her embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment and vexation, on her returning to the houſe, and relating what had occurred, ſufficiently expreſſed to Signora Bianchi the exact ſituation of her heart. And when, on the following morning, his letter arrived, written with the ſimplicity and energy of truth, the aunt neglected not to adapt her remarks upon it, to the character of Ellena, with her uſual addreſs.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, after the late interview with the Marcheſe paſſed the remainder of the day in conſidering various plans, which might diſcover to him the perſon, who had abuſed the credulity of his father; and in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:032735_0047_0FF4934D91E79670"/>
he returned once more to the villa Altieri, not in ſecret to ſerenade the dark balcony of his miſtreſs, but openly, and to converſe with Signora Bianchi, who now received him more courteouſly than on his former viſit. Attributing the anxiety in his countenance to the uncertainty, concerning the diſpoſition of her niece, ſhe was neither ſurpriſed nor offended, but ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to relieve him from a part of it, by encouraging his hopes. Vivaldi dreaded leſt ſhe ſhould enquire further reſpecting the ſentiments of his family, but ſhe ſpared both his delicacy and her own on this point; and, after a converſation of conſiderable length, he left the villa Altieri with a heart ſomewhat ſoothed by approbation, and lightened by hope, although he had not obtained a ſight of Ellena. The diſcloſure ſhe had made of her ſentiments on the preceding evening, and the hints ſhe had received as to thoſe of his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſtill wrought upon her mind with too much effect to permit an interview.</p>
                     <p>Soon after his return to Naples, the Marcheſa, whom he was ſurpriſed to find diſengaged, ſent for him to her cloſet, where a ſcene paſſed ſimilar to that which had occurred with his father, except that the Marcheſa was more dexterous in her queſtions, and more ſubtle in her whole conduct; and that Vivaldi, never for a moment, forgot the decorum which was due to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Managing her paſſions, rather than exaſperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and deceiving him with reſpect to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of reſentment ſhe felt from his choice, ſhe was leſs paſſionate than the Marcheſe in her obſervations and menaces, perhaps, only becauſe ſhe entertained more hope than he did of preventing the evil ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi quitted her, unconvinced by her argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, unſubdued by her prophecies, and unmoved in his deſigns. He was not alarmed, becauſe he did not ſufficiently underſtand her character to apprehend her
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:032735_0048_0FF493A0E55B5AC0"/>
purpoſes. Deſpairing to effect theſe by open vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, ſhe called in an auxiliary of no mean talents, and whoſe character and views well adapted him to be an inſtrument in her hands. It was, perhaps, the baſeneſs of her own heart, not either depth of reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or keenneſs of penetration, which enabled her to underſtand the nature of his; and ſhe determined to modulate that nature to her own views.</p>
                     <p>There lived in the Dominican convent of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rito Santo, at Naples, a man called father Schedoni; an Italian, as his name imported, but whoſe family was unknown, and from ſome circumſtances, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that he wiſhed to throw an impenetrable veil over his origin. For whatever reaſon, he was never heard to mention a relative, or the place of his nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and he had artfully eluded every enquiry that approached the ſubject, which the curioſity of his aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates had occaſionally prompted. There were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, however, which appeared to indicate him to be a man of birth, and of fallen fortune; his ſpirit, as it had ſometimes looked forth from under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of his manners, ſeemed lofty; it ſhewed not, however, the aſpirings of a generous mind, but rather the gloomy pride of a diſappointed one. Some few perſons in the convent, who had been intereſted by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> appearance, believed that the peculiarities of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, his ſevere reſerve and unconquerable ſilence, his ſolitary habits and frequent penances, were the effect of misfortunes preying upon a haughty and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſpirit; while others conjectured them the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of ſome hideous crime gnawing upon an awakened conſcience.</p>
                     <p>He would ſometimes abſtract himſelf from the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety for whole days together, or when with ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition he was compelled to mingle with it, he ſeemed unconſcious where he was, and continued ſhrouded in meditation and ſilence till he was again
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:032735_0049_0FF49400F5EB40D0"/>
alone. There were times when it was unknown whither he had retired, notwithſtanding that his ſteps had been watched, and his cuſtomary haunts examined. No one ever heard him complain. The elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the convent ſaid that he had talents, but denied him learning; they applauded him for the profound ſubtlety which he occaſionally diſcovered in argument, but obſerved that he ſeldom perceived truth when it lay on the ſurface; he could follow it through all the labyrinths of diſquiſition, but overlooked it, when it was undiſguiſed before him. In fact he cared not for truth, nor ſought it by bold and broad argument, but loved to exert the wily cunning of his nature in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it through artificial perplexities. At length, from a habit of intricacy and ſuſpicion, his vitiated mind could receive nothing for truth, which was ſimple and eaſily comprehended.</p>
                     <p>Among his aſſociates no one loved him, many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked him, and more feared him. His figure was ſtriking, but not ſo from grace; it was ſtall, and, though extremely thin, his limbs were large and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth, and as he ſtalked along, wrapt in the black garments of his order, there was ſomething terrible in its air; ſomething almoſt ſuperhuman. His cowl, too, as it threw a ſhade over the livid paleneſs of his face, increaſed its ſevere character, and gave an effect to his large melancholy eye, which approached to hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. His was not the melancholy of a ſenſible and wounded heart, but apparently that of a gloomy and ferocious diſpoſition. There was ſomething in his phyſiognomy extremely ſingular, and that cannot eaſily be defined. It bore the traces of many paſſions, which ſeemed to have fixed the features they no longer ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated. An habitual gloom and ſeverity prevailed over the deep lines of his countenance; and his eyes were ſo piercing, that they ſeemed to penetrate at a ſingle glance into the hearts of men, and to read their
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:032735_0050_0FF493A26BD1D5A0"/>
moſt ſecret thoughts; few perſons could ſupport their ſcrutiny, or even endure to meet them twice. Yet, notwithſtanding all this gloom and auſterity, ſome rare occaſions of intereſt had called forth a character upon his countenance entirely different; and he could adapt himſelf to the tempers and paſſions of perſons, whom he wiſhed to conciliate, with aſtoniſhing faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and generally with complete triumph. This monk, this Schedoni, was the confeſſor and ſecret ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſer of the Marcheſa di Vivaldi. In the firſt effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcence of pride and indignation, which the diſcovery of her ſon's intended marriage occaſioned, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted him on the means of preventing it, and ſhe ſoon perceived that his talents promiſed to equal her wiſhes. Each poſſeſſed, in a conſiderable degree, the power of aſſiſting the other; Schedoni had ſubtlety with ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to urge it; and the Marcheſa had inexorable pride, and courtly influence; the one hoped to obtain a high benefice for his ſervices, and the other to ſecure the imaginary dignity of her houſe, by her gifts. Prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch paſſions, and allured by ſuch views, they concerted in private, and unknown even to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſe, the means of accompliſhing their general end.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, as he quitted his mother's cloſet, had met Schedoni in the corridor leading thither. He knew him to be her confeſſor, and was not much ſurpriſed to ſee him, though the hour was an unuſual one. Schedoni bowed his head, as he paſſed, and aſſumed a meek and holy countenance; but Vivaldi, as he eyed him with a penetrating glance, now recoiled with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary emotion; and it ſeemed as if a ſhuddering preſentiment of what this monk was preparing for him had croſſed his mind.</p>

                     <p>VIVALDI, from the period of his laſt viſit to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieri, was admitted a frequent viſitor to Signora Bian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi, and Ellena was prevailed upon to join the party, when the converſation was always on different topics. Bianchi, underſtanding the diſpoſition of her niece's affections, and the accompliſhed mind and manners of Vivaldi, judged that he was more likely to ſucceed by ſilent attentions than by a formal declaration of his ſentiments. By ſuch declaration, Ellena, till her heart was more engaged in his cauſe, would, perhaps, have been alarmed into an abſolute rejection of his addreſſes, and this was every day leſs likely to happen ſo long as he had an opportunity of converſing with her.</p>
                     <p>Signora Bianchi had acknowledged to Vivaldi that he had no rival to apprehend; that Ellena had uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly rejected every admirer who had hitherto diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her within the ſhade of her retirement, and that her preſent reſerve proceeded more from conſiderations of the ſentiments of his family than from diſapproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf. He forbore, therefore, to preſs his ſuit, till he ſhould have ſecured a ſtronger intereſt in her heart, and in this hope he was encouraged by Signora Bianchi, whoſe gentle remonſtrances in his favour became every day more pleaſing and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing.</p>
                     <p>Several weeks paſſed away in this kind of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, till Ellena, yielding to the repreſentations of Signora Bianchi, and to the pleadings of her own
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:032735_0052_0FF493AE50FDC6F8"/>
heart, received Vivaldi as an acknowledged admirer, and the ſentiments of his family were no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, or if remembered, it was with a hope that they might be overcome by conſiderations more powerful.</p>
                     <p>The lovers, with Signora Bianch and Signor Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otto, a diſtant relation of the latter, frequently made excurſions in the delightful environs of Naples; for Vivaldi was no longer anxious to conceal his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but wiſhed to contradict any report injurious to his love, by the publicity of his conduct; while the conſideration, that Ellena's name had ſuffered by his late imprudence, contributed, with the unſuſpecting innocence and ſweetneſs of her manners towards him, who had been the occaſion of her injuries, to mingle a ſecret pity with his love, which obliterated all family politics from his mind, and bound her irrecoverably to his heart.</p>
                     <p>Theſe excurſions ſometimes led them to Puzzuoli, Baia, or the woody cliffs of Pauſilippo, and as, on their return, they glided along the moon-light bay, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodies of Italian ſtrains ſeemed to give enchantment to the ſcenery of this ſhore. At this cool hour the voices of the vine-dreſſers were frequently heard in trio, as they repoſed from the labour of the day, on ſome pleaſant promontory, under the ſhade of poplars; or the briſk muſic of the dance from fiſhermen, on the margin of the waves below. The boatmen reſted on their oars, while their company liſtened to voices mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulated by ſenſibility to finer eloquence, than is in the power of art alone to diſplay; and at others, while they obſerved the airy natural grace which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes the dance of the fiſhermen and peaſants of Naples. Frequently as they glided round a promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, whoſe ſhaggy maſſes impended <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

do juſtice to. The deep clear waters reflected every image of the landſcape, the cliffs, branching into wild forms, crowned with groves, whoſe rough foli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age often ſpread down their ſteeps in pictureſque lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriance; the ruined villa on ſome bold point, peeping through the trees; peaſants cabins hanging on the precipices, and the dancing figures on the ſtrand—all touched with the ſilver tint and ſoft ſhadows of moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. On the other hand, the ſea trembling with a long line of radiance, and ſhewing in the clear diſtance the ſails of veſſels ſtealing in every direction along its ſurface, preſented a proſpect as grand as the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape was beautiful.</p>
                     <p>One evening that Vivaldi ſat with Ellena and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora Bianchi, in the very pavilion where he had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard that ſhort but intereſting ſoliloquy, which aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him of her regard, he pleaded with more than his uſual earneſtneſs for a ſpeedy marriage. Bianchi did not oppoſe his arguments; ſhe had been ill for ſome time, and believing herſelf to be declining faſt, was anxious to have their nuptials concluded. She ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed with languid eyes the ſcene that ſpread before the pavilion.

"Alas!" ſaid ſhe, breaking from meditative ſilence, "this ſun ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which lights up all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

alas! I feel that it will not long ſhine for me—my eyes muſt ſoon cloſe upon the proſpect for ever!"</p>
                     <p>To Ellena's tender reproach for this melancholy ſuggeſtion Bianchi replied only by expreſſing an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt wiſh to witneſs the certainty of her being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected; adding, that this muſt be ſoon, or ſhe ſhould not live to ſee it. Ellena, extremely ſhocked both by this preſage of her aunt's fate, and by the direct refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence made to her own condition in the preſence of Vivaldi, burſt into tears, while he, ſupported by the wiſhes of Signora Bianchi, urged his ſuit with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed intereſt.</p>
                     <p>"This is not a time for faſtidious ſcruples," ſaid Bianchi, "now that a ſolemn truth calls out to us. My dear girl, I will not diſguiſe my feelings; they aſſure me I have not long to live. Grant me then the only requeſt I have to make, and my laſt hours will be comforted."</p>
                     <p>After a pauſe ſhe added, as ſhe took the hand of her niece, "This will, no doubt, be an awful ſeparation to us both; and it muſt alſo be a mournful one, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor," turning to Vivaldi, "for ſhe has been as a daughter to me, and I have, I truſt, fulfilled to her the duties of a mother. Judge then, what will be her feelings when I am no more. But it will be your care to ſooth them."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi looked at Ellena, and would have ſpoken; her aunt, however, proceeded. "My own feelings would now be little leſs poignant, if I did not believe that I was confiding her to a tenderneſs, which cannot diminiſh; that I ſhould prevail with her to accept the protection of a huſband. To you, Signor, I commit the legacy of my child. Watch over her future mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, guard her from inquietude as vigilantly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> I have done, and, if poſſible; from misfortune! I have yet much to ſay, but my ſpirits are exhauſted."</p>
                     <p>While he liſtened to this ſacred charge, and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:032735_0055_0FF4940EF39E08F8"/>
the injury Ellena had already ſuſtained for his ſake, by the cruel obloquy which the Marcheſe had thrown upon her character, he felt a degree of gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous indignation, of which he ſcarcely could conceal the cauſe, and a ſucceeding tenderneſs that almoſt melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to tears; and he ſecretly vowed to defend her fame and protect her peace, at the ſacrifice of every other conſideration.</p>
                     <p>Bianchi, as ſhe concluded her exhortation, gave Ellena's hand to Vivaldi, who received it with emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuch as his countenance, only, could expreſs, and with ſolemn fervour raiſing his eyes to heaven, vowed that he never would betray the confidence thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in him, but would watch over the happineſs of Ellena with a care as tender, as anxious, and as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſing as her own; that from this moment he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himſelf bound by ties not leſs ſacred than thoſe which the church confers to defend her as his wife, and would do ſo to the lateſt moment of his exiſtence. As he ſaid this, the truth of his feelings appeared in the energy of his manner.</p>
                     <p>Ellena, ſtill weeping, and agitated by various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, ſpoke not, but withdrawing the handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief from her face, looked at him through her tears, with a ſmile ſo meek, ſo affectionate, ſo timid, yet ſo confiding, as expreſſed all the mingled emotions of her heart, and appealed more eloquently to his, than the moſt energetic language could have done.</p>
                     <p>Before Vivaldi left the villa, he had ſome further converſation with Signora Bianchi, when it was agreed that the nuptials ſhould be ſolemnized on the following week, if Ellena could be prevailed on to confirm her conſent ſo ſoon; and that when he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the next day, her determination would probably be made known to him.</p>
                     <p>He departed for Naples once more with the lightly-bounding ſteps of joy, which, however, when he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:032735_0056_0FF493B163534620"/>
there, was ſomewhat alloyed by a meſſage from the Marcheſe, demanding to ſee him in his cabinet. Vivaldi anticipated the ſubject of the interview, and obeyed the ſummons with reluctance.</p>
                     <p>He found his father ſo abſorbed in thought that he did not immediately perceive him. On raiſing his eyes from the floor, where diſcontent and perplexity ſeemed to have held them, he fixed a ſtern regard on Vivaldi. "I underſtand," ſaid he, "that you perſiſt in the unworthy purſuit againſt which I warned you. I have left you thus long to your own diſcretion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was willing to afford you an opportunity of retracting with grace the declaration, which you dared to make me of your principles and intentions; but your conduct has not therefore been leſs obſerved. I am informed that your viſits have been as frequent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the reſidence of the unhappy young woman, who was the ſubject of our former converſation, as formerly, and that you are as much infatuated."</p>
                     <p>"If it is Signora Roſalba, whom your lordſhip means," ſaid Vivaldi, "ſhe is not unhappy; and I do not ſcruple to own, that I am as ſincerely attached to her as ever. Why, my dear father," continued he, ſubduing the feelings which this degrading mention of Ellena had arouſed, "why will you perſiſt in oppoſing the happineſs of your ſon; and above all, why will you continue to think unjuſtly of her, who deſerves your admiration as much as my love?"</p>
                     <p>"As I am not a lover." replied the Marcheſe, "and that the age of boyiſh credulity is paſt with me, I do not wilfully cloſe my mind againſt examination, but am directed by proof and yield to conviction."</p>
                     <p>"What proof is it my Lord, that has thus eaſily convinced you?" ſaid Vivaldi; "Who is it that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in abuſing your confidence, and in deſtroying my peace?"</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſe haughtily reproved his ſon for ſuch
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:032735_0057_0FF494107A541548"/>
doubts and queſtions, and a long converſation enſued, which ſeemed neither to reconcile the intereſts or the opinions of either party. The Marcheſe perſiſted in accuſation and menace; and Vivaldi in defending El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena, and in affirming, that his affections and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were unalterable.</p>
                     <p>Not any art of perſuaſion could prevail with the Marcheſe to adduce his proofs, or deliver up the name of his informer; nor any menace awe Vivaldi into a renunciation of Ellena; and they parted mutually diſſatisfied. The Marcheſe had failed on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to act with his uſual policy, for his menaces and accuſations had arouſed ſpirit and indignation, when kindneſs and gentle remonſtrance would certainly have awakened filial affection, and might have occaſioned a conteſt in the breaſt of Vivaldi. Now, no ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of oppoſing duties divided his reſolution. He had no heſitation on the ſubject of their diſpute; but regarding his father as a haughty oppreſſor who would rob him of his moſt ſacred right; and as one who did not ſcruple to ſtain the name of the innocent and the defenceleſs, when his intereſt required it, upon the doubtful authority of a baſe informer, he ſuffered neither pity or remorſe to mingle with the reſolution of aſſerting the freedom of his nature; and was even more anxious than before, to conclude a marriage which he believed would ſecure his own happineſs, and the reputation of Ellena.</p>
                     <p>He returned, therefore, on the following day to the villa Altieri, with encreaſed impatience to learn the reſult of Signora Bianchi's further converſation with her niece, and the day on which the nuptials might be ſolemnized. On the way thither, his thoughts were wholly occupied by Ellena, and he proceeded mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically, and without obſerving where he was, till the ſhade which the well known arch threw over the road recalled him to local circumſtances, and a voice
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:032735_0058_0FF493B2E817E2B0"/>
inſtantly arreſted his attention. It was the voice of the monk, whoſe figure again paſſed before him, "Go not to the villa Altieri," it ſaid ſolemnly, "for death is in the houſe!"</p>
                     <p>Before Vivaldi could recover from the diſmay into which this abrupt aſſertion and ſudden appearance had thrown him, the ſtranger was gone. He had eſcaped in the gloom of the place, and ſeemed to have retired into the obſcurity, from which he had ſo ſuddenly emerged, for he was not ſeen to depart from under the archway. Vivaldi purſued him with his voice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring him to appear, and demanding who was dead; but no voice replied.</p>
                     <p>Believing that the ſtranger could not have eſcaped unſeen from the arch by any way, but that leading to the fortreſs above, Vivaldi began to aſcend the ſteps, when, conſidering that the more certain means of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding this awful aſſertion would be, to go im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the villa Altieri, he left this portentous ruin and haſtened thither.</p>
                     <p>An indifferent perſon would probably have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the words of the monk to allude to Signora Bianchi, whoſe infirm ſtate of health rendered her death though ſudden not improbable; but to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted fancy of Vivaldi, the dying Ellena only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. His fears, however probabilities might ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the event juſtify them, were natural to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent affection; but they were accompanied by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiment as extraordinary as it was horrible;—it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to him more than once, that Ellena was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. He ſaw her wounded, and bleeding to death; ſaw her aſhy countenance, and her waſting eyes, from which the ſpirit of life was faſt departing, turned pite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly on himſelf, as if imploring him to ſave her from the fate that was dragging her to the grave. And, when he reached the boundary of the garden, his whole frame trembled ſo, with horrible apprehenſion, that he
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:032735_0059_0FF4941A66D04780"/>
reſted a while, unable to venture further towards the truth. At length he ſummoned courage to dare it, and, unlocking a private gate, of which he had lately received the key, becauſe it ſpared him a conſiderable diſtance of the road to Naples, he approached the houſe. Every place around it was ſilent and forſaken; many of the lattices were cloſed, and, as he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to collect from every trivial circumſtance ſome conjecture, his ſpirits ſtill ſunk as he advanced, till, having arrived within a few paces of the portico, all his fears were confirmed. He heard from within a feeble ſound of lamentation, and then ſome notes of that ſolemn and peculiar kind of recitative, which is in ſome parts of Italy the requiem of the dying. The ſounds were ſo low and diſtant that they only murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his ear; but, without pauſing for information, he ruſhed into the portico, and knocked loudly at the folding doors, now cloſed againſt him.</p>
                     <p>After repeated ſummonſes, Beatrice, the old houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, appeared. She did not wait for Vivaldi's enquiries. "Alas! Signor," ſaid ſhe, "alas-a-day! who would have thought it; who would have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a change as this! It was only yeſter-evening that you was here,—ſhe was then as well as I am; who would have thought that ſhe would be dead to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day?"</p>
                     <p>"She <hi>is</hi> dead, then!" exclaimed Vivaldi, ſtruck to the heart; "ſhe <hi>is</hi> dead!" ſtaggering towards a pillar of the hall, and endeavouring to ſupport himſelf againſt it. Beatrice, ſhocked at his condition, would have gone for aſſiſtance, but he waved her to ſtay. "When did ſhe die?" ſaid he, drawing breath with difficulty, "how and where?"</p>
                     <p>"Alas! here in the villa, Signor," replied Beatrice, weeping; "who would have thought that I ſhould live to ſee this day! I hoped to have laid down my old bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="62" facs="unknown:032735_0060_0FF493BE5B511E48"/>
"What has cauſed her death?" interrupted Vivaldi impatiently, "and when did ſhe die?"</p>
                     <p>"About two of the clock this morning, Signor; about two o'clock. O miſerable day, that I ſhould live to ſee it!"</p>
                     <p>"I am better," ſaid Vivaldi, raiſing himſelf, "lead me to her apartment,—I muſt ſee her. Do not heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, lead me on."</p>
                     <p>"Alas! Signor, it is a diſmal ſight; why ſhould you wiſh to ſee her? Be perſuaded; do not go, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; it is a woeful ſight!"</p>
                     <p>"Lead me on," repeated Vivaldi ſternly; "or if you refuſe, I will find the way myſelf."</p>
                     <p>Beatrice, terrified by his look and geſture, no longer oppoſed him, begging only that he would wait till ſhe had informed her lady of his arrival; but he followed her cloſely up the ſtaircaſe and along a corridor that led round the weſt ſide of the houſe, which brought him to a ſuite of chambers darkened by the cloſed lattices, through which we paſſed towards the one where the body lay. The requiem had ceaſed, and no ſound diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed the awful ſtillneſs that prevailed in theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted rooms. At the door of the laſt apartment, where he was compelled to ſtop, his agitation was ſuch, that Beatrice, expecting every inſtant to ſee him ſink to the floor, made an effort to ſupport him with her feeble aid, but he gave a ſignal for her to retire. He ſoon recovered himſelf and paſſed into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of death, the ſolemnity of which might have effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in any other ſtate of his ſpirits; but theſe were now too ſeverely preſſed upon by real ſuffering to feel the influence of local circumſtances. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the bed on which the corpſe was laid, he raiſed his eyes to the mourner who hung weeping over it, and beheld—Ellena! who, ſurpriſed by this ſudden intruſion, and ſtill more by the agitation of Vivaldi, repeatedly demanded the occaſion of it. But
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:032735_0061_0FF4941BEE5469A0"/>
he had neither power nor inclination to explain a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, which muſt deeply wound the heart of Ellena, ſince it would have told that the ſame event, which excited her grief, accidentally inſpired his joy.</p>
                     <p>He did not long intrude upon the ſacredneſs of ſor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>row, and the ſhort time he remained was employed in endeavours to command his own emotion and to ſoothe her's.</p>
                     <p>When he left Ellena, he had ſome converſation with Beatrice, as to the death of Signora Bianchi, and underſtood that ſhe had retired to reſt on the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing night apparently in her uſual ſtate of health. "It was about one in the morning Signor," continued Beatrice, "I was waked out of my firſt ſleep by a noiſe in my lady's chamber. It is a grievous thing to me, Signor, to be waked from my firſt ſleep, and I Santa Maria forgive me! was angry at being diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? So I would not get up, but laid my head upon the pillow again, and tried to ſleep; but preſently I heard the noiſe again; nay now, ſays I, ſomebody muſt be up in the houſe, that's certain. I had ſcarcely ſaid ſo, Signor, when I heard my young lady's voice call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 'Beatrice! Beatrice!' Ah! poor young lady! ſhe was indeed in a ſad fright, as well ſhe might. She was at my door in an inſtant, and looked as pale as death, and trembled ſo! 'Beatrice,' ſaid ſhe, 'riſe this moment; my aunt is dying.' She did not wait for my anſwer, but was gone directly. Santa Maria protect me! I thought I ſhould have ſwooned out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right."</p>
                     <p>"Well, but your lady?" ſaid Vivaldi, whoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience the tedious circumlocution of old Beatrice had exhauſted.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! my poor lady! Signor, I thought I never ſhould have been able to reach her room; and when I got there, I was ſcarcely more alive than herſelf.—There ſhe lay on her bed! O it was a grievous ſight
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:032735_0062_0FF493BFEDED1098"/>
to ſee! there ſhe lay, looking ſo piteouſly; I ſaw ſhe was dying. She could not ſpeak, though ſhe tried often, but ſhe was ſenſible, for ſhe would look ſo at Signora Ellena, and then try to ſpeak; it almoſt broke one's heart to ſee her. Something ſeemed to lie upon her mind, and ſhe tried almoſt to the laſt to tell it; and as ſhe graſped Signora Ellena's hand, ſhe would ſtill look up in her face with ſuch doleful expreſſion as no one who had not a heart of ſtone could bear. My poor young miſtreſs was quite overcome by it, and cried as if her heart would break. Poor young lady! ſhe has loſt a friend indeed, ſuch a one as ſhe muſt never hope to ſee again."</p>
                     <p>"But ſhe ſhall find one as firm and affectionate as the laſt!" exclaimed Vivaldi fervently.</p>
                     <p>"The good Saint grant it may prove ſo," replied Beatrice, doubtingly. "All that could be done for our dear lady," ſhe continued, "was tried, but with no avail. She could not ſwallow what the Doctor offered her. She grew fainter and fainter, yet would often utter ſuch deep ſighs, and then would graſp my hand ſo hard! At laſt ſhe turned her eyes from Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora Ellena, and they grew duller and fixed, and ſhe ſeemed not to ſee what was before her. Alas! I knew ſhe was going; her hand did not preſs mine as it had done a minute or two before, and a deadly coldneſs was upon it. Her face changed ſo too in a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes! This was about two o'clock, and ſhe died before her confeſſor could adminiſter."</p>
                     <p>Beatrice ceaſed to ſpeak, and wept; Vivaldi almoſt wept with her, and it was ſome time before he could command his voice ſufficiently to enquire, what were the ſymptoms of Signora Bianchi's diſorder, and whether ſhe had ever been thus ſuddenly attacked before.</p>
                     <p>"Never, Signor!" replied the old houſe-keeper;
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:032735_0063_0FF4941D779AFC40"/>
"and though to be ſure, ſhe had long been very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and going down, as one may ſay, yet,"—</p>
                     <p>"What is it you mean?" ſaid Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Why, Signor, I do not know what to think about my lady's death. To be ſure, there is nothing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and I may only get ſcoffed at, if I ſpeak my mind abroad, for nobody would believe me, it is ſo ſtrange, yet I muſt have my own thoughts, for all that."</p>
                     <p>"Pray ſpeak intelligibly," ſaid Vivaldi, "you need not apprehend cenſure from me."</p>
                     <p>"Not from you, Signor, but if the report ſhould get abroad, and it was known that I had ſet it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going."</p>
                     <p>"That never ſhall be known from me," ſaid Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, with increaſed impatience, "tell me, without fear, all that you conjecture."</p>
                     <p>"Well then, Signor, I will own, that I do not like the ſuddenneſs of my lady's death, no, nor the manner of it, nor her appearance after death!"</p>
                     <p>"Speak explicitly, and to the point," ſaid Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Nay, Signor, there are ſome folks that will not underſtand if you ſpeak ever ſo plain, I am ſure I ſpeak plain enough. If I might tell my mind,—I do not believe ſhe came fairly by her death at laſt."</p>
                     <p>"How!" ſaid Vivaldi, "your reaſons?"</p>
                     <p>"Nay, Signor, I have given them already; I ſaid I did not like the ſuddenneſs of her death, nor her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance after, nor"—</p>
                     <p>"Good heaven!" interrupted Vivaldi, "you mean poiſon."</p>
                     <p>"Huſh, Signor, huſh! I do not ſay that; but ſhe did not ſeem to die naturally."</p>
                     <p>"Who has been at the villa lately?" ſaid Vivaldi, in a tremulous voice.</p>
                     <p>"Alas! Signor, nobody has been here; ſhe lived ſo privately that ſhe ſaw nobody."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="unknown:032735_0064_0FF493C1755179A0"/>
"Not one perſon?" ſaid Vivaldi, "conſider well, Beatrice, had ſhe no viſitor?"</p>
                     <p>"Not of a long while, Signor, no viſitors but yourſelf and her couſin Signor Giotto. The only other perſon that has been within theſe walls for many weeks, to the beſt of my remembrance, is a ſiſter of the Convent, who comes for the ſilks my young lady embroiders."</p>
                     <p>"Embroiders! What convent?"</p>
                     <p>"The Santa Maria della Pieta, yonder, Signor; if you will ſtep this way to the window, I will ſhew it you. Yonder, among the woods on the hill-ſide, juſt above thoſe gardens that ſtretch down to the bay. There is an olive ground cloſe beſide it, and obſerve, Signor, there is a red and yellowiſh ridge of rocks riſes over the woods higher ſtill, and looks as if it would fall down upon thoſe old ſpires. Have you found it, Signor?"</p>
                     <p>"How long is it ſince this ſiſter came here?" ſaid Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"There weeks at leaſt, Signor."</p>
                     <p>"And you are certain that no other perſon has call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within that time?"</p>
                     <p>"No other, Signor, except the fiſherman and the gardener, and a man who brings maccaroni, and ſuch ſort of things; for it is ſuch a long way to Naples, Signor, and I have ſo little time."</p>
                     <p>"Three weeks, ſay you! You ſay three weeks, I think? Are you certain as to this?"</p>
                     <p>"Three weeks, Signor! Santa della Pieta! Do you believe, Signor, that we could faſt for three weeks! Why, they call almoſt every day."</p>
                     <p>"I ſpeak of the nun," ſaid Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"O yes, Signor," replied Beatrice; "it is that at leaſt, ſince ſhe was here."</p>
                     <p>"This is ſtrange!" ſaid Vivaldi, muſing, "but I will talk with you ſome other time. Meanwhile, I
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:032735_0065_0FF4941F01E3FA70"/>
wiſh you could contrive that I ſhould ſee the face of your deceaſed lady, without the knowledge of Signora Ellena. And, obſerve me, Beatrice, be ſtrictly ſilent as to your ſurmiſes concerning her death: do not ſuffer any negligence to betray your ſuſpicions to your young miſtreſs. Has ſhe any ſuſpicions herſelf of the ſame nature?"</p>
                     <p>Beatrice replied, that ſhe believed Signora Ellena had none: and promiſed faithfully to obſerve his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions.</p>
                     <p>He then left the villa, meditating on the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances he had juſt learned, and on the prophetic aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the monk, between whom, and the cauſe of Bianchi's ſudden death, he could not forbear ſurmiſing there was ſome connection, and it now occurred to him, and for the firſt time, that this monk, this myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtranger, was no other than Schedoni, whom he had obſerved of late going more frequently than uſual, to his mother's apartment. He almoſt ſtarted, in hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the ſuſpicion, to which this conjecture led, and precipitately rejected it, as a poiſon that would deſtroy his own peace for ever. But though he inſtantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed the ſuſpicion, the conjecture returned to his mind, and he endeavoured to recollect the voice and figure of the ſtranger, that he might compare them with thoſe of the confeſſor. The voices were, he thought, of a different tone, and the perſons of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent height and proportion. This compariſon, however, did not forbid him to ſurmiſe that the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was an agent of the confeſſor's; that he was, at leaſt, a ſecret ſpy upon his actions, and the defamer of Ellena; while both, if indeed there were two perſons concerned, appeared to be at the command of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Fired with indignation of the unworthy arts that he believed to have been employed againſt him, and impatient to meet the ſlanderer of Ellena, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to attempt ſome deciſive ſtep towards a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:032735_0066_0FF493C302976BF0"/>
of the truth, and either to compel the confeſſor to reveal it to him, or to ſearch out his agent, who, he fancied, was occaſionally a reſident within the ruins of Paluzzi.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants of the convent, which Beatrice had pointed out, did not eſcape his conſideration, but no reaſon appeared for ſuppoſing them the enemies of his Ellena, who, on the contrary, he underſtood had been for ſome years amicably connected with them. The embroidered ſilks, of which the old ſervant had ſpoken, ſufficiently explained the nature of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, and diſcovering more fully the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Ellena's fortune, her conduct heightened the tender admiration with which he had hitherto regarded her.</p>
                     <p>The hints for ſuſpicion which Beatrice had given reſpecting the cauſe of her miſtreſs's deceaſe, inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly recurred to him; and it appeared extraordinary, and ſometimes in the higheſt degree improbable, that any perſon could be ſufficiently intereſted in the death of a woman apparently ſo blameleſs, as to adminiſter p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ſon to her. What motive could have prompted ſo horrible a deed, was ſtill more inexplicable. It was true that ſhe had long been in a declining ſtate; yet the ſuddenneſs of her departure and the ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſome circumſtances preceding as well as ſome appearances that had followed it, compelled Vivaldi to doubt as to the cauſe. He believed, however, that, after having ſeen the corpſe, his doubts muſt vaniſh; and Beatrice had promiſed, that, if he could return in the evening, when Ellena had retired to reſt, he ſhould be permitted to viſit the chamber of the deceaſed. There was ſomething repugnant to his feelings, in going thus ſecretly, or, indeed, at all, to the reſidence of Ellena at this delicate period, yet it was neceſſary he ſhould introduce there ſome medical profeſſor, on whoſe judgment he could reſt,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:032735_0067_0FF4942A8A298060"/>
reſpecting the occaſion of Bianchi's death; and as he believed he ſhould ſoon acquire the right of vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the honour of Ellena, that conſideration did not ſo ſeriouſly affect him as otherwiſe it would have done. The enquiry which called him thither was, beſides, of a nature too ſolemn and important to be lightly reſigned; he had therefore, told Beatrice he would be punctual to the hour ſhe appointed. His intention to ſearch for the monk was thus again interrupted.</p>

                     <p>WHEN Vivaldi returned to Naples, he enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Marcheſa, of whom he wiſhed to aſk ſome queſtions concerning Schedoni, which, though he ſcarcely expected they would be explicitly anſwered, might yet lead to part of the truth he ſought for.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa was in her cloſet, and Vivaldi found the confeſſor with her. "This man croſſes me like my evil genius," ſaid he to himſelf as he entered, "but I will know whether he deſerves my ſuſpicions before I leave the room."</p>
                     <p>Schedoni was ſo deeply engaged in converſation, that he did not immediately perceive Vivaldi, who ſtood for a moment examining his countenance, and tracing ſubjects for curioſity in its deep lines. His eyes, while he ſpoke were caſt downward, and his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were fixed in an expreſſion at once ſevere and crafty. The Marcheſa was liſtening with deep at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, her head inclined towards him, as if to catch the loweſt murmur of his voice, and her face picturing the anxiety and vexation of her mind. This was evidently a conference, not a confeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi advancing, the monk raiſed his eyes; his countenance ſuffered no change, as they met thoſe of Vivaldi. He roſe, but did not take leave, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſlight and ſomewhat haughty ſalutation of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, with an inclination of the head, that indicated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pride without pettiſhneſs, and a firmneſs bordering o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> contempt.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa, on perceiving her ſon was ſomewhat embarraſſed, and her brow, before ſlightly contracted
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:032735_0069_0FF4942C11E15CB0"/>
by vexation, now frowned with ſeverity. Yet it was an involuntary emotion, for ſhe endeavoured to chaſe the expreſſion of it with a ſmile. Vivaldi liked the ſmile ſtill leſs than the frown.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni ſeated himſelf quietly, and began with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the eaſe of a man of the world, to converſe on general topics. Vivaldi, however, was reſerved and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; he knew not how to begin a converſation, which might lead to the knowledge he deſired, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa did not relieve him from the difficulty. His eye and his ear aſſiſted him at leaſt to conjecture at leaſt, if not to obtain the information he wiſhed; and, as he liſtened to the deep tones of Schedoni's voice, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came almoſt certain, that they were not the accents of his unknown adviſer, though he conſidered, at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ame moment, that it was not difficult to diſguiſe, or to feign a voice. His ſtature ſeemed to decide the queſtion more reaſonably; for the figure of Schedoni appeared taller than that of the ſtranger; and tho' there was ſomething of reſemblance in their air, which Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi had never obſerved before, he again conſidered, that the habit of the ſame order, which each wore, might eaſily occaſion an artificial reſemblance. Or the likeneſs, as to countenance, he could not judge, ſince the ſtranger had been ſo much ſhrouded by his cowl, that Vivaldi had never diſtinctly ſeen a ſingle feature. Schedoni's hood was now thrown back, ſo that he could not compare even the air of their heads under ſimilar circumſtances; but as he remembered to have ſeen the confeſſor on a former day approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his mother's cloſet with the cowl ſhading his face, the ſame gloomy ſeverity ſeemed to characterize both, and nearly the ſame terrible portrait was drawn on his fancy. Yet this again might be only an artificial effect, a character which the cowl alone gave to the head; and any face ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>en imperfectly beneath its dark ſhade, might have appeared equally ſevere. Vivaldi was
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:032735_0070_0FF493CECF249A28"/>
ſtill extremely perplexed in his opinion. One cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, however ſeemed to throw ſome light on his judgment. The ſtranger had appeared in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of a monk, and if Vivaldi's tranſient obſervation might be truſted, he was of the very ſame order with that of Schedoni, Yet if he were Schedoni, or even his agent, it was not probable that he would have ſhewn himſelf in a dreſs that might lead to a diſcovery of his perſon. That he was anxious for a conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his manner had ſtrongly proved; it ſeemed then, that this habit of a monk was only a diſguiſe, aſſumed for the purpoſe of miſleading conjecture. Vivaldi, however, determined to put ſome queſtions to Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni, and at the ſame time to obſerve their effect on his countenance. He took occaſion to notice ſome drawing of ruins, which ornamented the cabinet of the Marcheſa, and to ſay that the fortreſs of Paluzzi was worthy of being added to her collection. "You have ſeen it lately, perhaps, reverend father," added Vivaldi, with a penetrating glance.</p>
                     <p>"It is a ſtriking relique of antiquity," replied the confeſſor.</p>
                     <p>"That arch," reſumed Vivaldi, his eye ſtill fixed on Schedoni, "that arch ſuſpended between two rocks, the one overtopped by the towers of the fortreſs, the other ſhadowed with pine and broad oak, has a fine effect. But a picture of it would want human figures Now either the groteſque ſhapes of banditti lurking within the ruin, as if ready to ſtart out upon the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, or a friar rolled up in his black garments, juſt ſtealing forth from under the ſhade of the arch, and looking like ſome ſupernatural meſſenger of evil would finiſh the piece."</p>
                     <p>The features of Schedoni ſuffered no change dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſpeech. "Your picture in complete," ſaid he, "and I cannot but admire the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ecility with which you have claſſed the monks together with banditti."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="73" facs="unknown:032735_0071_0FF4942D9AB17F00"/>
"Your pardon, holy father," ſaid Vivaldi, "I did not draw a parallel between them."</p>
                     <p>"O! no offence, Signor," replied Schedoni, with a ſmile ſomewhat ghaſtly.</p>
                     <p>During the latter part of this converſation, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation it may be called, the Marcheſa had followed a ſervant, who had brought her a letter, out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, and as the confeſſor appeared to await her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, Vivaldi determined to preſs his enquiry. "It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, however," ſaid he, "that Paluzzi, if not haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by robbers, is at leaſt frequented by eccleſiaſtics; for I have ſeldom paſſed it without ſeeing one of the order, and that one has appeared ſo ſuddenly, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed ſo ſuddenly, that I have been almoſt compelled to believe he was literally a ſpiritual being!"</p>
                     <p>"The convent of the Black Penitents is not far diſtant," obſerved the confeſſor.</p>
                     <p>"Does the dreſs of this convent reſemble that of your order, reverend father? for I obſerved that the monk I ſpeak of was habited like yourſelf; aye and he was about your ſtature, and very much reſembled you."</p>
                     <p>"That well may be, Signor," replied the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor calmly; "there are many brethern who, no doubt, reſemble each other; but the brothers of the Black Penitents are clothed in ſackcloth; and the death's head on the garment, the peculiar ſymbol of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, would not have eſcaped your obſervation; it could not, therefore, be a member of their ſociety whom you have ſeen."</p>
                     <p>"I am not inclined to think that it was," ſaid Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi; "but be it who it may, I hope ſoon to be better acquainted with him, and to tell him truths ſo ſtrong, that he ſhall not be permitted even to affect the miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of them."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="unknown:032735_0072_0FF493D057DA00B8"/>
"You will do right, if you have cauſe of complaint againſt him," obſerved Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>"And only if I have cauſe of complaint, holy father? Are ſtrong truths to be told only when there is direct cauſe of complaint? Is it only when we are injured that we are to be ſincere?" He believed that he had now detected Schedoni, who ſeemed to have betrayed a conſciouſneſs that Vivaldi had reaſon for complaint againſt the ſtranger.</p>
                     <p>"You will obſerve, reverend father, that I have not ſaid I am injured," he added. "If you know that I am, this muſt be by other means than by my words: I have not even expreſſed reſentment."</p>
                     <p>"Except by your voice and eye, Signor," replied Schedoni drily. "When a man is vehement and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, we uſually are inclined to ſuppoſe he feels reſentment, and that he has cauſe of complaint, either real or imaginary. As I have not the honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquainted with the ſubject you allude to, I cannot decide to which of the two your cauſe belongs."</p>
                     <p>"I have never been in doubt as to that," ſaid Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi haughtily; "and if I had, you will pardon me, holy father, but I ſhould not have requeſted your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. My injuries are, alas! too real; and I now think it is alſo too certain to whom I may attribute them. The ſecret adviſer, who ſteals into the boſom of a family only to poiſon its repoſe, the informer—the baſe aſperſer of innocence, ſtand revealed in one perſon before me.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi delivered theſe words with a tempered ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, at once dignified and pointed, which ſeemed to ſtrike directly to the heart of Schedoni; but, whether it was his conſcience or his pride that took the alarm, did not certainly appear. Vivaldi believed the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. A dark malignity overſpread the features of the monk, and at that moment Vivaldi thought he beheld a man, whoſe paſſions might impel him to the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:032735_0073_0FF4943007CC0090"/>
of almoſt any crime, how hideous ſoever. He recoiled from him, as if he had ſuddenly ſeen a ſerpent in his path, and ſtood gazing on his face, with an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention ſo wholly occupied as to be unconſcious that he did ſo.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni almoſt inſtantly recovered himſelf; his features relaxed from their firſt expreſſion, and that portentous darkneſs paſſed away from his countenance; but with a look that was ſtill ſtern and haughty, he ſaid, "Signor, however ignorant I may be of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of your diſcontent, I cannot miſunderſtand that your reſentment is, to ſome extent or other, directed againſt myſelf as the cauſe of it. Yet I will not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Signor; I ſay I will not ſuppoſe," raiſing his voice ſignificantly, "that you have dared to brand me with the ignominious titles you have juſt uttered; but"—</p>
                     <p>"I have applied them to the author of my injuries," interrupted Vivaldi; "you, father, can beſt inform me whether they applied to yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>"I have then nothing to complain of," ſaid Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni, adroitly, and with a ſudden calmneſs, that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed Vivaldi. "If you directed them againſt the author of your injuries, whatever they may be, I am ſatisfied."</p>
                     <p>The chearful complacency, with which he ſpoke this, renewed the doubts of Vivaldi, who thought it nearly impoſſible that a man conſcious of guilt could aſſume, under the very charge of it, the tranquil and dignified air which the confeſſor now diſplayed. He began to accuſe himſelf of having condemned him with paſſionate raſhneſs, and gradually became ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the indecorum of his conduct towards a man of Schedoni's age and ſacred profeſſion. Thoſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of countenance, which had ſo much alarmed him, he was now inclined to think the effects of a jealous and haughty honour, and he almoſt forgot the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which had mingled with Schedoni's pride, in
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:032735_0074_0FF493D1E0432BA8"/>
ſorrow for the offence that had provoked it. Thus, not leſs precipitate in his pity than his anger, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous alike to the paſſion of the moment, he was now as eager to apologize for his error, as he had been haſty in committing it. The frankneſs, with which he apologized and lamented the impropriety of his conduct would have won an eaſy forgiveneſs from a generous heart. Schedoni liſtened with apparent complacency and ſecret contempt. He regarded Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi as a raſh boy, who was ſwayed only by his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; but while he ſuffered deep reſentment for the evil in his character, he felt neither reſpect nor kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the good, for the ſincerity, the love of juſtice, the generoſity, which threw a brilliancy even on his foibles. Schedoni, indeed, ſaw only evil in human nature.</p>
                     <p>Had the heart of Vivaldi been leſs generous, he would now have diſtruſted the ſatisfaction, which the confeſſor aſſumed, and have diſcovered the contempt and malignity, that lurked behind the ſmile thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly maſking his countenance. The confeſſor perceived his power, and the character of Vivaldi lay before him as a map. He ſaw, or fancied he ſaw every line and feature of its plan, and the relative propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of every energy and weakneſs of its nature. He believed, alſo, he could turn the very virtues of this young man againſt himſelf, and he exulted, even while the ſmile of good-will was yet upon his countenance, in anticipating the moment that ſhould avenge him for the paſt outrage, and which, while Vivaldi was ingenuouſly lamenting it, he had apparantly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni was thus ruminating evil againſt Vivaldi, and Vivaldi was conſidering how he might poſſibly make Schedoni atonement for the affront he had offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, when the Marcheſa returned to the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and perceived in the honeſt countenance of
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:032735_0075_0FF494387463E938"/>
Vivaldi ſome ſymptoms of the agitation which had paſſed over it; his complexion was fluſhed, and his brow was ſlightly contracted. The face of Schedoni told nothing but complacency, except that now and then when he looked at Vivaldi, it was with half ſhut eyes, that indicated treachery, or, at leaſt, cunning, try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to conceal exaſperated pride.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa, with diſpleaſure directed againſt her ſon, enquired the reaſon of his emotion; but he, ſtung with conſciouſneſs of his conduct towards the monk, could neither endure to explain it, or to remain in her preſence, and ſaying that he would confide his honour to the diſcretion of the holy father, who would ſpeak only too favourably of his fault, he abruptly left the room.</p>
                     <p>When he had departed, Schedoni gave, with ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reluctance, the explanation which the Marcheſa required, but was cautious not to ſpeak too favourably of Vivaldi's conduct, which, on the contrary, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as much more inſulting than it really was; and, while he aggravated the offenſive part of it, he ſuppreſſed all mention of the candour and ſelf-reproach, which had followed the charge. Yet this he managed ſo artfully that he appeared to extenuate Vivaldi's er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, to lament the haſtineſs of his temper, and to plead for a forgiveneſs from his irritated mother. "He is very young," added the monk, when he perceived that he had ſufficiently exaſperated the Marcheſa againſt her ſon; "he is very young, and youth is warm in its paſſions and precipitate in its judgments. He was, beſides, jealous, no doubt, of the friendſhip with which you are pleaſed to honour me; and it is natural that a ſon ſhould be jealous of the attention of ſuch a mother."</p>
                     <p>"You are too good, father," ſaid the Marcheſa; her reſentment encreaſing towards Vivaldi in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as Schedoni diſplayed his artificial candour and meekneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="78" facs="unknown:032735_0076_0FF493DCCF03C7D0"/>
"It is true," continued the confeſſor, "that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all the inconveniences to which my attachment, I ſhould ſay my duty, to your family expoſes me; but I willingly ſubmit to theſe, while it is yet poſſible that my advice may be a means of preſerving the honour of your houſe unſullied, and of ſaving this inconſiderate young man from future miſery and unavailing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance."</p>
                     <p>During the warmth of this ſympathy in reſentment, the Marcheſa and Schedoni mutually, and ſincerely, loſt their remembrance of the unworthy motives, by which each knew the other to be influenced, as well as that diſguſt which thoſe who act together to the ſame bad end, can ſeldom eſcape from feeling towards their aſſociates. The Marcheſa, while ſhe commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fidelity of Schedoni, forgot his views and her promiſes as to a rich benefice; while the confeſſor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted her anxiety for the ſplendor of her ſon's condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a real intereſt in his welfare, not a care of her own dignity. After mutual compliments had been exchanged, they proceeded to a long conſultation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Vivaldi, and it was agreed, that their efforts for what they termed his preſervation ſhould no longer be confined to remonſtrances.</p>

                     <p>VIVALDI, when his firſt feelings of pity and compunction for having inſulted an aged man, the member of a ſacred profeſſion, were paſt, and when he looked with a more deliberate eye upon ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the confeſſor's conduct, perceived that ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion was again gathering on his mind. But, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this as a ſymptom of his own weakneſs, rather than as a hint of truth, he endeavoured, with a magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous diſdain, to reject every ſurmiſe that boded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourably of Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>When evening arrived, he haſtened towards the villa Altieri, and, having met without the city, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to appointment, a phyſician, upon whoſe honour and judgment he thought he might rely, they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their way together. Vivaldi had forgotten, during the confuſion of his laſt interview with Ellena, to deliver up the key of the garden-gate, and he now entered it as uſual, though he could not entirely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the reluctance, which he felt on thus viſiting, in ſecret and at night, the dwelling of Ellena. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no other circumſtances, however, could the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, whoſe opinion was ſo neceſſary to his peace, be introduced without betraying a ſuſpicion, which muſt render her unhappy, probably for ever.</p>
                     <p>Beatrice, who had watched for them in the portico, led the way to the chamber where the corpſe was laid out; and Vivaldi, though conſiderably affected when he entered, ſoon recovered compoſure enough to take his ſtation on one ſide of the bed, while the phyſician placed himſelf on the other. Unwilling to expoſe his
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:032735_0078_0FF493DE54954598"/>
emotion to the obſervation of a ſervant, and deſirous alſo of ſome private converſation with the phyſician, he took the lamp from Beatrice and diſmiſſed her.—As the light glared upon the livid face of the corpſe, Vivaldi gazed with melancholy ſurpriſe, and an effort of reaſon was neceſſary to convince him, that this was the ſame countenance which only one evening preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was animated like his own; which had looked upon him in tears, while, with anxiety the moſt tender, ſhe had committed the happineſs of her niece to his care, and had, alas! too juſtly predicted her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching diſſolution. The circumſtances of that ſcene now appeared to him like a viſion, and touched every fibre of his heart. He was fully ſenſible of the importance of the truſt committed to him, and, as he now hung over the pale and deſerted form of Bianchi, he ſilently renewed his ſolemn vows to Ellena, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the confidence of her departed guardian.</p>
                     <p>Before Vivaldi had courage enough to aſk the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the phyſician, who was ſtill viewing the face of the deceaſed with very earneſt attention and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving countenance, his own ſuſpicions ſtrengthened from ſome circumſtances of her appearance; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly from the black tint that prevailed over her complexion, it ſeemed to him, that her death had been by poiſon. He ſeared to break a ſilence, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed his hope of the contrary, feeble though it was; and the phyſician, who probably was apprehenſive for the conſequence of delivering his real thoughts, did not ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>"<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> read your opinion," ſaid Vivaldi, at length, "it coincides with my own."</p>
                     <p>"I know not as to that, Signor," replied the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, "though I think I perceive what is yours. Appearances are unfavourable, yet I will not take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to decide from them, that it is as you ſuſpect. There are other circumſtances, under which ſimilar
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:032735_0079_0FF4943B89CBFAF8"/>
appearances might occur." He gave his reaſons for this aſſertion, which were plauſible even to Vivaldi, and concluded with requeſting to ſpeak with Beatrice, "for I wiſh to underſtand," ſaid he, "what was the exact ſituation of this lady for ſome hours previous to her deceaſe."</p>
                     <p>After a coverſation of ſome length with Beatrice, whatever might be the opinion reſulting from his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, he adhered nearly to his former aſſertions; pronouncing that ſo many contradictory circumſtances appeared, as rendered it impoſſible for him to decide, whether Bianchi had died by poiſon, or otherwiſe. He ſtated more fully than he had done before the reaſons which muſt render the opinion of any medical perſon, on this ſubject, doubtful. But, whether it was that he feared to be reſponſible for a deciſion, which would accuſe ſome perſon of murder, or that he really was inclined to believe that Bianchi died naturally, it is certain he ſeemed diſpoſed to adopt the latter opinion; and that he was very anxious to quiet the ſuſpicions of Vivaldi. He ſo far ſucceeded, indeed, as to convince him that it would be unavailing to purſue the enquiry, and almoſt compelled him to believe, that ſhe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted according to the common courſe of nature.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, having lingered a while over the death-bed of Bianchi, and taken a laſt farewell of her ſilent form, quitted the chamber and the houſe as ſoftly as he had approached, and unobſerved, as he believed, by Ellena or any other perſon. The morning dawned over the ſea, when he returned into the garden, and a few fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermen, loitering on the beach, or putting off their little boats from the ſhore, were the only perſons viſible at this early hour. The time, however, was paſſed for renewing the enquiry he had purpoſed at Paluzzi, and the brightening dawn warned him to retire. To Naples, therefore, he returned, with ſpirits ſomewhat
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:032735_0080_0FF493DFDBCF5AB0"/>
ſoothed by a hope, that Bianchi had not fallen prema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely, and by the certainty that Ellena was well. On the way thither, he paſſed the fort without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and, having parted with the phyſician, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into his father's manſion by a confidential ſervant.</p>

                     <p>ELLENA, on thus ſuddenly loſing her aunt, her only relative, the friend of her whole life, felt as if left alone in the world. But it was not in the firſt moment of affliction that this feeling occurred. Her own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn ſituation was not even obſerved, while affection, pity, and irreſiſtible grief for Bianchi, occupied her heart.</p>
                     <p>Bianchi was to be interred in the church belonging to the convent of Santa Maria della Pieta. The body attired according to the cuſtom of the country, and decorated with flowers, was carried on an open bier to the place of interment, attended only by prieſts and torch-bearers. But Ellena could not endure thus lightly to part with the reliques of a beloved friend, and being reſtrained by cuſtom from following the corpſe to the grave, ſhe repaired firſt to the convent, to attend the funeral ſervice. Her ſorrow did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her to join in the choral ſymphonies of the nuns, but their ſacred ſolemnity was ſoothing to her ſpirits, and the tears ſhe ſhed while ſhe liſtened to the length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening notes, aſſuaged the force of grief.</p>
                     <p>When the ſervice concluded ſhe withdrew to the parlour of the lady Abbeſs, who mingled with her conſolations many entreaties that Ellena would make the convent her preſent aſylum; and her affliction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired little perſuaſion on this ſubject. It was her wiſh to retire hither as to a ſanctuary, which was not only ſuitable to her particular circumſtances, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially adapted to the preſent ſtate of her ſpirits. Here
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:032735_0082_0FF493E160CB4B50"/>
ſhe believed that ſhe ſhould ſooner acquire reſignation and regain tranquility, than in a place leſs conſecrated to religion; and, before ſhe took leave of the Abbeſs it was agreed, that ſhe ſhould be received as a boarder. To acquaint Vivaldi with her intention was, indeed, her chief motive for returning to the villa Altieri, after this her reſolution had been taken. Her affection and eſteem had been gradual in their progreſs, and had now attained a degree of ſtrength, which promiſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the happineſs or miſery of her whole life. The fanction given by her aunt to this choice, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the very ſolemn manner in which, on the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preceding her death, ſhe bequeathed Ellena to his care, had ſtill endeared him to her heart, and imparted a ſacredneſs to the engagement, which made her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Vivaldi as her guardian and only ſurviving pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector. The more tenderly ſhe lamented her deceaſed relative, the more tenderly ſhe thought of Vivaldi; and her love for the one was ſo intimately connected with her affection for the other, that each ſeemed ſtrengthened and exalted by the union.</p>
                     <p>When the funeral was over, they met at Altieri.</p>
                     <p>He was neither ſurpriſed nor averſe to her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing awhile to a convert; for there was a propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in retiring, during the period of her grief, from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> home where ſhe had no longer a guardian, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy ſeemed to demand. He only ſtipulated that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Notwithſtanding that he yielded to this arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without complaining, it was not entirely without repining; but being aſſured by Ellena of the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Abbeſs of the Santa Maria della Pieta, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Mean while, the deep impreſſion made by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tormentor, the monk, and eſpecially by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the death of Bianchi, remained upon his mind, and he once more determined to aſcertain, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the true nature of this portentous viſitant, and what were the motives which induced him to haunt his footſteps and interrupt his peace. He was awed by the circumſtances which had attended the viſitations of the monk, if monk it was; by the ſuddenneſs of his appearance, and departure; by the truth of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies; and, above all, by the ſolemn event which had verified his laſt warning; and his imagination, thus elevated by wonder and painful curioſity, was prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſomething above the reach of common conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and beyond the accompliſhment of human agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. His underſtanding was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſufficiently clear and ſtrong to teach him to detect many errors of opinion, that prevailed around him, as well as to diſpiſe the common ſuperſtitions of his country, and, in the uſual ſtate of his mind, he probably would not have pauſed for a moment on the ſubject before him; but his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were now intereſted and his fancy awakened, and, though he was unconſcious of this propenſity, he would, perhaps, have been ſomewhat diſappointed to have deſcended ſuddenly from the region of fearful ſublimity, to which he had ſoared—to the world of terrible ſhadows—to the earth, on which he daily walked, and to an explanation ſimply natural.</p>
                     <p>He deſigned to viſit again, at midnight, the fortreſs of Paluzzi, and not to watch for the appearance of the ſtranger, but to carry torches into every receſs of the ruin, and diſcover, at leaſt, whether it was haunted by any other human beings than himſelf. The chief difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which had hitherto delayed him, was that of finding a perſon, in whom he could confide, to accompany him in the ſearch, ſince his former adventure had warned him never to renew it alone. Signor Bonarmo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:032735_0084_0FF493ECC2D94368"/>
abſolutely, and, perhaps, wiſely, to refuſe his requeſt on this ſubject; and, as Vivaldi had no other acquaintance, to whom he choſe to give ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the affair as might induce compliance, he at length determined to take with him Paulo, his own ſervant.</p>
                     <p>On the Evening, previous to the day of Ellena's departure to the Santo della Pieta, Vivaldi went to Altieri, to bid her adieu. During this interview his ſpirits were more than uſually depreſſed; and, though he knew that her retirement was only for a ſhort period, and had as much confidence in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of her affection, as is, perhaps, poſſible to a lover, Vivaldi felt as if he was parting with her for ever. A thouſand vague and fearful conjectures, ſuch as he never till this moment admitted, aſſailed him, and amongſt them, it appeared probable, that the arts of the nuns might win her from the world, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice her to the cloiſter. In her preſent ſtate of ſorrow this ſeemed to be even more than probable, and not all the aſſurances which Ellena gave him, and in theſe parting moments ſhe ſpoke with leſs reſerve than ſhe had hitherto done, could entirely re-aſſure his mind. "It ſhould ſeem, Ellena, by theſe boding fears," ſaid he, imprudently, "that I am parting with you for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; I feel a weight upon my heart, which I cannot throw off. Yet I conſent that you ſhall withdraw awhile to this convent, convinced of the propriety of the ſtep; and I ought, alſo, to know that you will ſoon return; that I ſhall ſoon take you from its walls as my wife, never more to leave me, never more to paſs from my immediate care and tenderneſs. I ought to feel aſſured of all this; yet ſo apt are my fears, that I cannot confide in what is probable, but rather ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what is poſſible. And is it then poſſible that I yet may loſe you, and is it only probable that you may be mine for ever? How under ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:032735_0085_0FF49446A3095858"/>
could I weakly conſent to your retirement? Why did I not urge you to beſtow immediately thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble bonds, which no human force can burſt aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? How could I leave the deſtiny of all my peace within the reach of a poſſibility, which it was once in my power to have removed! Which it was in my power!—It is, perhaps, ſtill in my power. O Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na! let the ſeverities of cuſtom yield to the ſecurity of my happineſs. If you do go to the Santa Maria, let it be only to viſit its altar!"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi delivered this expoſtulation with a rapidity, that left no pauſe for Ellena to interrupt him. When, at length, he concluded, ſhe gently reproached him for doubting the continuance of her regard, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſooth his apprehenſions of misforune, but would not liſten to his requeſt. She repreſented, that not only the ſtate of her ſpirits required retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that reſpect to the memory of her aunt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it; and added gravely, that if he had ſo little confidence in the ſteadineſs of her opinions, as to doubt the conſtancy of her affection, and for ſo ſhort a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, unleſs her vows were ſecured to him, he had done imprudently to elect her for the companion of his whole life.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, then aſhamed of the weakneſs he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, beſought her forgiveneſs, and endeavoured to appeaſe apprehenſions which paſſion only made plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and which reaſon reproved; notwithſtanding which, he could recover neither tranquility nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence; nor could Ellena, though her conduct was ſupported and encouraged by juſtneſs of ſentiment, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely remove the oppreſſion of ſpirits ſhe had felt from almoſt the firſt moment of this interview. They parted with many tears; and Vivaldi, before he final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took his leave, frequently returned to claim ſome promiſe, or to aſcertain ſome explanation, till Ellena remarked with a forced ſmile, that the ſereſembled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:032735_0086_0FF493EE49A97708"/>
adieus, rather than thoſe of only a few days; an obſervation which renewed all his alarm, and furniſhed an excuſe for again delaying his departure. At length he tore himſelf away, and left the villa Altieri; but as the time was yet too early to ſuit his purpoſed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry at Paluzzi, he returned to Naples.</p>
                     <p>Ellena, meanwhile, endeavouring to diſſipate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy recollections by employment, continued bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in preparation for her departure on the following day, till a late hour of the night. In the proſpect of quitting, though only for ſo ſhort a period, the home where ſhe had paſſed almoſt every day ſince the dawn of her earlieſt remembrance, there was ſomething mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy, if not ſolemn in leaving thoſe well-known ſcenes, where, it might be ſaid, the ſhade of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed relative ſeemed yet to linger, ſhe was quitting all veſtige of her late happineſs, all note of former years and preſent conſolation; and ſhe felt as if going forth into a new and homeleſs world. Her affection for the place encreaſed as the paſſing time diminiſhed, and it ſeemed as if the laſt moment of her ſtay would be preciſely that, in which the villa Altieri would be moſt valued.</p>
                     <p>In her favourite apartments ſhe lingered for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time; and in the room where ſhe had ſupped on the night immediately preceding the death of Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora Bianchi, ſhe indulged many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ender and mournful recollections, and probably would have continued to indulge them much longer, had not her attention been withdrawn by a ſudden ruſtling of the foliage that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the window, when on raiſing her eyes, ſhe thought ſhe perceived ſome perſon paſs quickly before it. The lattices had, as uſual, been left open to admit the freſh breeze from the bay below, but ſhe now roſe with ſome alarm to cloſe them, and had ſcarcely done ſo when ſhe heard a diſtant knocking from the portico,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:032735_0087_0FF494482D2A2628"/>
and in the next inſtant the ſcreams of Beatrice in the hall.</p>
                     <p>Alarmed for herſelf, Ellena, had, however, the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to advance to the aſſiſtance of her old ſervant, when, on entering the paſſage leading to the hall, three men, maſked and muffled up in cloaks, appeared, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing from the oppoſite extremity. While ſhe fled, they purſued her to the apartment ſhe had quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Her breath and her courage were gone, yet ſhe ſtruggled to ſuſtain herſelf, and endeavoured to aſk with calmneſs what was their errand. They gave no reply, but threw a veil over her face, and ſeizing her arms, led her almoſt unreſiſting but ſupplicating, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the portico.</p>
                     <p>In the hall, Ellena perceived Beatrice bound to a pillar; and another ruffian, who was alſo maſked, watching over and menacing her, not by words but geſtures. Ellena's ſhrieks ſeemed to recall the almoſt lifeleſs Beatrice, for whom ſhe ſupplicated as much as for herſelf; but entreaty was alike unavailing for each, and Ellena was borne from the houſe and through the garden. All conſciouſneſs had now forſaken her. On recovering, ſhe perceived herſelf in a carriage which was driven with great rapidity, and that her arms were within the graſp of ſome perſons, whom, when her recollection returned more fully, ſhe believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the men, who had carried her from the villa. The darkneſs prevented her from obſerving their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and to all her queſtions and entreaties a death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſilence was obſerved.</p>
                     <p>During the whole night the carriage proceeded ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly, ſtopping only while the ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſes were changed, when Ellena endeavoured to intereſt by her cries the compaſſion of the people at the poſt-houſes, and by her cries only, for the blinds were cloſely drawn. The poſtillions, no doubt impoſed on the credulity of theſe people, for they were inſenſible to her diſtreſs, and her
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:032735_0088_0FF493EFCF9CA0B8"/>
immediate companions ſoon overcame the only means that had remained by which ſhe could make it known.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt hours, a tumult of terror and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment occupied her mind, but, as this began to ſubſide, and her underſtanding to recover its clearneſs, grief and deſpondency mingled with her fears. She ſaw herſelf ſeparated from Vivaldi, probably for ever, for ſhe apprehended that the ſtrong and inviſible hand which governed her courſe, would never relinquiſh its graſp till it had placed her irrecoverably beyond the reach of her lover. A conviction that ſhe ſhould ſee him no more, came, at intervals with ſuch over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming force, that every conſideration and emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſappeared before it; and at theſe moments ſhe loſt all anxiety as to the place of her deſtination, and all fear as to her perſonal ſafety.</p>
                     <p>As the morning advanced and the heat encreaſed, the blinds were let down a little to admit air, and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena then perceived, that only two of the men, who had appeared at the villa Altieri, were in the carriage, and that they were ſtill diſguiſed in cloaks and viſors. She had no means of judging through what part of the country ſhe was travelling, for above the ſmall open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which the blinds left ſhe could ſee only the tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tops of mountains, or ſometimes the veiny preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices and tangled thickets, that cloſely impended over the road,</p>
                     <p>About noon, as ſhe judged from the exceſſive heat, the carriage ſtopped at a poſt-houſe, and ice-water was handed through the window, when, as the blind was lowered to admit it, ſhe perceived herſelf on a wild and ſolatary plain, ſurrounded by mountains and woods. The people at the door of the poſt-houſe ſeemed "unuſed to pity or be pitied." The lean and ſallow countenance of poverty ſtared over their gaunt bones, and habitual diſcontent had fixed the furrows of their cheeks. They regarded Ellena with only a
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:032735_0089_0FF49449B2E845B8"/>
feeble curioſity, though the affliction in her looks might have intereſted almoſt any heart that was not corroded by its own ſufferings; nor did the maſked faces of her companions excite a much ſtronger atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Ellena accepted the cool refreſhment offered her, the firſt ſhe had taken on the road. Her companions having emptied their glaſſes drew up the blind, and, notwithſtanding the almoſt intolerable heat of noon, the carriage proceeded. Fainting under its oppreſſion, Ellena entreated that the windows might he open, when the men, in compliance with their own neceſſity rather than with her requeſt, lowered the blinds, and ſhe had a glimpſe of the lofty region of the mountains, but of no object that could direct her conjecture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning where ſhe was. She ſaw only pinnacles and vaſt precipices of various-tinted marbles, intermingled with ſcanty vegetation, ſuch as ſtunted pinaſters, dwarf oak and holly, which gave dark touches to the many-coloured cliffs, and ſometimes ſtretched in ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy maſſes to the deep vallies, that, winding into ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, ſeemed to invite curioſity to explore the ſcenes beyond. Below theſe bold precipices extended the gloomy regions of olive-trees, and lower ſtill other rocky ſteeps ſunk towards the plains, bearing terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces crowned with vines, and were often the artificial ſoil was propped by thickets of juniper, pomegranates and oleander.</p>
                     <p>Ellena, after having been ſo long ſhut in darkneſs, and brooding over her own alarming circumſtances found temporary, though feeble, relief in once more looking upon the face of nature; till, her ſpirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gradually revived and elevated by the grandeur of the images around her, ſhe ſaid to herſelf, "If I am condemned to miſery, ſurely I could endure it with more fortitude it ſcenes like theſe, than amidſt the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer landſcapes of nature! Here, the objects ſeem to
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:032735_0090_0FF493F15627A950"/>
impart ſomewhat of their own ſublimity, to the ſoul. It is ſcarcely poſſible to yield to the preſſure of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes while we walk, as with the Deity, amidſt his moſt ſtupendous works!"</p>
                     <p>But ſoon after the idea of Vivaldi glancing athwart her memory, ſhe melted into tears; the weakneſs however was momentary, and during the reſt of the journey ſhe preſerved a ſtrenuous equality of mind.</p>
                     <p>It was when the heat and the light were declining that the carriage entered a rocky defile, which ſhewed, as through a telleſcope reverſed diſtant plains, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains opening beyond, lighted up with all the purple ſplendor of the ſetting ſun. Along this deep and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy perſpective a river, which was ſeen deſcending among the cliffs of a mountain, rolled with impetuous force, fretting and foaming amidſt the dark rocks in its deſcent, and then flowing in a limpid lapſe to the brink of other precipices, whence again it fell with thundering ſtrength to the abyſs, throwing its miſty clouds of ſpray high in the air, and ſeeming to claim the ſole empire of this ſolitary wild. Its bed took up the whole breadth of the chaſm, which ſome ſtrong convulſion of the earth ſeemed to have formed, not leaving ſpace even for a road along its margin. The road, therefore, was carried high among the cliffs, that impended over the river, and ſeemed as if ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the air; while the gloom and vaſtneſs of the precipices, which towered above and ſunk below it, together with the amazing force and uproar of the falling waters combined to render the paſs more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic than the pencil could deſcribe, or language can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. Ellena aſcended it, not with indifference but with calmneſs; ſhe experienced ſomewhat of a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pleaſure in looking down upon the irreſiſtible flood; but this emotion was heightened into awe, when ſhe perceived that the road led to a ſlight bridge,
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:032735_0091_0FF49454152F33D8"/>
which, thrown acroſs the chaſm at an immenſe height, united two oppoſite cliffs, between which the whole cataract of the river deſcended. The bridge, which was defended only by a ſlender railing, appeared as if hung amidſt the clouds. Ellena, while ſhe was croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it, almoſt forgot her misfortunes. Having reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the oppoſite ſide of the glen, the road gradually deſcended the precipices for about half a mile, when it opened to extenſive proſpects over plains and towards diſtant mountains—the ſunſhine landſcape, which had long appeared to bound this ſhadowy paſs. The tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition was as the paſſage through the vale of death to the bliſs of eternity; but the idea of its reſemblance did not long remain with Ellena. Perched high a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the cliffs of a mountain, which might be ſaid to terminate one of the jaws of this terific gorge, and which was one of the loftieſt of a chain that ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the plains, appeared the ſpires and long terraces of a monaſtry; and ſhe ſoon underſtood that her journey was to conclude there,</p>
                     <p>At the foot of this mountain her companions alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and obliged her to do the ſame, for the aſcent was too ſteep and irregular to admit of a carriage. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena followed unreſiſtingly, like a lamb to the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, up a path that wound among the rocks, and was coolly over-ſhadowed by thickets of almond trees, figs broad-leaved myrtle, and ever-green roſe buſhes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled with the ſtrawberry tree, beautiful in fruit and bloſſoms, the yellow jaſemine, the delightful <hi>aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia mimoſa,</hi> and a variety of other fragrant plants. Theſe bowers frequently admitted glimpſes of the glowing country below, and ſometimes opened to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſive views bounded by the ſnowy mountains of Abruzzo. At every ſtep were objects which would have afforded pleaſure to a tranquil mind; the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully varigated marbles, that formed the cliffs imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately above, their fractured maſſes emboſſed with
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:032735_0092_0FF493FC645DAD58"/>
moſſes and flowers of every vivid hue that paints the rainbow; the elegance of the ſhrubs that tufted, and the majeſtic grace of the palms which waved over them would have charmed almoſt any other eye than Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's, whoſe ſpirit was rapt in care or than thoſe of her companions, whoſe hearts were dead to feeling. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial features of the vaſt edifice ſhe was approaching, appeared now and then between the trees; the tall weſt window of the cathedral with the ſpires that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topped it; the narrow pointed roofs of the cloiſters; angles of the inſurmountable walls, which fenced the garden from the precipices below, and the dark portal leading into the chief court; each of theſe, ſeen at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals beneath the gloom of cypreſs and ſpreading cedar, ſeemed as if manacing the unhappy Ellena with hints of future ſuffering. She paſt ſeveral ſhrines and images half hid among the ſhrubs and the cliffs; and, when ſhe drew near the monaſtery, her companions ſtopped at a little chapel which ſtood beſide the path, where, after examining ſome papers, an act which ſhe obſerved with ſurpriſe, they drew aſide, as if to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult reſpecting herſelf. Their converſation was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in voices ſo low, that ſhe could not catch a ſingle tone diſtinctly, and it is probable that if ſhe could, this would not have aſſiſted her in conjecturing who they were; yet the pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ound ſilence they had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto obſerved had much encreaſed her curioſity, now that they ſpoke.</p>
                     <p>One of them ſoon after quitted the chapel, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded alone to the monaſtery, leaving Ellena in the cuſtody of his comrade, whoſe pity ſhe now made a laſt, though almoſt hopeleſs, effort to intereſt. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to all her entreaties only by a waving of the hand and an averted face; and ſhe endeavoured to meet with fortitude and to endure with patience, the evil which ſhe could neither avoid nor ſubdue. The ſpot where ſhe awaited the return of the ruffian, was not of a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:032735_0093_0FF494559B8FB9A0"/>
to promote melancholy, except, indeed, that lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urious ſolemn kind of melancholy, which a view of ſtupendous objects inſpires. It overlooked the whole, extent of plains, of which ſhe had before caught partia ſcenes, with the vaſt chain of mountains, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to form an inſurmountable rampart to the rich land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape at their feet. There towering and fantaſtical ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, crowding together into duſky air, like flames ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering to apoint, exhibited images of peculiar grandeur, which each minuter line and feature withdrawing, at this evening hour from obſervation, ſeemed to reſolve itſelf into the more gigantic maſſes, to which the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious tint, the ſolemn obſcurity, that began to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over them, gave force and loftier character. The ſilence and deep repoſe of the landſcape, ſerved to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs this character more awfully on the heart, and while Ellena ſat rapt in the thoughtfulneſs it promoted, the veſper-ſervice of the monks breathing ſoftly from the cathedral above, came to her ear; it was a muſic which might be ſaid to win on ſilence, and was in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect uniſon with her feelings; ſolemn, deep, and full, it ſwelled in holy peals, and rolled away in murmurs, which attention purſued to the laſt faint note that melted into air. Ellena's heart owned the power of its high minſtrelſy; and while ſhe caught for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſweeter voices of the nuns mingling in the chorus, ſhe iudulged a hope that they would not be wholly inſenſible to her ſufferings, and that ſhe ſhould receive ſome conſolation from ſympathy as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oft as theſe tender-breathing ſtrains appeared to indicate.</p>
                     <p>She had reſted nearly half an hour on the turfy ſlope before the chapel, when ſhe perceived thro' the twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, two monks deſcending from the monaſtery to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſpot where ſhe ſat. As they drew near, ſhe diſtinguiſhed their dreſs of grey ſtuff, the hood, the ſhaven head, where only a coronet of white hair was left, and other enſigns of their particular Order. On
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:032735_0094_0FF493FDE9C000E8"/>
reaching the chapel they accoſted her companion, with whom they retired a few paces, and converſed. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena heard, for the firſt time the ſound of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor's voice, and though this was but faintly, ſhe marked it well. The other ruffian did not appear, but it ſeemed evident that theſe friars had left the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in conſequence of his information; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when ſhe looked upon the taller of the two, ſhe fancied ſhe ſaw the perſon of the very man whoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſhe had remarked, a conjecture which ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened while ſhe more accurately noticed him. The portrait had certainly much reſemblance in height and bulk; and the ſame gaunt awkwardneſs, which even the cloak of the ruffian had not entirely ſhrouded, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded itſelf from under the folded garments of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſe. If countenance, too, might be truſted, this ſame friar had a ruffian's heart, and his keen and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eye ſeemed habitually upon the watch for prey. His brother of the order ſhewed nothing ſtrongly characteriſtic either in his face or manner.</p>
                     <p>After a private converſation of ſome length, the fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars approached Ellena, and told her, that ſhe muſt accompany them to the convent; when her diſguiſed conductor, having reſigned her to them, immediately departed and deſcended the mountain.</p>
                     <p>Not a word was uttered by either of the party as they purſued the deep tract leading to the gates of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded edifice, which were opened to them by a lay-brother, and Ellena entered a ſpacious court. Three ſides of this were cloſed by lofty buildings, lined with ranges of cloiſters; the fourth opened to a garden, ſhaded with avenues of melancholy cypreſs, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the cathedral, whoſe fretted windows and ornamented ſpires appeared to cloſe the perſpective. Other large and detached buildings ſkirted the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens on the left, while, on the right, ſpacious olive grounds and vineyards ſpread to the cliffs that formed
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:032735_0095_0FF4945723071250"/>
a barrier to all this ſide of the domain of the convent.</p>
                     <p>The friar, her conductor, croſſed the court to the north wing, and there ringing a bell a door was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a nun, into whoſe hands Ellena was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. A ſignificant look was exchanged between the devotees, but no words; the friar departed, and the nun, ſtill ſilent, conducted her through many ſolitary paſſages, where not even a diſtant foot-fall echoed, and whoſe walls were roughly painted with ſubjects indicatory of the ſevere ſuperſtitions of the place, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to inſpire melancholy awe. Ellena's hope of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vaniſhed as her eyes glanced over theſe ſymbols of the diſpoſition of the inhabitants, and on the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the nun characteriſed by a gloomy malignity, which ſeemed ready to inflict upon others ſome porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the unhappineſs ſhe herſelf ſuffered. As ſhe glided forward with ſoundleſs ſtep, her white drapery, floating along theſe ſolemn avenues, and her hollow features touched with the mingled light and ſhadow which the partial rays of a taper ſhe held occaſioned, ſhe ſeemed like a ſpectre newly riſen from the grave, rather than a living being. Theſe paſſages ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in the parlour of the Abbeſs, where the nun pauſed, and turning to Ellena, ſaid, "It is the hour of veſpers; you will wait here till our lady of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent leaves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the church; ſhe would ſpeak with you."</p>
                     <p>"To what ſaint is the convent dedicated," ſaid El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena, "and who, ſiſter, preſides over it?</p>
                     <p>The nun gave no reply, and after having eyed the forlorn ſtranger for a moment, with inquiſitive ill-nature, quitted the room. The unhappy Ellena had not been le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This Abbeſs, who was herſelf a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of ſome diſtinction, believed that of all poſſible
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:032735_0096_0FF493FF71185FE8"/>
crimes, next to that of ſacrilege, offences againſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of rank were leaſt pardonable. It is not ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, therefore, that ſuppoſing, Ellena a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of no family, to have ſought clandeſtinely to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite herſelf with the noble houſe of Vivaldi, ſhould feel for her, not only diſdain, but indignation, and that ſhe ſhould readily conſent, not only to puniſh the offender, but at the ſame time, to afford means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ancient dignity of the offended.</p>
                     <p>"I underſtand," ſaid the Abbeſs, on whoſe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance the alarmed Ellena had ariſen, "I underſtand," ſaid ſhe, without making any ſignal for her to be ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "that you are the young perſon who is arrived from Naples,"</p>
                     <p>"My name is Ellena di Roſalba," ſaid her auditor, recovering ſome degree of courage from the manner which was deſigned to depreſs her.</p>
                     <p>"I know nothing of your name," replied the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior; "I am informed only that you are ſent here to acquire a knowledge of yourſelf and of your duties. Till the period ſhall be paſſed, for which you are given into my charge, I ſhall ſcrupulouſly obſerve the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of the troubleſome office, which my regard for the honor of a noble family, has induced me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake."</p>
                     <p>By theſe words, the author and the motives of this extraordinary tranſaction were at once revealed to El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena, who was for ſome moments almoſt overwhelmed by the ſudden horrors that gathered in her mind, and ſtood ſilent and motionleſs. Fear, ſhame, indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, alternately aſſailed her; and the ſting of offended honor, on being ſuſpected, and thus accuſed of having voluntarily diſturbed the tranquility, and ſought the alliance of any family, and eſpecially of one who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained her, ſtruck forcibly to her heart, till the pride of conſcious worth revived her courage and fortified her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The Abbeſs, unaccuſtomed to have her power op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, or her words queſtioned, was for a moment too indignant to reply; and Ellena obſerved, but no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with diſmay, the brooding tempeſt ready to burſt over her head. "It is I only who am injured," ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "and ſhall the guilty oppreſſor triumph, and the innocent ſufferer ſink under the ſhame that belongs only to guilt! Never will I yield to a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo contemptible. The conſciouſneſs of deſerving well, will recall my preſence of mind, which permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me to eſtimate the characters of my oppreſſors by their actions, will enable me alſo to diſpiſe their power."</p>
                     <p>"I muſt remind you," ſaid the Abbeſs, at length, "that the queſtions you make are unbecoming in your ſituation; and that contrition and humility are the beſt extenuations of error. You may withdraw."</p>
                     <p>"Moſt true," replied Ellena, bowing with digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Superior; "and I moſt willingly reſign them to my oppreſſors."</p>
                     <p>Ellena forebore to make further<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> enquiry or remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, and perceiving that reproach would not only be uſeleſs, but degrading to herſelf, ſhe immediately obeyed the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>ate of the Abbeſs, and determined ſince ſhe muſt ſuffer, to ſuffer if poſſible, with firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and dignity.</p>
                     <p>She was conducted from the parlour by the nun who had admitted her, and as ſhe paſſed through the refactory where the nuns, juſt returned from veſpers, were aſſembled, their inquiſitive glances, their ſmiles and buſy whiſpers, told her, that ſhe was not only an object of curioſity, but of ſuſpicion, and that little ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy could be expected from hearts, which even the offices of hourly devotion had not purified from the
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:032735_0098_0FF46F201A8060C8"/>
malignant envy, that taught them to exalt themſelves upon the humiliation of others.</p>
                     <p>The little room to which Ellena was led, and where, to her great ſatisfaction, ſhe was left alone, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſerved the denomination of a cell than of a chamber; ſince, like thoſe of the nuns, it had only one ſmall lattice; and a mattreſs, one chair, and a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with a prayer-book were all its furniture. Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, as ſhe ſurveyed her melancholy habitation, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a riſing ſigh, but ſhe could not remain unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by recollections, which, on this view of her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſtate, crowded to her mind: nor think of Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di far away, perhaps for ever, and probably, even ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of her diſtination, without bitter tears. But ſhe dried them, as the idea of the Marcheſa obtruded on her thoughts, for other emotions than thoſe of grief poſſeſſed her. It was to the Marcheſa that ſhe eſpecially attributed her preſent ſituation; and it now appeared that the family of Vivaldi had not only been reluctant, but abſolutely averſe to a connection with hers, contrary to the ſuggeſtions of Signora Bianchi, who had repreſented, that it might be ſuppoſed only, from their known character, that they would diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the alliance, but would of courſe be reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an event, which their haughtieſt diſpleaſure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could revoke. This diſcovery of their abſolute rejection awakened all the proper pride, which the miſtaken prudence of her aunt, and her affection for Vivaldi had lulled to reſt; and ſhe now ſuffered the moſt acute vexation and remorſe, for having yielded her conſent to enter clandeſtinely into any family. The imaginary honors of ſo noble an alliance vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when the terms of obtaining them were conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and now, that the ſound mind of Ellena was left to its own judgment, ſhe looked with infinitely more pride and preference upon the induſtrious means,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:032735_0099_0FF494A64169F810"/>
which had hitherto rendered her independent, than on all diſtinction which might be reluctantly conferred. The conſciouſneſs of innocence, which had ſupported her in the preſence of the Superior, began to falter. "Her accuſation was partly juſt!" ſaid Ellena, "and I deſerve puniſhment, ſince I could even for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſubmit to the humiliation of deſiring an alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which I knew would be unwillingly conferred. But it is not yet too late to retrieve my own eſteem by aſſerting my independence, and reſigning Vivaldi for ever. By reſigning him! by abandoning him who loves me,—abandoning him to miſery! Him, whom I cannot even think of without tears,—to whom my vows have been given,—who may claim me by the ſacred remembrance of my dying friend,—him, to whom my whole heart is devoted! O! miſerable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative!—that I can no longer act juſtly, but at the expence of all my future happineſs! Juſtly! And would it then be juſt to abandon him who is willing to reſign every thing for me,—abandon him to ceaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſorrow, that the prejudices of his family may be gratified?"</p>
                     <p>Poor Ellena perceived that ſhe could not obey the dictates of a juſt pride, without ſuch oppoſition from her heart as ſhe had never experienced before. Her affections were now too deeply engaged to permit her to act with firmneſs, at the price of long-ſuffering. The conſideration of reſigning Vivaldi was ſo very grievous, that ſhe could ſcarcely endure to pauſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it for a moment; yet, on the other hand, when ſhe thought of his family, it appeared that ſhe never could conſent to make a part of it. She would have blamed the eroneous judgment of Signora Bianchi, whoſe perſuaſions had ſo much aſſiſted in reducing her to the preſent alternative, had not the tenderneſs with which ſhe cheriſhed her memory, rendered this impoſſible. All, that now remained for her, was to endeavour pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:032735_0100_0FF46F232A96FC10"/>
to endure preſent evils which ſhe could not conquer; for, to forſake Vivaldi as the price of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhould liberty be offered her on ſuch terms, or to accept him in defiance of honorable pride, ſhould he ever affect her releaſe, appeared to her diſtracted thoughts almoſt equally impracticable But, as the probability of never being able to diſcover her abode, returned to her conſideration, the anguiſh ſhe ſuffered told how much more ſhe dreaded to loſe then to accept Vivaldi, and that love was, after all, the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful affection of her heart.</p>

                     <p>VIVALDI, meanwhile, ignorant of what had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred at the villa Altieri, repaired as he had propoſed to Paluzzi, attended hy his ſervant Paulo. It was deep night before he left Naples, and ſo anxious was he to conceal himſelf from obſervation, that though Paulo carried a torch, he did not permit it to be lighted, till after he ſhould have remained ſome time within the arch-way, thinking it moſt prudent to watch awhile in ſecret for his unknown adviſer, before he proceeded to examine the fort.</p>
                     <p>His attendant, Paulo, was a true Neapolitian, ſhrewd, inquiſitive, inſinuating, adroit; poſſeſſing much of the ſpirit of intrigue, together with a conſiderable portion of humour, which diſplayed itſelf not ſo much in words, as in his manner and countenance, in the archneſs of his dark, penetrating eye, and in the exquiſite adapta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his geſture to his idea. He was a diſtinguiſhed favourite of his maſter, who, if he had not humour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, had a keen reliſh for it in others, and who certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did poſſeſs wit, with all its lively accompaniments, in an eminent degree. Vivaldi had been won by the <hi>naivete</hi> and humour of this man, to allow him an unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual degree of familiarity in converſation; and, as they now walked together towards Paluzzi, he unfolded to Paulo as much of his former adventure there as he judged neceſſary to intereſt his curioſity and excite his vigilance. The relation did both. Paulo, however, naturally courageous, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ncredulous to ſuperſtition of any kind; and having quickly perceived that his maſter was not altogether indiſpoſed to attribute to a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſe the extraordinary occurrences at paluzzi, he
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:032735_0102_0FF46F24DB1CDF48"/>
began, in his manner, to rally him; but Vivaldi was not in temper to endure jeſting; his mood was grave, even to ſolemnity, and he yeilded, though reluctantly, to the awe which, at intervails, returned upon him with the force of a magical ſpell, binding up all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to ſternneſs, and fixing them in expectation. While he was nearly regardleſs of defence againſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man agency, his ſervant was, however, preparing for that alone; and very properly repreſented the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of going to Paluzzi in darkneſs. Vivaldi ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that they could not watch for the monk other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than in darkneſs. ſince the torch which lighted them would alſo warn him, and he had very particular reaſons for watching before he proceeded to examine. He added, that after a certain time had elapſed, the torch might be lighted at a neighbouring cottage. Paulo objected, that in the meanwhile, the perſon for whom they watched might eſcape; and Vivaldi com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſed the affair. The torch was lighted but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed within a hollow of the cliffs, that bordered on the road, and the centinels took their ſtation in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, within the deep arch, near the ſpot where Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di had watched with Bonarmo. As they did this, the diſtant chime of a convent informed Vivaldi that mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night was turned. The ſound recalled to his mind the the words of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, concerning the vicinity of the convent of the <hi>Black Penitents,</hi> to Paluzzi, and he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Paulo whether this was the chime of that convent. Paulo replied that it was, and that a remarkable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance had taught him to remember <hi>the Santa del Pianto,</hi> or <hi>our Lady of Tears.</hi> "The place, Signor, would intereſt you," ſaid Paulo for there are ſome-odd ſtories told of it; and I am inclined <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o think, this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known monk muſt be one of that ſociety, his conduct is ſo ſtrange."</p>
                     <p>"You believe then, that I am willing to give faith to wonderful ſtories," ſaid Vivaldi, ſmiling.</p>
                     <p>"But what have you heard, that is ſo extraordinary,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:032735_0103_0FF46EB36468EC40"/>
reſpecting this convent? Speak low, or we may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered."</p>
                     <p>"Why, Signor, the ſtory is not generally known," ſaid Paulo in a whiſper; "I half promiſed never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal it."</p>
                     <p>"If you are under any promiſe of ſecreſy," interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Vivaldi, "I forbid you to tell this wonderful tale, which, however, ſeems ſomewhat too bad to reſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your brain."</p>
                     <p>"The ſtory would fain expand itſelf to your's Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor," ſaid Paulo; "and, as I did not abſolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to conceal it, I am very willing to reveal it."</p>
                     <p>"Proceed, then," ſaid Vivaldi; "but l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t me once more caution you to ſpeak low."</p>
                     <p>"You are obeyed, Signor. You muſt know then, <hi>Maeſtro,</hi> that it was on the eve of the feſtival of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Marco</hi> and about ſix years ſince."—</p>
                     <p>"Peace!" ſaid Vivaldi. They were ſilent; but every thing remaining ſtill, Paulo, after ſome time ventured to proceed, though in a yet ſlower whiſper. "It was on the eve of the <hi>Santo Marco,</hi> and when the laſt bell had rung, that a perſon"—He ſtopped again, for a ruſtling ſound paſſed near him.</p>
                     <p>"You are too late," ſaid a ſudden voice beſide Vivaldi, who inſtantly recognized the thrilling accents of the monk.—"It is paſt midnight; ſhe departed an hour ago. Look to your ſteps!"</p>
                     <p>Though thrilled by this well known voice, Vivaldi ſcarcely yielded to his feelings for a moment, but, chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the queſtion which would have aſked "who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted?" he, by a ſudden ſpring, endeavoured to ſieze the intruder, while Paulo, in the firſt hurry of his alarm fired a piſtol, and then haſtened for the torch. So cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly did Vivaldi beleive himſelf to have leaped upon the ſpot whence the voice proceeded, that, on reaching it, he inſtantly extended his arms and ſearching around expected every moment to find his enemy in his graſp.</p>
                     <p>Darkneſs again bafled his attempt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

"You are known," cried Vivaldi; "you ſhall ſee me at the <hi>Santa del Pianto!</hi> What, oh! Paulo, the torch!—the torch!"</p>
                     <p>Paulo, ſwift as the wind, appeared with it. "He paſſed up thoſe ſteps in the rock, Signor; I ſaw the ſkirts of his garments aſcending!"</p>
                     <p>"Follow me, then," ſaid Vivaldi, mounting the ſteps. "Away, away, <hi>Maeſtro!"</hi> ſaid Paulo, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently; "but for Heaven's ſake, name no more the convent of the <hi>Santa del Pianto;</hi> our lives may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it!"</p>
                     <p>He followed to the terrace above, where Vivaldi, holding high the torch, looked round for the monk. The place, however, as far as his eye could penetrate, was forſaken and ſilent. The glare of the torch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened only the rude walls of the citadel, ſome points of the cliff below, and ſome tall pines that waved over them, leaving in doubtful gloom many a rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Do you perceive any perſon, Paulo?" ſaid Vival di, waving the torch in the air to rouſe the flame.</p>
                     <p>"Among thoſe arches on the left, Signor, thoſe arches that ſtand duſkily beyond the citadel, I thought I ſaw a ſhadowy ſort of a figure paſs.

                     <p>"Fewer words, and more caution!" ſaid Vivaldi, lowering the torch, and pointing it towards the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which Paulo had mentioned, "Be vigilant, and tread lightly."</p>
                     <p>"You are obeyed, Signor; but their eyes will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them, though their ears refuſe, while we hold a light to our ſteps."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="107" facs="unknown:032735_0105_0FF46EB6F7830770"/>
"Peace, with this buffoonery!" ſaid Vivaldi, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſternly; "follow in ſilence, and be on your guard."</p>
                     <p>Paulo ſubmitted and they proceeded towards the range of arches; which communicated with the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whoſe ſingular ſtructure had formerly arreſted the attention of Bonarmo, and whence Vivaldi himſelf had returned with ſuch unexpected precipitancy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation.</p>
                     <p>On perceiving the place he was approaching, he ſuddenly ſtopped and Paulo, obſerving his agitation, and probably not reliſhing the adventure, endeavoured to diſſuade him from further reſearch: "For we know not who may inhabit this gloomy place, Signor, or their numbers, and we are only two of us after all. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Signor, it was through that door, yonder;" and he pointed to the very ſpot whence Vivaldi had ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully iſſued; "through that door, that I fancied juſt now, I ſaw ſomething paſs."</p>
                     <p>"Are you certain as to this?" ſaid Vivaldi, with encreaſed emotion. "What was its form?"</p>
                     <p>"It was ſo duſky thereabout, Maeſtro, that I could not diſtinguiſh."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi's eyes were fixed upon the building, and a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent conflict of feelings ſeemed to ſhake his ſoul. A few ſeconds decided it. "I will go on," ſaid he, "and terminate, at any hazard, this ſtate of intolerable anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety. Paulo, pauſe a moment, and conſider well, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you can depend on your courage, for it may be ſeverely tried. If you can deſcend with me in ſilence, and I warn you to be wary; if you cannot, I will go alone."</p>
                     <p>"It is too late now, Signor, to aſk myſelf that queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion," replied Paulo, with a ſubmiſſive air; "and if I had not ſettled it long ago, I ſhould not have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you thus far. My courage, Signor, you never doubted before."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="108" facs="unknown:032735_0106_0FF46F2C6CEE9040"/>
"Come on then," ſaid Vivaldi. He drew his ſword, and entering the narrow door-way, the torch, which he had now reſigned to Paulo, ſhewed a ſtone paſſage, that was, however, interminable to the eye.</p>
                     <p>As they proceeded, Paulo obſerved that the walls were ſtained in ſeveral places with what appeared to be blood, but prudently forbore to point out this to his maſter, obſerving the ſtrict injunction of ſilence he had received.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi ſtepped cautiouſly, and often pauſed to liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, after which he went on with a quicker pace, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſigns only to Paulo to follow, and be vigilant.—The paſſage terminated in a ſtaircaſe, that ſeemed to lead to vaults below. Vivaldi remembered the light which had formerly appeared there, and, as recollection of the paſt gathered on his mind, he faultered in his purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Again he pauſed, looked back upon Paulo, but was going forward, when Paulo himſelf ſeized his arm.—"Stop! Signor," ſaid he in a low voice. "Do you not diſtinguiſh a figure ſtanding yonder in the gloom?"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi looked onward, and perceived indiſtinctly, ſomething as of human form, but motionleſs and ſilent.</p>
                     <p>It ſtood at the duſky extremity of the avenue, near the ſtair-caſe. Its garments, if garments they were, were dark; but its whole figure was ſo ſaintly traced to the eye, that it was impoſſible to aſcertain whether this was the monk. Vivaldi took the light, and held it forward, endeavouring to diſtinguiſh the object be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ventured further; but the enquiry was uſeleſs, and reſigning the torch to Paulo, he ruſhed on. When he reached the head of the ſtair-caſe, however, the form, whatever it might be, was gone. Vivaldi had heard no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

the chambers below; and, after heſitating a while on the head of the ſtairs, he deſcended.</p>
                     <p>Paulo had not followed down many ſteps, when he called out, "It is there! Signor; I ſee it again! and now again! and now it flits away through the door that opens to the vaults!"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi purſued ſo ſwiftly, that Paulo could ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow faſt enough with the light; and, as at length he reſted to take breath, he perceived himſelf in the ſame ſpacious chamber to which he had formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended. At this moment Paulo perceived his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance change. "You are ill, Signor," ſaid he, "In the name of our holy Saint, let us quit this hideous place. Its inhabitants can be nothing good, and no good can come of our remaining here."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi made no reply; he drew breath with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and his eyes remained fixed on the ground, till a noiſe, like the creaking of a heavy hinge, roſe in a diſtant part of the vault. Paulo turned his eye, at the ſame inſtant, towards the place whence it came, and they both perceived a door in the wall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lowly opened and immediately cloſed again, as if the perſon within had feared to be diſcovered. Each believed, from the tranſient view he had of it, that this was the fame fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure which had appeared on the ſtair-caſe, and that it was the monk himſelf. Reanimated by this belief, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi's nerves were inſtantly r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>braced, and he ſprang to the door, which was unfaſtened and yielded immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to his impetuous hand, "You ſhall not deceive me now," cried he, as he entered; "Paulo! keep guard at the door!"</p>
                     <p>He looked round the ſecond vault, in which he now found himſelf, but no perſon appeared; he examined the place, and particularly the walls, without diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any aperture, either of door or window, by which the figure could have quitted the chamber; a ſtrongly grated caſement, placed near the roof, was all that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

air and probably light. Vivaldi was aſtoniſhed! "Have you ſeen any thing paſs?" ſaid he to Paulo.</p>
                     <p>"Nothing, Maeſtro," replied the ſervant.</p>
                     <p>"This is almoſt incredible," exclaimed, Vivaldi; "'tis certain, this form can be nothing human!"</p>
                     <p>"If ſo, Signor," obſerved Paulo, "why ſhould it fear us? as ſurely it does; or why ſhould it have fled?"</p>
                     <p>"That is not ſo certain," rejoined Vivaldi; "it may have fled only to lead us into evil. But bring hither the torch; here is ſomething in the wall which I would examine."</p>
                     <p>Paulo obeyed. It was merely a ruggedneſs in the ſtones, not the partition of a door, that had excited his curioſity. "This is inexplicable," exclaimed Vivaldi, after a long pauſe. "What motive could any human being have for thus tormenting me?"</p>
                     <p>"Or any being ſuperhuman, either, my Signor?" ſaid Paulo.</p>
                     <p>"I am warned of evils that await me," continued Vivaldi, muſing: "of events that are regularly fulfilled; the being who warms me, croſſes my path perpetually, yet, with the cunning of a demon, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly eludes my graſp, and baffles my purſuit! It is incomprehenſible, by what means he glides thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from my eye, and fades, as if into air, at my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach! He is repeatedly in my preſence, yet is nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be found?"</p>
                     <p>"It is moſt true, Signor," ſaid Paulo, "that he is never to be found, and therefore let me entreat you to give up the purſuit. This place is enough to make one believe in the horrors of purgatory? Let us go, Signor."</p>
                     <p>"What but ſpirit could have quitted this vault ſo myſteriouſly," continued Vivaldi, not attending to Paulo; "what but ſpirit!"—</p>
                     <p>"I would fain prove," ſaid the ſervant, "that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance can quit it as eaſily; I would fain evaporate through that door myſelf."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="111" facs="unknown:032735_0109_0FF46EBC85CE7EF8"/>
He had ſcarcely ſpoken the words, when the door cloſed, with a thundering clap that echoed through all the vaults; and Vivaldi and Paulo ſtood for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aghaſt! and then both haſtened to open it, and to leave the place. Their conſternation may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily conceived, when they found that all their efforts at the door were ineffectual. The thick wood was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid with ſolid bars of iron; and was of ſuch uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable ſtrength, that it evidently guarded what had been deſigned for a priſon, and appeared to be the keep or dungeon of the ancient fort.</p>
                     <p>"Ah, Signor mio!" ſaid Paulo," if this was a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, 'tis plain he knew we were not ſo, by his luring us hither.

                     <p>"Peace, good Signor <hi>Buffo!"</hi> ſaid Vivaldi; "a truce with this nonſenſe, and aſſiſt in ſearching for ſome means of eſcape."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi again examined the walls, and as unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as before; but in one corner of the vault <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ay an object, which ſeemed to tell the fate of one who had been confined here, and to hint his own: it was a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment covered with blood. Vivaldi and his ſervant diſcovered it at the ſame inſtant; and a dreadful fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boding of their own diſtin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> fixed them, for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to the ſpot. Vivaldi firſt recovered himſelf, when inſtead of yielding to deſpondency, all his facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were arouſed to diviſe ſome means for eſcaping; but Paulo's hopes ſeemed buried beneath the dreadful veſtments upon which he ſtill gazed. "Ah, my Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor!" ſaid he, at length, in a faultering accent, "who ſhall dare to raiſe that garment? What if it ſhould conceal the mangled body whoſe blood has ſtained it!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="112" facs="unknown:032735_0110_0FF46F2FA10C76E8"/>
Vivaldi, ſhudderingly, turned to look on it again.</p>
                     <p>"It moves!" exclaimed Paulo; "I ſee it move!" as he ſaid which, he ſtarted to the oppoſite ſide of the chamber. Vivaldi ſtepped a few paces back, and as quickly returned; when, determined to know the event at once, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e raiſed the garment upon the point of his ſword, and perceived, beneath, other remains of dreſs, heaped high together, while even the floor below was ſtained with gore.</p>
                     <p>Believing that fear had deceived the eyes of Paulo, Vivaldi watched this horrible ſpectacle for ſome time, but without perceiving the leaſt motion; when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came convinced, that not any remains of life were ſhrouded beneath it, and that it contained only articles of dreſs, which had belonged to ſome unfortunate perſon, who had probably been decoyed hither for plunder, and afterwards murdered. This belief, and the repugnance he felt to dwell upon the ſpectacle, prevented him from examining further, and he turned away to a remote part of the vault. A conviction of his own fate, and of his ſervant's, filled his mind for a while with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. It appeared that he had been enſnared by rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, till, as he recollected the circumſtances which had attended his entrance, and ſeveral peculiar occurrences connected with the arch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>way, this conjecture ſeemed highly improbable: It was unreaſonable, that robbers ſhould have taken the trouble to decoy, when they might at firſt have ſeized him; ſtill more ſo, that they would have perſevered ſo long in the attempt; and moſt of all, that when he had formerly been in their power, they ſhould have neglected their opportunity, and ſuffered him to leave the ruin unmoleſted. Yet, granting that all this, improbable as it was, were, however, poſſible, the ſolemn warnings and predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the monk, ſo frequently delivered, and ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fulfilled, could have no connection with the ſchemes of banditti. It appeared, therefore, that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:032735_0111_0FF46EBE6B51C860"/>
was not in the hands of robbers; or, if he were, that the monk, at leaſt, had no connection with them; yet it was certain that he had juſt heard the voice of this monk beneath the arch; that his ſervant had ſaid, he ſaw the veſtments of one aſcending the ſteps of the fort; and that they had both reaſon, afterwards, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it was his ſhadowy figure, which they had purſued to the very chamber where they were now confined.</p>
                     <p>As Vivaldi conſidered all theſe circumſtances, his perplexity encreaſed, and he was more than ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe, that the form, which had aſſumed the appearance of a monk, was ſomething ſuper-human.</p>
                     <p>"If this being had <hi>appeared only,"</hi> ſaid he to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, "I ſhould, perhaps, have thought it the perturbed ſpirit of him, who doubtleſs has been murdered here, and that it led me hither to diſcover the deed, that his bones might be removed to holy ground; but this monk, or whatever it is, was neither ſilent, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently anxious concerning himſelf; he ſpoke only of events connected with my peace, and predicted of the future, as well as reverted to the paſt! If he had either hinted of himſelf, or had been wholly ſilent, his appearance, and manner of eluding purſuit, is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, that I ſhould have yielded, for once, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, to the tales of our grandfathers, and thought he was the ſpectre of a murdered perſon."</p>
                     <p>As Vivaldi expreſſed his incredulity, however, he returned to examine the garment once more, when, as he raiſed it, he obſerved, what had before eſcaped his notice, black drapery mingled with the heap beneath; and, on lifting this alſo on the point of his ſword, he perceived part of the habiliment of a monk! He ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the diſcovery, as if he had ſeen the apparition, which had ſo long been tempting his credulity. Here were the veſt and ſcapulary, rent and ſtained with blood! Having gazed for a moment, he let them drop
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:032735_0112_0FF46F3190F045F0"/>
upon the heap; when Paulo, who had been ſilently obſerving him, exclaimed,</p>
                     <p>"Signor! that ſhould be the garment of the demon who led us hither. Is it a winding-ſheet for us, Maeſtro? Or was it one for the body he inhabited while on earth!"</p>
                     <p>"Neither, I truſt," replied Vivaldi, endeavouring to command the perturbation he ſuffered, and turning from the ſpectacle; "therefore we will try once more to regain our liberty."</p>
                     <p>This was a deſign, however, beyond his accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and having again attacked the door, raiſed Paulo to the grated window, and vociferated for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe with his utmoſt ſtrength, in which he was very ably ſeconded by Paulo, he abandoned for the preſent all further attempts, and, weary and deſponding, threw himſelf on the ground of the dungeon.</p>
                     <p>Paulo bitterly lamented his maſter's raſhneſs in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating to this remote ſpot, and bewailed the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of their being famiſhed.</p>
                     <p>"For ſuppoſing, Signor, that we were not decoyed hither for plunder and butchery, and ſuppoſing that we are not ſurrounded by malicious ſpirits, which San Januarius forbid I ſhould take upon me to affirm is impoſſible! ſuppoſing all this, Signor, yet ſtill there remains almoſt a certainty of our being ſtarved to death; for how is it poſſible that any body can hear our cries, in a place ſo remote from all reſort, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, as one may ſay, under ground as this is?"</p>
                     <p>"Thou art an excellent comforter," ſaid Vivaldi, groaning.</p>
                     <p>"You muſt allow, Signor, that you are as excellent a conductor."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi gave no anſwer, but lay on the ground, abandoned to agonizing thought. He had now leiſure to conſider the late words of the monk, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, for he was in a mood for conjecturing the
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:032735_0113_0FF46EC19BFCE6D8"/>
worſt, that they not only alluded to Ellena, but that his ſaying, "ſhe had departed an hour ago," was a figurative manner of telling that ſhe had died then. This was a conjecture which diſpelled almoſt all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion for himſelf. He ſtarted from the ground, and paced his priſon with quick and unequal ſteps; it was now no longer a heavy deſpondency that oppreſſed him, but an acute anxiety that ſtung him, and with the tortures of ſuſpenſe, brought alſo that of paſſionate impatience and horror concerning the fate of Ellena. The longer he dwelt upon the poſſibility of her death, the more probable it appeared. The monk had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy forewarned him of the death of Bianchi; and when he recollected the ſuſpicious circumſtances which had attended it, his terrors for Ellena increaſed. The more he yielded to his feelings, the more violent they became, till at length, his ungovernable impatience and apprehenſions aroſe almoſt to frenzy.</p>
                     <p>Paulo forgot for a while his own ſituation in the ſuperior ſufferings of his maſter, and now, at leaſt endeavoured to perform the offices of a comforter, for he tried to calm Vivaldi's mind, by ſelecting the faireſt circumſtances for hope which the ſubject admitted, and he paſſed without noticing, or, if noticing, only lightly touched upon the moſt prominent poſſibilities of evil. His maſter, however, was inſenſible to all he ſaid, till he mentioned again the convent del Pianto; and this ſubject, as it ſeemed connected with the monk, who had hinted the fate of Ellena, intereſted the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Vivaldi, who withdrew awhile from his own reflection, to liſten to a recital which might aſſiſt his conjectures.</p>
                     <p>Paulo complied with his command, but not without reluctance. He looked round the empty vault, as if he feared that ſome perſon might be lurking in the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, who would overhear and even anſwer him.</p>
                     <p>"We are tolerably retired here too, Signor," ſaid
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:032735_0114_0FF46F35067997C0"/>
he, recollecting himſelf; "one may venture to talk ſecrets with little danger of being diſcovered. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Maeſtro, it is beſt to make matters quite ſure; and therefore, if you will pleaſe to take a ſeat on the ground, I will ſtand beſide you and relate all I know of the convent of <hi>Our Lady of Tears,</hi> which is not much after all."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi having ſeated himſelf, and bidden Paulo do the ſame, the ſervant began in a low voice—"It was on the vigil of the Santo Marco, juſt after the laſt veſper-bell had tolled—You never was at the Santa Maria del Pianto, Signor, or you would know what a gloomy old church it has—It was in a confeſſional in one of the ſide ailes of this church, and juſt after the laſt bell had ceaſed, that a perſon, ſo muffled up that neither ſhape nor face could be diſtinguiſhed, came and placed himſelf on the ſteps of one of the boxes adjoining the confeſſional chair; but if he had been as airily dreſſed as yourſelf, Signor, he might have been juſt as well concealed; for the duſky aile is light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by one lamp, which hangs at the end next the painted window, except when the tapers at the ſhrine of San Antonio happen to be burning at the other extremity, and even then the place is almoſt as gloomy as this vault. But that is, no doubt contrived for the purpoſe, that people may not bluſh for the ſins they confeſs; and in good faith, this is an accommodation which may bring more money to the poors' box, for the monks have a ſhrewd eye that way, and"—</p>
                     <p>"You have dropt the thread of your ſtory," ſaid Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"True, Signor, let me recollect where I loſt it—Oh! at the ſteps of the confeſſional:—the ſtranger knelt down upon them, and for ſome time poured ſuch groans into the ear of the confeſſor, as were heard all along the aile. You are to know, Signor, that the brothers of Santa del Pianto are of the order of Black
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:032735_0115_0FF46EEE7780C168"/>
Penitents; and people who have more than ordinary ſins to confeſs, ſometimes go there, to conſult with the grand penitentiary himſelf, what is to be done. Now it happened that Father Anſaldo, the grand peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary himſelf was in the chair, as is cuſtomary on the vigil of the Santo Marco; and he gently reproved the penitent for bewailing ſo loud, and bade him take comfort; when the other replied only by a groan deeper than before, but it was not ſo loud, and then proceeded to confeſs. But what he did confeſs, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, I know not; for the confeſſor, you know, never muſt divulge, except, indeed, on very extraordinary occaſions. It was, however, ſomething ſo very ſtrange and horrible, that the grand penitentiary ſuddenly quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the chair, and before he reached the cloiſters he fell into ſtrong convulſions. On recovering himſelf, he aſked the people about him, whether the penitent who had viſited ſuch a confeſſional, naming it, was gone; adding, that if he was ſtill in the church, it was proper he ſhould be detained. He deſcri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed, at the ſame time, as well as he could, the ſort of figure he had dimly ſeen approaching the confeſſional juſt before he had received the confeſſion, at recollecting which, he ſeemed ready to go off again into his convulſions. One of the fathers, who had croſſed the aile on his way to the cloiſters, upon the firſt alarm of Anſaldo's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, remembered that a perſon, ſuch as was deſcribed, had paſſed him haſtily. He had ſeen a tall figure, muffled up in the habit of a white friar, gliding ſwiftly along the aile, towards the door that opened into the outer door of the convent; but he was himſelf too much engaged to notice the ſtranger particularly. Father Anſaldo thought this muſt be the perſon; and the porter was ſummoned, and aſked whether he had obſerved ſuch an one paſs. He affirmed that he had not ſeen any perſon go forth from the gate within the laſt quarter of an hour; which might be true enough,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:032735_0116_0FF46F38ADF54A10"/>
you know, Signor, if the rogue had been off his poſt. But he further ſaid, that no one had entered, during the whole evening, habited in white, as the ſtranger was deſcribed to be: ſo the porter proved himſelf to be a vigilant watchman; for he muſt have been aſleep too, or how could this perſonage have entered the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and left it again, without being ſeen by him!"</p>
                     <p>"In white, was he?" ſaid Vivaldi; "if he had been in black, I ſhould have thought this muſt have been the monk my tormentor."</p>
                     <p>"Why, you know, Signor, that occurred to me before," obſerved Paulo, "and a man might eaſily change his dreſs if that were all."</p>
                     <p>"Proceed," ſaid Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Hearing this account from the porter," continued Paulo, "the Fathers believed one and all, that the ſtranger muſt be ſecreted within the walls; and the convent, with every part of the precincts, was ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but no perſon was found!"</p>
                     <p>"This muſt certainly be the monk," ſaid Vivaldi, notwithſtanding the difference of his habit; there ſurely cannot be two beings in the world, who would conduct themſelves in this ſame myſterious manner!"</p>
                     <p>He was interrupted by a low ſound, which ſeemed to his diſtracted fancy, to proceed from a dying perſon. Paulo alſo heard it; he ſtarted, and they both liſtened with intenſe and almoſt intolerable expectation.</p>
                     <p>"Ah!" ſaid Paulo at length, "it was only the wind.</p>
                     <p>"It was no more," ſaid Vivaldi; proceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

                     <p>"Hark!" cried Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"I hear whiſpers," ſaid Paulo, whiſpering himſelf.</p>
                     <p>"Be ſtill" ſaid Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>They liſtened attentively, and heard a murmuring as of voices; but could not aſcertain whether they came from the adjacent vault, or aroſe from beneath the one in which they were. The ſound returned at intervails; and the perſons who converſed, whatever they were, ſeemingly reſtrained their voices, as if they feared to be heard. Vivaldi conſidered whether it were better to diſcover himſelf, and call for aſſiſtance, or to remain ſtill.</p>
                     <p>"Remember, Signor," ſaid Paulo, "what a chance we have of being ſtarved, unleſs we venture to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ourſelves to theſe people or whatever they are."</p>
                     <p>"Venture!" exclaimed Vivaldi. "What has ſuch a wretch as I to do with fear? O, Ellena, Ellena!"</p>
                     <p>He inſtantly called loudly to the perſon whom he believed he had heard, and was ſeconded by Paulo; but thier continued vociferations availed them nothing; no anſwer was returned; and even the indiſtinct ſounds, which had awakened their attention, were heard no more.</p>
                     <p>Exhauſted by their efforts, they laid down on the floor of the dungeon, abandoning all further attempts at eſcape till the morning light might aſſiſt them.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi had no further ſpirits to enquire for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of Paulo's narrative.

                     <p>DURING ſeveral days after Ellena's arrival at the monaſtery of San Stefano, ſhe was not permitted to leave the room. The door was locked upon her, and not any perſon appeared except the nun, who brought her a ſcanty portion of food, and who was the ſame, that had firſt admitted her into that part of the convent appropriated to the abbeſs.</p>
                     <p>On the fourth-day, when, probably, it was believed that her ſpirits were ſubdued by confinement, and by her experience of the ſuffering ſhe had to expect from reſidence, ſhe was ſummoned to the parlour. The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs was alone, and the air of auſterity, with which ſhe regarded Ellena, prepared the latter to endure.</p>
                     <p>After an exordium on the heniouſneſs of her offence and the neſſeſſity there was for taking meaſures to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the peace and dignity of a noble family, which her late conduct had nearly deſtroyed; the abbeſs infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her, that ſhe muſt determine either to accept the veil, or the perſonwhom the Marcheſa di Vivaldi had, of her great goodneſs, ſelected for her huſband.</p>
                     <p>"You never can be ſufficiently grateful," added the abbeſs, "for the generoſity the Marcheſa diſplays, in allowing you a choice on the ſubject. After the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury you have endeavored to inflict upon her and her family, you could not expect that any indulgence would be ſhewn you. It was natural to ſuppoſe, that the Marcheſa would puniſh you with ſeverity; inſtead of which, ſhe allows you to enter into our ſociety; or, if
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:032735_0119_0FF46EF502F21EB0"/>
you have not ſtrength of mind ſufficient to enable you to renounce a ſinful world, ſhe permits you to return into it, and gives you a ſuitable partner to ſupport you through its cares and toils,—a partner much more ſuitable to your circumſtances than him, to whom you had the temerity to lift your eye."</p>
                     <p>Ellena bluſhed at this coarſe appeal to her pride, and perſevered in a diſdainful ſilence. Thus to give injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the colouring of mercy, and to acts moſt abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tyrannical the ſoftening tints of generoſity, excited her honeſt indignation. She was not, however, ſhoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by a diſcovery of the deſigns formed againſt her, ſince, from the moment of her arrival at San Stefano, ſhe had expected ſomething terribly ſevere, and had, prepared her mind to meet it with fortitude; for ſhe believed, that, ſo ſupported, ſhe ſhould weary the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of her enemies, and finally triumph over misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. It was only when ſhe thought of Vivaldi that her courage failed, and that the injuries ſhe endured ſeem too heavy to be long ſuſtained.</p>
                     <p>"You are ſilent!" ſaid the abbeſs, after a pauſe of expectation. "Is it poſſible, then, that you can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful for the generoſity of the Marcheſa? But, though you may at preſent be inſenſible to her good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I will forbear to take advantage of your indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and will ſtill allow you liberty of choice. You <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ay retire to your chamber, to conſider and to decide. But remember, that you muſt abide by the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you ſhall avow; and, that you will be allowed no appeal from the alternatives which are now placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you. If you reject the veil, you muſt accept the huſband offered you."</p>
                     <p>"It is unneceſſary," ſaid Ellena, with an air of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified tranquility, "that I ſhould withdraw for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of conſidering and deciding. My reſolution is already taken, and I reject each of the offered alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. I will neither condemn myſelf to a cloiſter, or
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:032735_0120_0FF46F3C9F079E68"/>
to the degradation, with which I am threatened on the other hand. Having ſaid this, I am prepared to meet whatever ſuffering you ſhall inflict upon me; but be aſſured, that my own voice never ſhall ſanction the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils to which I may be ſubjected, and that the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal love of juſtice which fills all my heart, will ſuſtain my courage no leſs powerfully than the ſenſe of what is due to my own character. You are now acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my ſentiments and my reſolutions; I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them no more."</p>
                     <p>The abbeſs, whoſe ſurpriſe had thus long ſuffered Ellena to ſpeak, ſtill fixed upon her a ſtern regard, as ſhe ſaid, "Where is it that you have learned theſe heroics, and acquired the raſhneſs which thus prompts you to avow them!—the boldneſs which enables you to inſult your ſuperior, a prieſteſs of your holy reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, even in her ſanctuary!"</p>
                     <p>"The ſanctuary is prophaned," ſaid Ellena, mildly, but with dignity: "it is become a priſon. It is only when the ſuperior ceaſes to reſpect the precepts of that holy religion, the precepts which teach her juſtice and benevolence, that ſhe herſelf is no longer reſpected.—The very ſentiment which bids us revere its mild and beneficent laws, bids us alſo reject the violators of them: when you command me to reverence my reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, you urge me to condemn yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>"Withdraw!" ſaid the abbeſs, riſing impatiently from her chair; "your admonition, ſo becomingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, ſhall not be forgotten."</p>
                     <p>Ellena willingly obeyed, and was led back to her cell, where ſhe ſat down penſively, and reviewed her conduct. Her judgment approved of the frankneſs, with which ſhe had aſſerted her rights, and of the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with which ſhe had reproved a woman, who had dared to demand reſpect from the very victim of her cruelty and oppreſſion. She was the more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with herſelf, becauſe ſhe had never, for an inſtant,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:032735_0121_0FF46EF6AAD652E8"/>
forgotten her own dignity ſo far, as to degenerate into the vehemence of paſſion, or to faulter with the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of fear. Her conviction of the abbeſs's unworthy character was too clear to allow Ellena to feel abaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her preſence; for ſhe regarded only the cenſure of the good, to which ſhe had ever been tremblingly alive, as ſhe was obdurately inſenſible to that of the vicious.</p>
                     <p>Ellena, having now aſſerted her reſolutions, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to avoid, if poſſible, all repetition of ſcenes like the laſt, and to repel, by ſilence only, whatever indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity might be offered her. She knew that ſhe muſt ſuffer, and ſhe reſolved to endure. Of the three evils, which were placed before her, that of confinement, with all its melancholy accompaniments, appeared conſiderably leſs ſevere than either the threatened mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, or a formal renunciation of the world; either of which would devote her, during life, to miſery, and that by her own act. Her choice, therefore, had been eaſy, and the way was plain before her. If ſhe could endure with calmneſs the hardſhips which ſhe could not avoid, half their weight would be unfelt; and ſhe now moſt ſtrenuouſly endeavoured to attain the ſtrength of mind, which was neceſſary to ſupport ſuch equanimity.</p>
                     <p>For ſeveral days after the late interview with the abbeſs, ſhe was kept a cloſe priſoner; but on the fifth evening ſhe was permitted to attend veſpers. As ſhe walked through the garden to the chapel, the ordinary freſhneſs of the open air, and the verdure of the trees and ſhrubs were luxuries to her, who had ſo long been reſtricted from the common bleſſings of nature. She followed the nuns to a chapel where they uſually performed their devotions, and was there ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ated among the novices. The ſolemnity of the ſervice, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of thoſe parts, which were accompanied by muſic, touched all her heart, and ſoothed and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>levated her ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="124" facs="unknown:032735_0122_0FF46F419632F008"/>
Among the voices of the choir, was one whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion immediately fixed her attention; it ſeemed to ſpeak a loftier ſentiment of devotion than the others, and to be modulated by the melancholy of an heart, that had long ſince taken leave of this world. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſwelled with the high peal of the organ, or mingled in low and trembling accents with the ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chorus, Ellena felt that ſhe underſtood all the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the breaſt from which it flowed; and ſhe look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the gallery where the nuns were aſſembled, to diſcover a countenance, that might ſeem to accord with the ſenſibility expreſſed in the voice. As no ſtrangers were admitted to the chapel, ſome of the ſiſters had thrown back their veils, and ſhe ſaw little that intereſted her in their various faces; but the figure and attitude of a nun, kneeling in a remote part of the gallery, beneath a lamp, which threw its rays aſlant her head, perfectly agreed with the idea ſhe had formed of the ſinger, and the ſound ſeemed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach immediately from that direction. Her face was concealed by a black veil, whoſe tranſparency, however, permitted the fairneſs of her complexion to appear; but the air of her head, and the ſingularity of her attitude, for ſhe was the only perſon who remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed kneeling, ſufficiently indicated the ſuperior degree of fervency and penitence, which the voice had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
                     <p>When the hymn had ceaſed ſhe roſe from her knees, and Ellena, ſoon after, obſerved her throw back her veil, diſcovered, by the lamp, which ſhed its full light upon her features, a countenance that inſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed her conjecture. It was touched with a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy kind of reſignation; yet grief ſeemed ſtill to occaſion the paleneſs, and the air of languor, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over it, and which diſappeared only when the momentary energy of devotion ſeemed to lift her ſpirit above this world, and to impart to it ſomewhat of a
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:032735_0123_0FF46EF8A58C1F20"/>
ſeraphic grandeur. At thoſe moments her blue eyes were raiſed towards Heaven, with ſuch meek, yet fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent love, ſuch ſublime enthuſiaſm as the heads of Guido ſometimes diſplay, and which renewed with Ellena, all the enchanting effects of the voice ſhe had juſt heard.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe regarded the nun with a degree of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt which rendered her inſenſible to every other object in the chapel, ſhe fancied ſhe could perceive the calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in her countenance to be that of deſpair, rather than of reſignation; for, when her thoughts were not elevated in prayer, there was frequently a fixedneſs in her look, too energetic for common ſuffering, or for the temper of mind which may lead to perfect reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. It had, however, much that attached the ſympathy of Ellena, and much that ſeemed to ſpeak a ſimilarity of feeling. Ellena was not only ſoothed, but in ſome degree comforted, whilſt ſhe gazed upon her; a ſelfiſhneſs which may, perhaps, be pardoned, when it is conſidered, that ſhe thus knew there was one human being, at leaſt, in the convent, who muſt be capable of feeling pity, and willing to adminiſter conſolation. Ellena endeavoured to meet her eye, that ſhe might inform her of the regard ſhe had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, and expreſs her own happineſs; but the nun was ſo entirely engaged by devotion, that ſhe did not ſucceed.</p>
                     <p>As they left the chapel, however, the nun paſſed cloſe by Ellena, who threw back her veil, and fixed upon her a look ſo ſupplicating and expreſſive, that the nun pauſed, and in her turn regarded the novice, not with ſurpriſe only, but with a mixture of curioſity and compaſſion. A faint bruſh croſſed her cheek, her ſpirits ſeemed to faulter, and ſhe was unwilling to withdraw her eyes from Ellena: but it was neceſſary that ſhe ſhould continue in the proceſſion, and, bidding her farewel by a ſmile of ineffable pity, ſhe paſſed on
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:032735_0124_0FF46F45A2AD3280"/>
to the court, while Ellena followed with attention ſtill fixed upon the ſiſter, who ſoon diſappeared beyond the doorway of the Abbeſs's apartment, and Ellena had nearly reached her own, before her thoughts were ſufficiently diſengaged to permit her to enquire the name of the ſtranger.</p>
                     <p>"It is ſiſter Olivia whom you mean, perhaps," ſaid her conductreſs.</p>
                     <p>"She is very handſome," ſaid Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"Many of the ſiſters are ſo," replied Margaritone, with an air of pique.</p>
                     <p>"Undoubtedly," ſaid Ellena; "but ſhe, whom I mean, has a moſt touching countenance; frank, noble, full of ſenſibility; and there is a gentle melancholy in her eye, which can not but intereſt all who obſerve her."</p>
                     <p>Ellena was ſo faſcinated by this intereſting nun, that ſhe forgot ſhe was deſcribing her to a perſon, whoſe callous heart rendered her inſenſible to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of any countenance, except, perhaps, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding one of the lady abbeſs; and to whom, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a deſcription of the fine traits, which Ellena felt, was as unintelligible as would have been an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabic inſcription.</p>
                     <p>"She is paſſed the bloom of youth," continued Ellena, ſtill anxious to be underſtood; "but ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all its intereſting graces, and adds to them the dignity of"—</p>
                     <p>"If you mean that ſhe is of middle age," interrupted Margaritone, peeviſhly, "it is ſiſter Olivia you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for we are all younger than ſhe is."</p>
                     <p>Ellena, raiſing her eyes almoſt unconſciouſly, as the nun ſpoke this, fixed them upon a face ſallow, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre, ſeemingly near fifty years an inhabitant of this world; and ſhe could ſcarcely ſuppreſs the ſurpriſe ſhe felt, on perceiving ſuch wretched vanity lingering among the chilled paſſions of ſo repulſive a frame, and within the ſequeſtered ſhade of a cloiſter, Margari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:032735_0125_0FF46EFDE6BC5220"/>
ſtill jealous of the praiſe beſtowed on Olivia, repelled all further enquiry, and, having attended El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena to her cell, locked her up for the night.</p>
                     <p>On the following evening Ellena was again per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to attend veſpers, and, on the way to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the hope of ſeeing her intereſting favourite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated her ſpirits. In the ſame part of the gallery, as on the preceding night, ſhe again appeared, and kneeling, as before, beneath the lamp, in private ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for the ſervice was not begun.</p>
                     <p>Ellena endeavoured to ſubdue the impatience ſhe felt to expreſs her regard, and to be noticed by the holy ſiſter, till ſhe ſhould have finiſhed. When the nun roſe, and obſerved Ellena, ſhe lifted her veil, and, fixing on her the ſame enquiring eye, her countenance brightened into a ſmile ſo full of compaſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, that Ellena, forgetting the decorums of the place, left her ſeat to approach her; it ſeemed as if the ſoul, which beamed forth in that ſmile, had long been acquainted with hers. As ſhe advanced, the nun dropped her veil, a reproof which ſhe immediately underſtood, and ſhe withdrew to her ſeat; but her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention remained fixed on the nun during the whole ſervice.</p>
                     <p>At the concluſion, when they left the chapel, and ſhe ſaw Olivia paſs without noticing her, Ellena could ſcarcely reſtrain her tears; ſhe returned in deep de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to her room. The regard of this n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n was not only delightful, but ſeemed neceſſary to her heart, and ſhe dwelt, with fond perſeverance, on the ſmile that had expreſſed ſo much, and which threw one gleam of comfort, even through the bars of her priſon.</p>
                     <p>Her reveries was ſoon interrupted by a light ſtep, that approached her cell, and in the next moment the door was unlocked, and Olivia herſelf appeared. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena roſe with emotion to meet her; the nun held forth her hand to receive hers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="128" facs="unknown:032735_0126_0FF46F478CF3EEE8"/>
"You are unuſed to confinement," ſaid ſhe, curtſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mournfully, and placing on the table a little baſket containing refreſhment, "and our hard fare"—</p>
                     <p>"I underſtand you," ſaid Ellena, with a look ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of her gratitude; "you have a heart that can pity, though you inhabit theſe walls; you have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too and know the delicate generoſity of ſoftening the ſorrows of others, by any attention that may tell them your ſympathy. O! if I could expreſs how much the ſenſe of this affects me!"</p>
                     <p>Tears interrupted her. Olivia preſſed her hand, looked ſteadily upon her face, and was ſomewhat agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, but ſhe ſoon recovered apparent tranquillity, and ſaid, with a ſerious ſmile, "You judge rightly, my ſiſter, reſpecting my ſentiments, however you may do concerning my ſufferings. My heart is not inſenſible to pity, nor to you my child. You were deſigned for happier days than you can hope to find within theſe cloiſters!"</p>
                     <p>She checked herſelf as if ſhe had allowed too much, and then added, "But you may, perhaps, be peaceful; and ſince it conſoles you to know you have a friend near you, believe me that friend—but believe it in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. I will viſit you when I am permitted—but do not enquire for me; and if my viſits are ſhort, do not preſs me to lengthen them."</p>
                     <p>"How good is this!" ſaid Ellena, in a faultering voice. "How ſweet too it is! you will viſit me, and I am pitied by you!"</p>
                     <p>"Huſh!" ſaid the nun, expreſſively; "no more; I may be obſerved. Good night, my ſiſter; may your ſlumbers be light!"</p>
                     <p>Ellena's heart ſunk. She had not ſpirits to ſay, "Good night!" but her eyes, covered with tears, ſaid more. The nun turned her own away ſuddenly, and, preſſing her hand in ſilence, left the cell. Ellena, firm and tranquil under the inſults of the abbeſs, was now
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:032735_0127_0FF46F008397F7B8"/>
melted into tears by the kindneſs of a friend. Theſe gentle tears were refreſhing to her long oppreſſed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and ſhe indulged them. Of Vivaldi ſhe thought with more compoſure than ſhe had done ſince ſhe left the villa Alti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>On the following morning, ſhe perceived that the door of her cell had not been cloſed. She roſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently, and, not without a hope of liberty, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately paſſed it. The cell opening upon a ſhort paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which communicated with the main building, and which was ſhut up by a door, was ſecluded, and almoſt inſulated from every other chamber; and this door being now ſecured, Ellena was as trully a priſoner as before. It appeared then, that the nun had omitted to faſten the cell only for the purpoſe of allowing her more ſpace to walk in the paſſage, and ſhe was grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the attention. Still more ſhe was ſo, when, having traverſed it, ſhe perceived one extremity terminate in a narrow ſtair-caſe, that appeared to lead to other chambers.</p>
                     <p>She aſcended the winding ſteps haſtily, and found they led only to a door, opening into a ſmall room, where nothing remarkable appeared, till ſhe approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the windows, and beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Ellena, with a dreadful pleaſure, looked down them, ſhagged as they were with larch, and frequently darkened by lines of gigantic pine bending along the rocky ledges, till her eye reſted on the thick cheſnut woods that extended over their winding baſe, and which ſoftening to the plains, ſeemed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>orm a grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the variegated cultivation there, and the awful wildneſs of the rocks above. Round theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive plains were tumbled the mountains, of various ſhape and attitude, which Ellena had admired on her approach to San Stefano; ſome ſhaded with foreſts of olive and almond trees, but the greater part abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the flocks, which, in ſummer, feed on their aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic herbage, and on the approach of winter, deſcend to the ſheltered plains of the <hi>Tavogliere di Puglia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the left opened the dreadful paſs which ſhe had traverſed, and the thunder of whoſe waters now mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured at a diſtance. The accumulation of over-top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping points, which the mountains of this dark per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective exhibited, preſented an image of grandeur ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to any thing ſhe had ſeen while within the paſs itſelf.</p>
                     <p>To Ellena, whoſe mind was capable of being highly elevated, or ſweetly ſoothed, by ſcenes of nature, the diſcovery of this little turret was an important circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Hither ſhe could come, and her ſoul, refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the views it afforded, would acquire ſtrength to bear her with equanimity, through the perſecutions that might await her.

How poor the boaſted power of man, when the fall of a ſingle cliff from theſe
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:032735_0129_0FF46F023588F8A8"/>
mountains would with eaſe deſtroy thouſands of his race aſſembled on the plains below! How would it avail them, that they were accoutred for battle, armed with all the inſtruments of deſtruction that human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention ever faſhioned? Thus man, the giant who now held her in captivity, would ſhrink to the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutiveneſs of a fairy; and ſhe would experience, that his utmoſt force was unable to enchain her ſoul, or compel her to fear him, while he was deſtitute of virtue.</p>
                     <p>Ellena's attention was recalled from the ſcene with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out by a ſound from within the gallery, and ſhe then heard a key turning in the door of the paſſage. Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was ſiſter Margaritone who approached, and who, informed by her abſence of the conſolatory turret ſhe had diſcovered, would perhaps debar her from ever returning to it, Ellena deſcended with a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitating heart, and found that nun in the cell. Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and ſeverity were in her countenance, when ſhe enquired by what means Ellena had unlocked the door, and whether ſhe had been.</p>
                     <p>Ellena anſwered without any prevarication, that ſhe had found the door unfaſtened, and that ſhe had viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the turret above; but ſhe forebore to expreſs a wiſh to return thither, judging that ſuch an expreſſion would certainly exclude her in future. Margaritone, after ſharply rebuking her for prying beyond the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and ſetting down the breakfaſt ſhe had brought, left the room, the door of which ſhe did not forget to ſecure. Thus Ellena was at once deprived of ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent a means of conſolation as her pleaſant turret had afforded.</p>
                     <p>During ſeveral days, ſhe ſaw only the auſtere nun, except when ſhe attended veſpers; where, however, ſhe was ſo vigilantly obſerved, that ſhe feared to ſpeak with Olivia, even by h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> eyes. Olivia's were often fixed upon her face, and with a kind of expreſſion
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:032735_0130_0FF46F4E99DEB9F8"/>
which Ellena, when ſhe did venture to look at her, could not perfectly interpret. It was not only of pity, but of anxious curioſity, and of ſomething alſo like fear. A bluſh would ſometimes wander over her cheek, which was ſucceeded by an extreme paleneſs, and by an air of ſuch univerſal langour as precedes a fainting fit: but the exerciſes of devotion ſeemed fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to recal her fleeting ſpirits, and to elevate them with hope and courage.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe left the chapel, Ellena ſaw Olivia no more that night; but on the following morning ſhe came with breakfaſt to the cell. A character of pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſadneſs was on her brow.</p>
                     <p>"O! how glad I am to ſee you!" ſaid Ellena<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "and how much I have regretted your long abſence! I was obliged to remember conſtantly what you had enjoined, to forbear enquiring after you."</p>
                     <p>The nun replied with a melancholly ſmile, "I am come in obedience to our lady abbeſs," ſaid ſhe, as ſhe ſeated herſelf on Ellena's mattreſs.</p>
                     <p>"And did you not wiſh to come?" ſaid Ellena, mournfully.</p>
                     <p>"I did wiſh it," replied Olivia; "but"—and ſhe heſitated.</p>
                     <p>"Whence then this reluctance?" enquired Ellena Olivia was ſilent a moment.</p>
                     <p>"You are a meſſenger of evil news!" ſaid Ellena; "you are only reluctant to afflict me."</p>
                     <p>"It is as you ſay," replied Olivia; "I am only reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to afflict you; and I fear you have too many at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments to the world, to allow you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I am or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to prepare you for the vows, and to ſay, that ſince you have rejected the huſband which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to you, you are to accept the veil; that many of the cuſtomary forms are to be diſpenſed with; and that the ceremony of taking the black veil, will follow without delay that of receiving the white one."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="133" facs="unknown:032735_0131_0FF46F0425955E50"/>
The nun pauſed; and Ellena ſaid, "You are an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing bearer of this cruel meſſage; and I reply only to the lady abbeſs, when I declare, that I never will accept either; that force may ſend me to the altar, but that it never ſhall compel me to utter vows which my heart abhors; and if I am conſtrained to appear there, it ſhall be only to proteſt againſt her tyranny, and againſt the form intended to ſanction it."</p>
                     <p>To Olivia this anſwer was ſo far from being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing, that it appeared to give her ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>"I dare not applaud your reſolution," ſaid ſhe; "but I will not condemn it. You have, no doubt, connections in the world which would render a ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from it afflicting. You have relations, friends, from whom it would be dreadful to part?"</p>
                     <p>"I have neither," ſaid Ellena, ſighing.</p>
                     <p>"No! Can that be poſſible? and yet you are ſo unwilling to retire!"</p>
                     <p>"I have only one friend," replied Ellena, "and it is of him they would deprive me!"</p>
                     <p>"Pardon, my love, the abruptneſs of theſe enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries," ſaid Olivia; "yet, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>As ſhe ſaid this, her agitation was apparent, and ſhe aroſe to go. "I muſt not lengthen my viſit, leſt I ſhould be forbidden to repeat it," ſaid ſhe. "What

anſwer ſhall I give to the abbeſs? If you are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to reject the veil, allow me to adviſe you to ſoften your refuſal as much as poſſible. I am, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, better acquainted with her character than you are; and O, my ſiſter! I would not ſee you pining away your exiſtence in this ſolitary cell."</p>
                     <p>"How much am I obliged by the intereſt you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs for my welfare," ſaid Ellena, "and by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice you offer! I will yield my judgment in this inſtance to yours; you ſhall modulate my refuſal as you think proper: but remember that it muſt be abſolute: and beware, leſt the abbeſs ſhould miſtake gentleneſs for irreſolution."</p>
                     <p>"Truſt me, I will be cautious in all that relates to you," ſaid Olivia. "Farewel! I will viſit you, if poſſible, in the evening. In the mean time the door ſhall be left open, that you may have more air and proſpect than this cell affords. That ſtaircaſe leads to a pleaſant chamber."</p>
                     <p>"I have viſited it already," replied Ellena, "and have to thank you for the goodneſs which permitted me to do ſo. To go thither will greatly ſoothe my ſpirits; if I had ſome book, and my drawing-inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I could almoſt forget my ſorrows there."</p>
                     <p>"Could you ſo?" ſaid the nun, with an affectionate ſmile. "Adieu! I will endeavour to ſee you in the evening. If ſiſter Margaritone returns, be careful not to enquire for me; nor once aſk her for the little indulgence I give you."</p>
                     <p>Olivia withdraw, and Ellena retired to the chamber above, where ſhe loſt for a while all ſenſe of ſorrow amidſt the great ſcenery, which its window exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</p>
                     <p>At noon, the ſtep of Margaritone ſummoned Ellena from her retreat, and ſhe was ſurpriſed that no reproof followed this ſecond diſcovery of her abſence. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garitone only ſaid, that the abbeſs had the goodneſs to

permit Ellena to dine with the novices, and that ſhe came to conduct her to their table.</p>
                     <p>Ellena did not rejoice in this permiſſion, preferring to remain in her ſolitary turret, to the being expoſed to the examining eyes of ſtrangers; and ſhe followed dejectedly, through the ſilent paſſages to the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where they were aſſembled. She was not l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſs ſurpriſed than embarraſſed to obſerve, in the manners of young people reſiding in a convent, an abſence of that decorum, which includes beneath its modeſt ſhade every grace that ought to adorn the female character, like the veil which gives dignity to their air and ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to their features. When Ellena entered the room, the eyes of the whole company were immediately fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon her; the young ladies began to whiſper and ſmile, and ſhewed, by various means, that ſhe was the ſubject of converſation, not otherwiſe than cenſorious. No one advanced to meet and to encourage her, to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her to the table, or ſtill leſs diſplay one of thoſe nameleſs graces, with which a generous and delicate mind delights to re-animate the modeſt and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate.</p>
                     <p>Ellena took a chair in ſilence; and, though ſhe had at firſt felt forlorn and embarraſſed by the impertinent manners of her companions, a conſciouſneſs of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence gradually revived her ſpirits, and enabled her to reſume an air of dignity, which repreſſed this rude preſumption.</p>
                     <p>Ellena returned to her cell, for the firſt time, with eagerneſs. Margaritone did not faſten the door of it, but ſhe was careful to ſecure that of the paſſage; and even this ſmall indulgence ſhe ſeemed to allow with a ſurly reluctance, as if compelled to obey the command of a ſuperior. The moment ſhe was gone, Ellena withdrew to her pleaſant turret, where, after having ſuffered from the coarſe manners of the novices, her gratitude was the more lively, when ſhe perceived the
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:032735_0134_0FF46F51F3E44958"/>
delicate attention of her beloved nun. It appeared that ſhe had viſited the chamber in Ellena's abſence, and had cauſed to be brought thither a chair and a table, on which were placed ſome books, and a knot of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant flowers. Ellena did not repreſs the grateful tears, which the generous feelings of Olivia excited; and ſhe forbore, for ſome moments, to examine the books, that the pleaſing emotions ſhe experienced might not be interrupted.</p>
                     <p>On looking into theſe books, however, ſhe percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that ſome of them treated of myſtical ſubjects, which ſhe laid aſide with diſappointment; but in others ſhe obſerved a few of the beſt Italian poets, and a volume or two of Guicciardini's hiſtory. She was ſomewhat ſurpriſed, that the poets ſhould have found their way to the library of a nun, but was too much pleaſed with the diſcovery to dwell on the enquiry.</p>
                     <p>Having arranged her books, and ſet her little room in order, ſhe ſeated herſelf at a window, and, with a volume of Taſſo, endeavoured to baniſh every pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful remembrance from her mind. She continued wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in the imaginary ſcenes of the poet, till the fading light recalled her to thoſe of reality. The ſun was ſet, but the mountain-tops were ſtill lighted up by his beams, and a tint of glorious purple coloured all the weſt, and began to change the ſnowy points on the horizon. The ſilence and repoſe of the vaſt ſcene, promoted the tender melancholy that prevailed in her heart; ſhe thought of Vivaldi, and wept—of Vivaldi, whom ſhe might, perhaps, never ſee again, though ſhe doubted not that he would be indefatigable in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for her. Every particular of their laſt converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he had ſo earneſtly lamented the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparation, even while he allowed of its propriety, came to her mind; and while ſhe witneſſed, in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, the grief and diſtraction, which her myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious departure and abſence muſt have occaſioned him,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:032735_0135_0FF46F0BA53A22D8"/>
the fortitude, with which ſhe had reſiſted her own ſufferings, yielded to the picture of his.</p>
                     <p>The veſper-bell, at length, ſummoned her to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for maſs, and ſhe deſcended to her cell to await the arrival of her conductreſs. It was Margaritone, who ſoon appeared; but in the chapel ſhe, as uſual, ſaw Olivia, who, when the ſervice had concluded, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited her into the garden of the convent. There, as ſhe walked beneath the melancholy cypreſſes, that ranged on either ſide the long walks, formed a majeſtic canopy, almoſt excluding the evening twilight. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livia converſed with her on ſerious, but general topics, carefully avoiding any mention of the abbeſs, and of the affairs of Ellena. The latter, anxious to learn the effect of her repeated rejection of the veil, ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make ſome enquires, which the nun immediately diſcouraged, and as cautiouſly checked the grateful effuſions of her young friend for the attentions ſhe had received.</p>
                     <p>Olivia accompanied Ellena to her cell, and there no longer ſcrupled to relieve her from uncertainty. With a mixture of frankneſs and diſcretion, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated as much of the converſation, that had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween herſelf and the abbeſs, as it appeared neceſſary for Ellena to know, from which it ſeemed that the former was as obſtinate, as the latter was firm.</p>
                     <p>"Whatever may be your reſolution," added the nun, "I earneſtly adviſe you, my ſiſter, to allow the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ſome hope of compliance, leſt ſhe ſhould proceed to extremities."</p>
                     <p>"And what extremity can be more terrible," repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ellena, "than either of thoſe to which ſhe would now urge me? Why ſhould I deſcend to practice diſſimulation?"</p>
                     <p>"To ſave yourſelf from undeſerved ſufferings," ſaid Olivia mournfully.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, but I ſhould then incur deſerved ones," ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved

                     <p>"I applaud the juſtneſs of your ſentiment," replied Olivia, regarding her with tendereſt compaſſion.—"Alas! that a mind ſo noble ſhould be ſubjected to the power of injuſtice and depravity!"</p>
                     <p>"Not ſubjected," ſaid Ellena, "do not ſay ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I have accuſtomed myſelf to contemplate theſe ſufferings; I have choſen the leaſt of ſuch as were given to my choice, and I will endure them with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; and can you then ſay that I am ſubjected?"</p>
                     <p>"Alas, my ſiſter! you know not what you promiſe," replied Olivia; "you do not comprehend the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which may be preparing for you."</p>
                     <p>As ſhe ſpoke, her eyes filled with tears, and ſhe withdrew them from Ellena, who, ſurpriſed at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme concern on her countenance, entreated ſhe would explain herſelf.</p>
                     <p>"I am not certain myſelf as to this point," ſaid Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via; "and if I were, I ſhould not dare to explain it."</p>
                     <p>"Not dare!" repeated Ellena, mournfully. "Can benevolence like yours know fear, when courage is neceſſary to prevent evil?"</p>
                     <p>"Enquire no further," ſaid Olivia; but no bluſh of conſcious duplicity ſtained her cheek. "It is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that you underſtand the conſequence of open reſiſtance to be terrible, and that you conſent to avoid it."</p>
                     <p>"But how avoid it, my beloved friend, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring a conſequence which, in my apprehenſion, would be yet more dreadful? How avoid it, without either ſubjecting myſelf to a hateful marriage, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the vows? Either of theſe events would be more terrible to me, than any thing with which I may be menaced."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="139" facs="unknown:032735_0137_0FF46F0D813FD300"/>
"Perhaps not," ſaid the nun, "Imagination cannot draw the horrors of—But, my ſiſter, let me repeat, that I would ſave you! O, how willingly ſave you from the evils preparing! and that the only chance of doing ſo is, by prevailing with you to abandon at leaſt the appearance of reſiſtance."</p>
                     <p>"Your kindneſs deeply affects me," ſaid Ellena; "and I am fearful of appearing inſenſible of it, when I reject your advice; yet I cannot adopt it. The very diſſimulation, which I ſhould employ in ſelf-defence, might be a means of involving me in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction."</p>
                     <p>As Ellena concluded, and her eyes glanced upon the nun, unaccountable ſuſpicion occurred to her, that Olivia might be inſincere, and that, at this very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when ſhe was adviſing diſſimulation, ſhe was endeavouring to draw Ellena into ſome ſnare, which the abbeſs had laid. She ſickened at this dreadful ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and diſmiſſed it without ſuffering herſelf to examine its probability. That Olivia, from whom ſhe had received ſo many attentions, whoſe counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and manners announced ſo fair a mind, and for whom ſhe had conceived ſo much eſteem and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould be cruel and treacherous, was a ſuſpicion that gave her more pain than the actual impriſonment in which ſhe ſuffered; and when ſhe looked again upon her face, Ellena was conſoled by a clear convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſhe was utterly incapable of perfidy.</p>
                     <p>"If it were poſſible that I could conſent to practiſe deceit," reſumed Ellena, after a long pauſe, "what could it avail me? I am entirely in the power of the abbeſs, who would ſoon put my ſincerity to the proof; when a diſcovery of my duplicity would only provoke her vengeance, and I ſhould be puniſhed even for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſought to avoid injuſtice."</p>
                     <p>"If deceit is at any time excuſable," replied Olivia, reluctantly, "it is when we pract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

There are ſome rare ſituations, when it may be reſort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to without our incurring ignominy, and yours is one of thoſe. But I will acknowledge, that all the good I expect is from the delay which temporizing may procure you. The Superior, when ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands there is a probability of obtaining your conſent to her wiſhes, may be willing to allow you the uſual time of preparation for the veil, and meanwhile ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may occur to reſcue you from your preſent ſituation."</p>
                     <p>"Ah! could I but believe ſo!" ſaid Ellena; "but alas! what power can reſcue me? And I have not one relative remaining even to attempt my deliverance. To what poſſibility do you allude?"</p>
                     <p>"The Marcheſa may relent."</p>
                     <p>"Does, then, your poſſibility of good reſt with her, my dear friend? If ſo, I am in deſpair again; for ſuch a chance of benefit, there would certainly be little po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy in forfeiting one's integrity."</p>
                     <p>"There are alſo other poſſibilities, my ſiſter," ſaid Olivia; "but, hark! what bell is that? It is the chime which aſſembles the nuns in the apartment of the abbeſs, where ſhe diſpenſes her evening benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. My abſence will be obſerved. Good night, my ſiſter.

                     <p>THE adventurous Vivaldi, and his ſervant Paulo, after paſſing the night of Ellena's departure from the villa Altieri in one of the ſubterraneous chambers of the fort of Palluzz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, and yielding, at length, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted nature, awoke in terror, and utter darkneſs, for the flambeau had expired. When a recollection of the occurrences of the preceding evening returned, they renewed their efforts for liberty with a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>dour. The grated window was again examined, and being found to overlook only a confined court of the fortreſs, no hope appeared of eſcaping.</p>
                     <p>The words of the monk returned with Vivaldi's firſt recollections to torture him with apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that Ellena was no more; and Paulo, unable ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conſole or to appeaſe his maſter, ſat down de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectedly beſide him. Paulo had no longer a hope to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, or a joke to throw away; and he could not forbear ſeriouſly remarking that to die of hunger was one of the moſt horrible means of death, of lamenting the raſhneſs which made them liable to ſo ſad a probability.</p>
                     <p>He was in the midſt of a very pathetic oration, of which, however, his maſter did not hear a ſingle word, ſo wholly was his attention engaged by his own melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly thoughts, when, on a ſudden he became ſilent, and then, ſtarting to his feet, exclaimed, "Signor, what is yonder? Do you ſee nothing?"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi looked round.</p>
                     <p>"It is certainly a ray of light," continued Paulo; "and I will ſoon know where it comes from."</p>

As <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e ſaid this he ſprang forwards, and his ſurprize almoſt equalled his joy when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e diſcovered that the light iſſued through the door of the vault, which ſtood a little open. He could ſcarcely believe his ſenſes, ſince the door had been ſtrongly faſtened on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding night, and he had not heard its ponderous bolts undrawn. He threw it widely open, but recollecting himſelf, ſtopped to look into the adjoining vault before he ventured forth; when Vivaldi darted paſt him, and bidding him follow inſtantly, aſcended to the day. The courts of the fortreſs were ſilent and vacant, and Vivaldi reached the arch way without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aving obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a ſingle perſon, breathleſs with ſpeed, and ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly daring to believe that he had regained his liberty.</p>
                     <p>Beneath the arch he ſtopped to recover breath, and to conſider whether he ſhould take the road to Naples, or to the villa Altieri, for it was yet early morning, and at an hour when it appeared improbable that Ellena's family would be riſen. The apprehenſion of her death had vaniſhed as Vivaldi's ſpirits revived, which the pauſe of heſitation ſufficiently announced: but even this was the pauſe only of an inſtant; a ſtrong anxiety concerning her determined him to proceed to the villa Altieri, notwithſtanding the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitableneſs of the hour, ſince he could at leaſt, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noitre her reſidence, and await till ſome ſign of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily having riſen ſhould appear.</p>
                     <p>"Pray, Signor," ſaid Paulo, while his maſter was deliberating, "do not let us ſtop here, leaſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhould appear again; and do, Signor, take the road which is nearneſt to ſome houſe where we may get breakfaſt, for the fear of ſtarving has taken ſuch hold upon me, that it has nearly anticipated the reality of it already."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi immediately departed for the villa. Paulo, as he danced joyfully along, expreſſed all the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that filled his mind, as to the cauſe of their late
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:032735_0141_0FF46F14A2D6D6A8"/>
impriſonment and eſcape; but Vivaldi, who had now leiſure to conſider the ſubject, could not aſſiſt him in explaining it. The only certainty that appeared, was, that he had not been confined by robbers; and what intereſt any perſon could have in impriſoning him for the night, and ſuffering him to eſcape in the morning, did not appear.</p>
                     <p>On entering the garden at Altieri, he was ſurpriſed to obſerve that ſeveral of the lower lattices were open at this early hour, but ſurpriſe changed to terror, when, on reaching the portico, he heard a moaning of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs from the hall, and, when, after loudly calling, he was anſwered by the piteous cries of Beatrice. The hall door was faſtened, and, Beatrice being unable to open it, Vivaldi, followed by Paulo, ſprang through one of the uncloſed lattices; when on reaching the hall, he found the houſe-keeper bound to a pillar, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Ellena had been carried off during the night by armed men.</p>
                     <p>For a moment he was almoſt ſtupified by the ſhock of this intelligence, and then aſked Beatrice a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand queſtions concerning the affair, without allowing her time to anſwer one of them. When, however, he had patience to liſten, he learned that the ruffians were four in number; that they were maſked; that two of them had carried Ellena thro' the garden, while the others, after binding Beatrice to a pillar, threatening her with death if ſhe made any noiſe, and watching over her till their comrades had ſecured their prize, left her a priſoner. This was all the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſhe could give reſpecting Ellena.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, when he could think coolly, believed he had diſcovered the inſtigators and the deſign of the whole affair, and the cauſe, alſo, of his late confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It appeared that Ellena had been carried off by order of his family, to prevent the intended marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and that he had been decoyed into the fort of
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:032735_0142_0FF46F5D3AC935A8"/>
Paluzzi, and kept a priſoner there, to prevent him from intercepting the ſcheme, which his preſence at the villa Altieri would effectually have done. He had himſelf ſpoken of his former adventure at Paluzzi; and it now appeared, that his family had taken advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the curioſity he had expreſſed, to lead him into the vaults. The event of this deſign was the more certain, ſince, as the fort lay in the direct road to the villa Altieri, Vivaldi could not go thither without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved by the creatures of the Marcheſa, who, by an artful manoeuvre, might make him their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, without employing violence.</p>
                     <p>As he conſidered theſe circumſtances, it appeared certain, alſo, that father Schedoni was in truth the monk who had ſo long haunted his ſteps; that he was the ſecret adviſer of his mother, and one of the authors of the predicted misfortunes which, it ſeemed, he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed a too certain means of fulfilling. Yet Vivaldi, while he admitted the probability of all this, reflected with new aſtoniſhment on the conduct of Schedoni, during his interview with him in the Marcheſa's ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet;—the air of dignified innocence with which he had repreſſed accuſation, the apparent ſimplicity, with which he had pointed out circumſtances reſpecting the ſtranger, that ſeemed to make againſt himſelf; and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi's opinion of the confeſſor's duplicity began to waver. "Yet what other perſon," ſaid he, "could be ſo intimately acquainted with my concerns, or have an intereſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſtrong for thus indefatigably thwarting me, except this confeſſor, who is, no doubt, well rewarded for his perſeverance? The monk can be no other than S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hedoni, yet it is ſtrange that he ſhould have forborn to diſguiſe his perſon, and ſhould appear in his myſterious office in the very habit he uſually wears!"</p>
                     <p>Whatever might be the truth as to Schedoni, it was evident that Ellena had been carried away by order of
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:032735_0143_0FF46F175A0D7EA0"/>
Vivaldi's family, and he immediately returned towards Naples with an intention of demanding her at their hands, not with any hope of their compliance, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that they might accidentally afford him ſome lights on the ſubject. If, however, he ſhould fail to obtain any hint that might aſſiſt him in tracing the route ſhe had been carried, he determined to viſit Schedoni, accuſe him of perfidy, urge him to a full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of his conduct, and, if poſſible, obtain from him a knowledge of Ellena's place of confinement.</p>
                     <p>When, at length, he obtained an interview with the Marcheſe, and, throwing himſelf at his feet, ſupplicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Ellena might be reſtored to her home, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected ſurpriſe of his father overwhelmed him with aſtoniſhment and deſpair. The look and manner of the Marcheſe could not be doubted; Vivaldi was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he was abſolutely ignorant of any ſtep which had been taken againſt Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"However ungraciouſly you have conducted your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf," ſaid the Marcheſe, "my honour has never yet been ſullied by duplicity; however I may have wiſhed to break the unworthy connection you have formed, I ſhould diſdain to employ artifice as the means. If you really deſign to marry this perſon, I ſhall make no other effort to prevent ſuch a meaſure, than by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you the conſequence you are to expect;—from thenceforth I will diſown you for my ſon."</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſe quitted the apartment when he had ſaid this, and Vivaldi made no attempt to detain him. His words expreſſed little more than they had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, yet Vivaldi was ſhocked by the abſolute me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace now delivered. The ſtronger paſſion of his heart, however, ſoon overcame their effect; and this moment, when he began to fear that he had irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably loſt the object of his deareſt affection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, was not the time in which he could feel remoter evils, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate the force of misfortunes which never might
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:032735_0144_0FF46F607A847BE8"/>
arrive. The nearer intereſt preſſed ſolely upon his mind, and he was conſcious only to the loſs of Ellena.</p>
                     <p>The interview, which followed with his mother, was of a different character from that which had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred with the Marcheſe. The keen dart of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, however, ſharpened as it was by love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, pierced beyond the veil of her duplicity; and Vivaldi as quickly detected her hypocriſy as he had yielded his conviction to the ſincerity of the Marcheſe. But his power reſted here; he poſſeſſed no means of awakening her pity or actuating her juſtice, and could not obtain even a hint, that might guide him in his ſearch of Ellena.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni, however, yet remained to be tried; Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi had no longer a doubt as to his having caballed with the Marcheſa, and that he had been an agent in removing Ellena. Whether he was the perſon who haunted the ruins of Paluzzi, ſtill remained to be proved, for, though ſeveral circumſtances ſeemed to declare that he was, others, not leſs plauſible, aſſerted the contrary.</p>
                     <p>On leaving the Marcheſa's apartment, Vivaldi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the convent of the Spirito Santo, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for father Schedoni. The lay-brother who opened the gate, informed him that the father was in his cell, and Vivaldi ſtepped impatiently into the court, requeſting to be ſhewn thither.</p>
                     <p>"I dare not leave the gate, Signor," ſaid the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, "but if you croſs the court, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Vivaldi paſſed on without ſeeing another human being, and not a ſound diſturbed the ſilence of this ſanctuary, till, as he aſcended the ſtairs, a feeble note of lamentation proceeded from the gallery, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He ſtopped, as he had been directed, at the third door, when, as he gently knocked, the ſound ceaſed, and the ſame profound ſilence returned. Vivaldi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated his ſummons, but receiving no anſwer, he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to open the door. In the duſky cell within no perſon appeared, but he ſtill looked round, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſcover ſome one in the dubious gloom. The chamber contained little more than a mattreſs, a chair, a table, and a crucifix; ſome books of devotion were upon the table, one or two of which were written in unknown characters; ſeveral inſtruments of torture lay beſide them. Vivaldi ſhuddered as he haſtily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined theſe, though he did not comprehend the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their application, and he left the chamber, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out noticing any other object, and returned to the court. The porter ſaid, that ſince father Schedoni was not in his cell, he was probably either in the church or in the gardens, for that he had not paſſed the gates during the morning.</p>
                     <p>"Did he paſs yeſter-evening?" ſaid Vivaldi, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly.</p>

                     <p>"Are you certain as to that, my friend?" rejoined Vivaldi, "are you certain that he ſlept in the convent laſt night?"</p>
                     <p>"Who is it that aſks the queſtion?" ſaid the lay-brother, with diſpleaſure, "and what right has he to make it?

Signor, yonder is the church, you will find him there, perhaps!</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi did not linger to reply. "The hypocrite!" ſaid he to himſelf as he croſſed to the church, which formed one ſide of the quadrangle; "but I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſk him."</p>
                     <p>The church, which he entered, was vacant and ſilent like the court. "Whither can the inhabitants of this place have withdrawn themſelves?" ſaid he; "wherever I go, I hear only the echoes of my own ſcotſteps; it ſeems as if death reigned here over all! But, perhaps, it is one of the hours of general me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and the monks have only retired to their cells."</p>
                     <p>As he paced the long aiſles, he ſuddenly ſtopped to catch the ſtartling ſound that murmured through the lofty roof; but it ſeemed to be only the cloſing of a diſtant door. Yet he often looked forward into the ſacred gloom, which the painted windows threw over the remote perſpective, in the expectation of perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a monk. He was not long diſappointed; a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon appeared, ſtanding ſilently in an obſcure part of the cloiſter, cloathed in the habit of this ſociety, and he advanced towards him.</p>
                     <p>The monk did not avoid Vivaldi, or even turn to obſerve who was approaching, but remained in the ſame attitude, fixed like a ſtatue. This tall and gaunt figure had, at a diſtance, reminded him of Schedoni, and Vivaldi, as he now looked under the cowl, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the ghaſtly countenance of the confeſſor.</p>
                     <p>"Have I found you at laſt?" ſaid Vivaldi. "I would ſpeak with you, father, in private. This is not a proper place for ſuch diſcourſe as we muſt hold."</p>
                     <p>Schedoni made no reply, and Vivaldi, once again looking at him, obſerved that his features were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ixed, and his eyes bent towards the ground. The words of Vivaldi ſeemed not to have reached his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:032735_0147_0FF46F1AF735B290"/>
nor even to have made any impreſſion on his ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>He repeated them in a louder tone, but ſtill not a ſingle line of Schedoni's countenance acknowledged their influence. "What means this mummery?" ſaid he, his patience exhauſted, and his indignation arouſed; "This wretched ſubterfuge ſhall not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect you, you are detected, your ſtratagems are known! Reſtore Ellena di Roſalba to her home, or confeſs where you have concealed her."</p>

                        </gap>hedoni was ſtill ſilent and unmoved. A reſpect for his age and profeſſion with-held Vivaldi from ſeizing and compelling him to anſwer; but the agony of impatience and indignation which he ſuffered, formed a ſtriking contraſt to the death-like apathy of the monk. "I now alſo know you," continued Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, "for my tormentor at Paluzzi, the prophet of evils, which you too well practiſed the means of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling, the predictor of the death of Signora Bianchi."

                     <p>The monk raiſed his eyes from the ground, and fixed them with terrible expreſſion upon Vivaldi, but was ſtill ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, father," added Vivaldi, "I know and will proclaim you to the world. I will ſtrip you of the holy hypocriſy in which you ſhroud yourſelf; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce to all your ſociety the deſpicable artifices you have employed, and the miſery you have occaſioned. Your character ſhall be announced aloud."</p>
                     <p>While Vivaldi ſpoke, the monk had withdrawn his eyes, and fixed them again on the ground. His coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance had reſumed its uſual expreſſion.</p>
                     <p>"Wretch! reſtore to me Ellena di Roſalba!" cried Vivaldi, with the ſudden anguiſh of renewed deſpair.
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:032735_0148_0FF4702447754188"/>
"Tell me at leaſt, where ſhe may be found, or you ſhall be compelled to do ſo. Whither, whither have you conveyed her?"</p>
                     <p>As he pronounced this in loud and paſſionate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, ſeveral eccleſiaſtics entered the cloiſters, and were paſſing on to the body of the church, when his voice arreſted their attention. They pauſed, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the ſingular attitude of Schedoni, and the frantic geſticulations of Vivaldi, haſtily advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. "Forbear," ſaid one of the ſtrangers, as he ſeized the cloak of Vivaldi, "do you not obſerve!"</p>
                     <p>"I obſerve a hypocrite," replied Vivaldi, ſtepping back and diſengaging himſelf, "I obſerve a deſtroyer of the peace, it was his duty to protect. I"—</p>
                     <p>"Forbear this deſperate conduct," ſaid the prieſt, "leſt it provoke the juſt vengeance of Heaven! Do you not obſerve the holy office in which he is engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?" pointing to the monk. "Leave the church while you are permitted to do ſo in ſafety; you ſuſpect not the puniſhment you may provoke."</p>
                     <p>"I will not quit the ſpot till you anſwer my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries," ſaid Vivaldi to Schedoni, without deigning even to look upon the prieſt; "Where, I repeat, is Ellena di Roſalba?"</p>
                     <p>The confeſſor was ſtill ſilent and unmoved. "This is beyond all patience and all belief," continued Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi. "Speak! Anſwer me, or dread what I may unfold. Yet ſilent! Do you know the convent del Pianto? Do you know the confeſſional of the Black Penitents?"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi thought he perceived the countenance of the monk ſuffer ſome change. "Do you remember that terrible night," he added, "when, on the ſteps of that confeſſional, a tale was told?"—</p>

                        </gap>hedoni raiſed his eyes, and fixing them once more on Vivaldi, with a look that ſeemed intended to ſtrike him to the duſt, "Avaunt!" cried he in a tremendous

voice; "avaunt! ſacrilegious boy! Tremble for the conſequence of thy deſperate impiety!"</p>
                     <p>As he concluded, he ſtarted from his poſition, and gliding with the ſilent ſwiftneſs of a ſhadow along the cloiſter, vaniſhed in an inſtant. Vivaldi, when at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to purſue him, was ſeized by the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing monks. Inſenſible to his ſufferings, and exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by his aſſertions, they threatened, that if he did not immediately quit the convent, he ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and undergo the ſevere puniſhment to which he had become liable, for having diſturbed and even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted one of their holy order while performing an act of penance.</p>
                     <p>"He had need of ſuch acts," ſaid Vivaldi; "but when can they reſtore the happineſs his treachery has deſtroyed? Your order is diſgraced by ſuch a member, reverend fathers; your"—</p>
                     <p>"Peace!" cried a monk, "he is the pride of our houſe; he is ſevere in his devotion, and in ſelf-puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment terrible beyond the reach of—But I am throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away my commendations, I am talking to one who is not permitted to value or to underſtand the ſacred myſteries of our exerciſes."</p>
                     <p>"Away with him to the Padre Abbate!" cried an enraged prieſt; "away with him to the dungeon!"</p>
                     <p>"Away! away!" repeated his companions, and they endeavoured to force Vivaldi through the cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

When the Marcheſa had been informed of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching marriage, ſhe had, as uſual, conſulted with her confeſſor on the means of preventing it, who had adviſed the ſcheme ſhe adopted, a ſcheme which was the more eaſily carried into effect, ſince the Marcheſa had early in life been acquainted with the abbeſs of San Stefano, and knew, therefore, enough of her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and diſpoſition to confide, without heſitation, the management of this important affair to her diſcretion. The anſwer of the abbeſs to her propoſal, was not merely acquieſcent, but zealous, and it appeared that ſhe too faithfully juſtified the confidence repoſed in her. After this plan had been ſo ſucceſsfully proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, it was not to be hoped that the Marcheſa would be prevailed upon to relinquiſh it by the tears, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, or all the varied ſufferings of her ſon. Vivaldi now reproved the eaſineſs of his own confidence in having hoped it, and quitted her cabinet with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency that almoſt reached deſpair.</p>
                     <p>The faithful Paulo obeyed the haſty ſummons of his maſter, but he had not ſucceeded in obtaining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of Ellena; and Vivaldi, having diſmiſſed him again on the ſame enquiry, retired to his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where the exceſs of grief, and the feeble hope of deviſing ſome ſucceſsful mode of remedy, alternately agitated and detained him.</p>
                     <p>In the evening, reſtleſs and anxious for change, though ſcarcely knowing whither to bend his courſe, he l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Vivaldi with folded arms, and his hat drawn over his face to ſhade his ſorrow from obſervation, paced the edge of the waves, liſtening to their murmur, as they broke gently at his feet, and gazing upon their undulating beauty, while all conſciouſneſs was loſt in melancholy reverie concerning Ellena. Her late reſidence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared

at a diſtance, riſing over the ſhore. He remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered how often from thence they had together view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this lovely ſcene! Its features had now loſt their charm; they were colourleſs and unintereſting, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed only mournful ideas. The ſea fluctuating be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the ſetting ſun, the long mole and its light-houſe tipped with the laſt rays, fiſhermen repoſing in the ſhade, little boats, ſkimming over the ſmooth waters, which their oars ſcarcely dimpled; theſe were images that brought to his recollection the affecting evening when he had laſt ſeen this picture from the villa Altie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, when ſeated in the orangery with Ellena and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anchi on the night preceding the death of the latter, Ellean herſelf had ſo ſolemnly been given to his care, and had ſo affectingly conſented to the dying requeſt of her relative.</p>
                     <p>The recollection of that ſcene came to Vivaldi with all the force of contraſt, and renewed all the anguiſh of deſpair; he paced the beach with quicker ſteps, and long groans burſt from his heart. He accuſed himſelf of indifference and inactivity, for having been thus long unable to diſcover a ſingle circumſtance which might direct his ſearch; and though he knew not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to go, he determined to leave Naples immediately, and return no more to his father's manſion till he ſhould have reſcued Ellena.</p>
                     <p>Of ſome fiſhermen who were converſing together upon the beach, he enquired, whether they could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate him with a boat, in which he meant to coaſt the bay; for it appeared probable that Ellena had been conveyed from Altieri by water, to ſome town or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent on the ſhore, the privacy and facility of ſuch a mode of conveyance being ſuitable to the deſigns of her enemies.</p>
                     <p>"I have but one boat, Signor," ſaid the fiſherman, "and that is buſy enough in going to and fro between here and Santa Lucia, but my comrade, here, perhaps, can ſerve you. What, Carlo, can you help the Signor

to your little ſkiff? the other, I know has enough to do in the trade."</p>
                     <p>His comrade, however, was too much engaged with a party of three or four men, who were liſtening in deep attention round him, to reply; Vivaldi advancing to urge the queſtion, was ſtruck by the eagerneſs with which he delivered his narrative, as well as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couthneſs of his geſticulation; and he pauſed a moment in attention. One of the auditors ſeemed to doubt of ſomething that had been aſſerted. "I tell you," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the narrator, "I uſed to carry fiſh there two and three times a week, and very good ſort of people they were; they have laid out many a ducat with me in their time. But as I was ſaying, when I got there, and knocked upon the door, I heard, all of a ſudden, a huge groaning, and preſently I heard the voice of the old houſekeeper herſelf, roaring out for help; but I could give her none, for the door was faſtened; and while I ran away for aſſiſtance to old Bartoli, you know old Bartoli, he lives by the road ſide as you go to Naples; well while I ran to him, comes a Signor, and jumps through the window and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"What ſtory?" ſaid Vivaldi, "and of whom do you ſpeak?"</p>
                     <p>"All in good time, Maeſtro, you ſhall hear," ſaid the fiſherman, who looking at him for a moment, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, "Why, Signor, it ſhould be you I ſaw there, you ſhould be the very Signor that let Beatrice looſe."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, who had ſcarcely doubted before, that it was Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"I ſhould not wonder," ſaid a Lazzaro, who had been liſtening to the relation; "I ſhould not wonder if the carriage that paſſed Bracelli early on the ſame morning, with the blinds drawn up, though it was ſo

hot that people could ſcarcely breathe in the open air, ſhould prove to be it which carried off the lady!"</p>
                     <p>This hint was ſufficient to re-animate Vivaldi, who collected all the information the Lazzaro could give, which was, however, little more than that a carriage, ſuch as he deſcribed, had been ſeen by him, driving furiouſly through Bracelli, early on the morning men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as that of Signora di Roſalba's departure. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi had now no doubt as to its being the one which conveyed her away, and he determined to ſet out im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately for that place, where he hoped to obtain from the poſt-maſter further intelligence concerning the road ſhe had purſued.</p>
                     <p>With this intention he returned once more to his father's manſion, not to acquaint him with his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or to bid him farewel, but to await the return of his ſervant Paulo, who he meant ſhould accompany him in the ſearch. Vivaldi's ſpirits were now animated with hope, ſlender as were the circumſtances that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported it; and, believing his deſign to be wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected by thoſe who would be diſpoſed to interrupt it, he did not guard either againſt the meaſures, which might impede his departure from Naples, or thoſe which might overtake him on his journey.</p>

improbable that he would have ſealed his ſecret in death, devoting Vivaldi to the grave, had he not been reſtrained by the dreaded vengeance of the Vivaldi fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. Since that hour he had known no peace, and had never ſlept; he had taken ſcarcely any food, and was almoſt continually on his knees upon the ſteps of the high altar. The devotees who beheld him, pauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and admired; ſuch of the brothers as diſliked him, ſneered and paſſed on. Schedoni appeared alike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to each; loſt to this world, and preparing for a higher.</p>
                     <p>The torments of his mind and the ſevere penance he had obſerved, had produced a ſurpriſing change in his appearance, ſo that he reſembled a ſpectre rather than a human being. His viſage was wan and waſted, his eyes were ſunk and become nearly motionleſs, and his whole air and attitudes axhibited the wild energy of ſomething—not of this earth.</p>
                     <p>When he was ſummoned by the Marcheſa, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience whiſpered this to be the conſequence of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which Vivaldi had revealed; and, at firſt, he had determined not to attend her; but, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if it was ſo, his refuſal would confirm ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, he, reſolved to truſt once more to the ſubtilty of his addreſs for deliverence.</p>
                     <p>With theſe apprehenſions, tempered by this hope, he entered the Marcheſa's cloſet. She almoſt ſtarted on obſerving him, and could not immediately withdraw her eyes from his altered viſage, while Schedoni was unable wholly to conceal the perturbation which ſuch earneſt obſervation occaſioned. "Peace reſt with you, daughter!" ſaid he, and he ſeated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without lifting his eyes from the floor.</p>
                     <p>"I wiſh to ſpeak with you, father, upon affairs of moment," ſaid the Marcheſa gravely, "which are probably not unknown to you." She pauſed, and Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:032735_0156_0FF470320CAB5110"/>
bowed his head, awaiting in anxious expectation what was to follow.</p>
                     <p>"You are ſilent, father," reſumed the Marcheſa. "What am I to underſtand by this?"</p>
                     <p>"That you have been miſinformed," replied Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni, whoſe apt conſcience betrayed his diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>"Pardon me," ſaid the Marcheſa, "I am too well informed, and ſhould not have requeſted your viſit if any doubt had remained upon my mind."</p>
                     <p>"Signora! be cautious of what you credit," ſaid the confeſſor imprudently; "you know not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of a haſty credulity."</p>
                     <p>"Would that mine were a raſh credulity!" replied the Marcheſa; "but—we are betrayed."</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>"We?"</hi> repeated the monk, beginning to revive: "What has happened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa informed him of Vivaldi's abſence, and inferred from its length, for it was now ſeveral days ſince his departure, that he had certainly diſcovered the place of Ellena's confinement, as well as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of it.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni differed from her, but hinted, that the obedience of youth was hopeleſs, u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>"Severer!" exclaimed the Marcheſa; "good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is it not ſevere enough to confine her for life?"</p>
                     <p>"I mean ſeverer with reſpect to your ſon, lady," replied Schedoni. "When a young man has ſo far overcome all reverence for an holy ordinance as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly to inſult its profeſſors, and yet more, when that profeſſor is in the very performance of his duties, it is time he ſhould be contrould with a ſtrong hand. I am not in the practice of adviſed to ſuch meaſures, but the conduct of Signor Vivaldi is ſuch as calls aloud for them. Public decency demands it. For myſelf, indeed, I ſhould have endured patiently the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ndignity which has been offered me, receiving it as
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:032735_0157_0FF494682EF88170"/>
a ſalutary mortification, as one of thoſe inflictions that purify the ſoul the from pride, which even the holieſt men may unconſciouſly cheriſh. But I am no longer permitted to conſider myſelf; the public good requires that an example ſhould be made of the horrible impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of which your ſon, it grieves me, daughter, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe it!—your ſon, unworthy of ſuch a mother! has been guilty."</p>
                     <p>It is evident that in the ſtyle, at leaſt, of this accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, Schedoni ſuffered the force of his reſentment to prevail over the uſual ſubtilty of his addreſs, the deep and ſmooth inſinuation of his policy.</p>
                     <p>"To what do you allude, righteous father!" en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the aſtoniſhed Marcheſa; "what indignity, what imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ety has my ſon to anſwer for? I entreat you will ſpeak explicitly, that I may prove I can loſe the mother in the ſtrict ſeverity of the judge."</p>
                     <p>"That is ſpoken with the gradeur of ſentiment, which has always diſtinguiſhed you my daughter! Strong minds perceive that juſtice is the higheſt of the moral attributes, mercy is only the favourite of weak ones."</p>
                     <p>Schedoni had a view in this commendation beyond that of confirming the Marcheſa's preſent reſolution againſt Vivaldi. He, wiſhed to prepare her for mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which might hereafter be neceſſary to accompliſh the revenge he meditated, and he knew that by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering her vanity, he was moſt likely to ſucceed. He praiſed her, therefore, for qualities he wiſhed her to poſſeſs, encouraged her to reject general opinions by admiring as the ſymptoms of a ſuperior underſtanding, the convenient morality upon which ſhe had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally acted; and, calling ſternneſs juſtice, extolled that for ſtrength of mind, which was only callous inſenſibility.</p>
                     <p>He then deſcribed to her Vivaldi's late conduct in the church of the Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ito Santo, exaggerated ſome
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:032735_0158_0FF470357B5043E0"/>
offenſive circumſtances of it, invented others, and formed of the whole an inſtance of monſtrous impiety and unprovoked inſult.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa liſtened to the relation with no leſs indignation that ſurpriſe, and her readineſs to adopt the confeſſor's advice allowed him to depart-with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novated ſpirits and moſt triumphant hopes.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, the Marcheſe remained ignorant of the ſubject of the conference with Schedoni. His opinions had formerly been ſounded, and having been found decidedly againſt the dark policy it was thought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to practiſe, he was never afterwards conſulted reſpecting Vivaldi. Parental anxiety and affection began to revive as the lengthened abſence of his ſon was obſerved. Though jealous of his rank, he loved Vivaldi; and, though he never poſitively believed that he deſigned to enter into a ſacred engagement with a perſon, whom the Marcheſe conſidered to be ſo much his inferior as Ellena, he had ſuffered doubts, which gave him conſiderable uneaſineſs. The preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary abſence of Vivaldi renewed his alarm. He apprehended that if ſhe was diſcovered at this moment, when the fear of loſing her for ever, and the exaſperation, which ſuch complicated oppoſition occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, had awakened all the paſſions of his ſon, this raſh young man might be prevailed upon to ſecure her for his own by the indiſſoluble vow. On the other hand, he dreaded the effect of Vivaldi's deſpair, ſhould he fail in the purſuit; and thus, fearing at one moment that for which he wiſhed in the next, the Marcheſe ſuffered a tumult of mind inferior only to his ſon's.</p>
                     <p>The inſtructions, which he delivered to the ſervants whom he ſent in purſuit of Vivaldi, were given under ſuch diſtraction of thought, that ſcarcely any perſon perfectly underſtood his commiſſion; and, as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa had been careful to conceal from him her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:032735_0159_0FF49469B56E8B08"/>
of Ellena's abode, he gave no direction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the route to San Stefano.</p>
                     <p>While the Marcheſe at Naples was thus employed, and while Schedoni was forming further plans againſt Ellena, Vivaldi was wandering from village to village, and from town to town, in purſuit of her, whom all his efforts had hitherto been unſucceſsful to recover. From the people at the poſt-houſe at Bracelli, he had obtained little information that could direct him; they only knew that a carriage, ſuch as had been already deſcribed to Vivaldi, with the blinds drawn up, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed horſes there that morning, which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>membered to be that of Ellena's departure, and had proceeded on the road to Morgagni.</p>
                     <p>When Vivaldi arrived thither, all trace of Ellena was loſt; the maſter of the poſt could not recollect a ſingle circumſtance connected with the travellers, and even if he had noticed them, it would have been inſufficient for Vivaldi's purpoſe, unleſs he had alſo obſerved the road they followed; for at this place ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral roads branched off into oppoſite quarters of the country; Vivaldi, therefore, was reduced to chuſe of theſe as chance or fancy directed; and as it appeared probable that the Marcheſa had conveyed Ellena to a convent, he determined to make enquires at every one on his way.</p>
                     <p>He had now paſſed over ſome of the wildeſt tracts of the Appennine, among ſcenes which ſeemed aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by civilized ſociety to the banditti who haunted their receſſes. Yet even here amidſt wilds, that were nearly inacceſſible, convents, with each its ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent hamlet, were ſcattered, and ſhrouded from the world by woods and mountains, enjoyed unſuſpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly many of its luxuries, and diſplayed unnoticed, ſome of its elegance. Vivaldi, who had viſited ſeveral of theſe in ſearch of Ellena, had been ſurpriſed at the
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:032735_0160_0FF47039320B66C0"/>
refined courteſy and hoſpitality with which he was received.</p>
                     <p>It was on the ſeventh day of his journey, and near ſun-ſet, that he was bewildered in the woods of Rugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eri. He had received a direction for the road he was to take at a village ſome leagues diſtant, and had obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it confidently till now, when the path was loſt in ſeveral tracts that branched out among the trees. The day was cloſing, and Vivaldi's ſpirits began to fail, but Paulo, light of heart and ever gay, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſhade and pleaſant freſhneſs of the woods, and obſerved, that if his maſter did loſe his way, and was obliged to remain here for the night, it could not be very unlucky, for they could climb among the branches of a cheſnut, and find a more neat and airy lodging than any inn had yet afforded them.</p>
                     <p>While Paulo was thus endeavouring to make the beſt of what might happen, and his maſter was ſunk in reverie, they ſuddenly heard the ſound of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and voices from a diſtance. The gloom, which the trees threw round, prevented their diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing objects afar off, and not a ſingle human being was viſible, nor any trace of his art, beneath the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy ſcene. They liſtened to aſcertain from what direction the ſounds approached, and heard a chorus of voices, accompanied by a few inſtruments, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the evening ſervice.</p>
                     <p>"We are near a convent, Signor," ſaid Paulo, "liſten! they are at their devotions."</p>
                     <p>"It is as you ſay," replied Vivaldi; "and we will make the beſt of our way towards it."</p>
                     <p>"Well, Signor! I muſt ſay, if we find as good do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings here as we had at the Capuchin's, we ſhall have no reaſon to regret our beds <hi>alfreſco</hi> among the cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut branches."</p>
                     <p>"Do you perceive any walls or ſpires beyond the trees?" ſaid Vivaldi, as he led the way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="163" facs="unknown:032735_0161_0FF4947616FA9950"/>
"None, Signor," replied Paulo; "yet we draw nearer the ſounds. Ah, Signor? do you hear that note? How it dies away? And thoſe inſtruments juſt touched in ſymphony! This is not the muſic of peaſants; a convent muſt be near, though we do not ſee it."</p>
                     <p>Still as they advanced, no walls appeared, and ſoon after the muſic ceaſed; but other ſounds led Vivaldi forward to a pleaſant part of the woods, where the trees opening, he perceived a party of pilgrims ſeated on the graſs. They were laughing and converſing with much gaiety, as each ſpread before him the ſupper, which he drew from his ſcrip; while he, who appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the Father-Director of the pilgrimage, ſat with a jovial countenance in the midſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, diſpenſing jokes and merry ſtories, and receiving in return a tribute from every ſcrip. Wines of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſorts were ranged before him, of which he drank abundantly, and ſeemed not, to refuſe any dainty that was offered.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, whoſe apprehenſions were now quieted, ſtopped to obſerve the groupe, as the evening rays, glancing along the ſkirts of the wood, threw a gleam upon their various countenances, ſhewing, however, in each a ſpirit of gaiety that might have characteriſed the individuals of a party of pleaſure, father than thoſe of a pilgrimage. The Father Director and his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lock ſeemed perfectly to under each other; the Superior willingly reſigned the ſolemn auſterity of his office, and permitted the company to make themſelves as happy as poſſible, in conſideration of receiving plenty of the moſt delicate of their viands; yet ſomewhat of dignity was mingled with his condeſcenſions, that compelled them to receive even his jokes with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of deference, and perhaps they laughed at them leſs for their ſpirit than becauſe they were favours.</p>
                     <p>Addreſſing the Superior, Vivaldi requeſted to be

directed how he might regain his way. The father examined him for a moment before he replied, but obſerving the elegance of his dreſs, and a certain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of diſtinction; and perceiving, alſo, that Paulo was his ſervant, he promiſed his ſervices, and invited him to take a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>at at his right hand, and partake of the ſupper.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, underſtanding that the party was going his road, accepted the invitation, when Paulo, having faſtened the horſes to a tree, ſoon became buſy with the ſupper. While Vivaldi converſed with the father, Paulo engroſed all the attention of the pilgrims near him; they declared he was the clevereſt and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt fellow they had ever ſeen, and often expreſſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> a wiſh that he was going as far with them as to the ſhrine in a convent of Carmelites which terminated their pilgrimage. When Vivaldi underſtood that this ſhrine was in the church of a convent, partly inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by nuns, and that it was little more than a league and a half diſtant, he determined to accompany them, for it was as poſſible that Ellena was confined there as in any other cloiſter; and of her being impriſoned in ſome convent, he had leſs doubt, the more he conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the character and views of his mother. He ſet forward, therefore, with the pilgrims, and on foot, having reſigned his horſe to the weary Father-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector.</p>
                     <p>Darkneſs cloſed over them long before they reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the village where they deſigned to paſs the night; but they beguiled the way with ſongs and ſtories, now and then only ſtopping at command of the Father, to repent ſome prayer or ſing a hymn. But, as they drew near a village, at the baſe of the mountain on which the ſhrine ſtood, they halted to arrange themſelves in proceſſion; and the Superior having ſtopped ſhort in the midſt of one of his beſt jokes, diſmounted Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di's horſe, placed himſelf at their head, and beginning
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:032735_0163_0FF494779FA64798"/>
a loud ſtrain, they proceeded in full chorus of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly muſic.</p>
                     <p>The peaſants hearing their ſonorous voices, came <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>orth to meet and conduct them to their cabins. The village was already crowded with devotees, but theſe poor peaſants, looking up to them with love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, made every poſſible contrivance to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date all who came; notwithſtanding which, when Paulo ſoon after turned into his bed of ſtraw, he had more reaſons than one to regret his cheſnut <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Vivaldi paſſed an anxious night, waiting impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently for the dawning of that day, which might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly reſtore to him Ellena. Conſidering that a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim's habit would not only conceal him from ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, but allow him opportunities for obſervation, which his own dreſs would not permit, he employed Paulo to provide him one. The addreſs of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, aſſiſted by a ſingle ducat, eaſily procured it, and at an early hour he ſet forward on his enquiry.</p>

                     <p>A FEW devotees only had begun to aſcend the mountain, and Vivaldi kept aloof even from theſe, purſuing a lonely track, for his thoughtful mind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſolitude.

Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment had ſubdued the wilder energy of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and produced a ſolemn and lofty ſtate of feeling; he viewed with pleaſing ſadneſs the dark rocks and precipices, the gloomy mountains and vaſt ſolitudes, that ſpread around him; nor was the convent that he was approaching a leſs ſacred feature of the ſcene, as its gray walls and pinacles appeared beyond the duſky groves. "Ah! if it ſhould encloſe her!" ſaid Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, as he caught a firſt glimpſe of its hall. "Vain hope! I will not invite your illuſions again, I will not expoſe myſelf to the agonies of new diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I will ſearch, but not expect. Yet, if ſhe ſhould be there!"</p>
                     <p>Having reached the gates of the convent, he paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with haſty ſteps into the court; where his emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion encreaſed as he pauſed a moment and looked round its ſilent cloiſters. The porter only appeared, when Vivaldi, fearful leſt he ſhould perceive him not to be a pilgrim, drew his hood over his face, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering up his garments ſtill cloſer in his folded arms,

paſſed on without ſpeaking, though he know not which of the avenues before him led to the ſhrine. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, however, towards the church, a ſtately edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, from the other parts of the convent. Its highly vaulted aiſles, extending in twilight perſpective, where a monk or a pilgrim only, now and then croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whoſe dark figures, paſſing without ſound, vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like ſhadows; the univerſal ſtillneſs of the place, the gleam of tapers from the high altar, and of lamps, which gave a gloomy pomp to every ſhrine in the church: all theſe circumſtances conſpired to impreſs a ſacred awe upon his heart.</p>
                     <p>He followed ſome devotees through a ſide aiſle to a court, that was overhung by a tremendous rock, in which was a cave, containing the ſhrine of <hi>our Lady of Mount Carmel.</hi> This court was encloſed by the rock, and by the choir of the church, except that to the ſouth a ſmall opening led the eye to a glimpſe of the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape below, which, ſeen beyond the dark jaws of the cliff, appeared free, and light, and gaily coloured, melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away into the blue and diſtant mountains.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi entered the cave, where, encloſed within a filigree ſcreen of gold, lay the image of the ſaint, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corated with flowers, and lighted up by innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lamps and tapers. The ſteps of the ſhrine were thronged with kneeling pilgrims, and Vivaldi, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſingularity, kneeled alſo; till a high peal of the organ, at a diſtance, and the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He left the cave, and, returning into the church, loitered at an extremity of the aiſles, where he liſtened awhile to the ſolemn harmony pealing along the roofs, and ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away in diſtance. It was ſuch full and entranc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſic as frequently ſwells in the high feſtivals of the Sicilian church, and is adapted to inſpire that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime enthuſiaſm, which ſometimes elevates its diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Vivaldi, unable to endure long the exceſs of
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:032735_0166_0FF585247B675A08"/>
feeling, which this harmony awakened was leaving the church, when ſuddenly it ceaſed, and the tolling of a bell ſounded in its ſtead. This ſeemed to be the knell of death, and it occurred to him, that a dying per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was approaching to receive the laſt ſacrament; when he heard remotely a warbling of female voices, mingling with the deeper tones of the monks, and with the hollow note of the bell, as it ſtruck at intervals. So ſweetly, ſo plaintively, did the ſtrain grow on the air, that thoſe who liſtened, as well as thoſe, who ſung, were touched with ſorrow, and ſeemed equally to mourn for a departing friend.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi haſtened to the choir, the pavement of which was ſtrewn with palm-branches and freſh flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. A pall of black velvet lay upon the ſteps of the altar, where ſeveral prieſts were ſilently attending. Every where appeared the enſigns of ſolemn pomp and ceremony, and in every countenance the ſtillneſs and obſervance of expectation. Meanwhile the ſounds draw nearer, and Vivaldi perceived a proceſſion of nuns approaching from a diſtant aiſle.</p>
                     <p>As they advanced, he diſtinguiſhed the lady abbeſs leading the train, dreſſed in her pontifical robes, with the mitre on her head; and well he marked her ſtately ſtep, moving in time to the ſlow minſtrelſy, and the air of proud yet graceful dignity, with which ſhe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterized herſelf. Then followed the nuns, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their ſeveral orders, and laſt came the novices, carrying lighted tapers, and ſurrounded by other nuns, who were diſtinguiſhed by a particular habit.</p>
                     <p>Having reached a part of the church appropriated for their reception, they arranged themſelves in order. Vivaldi, with a palpitating heart, enquired the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ceremony, and was told that a nun was going to be profeſſed.</p>
                     <p>"You are informed, no doubt, brother," added th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

morning of our high feſtival, our Lady's day, it is uſual for ſuch as devote themſelves to heaven, to receive the veil. Stand bye a while, and you will ſee the ceremony.</p>
                     <p>"What is the name of the novice who is now to receive it?" ſaid Vivaldi, in a voice whoſe tremulous accents betrayed his emotion.</p>
                     <p>The friar glanced an eye of ſcrutiny upon him, as he replied, "I know not her name, but if you will ſtep a little this way, I will point her out to you."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, drawing his hood over his face, obeyed in ſilence.</p>
                     <p>"It is ſhe on the right of the abbeſs," ſaid the ſtranger, "who leans on the arm of a nun, ſhe is covered with a white veil, and is taller than her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi obſerved her with a fearful eye, and though he did not recognize the perſon of Ellena, yet, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was that his fancy was poſſeſſed with her image, or that there was truth in his ſurmiſe, he thought he perceived a reſemblance of her. He enquired how long the novice had reſided in the convent, and many other par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iculars, to which the ſtranger could not or dared not reply.</p>
                     <p>With what anxious ſolicitude did Vivaldi endeavour to look through the veils of ſeveral nuns in ſearch of Ellena, whom he believed the barbarous policy of his mother might already have devoted to the cloiſter! With a ſolicitude ſtill ſtronger he tried to catch a glimpſe of the features of the novices, but their faces were ſhaded by hoods, and their white veils, though thrown half back, were diſpoſed in ſuch artful folds that they concealed them from obſervation, as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as did the pendant lawn the features of the nuns.</p>
                     <p>The ceremony began with the exhortation of the Father-Abbot, delivered with a ſolemn energy; then the novice kneeling before him, made her pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="170" facs="unknown:032735_0168_0FF4704365043240"/>
for which Vivaldi liſtened with intenſe attention, but it was delivered in ſuch low and trembling accents, that he could not aſcertain even the tone. But dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the anthem that mingled with the enſuing part of the ſervice, he thought he diſtinguiſhed the voice of Ellena, that touching and well-known voice, which in the church of San Lorenzo had firſt attracted his attention. He liſtened, ſcarcely daring to draw breath, leſt he ſhould loſe a note; and again he fancied her voice ſpoke in a part of the plaintive reſponſe deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the nuns.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi endeavoured to command his emotion, and to await with patience ſome further unfolding of the truth; but when the prieſt prepared to withdraw the white veil from the face of the novice, and throw the black one over her, dreadful expectation that ſhe was Ellena ſeized him, and he with difficulty forbore ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping forward and diſcovering himſelf on the inſtant.</p>
                     <p>The veil was at length withdrawn, and a very love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly face appeared, but not Ellena's. Vivaldi breathed again, and waited with tolerable compoſure for the concluſion of the ceremony; till in the ſolemn ſtrain that followed the putting on of the black veil, he heard again the voice, which he was now convinced was her's. Its accents were low, and mournful, and tremulous, yet his heart acknowledged inſtantaneouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their magic influence.</p>
                     <p>When this ceremony had concluded, another began; and he was told it was that of a noviciation. A young woman, ſupported by two nuns, advanced to the altar, and Vivaldi thought he beheld Ellena. The prieſt was beginning the cuſtomary exhortation, when ſhe lifted her half-veil, and, ſhewing a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance where meek ſorrow was mingled with heavenly ſweetneſs, raiſed her blue eyes, all bathed in tears, and waved her hand as if ſhe would have ſpoken.—It was Ellena herſelf.</p>

The pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"I proteſt in the preſence of this congregation," ſaid ſhe ſolemnly, "that I am brought hither to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce vows which my heart diſclaims. I proteſt"—</p>
                     <p>A confuſion of voices interrupted her, and at the ſame inſtant ſhe perceived Vivaldi ruſhing towards the altar. Ellena gazed for a moment, and then, ſtretching forth her ſupplicating hands towards him, cloſed her eyes, and ſunk into the arms of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons round her, who vainly endeavoured to prevent him from approaching and aſſiſting her. The anguiſh, with which he bent over her lifeleſs form, and called upon her name, excited the commiſeration even of the nuns, and eſpecially Olivia, who was moſt aſſiduous in efforts to revive her young friend.</p>
                     <p>When Ellena uncloſed her eyes, and looking up, once more beheld Vivaldi, the expreſſion with which ſhe regarded him, told that her heart was unchanged, and that ſhe was unconſcious of the miſeries of impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment while he was with her. She deſired to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, and, aſſiſted by Vivaldi and Olivia, was leaving the church, when the abbeſs ordered that ſhe ſhould be attended by the nuns only; and, retiring from the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, ſhe gave directions that the young ſtranger ſhould be conducted to the parlour of the convent.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, though he refuſed to obey an imperious command, yielded to the entreaties of Ellena, and to the gentle remonſtrances of Olivia; and bidding El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena farewell for a while, he repaired to the parlour of the abbeſs. He was not without ſome hope of awakening her to a ſenſe of juſtice, or of pity; but he found that her notions of right were inexorably againſt him, and that pride and reſentment uſurped the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of every other feeling. She began her lecture with expreſſing the warm friendſhip ſhe had ſo long cheriſhed for the Marcheſa, proceeded to lament that the ſon of a friend, whom ſhe ſo highly eſteemed,
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:032735_0170_0FF470453A463A68"/>
ſhould have forgotten his duty to his parents, and the obſervance due to the dignity of his houſe, ſo far as to ſeek connection with a perſon of Ellena di Roſalba's inferior ſtation; and concluded with a ſevere repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for having diſturbed the tranquility of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and the decorum of the church by his intruſion.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi liſtened with ſubmitting patience to this mention of morals and decorum from a perſon, who, with the moſt perfect ſelf-applauſe, was violating ſome of the plaineſt obligations of humanity and juſtice; who had conſpired to tear an orphan from her home, and who deſigned to deprive her for life of liberty, with all the bleſſings it inherits. But, when ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to ſpeak of Ellena with the cauſtic of ſevere reprobation, and to hint at the puniſhment, which her public rejection of the vows had incurred, the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Vivaldi ſubmitted no longer; indignation and contempt roſe high againſt the Superior, and he exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited a portrait of herſelf in the ſtrong colours of truth. But the mind, which compaſſion could not perſuade, reaſon could not appal; ſelfiſhneſs had hardened it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to the influence of each; her pride only was affected, and ſhe retaliated the mortification ſhe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by menace and denunciation.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, on quitting her apartment, had no other reſource than an application to the Abate, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, at leaſt, if not his authority, might aſſuage the ſeverity of her power. In this Abate, a mildneſs of temper, and gentleneſs of manner were qualities of leſs value than is uſually and deſervedly imputed to them; for, being connected with feebleneſs of mind, they were but the pleaſing merits of eaſy times, which in an hour of difficulty never aſſumed the character of virtues, by inducing him to ſerve thoſe, for whom he might feel. And thus, with a temper and diſpoſition directly oppoſite to thoſe of the ſevere and violent ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs, he was equally ſelfiſh, and almoſt equally culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:032735_0171_0FF494884B805600"/>
ſince by permitting evil, he was nearly as injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his conduct as thoſe who planned it. Indolence and timidity, a timidity the conſequence of want of clear perception, deprived him of all energy of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; he was prudent rather than wiſe, and ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of being thought to do wrong that he ſeldom did right.</p>
                     <p>To Vivaldi's temperate repreſentations and earneſt entreaties that he would exert ſome authority towards liberating Ellena, he liſtened with patience; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the hardſhips of her ſituation; lamented the unhappy diviſions between Vivaldi and his family, and then declined advancing a ſingle ſtep in ſo delicate an affair. Signora di Roſalba, he ſaid, was in the care of the abbeſs, over whom he had no right of control in matters relative to her domeſtic concerns. Vivaldi then ſupplicated, that, though he poſſeſſed no authority, he would, at leaſt, intercede or remonſtrate againſt ſo unjuſt a procedure as that of detaining Ellena a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and aſſiſt in reſtoring her to the home, from which ſhe had been forcibly carried.</p>
                     <p>"And this, again," replied the Abate, "does not come within my juriſdiction; and I make it a rule not to encroach upon that of another perſon."</p>
                     <p>"And can you endure, holy father," ſaid Vivaldi, "to witneſs a flagrant act of injuſtice and not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to counteract it? not even ſtep forward to reſcue the victim when you perceive the preparation for the ſacrifice?"</p>
                     <p>"I repeat, that I never interfere with the authority of others," replied the Superior; "having aſſerted my own, I yield to them in their ſphere, the obedience which I require in mine."</p>
                     <p>Is power then," ſaid Vivaldi, "the infallible teſt of juſtice? Is it morality to obey where the command is criminal? The whole world have a claim upon the fortitude, the active fortitude of thoſe who are placed

                     <p>"Would that the whole world were wrong that you might have the glory of ſetting it right!" ſaid the Abate, ſmiling. "Young man! you are an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſt, and I pardon you.

He perceived that he muſt now have recourſe to further ſtratagem, a recourſe which his frank and noble mind deteſted, but he had already tried without ſucceſs, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other poſſibility of reſcuing the innocent victim of the Marcheſa's prejudice and pride.</p>
                     <p>Ellena meanwhile had retired to her cell, agitated by a variety of conſiderations, and contrary emotions, of which, however, thoſe of joy and tenderneſs were long predominant. Then came anxiety, apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, pride, and doubt, to divide and torture her heart. It was true that Vivaldi had diſcovered her priſon, but, if it were poſſible, that he could releaſe her, ſhe muſt conſent to quit it with him; a ſtep from which a mind ſo tremblingly jealous of propriety as hers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coiled with alarm, though it would deliver her from captivity. And how, when ſhe conſidered the haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty character of the Marcheſe di Vivaldi, the imperious and vindictive nature of the Marcheſa, and, ſtill mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

herſelf into ſuch a family! Pride, delicacy, good ſenſe ſeemed to warn her againſt a conduct ſo humiliating and vexatious in its conſequences, and to exhort her to preſerve her own dignity by indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Though the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which her deceaſed relative had given to this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, ſeemed to impart to it a ſacred character, that conſiderably ſoothed the alarmed delicacy of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena, the approbation thus implied, had no power to ſilence her own objections, and ſhe would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted the miſtaken zeal, which had contributed to lead her into the preſent diſtreſſing ſituation, had ſhe revered the memory of her aunt, or loved Vivaldi, leſs. Still, however, the joy, which his preſence had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and which the conſciouſneſs that he was ſtill near her had prolonged, was not ſubdued, though it was frequently obſcured by ſuch anxious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. With jealous and indiſcreet ſolicitude, ſhe now recollected every look, and the accent of every word, which had told that his affection was undiminiſhed, thus ſeeking, with inconſiſtent zeal for a conviction of the very tenderneſs, which but a moment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>She awaited with extreme anxiety the appearance of Olivia, who probably might know the reſult of Vivaldi's conference with the abbeſs, and whether he was yet in the convent.</p>
                     <p>In the evening Olivia came, a meſſenger of evil; and Ellena, informed of the conduct of the abbeſs, and the conſequent departure of Vivaldi, perceived all her courage, and all the half-formed reſolutions, which a conſideration of his family had ſuggeſted, faulter and
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:032735_0174_0FF4704DEE71A600"/>
expire. Senſible only of grief and deſpondency, ſhe aſcertained, for the firſt time the extent of her affection and the ſeverity of her ſituation. She perceived, alſo, that the injuſtice which his family had exerciſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, abſolved her from all conſideration of their diſpleaſure, otherwiſe than as it might affect herſelf; but this was a conviction, which it were now proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly uſeleſs to admit.</p>
                     <p>Olivia not only expreſſed the tendereſt intereſt in her welfare but ſeemed deeply affected with her ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; and, whether it was, that the nun's misfortunes bore ſome reſemblance to Ellena's, or from whatever cauſe, it is remarkable that her eyes were often filled with tears, while ſhe regarded her young friend, and ſhe betrayed ſo much emotion that Ellena noticed it with ſurpriſe. She was, however, too delicate to hint any curioſity on the ſubject; and too much engaged by a nearer intereſt to dwell long upon the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                     <p>When Olivia withdrew, Ellena retired to her tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, to ſoothe her ſpirits with a view of ſerene and majeſtic nature, a recourſe which ſeldom failed to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate her mind and ſoften the aſperities of affliction.—It was to her like ſweet and ſolemn muſic, breathing peace over the ſoul—like the oaten ſtop of Milton's Spirit,

within the walls of San Stefano, and the tone diffuſed over her ſpirits a pleaſing melancholy, that rapt all her attention. The liquid cadence as it trembled and ſunk away, ſeemed to tell the dejection of no vulgar feelings, and the exquiſite taſte, with which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining notes again ſwelled, almoſt convinced her, that the muſician was Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>On looking from the lattice, ſhe perceived a perſon perched on a point of the cliff below, whither it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared almoſt impracticable for any human ſtep to have climbed, and preſerved from the precipice only by ſome dwarf ſhrubs that fringed the brow. The twilight did not permit her immediately to aſcertain whether it was Vivaldi, and the ſituation was ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous that ſhe hoped it was not he.

                     <p>Vivaldi had learned from a lay-brother of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, whom Paulo had bribed, and who when he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the garden, had ſometimes ſeen Ellena at the window, that ſhe frequented this remote turret; and, at the hazard of his life, he had now ventured thither, with a hope of converſing with her.</p>
                     <p>Ellena, alarmed at his tremendus ſituation, refuſed to liſten to him, but he would not leave the ſpot till he had communicated a plan concerted for her eſcape, and, entreating that ſhe would confide herſelf to his care, aſſured her ſhe would be conducted wherever ſhe judged proper. It appeared that the brother had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to aſſiſt his views, in conſideration of an ample reward, and to admit him within the walls on this evening, when, in his pilgrim's habit, he might have an opportunity of again ſeeing Ellena. He conjured her to attend, if poſſible, in the convent parlour dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſupper, explaining, in a few words, the motive for this requeſt, and the ſubſtance of the following particulars:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="178" facs="unknown:032735_0176_0FF4704F98E11078"/>
The Lady-abbeſs, in obſervance of the cuſtom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on high feſtivals, gave a collation to the <hi>Padre-abate,</hi> and ſuch of the prieſts as had aſſiſted at the veſper-ſervice. A few ſtrangers of diſtinction and pilgrims were alſo to partake of the entertainments of this night, among which was included a concert to be performed by the nuns. At the collation was to be diſplayed a profuſion of delicacies, arranged by the ſiſters, who had been buſy in preparing the paſtry and confectionary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſeveral days, and who excelled in theſe articles no leſs than in embroid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ry and other ingenious arts. This ſupper was to be given in the abbeſs's outer parlour, while ſhe herſelf, attended by ſome nuns of high rank, and a few favourites, was to have a table in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner apartment, where, ſeparated only by the grate, ſhe could partake of the converſation of the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The tables were to be ornamented with arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial flowers, and a variety of other fanciful devices upon which the ingenuity of the ſiſters had been long employed, who prepared for theſe feſtivals with as much vanity, and expected them to diſſipate the gloomy monotony of their uſual life, with as much eagerneſs of delight, as a young beauty anticipates a firſt ball.</p>
                     <p>On this evening, therefore, every member of the convent would be engaged either by amuſement or buſineſs, and to Vivaldi, who had been careful to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf of theſe circumſtances, it would be eaſy, with the aſſiſtance of the brother, to obtain admittance, and mingle himſelf among the ſpectators, diſguiſed in his pilgrim's habit. He entreated, therefore, that El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena would contrive to be in the abbeſs's apartment this evening, when he would endeavour to convey to her ſome further particulars of the plan of eſcape, and would have mules in waiting at the foot of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to conduct her to the villa Altieri, or to the neighbouring convent of the Santa della Pieta. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi ſecretly hoped that ſhe might be prevailed with
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:032735_0177_0FF494942EE0FA00"/>
to give him her hand on quitting San Stefano, but he forbore to mention this hope, leſt it ſhould he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for a condition, and that Ellena might be either reluctant to accept his aſſiſtance, or, accepting it, might conſider herſelf bound to grant a haſty conſent.</p>
                     <p>To his mention of eſcape ſhe liſtened with varying emotion; at one moment attending to it with hope and joy, as promiſing her the only chance of liberation from an impriſonment, which was probably intended to laſt for her life, and of reſtoring her to Vivaldi; and at another, recoiling from the thought of departing with him, while his family was ſo decidedly averſe to their marriage. Thus, unable to form any inſtant reſolution on the ſubject, and entreating that he would leave his dangerous ſtation before the thickening twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light ſhould encreaſe the hazard of his deſcent, Ellena, added, that ſhe would endeavour to obtain admittance to the apartment of the abbeſs, and to acquaint him with her final determination. Vivaldi underſtood all the delicacy of her ſcruples, and though they afflicted him, he honoured the good ſenſe and juſt pride that ſuggeſted them.</p>
                     <p>He lingered on the rock till the laſt moments of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting light, and then, with a heart fluttering with hopes and fears, bade Ellena farewel, and deſcended; while ſhe watched his progreſs thro' the ſilent gloom, faintly diſtinguiſhing him gliding along ledges of the precipice, and making his adventurous way from cliff to cliff, till the winding thick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>s concealed him from her view. Still anxious, ſhe remained at the lattice, but he appeared no more; no voice announced diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter; and, at length, ſhe returned to her cell, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate on the ſubject of her departure.</p>
                     <p>Her conſiderations were interrupted by Olivia, whofe manner indicated ſomething extraordinary; the uſual tranquility of her countenance was gone, and an air of grief mingled with apprehenſion appeared there.
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:032735_0178_0FF470514DB44148"/>
Before ſhe ſpoke, ſhe exammined the paſſage and looked round the cell. "It is as I feared," ſaid ſhe abruptly; "my ſuſpicions are juſtified, and you, my child, are ſacrificed, unleſs it were poſſible for you to quit the convent this night."</p>
                     <p>"What is it that you mean?" ſaid the alarmed Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"I have juſt learned," reſumed the nun, "that your conduct this morning, which is underſtood to have thrown a premeditated inſult upon the abbeſs, is to be puniſhed with what they call impriſonment; alas! why ſhould I ſoften the truth—with what I believe is death itſelf, for who ever returned alive from that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous chamber!"</p>
                     <p>"With death!" ſaid Ellena, aghaſt; "Oh, heavens! how have I deſerved death?"</p>
                     <p>"That is not the queſtion, my daughter, but how you may avoid it. Within the deepeſt receſſes of our convent, is a ſtone chamber, ſecured by doors of iron, to which ſuch of the ſiſterhood as have been guilty of any heinous offence have, from time to time, been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. This condemnation admits of no reprieve; the unfortunate captive is left to languiſh in chains and darkneſs, receiving only an allowance of bread and water juſt ſufficient to prolong her ſufferings, till nature at length, ſinking under their intolerable preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, obtains refuge in death.

                     <p>The nun pauſed, but Ellena remaining rapt in ſilent thought, ſhe reſumed: "One miſerable inſtance of this ſeverity has occurred within my memory. I ſaw

the wretched victim enter that apartment—never more to quit it alive! I ſaw, alſo, her poor remains laid at reſt in the convent garden! During nearly two years ſhe languiſhed upon a bed of ſtraw, denied even the poor conſolation of converſing through the grate with ſuch of the ſiſters as pitied her; and who of us was there that did not pity her! A ſevere puniſhment was threatened to thoſe, who ſhould approach with any compaſſionate intention; thank God! I incurred it, and I endured it, alſo with ſecret triumph."</p>
                     <p>A gleam of ſatisfaction paſſed over Olivia's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance as ſhe ſpoke this; it was the ſweeteſt that Ellena had ever obſerved there. With a ſympathetic emotion, ſhe threw herſelf on the boſom of the nun, and wept; for ſome moments they were both ſilent. Olivia, at length ſaid, "Do you not believe, my child, that the officious and offended abbeſs will readily ſeize upon the circumſtance of your diſobedience, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for confining you in that fatal chamber? The wiſhes of the Marcheſa will thus ſurely be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, without the difficulty of exacting your obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the vows. Alas! I have received proof too abſolute of her intention, and that to-morrow is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned as the day of your ſacrifice; you may, perhaps, be thankful that the buſineſs of the feſtival has obliged her to defer executing the ſentence even till to-morrow."</p>
                     <p>Ellena replied only with a groan as her head ſtill drooped upon the ſhoulder of the nun; ſhe was not now heſitating whether to accept the aſſiſtance of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Olivia, who miſtook the cauſe of her ſilence, added, "Other hints I could give, which are ſtrong as they are dreadful, but I will forbear. Tell me how it is poſſible I may aſſiſt you; I am willing to incur a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:032735_0180_0FF47054D1F215F0"/>
puniſhment, in endeavouring to relieve a ſecond ſufferer."</p>
                     <p>Ellena's tears flowed faſt at this new inſtance of the nun's generoſity. "But if they ſhould diſcover you in aſſiſting me to leave the convent," ſhe ſaid in a voice convulſed by her gratitude,—"O! if they ſhould diſcover you!"—</p>
                     <p>"I can aſcertain the puniſhment," Olivia replied with firmneſs, "and do not fear to meet it."</p>
                     <p>"How nobly generous this is!" ſaid the weeping Ellena; "I ought not to ſuffer you to be thus care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of yourſelf!"</p>
                     <p>"My conduct is not wholly diſintereſted," the nun modeſty replied; "for I think I could endure any puniſhment with more fortitude than the ſickening anguiſh of beholding ſuch ſuffering as I have wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed. What are bodily pains in compariſon with the ſubtile, the exquiſite tortures of the mind! Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven knows I can ſupport my own afflictions, but not the view of thoſe of others when they are exceſſive. The inſtruments of torture I believe I could endure, if my ſpirit was invigorated with the conſciouſneſs of a generous purpoſe; but pity touches upon a nerve that vibrates inſtantly to the heart, and ſubdues reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Yes, my child, the agony of pity is keener than any other, except that of remorſe, and even in remorſe, it is, perhaps, the mingling unavailing pity, that points the ſting. But while I am indulging this egotiſm, I am, perhaps, encreaſing your danger of the ſuffering I deprecate."</p>
                     <p>Ellena, thus encouraged by the generous ſympathy of Olivia, mentioned Vivaldi's propoſed viſit of this evening; and conſulted with her on the probability of procuring admittance for herſelf to the abbeſs's parlour. Reanimated by this intelligence, Olivia ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed her to repair not only to the ſuppe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="183" facs="unknown:032735_0181_0FF49497422122B0"/>
would be admitted, among whom might probably be Vivaldi, When to this Ellena objected her dread of the abbeſs's obſervation, and of the immediate ſecluſion that would follow, Olivia ſoothed her ſears of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, by offering her the diſguiſe of a nun's veil, and promiſing not only to conduct her to the apartment, but to afford her every poſſible aſſiſtance towards her eſcape.</p>

                        </gap>," Olivia added, "it is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable you would be diſtinguiſhed, even if the ſiſters were leſs occupied by amuſement, and the abbeſs were at leiſure to ſcrutinize. As it is, you will hazard little danger of diſcovery; the Superior, if ſhe thinks of you at all, will believe that you are ſtill a priſoner in your cell, but this is an evening of too much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to her vanity for any conſideration, diſtinct from that emotion, to divide her attention. Let hope, therefore, ſupport you, my child, and do you prepare a few lines to acquaint Vivaldi with your conſent to his propoſal, and with the urgency of your circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; you may, perhaps, find an opportunity of conveying them through the grate."</p>
                     <p>They were ſtill converſing on this ſubject, when a particular chime ſounded, which Olivia ſaid ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the nuns to the concert-room; and ſhe immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haſtened for a black veil, while Ellena wrote a few lines that were neceſſary for Vivaldi.</p>

                     <p>WRAPT in Olivia's veil, Ellena deſcended to the muſic-room, and mingled with the nuns, who were aſſembled within the grate. Among the monks and pilgrims without it, were ſome ſtrangers in the uſual dreſs of the country, but ſhe did not perceive any perſon who reſembled Vivaldi; and ſhe conſidered, that, if he were preſent, he would not venture to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himſelf, while her nun's veil concealed her as effectually from him as from the lady abbeſs. It would be neceſſary, therefore, to ſeek an opportunity of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing it for a moment at the grate, an expedient, which muſt certainly expoſe her to the notice of ſtrangers.</p>
                     <p>On the entrance of the lady Abbeſs, Ellena's fear of obſervation rendered her inſenſible to every other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; ſhe fancied, that the eyes of the Superior were particularly directed upon herſelf. The veil ſeemed an inſufficient protection from their penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glances, and ſhe almoſt ſunk with terror of inſtant diſcovery.</p>
                     <p>The Abbeſs, however, paſſed on, and, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed for a few moments with the <hi>padre Abate</hi> and ſome viſitors of diſtinction, took her chair; and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance immediately opened with one of thoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and impreſſive airs, which the Italian nuns know how to give with ſo much taſte and ſweetneſs. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued even Ellena for a moment from a ſenſe of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and ſhe reſigned herſelf to the ſurrounding ſcene, of which the <hi>coup-d' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>il,</hi> was ſtriking and grand. In
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:032735_0183_0FF49498C9583640"/>
a vaulted apartment of conſiderable extent, lighted by innumerable tapers, and where even the ornaments, though pompous, partook of the ſolemn character of the inſtitution, were aſſembled about fifty nuns, who, in the intereſting habit of their order, appeared with graceful plainneſs. The delicacy of their air, and their beauty, ſoftened by the lawn that thinly veiled it, were contraſted by the ſevere majeſty of the lady Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs, who, ſeated on an elevated chair, apart from the audience, ſeemed the empreſs of the ſcene, and by the venerable figures of the Father Abate, and his attendant monks, who were arranged without that ſcreen of wire-work, extending the whole breadth of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is called the grate. Near the holy father were placed the ſtrangers of diſtinction, dreſſed in the ſplendid Neapolitan habit, whoſe gay colouring and airy elegance oppoſed well with the dark drapery of the eccleſiaſtics; their plumed hats loftily overtopping the half-cowled heads and grey locks of the monks. Nor was the contraſt of countenances leſs ſtriking; the grave, the auſtere, the ſolemn, and the gloomy, intermingling with the light, the blooming, and the debonnaire, expreſſed all the various tempers, that render life a bleſſing or a burden, and, as with the ſpell of magic, transform this world into a tranſient paradiſe or purgatory. In the back ground of the picture ſtood ſome pilgrims, with looks leſs joyous and more demure than they had worn on the road the preceding day; and among them were ſome inferior brothers and attendants of the convent. To this part of the chamber Ellena frequently directed her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but did not diſtinguiſh Vivaldi; and, though ſhe had taken a ſtation near the grate, ſhe had not courage indecorouſly to withdraw her veil before ſo many ſtrangers. And thus, if he even were in the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was not probable he would venture to come forward.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="186" facs="unknown:032735_0184_0FF47059D61778C8"/>
The concert concluded without his having been diſcovered by Ellena, and ſhe withdrew to the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where the collation was ſpread, and where the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs and her gueſts ſoon after appeared. Preſently ſhe obſerved a ſtranger, in a pilgrim's habit, ſtation him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf near the grate; his face was partly muffled in his cloak, and he ſeemed to be a ſpectator rather than a partaker of the feaſt.</p>
                     <p>Ellena, who underſtood this to be Vivaldi, was watchful for an opportunity of approaching, unſeen by the abbeſs, the place where he had fixed himſelf. Engaged in converſation with the ladies around her, the Superior ſoon favoured Ellena's wiſh, who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reached the grate, ventured to lift her veil for one inſtant. The ſtranger, letting his cloak fall, thanked her with his eyes for her condeſcenſion, and ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that he was not Vivaldi! Shocked at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation which might be given to a conduct appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ſo improper, as much as by the diſappointment, which Vivaldi's abſence occaſioned, ſhe was haſtily retiring, when another ſtranger approached with quick ſteps, whom ſhe inſtantly knew, by the grace and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his air, to be Vivaldi; but determined not to expoſe herſelf a ſecond time to the poſſibility of a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, ſhe awaited for ſome further ſignal of his identity, before ſhe diſcovered herſelf. His eyes were fixed upon her in earneſt attention for ſome moments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he drew aſide the cloak from his face. But he ſoon did ſo;—and it was Vivaldi himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Ellena, perceiving that ſhe was known, did not raiſe her veil, but advanced a few ſteps towards the grate. Vivaldi there depoſited a ſmall folded paper, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe could venture to deliver her own billet, he had retired among the crowd. As ſhe ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pped forward to ſecure his letter, ſhe obſerved a nun haſtily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the ſpot where he had laid it, and ſhe pauſed. The garment of the Recluſe wafted it from the place
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:032735_0185_0FF494A32EF91DB0"/>
where it had been partly concealed; and when Ellena perceived the nun's foot reſt upon the paper, ſhe with difficulty diſguiſed her apprehenſions.</p>
                     <p>A friar, who from without the grate addreſſed the ſiſter, ſeemed with much earneſtneſs, yet with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain air of ſecreſy, communicating ſome important in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence. The fears of Ellena ſuggeſted that he had obſerved the action of Vivaldi, and was making known his ſuſpicions; and ſhe expected, every inſtant, to ſee the nun lift up the paper, and deliver it to the abbeſs.</p>
                     <p>From this immediate apprehenſion, however, ſhe was releaſed when the ſiſter puſhed it gently aſide, without examination, a circumſtance that not leſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed than relieved her. But, when the conference broke up, the friar, haſtily retreating among the crowd, diſappeared from the apartment, and the nun approached and whiſpered the Superior, all her terrors were renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. She ſcarcely doubted that Vivaldi was detected, and that his letter was deſignedly left where it had been depoſited, for the purpoſe of alluring her to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray herſelf. Trembling, diſmayed, and almoſt ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with apprehenſion, ſhe watched the countenance of the Abbeſs, while the nun addreſſed her, and thought ſhe read her own fate in the frown that appeared there.</p>
                     <p>Whatever might be the intentions or the directions of the Superior, no active meaſure was at preſent em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; the Recluſe, having received an anſwer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired quietly among the ſiſters, and the Abbeſs reſumed her uſual manner. Ellena, however, ſuppoſing ſhe was now obſerved, did not dare to ſeize the paper, though ſhe believed it contained momentous informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and feared that the time was now eſcaping which might facilitate her deliverance. Whenever ſhe ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to look round, the eyes of the Abbeſs ſeemed pointed upon her, and ſhe judged from the poſition of the nun, for the veil concealed her face, that ſhe alſo was vigilantly regarding her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="188" facs="unknown:032735_0186_0FF4705B913303E0"/>
Above an hour had elapſed in this ſtate of anxious ſuſpenſe, when the collation concluded, and the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly broke up; during the general buſtle of which, Ellena ventured to the grate, and ſecured the paper. As ſhe concealed it in her robe, ſhe ſcarcely dared to enquire by a haſty glance whether ſhe had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and would have withdrawn immediately to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the contents, had ſhe not perceived, at the ſame inſtant, the Abbeſs quitting the apartment. On look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round for the nun, Ellena diſcovered that ſhe was gone.</p>
                     <p>Ellena followed diſtantly in the Abbeſs's train; and, as ſhe drew nearer to Olivia, gave a ſignal, and paſſed on to her cell. There, once more alone, and having ſecured the door, ſhe ſat down to read Vivaldi's billet, trying to command her impatience, and to underſtand the lines, over which her ſight rapidly moved, when, in the eagerneſs of turning over the paper, the lamp dropt from her trembling hand and expired. Her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs now nearly reached deſpair. To go forth into the convent for a light was utterly impracticable, ſince it would betray that ſhe was no longer a priſoner, and not only would Olivia ſuffer from a diſcovery of the indulgence ſhe had granted, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t ſhe herſelf would be immediately confined. Her only hope reſted upon Olivia's arrival before it might be too late to practiſe the inſtructions of Vivaldi, if, indeed they were ſtill practicable; and ſhe liſtened with intenſe ſolicitude for an approaching footſtep, while ſhe yet h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ld, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of its contents, the billet, that probably would decide her fate. A thouſand times ſhe turned about the eventful paper, and endeavoured to trace the lines with her ſinger, and to gueſs their import, thus enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped in myſtery; while ſhe experienced all the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous torture that the conſciouſneſs of having in her hand the information, on a timely knowledge of which her life, perhaps, depended, without being able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, could inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>

Preſently ſhe heard advancing ſteps, and a light gleamed from the paſſage before ſhe conſidered they might be ſome other than Olivia's; and that it was pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to conceal the billet ſhe held. The conſideration, however, came too late to be acted upon; for before the ruſtling paper was diſpoſed of, a perſon entered the cell, and Ellena beheld her friend. Pale, trembling, and ſilent, ſhe took the lamp from the nun, and eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly running over Vivaldi's note, learned that at the time it was written, brother Jeronimo was in waiting without the gate of the nun's garden, where Vivaldi deſigned to join him immediately, and conduct her by a private way beyond the walls. He added, that horſes were ſtationed at the foot of the mountain, to convey her wherever ſhe ſhould judge proper; and conjured her to be expeditious, ſince other circumſtances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the univerſal engagement of the Recluſes, were at that moment particularly favorable to an eſcape.</p>
                     <p>Ellena, deſponding and appalled, gave the paper to Olivia, requeſting ſhe would read it haſtily, and adviſe her how to act. It was now an hour and a half ſince Vivaldi had ſaid, that ſucceſs depended upon expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that he had probably watched at the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed place; in ſuch an interval, how many circumſtances might have occurred to deſtroy every poſſibility of a retreat, which it was certain the engagement of the Abbeſs and the ſiſters no longer favoured.</p>
                     <p>The generous Olivia, having read the billet, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took of all her young friend's diſtreſs, and was as willing, as Ellena was anxious, to dare every danger for the chance of obtaining deliverance.</p>
                     <p>Ellena could feel gratitude for ſuch goodneſs even at this moment of agonizing apprehenſion. After a pauſe of deep conſideration, Olivia ſaid, "in every a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the convent we are now liable to meet ſome of the nuns; but my veil, though thin, has hitherto protected you, and we muſt hope it may ſtill aſſiſt
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:032735_0188_0FF4705FD6516CB8"/>
your purpoſe. It will be neceſſary, however, to paſs through the refectory, where ſuch of the ſiſters as did not partake of the colation, are aſſembled at ſupper, and will remain ſo till the firſt mattin calls them to the chapel. If we wait till then, I fear it will be to no purpoſe to go at all."</p>
                     <p>Ellena's fears perfectly agreed with thoſe of Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via; and entreating that another moment might not be loſt in heſitation, and that ſhe would lead the way to the nun's garden, they quitted the cell together.</p>
                     <p>Several of the ſiſters paſſed them, as they deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the refectory, but without particularly noticing Ellena; who, as ſhe drew near that alarming apartment, wrapt her viel cloſer, and leaned with heavier preſſure upon the arm of her faithful friend. At the door they were met by the Abbeſs, who had been overlooking the nuns aſſembled at ſupper, and miſſing Olivia had enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for her. Ellena ſhrunk back to allude obſervation and to let the Superior paſs; but Olivia was obliged to anſwer to the ſummons, Having, however, unvei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led herſelf, ſhe was permitted to proceed; and Ellena, who had mingled with the crowd that ſurrounded the Abbeſs, and thus eſcaped detection, followed Olivia with faltering ſteps, through the refectory. The nuns were luckily too much engaged by the entertainment at this moment, to look round them, and the fugitive reached, unſuſpected, an oppoſite door.</p>
                     <p>In the hall, to which they deſcended, the adventurers were frequently croſſed by ſervants bearing diſhes from the refectory to the kitchen; and, at the very moment when they were oppening the door, that led into the garden, a ſiſter, who had obſerved them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded whether thy had yet heard the mattin-bell, ſince they were going towards the chapel.</p>
                     <p>Terrified at this critical interruption, Ellena preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Olivia's arm, in ſignal of ſilence, and was haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward, when the latter, more prudent, pauſed,
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:032735_0189_0FF46EAE3201D970"/>
and calmly anſwering the queſtion, was then ſuffered to proceed.</p>
                     <p>As they croſſed the garden towards the gate, Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's anxiety leſt Vivaldi ſhould have been compelled to leave it, encreaſed ſo much, that ſhe had ſcarcely power to proceed. "O if my ſtrength ſhould fail before I reach it!" ſhe ſaid ſoftly to Olivia, "or if I ſhould reach it too late!"</p>
                     <p>Olivia tried to cheer her, and pointed out the gate, on which the moonlight fell; "At the end of this walk only," ſaid Olivia, "ſee!—where the ſhadows of the trees open, is our goal."</p>
                     <p>Encouraged by the view of it, Ellena fled with lighter ſteps along the alley; but the gate ſeemed to mock her approach, and to retreat before her. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue overtook her in this long alley, before ſhe could overtake the ſpot ſo anxiouſly ſought, and, breathleſs and exhauſted, ſhe was once more compelled to ſtop, and once more in the agony of terror exclaimed—"O, if my ſtrength ſhould fail before I reach it!—O, if I ſhould drop even while it is in my view."</p>
                     <p>The pauſe of a moment enabled her to proceed, and ſhe ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>pped not again till ſhe arrived at the gate; when Olivia ſuggeſted the prudence of aſcertaining who was without, and of receiving an anſwer to the ſignal, which Vivaldi had propoſed, before they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to make themſelves known. She then ſtruck upon the wood, and, in the anxious pauſe that followed whiſpering voices were diſtinctly heard from without, but no ſignal ſpoke in reply to the nun's.</p>
                     <p>"We are betrayed!" ſaid Ellena ſoftly, "but I will know the worſt at once;" and ſhe repeated the ſignal, when to her unſpeakable joy, it was anſwered by three ſmart raps upon the gate. Olivia, more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtful, would have checked the ſudden hope of her friend, till ſome farther proof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ad appeared that it was Vivaldi who waited without, but her precaution came
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:032735_0190_0FF47062566FDDB0"/>
too late; a key already grated in the lock; the door opened, and two perſons muffled in their garments ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at it. Ellena was haſtily retreating, when a well known voice recalled her, and ſhe perceived, by the rays of a half-hooded lamp, which Jeronimo held, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi.</p>
                     <p>"O heaven!" he exclaimed, in a voice tremu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous with joy, as he took her hand, "is it poſſible that you are again my own! If you could but know what I have ſuffered during this laſt hour?"—Then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Olivia, he drew back till Ellena expreſſed her deep ſenſe of obligation to the nun.</p>
                     <p>"We have no time to looſe," ſaid Jeronimo ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenly; "we have ſtayed too long alr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>dy, as you will find, perhaps."</p>
                     <p>"Farewel, dear, Ellena!" ſaid Olivia, "may the protection of heaven never leave you!"</p>
                     <p>The fears of Ellena now gave way to affectionate ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as weeping on the boſom of the nun; ſhe ſaid "farewel; O farewel, my dear, my tender friend! I muſt never, never ſee you more, but I ſhall always love you; and you have promiſed, that I ſhall hear from you; remember the convent della Pieta!"</p>
                     <p>"You ſhould have ſettled this matter within," ſaid Jeronimo, "we have been here theſe two hours al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready."</p>
                     <p>"Ah Ellena!" ſaid Vivaldi, as he gently diſengag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her from the nun, "do I then hold only the ſecond place in your heart?"</p>
                     <p>Ellena, as ſhe diſmiſſed her tears, replied with a ſmile more eloquent than words; and when ſhe had again and again bade adieu to Olivia, ſhe gave him her hand, and quitted the gate.</p>
                     <p>"It is moonlight," obſerved Vivaldi to Jeronimo, "your lamp is uſeleſs, and may betray us."</p>
                     <p>"It will be neceſſary in the church," replied Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo, "and in ſome circuitous avenues we muſt paſs,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:032735_0191_0FF494A7C6FC5098"/>
for I dare not lead you out through the great gates, Signor, as you well know."</p>
                     <p>"Lead on, then," replied Vivaldi, and they reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of the cypreſs walks, that extended to the church; but, before they entered it, Ellena pauſed and looked back to the garden gate, that ſhe might ſee Olivia once more again. The nun was ſtill there, and Ellena perceived her faintly in the moonlight, waving her hand in ſignal of a laſt adieu. Ellena's heart was full; ſhe wept, and lingered, and returned the ſignal, till the gentle violence of Vivaldi withdrew her from the ſpot.</p>
                     <p>"I envy your friend thoſe tears," ſaid he "and feel jealous of the tenderneſs that excites them. Weep no more, my Ellena."</p>
                     <p>"If you knew her worth," replied Ellena, "and the obligation I owe her!"—Her voice was loſt in ſighs, and Vivaldi only preſſed her hand in ſilence.</p>
                     <p>As they traverſed the gloomy walk, that led to the church, Vivaldi ſaid, "Are you certain, father, that not any of the brothers are doing penance at the ſhrines in our way."</p>
                     <p>"Doing penance on a feſtival, Signor! they are more likely, by this time, to be taking down the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments."</p>
                     <p>"That would be equally unfortunate for us," ſaid Vivaldi; "cannot we avoid the church, father?"</p>
                     <p>Jeronimo aſſured him, that this was impoſſible; and they immediately entered one of its lonely aiſles, where he unhooded the lamp, for the tapers, which had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſplendor, at an earlier hour, to the numerous ſhrines, had expired, except thoſe at the high altar, which were ſo remote, that their rays faded into twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light long before they reached the part of the church where the fugitives paſſed. Here and there indeed, a dying lamp ſhot a tremulous gleam upon the ſhrine below, and vaniſhed again, ſerving to mark the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:032735_0192_0FF47064108E6358"/>
in the long perſpective of arches, rather than to enlighten the gloomy ſolitude; but no ſound, not even of a whiſper, ſtole along the pavement.</p>
                     <p>They croſſed to a door communicating with the court, and with the rock, which enſhrined the image of <hi>our Lady of mount Carmel.</hi> There the ſudden glare of tapers iſſuing from the cave, alarmed the fugitives, who had begun to retreat, when Jeronimo, ſtepping forward to examine the place, aſſured them, there was no ſymptom of any perſon being within, and that lights burned day and night around the ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Revived by this explanation, they followed into the cave, where their conductor opened a part of the wire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work encloſing the ſaint, and led them to the extrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the vault, ſunk deep within which appeared a ſmall door. While Ellena trembled with apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Jeronimo applied a key, and they perceived, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the door, a narrow paſſage winding away into the rock. The monk was leading on, but Vivaldi, who had the ſuſpicions of Ellena, pauſed at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and demanded whither he was conducting them.</p>
                     <p>"To the place of your <hi>deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

"I have given myſelf to your guidance," he ſaid, "and have confided to you what is dearer to me than exiſtence. Your life," pointing to the ſhort ſword concealed beneath his pilg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Do you menace me!" replied the brother, his countenance darkening. "Of what ſervice would be my death to you? Do you not know that every bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the convent would riſe to avenge i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"I know only that I will make ſure of one traitor,

if there be one," ſaid Vivaldi, "and defend this lady againſt your hoſt of monks; and, ſince you alſo know this, proceed accordingly."</p>
                     <p>At this inſtant it occuring to Ellena, that the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in queſtion probably led to the priſon chamber, which Olivia had deſcribed as ſituated within ſome deep receſs of the convent, and that Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>onimo had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly betrayed them, ſhe refuſed to go further. "If your purpoſe is honeſt," ſaid ſhe, "why do you not conduct us through ſome direct gate of the convent? why are we brought into theſe ſubterraneous laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths?"</p>
                     <p>"There is no direct gate but that of the portal," Jeronimo replied, "and this is the only other avenue leading beyond the walls." "And why can we not go out through the portal?" Vivaldi aſked.</p>
                     <p>"Becuſe it is beſet with pilgrims, and lay brothers," replied Jeronimo. "And though you might paſs them ſafely enough, what is to become of the lady? But all this you knew before, and was willing enough to truſt me, then. The paſſage we are entering opens upon the cliffs, at ſome diſtance. I have run hazard enough already, and will waſte no more time; for if you do not chuſe to go forward, I will leave you, and you may act as you pleaſe."</p>
                     <p>He concluded with a laugh of deriſion, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locking the door, when Vivaldi, alarmed for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable conſequence of his reſentment, and ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſured by the indifference he diſcovered as to their purſuing the avenue or not, endeavoured to appeaſe him, as well as to encourage Ellena; and he ſucceeded in both.</p>
                     <p>As he fellowed in ſilence through the gloomy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, his doubts were, however, not ſo wholly van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, but that he was prepared for attack, and while he ſupported Ellena with one hand, he held his ſword in the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="196" facs="unknown:032735_0194_0FF47065C8849A60"/>
The avenue was of conſiderable length, and before they reached its extremity, they heard muſic from a diſtance, winding along the rocks.—"Hark!" cried Ellena, "Whence come thoſe ſounds? Liſten!"</p>
                     <p>"From the cave we have left," replied Jeronimo, "and it is midnight by that; it is the laſt chaunt of the pilgrims at the ſhrine of our Lady. Make haſte, Signor, I ſhall be called for."</p>
                     <p>The fugitives now perceived, that all retreat was cut off, and that, if they had lingered only a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments longer in the cave, they ſhould have been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed by thoſe devotees, ſome one of whom, however, it appeared poſſible might wander into this avenue, and ſtill interrupt their eſcape. When Vivaldi told his apprehenſions, Jeromino, with an arch ſneer, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed there was no danger of that, "for the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage," he added, "is known only to the brothers of the convent."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi's doubts vaniſhed when he further under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that the avenue led only from the cliffs without to the cave, and was uſed for the purpoſe of conveying ſecretly to the ſhrine, ſuch articles as were judged neceſſary to excite the ſuperſtitious wonder of the devotees.</p>
                     <p>While he proceeded in thoughtful ſilence, a diſtant chime ſounded hollowly through the chambers of the rock. "The mattin-bell ſtrikes!" ſaid Jeronimo, in ſeeming alarm, "I am ſummoned. Signora, quicken your ſteps;" an unneceſſary requeſt, for Ellena al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſſed with her utmoſt ſpeed; and ſhe now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced on perceiving a door in the remote winding of the paſſage, which ſhe believed would emancipate her from the convent. But, as ſhe advanced, the avenue appeared extended beyond it; and the door, which ſtood a little open allowed her a glimpſe of a chamber in the cliff, duſkily lighted.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, alarmed by the light, enquired, when he
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:032735_0195_0FF494B2DEC2D8F0"/>
had paſſed, whether any perſon was in the chamber, and received an equivocal anſwer from Jeronimo, who, however, ſoon after pointed to an arched gate that terminated the avenue. They proceeded with lighter ſteps, for hope now cheared their hearts, and, on reaching the gate, all apprehenſion vaniſhed. Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo gave the lamp to Vivaldi, while he began to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar and unlock the door, and Vivaldi had prepared to reward the brother for his fidelity, before they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the door refuſed to yield. A dreadful agitation ſeized on Vivaldi. Jeronimo turning round, coolly ſaid, "I fear we are betrayed; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond lock is ſhot! I have only the key of the firſt."</p>
                     <p>"We are betrayed," ſaid Vivaldi, in a reſolute tone, "but do not ſuppoſe that your diſſimulation conceals you. I underſtand by whom we are betrayed.

                     <p>"Your wily explanation, brother, may ſerve you for an inferior occaſion, but not on this," replied Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, "either, therefore, uncloſe the gate, or prepare for the worſt. You are not now to learn, that, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſlightly I may eſtimate my own life, I will never abandon this lady to the horrors which your commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity have already prepared for her."</p>
                     <p>Ellena, ſummoning her fleeting ſpirits, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to calm the indignation of Vivaldi, and to prevent the conſequence of his ſuſpicions, as well as to prevail
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:032735_0196_0FF4706993634D78"/>
with Jeronimo to unfaſten the gate. Her efforts were, however, followed by a long altercation; but, at length, the art or the innocence of the brother, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed Vivaldi, who now endeavoured to force the gate, while Jeronimo in vain repreſented its ſtrength, and the certain ruin that muſt fall upon himſelf, if it ſhould be diſcovered he had concurred in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
                     <p>The gate was immoveable; but, as no other chance of eſcaping appeared, Vivaldi was not eaſily prevailed with to deſiſt; all poſſibility of retreating too was gone, ſince the church and the cave were now crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with devotees, attending the mattin ſervice.</p>
                     <p>Jeronimo, however, ſeemingly did not deſpair of effecting their releaſe, but he acknowledged that they would probably be compelled to remain concealed in this gloomy avenue all night, and perhaps the next day. At length, it was agreed, that he ſhould return to the church, to examine whether a poſſibility remained of the fugitives paſſing unobſerved to the great portal; and, having conducted them back to the chamber, of which they had taken a paſſing glimpſe, he proceeded to the ſhrine.</p>
                     <p>For a conſiderable time after his departure, they were not without hope; but, their confidence dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing as his delay encreaſed, their uncertainty at length became terrible; and it was only for the ſake of Vivaldi, from whom ſhe ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rupulouſly concealed all knowledge of the particular fate, which ſhe was aware muſt await her in the convent, that Ellena appeared to endure it with calmneſs. Notwithſtanding the plauſibility of Jeronimo, ſuſpicion of his treachery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned upon her mind. The cold and earthy air of this chamber was like that of a ſepulchre; and when ſhe looked round, it appeared exactly to correſpond with the deſcription given by Olivia of the priſon where the nun had languiſhed and expired. It was
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:032735_0197_0FF494B4667A0D48"/>
walled and valuted with the rock, had only one ſmall grated aperture in the roof to admit air, and contained no furniture, except one table, a bench, and the lamp, which dimly ſhewed the apartment. That a lamp ſhould be found burning in a place ſo remote and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, amazed her ſtill more when ſhe recollected the aſſertion of Jeronimo,—that even holy ſteps ſeldom paſſed this way; and when ſhe conſidered alſo, that he had expreſſed no ſurpriſe at a circumſtance, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own aſſertion, ſo unuſual. Again it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that ſhe had been, betrayed into the very pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, deſigned for her by the Abbeſs; and the horror, occaſioned by this ſuppoſition was ſo great, that ſhe was on the point of diſcloſing it to Vivaldi, but an apprehenſion of the diſtraction, into which his deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate courage might precipitate him, reſtrained her.</p>
                     <p>While theſe conſiderations occupied Ellena, and it appeared that any certainty would be leſs painful than this ſuſpenſe, ſhe frequently looked round the chamber in ſearch of ſome object, which might contradict or confirm her ſuſpicion, that this was the death-room of the unfortunate nun. No ſuch circumſtance appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but as her eyes glanced, with almoſt phrenzied <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>agerneſs, ſhe perceived ſomething ſhadowy in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote corner of the floor; and on approaching, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered what ſeemed a dreadful hieroglyphic, a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſs of ſtraw, in which ſhe thought ſhe beheld the death-bed of the miſerable recluſe; nay more, that the impreſſion it ſtill retained, was that which her form had left there.</p>
                     <p>While Vivaldi was yet entreating her to explain the occaſion of the horror ſhe betrayed, the attention of each was withdrawn by a hollow ſigh, that roſe near them, Ellena caught unconſciouſly the arm of Vivaldi, and liſtened, aghaſt, for a return of the ſound, but all remained ſtill.</p>
                     <p>"It ſurely was not fancied!" ſaid Vivaldi, after a long pauſe, "you heard it alſo?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="200" facs="unknown:032735_0198_0FF495219BC0C068"/>
"I did!" replied Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"It was a ſigh, was it not!" he added.</p>
                     <p>"O yes, ſuch a ſigh!"</p>
                     <p>"Some perſon is concealed near us," obſerved Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, looking round; but be not alarmed, Ellena, I have a ſword."</p>
                     <p>"A ſword! alas! you know not—But hark! there, again!"</p>
                     <p>"That was very near us!" ſaid Vivaldi. "This lamp burns ſo fickly!"—and he held it high, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to penetrate the furtheſt gloom of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. "Hah! who goes there?" he cried, and ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſuddenly forward; but no perſon appeared, and a ſilence as of the tomb, returned.</p>
                     <p>"If you are in ſorrow, ſpeak!" Vivaldi, at length, ſaid; "from fellow-ſufferers you will meet with ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy. If your deſigns are evils—tremble, for you ſhall find I am deſperate."</p>
                     <p>Still no anſwer was returned, and he carried for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the lamp to the oppoſite end of the chamber, where he perceived a ſmall door in the rock. At the ſame inſtant he heard from within, a low tremulous ſound, as of a perſon in prayer, or in agony. He pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſſed againſt the door, which, to his ſurpriſe, yielded immediately, and diſcovered a figure kneeling before a crucific, with an attention ſo wholly engaged, as not to obſerve the preſence of a ſtranger, till Vivaldi ſpoke. The perſon then roſe from his knees, and turning, ſhewed the ſilver temples and pale features of an aged monk. The mind and ſorrowful character of the countenance, and the lambent luſtre of his eyes, which ſeemed ſtill to retain ſomewhat of the ſire of genius, intereſted Vivaldi, and encouraged Ellena, who had followed him.</p>
                     <p>An unaffected ſurpriſe appeared in the air of the monk; but Vivaldi, notwithſtanding the intereſting benignity of his countenance, feared to anſwer his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:032735_0199_0FF495FF785C8EF0"/>
till the father hinted to him, that an explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was neceſſary, even to his own ſafety. Encouraged by his manner, rather than intimidated by his hint, and perceiving that his ſituation was deſperate, Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di confided to the friar ſome partial knowledge of his embarraſſment.</p>
                     <p>While he ſpoke, the father liſtened with deep at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, looked with compaſſion alternately upon him and Ellena; and ſome harraſſing objection ſeemed to contend with the pity which urged him to aſſiſt the ſtrangers. He enquired how long Jeronimo had been abſent, and ſhook his head ſignificantly when he learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the gate of the avenue was faſtened by a double lock. "You are betrayed my children," ſaid he, "you have truſted with the ſimplicity of youth, and the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of age has deceived you."</p>
                     <p>The terrible conviction affected Ellena to tears; and Vivaldi, ſcarcely able to command the indignation which a view of ſuch treachery excited, was unable to offer her any conſolation.</p>
                     <p>"You, my daughter, I remember to have ſeen in the church this morning," obſerved the friar; "I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member too, that you proteſted againſt the vows you were brought thither to ſeal. Alas! my child were you aware of the conſequence of ſuch a proceeding?"</p>
                     <p>"I had only a choice of evils," Ellena replied.</p>
                     <p>"Holy father," ſaid Vivaldi, "I will not believe, that you are one of thoſe who either aſſiſted in or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the perſecution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of innocence. If you were acquainted with the misfortunes of this lady, you would pity, and ſave her; but there is now no time for detail; and I can only conjure you, by every ſacred conſideration, to aſſiſt her to leave the convent!

                        </gap> her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors—O, holy father, if you knew all this!"—Vivaldi was unable to proceed.</p>
                     <p>The friar again regarded Ellena with compaſſion, but ſtill in thoughtful ſilence. "All this may be very true," at length he ſaid, "but"—and he heſitated.</p>
                     <p>"I underſtand you, father," ſaid Vivaldi—"you require proof; but how can proof be adduced here? You muſt rely upon the honour of my word. And, if you are inclined to aſſiſt us, it muſt be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly!—while you heſitate, we are loſt. Even now I think I hear the footſteps of Jeronimo."</p>
                     <p>He ſtepped ſoftly to the door of the chamber, but all was yet ſtill. The friar, too, liſtened, but he alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated; while Ellena, with claſped hands and a look of eager ſupplication and terror, awaited his deciſion.</p>
                     <p>"No one is approaching," ſaid Vivaldi, "it is not yet too late!—Good father!—If you would ſerve us, diſpatch."</p>
                     <p>"Poor innocent!" ſaid the friar, half to himſelf, "in this chamber—in this fatal place!"—</p>
                     <p>"In this chamber!" exclaimed Ellena, anticipat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his meaning. "It was in this chamber, then, that a nun was ſuffered to periſh! and I, no doubt, am conducted hither to undergo a ſimilar fate!"</p>
                     <p>"In this chamber!" re-echoed Vivaldi, in a voice of deſperation. "Holy father, if you are indeed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to aſſiſt us, let us act this inſtant; the next, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, may render your beſt intentions unavailing!"</p>
                     <p>The friar, who had regarded Ellena while ſhe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the nun, with the utmoſt ſurpriſe, now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew his attention; a few tears fell on his cheek, but he haſtily dried them, and ſeemed ſtruggling to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſome grief, that was deep in his heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="203" facs="unknown:032735_0201_0FF494BFC1B9B238"/>
Vivaldi, finding that entreaty had no power to haſten his deciſion, and expecting every moment to hear the approach of Jeronimo, paced the chamber in agonizing perturbation, now pauſing at the door to liſten, and then calling, though almoſt hopeleſsly, upon the humanity of the friar. While Ellena, looking round the room in ſhuddering horror, repeatedly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "On this very ſpot! in this very chamber! O what ſufferings have theſe walls witneſſed! what are they yet to witneſs!"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi now endeavoured to ſoothe the ſpirits of Ellena, and again urged the friar to embrace this cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical moment in ſaving her; "O heaven!" ſaid he, "if ſhe is now diſcovered, her fate is certain!"</p>
                     <p>"I dare not ſay what that fate would be," inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the father, "or what my own, ſhould I conſent to aſſiſt you; but, though I am old, I have not quite forgotten to feel for others! They may oppreſs the few remaining years of my life, but the blooming days of youth ſhould flouriſh; and they ſhall flouriſh, my children, if my power can aid you. Follow me to the gate; we will ſee whether my key cannot unfaſten all the locks that hold it."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi and Ellena immediately followed the feeble ſteps of the old man, who frequently ſtopped to liſten whether Jeronimo, or any of the brothers, to whom the latter might have betrayed Ellena's ſituation, were approaching; but not an echo wandered along the lonely avenue, till they reached the gate, when diſtant footſteps beat upon the ground.</p>
                     <p>"They are approaching, father!" whiſpered El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena. "O, if the key ſhould not open th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>While the friar, with trembling hands, applied the
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:032735_0202_0FF4952D77EEBDA8"/>
key, Vivaldi endeavoured at once to aſſiſt him, and to encourage Ellena.</p>
                     <p>The locks gave way, and the gate opened at once upon the moonlight mountains. Ellena heard once more, with the joy of liberty, the midnight breeze paſſing among the penſile branches of the palms, that loftily overſhadowed a rude platform before the gate, and ruſtling with fainter ſound among the pendent ſhrubs of the ſurrounding cliffs.</p>
                     <p>"There is no leiſure for thanks, my children," ſaid the friar, obſerving they were about to ſpeak, "I will faſten the gate, and endeavour to delay your purſuers, that you may have time to eſcape. My bleſſing go with you!"</p>
                     <p>Ellena and Vivaldi had ſcarcely a moment to bid him "farewel!" before he cloſed the door, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, taking her arm, was haſtening towards the place where he had ordered Paulo to wait with the horſes, when on turning an angle of the convent wall, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a long train of pilgrims iſſuing forth from the portal, at a little diſtance.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi drew back; yet dreading every moment, that he lingered near the moneſtery, to hear the voice of Jeronimo, or other perſons, from the avenue, he was ſometimes inclined to proceed at any hazard. The only practicable path leading to the baſe of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, however, was now occupied by theſe devotees, and to mingle with them was little leſs than certain deſtruction. A bright moonlight ſhewed diſtincttly every figure, that moved in the ſcene, and the fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives kept within the ſhadow of the walls, till, warned by an approaching footſtep, they croſſed to the feet of the cliffs that roſe beyond ſome palmy hillocks on the right, whoſe duſky receſſes promiſed a temporary ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. As they paſſed with ſilent ſteps along the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rock, the tranquility of the landſcape below afforded
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:032735_0203_0FF494C149ACA388"/>
an affecting contraſt with the tumult and alarm of their minds.</p>
                     <p>Being now at ſome diſtance from the monaſtery, they reſted under the ſhade of the cliffs; till the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of devotees, which were traced deſcending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the thickets and hollows of the mountain, ſhould be ſufficiently remote. Often they looked back to the convent, expecting to ſee lights iſſue from the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, or to the portal; and attended in mute anxiety for the ſullen murmurs of purſuit; but none came on the breeze; nor did any gleaming lamp betray the ſteps of a ſpy.</p>
                     <p>Releaſed, at length, from immediate apprehenſion, Ellena liſtened to the mattin-hymn of the pilgrims, as it came upon the ſtill air and aſcended towards the cloudleſs heavens. Not a ſound mingled with the holy ſtrain, and even in the meaſured pauſe of voices only the trembling of the foliage above was diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The reſponſes, as they ſoftened away in diſtance, and ſwelled again on the wafting breeze, appeared like the muſic of ſpirits, watching by night upon the ſummits of the mountains, and anſwering each other in celeſtial airs, as they walk their high boundary, and overlook the ſleeping world.</p>
                     <p>"How often, Ellena, at this hour," ſaid Vivaldi, "have I lingered round your dwelling conſoled by the conſciouſneſs of being near you! Within thoſe walls, I have ſaid, ſhe repoſes; they encloſed my world, all without is to me a de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Vivaldi forgot, in the anxiety of a ſtronger intereſt, the delicate ſilence he had reſolved to impoſe upon himſelf, till Ellena ſhould be in a place of ſafety.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="206" facs="unknown:032735_0204_0FF4952F046FAE60"/>
"This is not a moment," ſhe replied, with heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, "for converſation; our ſituation is yet perilous, we tremble on the very brink of danger."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi immediately roſe; into what imminent danger," ſaid he, "had my folly nearly precipitated you! We are lingering in this alarming neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, when that feeble ſtrain indicates the pilgrims to be ſufficiently remote to permit us to proceed!"</p>
                     <p>As he ſpoke, they deſcended cautiouſly among the cliffs, often looking back to the convent, where, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, no light appeared, except what the moon ſhed over the ſpires and tall windows of its cathedral. For a moment, Ellena fancied ſhe ſaw a taper in her favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite turret, and a belief, that the nuns, perhaps the Abbeſs herſelf, were ſearching for her there, renewed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>er terror and her ſpeed. But the rays were only thoſe of the moon, ſtriking through oppoſite caſements of the chamber; and the fugitives reached the baſe of the mountain without further alarm, where Paulo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with horſes. "Ah! Signor mio," ſaid the ſervant, "I am glad to ſee you alive and merry; I began to fear, by the length of your ſtay, that the monks had clapped you up to do penance for life. How glad I am to ſee you Maeſtro!"</p>
                     <p>"Not more ſo than I am to ſee you, good Paulo. But where is the pilgrim's cloak I bade you provide?"</p>
                     <p>Paulo diſplayed it, and Vivaldi, having wrapt it round Ellena, and placed her on horſeback, they took the road towards Naples, Ellena, deſigning to take refuge in the convent della Pieta. Vivaldi, however, apprehending that their enemies would ſeek them on this road, propoſed leaving it as ſoon as practicable, and reaching the neighbourhood of villa Altieri by a circuitous way.</p>
                     <p>They ſoon arrived at the tremendous paſs, through which Ellena had approached the monaſtery, and whoſe horrors were conſiderably heightened at this

duſky hour, for the moonlight fell only partially upon the deep barriers of the gorge, and frequently the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice, with the road on its brow, was entirely ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by other cliffs and woody points that roſe above it. But Paulo, whoſe ſpirits ſeldom owned the influence of local ſcenery, jogged merrily along, frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulating himſelf and his maſter on their eſcape, and carolling briſkly to the echoes of the rocks, till Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, apprehenſive for the conſequence of this loud gaiety deſired him to deſiſt.</p>
                     <p>"Ah Signor mio! I muſt obey you," ſaid he, "but my heart was never ſo full in my life; and I would fain ſing, to unburden it of ſome of this joy. That ſcrape we got into in that dungeon there, at what's the name of the place? was bad enough, but it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this, becauſe here I was left out of it; and you, Maeſtro, might have been murdered again and again, while I, thinking of nothing at all, was quietly airing myſelf on the mountain by moonlight.—But what is that yonder in the ſky, Signor?

                     <p>Vivaldi looked forward, and Ellena perceived the Alpine bridge, ſhe had formerly croſſed with ſo much alarm, in the moonlight perſpective, airily ſuſpended between tremendous cliffs, with the river far below, tumbling down the rocky chaſm.

                     <p>"Well, to be ſure! exclaimed Paulo, "to ſee what

curioſity will do! If there are not ſome people have found their way up to the bridge already."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi now perceived figures upon the ſlender arch, and, as their indiſtinct forms glided in the moonſhine, other emotions than thoſe of wonder diſturbed him, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſe might be pilgrims going to the ſhrine of our Lady, and who would give information of his route. No poſſibility, however, appeared of avoiding them, for the precipices that roſe immediately above, and fell below, forbade all excurſion, and the road itſelf was ſo narrow, as ſcarcely to admit of two horſes paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing each other.</p>
                     <p>"They are all off the bridge now, and without having broken their necks, perhaps!" ſaid Paulo, "where, I wonder, will they go next! Why ſurely, Signor, this road does not lead to the bridge yonder; we are not going to pick our way in the air too? The roar of thoſe waters has made my head dizzy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; and the rocks here are as dark as midnight, and ſeem ready to tumble upon one; they are enough to make one deſpair to look at them; you need not have checked my mirth, Signor."</p>
                     <p>"I would fain check your loquacity," replied Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi. "Do, good Paulo, be ſilent and circumſpect; thoſe people may be near us, though we do not yet ſee them."</p>
                     <p>"The road does lead to the bridge then, Signor!" ſaid Paulo dolorouſly. "And ſee! there they are again; winding round that rock, and coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us."</p>
                     <p>"Huſh! they are pilgrims," whiſpered Vivaldi, "we will linger under the ſhade of theſe rocks while they paſs. Remember Paulo, that a ſingle indiſcreet wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"You are obeyed, Signor."</p>
                     <p>The fugitives drew up cloſe under the cliffs, and
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:032735_0207_0FF494C45790AB48"/>
proceeded ſlowly, while the words of the devotees, as they advanced, became audible.</p>
                     <p>"It gives one ſome comfort, ſaid Paulo, "to hear cheerful voices, in ſuch a place as this. Bleſs their merry hearts! theirs ſeems a pilgrimane of pleaſure; but they will be demure enough, I warrant, by and by. I wiſh I"—</p>
                     <p>"Paulo have you ſo ſoon forgot?" ſaid Vivaldi ſharply.</p>
                     <p>The devotees, on perceiving the travellers, became ſuddenly ſilent; till he who appeared to be the Father Director, as they paſſed ſaid "Hail! in the name of <hi>Our Lady of mount Carmel!</hi>" and they repeated the ſalutation in chorus.</p>
                     <p>"Hail!" replied Vivaldi, "the firſt maſs is over," and he paſſed on.</p>
                     <p>"But if you make haſte, you may come in for the ſecond," ſaid Paulo, jogging after.</p>
                     <p>"You have juſt left the ſhrine, then?" ſaid one of the party, "and can tell us"—"Poor pilgrims, like yourſelves," replied Paulo, "and can tell as little. Good morrow, fathers, yonder peeps the dawn!"</p>
                     <p>He came up with his maſter, who had hurried for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with Ellena, and who now ſeverely reproved his indiſcretion; while the voices of the Carmelites, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mattin-hymn, ſunk away among the rocks, and the quietneſs of ſolitude returned.</p>
                     <p>"Thank heaven! we are quit of this adventure," ſaid Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"And now we have only the bridge to get over," rejoined Paulo, "and, hope, we ſhall all be ſafe."</p>
                     <p>They were now at the entrance of it; as they paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the trembling planks, and looked up the glen, a party of people appeared advancing on the road the fugitives had left, and a chorus of other voices than thoſe of the Carmelites, were heard mingling with the hollow ſound of the waters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="210" facs="unknown:032735_0208_0FF4953B4EF0B500"/>
Ellena, again alarmed, haſtened forward, and Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, though he endeavoured to appeaſe her apprehenſion of purſuit, encouraged her ſpeed.</p>
                     <p>"Theſe are nothing but more pilgrims, Signor," ſaid Paulo, "or they would not ſend ſuch loud ſhouts before them; they muſt needs think we can hear."</p>
                     <p>The travellers proceeded as faſt as the broken road would permit; and were ſoon beyond the reach of the voices; but as Paulo turned to look whether the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was within ſight, he perceived two perſons, wrapt in cloaks, advancing under the brow of the cliffs, and within a few paces of his horſe's heels. Before he could give notice to his maſter, they were at his ſide.</p>
                     <p>"Are you returning from the ſhrine of <hi>our Lady?</hi>" ſaid one of them.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, ſtartled by the voice, looked round, and demanded who aſked the queſtion?</p>
                     <p>"A brother pilgrim," replied the man, "one who has toiled up th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>However compaſſionate Vivaldi might be to the ſufferings of others, this was not a moment when he could indulge his diſpoſition, without endangering the ſafety of Ellena; and he even fancied that the ſtranger ſpoke in a voice of diſſimulation. His ſuſpicions ſtrengthened when the traveller, not repulſed by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, inquired the way he was going, and propoſed to join his party: "For theſe mountains, they ſay, are infeſted with banditti," he added, "and a large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is leſs likely to be attacked than a ſmall one."</p>
                     <p>"If you are ſo very weary, my friend," ſaid Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, "how is it poſſible you can keep pace with our horſes? though I acknowledge you have done won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in overtaking them."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="211" facs="unknown:032735_0209_0FF494CE2A0BA430"/>
"The fear of theſe banditti," replied the ſtranger, "urged us on."</p>
                     <p>"You have nothing to apprehend from robbers," ſaid Vivaldi, "if you will only moderate your pace; for a large company of pilgrims are on the road, who will ſoon overtake you."</p>
                     <p>He then put an end to the converſation, by clapping ſpurs to his horſe, and the ſtrangers were ſoon left far behind. The inconſiſtency of their complaints with their ability, and the whole of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>FROM the ſummit of a mountain, the morning light ſhewed the travellers the diſtant lake of Celano, gleaming at the feet of other lofty mountains of the Appennine, far in the ſouth. Thither Vivaldi judged it prudent to direct his courſe, for the lake lay ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the immediate way to Naples, and from the neighbourhood of San Stefano, that its banks pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed a ſecure retreat. He conſidered, alſo, that among the convents ſcattered along thoſe delightful banks, might eaſily be found a prieſt, who would ſolemnize their nuptials, ſhould Ellena conſent to an immediate marriage.</p>
                     <p>The travellers deſcended among the olive woods, and ſoon after were directed by ſome peaſants at work, into a road that leads from Aquila to the town of Celano, one of the very few roads which intrudes among the wild mountains, that on every ſide ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the lake. As they approached the low grounds, the ſcent of orange bloſſoms breathed upon the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing air, and the ſpicy myrtle ſent forth all its fragrance from among the cliffs, which it thickly tufted. Bowers of lemon and orange ſpread along the valley; and among the cabins of the peaſants, who cultivated them, Vivaldi hoped to obtain repoſe and refreſhment for Ellena.</p>
                     <p>The cottages, however, at which Paulo enquired, were unoccupied, the owners being all gone forth to their labour: and the travellers, again aſcending,
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:032735_0211_0FF494CFB2AE03A8"/>
found themſelves ſoon after among the mountains inhabited by flocks, where the ſcent of the orange was exchanged for the aromatic perfume of the paſturage.</p>
                     <p>"My Signor!" ſaid Paulo, "is not that a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd's horn ſounding at a diſtance? If ſo, the Signora may yet obtain ſome refreſhment."</p>
                     <p>While Vivaldi liſtened, a hautboy and a paſtoral drum were heard conſiderably nearer.</p>
                     <p>They followed the ſound over the turf, and came within view of a cabin, ſheltered from the ſun by a tuft of almond trees. It was a dairy-cabin belonging to ſome ſhepherds, who at a ſhort diſtance were watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their flocks, and, ſtretched beneath the ſhade of cheſnuts, were amuſing themſelves by playing upon theſe rural inſtruments; a ſcene of Arcadian manners frequent at this day, upon the mountains of Abbruzzo. The ſimplicity of their appearance, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to wildneſs, was tempered by a hoſpitable ſpirit. A venerable man, the chief ſhepherd, advanced to meet the ſtrangers: and, learning their wants, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them into his cool cabin, where cream, cheeſe made of goat's milk, honey extracted from the delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous herbage of the mountains, and dried ſigs, were quickly placed before them.</p>
                     <p>Ellena, overcome with fatigue of anxiety, rather than that of travelling, retired, when ſhe had taken breakfaſt, for an hour's repoſe, while Vivaldi reſted on the bench before the cottage, and Paulo, keeping watch, diſcuſſed his breakfaſt, together with the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the late alarm, under the ſhade of the almond trees.</p>
                     <p>When Ellena again appeared, Vivaldi propoſed that they ſhould reſt here during the intenſe heat of the day; and, ſince he now conſidered her to be in a place of temporary ſafety, he ventured to renew the ſubject neareſt his heart; to repreſent the evils that
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:032735_0212_0FF4953E7139BAF8"/>
might overtake them, and to urge an immediate ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization of their marriage.</p>
                     <p>Thoughtful and dejected, Ellena attended for ſome time in ſilence to the arguments and pleadings of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi. She ſecretly acknowledged the juſtneſs of his repreſentations, but ſhe ſhrunk, more than ever, from the indelicacy, the degradation of intruding herſelf into his family; a family, too, from whom ſhe had not only received proofs of ſtrong diſlike, but had ſuffered terrible injuſtice, and been menaced with ſtill ſeverer cruelty. Theſe latter circumſtances, however, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed her from all obligations of delicacy or generoſity, ſo far as concerned only the authors of her ſuffering; and ſhe had now but to conſider the happineſs of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi and herſelf. Yet ſhe could not decide thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitately on a ſubject, which ſo ſolemnly involved the fortune of her whole life; nor forbear reminding Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, affectionately, gratefully, as ſhe loved him, of the circumſtances that with-held her deciſion.</p>
                     <p>"Tell me yourſelf," ſaid ſhe, "whether I ought to give my hand, while your family—your mother"—She pauſed, bluſhed, and burſt into tears.</p>
                     <p>"Spare me the view of theſe tears," ſaid Vivaldi, "and a recollection of the circumſtances, that excite them. O, let me not think of my mother, while I ſee you weep! Let me not remember, that her injuſtice and cruelty deſtined you to perpetual ſorrow!"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi's features became ſlightly convulſed while he ſpoke; he roſe, paced the room with quick ſteps, and then quitted it, and walked under the ſhade of the trees in the front of the cabin.</p>
                     <p>In a few moments, however, he commanded his emotion and returned. Again he placed himſelf on the bench beſide Ellena, and taking her hand, ſaid ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly, and in a voice of extreme ſenſibility, "Ellena, you have long witneſſed how dear you are to me; you cannot doubt my love; you have long ſince promiſed
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:032735_0213_0FF494D3A2DE8768"/>
—ſolemnly promiſed, in the preſence of her who is now no more, but whoſe ſpirit may even at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment look down upon us,—of her, who bequeathed you to my tendereſt care, to be mine for ever. By theſe ſacred truths, by theſe affecting recollections! I conjure you abandon me not to deſpair, nor in the energy of a juſt reſentment, ſacrifice the ſon to the cruel and miſtaken policy of the mother! You, nor I, can conjecture the machinations, which may be ſpread for us, when it ſhall be known that you have left San Stefano. If we delay to exchange our vows, I know, and I feel—that you are loſt to me for ever!"</p>
                     <p>Ellena was affected, and for ſome moments unable to reply. At length, drying her tears, ſhe ſaid ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, "Reſentment can have no influence on my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards you; I think I feel none towards the Marcheſa—for ſhe is your mother. But pride, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted pride, has a right to dictate, and ought to be obeyed; and the time is now, perhaps, arrived when, if I would reſpect myſelf, I muſt renounce you."—</p>
                     <p>"Renounce me!" interrupted Vivaldi, "renounce me! And is it, then, poſſible you could renounce me?" he repeated, his eyes ſtill fixed upon her face with eagerneſs and conſternation, "Tell me at once, Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, is it poſſible?"</p>
                     <p>"I fear it is not," ſhe replied.</p>
                     <p>"You fear! alas! if you <hi>fear,</hi> it is too poſſible, and I have loſt you already! Say, O! ſay but, that you <hi>hope</hi> it is not, and I, too, will hope again."</p>
                     <p>The anguiſh, with which he uttered this, awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all her tenderneſs, and, forgetting the reſerve ſhe had impoſed upon herſelf, and every half-formed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, ſhe ſaid, with a ſmile of ineffable ſweetneſs, "I will neither fear nor hope in this inſtance; I will obey the dictates of gratitude, of affection, and <hi>believe</hi> that I never can renounce you, while you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="216" facs="unknown:032735_0214_0FF4953FF87A5BD8"/>
"Believe!" repeated Vivaldi, "only believe! And why that mention of gratitude; and why that unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary reſervation? Yet even this aſſurance, feebly as it ſuſtains my hopes, is extorted; you ſee my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, and from pity, from <hi>gratitude,</hi> not affection, would aſſuage it. Beſides, you will neither fear, nor hope! Ah, Ellena! did love ever yet exiſt without fear—and without hope? O! never, never! I fear and hope with ſuch rapid tranſition; every aſſurance, every look of yours gives ſuch force either to the one, or to the other, that I ſuffer unceaſing anxiety. Why, too, that cold, that heart-breaking mention of gratitude? No Ellena! it is too certain that you do not love me!—My mother's cruelty has eſtranged your heart from me!</p>
                     <p>"How much you miſtake!" ſaid Ellena. "You have already received ſacred teſtimonies of my regard; if you doubt their ſincerity, pardon me, if I ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect myſelf as to forbear entreating you will believe them."</p>
                     <p>"How calm, how indifferent, how circumſpect, how prudent!" exclaimed Vivaldi in tones of mournful reproach. "But I will not diſtreſs you; forgive me for renewing this ſubject at this time. It was my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to be ſilent till you ſhould have reached a place of more parmanent ſecurity than this; but how was it poſſible, with ſuch anxiety preſſing upon my heart, to perſevere in that deſign! And what have I gained by departing from it?—increaſe of anxiety—of doubt—of fear!"</p>
                     <p>"Why will you perſiſt in ſuch ſelf-inflictions?" ſaid Ellena. "I cannot endure that you ſhould doubt my affection, even for a moment. And how can you ſuppoſe it poſſible, that I ever can become inſenſible of your's; that I can ever forget the imminent danger you have voluntarily incurred for my releaſe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering it, can ceaſe to feel the warmeſt gratitude?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="217" facs="unknown:032735_0215_0FF494DD9D9CBBF8"/>
"That is the very word which tortures me beyond all others!" ſaid Vivaldi; "is it then, only a ſenſe of obligation you own for me? O! rather ſay you hate me, than ſuffer me to deceive my hopes with aſſurances of a ſentiment ſo cold, ſo circumſcribed, ſo dutiful as that of gratitude!"</p>
                     <p>"With me the word has a very different acception, replied Ellena ſmiling. "I underſtand it to imply all that is tender and generous in affection; and the ſenſe of duty which you ſay it includes, is one of the ſweeteſt and moſt ſacred feelings of the human heart."</p>
                     <p>"Ah Ellena! I am too willing to be deceived, to examine your definition rigorouſly; yet I believe it is your ſmile, rather than the accuracy of your expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that perſuades me to a confidence in your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and I will truſt, that the gratitude <hi>you</hi> feel is thus tender and comprehenſive. But, I beſeech you name the word no more! Its ſound is like the touch of the Torpedo, I perceive my confidence chilled even while I liſten to my own pronunciation of it."</p>
                     <p>The entrance of Paulo interrupted the converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who advancing with an air of myſtery, and alarm, ſaid in a low voice,</p>
                     <p>"Signor! as I kept watch under the almond trees, who ſhould I ſee mounting up the road from the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley yonder but the two bare-footed Carmelites, that overtook us in the paſs of Chiari! I loſt them again behind the woods, but I dare ſay they are coming this way, for the moment they ſpy out this dairy-hut, they will gueſs ſomething good is to be had here; and the ſhepherds would believe their flocks would all die if"—</p>
                     <p>"I ſee them at this moment emerging from the woods," ſaid Vivaldi, "and now, they are leaving the road and croſſing this way. Where is our hoſt, Paulo!</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="218" facs="unknown:032735_0216_0FF4954B076DF270"/>
"He is without, at a little diſtance, Signor. Shall I call him?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes," replied Vivaldi, "or ſtay; I will call him myſelf. Yet, if they ſee me"—</p>
                     <p>"Aye, Signor; or, for that matter, if they ſee me. But we cannot help ourſelves now; for if we call the hoſt, we ſhall betray ourſelves, and, if we do not call him, he will betray us; ſo they muſt find us out, be it as it may."</p>
                     <p>"Peace! peace! let me think a moment," ſaid Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi. While Vivaldi undertook to think, Paulo was peeping about for a hiding place, if occaſion ſhould require one.</p>
                     <p>"Call our hoſt immediately," ſaid Vivaldi, "I muſt ſpeak with him."</p>
                     <p>"He paſſes the lattices at this inſtant," ſaid Ellena.</p>
                     <p>Paulo obeyed, and the ſhepherd entered the cabin.</p>
                     <p>"My good friend," ſaid Vivaldi, "I muſt entreat that you will not admit thoſe friars whom you ſee coming this way, nor ſuffer them to know what g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Nay for that matter, friend," ſaid Paulo, "it is their viſit only that can occaſion you loſs, begging the Signor's pardon; their departure never occaſioned loſs to any body. And to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ell you the truth, for my maſter will not ſpeak out, we were obliged to look pretty ſharply about us, while they bore us company, or we have reaſon to think our pockets would have been the lighter. They are deſigning people, friend, take my word for it; banditti perhaps, in diſguiſe. The dreſs of a Carmelite would ſuit their purpoſe, at this time of the pilgrimage. So be pretty blunt with them, if they want to come in here; and you will do well, when they go, to ſend ſomebody to watch which way
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:032735_0217_0FF494DF25A41008"/>
they take, and ſee them clear off, or you may loſe a ſtray lamb perhaps."</p>
                     <p>The old ſhepherd lifted up his eyes and hands, "to ſee how the world goes!" ſaid he. "But thank you, Maeſtro, for your warning; they ſhall not come within my threſhold, for all their holy ſeeming, and its the firſt time in my life I ever ſaid nay to one of their garb, and mine has been a pretty long one, as you may gueſs, perhaps, by my face. How old, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, ſhould you take me to be? I warrant you will gueſs ſhort of the matter though; for one of theſe high mountains"—</p>
                     <p>"I will gueſs when you have diſmiſſed the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers," ſaid Vivaldi, "after having given them ſome haſty refreſhment without, they muſt be almoſt at the door by this time. Diſpatch, friend."</p>
                     <p>"If they ſhould fall foul upon me, for refuſing them entrance," ſaid the ſhepherd, "you will come out to help me, Signor? for my lads are at ſome diſtance."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi aſſured him that they would, and he left the cabin.</p>
                     <p>Paulo ventured to peep at the lattice, on what might be going forward without. "They are gone round to the door, Signor, I fancy," ſaid he, "for I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them this way; if there was but another window! What fooliſh people to build a cottage with no window near the door! But I muſt liſten."</p>
                     <p>He ſtepped on tip-toe to the door, and bent his head in attention.</p>
                     <p>"They are certainly ſpies from the monſtery," ſaid Ellena to Vivaldi, "they follow us ſo cloſely! If they were pilgrims, it is improbable, too, that their way ſhould lie through this unfrequented region, and ſtill more ſo, that they ſhould not travel in a larger party. When my abſence was diſcovered, theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſent, no doubt, in purſuit of me, and having
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:032735_0218_0FF4954C8DC3DD60"/>
met the devotees whom we paſſed, they were enabled to follow our route."</p>
                     <p>"We ſhall do well to act upon this ſuppoſition," replied Vivaldi, "but though I am inclined to believe them emiſſaries from San Stefano, it is not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they are only Carmelites returning to ſome convent on the lake of Celano."</p>
                     <p>"I cannot hear a ſyllable, Signor," ſaid Paulo. "Pray do liſten yourſelf! and there is not a ſingle chink in this door to afford one conſolation. Well! if ever I build a cottage, there ſhall be a window near—"</p>
                     <p>"Liſten!" ſaid Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Not a ſingle word, Signor!" cried Paulo, after a pauſe, "I do not even hear a voice!—But now I hear ſteps, and they are coming to the door, too; they ſhall find it no eaſy matter to open it, though;" he added, placing himſelf againſt it. "Ay, ay, you may knock, friend, till your arm aches, and kick and lay about you—no matter for that."</p>
                     <p>"Silence! let us know who it is," ſaid Vivaldi, and the old ſhepherd's voice was heard without. "They are gone, Signor," ſaid he, "you may open the door."</p>
                     <p>"Which way did they go," aſked Vivaldi, when the man entered. "I cannot ſay, as to that, Signor, becauſe I did not happen to ſee them at all; and I have been looking all about, too."</p>
                     <p>"Why, I ſaw them myſelf, croſſing this way from the wood yonder," ſaid Paulo.</p>
                     <p>"And there is nothing to ſhelter them from our view between the wood and this cottage, friend," add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Vivaldi; "What can they have done with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?"</p>
                     <p>"For that matter, gone into the wood again, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps," ſaid the ſhepherd.</p>
                     <p>Paulo gave his maſter a ſignificant look, and added,
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:032735_0219_0FF494E0B04525B0"/>
"It is likely enough, friend; and you may depend upon it they are lurking there for no good purpoſe. You will do well to ſend ſomebody to look after them; your flocks will ſuffer for it elſe. Depend upon it, they deſign no good."</p>
                     <p>"We are not uſed to ſuch ſort of folks in theſe parts," replied the ſhepherd, "but if they mean us any harm, they ſhall find we can help ourſelves. As he concluded he took down a horn from the roof, and blew a ſhrill blaſt that made the mountains echo; when immediately the younger ſhepherds were ſeen running from various quarters towards the cottage.</p>
                     <p>"Do not be alarmed friend," ſaid Vivaldi, "theſe travellers mean you no harm, I dear ſay, whatever they may deſign againſt us. But, as I think them ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious perſons, and ſhould not like to overtake them on the road, I will reward one of your lads if you will let him go a little ways towards Celano, and examine whether they are lurking on that route."</p>
                     <p>The old man conſented, and when the ſhepherds came up, one of them received directions from Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi.</p>
                     <p>"And be ſure you do not return till you have found them," added Paulo.</p>
                     <p>"No, maſter," replied the lad, "and I will bring them ſafe here you may truſt me."</p>
                     <p>"If you do, friend, you will get your head broke for your trouble. You are only to diſcover where they are, and to watch where they go," ſaid Paulo.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, at length, made the lad comprehend what was required of him, and he departed; while the old ſhepherd went out to keep guard.</p>
                     <p>The time of his abſence was paſſed in various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures by the party in the cabin, concerning the Carmelites. Vivaldi ſtill inclined to believe they were honeſt people returning from a pilgrimage, but Paulo was decidedly againſt this opinion. "They are
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:032735_0220_0FF4954E1DF56F00"/>
waiting for us on the road, you may depend upon it, Signor," ſaid the latter. "You may be certain they have ſome great deſign in hand, or they would never have turned their ſteps from this dairy-houſe when once they had ſpied it, and that they did ſpy it, we are ſure."</p>
                     <p>"But if they have in hand the great deſign you ſpeak of Paulo," ſaid Vivaldi, "it is probable that they have ſpied us alſo, by their taking this obſure road. Now it muſt have occurred to them when they ſaw a dairy-hut, in ſo ſolitary a region, that we might probably be found within—yet they have not examined. It appears, therefore, they have no deſign againſt us. What can you anſwer to this, Paulo! I truſt the apprehenſions of Signora di Roſalba are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded."</p>
                     <p>"Why! do you ſuppoſe, Signor, they would attack us when we're ſafe houſed, and had theſe good ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds to lend us a helping hand? No, Signor, they would not even have ſhewn themſelves if they could have helped it; and being once ſure we were here, they would ſkulk back to the woods, and lurk for us in the road they knew we muſt go, ſince, as it happens, there is only one."</p>
                     <p>"How is it poſſible," ſaid Ellena, "that they can have diſcovered us here, ſince they did not approach the cabin to enquire?"</p>
                     <p>"They came near enough for their purpoſe, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora, I dare ſay; and, if the truth were known, they ſpied my face looking at them through the lattice."</p>
                     <p>"Come, come," ſaid Vivaldi, "you are an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious tormentor, indeed, Paulo, Do you ſuppoſe they ſaw enough of thy face laſt night by moonlight, in that duſky glen to enable them to recollect it again at a diſtance of forty yards? Revive, my Ellena, I think every appearance is in our favour."</p>
                     <p>"Would I could think ſo too!" ſaid ſhe with a ſigh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="223" facs="unknown:032735_0221_0FF494E239009338"/>
"O! for that matter, Signora," rejoined Paulo, "there is nothing to be afraid of; they ſhould find tough work of it, if they thought proper to attack us, lady."</p>
                     <p>"It is not an open attack that we have to fear," replied Ellena, "but they may ſurround us with their ſnares, and defy reſiſtance."</p>
                     <p>However Vivaldi might accede to the truth of this remark, he would not appear to do ſo; but he tried to laugh away her apprehenſions; and Paulo was ſilenced for a while by a ſignificant look from his maſter.</p>
                     <p>The ſhepherd's boy returned much ſooner than they had expected, and he probably ſaved his time that he might ſpare his labour, for he brought no intelligence of the Carmelites. "I looked for them among the woods along the road ſide in the hollow, yonder," ſaid the lad, "and then I mounted the hill further on, but I could ſee nothing of them far or near, nor of a ſingle ſoul, except our goats, and ſome of them do ſtray wide enough, ſometimes; they lead me a fine dance often. They ſometimes, Signor, have wandered as far as Monte Nuvola, yonder, and got to the top of it, up among the clouds, and the crags, where I ſhould break my neck if I climbed; and the rogues ſeemed to know it, too, for when they have ſeen me coming, ſcramb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up, puffing and blowing, they have ceaſed their capering, and ſtood peeping over a crag ſo fly, and ſo quiet, it ſeemed as if they were laughing at me; as much as to ſay, "Catch us if you can."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, who during the latter part of this ſpeech had been conſulting with Ellena, whether they ſhould proceed on their way immediately, aſked the boy ſome further queſtions concerning the Carmelites; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming convinced that they had either not taken the road to Celano, or, having taken it, were at a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtance, he propoſed ſetting out, and proceeding leiſurely; "For I have now little apprehenſion of
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:032735_0222_0FF494D13808B230"/>
theſe people," he added, "and a great deal leſt night ſhould overtake us before we reach the place of our deſtination, ſince the road is mountainous and wild, and, further, we are not perfectly acquainted with it."</p>
                     <p>Ellena approving the plan, they took leave of the good ſhepherd, who could with difficulty be prevailed with to accept any recompence for his trouble, and who gave them ſome further directions as to the road; and their way was long cheered by the ſound of the tabor, and the ſweetneſs of the hautboy, wafted over the wild.</p>
                     <p>When they deſcended into the woody hollow men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the boy, Ellena ſent forth many an anxious look beneath the deep ſhade; while Paulo, ſometimes ſilent, and at others whiſtling and ſinging loudly, as if to overcome his fears, peeped under every bough that croſſed the road, expecting to diſcover his friends the Carmelites lurking within its gloom.</p>
                     <p>Having emerged from this valley, the road lay over the mountains covered with flocks, for it was now the ſeaſon when they had quitted the plains of Apulia, to feed upon the herbage for which this region is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated; and it was near ſun-ſet, when, from a ſummit to which the travellers had long been aſcending, the whole lake of Celano, with its vaſt circle of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, burſt at once upon their view.</p>
                     <p>"Ah Signor!" exclaimed Paulo, "what a proſpect is here! It reminds me of home; it is almoſt as pleaſant as the bay of Naples! I ſhould never love it like that though, if it were an hundred times finer."</p>
                     <p>The travellers ſtopped to admire the ſcene, and to give their horſes reſt, after the labour of the aſcent. The evening ſun, ſhooting athwart a clear expanſe of water, between eighteen and twenty leagues in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, lighted up all the town and villages, and towered caſtles, and ſpiry convents, that enriched the riſing ſhores; brought out all the various tints of cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation,
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:032735_0223_0FF494EC731ADAF0"/>
and coloured with beamy purple the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains which on every ſide formed the majeſtic back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground of the landſcape. Vivaldi pointed out to El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena the gigantic Velino in the north, a barrier moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, between the territories of Rome and Naples. Its peaked head towered far above every neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſummit, and its white precipices were oppoſed to the verdant points of the Majella, ſnow crowned, and next in altitude, loved by the flocks. Weſtward near woody hills, and riſing immediately from the lake, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared Monte Salviano, covered with wild ſage, as its name imports, and once pompous with foreſts of cheſtnut; a branch from the Appennine extended to meet it. "See," ſaid Vivaldi, "where Monte-Corno ſtands like a ruſſian, huge, ſeared, threatening, and horrid!—and in the ſouth, where the ſullen mountain of San Nicolo ſhoots up, barren and rocky! From thence, mark how other overtopping ridges of the mighty Appennine darken the horizon far along the eaſt, and circle to approach the Velino in the north!"</p>
                     <p>"Mark too," ſaid Ellena, "how ſweetly the banks and undulating plains repoſe at the feet of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; what an image of beauty and elegance they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to the awful grandeur that overlooks and guards them? Obſerve, too, how many a delightful valley, opening from the lake, ſpreads its rice and corn fields, ſhaded with groves of the almond far among the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hills; how gaily vineyards and olives alternately chequer the acclivities, and how gracefully the lofty palms bend over the higher cliffs."</p>
                     <p>"Ay, Signora!" exclaimed Paulo, "and have the goodneſs to obſerve how like are the fiſhing boats, that ſail towards the hamlet below, to thoſe one ſees upon the bay of Naples. They are worth all the reſt of the proſpect, except indeed this fine ſheet of water, which is almoſt as good as the bay, and that mountain, with its ſharp head, which is almoſt as good as Vesu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vius—if it would but throw out fire!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="226" facs="unknown:032735_0224_0FF4954FA69CFE98"/>
"We muſt deſpair of finding a mountain in this neighbourhood, ſo <hi>good</hi> as to do that, Paulo," ſaid Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, ſmiling at this ſtroke of nationalty; "though, perhaps, many that we now ſee, have been volcanic."</p>
                     <p>"I honor them for that Signor; and look at them with double ſatisfaction; but <hi>our</hi> mountain is the only mountain in the world. O! to ſee it of a dark night! what a blazing it makes! and what a height it will ſhoot to! and what a light it throws over the ſea! No other mountain can do ſo. It ſeems as if the waves were all on fire. I have ſeen the reflection as far as Capri, trembling all acroſs the gulf, and ſhewing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry veſſel as plain as at noon day; ay, and every ſailor on the deck. You never ſaw ſuch a ſight, Signor."</p>
                     <p>"Why you do, indeed, ſeem to have forgotten that I ever did, Paulo, and alſo that a volcano can do any miſchief. But let us return, Ellena, to the ſcene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. Yonder, a mile or two within the ſhore, is the town of Celano, whither we are going."</p>
                     <p>The clearneſs of an Italian atmoſphere permitted him to diſcriminate the minute through very diſtant features of the landſcape; and on an eminence riſing from the plains of a valley, opening to the weſt, he pointed out the modern Alba, crowned with the ruins of its ancient caſtle ſtill viſible upon the ſplendor of the horizon, the priſon and the tomb of many a Prince, who, "fallen from his high eſtate," was ſent from Imperial Rome to finiſh here the ſad reverſe of his days; to gaze from the bars of his tower upon ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes where beauty or grandeur adminiſtered no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaging feeling to him, whoſe life had paſſed amidſt the intrigues of the world and the feveriſh contentions of diſappointed ambition; to him, with whom reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion brought only remorſe, and anticipation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; whom, no horizontal beam enlivened in the crimſon evening of life's duſty day."</p>
                     <p>"And ſuch a ſcene as this," ſaid Vivaldi, "a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:032735_0225_0FF494EE02A48B50"/>
emperor came, only for the purpoſe of witneſſing the moſt barbarous exhibition; to indulge the moſt ſavage delights! Here, Claudius celebrated the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of his arduous work, an aqueduct to carry the overflowing waters of the Celano to Rome, by a naval fight, in which hundreds of wretched ſlaves periſhed for his amuſement! Its pure and poliſhed ſurface was ſtained with human blood, and roughened by the plunging bodies of the ſlain, while the gilded gallies of the Emperor floated gaily around, and theſe beautiful ſhores were made to echo with applauding yells, worthy of the furies!"</p>
                     <p>"We ſcarcely dare to truſt the truth of hiſtory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Signor," cried Paulo, "I have been thinking that while we are taking the air, ſo much at our eaſe, here, thoſe Carmelites may be ſpying at us from ſome hole or corner that we know nothing of, and may ſwoop upon us, all of a ſudden, before we can help ourſelves. Had we not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> go on, Signor?"</p>
                     <p>"Our horſes are, perhaps, ſufficiently reſted," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Vivaldi, "but, if I had not long ſince diſmiſſed all ſuſpicion of the evil intention of thoſe ſtrangers, I ſhould not willingly have ſtopped for a moment."</p>
                     <p>"But pray let us proceed," ſaid Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"Ay, Signora, it is beſt to be of the ſafe ſide," ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Paulo. "Yonder, below, is Celano, and I hope we ſhall get ſafe houſed, there, before it is quite dark, for here we have no mountain, that will light us on our way! Ah! if we were within twenty miles of Naples now—and it was an illumination night!"—</p>
                     <p>As they deſcended the mountain, Ellena, ſilent and dejected, abandoned herſelf to reflection. She was too ſenſible of the difficulties of her preſent ſituation, and too apprehenſive of the influence, which her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination muſt have on all her future life, to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, though eſcaped from the priſon of San Steſano, and
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:032735_0226_0FF495605AB0CB50"/>
in the preſence of Vivaldi, her beloved deliverer and protector. He obſerved her dejection with grief, and not underſtanding all the finer ſcruples that diſtreſſed her, interpreted her reſerve into indifference towards himſelf. But he forbore to diſturb her again with a mention of doubts, or fears; and he determined not to urge the ſubject of his late entreaties, till he ſhould have placed her in ſome ſecure aſylum, where ſhe might feel herſelf at perfect liberty to accept or reject his propoſal. By acting with an honor ſo delicate, he unconſciouſly adopted a certain means of encreaſing her eſteem and gratitude, and deſerved them the more, ſince he had to endure the apprehenſion of loſing her by the delay thus occaſioned to their nuptials.</p>
                     <p>They reached the town of Celano before the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſed; when Vivaldi was requeſted by Ellena to enquire for a convent, where ſhe might be lodged for the night. He left her at the inn, with Paulo for her guard, and proceeded on his ſearch. The firſt gate he knocked upon belonged to a convent of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melites. It appeared probable, that the pilgrims of that order, who had occaſioned him ſo much diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, were honeſt brothers of this houſe; but as it was probable alſo, that if they were emiſſaries of the Abbeſs of San Stefano, and came to Celano, they would take up their lodgings with a ſociety of their own claſs, in preference to that of any other, Vivaldi thought it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to retire from their gates without making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf known. He paſſed on, therefore, and ſoon after arrived at a convent of Dominicans, where he learned, that there were only two houſes of nuns in Celano, and that theſe admitted no other boarders than perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ones.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi returned with this intelligence to Ellena, who endeavoured to reconcil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> herſelf to the neceſſity of remaining where ſhe was; but Poulo, ever active and zealous, brought intelligence, that at a little fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:032735_0227_0FF494EF88A011A0"/>
town, at ſome diſtance, on the bank of the lake, was a convent of Urſalines, remarkable for their hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality of ſtrangers. The obſcurity of ſo remote a place, was another reaſon for prefering it to Celano, and Vivaldi propoſing to remove thither, if Ellena was not too weary to proceed, ſhe readily aſſented, and they immediately ſet off.</p>
                     <p>"It happens to be a fine night," ſaid Paulo, as they left Celano, "and ſo, Signor, we cannot well loſe our way; beſides, they ſay, there is but one. The town we are going to lies yonder on the edge of the lake, about a mile and a half off. I think I can ſee a gray ſteeple or two, a little to the right of that wood where the water gleams ſo."</p>
                     <p>"No, Paulo," replied Vivaldi, after looking atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively. "I perceive what you mean; but thoſe are not the points of ſteeples, they are only the tops of ſome tall cypreſſes."</p>
                     <p>"Pardon me, Signor, they are too tapering for trees; that muſt ſurely be the town. This road, however, will lead us right, for there is no other to puzzle us, as they ſay."</p>
                     <p>"This cool and balmy air revives me," ſaid El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena; "and what a ſoothing ſhade prevails over the ſcene! How softened, yet how diſtinct, is every near object; how ſweetly dubious are the more removed ones; while the mountains beyond character them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſublimely upon the ſtill glowing horizon."</p>
                     <p>"Obſerve, too," ſaid Vivaldi, "how their broken ſummits, tipt with the beams that have ſet to our lower region, exhibit the portraiture of towers and caſtles, and embattled ramparts, which ſeemed deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to guard them againſt the enemies, that may come by the clouds."</p>
                     <p>"Yes," replied Ellena, "the mountains themſelves diſplay a ſublimity, that ſeems to belong to a higher
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:032735_0228_0FF4955BB5FA8AE0"/>
world; their beſiegers ought not to be of this earth; they can be only ſpirits of the air."</p>
                     <p>"They can be nothing elſe, Signora," ſaid Paulo, "for nothing of this earth can reach them. See! lady, they have ſome of the qualities of your ſpirits, too; ſee! how they change their ſhapes and colours, as the ſunbeams ſink. And now, how gray and dim they grow! See but how faſt they vaniſh?"</p>
                     <p>"Every thing repoſes," ſaid Vivaldi. "Who would willingly travel in the day, when Italy has ſuch nights as this!"</p>
                     <p>"Signor, that is the town before us," ſaid Paulo, "for now I can diſcern, plain enough, the ſpires of convents; and there goes a light! Hah! hah! and there is a bell, too, chiming from one of the ſpires! The monks are going to maſs; would we were going to ſupper, Signor!"</p>
                     <p>"That chime is nearer than the place you point to, Paulo, and I doubt whether it comes from the ſame quarter."</p>
                     <p>"Hark! Signor, the air wafts the ſound! and now it is gone again."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, I believe you are right, Paulo, and that we have not far to go."</p>
                     <p>The travellers deſcended the gradual ſlopes, towards the ſhore; and Paulo, ſome time after, exclaimed, "See, Signor, where another light glides along! See! it is reflected on the lake."</p>
                     <p>"I hear the faint daſhing of waves, now," ſaid El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena, "and the ſound of oars, too. But obſerve, Paulo, the light is not in the town, it is in the boat that moves yonder."</p>
                     <p>"Now it retreats, and trembles in a lengthening line upon the waters," ſaid Vivaldi. "We have been too ready to believe what we wiſh, and have yet far to go"</p>
                     <p>The ſhore they were approaching formed a ſpacious
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:032735_0229_0FF494F10E1ACF30"/>
bay for the lake immediately below. Dark woods ſeemed to ſpread along the banks, and aſcend among the cultivated ſlopes towards the mountains; except where, here and there, cliffs, bending over the water, were diſtinguiſhed through the twilight by the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their limeſtone precipices. Within the bay, the town became gradually viſible; lights twinkled between the trees, appearing and vaniſhing, like the ſtars of a cloudy night; and, at length was heard the melancholy ſong of boatmen, who were fiſhing near the ſhore.</p>
                     <p>Other ſounds ſoon after ſtruck the ear. "O, what merry notes!" exclaimed Paulo, "they make my heart dance. See! Signora, there is a groupe, footing it away ſo gaily on the bank of the lake yonder, by thoſe trees. O, what merry ſet! Would I were among them! that is, I mean, if you, Maeſtro, and the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora were not here."</p>
                     <p>"Well corrected, Paulo."</p>
                     <p>"It is a feſtival, I fancy," obſerved Vivaldi.—Theſe peaſants of the lake can make the moments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"O! what merry muſic!" repeated Paulo. "Ah! how often I have footed it as joyouſly on the beach at Naples, after ſun-ſet, of a fine night, like this; with ſuch a pleaſant freſh breeze to cool one! Ah! there are none like the fiſhermen of Naples for a dance by moonlight; how lightly they do trip it! O! if I was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ut there now! That is, I mean, if you, Maeſtro, and the Signora were there too. O! what merry notes!"</p>
                     <p>"We thank you, good Signor Paulo," ſaid Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, "and I truſt we ſhall all be there ſoon; when you ſhall trip it away, with as joyous a heart as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eſt of them."</p>
                     <p>The travellers now entered the town, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of one ſtreet, ſtraggling along the margin of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>; and having enquired for the Urſaline convent,
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:032735_0230_0FF494FDE1C32C58"/>
were directed to its gates. The portreſs appeared immediately upon the ringing of the bell, and carried a meſſage to the Abbeſs, who as quickly returned an invitation to Ellena. She alighted, and followed the portreſs to the parlour, while Vivaldi remained at the gate, till he ſhould know whether ſhe approved of her new lodging. A ſecond invitation induced him alſo to alight; he was admitted to the grate, and offered refreſhment, which, however, he declined ſtaying to accept, as he had yet a lodging to ſeek for the night. The Abbeſs, on learning this circumſtance, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly recommended him to a neighbouring ſociety of Benedictines, and deſired him to mention her name to the Abbot.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi then took leave of Ellena, and, though it was only for a few hours, he left her with dejection, and with ſome degree of apprehenſion for her ſafety, which, though circumſtances could not juſtify him in admitting, he could not entirely ſubdue. She ſhared his dejection, but not his fears, when the door cloſed after him, and ſhe found herſelf once more among ſtrangers. The forlornneſs of her feelings could not be entirely overcome by the attentions of the Abbeſs; and there was a degree of curioſity, and even of ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, expreſſed in the looks of ſome of the ſiſters, which ſeemed more than was due to a ſtranger. From ſuch examination ſhe eagerly eſcaped to the repoſe from which ſhe had ſo long been withheld.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, meanwhile, had found an hoſpitable recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Benedictines, whoſe ſequeſtered ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made the viſit of a ſtranger a pleaſurable novelty to them. In the eagerneſs of converſation, and, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſatisfaction which the mind receives from exerciſing ideas that have long ſlept in duſky indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and to the pleaſure of admitting new ones, the Abbot and a few of the brothers ſat with Vivaldi to a late hour. When, at length, the traveller was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:032735_0231_0FF494FF69CA97D8"/>
to retire, other ſubjects than thoſe, which had intereſted his hoſt, engaged his thoughts; and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved the means of preventing the miſery that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened him, in a ſerious ſeparation from Ellena. Now, that ſhe was received into a reſpectable aſylum, every motive for ſilence upon this topic was done away. He determined, therefore, that on the following morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he would urge all his reaſons and entreaties for an immediate marriage; and among the brothers of the Benedictines, he had little doubt of prevailing with one to ſolemnize the nuptials, which he believed would place his happineſs and Ellena's peace, beyond the influence of malignant poſſibilities.</p>

                     <p>WHILE Vivaldi and Ellena were on the way from San Stefano, the Marcheſe Vivaldi was ſuffering the utmoſt vexation, reſpecting his ſon; and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa felt not leſs apprehenſion, that the abode of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena might be diſcovered; yet this fear did not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her from mingling in all the gaieties of Naples. Her aſſemblies were, as uſual, among the moſt brilliant of that voluptuous city, and ſhe patronized, as zealouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>fore, the ſtrains of her favourite compoſer. But, notwithſtanding this perpetual diſſipation, her thoughts frequently withdrew themſelves from the ſcene, and dwelt on gloomy forebodings of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pride.</p>
                     <p>A circumſtance, which rendered her particularly ſuſceptible to ſuch diſappointment at this time, was, that overtures of alliance had been lately made to the Marcheſe, by the father of a lady, who was held ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in every conſideration, to become his daughter; and whoſe wealth rendered the union particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable at a time, when the expences of ſuch an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment as was neceſſary to the vanity of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa, conſiderably exceeded his income, large as it was.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa's temper had been thus irritated by the contemplation of her ſon's conduct in an affair, which ſo materially affected the fortune, and, as ſhe believed, the honour of his family; when a courier
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:032735_0233_0FF49500F11B8C68"/>
from the Abbeſs of San Stefano brought intelligence of the flight of Ellena with Vivaldi. She was in a diſpoſition, which heightened diſappointment into fury; and ſhe forfeited, by the tranſports to which ſhe yielded, the degree of pity that otherwiſe was due to a mother, who believed her only ſon to have ſacrificed his family and himſelf to an unworthy paſſion. She believed, that he was now married, and irrecoverably loſt. Scarcely able to endure the agony of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, ſhe ſent for her antient adviſer Schedoni, that ſhe might, at leaſt, have the relief of expreſſing her emotion; and of examining whether there remained a poſſibility of diſſolving theſe long-dreaded nuptials. The phrenzy of paſſion, however, did not ſo far over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her circumſpection as to compel her to acquaint the Marcheſe with the contents of the Abbeſs's letter, before ſhe had conſulted with her Confeſſor. She knew that the principles of her huſband were too juſt, upon the grand points of morality, to ſuffer him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt the meaſures ſhe might judge neceſſary; and ſhe avoided informing him of the marriage of his ſon, until the means of counteracting it ſhould have been ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted and accompliſhed, however deſperate ſuch means might be.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni was not to be found. Trifling circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances encreaſe the irritation of a mind in ſuch a ſtate as was her's. The delay of an opportunity for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthening her heart to Schedoni, was hardly to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured; another and another meſſenger were diſpatched to her Confeſſor.</p>
                     <p>"My miſtreſs has committed ſome great ſin, truely!" ſaid the ſervant, who had been twice to the convent within the laſt half hour. "It muſt lie heavy on her conſcience, in good truth, ſince ſhe cannot ſupport it for one half hour. Well! the rich have this comfort, however, that, let them be ever ſo guilty, they can buy themſelves innocent again, in the twinkling of a
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:032735_0234_0FF4955ED44CB760"/>
ducat. Now a poor man might be a month before he recovered his innocence, and that, too, not till after many a bout of hard flogging."</p>
                     <p>In the evening Schedoni came, but it was only to confirm her worſt fear. He, too, had heard of the eſcape of Ellena, as well as that ſhe was on the lake of Celano, and was married to Vivaldi. How he had obtained this information he did not chuſe to diſcloſe, but he mentioned ſo many minute circumſtances in confirmation of its truth, and appeared to be ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly convinced of the facts he related, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa believed them, as implicitly as himſelf; and her paſſion and deſpair tranſgreſſed all bounds of decorum.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni obſerved, with dark and ſilent pleaſure, the turbulent exceſs of her feelings; and perceived that the moment was now arrived, when he might command them to his purpoſe, ſo as to render his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance indiſpenſable to her repoſe: and probably ſo as to accompliſh the revenge he had long mediated againſt Vivaldi, without hazarding the favour of the Marche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa. So far was he from attempting to ſooth her ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, that he continued to irr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ate her reſentment, and exaſperate her pride; effecting this, at the ſame time, with ſuch imperceptible art, that he appeared on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be palliating the conduct of Vivaldi, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to conſole his diſtracted mother.</p>
                     <p>"This is a raſh ſtep, certainly," ſaid the Confeſſor; "but he is young, very young, and therefore, does not foreſee the conſequence to which it leads. He does not perceive how ſeriouſly it will affect the dignity of his houſe;—how much it will depreciate his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence with the court, with the nobles of his own rank, and even with the plebeians, with whom he has condeſcended to connect himſelf. Intoxicated with the paſſions of youth, he does not weigh the value of thoſe bleſſings, which wiſdom and the experience of maturer age know how to eſtimate. He neglects

                     <p>"Your excuſes, reverend father," ſaid the tortured Marcheſa, "prove the goodneſs of your heart; but they illuſtrate, alſo, the degeneracy of his mind, and detail the full extent of the effects which he has brought upon his family. It affords me no conſolation to know, that this degradation proceeds from his head, rather than his heart; it is ſufficient that he has incurred it, and that no poſſibility remains of throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the misfortune."</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps that is affirming too much," obſerved Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>"How, father!" ſaid the Mercheſa.</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps a poſſibility does remain," ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>"Point it out to me, good father! I do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it."</p>
                     <p>"Nay, my lady," replied the ſubtle Schedoni, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting himſelf, "I am by no means aſſured, that ſuch poſſibility does exiſt. My ſolicitude, for your tranquility, and for the honour of your houſe, makes me ſo unwilling to relinquiſh hope, that, perhaps, I only imagine a poſſibility in your favour. Let me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.—Alas! the misfortune, ſevere as it is, muſt be endured; there remain no means of eſcaping from it."</p>
                     <p>"It was cruel of you, father, to ſuggeſt a hope which you could not juſtify," obſerved the Marcheſa.</p>
                     <p>"You muſt excuſe my extreme ſolicitude, then," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the confeſſor." "But how is it poſſible for me to ſee a family of your ancient eſtimation brought into ſuch circumſtances; its honours blighted by the folly of a thoughtleſs boy, without feeling ſorrow and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and looking round for even ſome deſperate means of delivering it from diſgrace." He pauſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="238" facs="unknown:032735_0236_0FF4950E9E8798F8"/>
"Diſgrace!" exclaimed the Marcheſa, "father, you—you—Diſgrace!—The word is a ſtrong one, but—it is, alas! juſt. And ſhall we ſubmit to this?—Is it poſſible we <hi>can</hi> ſubmit to it?"</p>
                     <p>"There is no remedy," ſaid Schedoni, coolly.</p>
                     <p>"Good God! exclaimed the Marcheſa "that there ſhould be no law to prevent, or, at leaſt, to puniſh ſuch criminal marriages?"</p>
                     <p>"It is much to be lamented," replied Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>"The woman who obtrudes herſelf upon a family, to diſhonour it," continued the Marcheſa, "deſerves a puniſhment nearly equal to that of a ſtate criminal, ſince ſhe injures thoſe who beſt ſupport the ſtate. She ought to ſuffer"—</p>
                     <p>"Not nearly, but quite equal," interrupted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, "ſhe deſerves—death!"</p>
                     <p>He pauſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d, and there was a moment of profound ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, till he added—"for death only can obliviate the degradation ſhe has occaſioned; her death alone can reſtore the original ſplendor of the line ſhe would have ſullied."</p>
                     <p>He pauſed again, but the Marcheſa ſtill remaining ſilent, he added, "I have often marvelled that our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers ſhould have failed to perceive the juſtneſs, nay the neceſſity, of ſuch puniſhment!"</p>
                     <p>"It is aſtoniſhing," ſaid the Marcheſa, thoughtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, "that a regard for their own honor did not ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt it."</p>
                     <p>"Juſtice does not the leſs exiſt, becauſe her laws are neglected," obſerved Schedoni. "A ſenſe of what ſhe commands lives in our breaſts; and when we fail to obey that ſenſe, is is to weakneſs, not to virtue, that we yield."</p>
                     <p>"Certainly," replied the Marcheſa, "that truth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet was doubted."</p>
                     <p>"Pardon me, I am not ſo certain as to that," ſaid the Confeſſor; "when juſtice happens to oppoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:032735_0237_0FF4950D0C256FA0"/>
we are apt to believe it virtuous to diſobey her. For inſtance, though the law of juſtice demands the death of this girl, yet becauſe the law of the land forbears to enforce it, you, my daughter, even you! though poſſeſſed of a man's ſpirit, and his clear per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, would think that virtue bade her live, when it was only fear!"</p>
                     <p>"Ha!" exclaimed the Marcheſa, in a low voice, "What is that you mean? You ſhall find I have a man's courage alſo."</p>
                     <p>"I ſpeak without diſguiſe." replied Schedoni, "my meaning requires none."</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa muſed, and remained ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"I have done my duty," reſumed Schedoni, at length. "I have pointed out the only way that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for you to eſcape diſhonor. If my zeal is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing—but I have none."</p>
                     <p>"No, good father, no," ſaid the Marcheſa; you miſtake the cauſe of my emotion. New ideas, new proſpects, open!—they confuſe, they diſtract me My mind has not yet attained ſufficient ſtrength to encounter them; ſome woman's weakneſs ſtill lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers at my heart."</p>
                     <p>"Pardon my inconſiderate zeal," ſaid Schedoni, with affected humility, "I have been to blame. If your's is a weakneſs, it is, at leaſt, an amiable one, and, perhaps, deſerves to be encouraged, rather than conquered."</p>
                     <p>"How, father! If it deſerves encouragement, it is not a weakneſs, but a virtue."</p>
                     <p>"Be it ſo," ſaid Schedoni, coolly, "the intereſt I have felt on this ſubject, has, perhaps, miſled my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and has made unjuſt. Think no more of it, or, if you do, let it be only to pardon the zeal I have teſtified."</p>
                     <p>"It does not deſerve pardon, but thanks," replied the Marcheſa, "not thanks only, but reward. Good
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:032735_0238_0FF4956A969BD780"/>
father, I hope it will ſome time be in my power to prove the ſincerity of my words."</p>
                     <p>The Confeſſor bowed his head.</p>
                     <p>"I truſt that the ſervices you have rendered me, ſhall be gratefully repaid—rewarded, I dare not hope, for what benefit could poſſibly reward a ſervice ſo vaſt, as it may, perhaps, be in your power to confer upon my family! What recompence could be balanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the benefit of having reſcued the honor of an ancient houſe!"</p>
                     <p>"Your goodneſs is beyond my thanks, or my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert," ſaid Schedoni, and he was again ſilent.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa wiſhed him to lead her back to the point, from which ſhe herſelf had deviated, and he ſeemed determined, that ſhe ſhould lead him thither. She muſed, and heſitated. Her mind was not yet fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with attrocious guilt; and the crime which Schedoni had ſuggeſted, ſomewhat alarmed her. She ſeared to think, and ſtill more to name it; yet, ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutely ſuſceptible was her pride, ſo ſtern her indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo profound her deſire of vengeance, that her mind was toſſed as on a tempeſtuous ocean, and theſe terrible feelings threatened to overwhelm all the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of humanity in her heart. Schedoni obſerved all its progreſſive movements, and, like a gaunt tyger, lurked in ſilence, ready to ſpring forward at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of opportunity.</p>
                     <p>"Is it your advice, then, father," reſumed the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa, after a long pauſe,—"is it your opinion—that Ellena"—She heſitated, deſirous that Schedoni ſhould anticipate her meaning; but he choſe to ſpare his own delicacy rather than that of the Marcheſa.</p>
                     <p>"You think, then, that this inſidious girl deſerves"—She pauſed again, but the Confeſſor, ſtill ſilent, ſeemed to wait with ſubmiſſion for what the Marcheſa ſhould deliver.</p>
                     <p>"I repeat, father, that it is your opinion this girl deſerves ſevere puniſhment."—</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="241" facs="unknown:032735_0239_0FF49510271DBBA0"/>
Undoubtedly replied Schedoni, "It is not alſo your own?"</p>
                     <p>"That not any puniſhment can be too ſevere?" continued the Marcheſa. "That juſtice, equally with neceſſity, demands—her life? Is not this your opinion too?"</p>
                     <p>"O! pardon me," ſaid Schedoni, "I may have erred; that only <hi>was</hi> my opinion; and when I form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, I was probably too much under the influence of zeal to be juſt. When the heart is warm, how is it poſſible that the judgment can be cool?"</p>
                     <p>"It is not then, your opinion, holy father," ſaid the Marcheſa with diſpleaſure.</p>
                     <p>"I do not abſolutely ſay that," replied the Confeſſor—"But I leave it to your better judgment to decide upon its juſtneſs."</p>
                     <p>As he ſaid this, he roſe to depart. The Marcheſa was agitated and perplexed, and requeſted he would ſtay; but he excuſed himſelf by alledging that it was the hour he muſt attend a particular maſs.</p>
                     <p>"Well then holy father, I will occupy no more of your valuable moments at preſent; but you know I highly eſtimate your advice, and will not refuſe, when I ſhall at ſome future time requeſt it."</p>
                     <p>"I cannot refuſe to accept an honour," replied the Confeſſor, with an air of meekneſs, "but the ſubject you allude to is delicate,"—</p>
                     <p>"And therefore I muſt value, and require your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion upon it," rejoined the Marcheſa.</p>
                     <p>"I would wiſh you to value your own," replied Schedoni; "you cannot have a better director."</p>
                     <p>"You flatter, father."</p>
                     <p>"I only reply, my daughter."</p>
                     <p>"On the evening of to-morrow, ſaid the Marcheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, gravely, "I ſhall be at veſpers in the church of San Nicolo; if you ſhould happen to be there, you will probably ſee me, when the ſervice is over, and the

congregation is departed, in the north cloiſter. We can there converſe on the ſubject neareſt my heart, and without obſervation.—Farewell!"</p>
                     <p>"Peace be with you, daughter! and wiſdom coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel your thoughts!" replied Schedoni, I will not fail to viſit San Nicholo."</p>
                     <p>He folded his hands upon his breaſt, bowed his head, and left the apartment with the ſilent foot-ſtep, that indicates wearineſs and conſcious duplicity.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa remained in her cloſet, ſhaken by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver verying paſſions, and ever-fluctuating opinions; meditating miſery for others, and inflicting it only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on herſelf.</p>

                     <p>THE Marcheſa repaired, according to her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, to the church of San Nicolo, and, ordering her ſervants to remain with the carriage at a ſide-door, entered the choir attended only by her woman.</p>
                     <p>When veſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>s had concluded, ſhe lingered till near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every perſon had quitted the choir, and then walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the ſolitary aiſle, to the north cloiſter. Her heart was as heavy as her ſtep; for when is it that peace and evil paſſions dwell together? As ſhe ſlowly paced the cloiſters, ſhe perceived a monk paſſing between on the pillars, who, as he approached, lifted his crowl, and ſhe knew him to be Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>He inſtantly obſerved the agitation of her ſpirits, and that her purpoſe was not yet determined according to his hope. But, though his mind became cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his countenance remained unaltered; it was grave and thoughtful. The ſternneſs of his vulture-eye was, however, ſomewhat ſoftened, and its lids were contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſubtlety.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa bade her woman walk apart, while ſhe conferred with her Confeſſor.</p>
                     <p>"This unhappy boy" ſaid ſhe, when the attendant was at ſome diſtance, "How much ſuffering does his folly inflict upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>s family! My good father, I have need of all your advice and conſolation. My mind is perpetually haunted by a ſenſe of my misfortune; it
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:032735_0242_0FF4956DA89A97A0"/>
has no reſpite; awake, or in my dream, this ungrateful ſon alike purſues me! The only relief my heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives is when converſing with you—my only coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, my only diſintereſted friend."</p>
                     <p>The Confeſſor bowed. "The Marcheſa is no doubt, equally afflicted with yourſelf," ſaid he; "but he is notwithſtanding, much more competent to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you on this delicate ſubject than I am."</p>
                     <p>"The Marcheſa has prejudices, father, as you well know; he is a ſenſible man, but he is ſometimes miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and he is incorrigible in error. He has the faults of a mind that is merely well diſpoſed; he is deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of the deſcernment and the energy which would make it great. If it is neceſſary to adopt a conduct, that departs in the ſmalleſt degree from thoſe common rules of morality which he has cheriſhed, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining them, from his infancy, he is ſhocked, and ſhrinks from action. He cannot diſcrimnate the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that render the ſame action virtuous or vicious. How then, father, are we to ſuppoſe he would approve of the bold inflictions we meditate?"</p>
                     <p>"Moſt true!" ſaid the artful Schedoni, with an air of admiration,</p>
                     <p>"We therefore, muſt not conſult him," continued the Marcheſa, "leſt he ſhould now, as formerly, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and maintain objections, to which we cannot yield. What paſſes in converſation with you, father, is ſacred, it goes no farther,"</p>
                     <p>"Sacred as a confeſſion!" ſaid Schedoni, croſſing himſelf.</p>
                     <p>"I know not,"—reſumed the Marcheſa, and heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated; "I know not"—ſhe repeated in a yet lower voice, "how this girl may be diſpoſed of; and this it is which diſtracts my mind."</p>
                     <p>"I marvel much at that," ſaid Schedoni. "With opinions ſo ſingularly juſt, with a mind ſo accurate, yet ſo bold as you have diſplayed, is it poſſible that you
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:032735_0243_0FF4951D069B8F10"/>
can heſitate at what is to be done! You, my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will not prove yourſelf one of thoſe ineffectual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimers, who can think vigorouſly, but cannot act ſo! One way, only, remains for you to purſue, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inſtance; it is the ſame which your ſuperiour ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city pointed out, and taught me to approve. Is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for me to perſuade <hi>her,</hi> by whom I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced? There is only one way."</p>
                     <p>"And on that I have been long meditating," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Marcheſa, "and, ſhall I own my weakneſs? I cannot yet decide."</p>
                     <p>"My daughter! can it be poſſible that you ſhould want courage to ſoar above vulgar prejudice, in action, though not in opinion?" ſaid Schedoni, who, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his aſſiſtance was neceſſary to fix her fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating mind, gradually began to ſteal forth from the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reſerve, in which he had taken ſhelter.</p>
                     <p>"If this perſon was condemned by the law," he continued, "you would pronounce her ſentence to be juſt; yet you dare not, I am humbled while I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it, you dare not diſpenſe juſtice yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa, after ſome heſitation, ſaid, "I have not the ſhield of the law to protect me, father: and the boldeſt virtue may pauſe, when it reaches the utmoſt verge of ſafety."</p>
                     <p>"Never!" replied the Confeſſor, warmly; "vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue never trembles; it is her glory, and ſublimeſt attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to be ſuperior to danger, to deſpiſe it. The beſt principle is not virtue till it reaches this eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
                     <p>A philoſopher might, perhaps, have been ſurprized to hear two perſons ſeriouſly defining the limits of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, at the very moment in which they medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the moſt atrocious crime; a man of the world would have conſidered it to be mere hypocriſy; a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which might have diſcloſed his general know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of manners, but would certainly have betrayed his ignorance of the human heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="246" facs="unknown:032735_0244_0FF49570129AE4C8"/>
The Marcheſa was for ſome time ſilent and thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and then repeated, deliberately, "I have not the ſhield of the law to protect me."</p>
                     <p>"But you have the ſhield of the church," replied Schedoni; "you ſhould not only have protection, but abſolution."</p>
                     <p>"Abſolution!—Does virtue—juſtice, require ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution father?"</p>
                     <p>"When I mention abſolution for the action which you perceive to be ſo juſt and neceſſary," replied Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni, "I accommodated my ſpeech to vulgar preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and to vulgar weakneſs. And, forgive me, that ſince you, my daughter, deſcended from the loftineſs of your ſpirit to regret the ſhield of the law, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to conſole you, by offering a ſhield to conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But enough of this; let us return to argument. This girl is put out of the way of committing more miſchief, of injuring the peace and dignity of a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed family; ſhe is ſent to an eternal ſleep, before her time.—Where is the crime, where is the evil of this? On the contrary, you perceive, and you have convinced me, that it is only ſtrict juſtice, only ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence."</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa was attentive, and the confeſſor add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Speak low, father," ſaid the Marcheſa, though he ſpoke almoſt in a whiſper; "the cloiſter appears ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, yet ſome perſon may lurk behind thoſe pillars. Adviſe me how this buſineſs may be managed; I am ignorant of the particular means."</p>
                     <p>"There is ſome hazard in the accompliſhment of it I grant," replied Schedoni, "I know not whom you may confide in.—The men who make a trade of blood"—</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="247" facs="unknown:032735_0245_0FF4951E8C3E0498"/>
"Huſh!" ſaid the Marcheſa, looking round through the twilight—"a ſtep!"</p>
                     <p>"It is the Friar's, yonder, who croſſes to the choir," replied Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>They were watchful for a few moments, and then he reſumed the ſubject, "Mercenaries ought not to be truſted,"—</p>
                     <p>"Yet who but mercenaries"—interrupted the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa, and inſtantly checked herſelf. But the queſtion thus implied, did not eſcape the Confeſſor.</p>
                     <p>"Pardon my aſtoniſhment," ſaid he, "at the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency, or, what ſhall I venture to call it? of your opinions! After the acuteneſs you have diſplayed on ſome points, is it poſſible you can doubt, that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may both prompt and perform the deed? Why ſhould we heſitate to do what we judge to be right?"</p>
                     <p>"Ah! reverend father," ſaid the Marcheſa, with emotion, "but where ſhall we find another like your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf—another, who not only can perceive with juſtneſs, but will act with energy?"</p>
                     <p>Schedoni was ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"Such a friend is above all eſtimation; but where ſhall we ſeek him?"</p>
                     <p>"Daughter!" ſaid the monk, emphatically, "my zeal for your family is above all calculation."</p>
                     <p>"Good father," replied the Marcheſa, comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his full meaning, "I know not how to thank you."</p>
                     <p>"Silence is ſometimes eloquence," ſaid Schedoni, ſignificantly.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa muſed, for her conſcience alſo was eloquent. She tried to overcome its voice, but it would be heard; and ſometimes ſuch ſtarts of horrible conviction came over her mind, that ſhe felt as one who, awaking from a dream, opens his eyes only to meaſure the depth of the precipice on which he totters In ſuch moments ſhe was aſtoniſhed, that ſhe had pauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:032735_0246_0FF495788DB9C758"/>
for an inſtant upon a ſubject ſo terrible as that of murder. The ſophiſtry of the confeſſor, together with the inconſiſtencies he had betrayed, and which had not eſcaped the notice of the Marcheſa, even at the time they were uttered, though ſhe had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcious of her own, then became more ſtrongly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and ſhe almoſt determined to ſuffer the poor Ellena to Live. But returning paſſion, like a wave that has recoiled from the ſhore, afterwards came with recollected energy, and ſwept from her feeble mind, the barriers, which reaſon and conſcience had begun to rear.</p>
                     <p>"This confidence with which you have thought proper to honor me," ſaid Schedoni, at length, and pauſed; "This affair ſo momentous"—</p>
                     <p>"Ay, this affair," interrupted the Marcheſa, in a hurried manner,—"but when, and where, good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Being once convinced, I am anxious to have it ſettled."</p>
                     <p>"That muſt be as occaſion offers," replied the Monk, thoughtfully.—"On the ſhore of the Adriatic, in the province of Apulia; not far from Manfredonia, is a houſe that might ſuit the purpoſe. It is a lone dwelling on the beach, and concealed from travellers, among the foreſts which ſpread for many miles along the coaſt."</p>
                     <p>"And the people?" ſaid the Marcheſa.</p>
                     <p>"Ay, daughter, or why travel ſo far as Apulia? It is inhabited by one poor man, who ſuſtains a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exiſtence by fiſhing. I know him, and could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the reaſon of his ſolitary life;—but no matter, it is ſufficient that I <hi>know him.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>"And would truſt him, father?"</p>
                     <p>"Ay, lady, with the life of this girl—though ſcarcely with my own."</p>
                     <p>"How! If he is ſuch a villian he may not be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:032735_0247_0FF4952014499698"/>
think further. But now, you objected to a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary, yet this man is one!"</p>
                     <p>"Daughter, he may be truſted, when it is in ſuch a caſe; he is ſafe and ſure. I have reaſon to know him."</p>
                     <p>"Name your reaſons, father."</p>
                     <p>The Confeſſor was ſilent and his countenance aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a very peculiar character; it was more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than uſual, and overſpread with a dark, cadaverous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ue of mingled anger and guilt The Marcheſa ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed involuntarily as, paſſing by a window, the evening gleam that fell there, diſcovered it; and for the firſt time ſhe wiſhed, that ſhe had not committed herſelf ſo wholly to his power. But the die was now caſt; it was too late to be prudent; and ſhe again demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his reaſons.</p>
                     <p>"No matter," ſaid Schedoni, in a ſtifled voice—"ſhe dies!"</p>
                     <p>"By his hands?" aſked the Marcheſa, with ſtrong emotion. "Think, once more, father."</p>
                     <p>They were both again ſilent and thoughtful The Marcheſa, at length, ſaid, "Father, I rely upon your integrity and prudence;" and ſhe laid a very flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing emphaſis upon the word integrity. "But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you to let this buſineſs be finiſhed quickly; ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence is to me the purgatory of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> world, and not to truſt the accompliſhment of it to a ſecond perſon." She pauſed and then added, "I would not willingly owe ſo vaſt a debt of obligation to any other than yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>"Your requeſt, daughter, that I would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide this buſineſs to a ſecond perſon, ſaid Schedoni, with diſpleaſure, "cannot be accorded to. Can you ſuppoſe, that I myſelf"—</p>
                     <p>"Can I doubt that principle may both prompt and perform the deed," interrupted the Marcheſa with quicneſs, and anticipating his meaning, while
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:032735_0248_0FF4957A26BFAD80"/>
ſhe retorted upon him his former words. "Why ſhould we heſitate to do what we judge to be right?"</p>
                     <p>The ſilence of Schedoni alone indicated his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, which the Marcheſa immediately underſtood.</p>
                     <p>"Conſider, good father," ſhe added ſignificantly, "how painful it muſt be to me, to owe ſo infinite an obligation to a ſtranger, or to any other than ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valued a friend as yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>Schedoni, while he detected her meaning, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded himſelf that he diſpiſed the flattery, with which ſhe ſo thinly veiled it, unconſciouſly ſuffered his ſelf-love to be ſoothed by the compliment. He bowed his head, in ſignal of conſent to her wiſh.</p>
                     <p>"Avoid violence, if that be poſſible," ſhe added, immediately comprehending him, "but let her di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> quickly! The puniſhment is due to the crime."</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa happened, as ſhe ſaid this, to caſt her eyes upon the inſcription over a Confeſſional, where appeared, in black letters, theſe awful words, <hi>"God hears thee!"</hi> It appeared an awful warning. Her countenance changed; it had ſtruck upon her heart. Schedoni was too much engaged by his own thoughts to obſerve, or underſtand her ſilence. She ſoon recovered herſelf; and conſidering that this was a common inſcription for Confeſſionals, diſregarded what ſhe at firſt conſidered as a peculiar admonition; yet ſome moments elapſed, before ſhe could renew the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>"You were ſpeaking of a place, father," reſumed the Marcheſa—"you mentioned a"—</p>
                     <p>"Ay," muttered the Confeſſor, ſtill muſing—"in a chamber of that houſe there is"—</p>
                     <p>"What noiſe is that?" ſaid the Marcheſa, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him. They liſtened. A few low and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous notes of the organ ſounded at a diſtance, and ſtopped again.</p>
                     <p>"What mournful muſic is that?" ſaid the Marche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:032735_0249_0FF495C2CDC09D58"/>
in a faultering voice, "It was touched by a fearful hand! Veſpers were over long ago."</p>
                     <p>"Daughter," ſaid Schedoni, ſomewhat ſternly, "you ſaid a man's courage. Alas! you have a woman's heart."</p>
                     <p>"Excuſe me father; I know not why I feel this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, but I will command it. That chamber?"—</p>
                     <p>"In that chamber," reſumed the Confeſſor, "is a ſecret door, conſtructed long ago."—</p>
                     <p>"And for what purpoſe conſtructed?" ſaid the fearful Marcheſa.</p>
                     <p>"Pardon me daughter; 'tis ſufficient that it is there: we will make a good uſe of it. Through that door—in the night—when ſhe ſleeps"—</p>
                     <p>"I comprehend you," ſaid the Marcheſa, "I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend you. But why, you have your reaſons, no doubt, but why the neceſſity of a ſecret door in a houſe which you ſay is ſo lonely—inhabited by only one perſon?"</p>
                     <p>"A paſſage leads to the ſea," continued Schedoni, without replying to the queſtion. "There, on the ſhore, when darkneſs covers it; there, plunged amidſt the waves, no ſtain ſhall hint of"—</p>
                     <p>"Hark!" interrupted the Marcheſa, ſtarting, "that note again!"</p>
                     <p>The organ ſounded faintly from the choir, and pauſed, as before. In the next moment a flow chaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of voices was heard, mingling with the riſing peal, in a ſtrain particularly melancholy and ſolemn.</p>
                     <p>"Who is dead?" ſaid the Marcheſa, changing countenance; "it is a requiem!"</p>
                     <p>"Peace be with the departed!" exclaimed Schedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, and croſſed himſelf; "Peace reſt with his ſoul!"</p>
                     <p>"Hark! to that chaunt!" ſaid the Marcheſa, in a trembling voice; "it is a firſt requiem; the ſoul has but juſt quitted the body!"</p>
                     <p>They liſtened in ſilence. The Marcheſa was much
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:032735_0250_0FF4957BAE242240"/>
affected; her complexion varied at every inſtant; her breathings were ſhort and interrupted, and ſhe even ſhed a few tears, but they were thoſe of deſpair, rather than of ſorrow. "That body is now cold," ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "which but an hour ago was warm and animated! Thoſe fine ſenſes are cloſed in death! And to this condition would I reduce a being like myſelf! Oh, wretched, wretched mother! to what has the folly of a ſon reduced thee."</p>
                     <p>She turned from the Confeſſor, and walked alone in the cloiſter. Her agitation encreaſed; ſhe wept without reſtraint, for her veil and the evening gloom concealed her, and her ſighs were loſt amidſt the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic of the choir,</p>
                     <p>Schedoni was ſcarcely leſs diſturbed, but his were emotions of apprehenſion and contempt. "Behold, what is woman!" ſaid he—"The ſlave of her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the dupe of her ſenſes! When pride and revenge ſpeak in her breaſt, ſhe defies obſtacles, and laughs at crimes! Aſſail but her ſenſes, let muſic, for inſtance, touch the feeble chord of her heart, and echo to her fancy, and lo! all her perceptions change:—ſhe ſhrinks from an act ſhe had but an inſtant before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved meritorious, yields to ſome new emotion, and ſinks—the victim of a ſound! O, weak and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible being!"</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa, at leaſt ſeemed to juſtify his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations. The deſperate paſſions, which had reſiſted every remonſtrance of reaſon and humanity, were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed only by other paſſions; and her ſenſes touched by the mournful melody of muſic, and her ſuperſtitious fears awakened by the occurrence of a requiem for the dead, at the very moment when ſhe was planning murder, ſhe yielded, for a while, to the united influence of pity and terror. Her agitation did not ſubſide; but ſhe returned to the Confeſſor.</p>
                     <p>"We will converſe on this buſineſs at ſome future
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:032735_0251_0FF495C453F033C8"/>
time." ſaid ſhe; "at preſent, my ſpirits are diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Good night, father! Remember me in your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons."</p>
                     <p>"Peace, be with you, Lady!" ſaid the confeſſor, bowing gravely. "You ſhall not be forgotten. Be reſolute, and yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa beckoned her woman to approach, when, drawing her veil cloſer and, leaning upon the attendant's arm, ſhe left the cloiſter, Schedoni re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for a moment on the ſpot, looking after her, till her figure was loſt in the gloom of the long per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective; he then with thoughtful ſteps, quitted the cloiſter by another door. He was diſappointed, but he did not diſpair.</p>

                     <p>WHILE the Marcheſa and the monk were thus meditating conſpiraces againſt Ellena, ſhe was ſtill in the Urſaline convent on the lake of Celano. In this obſcure ſanctuary, indiſpoſition, the conſequence of the long and ſevere anxiety ſhe had ſuffered, compelled her to remain. A fever was on her ſpirits, and an univerſal laſſitude prevailed over her frame; which became the more effectual, from her very ſolicitude to conquer it. Every approaching day ſhe hoped ſhe ſhould be able to purſue her journey homeward, yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day found her as incapable of traveling as the laſt, and the ſecond week was already gone, before the fine air of Celano, and the tranquility of her aſylum, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to revive her. Vivaldi who was her daily viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor at the grate of the convent, and who, watching, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her with intenſe ſolicitude, had hitherto forborne to renew a ſubject, which, by agitating her ſpirits, might affect her health, now, that her health ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, ventured gradually to mention his fears leſt the place of her retreat ſhould be diſcovered, and leſt he yet might irrecoverably loſe her, unleſs ſhe would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of their ſpeedy marriage. At every viſit he now urged the ſubject, repreſented the dangers that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:032735_0253_0FF495C5DC0A8338"/>
them; and repeated his arguments and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties; for now, when he believed that time was preſſing forward fatal evils, he could no longer attend to the delicate ſcruples, that bade him be ſparing in intreaty. Ellena, had ſhe obeyed the dictates of her heart, would have rewarded his attachment and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices by a frank approbation of his propoſal; but the objections which reaſon exhibited againſt ſuch a conceſſion, ſhe could neither overcome or diſregard.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, after he had again repreſented their preſent dangers, and claimed the promiſe of her hand, received in the preſence of her deceaſed relative, Signora Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anchi, gently ventured to remind her, that an event as ſudden as lamentable, had firſt deferred their nuptials, and that if Bianchi had lived, Ellena would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, long ſince, the vows he now ſolicited. Again he intreated her, by every ſacred and tender recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to conclude the fearful uncertainty of their fate, and to beſtow upon him the right to protect her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ventured forth from this temporary aſylum.</p>
                     <p>Ellena immediately admitted the ſacredneſs of the promiſe, which ſhe had formerly given, and aſſured Vivaldi that ſhe conſidered herſelf as indiſſolubly bound to wed him as if it had been given at the altar; but ſhe objected to a confirmation of it, till his family ſhould ſeem willing to receive her for their daughter; when forgetting the injuries ſhe had received from them, ſhe would no longer refuſe their alliance. She added, that Vivaldi ought to be more jealous of the dignity of the woman, whom he honoured with his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem, than to permit her making a greater conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion..</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi felt the full force of this appeal; he recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, with anguiſh, circumſtances of which ſhe was happily ignorant, but which ſerved to ſtrengthen with him the juſtneſs of her reproof. And, as the aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Marcheſa had thrown upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                           <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:032735_0254_0FF4957D37FBD538"/>
crowed to his memory, pride and indignation ſwelled his heart, and ſo far overcame apprehenſion of hazard, that he formed a momentary reſolution to abandon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very other conſideration, to that of aſſerting the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect which was due to Ellena, and to forbear claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her for his wife, till his family ſhould make an acknowledgment of their error, and willingly admit her in the rank of their child. But this reſolution was as tranſient as plauſible; other conſiderations, and former fears preſſed upon him. He perceived the ſtrong improbability, that they would ever make a voluntary ſacrifice of their pride to his love; or yield miſtakes, nurtured by prejudice, and by willing indulgence, to truth and a ſenſe of juſtice. In the mean time, the plans, which would be formed for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating him from Ellena, might ſucceed, and he ſhould loſe her for ever. Above all, it appeared, that the beſt, the only method, which remained for confut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the daring aſperſions that had affected her name, was, by proving the high reſpect he himſelf felt for her, and preſenting her to the world in the ſacred cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of his wife. Theſe conſiderations quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined him to perſevere in his ſuit; but it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to urge them to Ellena, ſince the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they muſt unfold, would not only ſhock her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and afflict her heart, but would furniſh the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per pride ſhe cheriſhed with new arguments againſt approaching a family, who had thus groſsly inſulted her.</p>
                     <p>While theſe conſiderations occupied him, the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they occaſioned did not eſcape Ellena's obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it increaſed, as he reflected on the impoſſibility of urging them to her, and on the hopeleſsneſs of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing with her, unleſs he could produce new argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his favour. His unaffected diſtreſs awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all her tenderneſs and gratitude; ſhe aſked herſelf whether ſhe ought any longer to aſſert her own rights,
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:032735_0255_0FF495C84E5098B8"/>
when by doing ſo, ſhe ſacrificed the peace of him, who had incurred ſo much danger for her ſake, who had reſcued her from ſevere oppreſſion, and had ſo long and ſo well proved the ſtrength of his affection.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe applied theſe queſtions, ſhe appeared to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an unjuſt and ſelfiſh being, unwilling to make any ſacrifice for the tranquility of him, who had given her liberty, even at the riſk of his life. Her very vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, now that they were carried to exceſs, ſeemed to her to border on vices; her ſenſe of dignity appeared, to be narrow pride; her delicacy weakneſs; her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated affection cold ingratitude; and her circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, little leſs than prudence degenerated into meanneſs.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, as apt in admitting hope as fear, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately perceived her reſolution beginning to yield, and he urged again every argument which was likely to prevail over it. But the ſubject was too important for Ellena, to be immediately decided upon; he depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a faint aſſurance of encouragement; and ſhe forbade him to return till the following day, when ſhe would acquaint him with her final determination.</p>
                     <p>This interval was, perhaps, the moſt painful he had ever experienced. Alone, and on the banks of the lake, he paſſed many hours in alternate hope and fear; in endeavouring to anticipate the deciſion, on which ſeemed ſuſpended all his future peace, and abruptly recoiling from it, as often as imagination repreſented it to be adverſe.</p>
                     <p>Of the walls, that encloſed her he ſcarcely ever loſt ſight; the view of them ſeemed to cheriſh his hopes, and, while he gazed upon their rugged ſurface, Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na alone was pictured on his fancy; till his anxiety to learn her diſpoſition towards him aroſe to agony, and he would abruptly leave the ſpot. But an inviſible ſpell ſtill ſeemed to attract him back again, and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:032735_0256_0FF49587F2D57938"/>
found him pacing ſlowly beneath the ſhade of thoſe melancholy boundaries that concealed his Ellena.</p>
                     <p>Her day was not more tranquil. Whenever pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and decorous pride forbade her to become a member of the Vivaldi family, as conſtantly did gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, affection, irreſiſtible tenderneſs plead the cauſe of Vivaldi. The memory of paſt times returned; and the very accents of the deceaſed ſeemed to murmur from the grave, and command her to fulfil the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which had ſoothed the dying moments of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anchi.</p>
                     <p>On the following morning, Vivaldi was at the gates of the convent, long before the appointed hour, and he lingered in dreadful impatience, till the clock ſtruck the ſignal for his entrance.</p>
                     <p>Ellena was already in the parlour; ſhe was alone, and roſe in diſorder on his approach. His ſteps faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, his voice was loſt, and his eyes only, which he fixed with a wild earneſtneſs on her's, had power to inquire her reſolution. She obſerved the paleneſs of his countenance, and his emotion, with a mixture of concern and approbation. At that moment, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her ſmile, and hold out her hand to him; and fear, care, and doubt vaniſhed at once from his mind. He was incapable of thanking her, but ſighed deeply as he preſſed her hand, and, overcome with joy, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported himſelf againſt the grate that ſeparated them.</p>
                     <p>"You are, then, indeed my own!" ſaid Vivaldi, at length recovering his voice—"We ſhall be no more parted—you are mine for ever! But your countenance changes! O heaven! ſurely I have not miſtaken! Speak! I conjure you, Ellena; relieve me from theſe terrible doubts!"</p>
                     <p>"I am yours, Vivaldi," replied Ellena faintly, "op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion can part us no more."</p>
                     <p>She wept, and drew her veil over her eyes,</p>
                     <p>"What mean thoſe tears?" ſaid Vivaldi, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm.
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:032735_0257_0FF495D1CD93B158"/>
"Ah! Ellena," he added in a ſoftened voice, "ſhould tears mingle with ſuch moments as theſe! <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ould your tears fall upon my heart now! They tell me, that your conſent is given with reluctance—with grief; that your love is feeble, your heart—yes Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na! that your whole heart is no longer mine!"</p>
                     <p>"They ought rather to tell you," replied Ellena, "that it is all your own; that my affection never was more powerful than now, when it can overcome every conſideration with reſpect to your family, and urge me to a ſtep which muſt degrade me in their eyes.—and, I fear, in my own,"</p>
                     <p>"O retract that cruel aſſertion!" interrupted Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, "Degrade you in your own!—degrade you in their eyes!" He was much agitated; his countenance was fluſhed, and air of more than uſual dignity dilat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his figure,</p>
                     <p>"The time ſhall come, my Ellena." he added with energy, "when they ſhall underſtand your worth, and acknowledge your excellence. O! that I were an Emperor, that I might ſhew to all the world how much I love and honour you!"</p>
                     <p>Ellena gave him her hand, and, withdrawing her veil, ſmiled on him through her tears, with gratitude and reviving courage.</p>
                     <p>Before Vivaldi retired to the convent, he obtained her conſent to conſult with an aged Benedictine, whom he had engaged in his intereſt, as to the hour in which the marriage might be ſolemnized with leaſt obſervation. The prieſt informed him, that at the concluſion of the veſper-ſervice, he ſhould be diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for ſeveral hours; and that, as the firſt hour after ſun-ſet was more ſolitary than any other, the brotherhood being then aſſembled in the refactory, he would meet Vivaldi and Ellena at that time, in a chapel on the edge of the lake, a ſhort diſtance from
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:032735_0258_0FF585131E8172C0"/>
the Benedictiue convent, to which it belonged, and celebrate their nuptials.</p>
                     <p>With this propoſal, Vivaldi immediately returned to Ellena; when it was agreed that the party ſhould aſſemble by the hour mentioned by the prieſt. Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, who had thought it proper to mention her inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Abbeſs of the Urſalines, was, by her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to be attended by a lay-ſiſter; and Vivaldi was to meet her without the walls, and conduct her to the altar. When the ceremony was over, the fuji<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives were to embark in a veſſel, hired for the purpoſe, and croſſing the lake, proceed towards Naples. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi again withdrew to engage a boat, and Ellena to prepare for the continuance of her journey.</p>
                     <p>As the appointed hour drew near, her ſpirits ſunk, and ſhe watched with melancholy foreboding, the ſun retiring amidſt ſtormy clouds, and his rays fading from the higheſt points of the mountains, till the gloom of twilight prevailed over the ſcene. She then left her apartment, took a grateful leave of the hoſpitable Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs, and, attended by the lay-ſiſter, quitted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
                     <p>Immediately without the gate ſhe was met by Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, whoſe looks, as he put her arm within his, gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproached her for the dejection of her air.</p>
                     <p>They walked in ſilence towards the chapel of San Sebaſtian. The ſcene appeared to ſympathize with the ſpirits of Ellena. It was a gloomy evening, and the lake, which broke in dark waves upon the ſhore, mingled its hollow ſounds with thoſe of the wind, that bowed the lofty pines, and ſwept in guſts among the rocks. She obſerved with alarm the heavy thunder clouds, that rolled along the ſides of the mountains and the birds circling ſwiftly over the waters, and ſcudding away to their neſts among the cliffs; and ſhe noticed to Vivaldi, that, as a ſtorm ſeemed approaching, ſhe wiſhed to avoid croſſing the lake. He immediately
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:032735_0259_0FF495D4DD4871D8"/>
ordered Paulo to diſmiſs the boat, and to be in waiting with a carriage, that, if the weather ſhould become clear, they might not be detained longer than was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>As they approached the chapel, Ellena fixed her eyes on the mournful cypreſſes which waved over it, and ſighed. "Thoſe," ſhe ſaid, "are funeral mementos—not ſuch as ſhould grace the altar of marriage! Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, I could be ſuperſtitious.—Think you not they are portentous of future misfortune? But forgive me my ſpirits are weak,"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi endeavoured to ſoothe her mind, and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproached her for the ſadneſs ſhe indulged. Thus they entered the chapel. Silence, and a kind of gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſepulchral light prevailed within. The venerable Benedictine, with a brother, who was to ſerve as guardian to the bride, were already there, but they were kneeling, and engaged in prayer.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi led the trembling Ellena to the altar, where they waited till the Benedictines ſhould have finiſhed, and theſe were moments of great emotion. She often looked round the duſky chapel, in fearful expectation of diſcovering ſome lurking obſerver; and though ſhe knew it to be very improbable, that any perſon in this neighbourhood could be intereſted in interrupting the ceremony, her mind involuntarily admitted the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of it. Once, indeed, as her eyes glanced over a caſement, Ellena fancied ſhe diſtinguiſhed a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man face laid cloſe to the glaſs, as if to watch what was paſſing within; but when ſhe looked again, the apparition was gone. Notwithſtanding this, ſhe liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with anxiety to the uncertain ſounds without, and ſometimes ſtarted as the ſurges of the lake daſhed over the rock below, almoſt believing ſhe heard the ſteps and whiſpering voices of men in the avenues of the chapel. She tried, however, to ſubdue apprehenſion, by conſidering, that if this were true, an harmleſs cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:032735_0260_0FF46EAFE9C4B020"/>
might have attracted ſome inhabitants of the convent hither, and her ſpirits became more compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till ſhe obſerved a door open a little way, and a dark countenance looking from behind it. In the next inſtant it retreated, and the door was cloſed.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, who perceived Ellena's complexion change, as ſhe laid her hand on his arm, followed her eyes to the door, but no perſon appearing, he enquired the cauſe of her alarm.</p>
                     <p>"We are obſerved," ſaid Ellena, "ſome perſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at that door!"</p>
                     <p>"And if we are obſerved, my love," replied Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, "who is there in this neighbourhood whoſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation we can have reaſon to fear? Good father, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch," he added, turning to the prieſt, "you forget that we are waiting."</p>
                     <p>The officiating prieſt made a ſignal that he had nearly concluded his oriſon; but the other brother roſe immediately, and ſpoke with Vivaldi, who deſired that the doors of the chapel might be faſtened to prevent intruſion.</p>
                     <p>"We dare not bar the gates of this holy temple," replied the Benedictine, "it is a ſanctuary, and never may be cloſed."</p>
                     <p>"But you will allow me to repreſs idle curioſity," ſaid Vivaldi, "and to enquire who watches beyond that door? The tranquility of this lady demands thus much."</p>
                     <p>The brother aſſented, and Vivaldi ſtepped to the door; but perceiving no perſon in the obſcure paſſage beyond, it, he returned with lighter ſteps to the altar, from which the officiating prieſt now roſe.</p>
                     <p>"My children," ſaid he, "I have made you wait,—but an old man's prayers are not leſs important than a young man's vows, though this is not a moment when you will admit that truth."</p>
                     <p>"I will allow whatever you pleaſe, good father."
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:032735_0261_0FF495D353875FD8"/>
replied Vivaldi, "if you will adminiſter thoſe vows, without further delay;—time preſſes."</p>
                     <p>The venerable prieſt took his ſtation at the altar, and opened the book. Vivaldi placed himſelf on his right hand, and with looks of anxious love, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to encourage Ellena, who with a dejected counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which her veil but ill concealed, and eyes fixed on the ground, learned on her attendant ſiſter. The figure and homely features of this ſiſter; the tall ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and harſh viſage of the brother, clothed in the grey habit of his order; the ſilvered head and placid phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomy of the officiating prieſt, enlighted by a gleam from the lamp above, oppoſed to the youthful grace and ſpirit of Vivaldi, and the milder beauty and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Ellena, formed altogether a group worthy of the pencil.</p>
                     <p>The prieſt had begun the ceremony, when a noiſe from without again alarmed Ellena, who obſerved the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> once cautiouſly opened, and a man bend forward his gigantic figure from behind it. He carried a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>orch, and its glare, as the door gradually encloſed, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered other perſons in the paſſage beyond, looking forward over his ſhoulder into the chapel. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                           <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of their dreſs inſtantly convinced Ellena that they were not inhabitants of the Benedictine convent, but ſome terrible meſſengers of evil. Her half-ſtifled ſhriek alarmed Vivaldi, who caught her before ſhe fell to the ground: but, as he had not faced the door, he did not underſtand the occaſion of her terror, till the ſudden ruſh of footſteps made him turn, when he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſeveral men armed, and very ſingularly habited, advancing towards the altar.</p>
                     <p>"Who is he that intrudes upon this ſanctuary?" he demanded ſternly, while he half roſe from the ground where Ellena had ſunk.</p>
                     <p>"What ſacrilegious footſteps," cried the prieſt, "thus rudely violate this holy place?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="264" facs="unknown:032735_0262_0FF49589785B98D8"/>
Ellena was now inſenſible; and the men continuing to advance, Vivaldi drew his ſword to protect her.</p>
                     <p>The prieſt and Vivaldi now ſpoke together, but the words of neither could be diſtinguiſhed, when a voice, tremendous from his loudneſs, like burſting thunder, diſſipated the cloud of myſtery."</p>
                     <p>"You Vincentio di Vivaldi, and of Naples." it ſaid, "and you Ellena di Roſalba, of the Villa Altieri, we ſummon you to ſurrender, in the name of the moſt holy Inquiſition!"</p>
                     <p>"The Inquiſition!" exclaimed Vivaldi, ſcarcely believing what he heard. "Here is ſome miſtake!"</p>
                     <p>The official repeated the ſummons, without deign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reply.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, yet more aſtoniſhed, added, "Do not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine you can ſo far impoſe upon my credulity, as that I can believe myſelf to have fallen within the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of the Inquiſition."</p>
                     <p>"You may believe what you pleaſe, Signor," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the chief Officer, "but you and that lady are our priſoners."</p>
                     <p>"Begone, impoſtor!" ſaid Vivaldi, ſpringing from the ground, where he had ſupported Ellena, or my ſword ſhall teach you to repent your audacity!"</p>
                     <p>"Do you inſult an officer of the inquiſition!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the ruffian. "That holy Community will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you what you incur by reſiſting its mandate."</p>
                     <p>The prieſt interrupted Vivaldi's retort. "If you are really officers of that tremendous tribunal," he ſaid, "produce ſome proof of your office. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this place is ſanctified, and tremble for the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of impoſition. You do wrong to believe, that will deliver up to you perſons who have taken refuge here, without an unequivocal demand from that dread power."</p>
                     <p>"Produce your form of ſummons," demanded Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, with haughty impatience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="265" facs="unknown:032735_0263_0FF495D663047E28"/>
"It is here," replied the official, drawing forth a black ſcroll, which he delivered to the prieſt, "Read and be ſatisfied!"</p>
                     <p>The Benedictine ſtarted the inſtant he beheld the ſcroll, but he received and deliberately examined it. The kind of parchment, the impreſſion of the ſeal, the particular form of words, the private ſignals, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood only by the initiated—all announced this to be a true inſtrument of arreſtation from the <hi>Holy Office.</hi> The ſcroll dropped from his hand, and he fixed his eyes, with ſurprize and unalterable compaſſion, upon Vivaldi, who ſtopped to reach the parchment, when it was ſnatched by the official.</p>
                     <p>"Unhappy young man!" ſaid the prieſt, "it is too true; you are ſummoned by that awful power, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to your crime, and I am ſpared from the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a terrible offence!"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi appeared thunderſtruck. "For what crime, holy father, am I called upon to anſwer? This is ſome bold and artful impoſture, ſince it can delude even you? What crime—what offence?"</p>
                     <p>"I did not think you had been thus hardened in guilt!" replied the prieſt. "Forbear! add not the audacity of falſehood to the headlong paſſions of youth. You underſtand too well your crime."</p>
                     <p>"Falſehood!" retorted Vivaldi, "But your years, old man, and thoſe ſacred veſtments, protect you. For theſe ruffians, who have dared to implicate that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent victim," pointing to Ellena, "in the charge, they ſhall have juſtice from my vengeance."</p>
                     <p>"Forbear! forbear?" ſaid the prieſt, ſeizing his arm, "have pity on yourſelf and on her. Know you not the puniſhment you in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>"I know not, nor care," replied Vivaldi, "but I will defend Ellena di Roſalba to the laſt moment. Let them reproach if they dare."</p>
                     <p>"It is on her, on her who lies ſenſeleſs at your
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:032735_0264_0FF4958B03657220"/>
feet," ſaid the prieſt, "that they will wreak their ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance for theſe inſults; on her—the partner of your guilt."</p>
                     <p>"The partner of my guilt!" exclaimed Vivaldi, with mingled aſtoniſhment and indignation—"of my guilt."</p>
                     <p>"Raſh young man! does not the very veil ſhe wears betray it? I marvel how it could paſs my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation!"</p>
                     <p>"You have ſtolen a nun from her convent," ſaid the chief officer, "and muſt anſwer for the crime. When you have wearied yourſelf with theſe heroics, Signor, you muſt go with us; our patience is wearied already."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi obſerved, for the firſt time, that Ellena was ſhrouded in a nun's veil; it was the one which Olivia had lent, to conceal her from the notice of the Abbeſs, on the night of her departure from San Stefano, and which, in the hurry of that departure, ſhe had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to leave with the nun. During this interval, her mind had been too entirely occupied by cares and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion to allow her once to notice, that the veil ſhe wore was other than her uſual one; but it had been too well obſerved by ſome of the Urſaline ſiſters.</p>
                     <p>Though he knew not how to account for the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of the veil, Vivaldi began to perceive others which gave colour to the charge brought againſt him, and to aſcertain the wide circumference of the ſnare that was ſpread around him. He fancied, too, that he perceived the hand of Schedoni employed upon it, and that his dark ſpirit was now avenging itſelf for the expoſure he had ſuffered in the church of the Spirito Santo, and for all the conſequent mortifications. As Vivaldi was ignorant of the ambitious hopes which the Marcheſa had encouraged in father Schedoni, he did not ſee the improbability, that the Confeſſor would have dared to hazard her favour by this arreſt of her
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:032735_0265_0FF495E0D90194B0"/>
ſon; much leſs could he ſuſpect, that Schedoni, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done ſo, had ſecrets in his poſſeſſion, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled him ſafely to defy her reſentment, and bind her in ſilence to his decree.</p>
                     <p>With the conviction, that Schedoni was the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-hand that directed the preſent manoeuvre, Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di ſtood aghaſt, gazing in ſilent unutterable anguiſh on Ellena, who, as ſhe began to revive, ſtretched forth her helpleſs hands, and called upon him to ſave her, "Do not leave me," ſaid ſhe in accents the moſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating, "I am ſafe while you are with me."</p>
                     <p>At the ſound of her voice, he ſtarted from his trance, and turning fiercely on the ruffians, who ſtood in ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len watchfulneſs around, bade them depart, or prepare for his fury. At the ſame inſtant they all drew their ſwords, and the ſhrieks of Ellena, and the ſupplications of the officiating prieſt, were loſt amidſt the tumult of the combatants.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, moſt unwilling to ſhed blood, ſtood, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the defenſive, till the violence of his antagoniſts compelled him to exert all his ſkill and ſtrength. He then diſabled one of the ruffians; but his ſkill was inſufficient to repel the other two, and he was nearly overcome, when ſteps were heard approaching, and Paulo ruſhed into the chapel. Perceiving his maſter beſet, he drew his ſword, and came furiouſly to his aid. He fought with unconquerable audacity and fierceneſs, till nearly at the moment when his adverſary fell, other ruffians entered the chapel, and Vivaldi with his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervant was wounded, and, at length diſarmed.</p>
                     <p>Ellena, who had been withheld from throwing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf between the combatants, now, on obſerving that Vivaldi was wounded, renewed her efforts for liberty, accompanied by ſuch agony of ſupplication and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, as almoſt moved to pity the hearts of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding ruffians.</p>
                     <p>Diſabled by his wounds, and alſo held by his enemies,
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:032735_0266_0FF4959577A748B0"/>
Vivaldi was compelled to witneſs her diſtreſs and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, without a hope of reſcuing her. In frantic ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents he called upon the old prieſt to protect her.</p>
                     <p>"I dare not oppoſe the orders of the Inquiſition," replied the Benedictine, "even if I had ſufficient ſtrength to defy its officials. Know you not, unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py young man, that it is death to reſiſt them?"</p>
                     <p>"Death!" exclaimed Ellena, "death!"</p>
                     <p>"Ay lady, too ſurely ſo?"</p>
                     <p>"Signor, it would have been well for you," ſaid one of the officers, "if you had taken my advice: you will pay dearly for what you have done," pointing to the ruffian who lay ſeverely wounded on the ground.</p>
                     <p>"My maſter will not have that to pay for, friend," ſaid Paulo, "for if you muſt know, that is a piece of my work; and, if my arms were now at liberty, I would try if I could not match it among one of you, though I am ſo flaſhed,"</p>
                     <p>"Peace, good Paulo! the deed was mine," ſaid Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi; then addreſſing the official, "For myſelf I care not, I have done my duty—but for her!—Can you, look upon her, innocent and helpleſs as ſhe is, and not relent! Can you, will you, barbarains! drag her, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to deſtruction upon a charge too ſo daringly falſe?"</p>
                     <p>"Our relenting would be of no ſervice to her," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the official, we muſt do our duty. Whether the charge is true or falſe, ſhe muſt anſwer to it before her judges."</p>
                     <p>"What charge demanded Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"The charge of having broken your nun's vows." replied the prieſt.</p>
                     <p>Ellena raiſed her eyes to heaven; "Is it even ſo!" ſhe exclaimed.</p>
                     <p>"You hear ſhe acknowledges the crime," ſaid one of the ruffians.</p>
                     <p>"She acknowledges no crime," replied Vivaldi; "ſhe only perceives the extent of the malice that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:032735_0267_0FF495E262C0BE68"/>
her. O! Ellena muſt, I then abandon you to their power! leave you for ever!"</p>
                     <p>The agony of this thought re-animated him with momentary ſtrength; he burſt from the graſp of the officials, and once more claſped Ellena to his boſom, who, unable to ſpeak, wept, with the anguiſh of a breaking heart, as her head ſunk upon his ſhoulder. The ruffians around them ſo far reſpected their grief, that, for a moment, they did not interrupt it.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi's exertion was tranſient; faint from ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and from loſs of blood, he became unable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himſelf, and was compelled again to relinquiſh Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"Is there no help?" ſaid ſhe, with agony; "will you ſuffer him to expire on the ground?"</p>
                     <p>The prieſt directed, that he ſhould be conveyed to the Benedictine convent, where his wounds might be examined, and medical aid adminiſtered. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled ruffians were already carried thither; but Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di refuſed to go, unleſs Ellena might accompany him. It was contrary to the rules of the place, that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould enter it, and before the prieſt could reply, his Benedictine brother eagerly ſaid that they dared not tranſgreſs the law of the convent.</p>
                     <p>Ellena's fears for Vivaldi entirely overcame thoſe for herſelf, and ſhe entreated, that he would ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be conveyed to the Benedictines; but he could not be prevailed with to leave her. The officials, however, prepared to ſeparate them; Vivaldi in vain urged the uſeleſs cruelty of dividing him from Ellena, if, as they had hinted, ſhe alſo was to be carried to the Inquiſition; and as ineffectually demanded, whither they really deſigned to take her.</p>
                     <p>"We ſhall take good care of her, Signor," ſaid an officer, "that is ſufficient for you, It ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whether you are going the ſame way, you muſt not go together."</p>

"Why, did you ever hear, Signor, of arreſted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being ſuffered to remain in company?', ſaid ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ruffian, "Fine plots they would lay; I warrant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"You ſhall not ſeperate me from my maſter though," vociferated Paulo; "I demand to be ſent to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition with him, or to the devil, but all is one for that."</p>
                     <p>"Fair and ſoftly," replied the officer; "you ſhall be ſent to the Inquiſition firſt, and to the devil after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; you muſt be tried before you are condemned.'</p>
                     <p>"But waſte no more time," he added to his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, and pointing to Ellena, "away with her."</p>
                     <p>As he ſaid this they lifted Ellena in their arms.—"Let me looſe!" cried Paulo, when he ſaw they were carrying her from the place, "let me looſe, I ſay!" and the violence of his ſtruggles burſt aſunder the cords which held him; a vain releaſe, for he was inſtantly ſeized again.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, already exhauſted by the loſs of blood and the anguiſh of his mind, made however, a laſt effort to ſave her; he tried to raiſe himſelf from the ground, hut a ſudden film came over his ſight, and his ſenſes forſook him, while yet the name of Ellena faultered on his lips,</p>
                     <p>As they bore her from the chapel, ſhe continued to call upon Vivaldi, and alternately to ſupplicate that ſhe might once more behold him, and take one laſt adieu. The ruffians were inexorable and ſhe heard his voice no more, for he no longer heard—no longer was able to reply to her's.</p>
                     <p>"O! once again!" ſhe cried in agony, "One word, Vivaldi! Let me hear the ſound of your voice yet once again!" But it was ſilent.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe quitted the chapel, with eyes ſtill bent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſpot where he lay, ſhe exclaimed in the

piercing accents of deſpair, "Farewel, Vivaldi!—O! for ever—ever, farewel!"</p>
                     <p>The tone, in which ſhe pronounced the laſt "fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel!" was ſo touching, that even the cold heart of the prieſt could not reſiſt it; but he impatiently wiped away the few tears, that ruſhed into his eyes, before they were obſerved.

All ſuffering, all efforts, all reſiſtance were vain; the ruffians bound him bleeding as he was, and conveyed him to the Benedictine convent, together with the wounded Paulo, who unceaſingly vociferated on the way thither.

                     <p>THE wounds of Vivaldi, and of his ſervant, were pronounced by the Benedictine, who had examined and dreſſed them, not to be dangerous, but thoſe of one of the ruffians were declared doubtful. Some few of the brothers diſplayed much compaſſion and kindneſs towards the priſoners; but the greater part ſeemed fearful of expreſſing any degree of ſympathy for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who had fallen within the cognizance of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office, and even kept aloof from the chamber, in which they were confined. To this ſelf-reſtriction, however, they were not long ſubjected; for Vivaldi and Paulo were compelled to begin their journey as ſoon as ſome ſhort reſt had ſufficiently revived them. They were placed in the ſame carriage, but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of two officers prevented all interchange of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture as to the deſtination of Ellena, and with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the immediate occaſion of their misfortune. Paulo, indeed, now and then hazarded a ſurmiſe, and did not ſcruple to affirm, that the Abbeſs of San Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fano was their chief enemy; that the Carmelite friars, who had overtaken them on the road, were her agents; and that having traced their route, they had given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence where Vivaldi and Ellena might be found.</p>
                     <p>"I gueſſed we never ſhould eſcape the Abbeſs," ſaid Paulo, "though I would not diſturb you Signor Mio, nor the poor lady Ellena, by ſaying ſo. But your Abbeſſeſs are as cunning as Inquiſitors, and are
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:032735_0271_0FF495E570D7BD08"/>
ſo fond of governing that they had rather, like them, ſend a man to the devil, than ſend him no where.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi gave Paulo a ſignificant look, which was meant to repreſs his imprudent loquacity, and then ſunk again into ſilence and the abſtractions of deep grief. The officers, mean while, never ſpoke, but were obſervant of all that Paulo ſaid, who perceived their watchfulneſs, but becauſe he deſpiſed them as ſpies, he thoughtleſsly deſpiſed them alſo as enemies, and was ſo far from concealing opinions, which they might repeat to his prejudice, that he had a pride in exaggerating them, and in daring the worſt, which the exaſperated tempers of theſe men, ſhut up in the ſame carriage with him, and compelled to hear what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he choſe to ſay againſt the inſtitution to which they belonged, could effect. Whenever Vivaldi, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called from his abſtractions by ſome bold aſſertion, endeavoured to check his imprudence, Paulo was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſolace his conſcience, inſtead of protecting himſelf, by ſaying, "It is their own fault; they would thruſt themſelves into my company; let them have enough of it; and if ever they take me before their reverences, the Inquiſitiors, <hi>they</hi> ſhall have enough of it too. I will play up ſuch a tune in the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is not heard there every day. I will jingle all the bells on their fool's caps, and tell them a little honeſt truth, if they make me ſmart for it ever ſo."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, arouſed once more, and ſeriouſly alarmed for the conſequences which honeſt Paulo might be drawing upon himſelf, now inſiſted on his ſilence, and was obeyed.</p>
                     <p>They travelled during the whole night, ſtopping only to change horſes. At every poſt houſe, Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di looked for a carriage that might incloſe Ellena, but none appeared, nor any ſound of wheels told him that ſhe followed.</p>
                     <p>With the morning light he perceived the dome of
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:032735_0272_0FF495A5E5EB3EB0"/>
St. Peter appearing faintly over the plains that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded Rome and he underſtood, for the firſt time, that he was going to the priſons of the Inquiſition in that city. The travellers deſcended upon the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania, and then reſted for a few hours at a ſmall town on its borders.</p>
                     <p>When they again ſet forward, Vivaldi perceived that the guard was changed, the officer who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with him in the apartment of the inn, only appearing among the new faces which ſurrounded him, The dreſs and manners of theſe men differed conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erably from thoſe of the other. Their conduct was more temperate, but their countenances expreſſed darker cruelty, mingled with a ſly demureneſs, and a ſolemn ſelf-importance, that announced them at once as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Inquiſition.—They were almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably ſilent; and when they did ſpeak, it was only in a few ſententious words. To the abounding queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Paulo, and the few earneſt entreaties of his maſter, to be informed of the place of Ellena's deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, they made not the leaſt reply; and liſtened to all the flouriſhing ſpeeches of the ſervant againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors and the Holy Office with the moſt profound gravity.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi was ſtruck with the circumſtance of the guard being changed, and ſtill more with the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the party, who now compoſed it. When he compared the manners of the late, with thoſe of the preſent guard, he thought he diſcovered in the firſt the mere ferocity of ruffians; but in the latter, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of cunning and cruelty, which ſeemed particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to characterize Inquiſitors; he was inclined to believe, that a ſtratagem had enthralled him, and that now, for the firſt time, he was in the cuſtody of the <hi>Holy Office.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was near midnight when the priſoners entered the <hi>Porto del Popolo,</hi> and found themſelves in the
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:032735_0273_0FF495EFC1FF9CA8"/>
midſt of the Carnival at Rome. The <hi>Corſo,</hi> through which they were obliged to paſs, was crowded with gay carriages maſks, with proceſſions of muſicians, monks, and mountebanks, was lighted up with innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable flambeaux, and reſounded with the heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rattling of wheels, the muſic of ſerenaders, and the jokes and laughter of the revellers, as they ſportively threw about their ſugar-plumbs. The heat of the weather made it neceſſary to have the windows of the coach open; and the priſoners, therefore, ſaw all that paſſed without. It was a ſcene which contraſted cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty with the feelings and circumſtances of Vivaldi; torn as he was from her he moſt loved, in dreadful uncertainty as to her fate, and himſelf about to be brought before a tribunal, whoſe myſterious and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible proceedings appalled even the braveſt ſpirits. Altogether, this was one of the moſt ſtriking exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which the chequer-work of human life could ſhew, or human feelings endure. Vivaldi, ſickened as he looked upon the ſplendid crowd, while the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage made its way ſlowly with it; but Paulo, as he gazed, was reminded of the Corſo of Naples, ſuch as it appeared at the time of Carnival, and, comparing the preſent ſcene with his native one, he found fault with every thing he beheld. The dreſſes were taſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the equipages without ſplendor, the people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpirit; yet, ſuch was the propenſity of his heart to ſympatize with whatever was gay, that, for ſome moments, he forgot that he was a priſoner on his way to the Inquiſition; almoſt forgot that he was a Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan; and while he exclaimed againſt the dullneſs of a Roman Carnival, would have ſprung through the carriage window to partake of its ſpirit, if his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>etters and his wounds had not withheld him. A deep ſigh from Vivaldi recalled his wandering imagination; and when he noticed again the ſorrow in his maſter's look, all his lightly joyous ſpirits fled.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="276" facs="unknown:032735_0274_0FF4959A1721C890"/>
"My <hi>maeſtro</hi> my dear <hi>maeſtro!</hi>"—he ſaid, and knew not how to finiſh what he wiſhed to expreſs.</p>
                     <p>At that moment they paſſed the theatre of San Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, the doors of which were thronged with equipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, where Roman ladies, in their gala habits, courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n their fantaſtic dreſſes, and maſks of all deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were haſtening to the opera. In the midſt of this gay buſtle, where the carriage was unable to proceed, the officials of the Inquiſition looked on in ſolemn ſilence, not a muſcle of their features relaxing in ſympathy, or yielding a ſingle wrinkle of the ſelf-importance that lifted their brows; and, while they regarded with ſecret contempt, thoſe who could be thus lightly pleaſed, the people, in return, more wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, herhaps, regarded with contempt the proud mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſeneſs, that refuſed to partake of innocent pleaſures, becauſe they were trifling, and ſhrunk from counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances furrowed with the ſternneſs of cruelty. But when their office was diſtinguiſhed, part of the crowd preſſed back from the carriage in affright, while ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part advanced with curioſity; through, as the majority retreated, ſpace was left for the carriage to move on. After quitting the Corſo, it proceeded for ſome miles through dark and deſerted ſtreets, were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here and there a lamp, hung on high before the image of a ſaint, ſhed its glimmering light, and where a melancholy and univerſal ſilence prevailed. At in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, indeed, the moon, as the clouds paſſed away, ſhewed, for a moment, ſome of thoſe mighty monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Rome's eternal name, thoſe ſacred ruins, thoſe gigantic ſkeletons which once encloſed a ſoul, whoſe energies governed a world! Even Vivaldi could not behold with indifference the grandeur of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, as the rays fell upon the hoary walls and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, or paſs among theſe ſcences of ancient ſtory, without feeling a melancholy awe, a ſacred enthuſiaſm, that withdrew him from himſelf. But the illuſion
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:032735_0275_0FF495F1498D7AF8"/>
was tranſient; his own misfortunes preſſed too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily upon him to be long unfelt, and his enthuſiaſm vaniſhed like the moon light.</p>
                     <p>A returning gleam lighted up, ſoon after, the rude and extenſive area, which the carriage was croſſing. It appeared, from its deſolation, and the ruins ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered diſtantly along its ſkirts, to be a part of the city entirely abandoned by the modern inhabitants to the reliques of its former granduer. Not even the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a human being croſſed the waſte, nor any build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appeared, which might be ſuppoſed to ſhelter one. The deep tone of a bell, however, rolling on the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the night, announced the haunts of man to be not far off; and Vivaldi perceived in the diſtance, to which he was approaching, an extent of lofty walls and towers, that, as far as the gloom would permit his eye to penetrate, bounded the horizon. He judged theſe to be the priſons of the inquiſition. Paulo pointed them out at the ſame moment. "Ah, Signor!' ſaid he deſpondingly, "that is the place! what ſtrength! If, my Lord, the Marcheſe were but to ſee where we are going! Ah!"—</p>
                     <p>He concluded with a deep ſigh, and ſunk again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtate of apprehenſion and mute expectation, which he had ſuffered from the moment that he quit-th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Corſo.</p>
                     <p>The carriage having reached the walls, followed their bendings to a conſiderable extent. Theſe walls, of immenſe height, and ſtrengthened by innumerable maſſy bulwarks, exhibited neither window or grate, put a vaſt and dreary blank; a ſmall round tower only, perched here and there upon the ſummit, breaking their monotony,</p>
                     <p>The priſoners paſſed what ſeemed to be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal entrance, from the granduer of its portal, and the gigantic loftineſs of the towers that roſe over it; and after the carriage ſtopped at an arch-way in the walls,
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:032735_0276_0FF495A76D7826E8"/>
ſtrongly barricadoed. One of the eſcort alighted, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtruck upon the bars, a folding door within was immediately opened, and a man, bearing a torch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared behind the barricado, whoſe countenance, as he looked through it, might have been copied for the

of the poet.</p>
                     <p>No words were exchanged between him and the guard; but on perceiving who were without, he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the iron gate, and the priſoners having alighted, paſſed with the two officials beneath the arch, the guard following with a torch.—They deſcended a flight of broad ſteps, at the foot of which another iron gate admitted them to a kind of hall; ſuch, however, it at firſt appeared to Vivaldi, as his eyes glanced through its gloomy extent, imperfectly aſcertaining it by the lamp, which hung from the centre of the roof. No perſon appeared, and a death like ſilence prevailed; for neither the officials nor the guard yet ſpoke; nor did any diſtant ſound contradict the notion, that they were traverſing the chambers of the dead. To Vivaldi it occurred, that this was one if the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial vaults of the victims, who ſuffered in the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and his whole frame thrilled with horror. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral avenues, opening from the apartment, ſeemed to lead to diſtant quarters of this immenſe fabric, but ſtill no footſtep whiſpering along the pavement, or voice murmuring through the arched roofs, indicated it to be the reſidence of the living.</p>
                     <p>Having entered one of the paſſages, Vivaldi per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a perſon cloathed in black, and who bore a lighted taper, croſſing ſilently in the remote perſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and he underſtood too well from his habit, that he was a member of this dreadful tribunal.</p>
                     <p>The ſound of footſteps ſeemed to reach the ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for he turned, and, then pauſed while the officers advanced. They then made ſigns to each other, and
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:032735_0277_0FF495F2D0BFF6C0"/>
exchanged a few words, which neither Vivaldi or his ſervant could underſtand, when the ſtranger, pointing with his taper along another avenue, paſſed away. Vivaldi followed him with his eyes, till a door at the extremity of the paſſage opened, and he ſaw the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor enter an apartment, whence a great light pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and where ſeveral other figures habited like himſelf, appeared waiting to receive him. The door immediately cloſed; and, whether the imagination of Vivaldi was affected, or that the ſounds were real, he thought, as it cloſed, he diſtinguiſhed half-ſtifled groans, as of a perſon in agony.</p>
                     <p>The avenue, through which the priſoners paſſed, opened at length, into an apartment gloomy like the firſt they had entered, but more extenſive. The roof was ſupported by arches, and long arcades branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off from every ſide of the chamber, as from a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral point, and where loſt in the gloom, which the rays of the ſmall lamps, ſuſpended in each, but feebly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenetrated.</p>
                     <p>They reſted here, and a perſon ſoon after advanced, who appeared to be the jailor, into whoſe hands Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi and Paulo were delivered. A few myſterious words having been exchanged, one of the officials croſſed the hall and aſcended a wide ſtair-caſe, while the other, with the jailor and the guard, remained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as if awaiting his return.</p>
                     <p>A long interval elapſed, during which the ſtillneſs of the place was ſometimes interrupted by a cloſing door, and, at others, by indiſtinct ſounds, which yet appeared to Vivaldi like lamentations and extorted groans. Inquiſitors, in their long black robes, iſſued from time to time from the paſſages, and croſſed the hall to other avenues. They eyed the priſoners with curioſity, but without pity. Their viſages, with few exceptions, ſeemed ſtamped with the characters of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. Vivaldi could not look upon the grave cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:032735_0278_0FF495A8F475A830"/>
or the ferocious impatience, their countenances ſeverally expreſſed, without reading in them the fate of ſome fellow creature, the fate which theſe men ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed going, even at this moment, to confirm; and as they paſſed with ſoundleſs ſteps, he ſhrunk from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, as if their very look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> poſſeſſed ſome ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural power, and could have ſtruck death. But he followed their fleeting figures, as they proceeded on their work of horror, to where the laſt glimmering ray faded into darkneſs, expecting to ſee other doors of other chambers open to receive them. While meditating upon theſe horrors, Vivaldi loſt every ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh conſideration in aſtoniſhment and indignation of the ſufferings, which the frenzied wickedneſs of man prepares for man, who, even at the moment of inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inſults his victim with aſſertions of the juſtice and neceſſity of procedure. "Is this poſſible!" ſaid Vivaldi internally: "Can this be in human nature!—Can ſuch horrible perverſion of right be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted! Can man, who calls himſelf endowed with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and immeaſurably ſuperior to every other created being, argue himſelf into the commiſſion of ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible folly, ſuch inveterate cruelty, as exceeds all the acts of the moſt irrational and ferocious brute. Brutes do not deliberately ſlaughter their ſpecies; it remains for man only, man, proud of his prerogative of reaſon, and boaſting of his ſenſe of juſtice, to unite the moſt terrible extremes of folly and wickedneſs!"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi had been no ſtranger to the exiſtence of this tribunal; he had long underſtood the nature of the eſtabliſhment, and had often received particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of its cuſtoms and laws; but, though he had believed before, it was now only that conviction ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to impreſs his underſtanding. A new view of human nature ſeemed to burſt, at once, upon his mind, and he could not have experienced greater aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if this had been the firſt moment, in which he
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:032735_0279_0FF495F4577F26E8"/>
had heard of the inſtitution—But, when he thought of Ellena, conſidered that ſhe was in the power of this tribunal, and that it was probable ſhe was, at this moment within the ſame dreadful walls, grief, indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and deſpair irritated him almoſt to frenzy. He ſeemed ſuddenly animated with ſupernatural ſtrength and ready to attempt impoſſibilities for her deliverance. It was by a ſtrong effort for ſelf-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that he forbore burſting the bonds, which held him, and making a deſperate attempt to ſeek her through the vaſt extent of theſe priſons. Reflection, however, had not ſo entirely forſaken him, but that he ſaw the impoſſibility of ſucceeding in ſuch an effort the moment he had conceived it, and he forbore to ruſh upon the certain deſtruction to which it muſt have led. His paſſions, thus reſtrained, ſeemed to become virtues, and to diſplay themſelves in the energy of his courage and his fortitude. His ſoul became ſtern and vigorous in deſpair, and his manner and countenance aſſumed a calm dignity, which ſeemed to awe, in ſome degree, even his guards. The pain of his wounds was no longer felt; it appeared as if the ſtrength of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual ſelf had ſubdued the infirmities of the body, and, perhaps, in theſe moments of elevation, he could have endured the torture without ſhrinking.</p>
                     <p>Paulo, meanwhile, mute and grave, was watchful of all that paſſed; he obſerved the revolutions in his maſters mind, with grief firſt, and then with ſurprize, but he could imitate the noble fortitude, which now gave weight and ſteadineſs to Vivaldi's thoughts. And when he looked on the power and gloom around him. and on the viſages of the paſſing inquiſitors, he began to repent, that he had ſo freely delivered his opinion of this tribunal, in the preſence of tis agents, and to perceive, that if he played up the kind of tune he had threatened, it would probably be the laſt he ſhould ever be permitted to perform in this world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="282" facs="unknown:032735_0280_0FF495AA7B057B58"/>
At length, the chief officer deſcended the ſtair-caſe, and immediately bade Vivaldi follow him. Paulo was accompanying his maſter, but was withheld by the guard, and told he was to be diſpoſed of in a different way. This was the moment of his ſevereſt trial; he declared he would not be ſeparated from his maſter.</p>
                     <p>"What did I demand to be brought here for," he cried, "if it was not that I might go ſhares with the ſignor in all his troubles? This is not a place to come for pleaſure, I warrant; and I can promiſe ye, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I would not have come within a hundred miles of you, if it had not been for my maſter's ſake."</p>
                     <p>The guards roughly interrupted him, and were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying him away, when Vivaldi's commanding voice arreſted them. He returned to ſpeak a few words of conſolation to his faithful ſervant, and ſince they were to be ſeparated, to take leave of him.</p>
                     <p>Paulo embraced his knees, and, while he wept, and his words were almoſt ſtifled by ſobs, declared no force ſhould drag him from his maſter, while he had life; and repeatedly appealed to the guards, with—"what did I demand to be brought here for? Did ever any body come here to ſeek pleaſure? What right have you to prevent my going ſhares with my maſter in his troubles?"</p>
                     <p>"We do not intend to deny you that pleaſure, friend," replied one of the guards.</p>
                     <p>"Don't you? Then heaven bleſs you!" cried Paulo, ſpringing from his knees, and ſhaking the man by the hand with a violence, that would nearly have diſlocated the ſhoulder of a perſon leſs robuſt.</p>
                     <p>"So, come with us," added the guard, drawing him away from Vivaldi. Paulo now become outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous, and, ſtruggling with the guards, burſt from them, and again fell at the feet of his maſter, who raiſed and embraced him, endeavouring to prevail with
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:032735_0281_0FF495FDED954408"/>
him to ſubmit quietly to what was inevitable, and to encourage him with hope.</p>
                     <p>"I truſt that our ſeparation will be ſhort," ſaid Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, "and that we ſhall meet in happier circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, My innocence muſt ſoon appear."</p>
                     <p>"We ſhall never, never meet again, Signor-mio, in this world," ſaid Paulo, ſobbing violently, "ſo don't make me hope ſo. That old Abbeſs knows what ſhe is about too well to let us eſcape; or ſhe would not have catched us up ſo cunningly as ſhe did; ſo, what ſignifies innocence! O! if my old lord, the Marcheſe, did but know where we are!"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi interrupted him, and turning to the guards, ſaid, "I recommend my faithful ſervant to your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; he is innocent. It will ſome time, perhaps, be in my power to recompence you for any indulgence, you may allow him, and I ſhall value it a thouſand times more highly, than any you could ſhew to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf! Farewell, Paulo,—farewell! Officer, I am read."</p>
                     <p>"O ſtay! Signor, for one moment—ſtay," ſaid Paulo.</p>
                     <p>"We can wait no longer," ſaid the guard, and again drew Paulo away, who looking piteouſly after Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, alternately repeated, Farewell, dear maeſtro! farewell dear, dear maeſtro!" and "What did I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be brought here for?—What did I demand to be brought here for?—what was it for, if not to go ſhares with my maeſtro?" till Vivaldi was beyond the reach of ſight and of hearing.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, having followed the Officer up the ſtair-caſe, paſſed through a gallery to an antichamber, where, being delivered into the cuſtody of ſome perſons in waiting, his conductor diſappeared beyond a folding door, that led to an inner apartment. Over this door was an inſcription in Hebrew characters, traced in blood-colour. Dante's inſcription on the entrance of
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:032735_0282_0FF495B5B880C090"/>
the infernal regions, would have been ſuitable to a place, where every circumſtance and feature ſeemed to ſay, <hi>"Hope, that comes to all, comes not here!"</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Vivaldi conjectured that in this chamber, they were preparing for him the inſtruments which were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort a confeſſion; and though he knew little of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular proceedings of this tribunal, he had always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that the torture was inflicted upon the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed perſon, till he made confeſſion of the crime, of which he was ſuſpected. By ſuch a mode of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the innocent were certain of ſuffering longer than the guilty; for, as they had nothing to confeſs, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor, miſtaken innocence for obſtinacy, perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his inflictions, and it frequently happened that he compelled the innocent to become criminal, and aſſert a falſehood, that they might be releaſed from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, which they could no longer ſuſtain. Vivaldi conſidered this circumſtance undauntedly; every fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of his ſoul was bent up to firmneſs and endurance. He believed that he underſtood the extent of the charge, which would be brought againſt him, a charge as falſe, as a ſpecious confirmation of it, would be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible in its conſequence both to Ellena and himſelf. Yet every art would be practiſed to bring him to an acknowledgement of having carried off a nun, and he knew alſo, that, ſince the proſecutor and the witneſſes are never confronted with the priſoner in caſes of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere accuſation, and ſince their very names are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from him, it would be ſcarcely poſſible for him, to prove his innocence. But he did not heſitate an inſtant whether to ſacrifice himſelf for Ellena, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining rather to expire beneath the mercileſs inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Inquiſitors, than to aſſert a flaſehood, which muſt involve her in deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>The officer, at length, appeared, and, having beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Vivaldi to advance, uncovered his head, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his arms. He then led him forward through the
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:032735_0283_0FF494B5EC31C438"/>
folding door into the chamber; having done which, he immediately withdrew, and the door, which ſhut out Hope, cloſed after him.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi found himſelf in a ſpacious apartment, where only two perſons were viſible, who were ſeated at a large table, that occupied the centre of the room. They were both habited in black; the one, who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his piercing eye, and extraordinary phyſiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to be an Inquiſitor, wore on his head a kind of black turban, which heightened the natural ferocity of his viſage; the other was uncovered, and his arms bared to the elbows. A book, with ſome inſtruments of ſingular appearance lay before him. Round the table were ſeveral unoccupied chairs, on the backs of which appeared figurative ſigns, at the upper end of the apartment, a gigantic crucifix ſtretched nearly to the vaulted roof; and, at the lower end, ſuſpended from an arch in the wall, was a dark curtain, but whether it veiled a window, or ſhrowded ſome object or perſon, neceſſary to the deſigns of the Inquiſitor, there were little means of judging. It was, however, ſuſpended from an arch ſuch as ſometimes contains a caſement, or leads to a deep receſs.</p>
                     <p>The Inquiſitor called on Vivaldi to advance, and when he had reached the table, put a book into his hands, and bade him ſwear to reveal the truth, and keep for ever ſecret whatever he might ſee or hear in the apartment.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi heſitated to obey ſo unqualified a command. The Inquiſitor reminded him, by a look, not to be miſtaken, that he was abſolute here; but Vivaldi ſtill heſitated. "Shall I conſent to my own condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?" ſaid he to himſelf, "The malice of demons like theſe may convert the moſt innocent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances into matter of accuſation, for my deſtruction, and I muſt anſwer whatever queſtions they chooſe to aſk. And ſhall I ſwear, alſo, to conceal whatever I
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:032735_0284_0FF495B43106DB88"/>
may witneſs in this chamber, when I know that the moſt diabolical cruelties are hourly practiſed here?"</p>
                     <p>The Inquiſitor, in a voice which would have made a heart, leſs fortified than was Vivaldi's tremble, again commanded him to ſwear; at the ſame time, he made a ſignal to the perſon, who ſat at the oppoſite end of table, and who appeared to be an inferior officer.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi was ſtill ſilent, but he began to conſider that, unconſcious as he was of crime, it was ſcarcely poſſible for his words to be tortured into ſelf-accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that, whatever he might witneſs, no retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be prevented, no evil withheld by the oath, which bound him to ſecreſy, ſince his moſt ſevere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation could avail nothing againſt the ſupreme power of the tribunal. As he did not perceive any good, which could ariſe from refuſing the oath; and ſaw much immediate evil from reſiſtance, he conſented to receive it. Notwithſtanding this, when he put the book to his lips, and uttered the tremendous vow preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, heſitation and reluctance returned upon his mind, and an icy coldneſs ſtruck to his heart. He was ſo much affected, that circumſtances, apparently the moſt trivial, had at this moment influence upon his imagination. As he accidentally threw his eyes upon the curtain, which he had obſerved before with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out emotion, and now thought it moved, he almoſt ſtarted in expectation of ſeeing ſome perſon, an Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor perhaps, as terrific as the one before him, or an accuſer as malicious as Schedoni, ſteal from behind it</p>
                     <p>The Inquiſitor having adminiſtered the oath, and the attendant having noted it in his book, the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation began. After demanding, as is uſual, the names and titles of Vivaldi and his family, and his place of reſidence, to which he fully replied, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor aſked, whether he underſtood the nature of the accuſation on which he had been arreſted.</p>
                     <p>"The order for my arreſtation informed me," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="287" facs="unknown:032735_0285_0FF4960102365860"/>
"Look to your words!" ſaid the Inquiſitor, "and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your oath. What was the ground of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation?"</p>
                     <p>"I underſtood," ſaid Vivaldi, "that I was accuſed of having ſtolen a nun from her ſanctuary."</p>
                     <p>A faint degree of ſurprize appeared on the brow of the Inquiſitor. "You confeſs it, then?" he ſaid, after a pauſe of a moment, and making a ſignal to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, who immediately noted Vivaldi's words.</p>
                     <p>"I ſolemnly deny it," replied Vivaldi: "the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is falſe and malicious."</p>
                     <p>"Remember the oath you have taken! repeated the Inquiſitor: learn, alſo, that mercy is ſhewn to ſuch as make full confeſſion; but that the torture is applied to thoſe, who have the folly and obſtinacy to withhold the truth."</p>
                     <p>"If you torture me till I acknowledge the juſtneſs of this accuſation," ſaid Vivaldi, "I muſt expire under your inflictions, for ſuffering never ſhall compel me to aſſert a falſhood. It is not the truth, which you ſeek; it is not the guilty whom you puniſh; the innocent, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no crimes to confeſs, are the victims of your cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, or, to eſcape from it, become criminal, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a lie."</p>
                     <p>"Recollect yourſelf," ſaid the Inquiſitor, ſternly. "You are not brought hither to accuſe, but to anſwer accuſation. You ſay you are innocent; yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge yourſelf to be acquainted with the ſubject of the charge which is to be urged againſt you! How could you know this, but from the voice of conſcience?"</p>
                     <p>"From the words of your own ſummons," replied Vivaldi, "and from thoſe of your officials who arreſted me."</p>
                     <p>"How!" exclaimed the Inquiſitor: "note that," pointing to the Secretary, "he ſays by the words of our ſummous; now we know, that you never read that ſummons. He ſays alſo by the words of our officials; it appears, then, he is ignorant, that death would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuch a breach of confidence."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="288" facs="unknown:032735_0286_0FF495B74432AD30"/>
"It is true, I never did read the ſummons," replied Vivaldi, "and as true, that I never a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>"No more of this equivocation!" ſaid the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor, "Speak only to the queſtion."</p>
                     <p>"I will not ſuffer my aſſertions to be miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed," replied Vivaldi, "or my words to be perverted againſt myſelf. I have ſworn to ſpeak the truth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſince you believe I violate my oath, and doubt my direct and ſimple words, I will ſpeak no more,"</p>
                     <p>The Inquiſitor half roſe from his chair, and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance grew paler. "Audacious heretic!" he ſaid, "will you diſpute, inſult, and diſobey, the commands of our moſt holy tribunal! You will be taught the conſequence of your deſperate impiety To the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with him!"</p>
                     <p>A ſtern ſmile was on the features of Vivaldi; his eyes were calmly fixed on the Inquiſitor, and his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude was undaunted and firm. His courage, and the cool contempt, which his looks expreſſed, ſeemed to touch his examiner, who perceived that he had not a common mind to operate upon. He abandoned, therefore, for the preſent, terrific meaſures, and, reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his uſual manner proceeded in the examination.</p>
                     <p>"Where were you arreſted?"</p>
                     <p>"At the chapel of San Sebaſtian on the lake of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lano."</p>
                     <p>You are certain as to this?" aſked the Inquiſitor, "you are ſure it was not at the village of Legano, on the high road betwen Celano and Rome?"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi while he confirmed his aſſertion, recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with ſome ſurprize, that Legano was the place where the guard had been changed, and he mentioned the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance. The Inquiſitor, however, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> in his queſtions, without appearing to notice it. "Was any perſon arreſted with you?"</p>

"You cannot be ignorant," replied Vivaldi, "that Signora di Roſalba, was ſeized at the ſame time, upon the falſe charge of being a nun, who had broken her vows, and eloped from her convent; nor that Paulo Mendrico, my faithful ſervant! was alſo made a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, though upon what pretence he was arreſted I am utterly ignorant."</p>
                     <p>The Inquiſitor remained for ſome moments in thoughtful ſilence, and then enquired ſlightly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the family of Ellena, and her uſual place of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Vivaldi, fearful of making ſome aſſertion that might be prejudicial to her, referred him to herſelf; but the inquiry was repeated.</p>
                     <p>"She is now within theſe walls," replied Vivaldi, hoping to learn from the manner of his examiner whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his fears were juſt," and can anſwer theſe queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions better than myſelf."</p>
                     <p>The Inquiſitor merely bade the notary write down her name, and then remained for a few moments me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating. At length, he ſaid, "Do you know where you now are?"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, ſmiling at the queſtion, replied, "I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that I am in the priſons of the Inquiſition at Rome."</p>
                     <p>"Do you know what are the crimes that ſubject perſons to the cognizance of the Holy Office?"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi was ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"Your conſcience informs <hi>you,</hi> and your ſilence confirms <hi>me.</hi> Let me admoniſh you, once more, to make a full confeſſion of your guilt; remember that this is a merciful tribunal, and ſhews favour to ſuch as acknowledge their crimes?"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi ſmiled; but the Inquiſitor proceeded.</p>
                     <p>"It does not reſemble ſome ſevere, yet juſt courts, where immediate execution follows the confeſſion of a criminal. No! it is merciful, and though it puniſhes guilt, it never applies the torture but in caſes of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,

                     <p>"But if the priſoner has nothing to confeſs?" ſaid Vivaldi.—"Can your tortures make him guilty? They may force a weak mind to be guilty of falſehood; to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>Vivaldi made no reply, and the Inquiſitor, after a momentary ſilence, added, "Was you ever in the church of the Spirito Santo, at Naples!"</p>

                     <p>The names of the Witneſſes?" demanded Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di.
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:032735_0289_0FF4960DA5A2C7E8"/>
"The ſame juſtice conceals them alſo from the knowledge of the accuſed," replied the Inquiſitor.</p>
                     <p>"And is no juſtice left for the Accuſed," ſaid Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, "Is he to be tried and condemned without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confronted with either his Proſecutor or the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes!"</p>
                     <p>"Your queſtions are too many," ſaid the Inquiſitor, "and your anſwers too few. The Informer is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Proſecutor; the Holy Office before which the information is laid, is the Proſecutor, and the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of juſtice; its Public Accuſer lays the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and the teſtimonies of the Witneſſes, before the Court. But too much of this."</p>
                     <p>"How!" exclaimed Vivaldi, "is the tribunal at once the Proſecutor, Witneſs and Judge! What can private malice wiſh for more, than ſuch a court of <hi>juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,</hi> at which to arraign its enemy? The ſtiletto of the Aſſaſſin is not ſo ſure, or ſo fatal to innocence. I now perceive, that it avails me nothing to be guiltleſs; a ſingle enemy is ſufficient to accompliſh my deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
                     <p>"You have an enemy then?" obſerved the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi was too well convinced that he had one, but there was not ſufficient proof, as to the perſon of this enemy, to juſtify him in aſſerting that it was Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni. The circumſtance of Ellena having been ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, would have compelled him to ſuſpect another perſon as being at leaſt acceſſary to the deſigns of the Confeſſor; had not credulity ſtarted in horror from the ſuppoſition, that a mother's reſentment could poſſibly betray her ſon into the priſons of the Inquiſition, though this mother had exhibited a temper of remorſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs cruelty towards a ſtranger, who had interrupted her views for that ſon.</p>
                     <p>"You have an enemy then?" repeated the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor.</p>

                        </gap> ſufficiently proves it," replied Vivaldi. "But I am ſo little any man's enemy, that I know not who to call mine."</p>
                     <p>"It is evident, then, that you have no enemy," ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ſubtle Inquiſitor, "and that this accuſation is brought againſt you by a reſpecter of truth, and a faithful ſervant of the Roman intereſt."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi was ſhocked to perceive the inſidious art, by which he had been betrayed into a declaration ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently ſo harmleſs, and the cruel dexterity with which it had been turned againſt him. A lofty and contemptuous ſilence was all that he oppoſed to the treachery of his examiner, on whoſe countenance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a ſmile of triumph and ſelf congratulation, the life of a fellow-creature being, in his eſtimation, of no comparative importance with the ſelf-applauſes of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful art; the art, too, upon which he moſt valued himſelf—that of his profeſſion.</p>
                     <p>The Inquiſitor proceeded, "You perſiſt, then, in withholding the truth?" He pauſed, but Vivaldi mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no reply, he reſumed.</p>
                     <p>"Since it is evident, from your own declaration, that you have no enemy, whom private reſentment might have inſtigated to accuſe you; and, from other circumſtances which have occured in your conduct, that you are conſcious of more than you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed—it appears, that the accuſation which has been urged againſt you, is not a malicious ſlander. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you, therefore, and once more conjure you, by our how faith, to make an ingenuous confeſſion of your offences, and to ſave yourſelf from the means, which muſt of neceſſity be enforced to obtain a confeſſion before your trial commences. I adjure you, alſo, to conſider, that by ſuch open conduct only, can mercy b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Vivaldi, perceiving that it was now neceſſary for
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:032735_0291_0FF4960F2CCEEE98"/>
him to reply, once more ſolemnly aſſerted his innocence of the crime alleged againſt him in the ſummons, and of the conſciouſneſs of any act, which might lawfully ſubject him to the notice of the Holy Office.</p>
                     <p>The inquiſitor again demanded what was the crime alledged, and, Vivaldi having repeated the accuſation, he again bade the Secretary note it; as he did which, Vivaldi thought he perceived upon his features ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a malignant ſatisfaction, for which he knew not how to account. When the Secretary had finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Vivaldi was ordered to ſubſcribe his name and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to the depoſitions, and he obeyed.</p>
                     <p>The Inquiſitor then bade him conſider of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition he had received, and prepare either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs on the morrow, or to undergo the queſtion. As he concluded, he gave a ſignal, and the officer, who had conducted Vivaldi into the chamber, immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
                     <p>"You know your orders, ſaid the Inquiſitor, "re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your priſoner, and ſee that they are obeyed."</p>
                     <p>The official bowed, and Vivaldi followed him from the apartment in melancholy ſilence.</p>

                     <p>ELLENA, meanwhile, when ſhe had been carried from the chapel of San Sebaſtian, was placed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a horſe in waiting, and, guarded by the two men who had ſeized her, commenced a journey, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with little interruption during two nights and days. She had no means of judging whither ſhe was going, and liſtened in vain expectation, for the feet of horſes, and the voice of Vivaldi, who, ſhe had been told was following on the ſame road.</p>
                     <p>The ſteps of travellers ſeldom broke upon the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of theſe regions, and during the journey, ſhe was met only by ſome market people paſſing to a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing town, or now and then by the vine-dreſſers or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in the olive grounds; and ſhe deſcended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the vaſt plains of Apulia, ſtill ignorant of her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation. An encampment, not of warriors, but of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032735_0294_0FF496508DB239C0"/>
ſhepherds, who were leading their flocks to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Abruzzo, enlivened a ſmall tract of theſe lev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, which were ſhadowed on the north and eaſt by the mountainous ridge of the Garganus, ſtreching from the Apennine far into the Adriatic.</p>
                     <p>The appearance of the ſhepherds was nearly as wild and ſavage as that of the men, who conducted Ellena; but their paſtoral inſtruments of flageolets and tabors ſpoke of more civilized feelings, as they ſounded ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over the deſert. Her guards reſted, and refreſhed themſelves with goats milk, barly cakes, and almonds, and the manners of theſe ſhepherds, like thoſe ſhe had formerly met with on the mountains, proved to be more hoſpitable than their air had indicated.</p>
                     <p>After Ellena had quitted this paſtoral camp, no veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a human reſidence appeared for ſeveral leagues, except here and there the towers of a decayed fortreſs, perched upon the lofty acclivities ſhe was approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and half concealed in the woods. The evening of the ſecond day was drawing on, when her guards drew near the foreſt, which ſhe had long obſerved in the diſtance, ſpreading over the many-riſing ſteeps of the Garganus, They entered by a track, a road it could not be called, which led among oaks and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantic cheſnuts, apparently the growth of centuries, and ſo thickly interwoven, that their branches formed a canopy which ſeldom admitted the ſky. The gloom which they threw around, and the thickets of cyſtus, juniper, and lenticus, which flouriſhed beneath the ſhade, gave a character of fearful wildneſs to the ſcene.</p>
                     <p>Having reached an eminence, where the trees were more thinkly ſcattered, Ellena perceived the foreſts ſpreading on all ſides among hills and vallies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending towards the Adriatic, which bounded the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in front. The coaſt, bending into a bay, was rocky and bold. Lofty pinacles, wooded to their ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, roſe over the ſhores, and cliffs of naked marble
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032735_0295_0FF46ECC051135F0"/>
of ſuch gigantic proportions, that they were awful even at a diſtance, obtruded themſelves far into the waves, breaſting their eternal fury. Beyond the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of the coaſt, as far as the eye could reach, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pointed mountains, darkened with forreſts, riſing ridge over ridge, in many ſucceſſions. Ellena, as ſhe ſurveyed this wild ſcenery, felt as if ſhe was going into eternal baniſhment from ſociety. She was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil, but it was with the quietneſs of exhauſted grief, not of reſignation; and ſhe looked back upon the paſt, and awaited the future, with a kind of out breathed deſpair.</p>
                     <p>She had travelled for ſome miles through the foreſt, her guards only now and then uttering to each other a queſtion, or an obſervation concerning the changes which had taken place in the bordering ſcenery, ſince they laſt paſt it, when night began to cloſe in upon them</p>
                     <p>Ellena perceived her approach to the ſea, only by the murmurs of its ſurge upon the rocky coaſt, till having reached an eminence, which was, however, no more than the baſe of two woody mountaims that towered cloſely over it, ſhe ſaw dimly its grey ſurface ſpreading in the bay below. She now ventured to aſk how much farther ſhe had to go, and whether ſhe was to be taken on board one of the little veſſels, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently fiſhing ſmacks, that ſhe could juſt diſcern at anchor.</p>
                     <p>"You have not far to go now," replied one of the guards, furlily; "you will ſoon be at the end of your journey, and at reſt."</p>
                     <p>They deſcended to the ſhore, and preſently came to a lonely dwelling, which ſtood ſo near the margin of the ſea, as almoſt to be waſhed by the waves. No light appeared at any of the lattices; and, from the ſilence that reigned within, it ſeemed to be uninhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The guard had probably reaſon to know other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032735_0296_0FF4965B4C41AA30"/>
for they halted at the door, and ſhouted with all their ſtrength. No voice, however, anſwered to their call, and, while they perſevered in efforts to rouſe the inhabitants, Ellena anxiouſly examined the building, as exactly as the twilight would permit. It was of an ancient and peculiar ſtructure, and though ſcarcely important enough for a manſion, had evidently never been deſigned for the reſidence of peaſants.</p>
                     <p>The walls of unhewn marble, were high, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by baſtions; and the edifice had turreted corners, which, with the porch in front, and the ſloping roof, were falling faſt into numerous ſymtoms of decay. The whole building, with its dark windows and ſoundleſs avenues, had an air ſtrikingly forlorn and ſolitary. A high wall ſurrounded the ſmall court in which it ſtood, and probably had once ſerved as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the dwelling; but the gates, which ſhould have cloſed againſt intruders, could no longer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their office; one of the folds had dropped from its faſtenings, and lay on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he ground almoſt conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a deep bed of weeds, and the other creaked on its hinges to every blaſt, at each ſwing ſeeming ready to follow the fate of its companion.</p>
                     <p>The repeated calls of the guard were at length an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by a rough voice from within; when the door of the porch was lazily unbarred, and opened by a man, whoſe viſage was ſo miſery-ſtruck, that Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na could not look upon it with indifference, though wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pt in miſery of her own. The lamp he held threw a gleam athwart it, and ſhewed the gaunt ferocity of famine, to which the ſhadow of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> eyes added a terrific wildneſs. Ellena ſhrunk while ſhe gazed. She had never before ſeen villainy and ſuffering ſo ſtrongly pictured on the ſame face, and ſhe obſerved him with a degree of thrilling curioſity, which for a moment excluded from her mind all conſciouſneſs of the evils to be apprehended from him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="7" facs="unknown:032735_0297_0FF46ED102B46DB8"/>
It was evident that this houſe had not been built for his reception; and ſhe conjectured that he was he ſervant of ſome cruel agent of the Marcheſa di Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi.</p>
                     <p>From the porch ſhe followed into an old hall, ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deſtitute of any kind of furniture. It was not extenſive but lofty, for it ſeemed to aſcend to the roof of the edifice, and the chambers above opened around it into a corridor.</p>
                     <p>Some half-ſullen ſalutations were exchanged between the guard and the ſtranger, whom they called Spalatro, as they paſſed into a chamber, where it appeared that he had been ſleeping on a mattreſs laid in a corner. All the other furniture of the place were two or three broken chairs and a table. He eyed Ellena with a ſhrewd contracted brow, and then looked ſignificant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the guard, but was ſilent, till he deſired them all to ſit down, adding, that he would dreſs ſome fiſh for ſupper. Ellena diſcovered that this man was the maſter of the place; it appeared alſo that he was the only inhabitant; and, when the guard ſoon after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her their journey conluded here, her worſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions were confirmed. The efforts ſhe made to ſuſtain her ſpirits, were no longer ſucceſsful. It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſhe was brought hither by ruffians to a lonely houſe on the ſea-ſhore inhabited by a man, who had "villain" engraved in every line of his face, to be the victim of enexorable pride and an inſatiable deſire of revenge. After conſidering theſe circumſtances, and the words, which had juſt told her ſhe was to go no further, conviction ſtruck like lightning upon her heart; and, believing ſhe was brought hither to be aſſaſſinated, horror chilled all her frame, and her ſenſes forſook her.</p>
                     <p>On recovering, ſhe found herſelf ſurrounded by the guard and the ſtranger, and ſhe would have ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their pity, but that ſhe feared to exaſperate
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032735_0298_0FF4965CD4CA9DD8"/>
them by betraying her ſuſpicions. She complained of fatigue, and requeſted to be ſhewn to her room. The men looked upon one another, heſitated, and then aſked her to partake of the fiſh that was preparing. But Ellena having declined the invitation with as good a grace as ſhe could aſſume, they conſented that ſhe ſhould withdraw. Spalatro, taking the lamp, lighted her acroſs the hall, to the corrodor above, where he opened the door of a chamber, in which he ſaid ſhe was to ſleep.</p>
                     <p>"Where is my bed?" ſaid the afflicted Ellena, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as ſhe looked round.</p>
                     <p>"It is there—on the floor," replied Spalatro, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a miſerable mattreſs, over which hung the tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered curtain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of what had once been a canopy. "If you want the lamp," he added, "I will leave it, and come for it in a minute or two."</p>
                     <p>"Will you not let me have a lamp for the night?" ſhe ſaid in a ſupplicating and timid voice.</p>
                     <p>"For the night!" ſaid the man gruffly; "What! to ſet fire to the houſe."</p>
                     <p>Ellena ſtill entreated that he would allow her the comfort of a light.</p>
                     <p>"Aye, aye." replied Spalatro, with a look ſhe could not comprehend, "it would be a great comfort to you, truly! You do not know what you aſk."</p>
                     <p>"What is it that you mean?" ſaid Ellena, eagerly; "I conjure you, in the name of our holy church, to tell me!"</p>
                     <p>Spalatro ſtepped ſuddenly back, and looked upon her with ſurpriſe, but without ſpeaking.</p>
                     <p>"Have mercy on me!" ſaid Ellena, greatly alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his manner; "I am friendleſs, and without help!"</p>
                     <p>"What do you fear," ſaid the man, recovering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and then, without waiting her reply, added—
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032735_0299_0FF46ED3DF18F3E8"/>
"Is it ſuch and an unmerciful deed to take away a lamp?"</p>
                     <p>Ellena, who again feared to betray the extent of her ſuſpicions, only replied, that it would be merciful to leave it, for that her ſpirits were low, and ſhe required light to cheer them in a new abode.</p>
                     <p>"We do not ſtand upon ſuch conceits here," repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spalatro, "we have other matters to mind. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. it's the only lamp in the houſe, and the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny below are in darkneſs while I am loſing time here. I will leave it for two minutes, and no more." El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena made a ſign for him to put down the lamp; and, when he left the room, ſhe heard the door barred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her.</p>
                     <p>She employed theſe two minutes in examining the chamber, and the poſſibility it might afford of an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape. It was a large apartment, unfurniſhed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwept of the cobwebs of many years. The only door ſhe diſcovered was the one, by which ſhe had entered, and the only window a lattice, which was grated. Such preparation for preventing eſcape ſeemed to hint how much there might be to eſcape from.</p>
                     <p>Having examined the chamber, without finding a ſingle circumſtance to encourage hope, tried the ſtrength of the bars, which ſhe could not ſhake, and ſought in vain for an inſide faſtening to her door, ſhe placed the lamp beſide it, and awaited the return of Spalatro. In a few moments he came and offered her a cup of ſour wine with a ſlice of bread; which, being ſomewhat ſoothed by this attention, ſhe did not think proper to reject.</p>
                     <p>Spalatro then quitted the room, and the door was again barred. Left once more alone, ſhe tried to overcome apprehenſion by prayer; and after offering up her veſpers with a fervent heart, ſhe became more confiding and compoſed.</p>
                     <p>But it was impoſſible that ſhe could ſo far forget the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032735_0300_0FF4965E5D02B260"/>
dangers of her ſituation as to ſeek ſleep, however wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſhe might be, while the door of her room remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unſecured againſt the intruſion of the ruffians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and, as ſhe had no means of faſtening it, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to watch during the whole night. Thus left to ſolitude and darkneſs, ſhe ſeated herſelf upon the mattreſs to await the return of morning, and was ſoon loſt in ſad reflection; every minute occurrence of the paſt day, and of the conduct of her guards, moved in review before her judgment: and, combin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe with the circumſtances of her preſent ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, ſcarcely a doubt as to the fate deſigned for her remained. It ſeemed highly improbable that the Marcheſa di Vivaldi had ſent her hither merely for impriſonment, ſince ſhe might have confined her in a convent with much leſs trouble; and ſtill more ſo when Ellena conſidered the character of the Marcheſa, ſuch as ſhe had already experienced it. The appearance of this houſe, and of the man who inhabited it, with the circumſtance of no woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found reſiding here, each and all of theſe ſignified, that ſhe was brought hither not for long impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but for death. Her utmoſt efforts for forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or reſignation could not overcome the cold trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings, the ſickneſs of heart, the faintneſs and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal horror that aſſailed her. How often, with tears of mingled terror and grief, did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he call upon Vivaldi—Vivaldi, alas! far diſtant—to ſave her; how often exclaim in agony, that ſhe ſhould never, never ſee him more!</p>
                     <p>She was ſpared, however, the horror of believing that he was an inhabitant of the inquiſition, Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing detected the impoſition which had been practiſed towards herſelf, and that ſhe was neither on the way to the Holy Office, nor conducted by perſons belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, ſhe concluded, that the whole affair of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi's arreſt, had been planned by the Marcheſa, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032735_0301_0FF46EE56B8FD718"/>
as a pretence for confining him till ſhe ſhould be placed beyond the reach of his aſſiſtance. She hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, therefore, that he had only been ſent to ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate reſidence belonging to his family, and that, when her fate was decided, he would be releaſed, and ſhe be the only victim. This was the ſole conſideration that afforded any degree of aſſuagement to her ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.—</p>
                     <p>The people below ſat till a late hour. She liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed often to their diſtant voices, as they were diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable in the pauſes of the ſurge, that broke loud and hollow on the ſhore; and every time the creak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hinges of their room door moved, apprehended they were coming to her. At length it appeared they had left the apartment, or had fallen aſleep there, for a profound ſtillneſs reigned whenever the murmur of the waves ſunk. Doubt did not long deceive her, for, while ſhe yet liſtened, ſhe diſtinguiſhed footſteps aſcending to the corridor. She heard them approach her chamber, and ſtop at the door; ſhe heard, alſo, the low whiſpering of their voices, as they ſeemed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting on what was to be done, and ſhe ſcarcely ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to draw breath, while ſhe intenſely attended to them. Not a word, however, diſtinctly reached her, till, as one of them was departing, another called out in a half whiſper, "It is below on the table, in my girdle; make haſte." The man came back, and ſaid ſomething in a lower voice, to which the other replied, "ſhe ſleeps," or Ellena was deceived by the hiſſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants of ſome other words. He then deſcended the ſtairs; and its a few minutes ſhe perceived his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade alſo paſs away from the door; ſhe liſtened to his retreating ſteps, till the roaring of the ſea was alone heard in their ſtead.</p>
                     <p>Ellena's terrors were relieved only for a moment Conſidering the import of the words, it appeared that he man who had deſcended, was gone for the ſtiletto
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032735_0302_0FF4965FE52892C0"/>
of the other, ſuch an inſtrument being uſually worn in the girdle, and from the aſſurance, "ſhe ſleeps," he ſeemed to fear that his words had been overheard; and ſhe liſtened again for their ſteps; but they came no more.</p>
                     <p>Happily for Ellena,s peace, ſhe knew not that her chamber had a door, ſo contrived as to open without ſound, by which aſſaſſins might enter unſuſpectedly at any hour of the night. Believing that the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this houſe had now retired to reſt, her hopes and her ſpirits began to revive; but ſhe was yet ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and watchful. She meaſured the chamber with unequal ſteps, often ſtarting as the old boards ſhook and groaned where ſhe paſſed; and often pauſing to liſten whether all was yet ſtill in the corridor. The gleam which a riſing moon threw between the bars of her window, now began to ſhew many ſhadowy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the chamber, which ſhe did not recollect to have obſerved while the lamp was there. More than once, ſhe fancied ſhe ſaw ſomething glide along towards the place where the mattreſs was laid, and, almoſt congealed with terror, ſhe ſtood ſtill to watch it; but the illuſion, if ſuch it was, diſappeared where the moon-light faded, and even her fears could not give ſhape to it beyond. Had ſhe not known that her chamber door remained ſtrongly barred, ſhe would have believed this was an aſſaſſin ſtealing to the bed where it might be ſuppoſed ſhe ſlept. Even now the thought occurred to her, and, vague as it was, had power to ſtrike an anguiſh, almoſt deadly, through her heart, while ſhe conſidered that her immediate ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was nearly as perilous as the one ſhe had imaged.</p>
                     <p>Again ſhe liſtened, and ſcarcely dared to breathe; but not the ligheſt ſound occurred in the pauſes of the waves, and ſhe believed herſelf convinced that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon except herſelf was in the room, That ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in this belief, appeared from her unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032735_0303_0FF46EE942BCBAB8"/>
to approach the mattreſs, while it was yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in ſhade. Unable to overcome her reluctance, ſhe took her ſtation at the window, till the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening rays ſhould allow a clearer view of the chamber, and in ſome degree reſtore her confidence; and ſhe watched the ſcene without as it gradually became vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. The moon, riſing over the ocean, ſhewed its reſtleſs ſurface ſpreading to the wide horizon; and the waves, which broke in foam upon the rocky beach below, retiring in long white lines far upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. She liſtened to their meaſured and ſolemn ſound, and, ſomewhat ſoothed by the ſolitary grandeur of the view, remained at the lattice till the moon had riſen high into the heavens; and even till morning began to dawn upon the ſea, and purple the eaſtern clouds.</p>
                     <p>Re-aſſured by the light that now prevaded her room, ſhe returned to the mattreſs; where anxiety at length yielded to her wearineſs, and ſhe obtained a ſhort repoſe.</p>

                     <p>ELLENA was awakened from profound ſleep, by a loud noiſe at the door of her chamber; when ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from her mattreſs, ſhe looked around her with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and diſmay, as imperfect recollections of the paſt began to gather on her mind. She diſtinguiſhed the undrawing of iron bars, and the countenance of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latro at her door, before ſhe had a clear remembrance of her ſituation—that ſhe was a priſoner in a houſe on a lonely ſhore, and that this man was her jailor. Such ſickneſs of the heart returned with theſe convictions, ſuch faintneſs and terror, that unable to ſupport her trembling frame, ſhe ſunk again upon the mattreſs, without demanding the reaſon of this abrupt intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.—</p>
                     <p>"I have brought you ſome breakfaſt," ſaid Spala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro, "if you are awake to take it; but you ſeem to be aſleep yet. Surely you have had ſleep ſufficient for one night; you went to reſt ſoon enough."</p>
                     <p>Ellena made no reply, but, deeply affected with a ſenſe of her ſituation, looked with beſeeching eyes at the man, who advanced, holding forth an oaten cake and baſon of milk. "Where ſhall I ſet them?" ſaid he," you muſt need be glad of them, ſince you had no ſupper."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="15" facs="unknown:032735_0305_0FF46EEAE3553A20"/>
Ellena thanked him, and deſired he would place them on the floor, for there was neither table nor chair in the room. As he did this, ſhe was ſtruck with the expreſſion of his countenance, which exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited a ſtrange mixture of archneſs and malignity.—He ſeemed congratulating himſelf upon his ingenuity, and anticipating ſome occaſion of triumph; and ſhe was ſo much intereſted, that her obſervation never quitted him while he remained in the room. As his eyes accidentally met her's, he turned them away, with the abruptneſs of a perſon who is conſcious of evil intentions, and fears leſt they ſhould be detected; nor once looked up till he haſtily left the chamber, when ſhe heard the door ſecured as formerly.</p>
                     <p>The impreſſion, his look had left on her mind, ſo wholly engaged her in conjecture, that a conſiderable time elapſed before ſhe remembered that he had brought the refreſhment ſhe ſo much required; but, as ſhe now lifted it to her lips, a horrible ſuſpicion ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted her hand; it was not however, before ſhe had ſwallowed a ſmall quantity of the milk. The look of Spalatro, which occaſioned her ſurpriſe, had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the ſetting down of the breakfaſt, and it occured to her, that poiſon was infuſed in this liquid. She was thus compelled to refuſe the ſuſtenance, which was become neceſſary to her, for ſhe feared to taſte even of the oaten cake, ſince Spalatro had offered it, but the little milk ſhe had unwarily taken, was ſo very ſmall that ſhe had no apprehenſion concerning it.</p>
                     <p>The day, however, paſſed in terror, and almoſt in deſpondency; ſhe could neither doubt the purpoſe, for which ſhe had been brought hither, nor diſcover any poſſibility of eſcaping from her perſecutors; yet that propenſity to hope, which buoys up the human heart, even in the ſevereſt hours of trial, ſuſtained, in ſome degree, her fainting ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>During theſe miſerable hours of ſolitude, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032735_0306_0FF4966AD30C4050"/>
the only alleviation to her ſuffering aroſe from a belief, that Vivaldi was ſafe, at leaſt from danger, though not from grief; but ſhe now underſtood too much of the dexterous contrivances of the Marche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, his mother, to think it was practicable for him to eſcape from her deſigns, and again reſtore her to liberty.</p>
                     <p>All day Ellena either leaned againſt the bars of her window, loſt in reverie, while her unconſcious eyes were fixed upon the ocean, whoſe murmurs ſhe no longer heard; or ſhe liſtened for ſome ſound from within the houſe, that might aſſiſt her conjectures, as to the number of perſons below, or what might be paſſing there. The houſe, however, was profoundly ſtill, except where now and then a footſtep ſaunter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along a diſtant paſſage, or a door was heard to cloſe; but not the hum of a ſingle voice aroſe from the lower room, nor any ſymptom of there being more than one perſon, beſide herſelf, in the dwelling. Though ſhe had not heard her former guards depart, it appeared certain that they were gone, and that ſhe was left alone in this place with Spalatro. What could be the purport of ſuch a proceeding, Ellena could not i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine; if her death was deſigned, it ſeemed ſtrange that one perſon only ſhould be left to the hazard of the deed, when three muſt have rendered the completion of it certain. But this ſurprize vaniſhed, when her ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of poiſon returned; for it was probable, that theſe men had believed their ſcheme to be already near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompliſhed, and had abandoned her to die alone, in a chamber from whence eſcape was impracticable, leaving Spalatro to diſpoſe of her remains. All the incongruities ſhe had ſeparately obſerved in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſeemed now to harmonize and unite in one plan; and her death, deſigned by poiſon, and that poiſon to be conveyed in the diſguiſe of nouriſhment, appeared to have been the object of it, Whether it was that the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032735_0307_0FF49610B4113D28"/>
ſtrength of this conviction affected her fancy, or the cauſe was real, Ellena, remembering at this moment that ſhe had taſted the milk, was ſiezed with an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſhuddering, and thought ſhe felt that the poiſon had been ſufficiently potent to affect her, even in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable quantity ſhe might have taken.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe was thus agitated, ſhe diſtinguiſhed foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps loitering near the door, and attentively liſtening, became convinced, that ſome perſon was in the corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. The ſteps moved ſoftly, ſometimes ſtopping for an inſtant, as if to allow time for liſtening, and ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſſed away.</p>
                     <p>"It is Spalatro!" ſaid Ellena; "he believes that I have taken the poiſon, and he comes to liſten for my dying groans! Alas! he is only come ſomewhat too ſoon, perhaps!"</p>
                     <p>As this horrible ſupoſition occurred, the ſhuddering returned with encreaſed violence, and ſhe ſunk almoſt fainting, on the mattreſs; but the fit was not of long continuance. When it gradually left her, and recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion revived, ſhe perceived, however, the prudence of ſuffering Spalatro to ſuppoſe ſhe had taken the beverage he brought her, ſince ſuch belief would at leaſt procure ſome delay of further ſchemes, and every delay afforded ſome poſſibility for hope to reſt upon. Ellena, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, poured through the bars of her window, the milk which ſhe believed Spalatro had deſigned ſhould be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in its conſequence.</p>
                     <p>It was evening, when ſhe again fancied footſteps were lingering near her door, and the ſuſpicion was confirmed, when, on turning her eyes, ſhe perceived a ſhade on the floor, underneath it, as of ſome perſon ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned without. Preſently the ſhadow glided away, and at the ſame time ſhe diſtinguiſhed departing ſteps treading cautiouſly.</p>
                     <p>"It is he!" ſaid Ellena; "he ſtill liſtens for my moans!"</p>
                     <p>

This further confirmation of his deſigns affected her nearly as much as the firſt; when anxiouſly turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her looks toward, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he corridor, the ſhadow again appeared beneath the door, but ſhe heard no ſtep. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena now watched it with intenſe ſolicitude and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: fearing every inſtant that Spalatro would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude her doubts by entering the room. "And O! when he diſcovers that I live," thought ſhe, "what may I not expect during the firſt moments of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment! what leſs than immediate death!"</p>
                     <p>The ſhadow, after remaining a few minutes ſtation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, moved a little, and then glided away as before. But it quickly returned, and a low ſound followed, as of ſome perſon endeavouring to unfaſten bolts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out noiſe. Ellena heard one bar gently undrawn, and then another; ſhe obſerved the door begin to move, and then to give way, till it gradually uncloſed, und the face of Spalatro preſented itſelf from behind it. Without immediately entering, he threw a glance round the chamber, as if he wiſhed to aſcertain ſome circumſtance before he ventured further. His look was more than uſually haggard as it reſted upon Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, who apparently repoſed on her mattreſs.</p>
                     <p>Having gazed at her for an inſtant, he ventured to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the bed with quick and unequal ſteps; his countenance expreſſed at once impatience, alarm, and the conſciouſneſs of guilt. When he was within a few paces, Ellena raiſed herſelf, and he ſtarted back as if a ſudden ſpectre had croſſed him. The more than uſual wildneſs and wanneſs of his looks, with the whole of his conduct, ſeemed to confirm all her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer terrors; and when he roughly aſked her how ſhe did, Ellena had not the ſufficient preſence of mind to anſwer that ſhe was ill. For ſome moments he regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her with an earneſt and ſullen attention, and then a ſly glance of ſcrutiny, which he threw round the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> her that he was inquiring whether ſhe
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032735_0309_0FF496123AC380B8"/>
had taken the poiſon. On perceiving that the baſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> was empty, he lifted it from the floor, and Ellena fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied a gleam of ſatisfaction paſſed over his viſage.</p>
                     <p>"You have had no dinner," ſaid he, "I forgot you; but ſupper will ſoon be ready; and you may walk up the beach till then, if you will,"</p>
                     <p>Ellena, extremly ſurpriſed and perplexed by this offer of a ſeeming indulgence, knew not whether to accept or reject it. She ſuſpected that ſome treachery lurked within it. The invitation appeared to be only a ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem to lure her to deſtruction, and ſhe determined to decline accepting it; when again ſhe conſidered, that to accompliſh this, it was not neceſſary to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw her from the chamber, where ſhe was already ſufficiently in the power of her perſecutors. Her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation could not be more deſperate than it was at preſent, and almoſt any change might make it leſs ſo.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe deſcended from the corridor, and paſſed through the lower part of the houſe, no perſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared but her conductor; and ſhe ventured to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether the men who had brought her hither were departed. Spalatro did not return an anſwer, but led the way in ſilence to the court, and, having paſſed the ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es, he pointed toward the weſt, and ſaid ſhe might walk that way.</p>
                     <p>Ellena bent her courſe towards the "many ſounding waves," followed at a ſhort diſtance by Spalatro, and, wrapt in thought, purſued the windings of the ſhore, ſcarcely noticing the objects around her, till, on paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the foot of a rock, ſhe lifted her eyes to the ſcene that unfolded beyond, and obſerved ſome huts ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a conſiderable diſtance, apparently the reſidence of fiſhermen. She could juſt diſtinguiſh the dark ſails of ſome ſkiffs turning the cliffs, and entering the little bay, where the hamlet margined the beach; but, though ſhe ſaw the ſails lowered, as the boats approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſhore, they were too far off to allow the figures
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032735_0310_0FF4966DE155EF80"/>
of the men to appear. To Ellena, who had believed that no human habitation, except her priſon, interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the vaſt ſolitudes of theſe foreſts and ſhores, the view of the huts, remote as they were, imparted a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hope, and even ſomewhat of joy. She looked back, to obſerve whether Spalatro was near: he was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy within a few paces; and, caſting a wiſtful glance forward to the remote cottages, her heart ſunk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                     <p>It was a lowering evening, and the ſea was dark and ſwelling; the ſcreams of the ſea birds too, as they wheeled among the clouds, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ought their high neſts in the rocks, ſeemed to indicate an approaching ſtorm. Ellena was not ſo wholly engaged by ſelfiſh ſufferings, but that ſhe could ſympathiſe with thoſe of others, and ſhe rejoiced that the fiſhermen, whoſe boats ſhe had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, had eſcaped the threatening tempeſt, and were ſafely ſheltered in their little homes, where as they heard the loud waves break along the coaſt, they could look with keener pleaſure upon the ſocial circle, and the warm comforts around them. From ſuch conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, however, ſhe returned again to a ſenſe of her own forlorn and friendleſs ſituation.</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" ſaid ſhe, "I have no longer a home, a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to ſmile welcomes upon me! I have no longer even one friend to ſupport, to reſcue me! I—a miſerable wanderer on a diſtant ſhore! tracked, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, by the footſteps of the aſſaſſin, who at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant eyes his victim with ſilent watchfulneſs, and awaits the moment of opportunity to ſacrifice her!"</p>
                     <p>Ellena ſhuddered as ſhe ſaid this, and turned again to obſerve whether Spalatro was near. He was not within view, and while ſhe wondered, and congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated herſelf on a poſſibility of eſcaping, ſhe perceived a Monk walking ſilently beneath the dark rocks that overbrowed the beach, His black garments were folded round him; his face was inclined toward the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032735_0311_0FF4961D787E72B8"/>
ground, and he had the air of a man in deep medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>"His, no doubt, are worthy muſings!" ſaid Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, as ſhe obſerved him, with mingled hope and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. "I may addreſs myſelf, without fear, to one-of his order. It is probably as much his wiſh, as it is his duty, to ſuccour the unfortunate. Who could have hoped to find on this ſequeſtered ſhore ſo ſacred a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector! his convent cannot be far off!"</p>
                     <p>He approached, his face ſtill bent towards the ground, and Ellena advanced ſlowly, and with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſteps, to meet him. As he drew near, he view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her aſkance, without lifting his head; but ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his large eyes looking from under the ſhade of his cowl, and the upper part of his peculiar counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Her confidence in his protection began to fail, and ſhe faultered, unable to ſpeak, and ſcarcely daring to meet his eyes. The Monk ſtalked paſt her in ſilence, the lower part of his viſage ſtill muffled in his drapery, and, as he paſſed her, looked neither with curioſity, nor ſurpriſe.</p>
                     <p>Ellena pauſed, and determined, when he ſhould be at ſome diſtance, to endeavour to make her way to the hamlet, and throw herſelf upon the humanity of its in habitants, rather than ſolicit the pity of this forbidding ſtranger. But in the next moment ſhe heard a ſtep behind her, and, on turning, ſaw the Monk again ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching. He ſtalked by as before, ſurveying her, however with a ſly and ſcrutinizing glance from the corners of his eyes. His air and countenance were equally repulſive, and ſtill Ellena could not ſummon cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage enough to attempt engaging his compaſſion; but ſhrunk as from an enemy.—There was ſomething alſo terrific in the ſilent ſtalk of ſo gigantic a form; it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced both power and treachery. He paſſed ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on to ſome diſtance, and diſappeared among the rocks.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="unknown:032735_0312_0FF496779CECCCE8"/>
Ellena turned once more with an intention of haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening towards the diſtant hamlet, before Spalatro ſhould obſerve her, whoſe ſtrange abſence ſhe had ſcarcely time to wonder at; but ſhe had not proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed far, when ſuddenly ſhe perceived the Monk again at her ſhoulder. She ſtarted, and almoſt ſhrieked; while he regarded her with more attention than before. He pauſed a moment, and ſeemed to heſitate; after which he again paſſed on in ſilence. The diſtreſs of Ellena encreaſed; he was gone the way ſhe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to run, and ſhe feared almoſt equally to follow him, and to return to her priſon. Preſently he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and paſſed her again, and Ellena haſtened forward. But, when fearful of being purſued, ſhe again looked back, ſhe obſerved him converſing with Spalatro. They appeared to be in conſultation, while they ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advanced, till, probably obſerving her rapid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, Spalatro called on her to ſtop, in a voice that echoed among all the rocks. It was a voice, which would not be diſobeyed. She looked hopeleſsly at the ſtill diſtant cottages, and ſlackened her ſteps.—Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the Monk again paſſed before her, and Spalatro had again diſappeared. The frown with which the former now regarded Ellena, was ſo terrific, that ſhe ſhrunk trembling back, though ſhe knew him not for her perſecutor, ſince ſhe had never conſciouſly ſeen Schedoni. He was agitated, and his look became darker.</p>
                     <p>"Whither go you?" ſaid he, in a voice that was ſtifled by emotion.</p>
                     <p>"Who is it, father, that aſks the queſtion?" ſaid Ellena, endeavouring to appear compoſed.</p>
                     <p>"Whither go you, and who are you!" repeated the Monk more ſternly.</p>
                     <p>"I am an unhappy orphan," replied Ellena, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deeply; "If you are, as your habit denotes, a friend to the charities, you will regard me with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="23" facs="unknown:032735_0313_0FF4961F1AA85740"/>
Schedoni was ſilent, and then ſaid—"Who and what is that you fear?"</p>
                     <p>"I fear even for my life," replied Ellena, with heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. She obſerved a darker ſhade paſs over his countenance. "For your life!" ſaid he, with apparent ſurpriſe, "who is there that would think it worth the taking."</p>
                     <p>Ellena was ſtruck with theſe words.</p>
                     <p>"Poor inſect!" added Schedoni, "who would cruſh thee?"</p>
                     <p>Ellena made no reply; ſhe remained with her eyes fixed in amazement upon his face. There was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his manner of pronouncing this, yet more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary than in the words themſelves. Alarmed by his manner, and awed by the encreaſing gloom, and ſwelling ſurge, that broke in thunder on the beach, ſhe at length turned away, and again walked towards the hamlet which was yet very remote.</p>
                     <p>He ſoon overtook her; when rudely ſeizing her arm, and gazing earneſtly on her face, "Who is it, that you fear?" ſaid he, "ſay who!"</p>
                     <p>"That is more then I dare ſay," replied Ellena, ſcarcely able to ſuſtain herſelf.</p>
                     <p>"Hah! is it even ſo!" ſaid the Monk, with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed emotion. His viſage now became ſo terrible, that Ellena ſtruggled to liberate her arm, and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated that he would not detain her. He was ſilent, and ſtill gazed upon her, but his eyes, when ſhe had ceaſed to ſtruggle, aſſumed that fixt and vacant glare of a man, whoſe thoughts have retired within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and who is no longer conſcious to ſurrounding objects.</p>
                     <p>"I beſeech you to releaſe me!" repeated Ellena, "it is late, and I am far from home."</p>
                     <p>"That is true," muttered Schedoni, ſtill graſping her arm, and ſeeming to reply to his own thoughts rather than to her words,—"that is very true."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="24" facs="unknown:032735_0314_0FF496792328BF68"/>
"The evening is cloſing faſt," continued Ellena, "and I ſhall be overtaken by the ſtorm."</p>
                     <p>Schedoni ſtill muſed, and then muttered—"The ſtorm, ſay you? Why ay, let it come."</p>
                     <p>As he ſpoke, he ſuffered her arm to drop, but ſtill held it, and walked ſlowly towards the houſe. Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, thus compelled to accompany him, and yet more alarmed both by his looks, his incoherent anſwers, and his approach to her priſon, renewed her ſupplications and her efforts for liberty, in a voice of piercing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, adding "I am far from home, father; night is coming on. See how the rocks darken! I am far from home, and ſhall be waited for."</p>
                     <p>"That is falſe!" ſaid Schedoni, with emphaſis; "and you know it to be ſo."</p>
                     <p>"Alas! I do," replied Ellena, with mingled ſhame and grief, "I have no friends to wait for me!"</p>
                     <p>"What do thoſe deſerve, who deliberately utter falſehoods," continued the Monk, "who deceive, and flatter young men to their deſtruction?"</p>
                     <p>"Father!" exclaimed the aſtoniſhed Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"Who diſturb the peace of families—who tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan with wanton arts, the heirs of noble houſes—who—hah! what do ſuch deſerve!"</p>
                     <p>Overcome with aſtoniſhment and terror, Ellena remained ſilent. She now underſtood that Schedoni, ſo far from being likely to prove a protector, was an agent of her worſt, and as ſhe had believed, her only enemy; and an apprehenſion of the immediate and terrible vengeance, which ſuch an agent ſeemed wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to accompliſh, ſubdued her ſenſes; ſhe tottered, and ſunk upon the beach. The weight, which ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the arm Schedoni held, called his attention to her ſituation.</p>
                     <p>As he gazed upon her helpleſs and faded form, he became agitated. He quitted it, and traverſed the beach in ſhort turns, and with haſty ſteps; came back

make his way between them when, Vivaldi demanded who paſſed. No anſwer was returned, and a long ſilence followed.</p>
                     <p>"We are obſerved," ſaid Bonarmo, at length, "and are even now, perhaps, almoſt beneath the poniard of the aſſaſſin: let us be gone.</p>
                     <p>"O that my heart were as ſecure from the darts of love, the aſſaſſin of my peace," exclaimed Vivaldi, "as yours is from thoſe of bravos! My friend, you have little to intereſt you, ſince your thoughts have ſo much leiſure for apprehenſion."</p>
                     <p>"My fear is that of prudence, not of weakneſs," retorted Bonarmo, with acrimony; "you will find, perhaps, that I have none, when you moſt wiſh me to poſſeſs it."</p>
                     <p>"I underſtand you," replied Vivaldi "let us finiſh this buſineſs, and you ſhall receive reparation, ſince you beleive yourſelf injured: I am as anxious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair an offence, as jealous of receiving one."</p>
                     <p>"Yes," replied Bonarmo, "you would repair the injury you have done your friend with his blood.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! never, never!" ſaid Vivaldi, falling on his neck. "Forgive my haſty violence; allow for the diſtraction of my mind."</p>
                     <p>Bonarmo returned the imbrace, "It is enough," ſaid he; "no more, no more! I hold again my friend to my heart."</p>
                     <p>While this converſation paſſed, they had quitted the orangery, and reached the walls of the villa, where they took their ſtation under a balcony that overhung the lattice, through which Vivaldi had ſeen Ellena on the preceding night. They tuned their inſtruments, and opened the ſerenade with a duet.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi's voice was a fine tenor, and the ſame ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibility, which made him paſſionately fond of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, taught him to modulate its cadence with exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite delicacy, and to give his emphaſis with the moſt
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032735_0316_0FF4967AAD258A78"/>
ſimple and pathetic expreſſion, His ſoul ſeemed to breathe in the ſounds,—ſo tender, ſo imploring, yet ſo energetic. On this night, enthuſiaſm inſpired him with the higheſt eloquence, perhaps, which muſic is capable of attaining; what might be its effect on Ellena he had no means of judging, for ſhe did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear either at the balcony or the lattice, nor give any hint of applauſe. No ſounds ſtole on the ſtillneſs of the night, except thoſe of the ſerenade, nor did any light from within the villa break upon the obſcurity without; once, indeed, in a pauſe of the inſtruments Bonarmo fancied he diſtinguiſhed voices near him, as of perſons who feared to be heard, and he liſtened at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively, but without aſcertaining the truth. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they ſeemed to ſound heavily in his ear, and then a death-like ſilence prevailed. Vivaldi affirmed the ſound to be nothing more than the confuſed murmur of the diſtant multitude on the ſhore, but Bonarmo was not thus eaſily convinced.</p>
                     <p>The muſicians, unſucceſsful in their firſt endeavour to attract attention, removed to the oppoſite ſide of the building, and placed themſelves in front of the portico, but with as little ſucceſs, and, after having exerciſed their powers of harmony and of patience for above an hour, they reſigned all further effort to win upon the obdurate Ellena. Vivaldi, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the feebleneſs of his firſt hope of ſeeing her, now ſuffered an agony of diſappointment; and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narmo, alarmed for the conſequence of his deſpair, was as anxious to perſuade him that he had no rival, as he had lately been pertinacious in affirming that he had one.</p>
                     <p>At length they left the gardens, Vivaldi, proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he would not reſt until he had diſcovered the ſtranger, who ſo wantonly deſtroyed his peace, and had compelled him to explain his ambiguous warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and Bonarmo remonſtrating on the imprudence
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:032735_0317_0FF4962229C0B498"/>
and difficulty of the ſearch, and repreſenting that ſuch conduct would probably be the means of ſpreading a report of his attachment, where moſt he dreaded it ſhould be known,</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi refuſed to yeild to remonſtrance or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of any kind. "We ſhall ſee," ſaid he, "whether this demon in the garb of a monk, will haunt me again at the accuſtomed place; if he does, he ſhall not eſcape my graſp; and if he does not, I will watch as vigilantly for his return, as he ſeems to have done for mine. I will lurk in the ſhade of the ruin, and wait for him, though it be till death!"</p>
                     <p>Bonarmo was particularly ſtruck by the vehemence which he pronounced the laſt words, but he no longer oppoſed his purpoſe, and only bade him conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was well armed, "For" he added, "you may have need of arms there, though you had no uſe for them at the villa Altieri. Remember that the ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er told you that your ſteps were watched."</p>
                     <p>"I have my ſword," replied Vivaldi, "and the dagger which I uſually wear; but I ought to enquire what are your weapons of defence."</p>
                     <p>"Huſh!" ſaid Bornarmo, as they turned the foot of a rock that overhung the road," we are approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpot; yonder is the arch!" It appeared duſki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the perſpective, ſuſpended between two cliffs, where the road wound from ſight, on one of which were the ruins of the Roman fort it belonged to, and on the other, ſhadowing pines, and thickets of oak that tufted the rock to its baſe.</p>
                     <p>They proceeded in ſilence, treading lightly, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten throwing a ſuſpicious glance around, expecting every inſtant that the monk would ſteal out upon them from ſome receſs of the cliffs. But they paſſed on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleſted to the arch-way. "We are here before him, however," ſaid Vivaldi as they entered the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, "Speak low<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my friend," ſaid Bonarmo, "o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032735_0318_0FF4967C3305A928"/>
beſides ourſelves may be ſhrouded in this obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. I like not the place."</p>
                     <p>"Who but ourſelves would chuſe ſo diſmal a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat?" whiſpered Vivaldi, "unleſs indeed, it were banditti; the ſavageneſs of the ſpot would, in truth, ſuit their humour, and it ſuits well alſo with my own."</p>
                     <p>"It would ſuit their purpoſe too, as well as their humour," obſerved Bonarmo. "Let us remove from this deep ſhade, into the more open road, where we can as cloſely obſerve who paſſes.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi objected that in the road they might them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be obſerved, "and if we are ſeen by my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tormentor, our deſign is defeated, for he comes upon us ſuddenly, or not at all, leſt we ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to detain him.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, as he ſaid this, took his ſtation within the thickeſt gloom of the arch, which was of conſiderable depth, and near a flight of ſteps that was cut in the rock, and aſcended to the fortreſs. His friend ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped cloſe to his ſide. After a pauſe of ſilence, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which Bonarmo was meditating, and Vivaldi was impatiently watching, "do you really believe," ſaid the former, "that any effort to detain him would be effectual? He glided paſt me with a ſtrange faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it was ſurely more than human!"</p>
                     <p>"What is it you mean?" enquired Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Why, I mean that I could be ſuperſtitious. This place, perhaps, infects my mind with congenial gloom, for I find that, at this moment, there is ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſuperſtition too dark for my credulity."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi ſmiled. "And you muſt allow," added Bonarmo, "that he has appeared under circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſomewhat extraordinary. How ſhould he know your name, by which you ſay he addreſſed you at the firſt meeting? How ſhould he know from whence you came, or whether you deſigned to return? By what magic could he become acquainted with your plans?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="unknown:032735_0319_0FF4962C8AADF688"/>
"Nor am I certain that he is acquainted with them," obſerved Vivaldi; "but if he is, there was no neceſſity for ſuperhuman means to obtain ſuch knowledge."</p>
                     <p>"The reſult of this evening ſurely ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you that he is acquainted with your deſigns," ſaid Bonarmo. Do you believe it poſſible that Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na could have been inſenſible to your attentions, if her heart had not been pre-engaged, and that ſhe would not have ſhewn herſelf at a lattice?"</p>
                     <p>"You do not know Ellena," replied Vivaldi, "and therefore I once more pardon you the queſtion. Yet had ſhe been diſpoſed to accept my addreſſes, ſurely ſome ſign of approbation,"—he checked himſelf.</p>
                     <p>"The ſtranger warned you not to go to the villa Altieri," reſumed Bonarmo, "he ſeemed to anticipate the reception which awaited you, and to know a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which hitherto you have happily eſcaped."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, he anticipated too well that reception," ſaid Vivaldi, loſing, his prudence in paſſionate exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; "and he is himſelf, perhaps, the rival, whom he has taught me to ſuſpect. He has aſſumed a diſguiſe only the more effectually to impoſe upon my credulity, and do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> me from addreſſing Ellena. And ſhall I tamely lie in wait for his approach? Shall I lurk like a guilty aſſaſſin for his rival?"</p>
                     <p>"For heaven's ſake!" ſaid Bonarmo, "moderate theſe tranſports; conſider where you are. This ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of yours is in the higheſt degree improbable." He gave his reaſons for thinking ſo, and theſe convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Vivaldi, who was prevailed upon to be once more patient.</p>
                     <p>They had remained watchful and ſtill for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time, when Bonarmo ſaw a perſon approach the end of the arch-way neareſt to Altieri. He heard no ſtep, but he perceived a ſhadowy figure ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion itſelf at the entrance of the arch, where the twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032735_0320_0FF49687556ED8D0"/>
of this brilliant climate was, for a few paces, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Vivaldi's eyes were fixed on the road lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards Naples, and he, therefore, did not perceive the object of Bonarmo's attention, who, fearful of his friend's precipitancy, forbore to point out immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what he obſerved, judging it more prudent to watch the motions of this unknown perſon, that he might aſcertain whether it really were the monk. The ſize of the figure, and the dark drapery in which it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wrapt, induced him, at length, to believe that this was the expected ſtranger; and he ſeized Vivaldi's arm to direct his attention to him, when the form glided forward diſappeared in the gloom, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Vivaldi had underſtood the occaſion of his friend's geſture and ſignificant ſilence. They heard no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep paſs them, and, being convinced that this perſon, whatever he was, had not left the arch-way, they kept their ſtation in watchful ſtillneſs. Preſently they heard a ruſtling, as of garments, near them, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, unable longer to command his patience, ſtarted from his concealment, and with arms extended to prevent any one from eſcaping, demanded who was there.</p>
                     <p>The ſound ceaſed, and no reply was made. Bonarmo drew his ſword, proteſting he would ſtab the air till he found the perſon who lurked there; but if the latter would diſcover himſelf, he ſhould receive no injury. This aſſurance Vivaldi confirmed by his promiſe. Still no anſwer was returned; but as they liſtened for a voice, they thought ſomething paſſed them, and the avenue was not narrow enough to have prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a circumſtance. Vivaldi ruſhed forward, but did not perceive any perſon iſſue from the arch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the highway, where the ſtronger twilight muſt have diſcovered him.</p>
                     <p>"Somebody certainly paſſed," whiſpered Bonar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, "and I think I hear a ſound from yonder ſteps, that lead to the fortreſs."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="unknown:032735_0321_0FF4962E12399E70"/>
"Let us follow," cried Vivaldi, and he began to aſcend.</p>
                     <p>"Stop, for heaven's ſake ſtop!" ſaid Bonarmo; "conſider what you are about! Do not brave the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darkneſs of theſe ruins; do not purſue the aſſaſſin to his den!"</p>
                     <p>"It is the monk himſelf! exclaimed Vivaldi, ſtill aſcending; "he ſhall not eſcape me!"</p>
                     <p>Bonarmo pauſed a moment at the foot of the ſteps, and his friend diſappeared; he heſitated what to do, till aſhamed of ſuffering him to encounter danger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, he ſprang to the flight, and not without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſurmounted the rugged ſteps.</p>
                     <p>Having reached the ſummit of the rock, he found himſelf on a terrace, that ran along the top of the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and had once been fortified; this, croſſing the road, commanded the defile each way. Some remains of maſſy walls, that ſtill exhibited loops for archers, were all that now hinted of its former uſe. It led to a watch-tower almoſt concealed in thick pines, that crowned the oppoſite cliff, and had thus ſerved not only for a ſtrong battery over the road, but connecting the oppoſite ſides of the defile, had formed a line of communication between the fort and this out-poſt.</p>
                     <p>Bonarmo looked round in vain for his friend, and the echoes of his own voice only, among the rocks, replied to his repeated calls. After ſome heſitation whether to enter the walls of the main building, or to croſs to the watch-tower, he determined on the former, and entered a rugged area, the walls of which, following the declivities of the precipice, could ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now be traced. The citadel, a round tower, of majeſtic ſtrength, with ſome Roman arches ſcattered near, was all that remained of this once important fortreſs; except, indeed, a maſs of ruins near the edge of the cliff, the conſtruction of which made it difficult to gueſs for what purpoſe it had been deſigned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="unknown:032735_0322_0FF49688DE8B9480"/>
Bonarmo entered the immenſe walls of the citadel, but the utter darkneſs within checked his progreſs, and, contenting himſelf with calling loudly on Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, he returned to the open air.</p>
                     <p>As he approached the maſs of ruins, whoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular form had intereſted his curioſity, he thought he diſtinguiſhed the low accents of a human voice, and while he liſtened in anxiety, a perſon ruſhed forth from a door-way of the ruin, carrying a drawn ſword. It was Vivaldi himſelf. Bonarmo ſprang to meet him; he was pale and breathleſs, and ſome moments elapſed before he could ſpeak, or appeared to hear the repeated enquiries of his friend.</p>
                     <p>"Let us go," ſaid Vivaldi, "let us leave this place."</p>
                     <p>"Moſt willingly," replied Bonarmo, "but where have you been, and who have you ſeen, that you are thus affected?"</p>
                     <p>"Aſk me no more queſtions, let us go," repeated Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>They deſcended the rock together, and when having reached the arch way, Bonarmo enquired, half ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, whether they ſhould remain any longer on the watch, his friend anſwered, "No!" with an emphaſis that ſtartled him. They paſſed haſtily on the way to Naples, Bonarmo repeating enquiries which Vivaldi ſeemed reluctant to ſatisfy, and wondering no leſs at the cauſe of this ſudden reſerve, than anxious to know whom he had ſeen.</p>
                     <p>"It was the monk, then," ſaid Bonarmo; "you ſecured him at laſt?"</p>
                     <p>"I know not what to think," replied Vivaldi, "I am more perplexed than ever."</p>
                     <p>"He eſcaped you then?"</p>
                     <p>"We will ſpeak of this in future," ſaid Vivaldi; "but be it as it may, the buſineſs reſts not here. I will return in the night of to-morrow with a torch; dare you venture yourſelf with me?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="unknown:032735_0323_0FF4962F9B0ABAC0"/>
"I know not," replied Bonarmo, "whether I ought to do ſo, ſince I am not informed for what purpoſe?"</p>
                     <p>"I will not preſs you to go," ſaid Vivaldi; my purpoſe is already known to you."</p>
                     <p>"Have you really failed to diſcover the ſtranger—have you ſtill doubts concerning the perſon you pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued?"</p>
                     <p>I have doubts, which to-morrow night, I hope will diſſipate."</p>
                     <p>"This is very ſtrange!" ſaid Bonarmo, "It was but now that I witneſſed the horror, with which you left this fortreſs of Puluzzi, and already you ſpeak of returning to it!. And why at night—why not in the day, when leſs danger would beſet you?"</p>
                     <p>"I know not as to that," replied Vivaldi, "you are to obſerve that day-light never pierces within the receſs, to which I penetrated; we muſt ſearch the place with torches at whatſoever hour we would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine it."</p>
                     <p>"Since this is neceſſary," ſaid Bonarmo, "how happens it that you found your way in total darkneſs?"</p>
                     <p>"I was too much engaged to know how; I was led on, as by an inviſible hand."</p>
                     <p>"We muſt, notwithſtanding," obſerved Banarmo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "go in day-time, if not by day-light, provided I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company you. It would be little leſs than inſanity to go twice to a place, which is probably infeſted with robbers, and at their own hour of midnight."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall watch again in the accuſtomed place," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Vivaldi, "before I uſe my laſt reſource, and this cannot be done during the day. Beſides, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that I ſhould go at a particular hour, the hour when the monk has uſually appeared.</p>
                     <p>"He did eſcape you, then?" ſaid Bonarmo, "and you are ſtill ignorant concerning who he is?"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi rejoined only with an enquiry whether his friend would accompany him. "If not," he added<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "I muſt hope to find another companion."</p>

Bonarmo ſaid, that he muſt conſider of the propoſal, and would acquaint him with his determination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the following evening.</p>

He opened it, and proceeded along the ſilent paſſages, towards the private ſtair-caſe, often pauſing to liſten and then ſtepping more lightly;—the terrific Schedoni, in this moment of meditative guilt, feared even the feeble Ellena. At the foot of the ſtair-caſe, he again ſtopped to liſten. "Do you here any thing?"' ſaid he in a whiſper.</p>
                     <p>"I hear only the ſea," replied the man.</p>
                     <p>"Huſh! it is ſomething more!" ſaid Schedoni; "that is the murmur of voices!"</p>
                     <p>They were ſilent. After a pauſe of ſome length, "It is, perhaps, the voice of the ſpectres I told you of, Signor," ſaid Spalatro, with a ſneer. "Give me the dagger," ſaid Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>Spalatro, inſtead of obeying, now graſped the arms of the Confeſſor, who, looking at him for an explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this extraordinary action, was ſtill more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to obſerve the paleneſs and horror of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. His ſtarting eyes ſeemed to follow ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject along the paſſage, and Schedoni, who began to partake of his feelings, looked forward to diſcover what occaſioned this diſmay, but could not perceive any thing that juſtified it. "What is it you fear?" ſaid he at length.</p>
                     <p>Spaltro's eyes were ſtill moving in horror. "Do you ſee nothing!" ſaid he pointing. Schedoni look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again, but did not diſtinguiſh any object in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote gloom of the paſſage, whether Spalatro's ſight was now fixed.</p>
                     <p>"Come, come," ſaid he, aſhamed of his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, "this is not a moment for ſuch fancies. Awake from this idle dream."</p>
                     <p>Spalatro withdrew his eyes, but they retained all their wildneſs "It was no dream," ſaid he in the voice of a man who is exhauſted by pain, and begins to breathe ſomewhat more freely again "I ſaw it as plainly as I now ſee you."</p>
                     <p>

"Dotard! what did you ſee!" enquired the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor.</p>
                     <p>"It came before my eyes in a moment, and ſhewed itſelf diſtinctly and outſpread."</p>

                        </gap> itſelf? repeated Schedoni."</p>
                     <p>"And then it beckoned—yes it beckoned me, with that blood-ſtained finger! and glided away down the paſſage ſtill beckoning—till it was loſt in the darkneſs."</p>
                     <p>"This is very frenzy!" ſaid Schedoni, exceſſively agitated. "Arouſe yourſelf, and be a man!</p>
                     <p>"Frenzy! would it were, Signor. I ſaw that dreadful hand—I ſee it now—it is there again!—there!"</p>
                     <p>Schedoni, ſhocked, embarraſſed, and once more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the ſtrange emotions of Spalatro, looked forward, expecting to diſcover ſome terrific object, but, ſtill nothing was viſible to him, and he ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered himſelf ſufficiently to endeavour to appeaſe the fancy of this conſcience-ſtruck ruffian. But Spalatro was inſenſible to all he could urge, and the Confeſſor, fearing that his voice, though weak and ſtifled, would awaken Ellena, tried to withdraw him from the ſpot, to the apartment they had quitted.</p>
                     <p>"The wealth of San Loretto, ſhould not make me go that way, Signor," replied he, ſhuddering—"that was they way <hi>it</hi> beckoned, it vaniſhed that way!"</p>
                     <p>Every emotion now yielded with Schedoni, to that of apprehenſion, leſt Ellena, being awakened, ſhould make his taſk more horrid by a ſtruggle, and his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment encreaſed at each inſtant, for neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, menace or entreaty could prevail with Spala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro to retire, till the Monk luckily remembered a door which opened beyond the ſtair-caſe, would conduct them by another way to the oppoſite ſide of the houſe. The man conſented ſo to depart, when Schedoni, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locking a ſuit of rooms, of which he had always kept
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:032735_0329_0FF4963E4DD13B40"/>
the keys, they paſſed in ſilence through an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of deſolate chambers, till they reached the one which they had lately left.</p>
                     <p>Here, relieved from apprehenſion reſpecting Ellena, the Confeſſor expoſtulated more freely with Spalatro; but neither argument nor menace could prevail, and the man perſiſted in refuſing to return to the ſtair-caſe, though proteſting, at the ſame time, that he would not remain alone in any part of the houſe, till the wine, with which the Confeſſor abundantly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied him, began to overcome the terrors of his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. At length, his courage was ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated, that he conſented to reſume his ſtation, and await at the foot of the ſtairs the accompliſhment of Schedoni's dreadful errand, with which agreement they returned thither by the way they had lately paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The wine, with which Schedoni alſo had found it neceſſary to ſtrengthen his own reſolution, did not ſecure him from ſevere emotion, when he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf again near Ellena; but he made a ſtrenous effort for ſelf ſubjection, as he demanded the dagger of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latro.</p>
                     <p>"You have it, already, Signor," replied the man.</p>
                     <p>"True," ſaid the Monk;" aſcend ſoftly, or our ſteps may awaken her."</p>
                     <p>"You ſaid I was to wait at the foot of the ſtairs, Signor, while you"—</p>
                     <p>"True, true, true!" muttered the Confeſſor, and had begun to aſcend, when his attendant deſired him to ſtop. "You are going in darkneſs, Signor, you have forgotten the lamp. I have another here."</p>
                     <p>Schedoni took it angrily, without ſpeaking, and was again aſcending, when he heſitated, and once more pauſed. "The glare will diſturb her," thought he, "it is better to go in darkneſs—Yet—"He conſidered, that he could nor ſtrike with certainty without light to direct his hand, and he kept the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:032735_0330_0FF49697D7331E10"/>
lamp, but returned once more to charge Spalatro not to ſtir from the foot of the ſtairs till he called, and to aſcend to the chamber upon the firſt ſignal.</p>
                     <p>"I will obey, Signor, if you, on your part, will promiſe not to give the ſignal till all is over."</p>
                     <p>"I do promiſe," replied Schedoni. "No more!"</p>
                     <p>Again he aſcended, nor ſtopped till he reached El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena's door, where he liſtened for a ſound; but all was as ſilent as if death already reigned in the chamber. This door was from long diſuſe, difficult to be opened; formerly it would have yielded without ſound, but now Schedoni was fearful of noiſe from every effort he made to move it. After ſome difficulty, however, it gave way, and he perceived, by the ſtillneſs within the apartment, that he had not diſturbed Ellena. He ſhaded the lamp with the door for a moment, while he threw an enquiring glance forward, and when he did venture farther, held part of his dark drapery before the light to prevent the rays from ſpreading through the room.</p>
                     <p>As he approached the bed, her gentle breathings informed him that ſhe ſtill ſlept, and the next moment he was at herſide. She lay in deep and peaceful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>While Schedoni gazed for a moment upon her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent countenance, a faint ſmile ſtole over it. He ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped back." She ſmiles in her murderer's face!" ſaid he, ſhuddering, "I muſt be ſpeedy."</p>
                     <p>He ſearched for the dagger, and it was ſome time before his trembling hand could diſengage it from the folds of his garment; but, having done ſo, he again drew near, and prepared to ſtrike. Her dreſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed him; it would interrupt the blow, and he ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to examine whether he could turn her robe aſid
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:032735_0331_0FF4963FD2C05E88"/>
without waking her. As the light paſſed over her face, he perceived that the ſmile had vaniſhed—the viſions of her ſleep were changed, for tears ſtole from beneath her eye lids, and her features ſuffered a ſlight convulſion. She ſpoke! Schedoni, apprehending that the light had diſturbed her, ſuddenly drew back, and again irreſolute, ſhaded the lamp and concealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf behind the curtain, while he liſtened. But her words were inward and indiſtinct, and convinced him that ſhe ſtill ſlumbered.</p>
                     <p>His agitation and repugnance to ſtrike, encreaſed with every moment of delay, and as often as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to plunge the poignard in her boſom, a ſhudder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing horror reſtrained him. Aſtoniſhed at his own feelings, and indignant at what he termed a daſtardly weakneſs, he found it neceſſary to argue with himſelf, and his rapid thoughts ſaid, "Do I not feel the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of this act? Does not what is dearer to me than exiſtence—does not my conſequence depend on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of it? Is ſhe not alſo beloved by the young Vivaldi?—have I already forgotten the church of the Spirito Santo?" This conſideration reanimated him; vengeance nerved his arm, and drawing aſide the lawn from her boſom, he once more raiſed it to ſtrike; when after gazing for an inſtant, ſome new cauſe of horror ſeemed to ſeize all his frame, and he ſtood for ſome moments aghaſt and motionleſs like a ſtatue. His reſpiration was ſhort and laborious, chilly drops ſtood on his fore hand, and all his faculties of the mind ſeemed ſupended. When he recovered, he ſtooped to examine again the miniature, which had occaſioned this revolution, and which had lain concealed beneath the lawn that he withdrew. The terrible certainty was almoſt confirmed, and forgetting, in his impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to know the truth, the imprudence of ſuddenly diſcovering himſelf to Ellena at this hour of the night, and with a dagger at his feet, he called loudly. "A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake!
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:032735_0332_0FF496995E4246E0"/>
awake! Say, what is your name! Speak ſpeak quickly!</p>
                     <p>Ellena, arouſed by a man's voice, ſtarted from her mattreſs, when, perceiving Schedoni, and by the pale glare of the lamp, his haggard countenance, ſhe ſhriek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſunk back on the pillow. She had not faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and believing that he came to murder her, ſhe now exerted herſelf to plead for mercy. The ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of her feelings enabled her to riſe and throw herſelf at his feet. "Be merciful, O father! be merciful! ſaid ſhe, in a trembling voice.</p>
                     <p>"Father, interrupted Schedoni<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with earneſtneſs; and then ſeeming to reſtrain himſelf, he added, with unaffected ſurpiſe, "Why are you thus terrified?" for he had loſt, in new intereſts and emotions, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of evil intention, and of the ſingularity of his ſituation. "What do you fear?" he repeated.</p>
                     <p>"Have pity, holy father!" exclaimed Ellena in agony.</p>
                     <p>"Why do you not ſay whoſe portrait that is?" de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded he, forgetting that he had not aſked the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before.</p>
                     <p>"Whoſe portrait?" repeated the Confeſſor in a loud voice.</p>
                     <p>"Whoſe portrait!" ſaid Ellena, with extreme ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.</p>
                     <p>"Ay, how came you by it? Be quick—whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance is it?"</p>
                     <p>"Why ſhould you wiſh to know?" ſaid Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"Anſwer my queſtion," repeated Schedoni, with encreaſing ſternneſs.</p>
                     <p>"I cannot part with it, holy father," replied El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena, preſſing it to her boſom, "you do not wiſh me to part with!"</p>
                     <p>"Is it impoſſible to make you anſwer my queſtion!" ſaid he, in extreme perturbation, and turning away from her, "has fear utterly confounded you!" Then, again ſtepping towards her, and ſeizing her wriſt, he epeated the demand in a tone of deſperation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="43" facs="unknown:032735_0333_0FF4964158349438"/>
"Alas! he is dead! or I ſhould not now want a protector, replied Ellena, ſhrinking from his graſp, and weeping.</p>
                     <p>"You trifle," ſaid Schedoni, with a terrible look, "I once more demand an anſwe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Ellena lifted it, gazed upon it for a momemt, and then preſſing it to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Your father!" he repeated in an inward voice, "your father!" and ſhuddering turned away.</p>
                     <p>Ellena looked at him with ſurpriſe. "I never knew a father's care," ſhe ſaid, nor till lately did I perceive the want of it.—But now."—</p>
                     <p>"His name?" interrupted the Confeſſor.</p>
                     <p>"But now," continued Ellena—"if you are not as a father to me—to whom can I look for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection?"</p>
                     <p>"His name," repeated Schedoni, with ſterner em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis.</p>
                     <p>"It is ſacred," replied Ellena, "for he was unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate!"</p>
                     <p>"His name?" demanded the Confeſſor, furiouſly,</p>
                     <p>"I have promiſed to conceal it, father."</p>
                     <p>"On your life, I charge you tell it; remember, on your life!"</p>
                     <p>Ellena trembled, was ſilent, and with ſupplicating looks implored him to deſiſt from enquiry, but he urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the queſtion more irreſiſtibly. "His name than," ſaid ſhe. "was Marinella."</p>
                     <p>Schedoni groaned and turned away; but in a few ſeconds, ſtruggling to command the agitation that ſhattered his whole frame, he returned to Ellena, and raiſed her from her knees, on which ſhe had thrown herſelf to implore mercy.</p>
                     <p>"The place of his reſidence?" ſaid the Monk.</p>
                     <p>"It was far from hence," ſhe replied; but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded an unequivocal anſwer, and ſhe reluctantly gave one.</p>

                        <pb n="44" facs="unknown:032735_0334_0FF4969AE4EF9CB8"/>
Schedoni turned away as before, groaned heavily, and paced the chamber without ſpeaking; while El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena in her turn, enquired the motive of his queſtions, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>en up to his feelings, was inflexibly ſilent, while he ſtalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with meaſured ſteps along the room, and his face half hid by his cowl, was bent towards the ground.</p>
                     <p>Ellena's terror began to yield to aſtoniſhment, and this emotion encreaſed, when Schedoni approaching her, ſhe perceived tears ſwell in his eyes, which were fixt on her's and his countenance ſoften from the wild diſorder that had marked it. Still he could not ſpeak. At length he yielded to the fullneſs of his heart, and Schedoni, the ſtern Schedoni wept and ſighed! He ſeated himſelf on the mattreſs beſide Ellena, took her hand, which, ſhe affrighted, attempted to withdraw, and when he could command his voice, ſaid, "Unhappy child!—behold your more unhappy father!" As he concluded, his voice was evercome by groans, and he drew the cowl entirely over his face.</p>
                     <p>"My father!" exclaimed the aſtoniſhed and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ellena—"my father!" and fixed her eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. He gave no reply, but when, a moment af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he lifted his head, "Why do you reproach me with thoſe looks! ſaid the conſcious Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>"Reproach you!—reproach my father!" repeated Ellena, in accents ſoftening into tenderneſs, <hi>Why</hi> ſhould I reproach my father!</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>"Why?"</hi> exclaimed Schedoni, ſtarting from his ſeat, "Great God!"</p>
                     <p>As he moved, he ſtumbled over the dagger at his foot; at that moment it might be ſaid to ſtrike into his heart. He puſhed it haſtily from his ſight, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena had not obſerved it; but ſhe obſerved his labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breaſt, his diſtracted looks, and quick ſteps as he walked to and fro in the chamber; and ſhe aſked, with
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:032735_0335_0FF4964BF2BBAFA8"/>
the moſt ſoothing accents of compaſſions, and looks of anxious gentleneſs, what made him ſo unhappy, and tried to aſſuage his ſufferings. They ſeemed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe with every wiſh ſhe expreſſed to diſpel them; at one moment he would pauſe to gaze upon her, and in the next would quit her with a frenzied ſtart.</p>
                     <p>"Why do you look ſo piteouſly upon me, father?" Ellena ſaid, "why are you ſo unhappy? Tell me, that I may comfort you,"</p>
                     <p>This appeal renewed all the violence of remorſe and grief, and he preſſed her to his boſom, and wetted her cheek with his tears. Ellena wept to ſee him weep till her doubts began to take alarm. Whatever might be the proofs, that had convinced Schedoni of the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionſhip between them, he had not explained theſe to her, and, however ſtrong was the eloquence of nature which ſhe witneſſed, it was not ſufficient to juſtify an entire confidence in the aſſertion he had made, or to allow her to permit his careſſes without trembling. She ſhrunk, and endeavoured to diſengage herſelf; when, immediately underſtanding her, he ſaid, "Can you doubt the cauſe of theſe emotions? theſe ſigns of paternal affection?"</p>
                     <p>"Have I not reaſon to doubt," replied Ellena, timid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly "ſince I never witneſſed them before?"</p>
                     <p>He withdrew his arms, and fixing his eyes earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on hers, regarded her for ſome moments, in expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſilence, "Poor Innocent!" ſaid he, at length, "you know not how much your words convey!—It is too true, you never have known a father's tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs till now!"</p>
                     <p>His countenance darkened while he ſpoke, and he roſe again from his ſeat. Ellena, meanwhile, aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, terrified and oppreſſed by a variety of emotoins and no power to demand his reaſons for the belief that ſo much agitated him, or any explanation of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; but ſhe appealed to the portrait, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:032735_0336_0FF496A4CAE65820"/>
by tracing ſome reſemblance between it and Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni, to decide her doubts. The countenance of each was as different in character as in years. The mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature diſplayed a young man, rather handſome, of a gay and ſmiling countenance; yet the ſmile expreſſed triumph, rather than ſweetneſs, and his whole air and features were diſtinguiſhed by a conſciouſneſs of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority that roſe even to haughtineſs.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni, on the contrary, advanced in years, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited a ſevere phyſiognomy, furrowed by thought, no leſs than by time, and darkened by the habitual indulgence of moroſe paſſions. He looked as if he had never ſmiled ſince the portrait was drawn; and it ſeemed as if the painter, prophetic of Schedoni's future diſpoſition, had arreſted and embodied that ſmile to prove, hereafter, that cheerfulneſs had once played upon his features.</p>
                     <p>Though the expreſſion was ſo different between the countenance, which Schedoni formerly owned, and that he now wore the ſame character of haughty pride was viſible in both; and Ellena did trace a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance in the bold outline of the features, but not ſufficient to convince her, without farther evidence, that each belonged to the ſame perſon, and that the Confeſſor had ever been the young cavalier in the portrait. In the firſt tumult of her thoughts, ſhe had not had leiſure to dwell upon the ſingularity of Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni's viſiting her at this deep hour of the night, or to urge any queſtions, except vague ones, concerning the truth of her relationſhip to him. But now, that her mind was ſomewhat recollected, and that his looks were leſs terrific, ſhe ventured to aſk a fuller explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe circumſtances, and his reaſons for the late extraordinary aſſertion. "It is paſt midnight, father ſaid Ellena, "you may judge then how anxious I am to learn, what motive led you to my chamber at this lonely hour?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="47" facs="unknown:032735_0337_0FF4964D7AA31008"/>
Schedoni made no reply.</p>
                     <p>"Did you come to warn me of my danger?" ſhe continued, "had you diſcovered the cruel deſigns of Spalatro? Ah! when I ſupplicated for your compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the ſhore this evening, you little thought what perils ſurrounded me! or you would—."</p>
                     <p>"You ſay true! interrupted he, in a hurried man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, "but name the ſubject no more. Why will you perſiſt in returning to it?"</p>
                     <p>His words ſurprized Ellena, who had not even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to the ſubject till now; but the returning wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his countenance, made her fearful of dwelling upon the topic, even ſo far as to point out his error.</p>
                     <p>Another deep pauſe ſucceeded, during which Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni continued to pace the room, ſometimes ſtopping for an inſtant, to fix his eyes on Ellena, and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her with an earneſtneſs that ſeemed to partake of frenzy, and then gloomily withdrawing his regards, and ſighing heavily, as he turned away to a diſtant part of the room. She, meanwhile, agitated with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment at his conduct, as well as at her own circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and with the fear of offending him by further queſtions, endeavoured to ſummon courage to ſolicit the explanation which was ſo important to her tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity. At length ſhe aſked, how ſhe might ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to believe a circumſtance ſo ſurpriſing, as that of which he had juſt aſſured her, and to remind him that he had not yet diſcloſed his reaſon for admitting the belief.</p>
                     <p>The Confeſſor's feelings were eloquent in reply; and, when at length they were ſufficiently ſubdued, to permit him to talk coherently, he mentioned ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances concerning Ellena's family, that proved him at leaſt to have been intimately acquainted with it; and others, which ſhe believed were known only to Bianchi and herſelf, that removed every doubt of his identity.</p>
                     <p>This, however, was a period of his life too big with
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:032735_0338_0FF496A652EFABE8"/>
remorſe, horror, and the firſt pangs of parental affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to allow him to converſe long; deep ſolitude was neceſſary for his ſoul. He wiſhed to plunge where no eye might reſtrain his emotions or obſerve the overflowing anguiſh of his heart. Having obtained ſufficient proof to convince him that Ellena was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his child, and aſſured her that ſhe ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from this houſe on the following day, and be reſtored to her home, he abruptly left the chamber.</p>
                     <p>As he deſcended the ſtair-caſe, Spalatro ſtepped for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to meet him, the cloak which had been deſigned to wrap the mangled form of Ellena, when it ſhould be carried to the ſhore. "Is it done?" ſaid the ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fian, in a ſtiffled voice; "I am ready;" and he ſpread forth the cloak, and began to aſcend.</p>
                     <p>"Hold! villian, hold! ſaid Schedoni, lifting up his head for the firſt time, "Dare to enter that chamber, and your life ſhall anſwer fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"What!" exclaimed the man, ſhinking back aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed—"will not <hi>her's</hi> ſatisfy you?"</p>
                     <p>He trembled for the conſequence of what he had ſaid, when he obſerved the changing countenance of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"Avaunt!" exclaimed the other, turning fiercely upon him; "leave me."</p>

                     <p>"Villian! fiend! <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> cried Schedoni, ſeizing the ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fian by the throat, with a graſp that ſeemed intended to annihilate him; when, recollecting that the fellow was only willing to obey the very inſtructions he had
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:032735_0339_0FF4964F06F4B748"/>
himſelf but lately delivered to him, or other emotions ſucceeded to that of rage; he ſlowly liberated him, and in accents broken, and ſoftening from ſternneſs, bade him retire to reſt. "To-morrow," he added, "I will ſpeak further with you. As for this night—I have changed my purpoſe. Begone!"</p>
                     <p>Spalatro was about to expreſs the indignation, which aſtoniſhment and fear had hitherto overcome, but his employer repeated his command in a voice of thunder, and cloſed the door of his apartment with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as he ſhut out a man whoſe preſence was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come hateful to him. He felt relieved by his abſence, and began to breathe more freely, till remembering that this accomplice had juſt boaſted that he was no daſtard, he dreaded leſt by way of proving the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſhould attempt to commit the crime, from which he had lately ſhrunk. Terrified at the poſſibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and even apprehending that it might already have become a reality, he ruſhed from the room, and found Spalatro in the paſſage leading to the private ſtair-caſe; but, whatever might have been his purpoſe, the ſituation and looks of the latter were ſufficiently alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. At the approach of Schedoni, he turned his ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Thither Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni followed, and, having locked him in it for the night, he reparied to the apartment of Ellena, which he ſecured from the poſſibility of intruſion. He then returned to his own, not to ſleep, but to abandon himſelf to the agonies of remorſe and horror; and he yet ſhuddered, like a man who has juſt recoiled from the brink of a precipice, but who ſtill me ſures the gulf with his eye.</p>

                     <p>EELLENA, when Schedoni had left her, recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected all the particulars, which he had thought proper to reveal concerning her family, and comparing them with ſuch circumſtances as the late Bianchi had related on the ſame ſubject, ſhe perceived nothing that was contradictory between the two accounts But ſhe knew not even yet enough of her own ſtory, to underſtand why Bianchi had been ſilent as to ſome particulars, which had juſt been diſcloſed. From Bianchi ſhe had always underſtood, that her mother had married a nobleman of the duchy of Milan, and of the houſe of Marinella; that the marriage had been unfortunate; and that ſhe herſelf, even before the death of the Counteſs, had been committed to the care of Bianchi, the only ſiſter of that lady. Of this event, or of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Ellena had no remembrance; for the kindneſs of Bianchi had obliterated from her mind the loſs and the griefs of her early infancy; and ſhe recollected only the accident which had diſcovered to her, in Bianchi's cabinet, after the death of the latter, the minature and the name of her father. When ſhe had enquired the reaſon of this injunction Bianchi replied, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded fortune of her houſe rendered privacy deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and anſwered her further queſtions concerning her father, by relating, that he had died while ſhe was an infant. The picture, which Ellena had diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Bianchi had found among the trinkets of the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Counteſs, and deſigned to preſent it at ſome future
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:032735_0341_0FF49702D76C5680"/>
perid to Ellena, when her diſcretion might he truſted with a knowledge of her family. This was the whole of what Signora Bianchi had judged it neceſſary to explain, though in her laſt hours it appeared that ſhe wiſhed to reveal more; but it was then too late.</p>
                     <p>Though Ellena perceived that many circumſtances of the relations given by Schedoni, and by Signora Bianchi, coincided, and that none were contradictory, except that of his death, ſhe could not yet ſubdue her amazement at this diſcovery or even the doubts which occaſionally recurred to her as to its truth. Schedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, on the contrary, had not even appeared ſurprized, when ſhe aſſured him, that ſhe always underſtood her father had been dead many years; though when ſhe aſked if her mother too was living, both his diſtreſs and his aſſurances confirmed the relations made by Bianchi.</p>
                     <p>When Ellena's mind became more tranquil ſhe noticed again the ſingularity of Schedoni's viſit to her apartment at ſo ſacred an hour; and her thoughts glanced back involuntarily to the ſcene of the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evening on the ſea-ſhore, and the image of her father appeared in each, in the terrific character of an agent of the Marcheſa di Vivaldi. The ſuſpicions, however, which ſhe had formerly admitted, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his deſigns, were now impatiently rejected, for ſhe was leſs anxious to diſcover truth, than to releaſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from horrible ſuppoſitions; and ſhe willingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that Schedoni having miſunderſtood her charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, had only deſigned to aſſiſt in removing her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of Vivaldi—The ingenuity of hope ſuggeſted alſo, that, having juſt heard from her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducters, or from Spalatro, ſome circumſtances of her ſtory, he had been led to a ſuſpicion of the relationſhip between them, and that in the firſt impatience of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental anxiety, he had diſregarded the hour and come, though at midnight, to her apartment to aſcertain the truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="unknown:032735_0342_0FF496A95EA71778"/>
While ſhe ſoothed herſelf with this explanation of a circumſtance, which had occaſioned her conſiderable ſurpriſe, ſhe perceived on the floor the point of a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger peeping from beneath the curtains! Emotions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt too horrible to be ſuſtained, followed this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; ſhe took the inſtrument, and gazed upon it aghaſt, and trembling; for a ſuſpicion of the real motive of Schedoni's viſit glanced upon her mind. But it was only for a moment; ſuch a ſuppoſition was too terrible to be willingly endured; ſhe again believed that Spalatro alone had meditated her deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction, and ſhe thanked the Confeſſor as her deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erer, inſtead of ſhrinking from him as an aſſaſſin. She now underſtood that Schedoni, having diſcovered the ruffian's deſign, had ruſhed into the chamber to ſave a ſtranger from his murderous poignard, and had unconſcionſlly reſcued his own daughter, when the portrait at her boſom informed him of the truth. With this conviction, Ellena's eyes overflowed with gratitude, and her heart was huſhed to peace.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni, meanwhile, ſhut up in his chamber, was agitated by feelings of a very oppoſite nature. When their firſt exceſs was exhauſted, and his mind was calm enough to reflect, the images that appeared on it ſtruck him with ſolemn wonder. In purſuing Ellena as the criminal inſtigation of the Marcheſa di Vivaldi, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared that he had been perſecuting his own child; and in thus conſenting to conſpire againſt the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, he had, in the event, been only puniſhing the guilty, and preparing mortification for himſelf on the exact ſubject to which he had ſacrificed his conſcience. Every ſtep that he had taken, with a view of gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ambition was r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

An alliance with the illuſtrious houſe of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:032735_0343_0FF497045D3C4C78"/>
was above his loftieſt hope of advancement, and this event he had himſelf nearly prevented by the very means which had been adopted, at the expence of every virtuous conſideration, to obtain an inferior promotion. Thus, by a ſingular retribution, his own crimes had recoiled upon himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni perceived the many obſtacles, which lay between him and his newly-awakened hopes, and that much was to be overcome before thoſe nuptials could be publicly ſolemnized, which he was now ſtill more anxious to promote, then he had lately been to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. The approbation of the Marcheſa was, at leaſt, deſirable, for ſhe had much at her diſpoſal, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, though his daughter might be the wife of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, he himſelf would be no otherwiſe benefited at preſent than by the honour of the connection. He had ſome peculiar reaſons for believing, that her conſent might be obtained, and, though there was hazard in delaying the nuptials till ſuch an experiment had been made, he reſolved to encounter it, rather than forbear to ſolicit her concurrence. But, if the Marcheſa ſhould prove inexorable, he determined to beſtow the hand of Ellena, without her knowledge; and in doing ſo he well knew that he incurred little danger from her reſentment, ſince he had ſecrets in his poſſeſſion, the conſciouſneſs of which muſt awe her into a ſpeedy neutrality. The conſent of the Marcheſe, as he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired of obtaining it, he did not mean to ſolicit, and the influence of the Marcheſa was ſuch, that Schedoni did not regard that as eſſential.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ſteps, however, to be taken, were thoſe that might releaſe Vivaldi from the Inquiſition, the tremendous priſon into which Schedoni himſelf, little foreſeeing that he ſhould ſo ſoon wiſh for his liberation, had cauſed him to be thrown. He had always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, indeed, that if the Informer forbore to appear againſt the Accuſed in this Court, the latter would
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:032735_0344_0FF496B4E6ADC390"/>
of courſe, be liberated, and he alſo believed, that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi's freedom could be obtained whenever be ſhould think proper to apply to a perſon at Naples, whom he knew to be connected with the <hi>Holy Office</hi> of Rome. How much the Confeſſor had ſuffered his wiſhes to deceive him, may appear hereafter. His motives for having thus confined Vivaldi, were partly thoſe of ſelf-defence. He dreaded the diſcovery and the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, which might follow the loſs of Ellena, ſhould Vivaldi be at liberty immediately to purſue his enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. But he believed that all trace of her muſt be loft, after a few weeks had elapſed, and that Vivaldi's ſufferings, from confinement in the Inquiſition, would have given intereſts to his mind, which muſt weaken the one he left for Ellena. Yet, though in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſelf-defence had been a principal motive with Schedoni, a deſire of revenging the inſult he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the church of the Spirito Santo, and all the conſequent mortifications he experienced had been a ſecond; and, ſuch was the blackneſs of this hatred, and the avarice of his revenge, that he had not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the ſuffering, which the loſs of Ellena would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion Vivaldi, as ſufficient retaliation.</p>
                     <p>In adopting a mode of puniſhment ſo extraordinary as that of impriſonment in the Inquiſiton, it appears, therefore, that Schedoni was influenced, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>partly by the difficulty of otherwiſe confining Vivaldi, during the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of which confinement was abſolutely neceſſary to the ſucceſs of his own ſchemes, and partly by a deſire of inflicting the tortures of terror. He had alſo been encouraged by his diſcovery of this opportunity for conferring new obligations on the Marcheſa. The very conduct, that muſt have appeared to the firſt glance of an honeſt mind fatal to his intereſts, he thought might be rendered beneficial to them, and that his dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity could ſo command the buſineſs, as that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa ſhould eventually thank him as the deliverer of
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:032735_0345_0FF5850686DC0EC8"/>
her ſon, inſtead of diſcovering and execrating him as his Accuſer; a ſcheme favoured by the unjuſt and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el rule enacted by the tribunal he approached, which permitted anonymous Informers.</p>
                     <p>To procure the arreſtation of Vivaldi, it had been only neceſſary to ſend a written accuſation, without a name, to the <hi>Holy Office,</hi> with a mention of the place where the accuſed perſon migh be ſeized; but the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, in conſequence of this, did not always proceed further than the <hi>queſtion;</hi> ſince, if the Informer failed to diſcover himſelf to the inquiſitors, the priſoner after many examinations, was releaſed, unleſs he happened unwarily to criminate himſelf. Schedoni, as he did not intend to proſecute, believed, therefore, that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi would, of courſe, be diſcharged after a certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, and ſuppoſing it alſo utterly impoſſible that he could ever diſcover his Accuſer, the Confeſſor deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to appear anxious and active in effecting his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe. This character of a deliverer, he knew he ſhould be the better enabled to ſupport by means of a perſon officially connected with the <hi>Holy Office,</hi> who had already unconſciouſly aſſiſted his views. In the apartment of this man, Schedoni had accidently ſeen a formula of arreſtation againſt a perſon ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Hereſy, the view of which had not only ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him the plan he had ſince adopted, but had, in ſome degree, aſſiſted him to carry it into effect. He had ſeen the ſcroll only for a ſhort time, but his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations were ſo minute, and his memory ſo clear, that he was able to copy it with at leaſt ſufficient exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to impoſe upon the Benedictine prieſt, who had, perhaps, ſeldom, or never ſeen a real inſtrument of this kind, Schedoni had employed this artifice for the purpoſe of immediately ſecuring Vivaldi, apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, while the Inquiſitors were ſlowly delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon his arreſt, he might quit Celano, and elude diſcovery. If the deception ſucceeded, it would ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:032735_0346_0FF496B66E95E358"/>
him alſo to ſeize Ellena, and to miſlead Vivaldi reſpecting her deſtination. The charge of having carried off a nun, might appear to be corroborated by many circumſtances, and Schedoni would probably have made theſe the ſubject of real denunciation, had he not forſeen the danger and the trouble in which it might implicate himſelf; and that, as the charge could not be ſubſtantiated, Ellena would finally eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape. As far as his plan ow went, it had been ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful; ſome of the bravoes whom he hired to perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate officiels, had conveyed Vivaldi to the town, when the real officers of the Inquiſition were appointed to receive him; while the others carried Ellena to the ſhore of the Adriatic. Schedoni had much applauded his own ingenuity, in thus contriving, by the matter of the forged accuſation, to throw an impenetrable veil over the fate of Ellena, and to ſecure himſelf from the ſuſpicions or vengeance of Vivaldi, who, it appeared, would always believe that ſhe had died, or was ſtill confined in the unſearchable priſons of the Inquiſition.</p>
                     <p>Thus he had betrayed himſelf in endeavouring to betray Vivaldi, whoſe releaſe, however, he yet ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed could be eaſily obtained; but how much his policy had, in this inſtance, outrun his ſagacity, now remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be proved.</p>
                     <p>The ſubject of Schedoni's immediate perplexity, was the difficulty of conveying Ellena back to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; ſince, not chuſing to appear, at preſent, in the character of her father, he could not decorouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her thither himſelf, nor could he prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entruſt her to the conduct of any perſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> he knew in this neighbourhood. It was, however, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to form a ſpeedy determination, for he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endure to paſs another day in a ſcene which muſt continually impreſs him with the horrors of the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing night, nor that Ellena ſhould remain in it; and the morning-light already gleamed upon his caſements.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="unknown:032735_0347_0FF4970D6B1E5868"/>
After ſome further deliberation, he reſolved to be himſelf her conductor, as far, at leaſt, as through the foreſts of the Garganus, and at the firſt town where conveniencies could be procured, to throw aſide his Monk's habit, and, aſſuming the dreſs of a layman, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her in this diſguiſe towards Naples, till he ſhould either diſcover ſome ſecure means of ſending her forward to that city, or a temporary aſylum for her in a convent on the way.</p>
                     <p>His mind was ſcarcely more tranquil, after having formed this determination, than before, and he did not attempt to repoſe himſelf even for a moment. The circumſtances of the late diſcovery were almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually recurring to his affrighted conſcience, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by a fear that Ellena might ſuſpect the real purpoſe of his midnight viſit; and he alternately form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and rejected plauſible falſehoods, that might aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuage her curioſity, and delude her apprehenſion.</p>
                     <p>The hour arrived, however, when it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to prepare for departure, and found him ſtill unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided as to the explanation he ſhould form.</p>
                     <p>Having releaſed Spalatro from his chamber, and given him directions to procure horſes and a guide immediately from the neighbouring hamlet, he repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Ellena's room, to prepare her for this haſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval. On approaching it, a remembrance of the purpoſe, with which he had laſt paſſed through theſe ſame paſſages and ſtaircaſe, appealed ſo powerfully to his feelings, that he was unable to proceed, and he turned back to his own apartment to recover ſome command over himſelf. A few moments reſtored to him his uſual addreſs, though not his tranquillity, and he again approached the chamber; it was now, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>er by way of the corridor. As he unbarred the door, his hand trembled; but, when he entered the room, his countenance and manner had reſumed their uſual ſolemnity, and his voice only would have betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:032735_0348_0FF496B7F77E3128"/>
to an attentive obſerver, the agitation of his mind.</p>
                     <p>Ellena was conſiderably affected on ſeeing him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and he examined with a jealous eye the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he witneſſed. The ſmile with which ſhe met him was tender, but he perceived it paſs away from her features, like the aerial colouring that illumines a mountain's brow; and the gloom of doubt and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion again overſpread them. As he advanced, he held forth his hand for her's, when ſuddenly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the dagger he had left in the chamber, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily withdrew his proffered courteſy, and his countenance changed. Ellena, whoſe eyes followed his to the object that attracted them, pointed to the inſtrument, took it up, and approached him, ſaid, "This dagger I found laſt night in my chamber! O my father!"—</p>
                     <p>"That dagger!" ſaid Schedoni, with affected ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.</p>
                     <p>"Examine it," continued Ellena, while ſhe held it up, "Do you know to whom it belongs? and who brought it hither?"</p>
                     <p>"What is it you mean?" aſked Schedoni, betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his feelings.</p>
                     <p>"Do you know, too, for what purpoſe it was brought?" ſaid Ellena mournfully.</p>
                     <p>The Confeſſor made no reply, but irreſolutely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſeize the inſtrument.</p>
                     <p>"O yes, I perceive you know too well," continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ellena, "here, my father, while I ſlept."—</p>
                     <p>"Give me the dagger," interrupted Schedoni, in a frightful voice.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, my father, I will give it as an offering of my gratitude," replied Ellena, but as ſhe raiſed her eyes, filled with tears, his look and fixed attitude ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified her, and ſhe added with a ſtill more perſuaſive tenderneſs, "Will you not accept the offering of your child, for having preſerved her from the poignard of an aſſaſſin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="unknown:032735_0349_0FF4970EF2B5C408"/>
Schedoni's looks became yet darker; he took the dagger in ſilence, and threw it with violence to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt end of the chamber, while his eyes remained fixed on her's. The force of the action alarmed her; "Yes, it is in vain that you would conceal the truth," ſhe added, weeping unreſtrainedly, "your goodneſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avail; I know the whole."—</p>
                     <p>The laſt words arouſed Schedoni again from his trance, his features became convulſed, and his look fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. "What do you know?" he demanded in a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due voice, that ſeemed ready to burſt in thunder.</p>
                     <p>"All that I owe you," replied Ellena, that laſt night, while I ſlept upon this mattreſs, unſuſpicious of what was deſigned againſt me, an aſſaſſin entered the chamber with that inſtrument in his hand, and—"</p>
                     <p>A ſtifled groan from Schedoni checked Ellena; ſhe obſerved his rolling eyes, and trembled; till be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that his agitation was occaſioned by indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the aſſaſſin, ſhe reſumed, "Why ſhould you think it neceſſary to conceal the danger which has threatened me, ſince it is to you that I owe my deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence from it? O! my father, do not deny me the pleaſure of ſhedding theſe tears of gratitude, do not refuſe the thanks which are due to you!

                     <p>Schedoni's paſſions were changed, but they were not leſs violent; he could ſcarcely controul them, while he ſaid, in a tremulous tone—" It is enough, ſay no more; and he raiſed Ellena, but turned away without embracing her.</p>
                     <p>His ſtrong emotion, as he paced in ſilence, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt end of the apartment, excited her ſurpriſe, but ſhe then attributed it to a remembrance of the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous moment, from which he had reſcued her.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni, meanwhile, to whom her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

daggers, was trying to ſubdue the feelings of remorſe that tore his heart; and was ſo enveloped in a world of his own, as to be for ſome time unconcious of all around him. He continued to ſtalk in gloomy ſilence along the chamber, till the voice of Ellena, entreating him rather to rejoice that he had been permitted to ſave her than ſo deeply to conſider dangers which were paſt, again touched the cord that vibrated to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and recalled him to a ſenſe of his ſituation. He then bid her prepare for immediate departure, and abruptly quitted the room.</p>
                     <p>Vainly hoping that in flying from the ſcene of his mediated crime, he ſhould leave with it the acuteneſs of remembrance, and the agonizing ſtings of remorſe, he was now more anxious than ever to leave this place. Yet he ſhould ſtill be accompanied by Ellena, and her innocent looks, her affectionate thanks, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted an anguiſh which was ſcarcely endurable. Sometimes, thinking that her hatred, or what to him would be ſtill ſeverer, her contempt, muſt be more tolerable than this gratitude, he almoſt reſolved to undeceive her reſpecting his conduct, but as conſtantly and impatiently repelled the thought with horror, and finally determined to ſuffer her to account for his late extraordinary viſit in the away ſhe had choſen.</p>
                     <p>Spalatro, at length, returned from the hamlet with horſes, but without having procured a guide to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the travellers through a tract of the long-devolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foreſts of the Garganus, which it was neceſſary for them to paſs.

had no apprehenſion, though he too well underſtood, the villainy of his propoſed companion; for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that he himſelf ſhould be well armed, and he determined to aſcertain that Spalatro was without weapons, he knew, alſo, that in caſe of a conteſt, his own ſuperior ſtature would eaſily enable him to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch an antagoniſt.</p>
                     <p>Every thing being now ready for departure, Ellena was ſummoned, and the Confeſſor led her to his own apartment, where a ſlight breakfaſt was prepared.</p>
                     <p>Her ſpirits being revived by the ſpeed of this depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhe would again have expreſſed her thanks, but he peremptorily interrupted her, and forbade any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mention of gratitude.</p>
                     <p>On entering the court where the horſes were in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perceiving Spalatro, Ellena ſhrunk and put her arm within Schedoni's for protection. "What recollections does the preſence of that man revive!" ſaid ſhe, "I can ſcarcely venture to believe myſelf ſafe, even with you, when he is here."</p>
                     <p>Schedoni made no reply, till the remark was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, "You have nothing to fear from him," mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Confeſſor, while he haſtened her forward, "and we have no time to loſe in vague apprehenſion."</p>
                     <p>"How?" exclaimed Ellena, "is not he the aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin from whom you ſaved me? I cannot doubt, that you know him to be ſuch, though you would ſpare me the pain of believing ſo."</p>
                     <p>"Well, well, be it ſo," replied the Confeſſor; "Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latro lead the horſes this way."</p>
                     <p>The party were ſoon mounted, when, quitting this eventful manſion, and the ſhore of the Adriatic, as Ellena hoped for ever, they entered upon the gloomy wilderneſs of the Garganus. She often turned her eyes back upon the houſe with emotions of inexpreſſible awe, aſtoniſhment, and thankfulneſs, and gazed while a glimpſe of its turretted walls could be caught beyond

Schedoni, meanwhile, loſt in thought, broke not, by a ſingle word, the deep ſilence of the ſolitudes through which they paſſed. Spalatro was equally mute and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually engaged by his reflections on the ſudden change in Schedoni's purpoſe, and by wonder as to the motive, which could have induced him to lead Ellena in ſafety, from the very ſpot whither ſhe was brought by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command to be deſtroyed. He, however, was not ſo wholly occupied, as to be unmindful of his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, or unwatchful of an opportunity of ſerving his own intereſts, and retaliating upon Schedoni for the treatment he had received on the preceding night.</p>
                     <p>Among the various ſubjects that diſtracted the Confeſſor, the difficulty of diſpoſing of Ellena, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out betraying at Naples that ſhe was his relative, was not the leaſt diſtreſſing. Whatever might be the reaſon which could juſtify ſuch feelings, his fears of a premature diſcovery of the circumſtance to the ſociety with whom he lived, were ſo ſtrong, as often to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the moſt violent effect upon his countenance, and it was, perhaps, when he was occupied by this ſubject, that its terrific expreſſion revived with Ellena the late ſcence upon the ſhore. His embarraſſment was not leſs, as to the excuſe to be offered the Marcheſa, for having failed to fulfil his engagement, and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the means by which he might intereſt her in favour of Ellena, and even diſpoſe her to approve the marriage, before ſhe ſhould be informed of the family of this unfortunate young woman. Perceiving all the neceſſity for aſcertaining the probabilities of ſuc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> conſent, before he ventured to make an avowal of her origin, he determined not to reveal himſelf till he ſhould be perfectly ſure that the diſcovery would be acceptable to the Marcheſa. In the mean time, as it would be neceſſary to ſay ſomething of Ellena's birth, he meant to declare, that he had diſcovered it to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and her family worthy in every reſpect, of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with that of the Vivaldi,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="unknown:032735_0354_0FF496C54E6D5FE8"/>
An interview with the Marcheſa, was almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually wiſhed for and dreaded by the Confeſſor. He ſhuddered at the expectation of meeting a woman, who had inſtigated him to the murder of his own child, which though he had been happily prevented from committing it, was an act that would ſtill be wiſhed for by the Marcheſa. How could he endure her reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, when we ſhould diſcover that he had failed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh her will! How conceal the indignation of a father, and diſſimulated all a father's various feelings, when, in reply to ſuch reproaches, he muſt form ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, and act humility, from which his whole ſoul would revolt! Never could his arts of diſſimulation have been ſo ſeverely tried, not, even in the late ſcenes with Ellena, never have returned upon himſelf in puniſhment ſo ſevere, as in that which awaited him with the Marcheſa. And from its approach the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> and politic Schedoni often ſhrunk in ſuch horror, that he almoſt determined to avoid it at any hazard, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to unite Vivaldi and Ellena, without even ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing the conſent of the Marcheſa.</p>
                     <p>A deſire, however, of the immediate preferment ſo neceſſary to his pride, conſtantly checked this ſcheme, and finally made him willing to ſubject every honeſt feeling, and ſubmit to any meanneſs, however, vicious, rather than forego the favourite object of his errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ambition. Never, perhaps, was the paradoxical union of pride and abjectneſs, more ſtrongly exibited than on this occaſion.</p>
                     <p>While thus the travellers ſilently proceeded, Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's thoughts often turned to Vivaldi, and ſhe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, with trembling anxiety, the effect which the late diſcovery was likely to have upon their future lives. It appeared to her, that Schedoni muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of a connection thus flattering to the pride of a father, though he would probably refuſe his, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to a private marriage. And, when ſhe further
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:032735_0355_0FF4971CC67FF890"/>
conſidered the revolution, which a knowledge of her family might occaſion towards herſelf in the minds of the Vivaldi, her proſpects ſeemed to brighten, and her cares began to diſſipate. Judging that Schedoni muſt be acquainted with the preſent ſituation of Vivaldi ſhe was continually on the point of mentioning him, but was as conſtantly reſtrained by timidity, though, had ſhe ſuſpected him to be an inhabitant of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, her ſcruples would have vaniſhed before an irreſiſtable intereſt. As it was, believing that he like herſelf, had been impoſed upon by the Marcheſa's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, in the diſguiſe of officials, ſhe concluded, as has before appeared, that he now ſuffered a temporary impriſonment by order of his mother, at one of the family vilas. When, however, Schedoni awaking from his reverie, abruptly mentioned Vivaldi, her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits fluttered with impatience to learn his exact ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and ſhe enquired reſpecting it.</p>
                     <p>"Im no ſtranger to your attachment," ſaid Schedoni, evading the queſtion, "but I wiſh to be informed of ſome circumſtances relative to its commencement."</p>
                     <p>Ellena, confuſed, and not knowing what to reply, was for a moment ſilent, and then repeated her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
                     <p>"Where did you firſt meet?" ſaid the Confeſſor, ſtill diſregarding her queſtion. Ellena related, that ſhe had firſt ſeen Vivaldi, when attending her aunt from the church of San Lorenzo. For the preſent ſhe was ſpared the embarraſſment of further explanation by Spalatro, who riding up to Schedoni, informed him they were approaching the town of Zanti. On look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foward, Ellena perceived houſes peeping from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the foreſt-trees, at a ſhort diſtance, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard the cheerful bark of a dog, that ſure herald and faithful ſervant of man!</p>
                     <p>Soon after the travellers entered Zanti, a ſmall town ſurrounded by the foreſt, where, however, the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:032735_0356_0FF496C6D756D698"/>
poverty of the inhabitants ſeemed to forbid a longer ſtay than was abſolutely neceſſary for repoſe, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſlight refreſhment. Spalatro led the way to a cabin, in which the few perſons, that journied this road were uſually entertained. The appearance of the people, who owned it, was as wild as their country, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior of the dwelling was ſo dirty and comfortleſs, that Schedoni, preferring to take his repaſt in the open air, a table was ſpread under the luxuriant ſhade of the foreſt-trees, at a little diſtance. Here, when the hoſt had withdrawn, and Spalatro had been diſpatched to examine the poſt-horſes, and to procure a lay-habit for the Confeſſor, the latter, once more alone with Ellena, began to experience again ſomewhat of the embarraſſments of conſcience; and Ellena, whenever her eyes glanced upon him, ſuffered a ſolemnity of fear that roſe almoſt to terror. He, at length, termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated this emphatic ſilence, by renewing his mention of Vivaldi, and his command that Ellena ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the hiſtory of their affection. Not daring to refuſe, ſhe obeyed, but with as much brevity as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and Schedoni did not interrupt her by a ſingle obſervation. However eligible their nuptials now appeared to him, he forebore to give any hint of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, till he ſhould have extricated the object of her regards from his perilous ſituation. But, with Ellena, this very ſilence implied the opinion it was meant to conceal, and, encouraged by the hope it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, ſhe ventured once more to aſk, by whoſe order Vivaldi had been arreſted; whither he had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, and the circumſtance of his preſent ſituation.</p>
                     <p>Too politic to intruſt her with a knowledge of his actual condition, the Confeſſor ſpared her the anguiſh of learning that he was a priſoner in the Inquiſition. He affected ignorance of the late tranſaction at Celano, but ventured to believe, that both Vivaldi and herſelf had been arreſted by order of the Marcheſa, who, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

conjectured, had thrown him into temporary confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a meaſure which ſhe, no doubt, had meant to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force alſo towards Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"And you, my father," obſerved Ellena, "what brought you to my priſon,—you who was not inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Marcheſa's deſigns?—What accident conducted you to that remote ſolitude, juſt at the moment when you could ſave your child!"</p>

I know too well that her plan was more atrocious, and ſince you had too much reaſon to know this, why do you ſay that impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment only was intended for me? But your ſolicitude for my tranquillity leads you to?"—</p>
                     <p>"What means," interrupted the ſuſpicious Schedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, "can I particularly have of underſtanding the Marcheſa's ſchemes?

                     <p>"Did you not ſave me from the arm of the aſſaſſin!" ſaid Ellena tenderly; "did not you wrench the very dagger from his graſp!"</p>
                     <p>"I had forgotten, I had forgotten," ſaid the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, yet more embarraſſed.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, good minds are ever thus apt to forget the benefits they confer," replied Ellena. "But you ſhall find, my father, that a greatful heart is equally tenacious to remember them; it is the indelible regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of every act that is diſmiſſed from the memory of the benefactor."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="unknown:032735_0358_0FF496C85D7B41A8"/>
"Mention no more of benefits." ſaid Schedoni, impatiently; "let ſilence on this ſubject henceforth indicate your wiſh to oblige me."</p>
                     <p>He r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Schedoni wiſhed to diſmiſs Spalatro as ſoon as poſſible, and he enquired for a guide to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him through that part of the foreſt, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to be traverſed. In this poor town, a perſon willing to undertake that office was eaſily to be found, but the hoſt went inqueſt of a neighbour whom he had recommended.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile Spalatro returned, without having ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his commiſſion. Not any lay-habit could be procured, upon ſo ſhort a notice, that ſuited Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni. He was obliged, therefore, to continue his journey to the next town at leaſt, in his own dreſs, but the neceſſity was not very ſerious to him, ſince it was improbable that he ſhould be known in this obſcure region.</p>
                     <p>Preſently the hoſt appeared with his neighbour, when Schedoni, having received ſatisfactory anſwers to his queſtions, engaged him for the remainder of the foreſt-road and diſmiſſed Spalatro, The ruffian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with ſullen reluctance and evident ill will, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which the Confeſſor ſcarcely noticed, while occupied by the ſatisfaction of eſcaping from the preſence of the atrocious partner of his conſcience. But Ellena, as he paſſed her, obſerved the maligant diſappointment of his look, and it ſerved only to heighten the thankfulneſs his departure occaſioned her.</p>
                     <p>It was ofternoon before the travellers proceeded. Schedoni had calculated that they could eaſily reach the town, at which they deſigned to paſs the night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the cloſe of evening, and he had been in no haſte to depart during the heat of the day. Their track now lay through a country leſs ſavage, though ſcarcely leſs wild than that they had paſſed in the morning.

The grandeur of the trees, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, did not decline; the plane, the oak, and the cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut ſtill threw a pomp of foliage round theſe ſmiling ſpots, and ſeemed to conſecrate the mountain ſtreams, that deſcended beneath their ſolemn ſhade.</p>
                     <p>To the harraſſed ſpirits of Ellena the changing ſcenery was refreſhing and ſhe frequently yielded her cares to the influence of majeſtic nature. Over the gloom of Schedoni, no ſcenery had, at any moment, power; the ſhape and paint of external imagery gave neither impreſſion nor colour to his fancy. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned the ſweet illuſions, to which other ſpirits are liable, and which often confer a delight more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and not leſs innocent, than any, which delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive reaſon can beſtow.</p>
                     <p>The ſame thoughtful ſilence, that had wrapt him at the beginning of the journey, he ſtill preſerved, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when occaſionally he aſked a queſtion of the guide concerning the way, and received anſwers too loqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious for his humour. This loquacity, however, was not eaſily oppreſſed, and the peaſant had already begun to relate ſome terrible ſtories of murder, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in theſe foreſts upon people, who had been har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy enough to venture into them without a guide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the again abſtracted Schedoni even noticed that he ſpoke.

The
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:032735_0360_0FF496D329C4B7F0"/>
ſtilneſs was not leſs effectual than the gloom, for no ſounds were heard, except ſuch as ſeemed to charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erize ſolitude, and impreſs its awful power more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the heart,—the hollow daſhing of torrents deſcending diſtantly, and the deep ſighings of the wind, as it paſſed among trees, which threw their broad arms over the cliffs, and crowned the higheſt ſummits. Onward, through the narrowing winding of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file, no living object appeared; but, as Ellena looked fearfully back, ſhe thought ſhe diſtinguiſhed a human figure, advancing beneath the duſky umbrage that cloſed the view. She communicated her ſuſpicion to Schedoni, though not her fears, and they ſtopped for a moment, to obſerve further. The object advanced ſlowly, and they perceived the ſtature of a man, who, having continued to approach, ſuddenly pauſed, and then glided away behind the fol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>age that croſſed the perſpective, but not before Ellena fancied ſhe diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated the figure of Spalatro. None but a purpoſe the moſt deſperate, ſhe believed, could have urged him to follow into this, inſtead of returning, as he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, to his home. Yet it appeared improbable, that he alone ſhould be willing to attack two armed perſons, for both Schedoni and the guide had weapons of defence. This conſideration afforded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her only a momentary reſpite from apprehenſion, ſince it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that he might not be alone, though only one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had yet been ſeen among the ſhrouding branches of the woods. "Did you not think he reſembled Spalatro?" ſaid Ellena to the Confeſſor, "was he not of the ſame ſtature and air? You are well armed, or I ſhould fear for you, as well as for myſelf."</p>
                     <p>"I did not obſerve a reſemblance," replied Schedoni, throwing a glance back, "but whoever he is, you have nothing to apprehend from him, for he has diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Signor, ſo much the worſe," obſerved the
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:032735_0361_0FF4972160076AC8"/>
guide, "ſo much the worſe, if he means us any harm, for he can ſteal along the rocks behind theſe thickets, and ſtrike out upon us before we are aware of him. Or, if he knows the path that runs among thoſe old oaks yonder, on the left where the ground riſes, he has us ſure at the turning of the next cliff."</p>
                     <p>"Speak lower," ſaid Schedoni, "unleſs you mean that he ſhould benefit by your inſtructions."</p>
                     <p>Though the Confeſſor ſaid this without any ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of evil intention from the guide, the man imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately began to juſtify himſelf, and added, "I'll give him a hint of what he may expect, however, if he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks us." As he ſpoke, he fired his trombone in the air, when every rock reverberated the ſound, and the faint and fainter thunder retired in murmurs through all the windings of the defile. The eagerneſs, with which the guide had juſtified himſelf, produced an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon Schedoni contrary to what he deſigned; and the Confeſſor, as he watched him ſuſpiciouſly obſerved, that after he had fired, he did not load his peace again. "Since you have given the enemy ſufficient intimation where to find us," ſaid Schedoni, "you will do well to prepare for his reception; load again, friend. I have arms too, and they are ready."</p>
                     <p>While the man ſullenly obeyed, Ellena, again alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, looked back in ſearch of the ſtranger, but not any perſon appeared beneath the gloom, and no foot-ſtep broke upon the ſtilneſs. When, however, ſhe ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard a ruſtling noiſe, ſhe looked to the bordering thickets, almoſt expecting to ſee Spalatro break from among them, before ſhe perceived that it was only the ſounding pinions of birds, which, ſtartled by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the trombone from their high neſts in the cliffs, winged their way from danger.</p>
                     <p>The ſuſpicions of the Confeſſor had, probably, been ſlight, for they were tranſient; and when Ellena next addreſſed him, he had again retired within himſelf.
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:032735_0362_0FF496D4B2999918"/>
He was ruminating upon an excuſe to be offered the Marcheſa, which might be ſufficient both to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuage her diſappointment and baffle her curioſity, and he could not, at preſent, fabricate one that might ſoothe her reſentment without riſk of betraying his ſecret.</p>
                     <p>Twilight had added its gloom to that ſtate of the rocks, before the travellers diſtinguiſhed the town, at which they meant to paſs the night. It terminated the defile, and its grey houſes could ſcarely be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the precipice upon which they hung, or from the trees that emboſomed them. A rapid ſtream roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed below, and over it a bridge conducted the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the little inn, at which they were to take up their abode. Here, quietly lodged, Ellena diſmiſſed all preſent apprehenſion of Spalatro, but ſhe ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved ſhe had ſeen him and her ſuſpicions, as to the motive of his extraordinary journey, were not appeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>As this was a town of ampler accommodation than the one they had left, Schedoni eaſily procured a lay-habit, that would diſguiſe him for the remainder of the journey; and Ellena was permitted to lay aſide the nun's veil, for one of a more general faſhion; but, in diſmiſſing it, ſhe did not forget that it had been the veil of Olivia, and ſhe preſerved it as a ſacred relique of her favourite recluſe.</p>
                     <p>The diſtance between this town and Naples was ſtill that of ſeveral days journey, according to the uſual mode of travelling; but the moſt dangerous part of the way was now overcome, the road having emerged from the foreſts; and when Schedoni, on the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing morning was departing, he would have diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the guide, had not the hoſt aſſured him, he would find one ſtill nceſſary in the open, but wild, country through which he muſt paſs. Schedoni's diſtruſt of this guide had never been very ſerious, and, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of the preceding evening proved favourable, he
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:032735_0363_0FF4972C1BFBB628"/>
had reſtored him ſo entirely to his confidence, as will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to engage him for the preſent day. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, however, Ellena did not perfectly coincide; ſhe had obſerved the man while he loaded the trombone on Schedoni's order, and his evident reluctance had almoſt perſuaded her, that he was in league with ſome perſon who deſigned to attack them; a conjecture, perhaps, the more readily admitted while her mind was ſuffering from the impreſſion of having ſeen Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latro. She now ventured to hint her diſtruſt to the Confeſſor, who paid little attention to it, and remind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, that ſufficient proof of the man's honeſty had appeared, in their having been permitted to paſs in ſafety, a defile ſo convenient for the purpoſe of rapine as that of yeſterday. To a reply apparently ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, Ellena could oppoſe nothing, had ſhe even dared to preſs the topic; and ſhe re-commenced the journey with gayer hopes.</p>

                     <p>ON this day, Schedoni was more communicative than on the preceding one. While they rode apart from the guide, he converſed with Ellena on va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious topics relative to herſelf, but without once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding to Vivaldi; and even condeſcended to mention his deſign of diſpoſing of her in a convent at ſome diſtance from Naples, till it ſhould be convenient for him to acknowledge her for his daughter. But the difficulty of finding a ſuitable ſituation embarraſſed him, and he was diſconcerted by the aukwardneſs of introducing her himſelf to ſtrangers, whoſe curioſity would be heightened by a ſenſe of their intereſt.</p>
                     <p>Theſe circumſtances induced him the more eaſily to attend to the diſtreſs of Ellena, on her learning, that ſhe was again to be placed at a diſtance from her home, and among ſtrangers; and the more willingly to liſten to the account ſhe gave of the convent of Santa Maria della Pieta, and to her requeſt of returning thither. But in whatever-degree he might be inclined to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, he liſtened without conſenting, and Ellena had only the conſolation of perceiving that he was not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely determined to adopt his firſt plan.</p>
                     <p>Her thoughts were too deeply engaged upon her fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proſpects to permit leiſure for preſent fears, or probably ſhe would have ſuffered ſome return of thoſe of yeſterday, in traverſing the lonely plains and rude vallies, through which the road lay. Schedoni was thankful to the landlord, who had adviſed him to keep
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:032735_0365_0FF4972DAB58DCE0"/>
the guide, the road being frequently obſcured amongſt the wild heaths that ſtretched around, and the eye often ſweeping over long tracts of country, without perceiving a villiage or any human dwelling.—Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole morning, they had not met one travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and they continued to proceed beneath the heat of noon, becauſe Schedoni had been unable to diſcover even a cottage, in which ſhelter and repoſe might be obtained,</p>
                     <p>It was late in the day when the guide pointed out the grey walls of an edifice which crowned the acclivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they were approaching. But this was ſo ſhrouded among woods, than no feature of it could be diſtinctly ſeen, and it did but ſlightly awaken their hopes of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching a convent, which might receive them with hoſpitality.</p>
                     <p>The high banks overſhadowed with thickets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which the road aſcended, ſoon excluded even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> glimpſe of the walls, but, as the travellers turned the next projection, they perceived a perſon on the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of the road, croſſing as if towards ſome place of reſidence, and concluded that the edifice they had ſeen was behind the trees, among which he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared.</p>
                     <p>A few moments brought them to the ſpot, where, retired at a ſhort diſtance mong the woods that brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hill, they diſcovered the extenſive remains of what ſeemed to have been a villa, and which, from the air of deſolation it exhibited, Schedoni would have judged to be wholly deſerted, had he not already ſeen a perſon enter. Wearied and exhauſted, he determined to aſcertain whether any refreſhment could be procured from the inhabitants within, and the party alighted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the portal of a deep and broad avenue of arched ſtone, which ſeemed to have been the grand approach to the villa. The entrance was obſtructed by fallen fragments of columns, and by the underwood that had
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:032735_0366_0FF496D7C1A46130"/>
taken root amongſt them. The travellers, however, eaſily overcame theſe interruptions: but as the avenue was of conſiderable extent, and as its only light pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the portal, except what a few narrow loops in the walls admitted, they ſoon found themſelves involved in an obſcurity that rendered the way diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and Schedoni endeavoured to make himſelf heard by the perſon he had ſeen. The effort was unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but as they proceeded, a bend in the paſſage ſhewed a diſtant glimmering of light, which ſerved to guide them to the oppoſite entrance, where an arch opened immediately into a court of the villa. Schedoni pauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here in diſappointment, for every object ſeemed to bear evidence of abandonment and deſolation; and he looked, almoſt hopeleſsly, round the light colonnade which ran along three ſides of the court, and to the trees that waved over the fourth, in ſearch of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who had been ſeen from the road. No human figure ſtole upon the vacancy; yet the apt fears of Ellena almoſt imagined the form of Spalatro gliding behind the columns, and ſhe ſtarted as the air ſhook over the wild plants that wreathed them, before ſhe diſcovered that is was not the ſound of ſteps, At the extravagance of her ſuſpicions, however, and the weakneſs of her terrors, ſhe bluſhed, and endeavoured to reſiſt that propenſity to fear, which nerves long preſſed upon had occaſioned in her mind.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni, meanwhile, ſtood in the court, like the evil ſpirit of the place, examining its deſolation, and endeavouring to aſcertain whether any perſon lurked in the interior of the building.—Several door-ways in the colonade appeared to lead in chambers of the villa, and, after a ſhort heſitation, Schedoni, having deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to purſue his enquiry, entered one of them, and paſſed through a marble hall to a ſuite of rooms, whoſe condition told how long it was ſince they had been inhabited. The roofs had entirely vaniſhed, and even
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:032735_0367_0FF4972F345523F8"/>
portions of the walls had fallen, and lay in maſſes amongſt the woods without.</p>
                     <p>Perceiving that it was as uſeleſs as difficult to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, the Confeſſor returned to the court, where the ſhade of the palmetos, at leaſt, offered an hoſpitable ſhelter to the wearied travellers. They repoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves beneath the branches, on ſome fragments of a marble fountain, whence the court opened to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive landſcape, now mellowed by the evening beams, and partook of the remains of a repaſt, which had been depoſited in the wallet of the guide.</p>
                     <p>"This place appears to have ſuffered from an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, rather than from time," ſaid Schedoni, "for the walls, though ſhattered, do not ſeem to have decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and, much that has been ſtrong, lies in ruin, while what is comparatively ſlight remains uninjured; theſe are certainly ſymptoms of partial ſhocks of the earth. Do you know any thing of the hiſtory of this place, friend?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Signor," replied the guide.</p>
                     <p>"Relate it, then,"</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall never forget the earthquake that deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it Signor; for it was felt all through the Gargan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us. I was then about ſixteen, and I remember it was near an hour before midnight that the great ſhock was felt. The weather had been almoſt ſtifling for ſeveral days, ſcarcely a breath of air had ſtirred, and ſlight tremblings of the ground were noticed by many people. I had been out all day, cutting wood in the foreſt with my father, and tired enough we were, when—"</p>
                     <p>"This is the hiſtory of yourſelf," ſaid Schedoni, interrupting him, "Who did this place belong to?"</p>
                     <p>"Did any perſon ſuffer here?" ſaid Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"The Barone di Cambruſa lived here," replied the guide,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="78" facs="unknown:032735_0368_0FF496E237A986E8"/>
"Hah! the Barone!" repeated Schedoni, and ſunk into one of his accuſtomary fits of abſtraction.</p>
                     <p>"He was a Signor little loved in the country," continued the guide, "and ſome people ſaid it was a judgment upon him for—"</p>
                     <p>"Was it not rather a judgment upon the country," interrupted the Confeſſor, lifting up his head, and then ſinking again into ſilence.</p>
                     <p>"I know not for that, Signor, but he had committed crimes enough to make one's hair ſtand on end. It was here that he—"</p>
                     <p>"Fools are always wondering at the actions of thoſe above them," ſaid Schedoni, teſtily; "Where is the Barone now.</p>
                     <p>"I cannot tell, Signor, but moſt likely where he deſerves to be, for he has never been heard of ſince the night of the earthquake, and it is believed he was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried under the ruins."</p>
                     <p>"Did any other perſon ſuffer?" repeated Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"You ſhall hear, Signora," replied the peaſant, "I happen to know ſomething about the matter, becauſe a couſin of our's lived in the family at that time, and my father has often told me all about it, as well as of the late lords goings-on. It was near midnight when the great ſhock came, and the family, thinking of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, had ſupped and been aſleep ſome time, Now it happened that the Barone's chamber was in a tower of the old building, at which people often won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derered, becauſe, ſaid they, why ſhould he chooſe to ſleep in the old part where there are ſo many fine rooms in the new villa? but ſo it was."</p>
                     <p>"Come, diſpatch your meal," ſaid Schedoni, awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his deep muſing," "the ſun is ſetting, and we have yet far to go."</p>
                     <p>"I will finiſh the meal and the ſtory together, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, with your leave," replied the guide.—Schedoni did not notice what he ſaid, and as the man was not forbidden, he proceeded with his relation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="79" facs="unknown:032735_0369_0FF49731AAEB26F0"/>
"Now it happened that the Barone's chamber was in that old tower,—if you will look this way, Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, you may ſee what is left of it."</p>
                     <p>Ellena turned her attention to where the guide pointed, and perceived the ſhattered remains of a tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er riſing beyond the arch, through which ſhe had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the court.</p>
                     <p>"You ſee that corner of a window-caſe left, in the higheſt part of the wall, Signora," continued the guide, "juſt by that tuft of aſh, that grows out of the ſtone."</p>
                     <p>"I obſerve," ſaid Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"Well, that was one of the windows of the very chamber, Signora, and you ſee ſcarcely any thing elſe is left of it. Yes, there is the door-caſe, too, but the door itſelf is gone; that little ſtair-caſe, which you ſee beyond it, led up to another ſtory, which nobody now would gueſs had ever been; for roof and flooring, and all are fallen. I wonder how that little ſtair-caſe in the corner happened to hold ſo faſt!"</p>
                     <p>"Have you almoſt done?" inquired Schedoni, who had not apparently attended to any thing the man ſaid, and now alluded to the refreſhment he was taking.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Signor, I have not a great deal more to tell, or to eat either, for that matter," replied the guide; "but you ſhall hear. Well, yonder was the very chamber, Signora, at that door-caſe, which is ſtill in the wall, the Barone came in, ah! he little thought, I warrant, that he ſhould never more go out at it! How long he had been in the room I do not know, nor whether he was a ſleep or awake, for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body that can tell; but when the great ſhock came, it ſplit the old tower at once, before any other part of the buildings. You ſee that heap of ruins, yonder, on the ground, Signora, there lie there mains of the chamber; the Barone, they ſay, was buried under them!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="80" facs="unknown:032735_0370_0FF496E3C25EA4C8"/>
Ellena ſhuddered while ſhe gazed upon this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive maſs. A groan from Schedoni ſtartled her and ſhe turnned towards him, but, as he appeared ſhrouded in meditation, ſhe again directed her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this awful memorial. As her eye paſſed upon the neighbouring arch, ſhe was ſtruck with the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of its proportions, and with its ſingular appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, now that the evening rays glanced upon the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanging ſhrubs, and darted a line of partial light ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wart the avenue beyond. But what was her emotion, when ſhe perceived a perſon gliding away in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective of the avenue, and, as he croſſed where the gleam fell, diſtinguiſhed the figure and countenance of Spalatro! She had ſcarcely power, faintly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, "Steps go there!" before he had diſappeared; and, when Schedoni looked round, the vacuity and ſilence of ſolitude every where prevailed.</p>
                     <p>Ellena now did not ſcruple poſitively to affirm that ſhe had ſeen Spalatro, and Schedoni fully ſenſible, that if her imagination had not deluded her, the purpoſe of his thus tracing their route muſt be deſperate, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately roſe, and, followed by the peaſant, paſſed into the avenue to aſcertain the truth, leaving Ellena alone in the court. He had ſcarcely diſappeared before the danger of his adventuring into that obſcure paſſage. where an aſſaſſin might ſtrike unſeen, forcibly occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Ellena, and ſhe loudly conjured him to return. She liſtened for his voice, but heard only his retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſteps; when, too anxious to remain where ſhe was, ſhe haſtened to the entrance of the avenue. But all was now huſhed; neither voice, nor ſteps were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed. Awed by the gloom of the place, ſhe feared to venture further, yet almoſt equally dreaded to remain alone in any part of the ruin, while a man ſo deſperate as Spalatro was hovering about it.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe yet liſtened at the entrance of the avenue, a faint cry, which ſeemed to iſſue from the interior of
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:032735_0371_0FF4973B02528738"/>
the villa, reached her. The firſt dreadful ſurmiſe that ſtruck Ellena was, that they were murdering her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had probably been decoyed, by another paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, back into ſome chamber of the ruin; when, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly forgetting every fear for herſelf, ſhe haſtened towards the ſpot whence ſhe judged the ſound to have iſſued. She entered the hall, which Schedoni had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, and paſſed on through a ſuit of apartments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond. Every thing here, however, was ſilent, and the place apparently deſerted. The ſuit terminated in a paſſage, that ſeemed to lead to a diſtant part of the villa, and Ellena, after a momentary heſitation, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to follow it.</p>
                     <p>She made her way with difficulty between the half-demoliſhed walls, and was obliged to attend ſo much to her ſteps, that ſhe ſcarcely noticed whither ſhe was going, till the depening ſhade of the place recalling her attention, ſhe perceived herſelf among the ruins of the tower, whoſe hiſtory had been related by the guide; and, on looking up, obſerved ſhe was at the foot of the ſtair-caſe, which ſtill wound up the wall, that had led to the chamber of the Barone.</p>
                     <p>At a moment leſs anxious, the circumſtance would have affected her; but now ſhe could only repeat her calls upon the name of Schedoni, and liſten for ſome ſignal that he was near. Still receiving no anſwer, nor hearing any further ſound of diſtreſs, ſhe began to hope that her fears had deceived her, and having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained that the paſſage terminated here, ſhe quitted the ſpot.</p>
                     <p>On regaining the firſt chamber, Ellena reſted for a moment to recover breath; and, while ſhe leaned upon what had once been a window, opening to the court, ſhe heard a diſtant report of fire-arms. The ſound ſwelled, and ſeemed to revolve along the avenue through which Schedoni had diſappeared.—Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the combatants were engaged at the fartheſt

                     <p>That part of the room which he ſtood in fell into a kind of receſs; and whether it was this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that prevented him from immediately perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, or that, his chief purpoſe being directed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another object, he did not chooſe to pauſe here, he paſſed on with ſkulking ſteps; and, before Ellena had determined whither to go, ſhe obſerved him croſs the court before her, and enter the avenue. As he had paſſed, he looked up at the window; and it was certain he then ſaw her, for he inſtantly faultered, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>It ſeemed that he had not yet encountered Schedoni, but it alſo occured to Ellena that he was gone into the avenue for the purpoſe of waiting to aſſaſſinate him in the darkneſs. While ſhe was meditating ſome means of giving the Confeſſor a timely alarm of his danger, ſhe once more diſtinguiſhed his voice. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached from the avenue, and Ellena immediately cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling aloud that Spalatro was there, entreated him to be on his guard. In the next inſtant a piſtol was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ired there.</p>
                     <p>Among the voices that ſucceeded the report, Ellena thought ſhe diſtinguiſhed groans. Schedoni's voice was in the next moment heard again, but it ſeemed faint and low, The courage which ſhe had before exerted was now exhauſted; ſhe remained fixed to the ſpot, unable to encounter the dreadful ſpectacle that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> probably awaited her in the avenue, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſinking beneath the expectation of it.</p>
                     <p>All was now huſhed; ſhe liſtened for Schedoni's voice, and even for a footſtep, in vain. To endure this
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:032735_0373_0FF4973C88A6E7A0"/>
ſtate of uncertainty much longer was ſcarcely poſſible, and Ellena was edenavouring to collect fortitude to meet a knowledge of the worſt, when ſuddenly a feeble groaning was again heard. It ſeemed near, and to be approaching ſtill nearer. At that moment, Ellena, on looking towards the avenue, perceived a figure covered with blood, paſs into the court. A film, which drew over her eyes, prevented her noticing farther, ſhe tottered a few paces back, and caught at the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a pillar, by which ſhe ſupported herſelf. The weakneſs was tranſient; immediate aſſiſtance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared neceſſary to the wounded perſon, and pity ſoon predominating over horror, ſhe recalled her ſpirits, and haſtened to the court.</p>
                     <p>When on reaching it, ſhe looked round in ſearch of Schedoni, he was no where to be ſeen; the court was again ſolitary and ſilent, till ſhe awakened all its echoes with the name of <hi>father.</hi> While ſhe repeated her calls, ſhe haſtily examined the colonnade, the ſeparated chamber which opened immediately from it, and the ſhadow ground beneath the palmetos, but without diſcovering any perſon.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe turned towards the avenue, however, a tract of blood on the ground told her too certainly where the wounded perſon had paſſed. It guided her to the entrance of a narrow paſſage, that ſeemingly led to the foot of the tower; but here ſhe heſitated, fearing to truſt the obſcurity beyond. For the firſt time, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena conjectured, that not Schedoni, but Spalatro might be the perſon ſhe had ſeen, and that, though he was wounded, vengeance might give him, ſtrength to ſtrike his ſtilletto at the heart of whomſoever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him, while the duſkineſs of the place would favour the deed.</p>
                     <p>She was yet at the entrance of the paſſage fearful to enter, and reluctant to leave it, liſtening for a ſound, and ſtill hearing at intervals, ſwelling though feeble

groans; when quickſteps were ſuddenly heard advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the grand avenue, and preſently her own name was repeated loudly in the voice of Schedoni. His manner was hurried as he advanced to meet her, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> he threw an eager glance round the court. "We muſt be gone," ſaid he, in a low tone, and taking her arm within his. "Have you ſeen any one paſs!"</p>
                     <p>"I have ſeen a wounded man enter the court," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Ellena, "and feared he was yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>"Where?—Which way did he go!" inquired Schedoni, eagerly, while his eyes glowed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his countenance became fell,</p>
                     <p>Ellena inſtantly comprehending his motive for the queſtion, would not acknowledge that ſhe knew whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spalatro had withdrawn; and, reminding him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>of the danger of their ſituation, ſhe entreated that they might quit the villa immediately.</p>
                     <p>"The ſun is already ſet," ſhe added. "I tremble at what may be the perils of this place at ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure hour, and even at what may be thoſe of our road at a later!"</p>
                     <p>"You are ſure he was wounded?" ſaid the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor.</p>
                     <p>"Too ſure," replied Ellena, faintly.</p>
                     <p>"Too ſure!" ſternly exclaimed Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>"Let us depart, my father; O let us go this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant!" repeated Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"What is the meaning of all this!" aſked Schedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, with anger. You cannot, ſurely, have the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to pity this fellow!"</p>
                     <p>"It is terrible to ſee any one ſuffer," ſaid Ellena. "Do not, by remaining here, leave me a poſſibility of grieving for you. What anguiſh it would occaſion you to ſee me bleed; judge then, what muſt be mine, if you are wounded by the dagger of an aſſaſſin!"</p>
                     <p>Schedoni ſtifled the groan which ſwelled from his heart, and abruptly turned away.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="85" facs="unknown:032735_0375_0FF4973E0DACB3B0"/>
"You trifle with me," he ſaid, in the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: "you do not know that the villain is wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I fired at him, it is true, at the inſtant I ſaw him enter the avenue, but he has eſcaped me. What reaſon have you for your ſuppoſition?"</p>
                     <p>Ellena was going to point to the tract of blood on the ground, at a little diſtance, but checked herſelf; conſidering that this might guide him on to Spala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro, and again ſhe entreated they might depart, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, "O! ſpare yourſelf, and him!"</p>
                     <p>"What! ſpare an aſſaſſin!" ſaid Schedoni, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently,</p>
                     <p>"An aſſaſſin! He <hi>has,</hi> then, attempted your life?" exclaimed Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"Why no, not abſolutely that," ſaid Schedoni, recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting himſelf,—"but what does the fellow do here? Let me paſs, I will find him.</p>
                     <p>Ellena ſtill hung upon his garment, while with perſuaſive tenderneſs, ſhe endeavoured to awaken his humanity. "O! if you had ever known what it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"Do you know for <hi>whom</hi> you are pleading?" ſaid the diſtracted Schedoni, while every word ſhe had ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſeemed to have penetrated his heart. The ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe which this queſtion awakened in Ellena's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, recalled him to a conſciouſneſs of his impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: he recollected that Ellena did not certainly know the office, with which Spalatro had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned againſt her: and when he conſidered that this very Spalatro whom Ellena had with ſuch ſimplicity ſuppoſed to have, at ſome time ſpared a life through pity, had in truth ſpared her own, and, yet more, had been eventually a means of preventing him from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying his own child, the Confeſſor turned in hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:032735_0376_0FF496F165103C48"/>
from his deſign; all his paſſions changed, and he abruptly quitted the court, nor pauſed till he reached the fartheſt extremity of the avenue, where the guide was in waiting with the horſes.</p>
                     <p>A recollection of the conduct of Spalatro reſpecting Ellena had thus induced Schedoni to ſpare him; but this was all; it did not prevail with him to enquire into the condition of this man, or to mitigate his puniſhment; and, without remorſe, he now left him to his fate.</p>
                     <p>With Ellena it was otherwiſe; though ſhe was ignorant of the obligation ſhe owed him, ſhe could not know that any human being was left under ſuch circumſtances of ſuffering and ſolitude, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periencing very painful emotions; but conſidering how expeditiouſly Spalatro had been able to remove himſelf, ſhe endeavoured to hope that his wound was not mortal.</p>
                     <p>The travellers, mounting their horſes in ſilence, left the ruin, and were for ſome time too much engaged by the impreſſion of the late occurrences, to converſe together. When, at length, Ellena inquired the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of what had paſſed in the avenue, ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that Schedoni, on purſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ing Spalatro, had ſeen him there only for a moment. Spalatro had eſcaped by ſome way unknown to the Confeſſor, and had regained the interior of the ruin, while his purſurers were yet following the avenue. The cry, which El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena had imagined to proceed from the interior, was uttered, as it now appeared, by the guide, who, in his haſte, had fallen over ſome fragments of the wall that lay ſcattered in the avenue: the firſt report of arms had been from the trombone, which Schedoni had diſcharged on reaching the portal; and the laſt, when he fired a piſtol, on perceiving Spalatro paſſing from the court.</p>
                     <p>"We have had trouble enough in running after this

fellow," ſaid the guide, "and could not catch him at laſt. It is ſtrange, that if he came to look for us, he ſhould run away ſo when he had found us! I do not think he meant us any harm, after all, elſe he might have done it eaſily enough in that dark paſſage; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead whereof he only took to his heels!"</p>
                     <p>"Silence!" ſaid Schedoni, "fewer words, friend."</p>
                     <p>"Well, Signor, he's peppered now, however; ſo we need not be afraid; his wings are clipped for one while, ſo he cannot overtake <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Did you ſo?" ſaid Schedoni, ſharply:" and pray where was you when you ſaw ſo much? It was more than I ſaw."</p>
                     <p>"I was cloſe at your heels, Signor, when you fired the piſtol."</p>
                     <p>"I do not remember to have heard you there," ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Confeſſor: "and why did you not come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, inſtead of retreating? And where, alſo, did you hide yourſelf while I was ſearching for the fellow, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of aſſiſting me in the purſuit?"</p>
                     <p>The guide gave no anſwer, and Ellena, who had been attentively obſerving him during the whole of this converſation, perceived that he was now conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably emba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

There was, however, at preſent no opportunity for further obſervation, Schedoni ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, contrary to the advice of the guide, immediately quickened his pace, and the horſes continuing on the full gallop, till a ſteep aſcent compelled them to relax their ſpeed.</p>

Contrary to his uſual habit, Schedoni now, while they ſlowly aſcended, appeared deſirous of converſing with this man, and aſked him ſeveral queſtions rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the villa they had left; and, whether it was that he really felt an intereſt on the ſubject, or that he wiſhed to diſcover if the man had deceived him in the circumſtances he had already narrated, from which he might form a judgment as to his general character, he preſſed his enquiries with a patient minuteneſs, that ſomewhat ſurpriſed Ellena. During this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, the deep twilight would no longer permit her to notice the countenances of either Schedoni, or the guide, but ſhe gave much attention to the chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tones of their voices, as different circumſtances and emotions ſeemed to affect them. It is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that during the whole of this diſcourſe, the guide rode at the ſide of Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>While the Confeſſor appeared to be muſing upon ſomething which the peaſant had related reſpecting the Barone di Cambruſca, Ellena inquired as to the fate of the other inhabitants of the villa,</p>
                     <p>"The falling of the old tower was enough for them," replied the guide; "the craſh waked them all directly, and they had time to get out of the new buildings, before the ſecond and third ſhocks laid them alſo in in ruins. They ran out into the woods for ſafety, and found it too, for they happened to take a different road from the earthquake. Not a ſoul ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, except the Barone, and he deſerved it well enough. O! I could tell ſuch things that I have heard of him!—"</p>
                     <p>"What became of the reſt of the family?" inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>"Why, Signor, they were ſcattered here and there, and every where; and they none of them ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the old ſpot. No! no! they had ſuffered enough there already, and might have ſuffered to this day, if the earthquake had not happened."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="89" facs="unknown:032735_0379_0FF4974C92DA7638"/>
"If it had <hi>not</hi> happened!" repeated Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"Aye, Signora, for that put an end to the Barone. If thoſe walls could but ſpeak, they would tell ſtrange things for they have looked upon ſad doings: and that chamber, which I ſhewed you, Signora, nobody ever went into it but himſelf, except the ſervant to kept it in order, and that he would ſcarcely ſuffer, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtaid in the room the while."</p>
                     <p>"He had probably treaſure ſecreted there," ſaid El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena.</p>

                     <p>"Come on," ſaid Schedoni, interrupted him; "keep pace with me. What idle dream are you relating now?"</p>
                     <p>"It is about the Barone di Cambruſca, Signor, him that you was aſking me ſo much about juſt now.

                     <p>"Yes, truly, Signor, he had, as I was going to tell, if you would but condeſcend to have patience."</p>
                     <p>"The Barone had more need of that, friend; I have no wife."—"The Barone's wife had moſt need of it, Signor, as you ſhall hear. A good ſoul, they ſay, was the Baroneſſa! but luckily ſhe died many years

                     <p>"How far is it to the inn?" ſaid the Confeſſor, roughly.</p>
                     <p>"When we get to the top of this hill, Signor, you will ſee it on the next, if any light is ſtirring, for there will only be the hollow between us. But do not be alarmed, Signor, the fellow we left cannot overtake us. Do you know much about him, Signor?"</p>
                     <p>Schedoni inquired whether the trombone was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, diſcovering that it was not, ordered the man to load immediately.</p>
                     <p>"Why, Signor, if you knew as much of him as I do, you could not be more afraid!" ſaid the peaſant, while he ſtopped to obey the order.</p>
                     <p>"I underſtood that he was a ſtranger to you!" obſerved the Confeſſor, with ſurpriſe.</p>
                     <p>"Why, Signor, he is, and he is not; I know more about him than he things for."</p>
                     <p>"You ſeem to know a vaſt deal too much of other perſons affairs," ſaid Schedoni, in a tone that was meant to ſilence him.</p>
                     <p>"Why, that is juſt what he would ſay, Signor; but bad deeds will out, whether people like them to be known or not. This man comes to our town ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to market, and nobody knew where he came from for a long while; ſo they ſet themſelves to work and found it out at laſt."</p>
                     <p>"We ſhall never reach the ſummit of this hill," ſaid Schedoni, teſtily.</p>
                     <p>"And they found out, too, a great many ſtrange things about him," continued the guide.</p>
                     <p>Ellena, who had attended to this diſcourſe with a degree of curioſity that was painful, now liſtened im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently for what might be farther mentioned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Spalatro, but without daring to invite, by a

ſingle queſtion, any diſcovery on a ſubject which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be ſo intimately connected with Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>"It was many years ago," rejoined the guide. "that this man came to live in that ſtrange houſe on the ſea-ſhore. It had been ſhut up ever ſince—"</p>
                     <p>"What are you talking of now?" interrupted the Confeſſor.</p>
                     <p>"Why, Signor, you never will let me tell you. You always ſnap me up ſo ſhort at the beginning, and then aſk—what am I talking about! I was going to begin the ſtory, and it is a pretty long one. But firſt of all, Signor, who do you ſuppoſe this man belonged to! And what do you think the people determined to do, when the report was firſt ſet a going? only they could not be ſure it was true, and any body would be unwilling enough to believe ſuch a ſhocking—"</p>
                     <p>"I have no curioſity on the ſubject," replied the Confeſſor, ſternly interrupting him; "and deſire to hear no more concerning it."</p>
                     <p>"I meant no harm, Signor," ſaid the man; "I did not know it concerned you."</p>

                     <p>"Nobody, Signor, only you ſeemed to be in a bit of a paſſion, and ſo I though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>—But I meant no harm, Signor, only as he happened to be your guide part of the way, I gueſſed you might like to know ſomething of him."</p>
                     <p>"All that I deſire to know of my guide is, that he does his duty," replied Schedoni "that he conducts me ſafely, and underſtands when to be ſilent."</p>
                     <p>To this the man replied nothing, but ſlackened his pace, and ſlunk behind his reprover.</p>
                     <p>The travellers reaching, ſoon after, the ſummit of this long hill, looked out for the inn of which they had been told; but darkneſs now confounded every object, and no domeſtic light twinkling, however diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly, through the gloom, gave ſignal of ſecurity and

comfort. They deſcended dejectedly into the hollow of the mountains, and found themſelves once more immerged in woods. Schedoni again called the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to his ſide, and bade him to keep abreaſt of him, but he did not diſcourſe; and Ellena was too thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to attempt converſation. The hints which the guide had thrown out reſpecting Spalatro, had increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her curioſity on that ſubject, but the conduct of Schedoni, his impatience, his embarraſſment, and the deciſive manner in which he had put an end to the talk of the guide, excited a degree of ſurprize, that bordered on aſtoniſhment. As ſhe had, however, no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The travellers having deſcended into the hollow, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> them. It was now ſo dark that the road, though the ſoil was a lime-ſtone, could ſcarcely be diſcerned, the woods on either ſide forming "a cloſe dungeon of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerous boughs," that totally excluded the twilight of the ſtars.</p>
                     <p>While the Confeſſor was queſtioning the man, with ſome ſeverity, a faint ſhouting was heard from a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and he ſtopped the horſes to liſten from what quarter it came.</p>
                     <p>"That comes the way we are going, Signor," ſaid the guide.</p>
                     <p>"Hark!" exclaimed Schedoni, "thoſe are ſtrains of revelry!"</p>
                     <p>A confuſed ſound of voices, laughter, and muſical inſtruments, was heard, and, as the air blew ſtronger, tamborines and flutes were diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! Oh! we are near the end of our journey!"
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:032735_0383_0FF4973F94B0A568"/>
ſaid the peaſant; "all this comes from the town we are going to. But what makes them all ſo merry I wonder!"</p>
                     <p>Ellena, revived by this intelligence, followed with alacrity the ſudden ſpeed of the Confeſſor; and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reaching a point of the mountain, where the woods opened a cluſter of lights on another ſummit, a little higher, more certainly announced the town.</p>
                     <p>They ſoon after arrived at the ruinous gates, which had formerly led to a place of ſome ſtrength, and paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at once from darkneſs and deſolated walls, into a market-place, blazing with light and reſounding with the multitude. Booths, fantaſtically hung with lamps, and filled with merchandize of every kind, diſpoſed in the gayeſt order, were ſpread on all ſides, and peaſants in their holiday cloaths, and parties of maſks crouded every evenue. Here was a bank of muſicians, and there a group of dancers; on one ſpot the <hi>outre</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of a zanni provoked the never failing laugh of an Italian rabble, in another the <hi>improviſatore,</hi> by the pathos of his ſtory, and the perſuaſive ſenſibility of his ſtrains, was holding the attention of his auditors, as in the bands of magic. Farther on was a ſtage raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a diſplay of fire works, and near this a theatre, where a mimic opera, the "ſhadow of a ſhade," was exhibiting, whence the roar of laughter, excited by the principal buffo within, mingled with the heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous voices of the venders of ice, maccaroni, ſherbet, and diavoloni, without.</p>
                     <p>The Confeſſor looked upon this ſcene with diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and ill-humour, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

"To think I ſhould not know it was the time of the fair!" ſaid he, "though to ſay truth, I never was at it but once in my life, ſo it is not ſo ſurpriſing, Signor."</p>

Well! Signor, you have forgot all your quandaries now; you think nothing now about that old ruinous place where we had ſuch a race after the man, that would not murder us; but that ſhot I fired did his buſineſs."</p>
                     <p>"You fired!" ſaid Schedoni, arouſed by the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Signor, as I was looking over your ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; I ſhould have thought you muſt have heard it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"</p>
                     <p>"I ſhould have thought ſo, too, friend."</p>
                     <p>"Aye, Signor, this fine place has put all that out of your head, I warrant, as well as what I ſaid about that ſame fellow; but, indeed Signor, I did not know he was related to you, when I talked ſo of him. But, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, for all that you may not know, the piece of his ſtory I was going to tell you, when you cut me off ſo ſhort, though you are better acquainted with one another than I gueſſed for; ſo, when I come in from the fair, Signor, if you pleaſe, I will tell it you; and it is a pretty long hiſtory, for I happen to know the whole of it; though, where you cut me ſhort, when you was in one of thoſe quandaries, was only juſt a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"What is all this!" ſaid Schedoni, again recalled from one of the thoughtful moods in which he had ſo habitually indulged, that even the buſtle a round him had failed to interrupt the courſe of his mind. He now bade the peaſant be ſilent; but the man was too happy to be tractable, and proceeded to expreſs all he felt, as they advanced ſlowly through the crowd. Every object here was to him new and delightful;
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:032735_0385_0FF49758CF1874C8"/>
and, nothing doubting that it muſt be equally ſo to every other perſon, he was continually pointing out to the proud and gloomy Confeſſor the trivial ſubjects of his own admiration. "See, Signor, there is Punchinello, ſee! how he eats the hot maccaroni! And look there, Signor! there is a juggler! O! good Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, ſtop one minute, to look at his tricks. See! he has turned a monk into a devil already, in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an eye!"</p>
                     <p>"Silence! and proceed," ſaid Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>"That is what I ſay, Signor:—ſilence! for the people make ſuch a noiſe that I cannot hear a word you ſpeak.—Silence, there!"</p>
                     <p>"Conſidering that you could not hear, you have anſwered, wonderfully to the purpoſe," ſaid Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! Signora! is not this better than thoſe dark woods and hills? But what have we here? Look, Signor, here is a fine ſight!"</p>
                     <p>The croud which was aſſembled round a ſtage on which ſome perſons groteſquely dreſſed, were perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, now, interrupting farther progreſs, the travellers were compelled to ſtop at the foot of the platform. The people above were acting what ſeemed to have been intended for a tragedy, but what their ſtrange geſtures, uncouth recitation, and incongruous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, had transformed into a comedy.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni thus obliged to pauſe, withdrew his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the ſcene; Ellena conſented to endure it, and the peaſant, with gaping mouth and ſtaring eye, ſtood like a ſtatue, yet not knowing whether he ought to laugh or cry, till ſuddenly turning round to the Confeſſor, whoſe horſe was, of neceſſity, cloſe to his, he ſeized his arm, and pointing to the ſtage, called out, "Look! Signor, ſee! Signor, what a ſcoundrel! what a villain! See! he has murdered his own daughter!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="unknown:032735_0386_0FF496FFC7B8C6B0"/>
At theſe terrible words, the indignation of Schedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni was done away by other emotions; he turned his eyes upon the ſtage, and perceived that the actors were performing the ſtory of Virginia. It was at a moment when ſhe was dying in the arms of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was holding up the poignard, with which he had ſtabbed her. The feelings of Schedoni, at this inſtant, inflicted a puniſhment almoſt worthy of the crime he had meditated.</p>
                     <p>Ellena, ſtruck with the action, and with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt which it ſeemed to offer to what ſhe had believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to have been the late conduct of Schedoni towards herſelf, looked at him with moſt expreſſive tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and as his glance met her's ſhe perceived, with ſurprize, the changing emotions of his ſoul, and the inexplicable character of his countenance. Stung to the heart, the Confeſſor furiouſly ſpurred his horſe that he might eſcape from the ſcene, but the poor animal was too ſpiritleſs and jaded, to force its way through the crowd; and the peaſant, vexed at being hurried from a place, where, almoſt for the firſt time in his life, he was ſuffering under the ſtrange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of artificial grief, and, half angry, to obſerve a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Schedoni was not in a humour which rendered him ſit to encounter difficulties, and ſtill leſs the vulgar ſquabbles of a place already crowded with gueſts; yet it was not without much oppoſition, that he at length obtained a lodging for the night. The pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant was not leſs anxious for the accommodation of his horſes; and when Ellena heard him declare, that

the animal, which the Confeſſor had ſo cruelly ſpurred, ſhould have a double feed, and a bed of ſtraw as high as his head, if he himſelf went without one, ſhe gave him, unnoticed by Schedoni, the only ducat ſhe had left.</p>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ceding evening had not only renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the agonies of remorſe, but excited thoſe of pride and apprehenſion. There was ſomething in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the peaſant towards him, which he could not clearly underſtand, though his ſuſpicions were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to throw his mind into a ſtate of the utmoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation. Under an air of extreme ſimplicity, this man had talked of Spalatro, had diſcovered that he was acquainted with much of his hiſtory, and had hinted, that he knew by whom he had been employed; yet, at the ſame time, appeared unconſcious, that Schedoni's was the maſter-hand, which had directed the principal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ruffian. At other times, his behaviour had ſeemed to contradict the ſuppoſition of his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance on this point; from ſome circumſtances he had mentioned, it appeared impoſſible but that he muſt have known who Schedoni really was, and even his own conduct had occaſionally ſeemed to acknowledge this, particularly when, being interrupted in his hiſtory of Spalatro, he attempted an apology, by ſaying, he did not know it concerned Schedoni: nor could the conſcious Schedoni believe, that the very pointed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which the peaſant had addreſſed him at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of Virginia, was merely accidental. He wiſhed to diſmiſs the man immediately, but it was firſt neceſſary to aſcertain what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e knew concerning him, and then to decide on the meaſures to be taken. It was, however, a difficult matter to obtain this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:032735_0389_0FF4975BDFE9AD80"/>
without manifeſting an anxiety, which might betray him, if the guide had, at preſent, only a general ſuſpicion of the truth; and no leſs difficult to determine how to proceed towards him, if it ſhould be evident that his ſuſpicions reſted on Spalatro. To take him forward to Naples, was to bring an informer to his home; to ſuffer him to return with his diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, now that he probably knew the place of Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni's reſidence, was little leſs hazardous. His death only could ſecure the ſecret,</p>
                     <p>After a night paſſed in the tumult of ſuch conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, the Confeſſor ſummoned the peaſant to his chamber, and, with ſome ſhort preface, told him he had no further occaſion for his ſervices, adding, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly, that he adviſed him to be on his guard as he paſſed the villa, leſt Spalatro, who might yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>urk there, ſhould revenge upon him the injury he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. "According to your account of him, he is a very dangerous fellow," ſaid Schedoni; "but your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is, perhaps, erroneous."</p>
                     <p>The guide began, teſtily, to juſtify himſelf for his aſſertions, and the Confeſſor then endeavoured to draw from him what he knew on the ſubject. But, whether the man was piqued by the treatment he had lately received, or had other reaſons for reſerve, he did not at firſt appear ſo willing to communicate as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</p>
                     <p>"What you hinted of this man," ſaid Schedoni, "has, in ſome degree, excited curioſity: I have now a few moments of leiſure, and you may relate, if you will, ſomething of the wonderful hiſtory you talked of."</p>
                     <p>"It is a long ſtory, Signor, and you would be tired before I got to the end of it," replied the peaſant; "and, craving your pardon, Signor I don't much like to be ſnapped up ſo!"</p>
                     <p>"Where did this man live?" ſaid the Confeſſor.</p>

"You mentioned ſomething of a houſe at the ſea ſide."</p>
                     <p>"Aye, Signor, there is a ſtrange hiſtory belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that houſe, too; but this man, as I was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, came there all of a ſudden, nobody knew how! and the place had been ſhut up ever ſince the Marcheſe—"</p>
                     <p>"The Marcheſe!" ſaid Schedoni, coldly, "what Marcheſe, friend?"—"Why, I mean the Barone di Cambruſca, Signor, to be ſure, as I was going to have told you, of my own accord, if you would only have let me. Shut up ever ſince the Barone—I left off there, I think."</p>
                     <p>"I underſtood that the Barone was dead!" obſerved the Confeſſor.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Signor," replied the peaſant, fixing his eyes on Schedoni; "but what has his death to do with what I was telling? This happened before he died."</p>
                     <p>Schedoni, ſome what diſconcerted by this unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed remark, forgot to reſent the familiarity of it. "This man, then, this Spalatro, was Connected with the Barone di Cambruſca?" ſaid he.</p>

                     <p>"How! no more than gueſſed?"</p>
                     <p>"No, Signor, and that was more than enough for the Barone's liking, I warrant. He took too much care for any thing certain to appear againſt him, and he was wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e ſo to do, for if it had—it would have been worſe for him. But I was going to tell you the ſtory, Signor."</p>
                     <p>"What reaſons were there for believing this was an agent of the Barone di Cambruſca, friend?"</p>
                     <p>"I thought you wiſhed to hear the ſtory, Signor."</p>
                     <p>"In good time; but firſt, what were your reaſons?"</p>
                     <p>"One of them is enough, Signor, and if you would only have let me gone ſtraight on with the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

you would have found it out by this time, Signor."</p>
                     <p>Schedoni frowned, but did not otherwiſe reprove the impertinence of the ſpeech.</p>
                     <p>"It was reaſon enough, Signor, to my mind," continued the peaſant, "that it was ſuch a crime as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body but the Barone di Cambruſca could have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; there was nobody wicked enough, in our parts, to have done it but him. Why is not this <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> enough, Signor? What makes you look at me ſo, why the Barone himſelf could hardly have looked worſe, if I had told him as much!"</p>
                     <p>"Be leſs prolix," ſaid the Confeſſor, in a reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed voice.</p>
                     <p>"Well then, Signor, to begin at the beginning. It is a good many years ago, that Marco came firſt to our town. Now the ſtory goes, that one ſtormy night—"</p>
                     <p>"You may ſpare yourſelf the trouble of relating the ſtory," ſaid Schedoni, abruptly, "Did you ever ſee the Barone you was ſpeaking of friend?"</p>
                     <p>"Why did you bid me tell it, Signor, ſince you know it already! I have been here all this while, juſt a-going to begin it, and all for nothing!"</p>
                     <p>"It is very ſurpriſing," reſumed the artful Schedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, without having noticed what had been ſaid, "that if this Spalatro was known to be the villian you ſay he is, not any ſtep ſhould have been taken to bring him to juſtice! now happened that? But, perhaps, all this ſtory was nothing more than a report."</p>
                     <p>"Why, Signor, it was every body's buſineſs, and nobody's as one may ſay; then, beſides, nobody could prove what they had heard, and, though every body believed the ſtory juſt the ſame as if they had ſeen the whole, yet that, they ſaid, would not do in law, but they ſhould be made to prove it. Now, it is not one time in ten that any thing can be proved, Signor, as you well know, yet we none of us believe it the leſs for that!"</p>

"So then, you would have had this man puniſhed for a murder, which, probably, he never commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted!" ſaid the Confeſſor.</p>

                     <p>"Well, Signor, I will do my beſt to make it ſhort. It was one ſtormy night in December, that Marco Torma had been out fiſhing. Marco, Signor, was an old man that lived in our town when I was a boy; I can but juſt remember him, but my father knew him well and loved old Marco, and uſed often to ſay—"</p>

                     <p>"Why I am telling it, Signor, as faſt as I can. This old Marco did not live in our town at the time it happened, but in ſome place, I have forgot the name of it, near the ſea ſhore. What can the name be! it is ſomething like—"</p>
                     <p>"Well, what happened to this old dotard?"</p>
                     <p>"You are out there, Signor, he was no old dotard; but you ſhall hear. At that time, Signor, Marco li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this place that I have forgot the name of, and was a fiſherman, but better times turned up after af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:032735_0393_0FF4975E5B0C5100"/>
but that is neither here nor there. Old Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co had been out fiſhing; it was a ſtormy night and he was glad to get on ſhore, I warrant. It was quite dark, as dark Signor, as it was laſt night, and he was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the beſt of his way, Signor, with ſome fiſh along the ſhore, but it being ſo dark, he loſt it notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.

He got as far off as he could, but he knew there were high rocks over the beach, and he was afraid he ſhould run his head againſt them, if he went too far, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. However at laſt, he went up cloſe to them, and as he got a little ſhelter, he reſolved to try no further for the preſent. I tell it you, Signor, juſt as my father told it me, and he had it from the old man himſelf."</p>
                     <p>"You need not be ſo particular," replied the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor: "ſpeak to the point."</p>
                     <p>"Well, Signor, as old Marco lay ſnug under the rocks, he thought he heard ſomebody coming, and he lifted up his head, I warrant, poor old ſoul! as if he could have ſeen who it was; however he could hear, though it was ſo dark, and he heard the ſteps coming on; but he ſaid nothing yet, meaning to let them come cloſe up to him, before he diſcovered himſelf. Preſently he ſees a little moving light, and it comes nearer and nearer, till it was juſt oppoſite to him, and then he ſaw the ſhadow of a man on the ground, and then ſpied the man himſelf, with a dark lanthorn, paſſing along the beach."</p>

                     <p>"Poor old Marco, Signor began to think better of him, and when he heard the rain at the caſements, he was loath to think of ſtirring. Preſently Spalatro went out of the room for a plate to eat the fiſh on—"</p>

                     <p>"Why Signor, old Marco had like to have caught his death that night; what with wet, and what with fright, he was laid up with a fever, and was light-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and raved of ſuch ſtrange things, that people would not believe any thing he ſaid when he came to his ſenſes,"</p>
                     <p>"Aye, ſaid Schedoni, the narrative reſembles a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerious dream, more than a reality; I perfectly accord with them in their opinion of this feveriſh old man."</p>
                     <p>"But you ſhall hear, Signor; after a while they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think better of it, and there was ſome ſtir made about it; but what could poor folks do, for nothing could be proved!

                     <p>"I have liſtened too long to this idle hiſtory," ſaid the Confeſſor, "there ſeems to be no rational found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for it. Here is what I owe you; you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part."</p>
                     <p>"Well, but, Signor, 'tis plain you know the reſt already, or you never would go without it. But you don't know perhaps, Signor what an unaccountable—I am ſure it made my hair ſtand on end to hear of it what an unaccountable—"</p>
                     <p>"I will hear no more of this abſurdity," interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Schedoni, with ſternneſs. "I reproach myſelf for having liſtened ſo long to ſuch a goſſip's tale, and have no further curioſity concerning it. You may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw; and bid the hoſt attend me."</p>
                     <p>"Well, Signor, if you are ſo eaſily ſatisfied," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the peaſant, with diſappointment, "there is no more to be ſaid, but—"</p>
                     <p>"You may ſtay, however, while I caution you," ſaid Schedoni, "how you paſs the villa, where this Spalatro may yet linger, for, though I can only ſmile at the ſtory you have related—"</p>
                     <p>"Related, Signor! why I have not told it half; and if you ſhould only pleaſe to be patient—"</p>
                     <p>"Though I can only ſmile at that ſimple narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,"—repeated Schedoni in a louder tone.</p>
                     <p>"Nay, Signor, for that matter, you can frown at it too, as I can teſtify," muttered the guide.</p>
                     <p>"Liſten to me!" ſaid the Confeſſor, in a yet more inſiſting voice. "I ſay, that though I give no credit
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:032735_0401_0FF4976D79DAAF28"/>
to your curious hiſtory, I think this ſame Spalatro appears to be a deſperate fellow, and therefore, I would have you be on your guard. If you ſee him, you may depend upon it, that he will attempt your life in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the injury I have done him. I give you, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in addition to your trombone, this ſtiletto to defend you."</p>
                     <p>Schedoni, while he ſpoke, took an inſtrument from his boſom, but it was not the one he uſually wore, or, at leaſt, that he was ſeen to wear. He delivered it to the peaſant, who received it with a kind of ſtupid ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and then gave him ſome directions as to the way in which it ſhould be managed.</p>
                     <p>"Why, Signor," ſaid the man, who had liſtened with much attention, "I am kindly obliged to you for thinking about me, but is there any thing in this ſtiletto different from others, that it is to be uſed ſo?"</p>
                     <p>Schedoni looked gravely on the peaſant for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and then replied, "Certainly not, friend, I would only inſtruct you to uſe it to the beſt advantage; fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well!"</p>
                     <p>"Thank you kindly, Signor, but—but I think I have no need of it, my trombone is enough for me."</p>
                     <p>"This will defend you more adroitly," replied Schedoni, refuſing to take back the ſtiletto, "and moreover, while you were loading the trombone, your adverſary might uſe his poignard to advantage. Keep it, therefore, friend; it will protect you better than a dozen trombones. Put it up."</p>
                     <p>Perhaps it was Schedoni's particular look, more than his argument, that convinced the guide of the value of his gift; he received it ſubmiſſively, though with a ſtare of ſtupid ſurpriſe; probable it had been better if it had been ſuſpicious ſurpriſe. He thanked Schedoni again, and was leaving the room, when the Confeſſor called out, "Send the landlord to me imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:032735_0402_0FF497CF334B7840"/>
I ſhall ſet off for Rome without delay!"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Signor," replied the peaſant, "you are at the right place, the road parts here; but I thought you was going for Naples!"</p>
                     <p>"For Rome," ſaid Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>"For Rome, Signor! Well, I hope you will get ſafe, Signor, with all my heart!" ſaid the guide, and quitted the chamber.</p>
                     <p>While this dialogue had been paſſing between Schedoni and the peaſant, Ellena, in ſolitude, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering on the means of prevailing with the Confeſſor to allow her to return either to Altieri, or to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring cloiſter of "<hi>Our Lady of Pity,</hi>" inſtead of placing her at a diſtance from Naples, till he ſhould think proper to acknowledge her. The plan, which he had mentioned, ſeemed to her long-harraſſed mind to exile her for ever from happineſs, and all that was dear to her affections; it appeared like a ſecond ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment to San Stefano, and every abbeſs, except that of the <hi>Santa della Pieta,</hi> came to her imagination in the portraiture of an inexorable jailor. While this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject engaged her, ſhe was ſummoned to attend Schedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, whom ſhe found impatient to enter the carriage, which at this town they had been able to procure. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena, on looking out for the guide, was informed that he had already ſet off for his home, a circumſtance, for the ſuddenneſs of which ſhe knew not how to account.</p>
                     <p>The travellers immediately proceeded on their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; Schedoni, reflecting on the late converſation, ſaid little, and Ellena read not in his countenance any thing that might encourage her to introduce the ſubject of her own intended ſolicitation. Thus ſeparately occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, they advanced, during ſome hours, on the road to Naples, for thither Schedoni had deſigned to go, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his late aſſertion to the guide, whom it appears, for whatever reaſon, he was anxious to deceive, as to the place of his actual reſidence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="unknown:032735_0403_0FF49777DA805128"/>
They ſtopped to dine at a town of ſome conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and, when Ellena heard the Confeſſor enquire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the numerous convents it contained, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that it was neceſſary for her no longer to defer her petition. She therefore repreſented immediately what muſt be the forlornneſs of her ſtate, and the anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety of her mind, if ſhe were placed at a diſtance from the ſcenes and the people, which affection and early ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit ſeemed to have conſecrated; eſpecially at this time, when her ſpirits had ſcarcely recovered from the ſevere preſſure of long ſuffering, and when to ſooth and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ovate them, not only quiet, but the conſciouſneſs of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, were neceſſary; a conſciouſneſs which it was impoſſible, and eſpecially ſo after her late experience, that ſhe could acquire among ſtrangers till they ſhould ceaſe to be ſuch.</p>
                     <p>To theſe pleadings Schedoni thoughtfully attended, but the darkneſs of his aſpect did not indicate that his compaſſion was touched; and Ellena proceeded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, ſecondly, that, which, had ſhe been more art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or leſs diſdainful of cunning, ſhe would have urged the firſt.</p>
                     <p>As it was, ſhe had begun with the mention of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which, though the leaſt likely to prevail with Schedoni, ſhe felt to be moſt important to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſhe concluded with repreſenting that, which was moſt intereſting to him. Ellena ſuggeſted, that her reſidence in the neighborhood of Altieri might be ſo managed, as that his ſecret would be as effectually preſerved, as if ſhe were an hundred miles from Naples.</p>
                     <p>It may appear extraordinary, that a man of Schedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni's habitual coolneſs, and exact calculation, ſhould have ſuffered fear, on this occaſion, to obſcure his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and this inſtance ſtrongly proved the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the cauſe, which could produce ſo powerful an effect. While he now liſtened to Ellena, he began to perceive circumſtances that had eluded his own obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:032735_0404_0FF497D0B98DDB30"/>
and he, at length, acknowledged, that it might be ſafer to permit her to return to the Villa Altieri, and that ſhe ſhould from thence go, as ſhe had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended, to the <hi>Santa della Pieta,</hi> than to place her in any convent, however remote, where it would be neceſſary for himſelf to introduce her. His only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining objection to the neighborhood of Naples, now reſted on the chance it would offer the Marcheſa di Vivaldi of diſcovering Ellena's abode, before he ſhould judge it convenient to diſcloſe to her his family; and his knowledge of the Marcheſa juſtified his moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſuſpicion, as to the conſequence of ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature diſcovery,</p>
                     <p>Something, however, it appeared, muſt be riſked in any ſituation he might chooſe for Ellena; and her reſidence at the <hi>Santa della Pieta,</hi> a large convent, well ſecured, and where, as ſhe had been known to them from her infancy, the abbeſs and the ſiſters might be ſuppoſed to be not indifferent concerning her welfare, ſeemed to promiſe ſecurity againſt any actual violence from the malice of the Marcheſa; againſt her artful du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity every place would be almoſt equally inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Here, as Ellena would appear in the character ſhe had always been known in, no curioſity could be excited, or ſuſpicion awakened, as to her family; and here therefore Schedoni's ſecret would more probably be preſerved, than elſewhere. As this was, after all, the predominant ſubject of his anxiety, to which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever unnatural it may ſeem, even the ſafety of Ellena was ſecondary, he finally determined, that ſhe ſhould return to the <hi>Santa della Pieta;</hi> and ſhe thanked him almoſt with tears, for a conſent which ſhe received as a generous indulgence, but which was in reality little more than an effect of ſelfiſh apprehenſion.</p>
                     <p>The remainder of the journey, which was of ſome days, paſſed without any remarkable occurrence: Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni, with only ſhort intervals, was ſtill enveloped in
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:032735_0405_0FF49779619F3D20"/>
gloom and ſilence; and Ellena, with thoughts engaged by the one ſubject of her intereſt, the preſent ſituation and circumſtances of Vivaldi, willingly ſubmitted to this prolonged ſtillneſs.</p>
                     <p>As, at length, ſhe drew near Naples, her emotions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more various and powerful; and, when ſhe diſtinguiſhed the top of Veſuvius peeping over every intervening ſummit, ſhe wept as her imagination cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ractered all the well-known country it overlooked. But when, having reached an eminence, that ſcenery was exhibited to her ſenſes, when the Bay of Naples, ſtretching into remoteſt diſtance, was ſpread out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her; when every mountain of that magnificent horizon, which incloſed her native landſcape, that country which ſhe believed Vivaldi to inhabit, ſtood unfolded, how affecting, how overwhelming were her ſenſations! Every object ſeemed to ſpeak of her home, of Vivaldi, and of happineſs that was paſſed! and ſo exquiſitely did regret mingle with hope, the tender grief of remembrance with the intereſt of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, that it were difficult to ſay which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed.</p>
                     <p>Her expreſſive countenance diſcloſed to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor the courſe of her thoughts and of her feelings, feelings which, while he contemned, he believed he perfectly comprehended, but of which, having never in any degree experienced them, he really underſtood nothing. The callous Schedoni, by a miſtake not uncommon, eſpecially to a mind of his character, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted words for truths; not only confounding the limits of nighbouring qualities, but miſtaking their very principles. Incapable of perceiving their nice diſtinctions, he called the perſons who ſaw them, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fanciful; thus making his very incapacity an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his ſuperior wiſdom. And, while he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded delicacy of feeling with ſatiety of the mind, taſte with caprice, and imagination with error, he
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:032735_0406_0FF497D24376F680"/>
yielded, when he moſt congratulated himſelf on hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> contrived not to reach Naples till the cloſe of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and it was entirely dark before the carriage ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at the villa Altieri. Ellena with a mixture of melancholy and ſatisfaction, viewed, once more, her long deſerted home, and while ſhe waited till a ſervant ſhould open the gate, remembered how often ſhe had thus waited when there was a beloved friend within, to welcome her with ſmiles, which were now gone for ever. Beatrice, the old houſekeeper, at length, however, appeared, and received her with an affection as ſincere, if not as ſtrong, as that of the relative for whom ſhe mourned.</p>
                     <p>Here Schedoni alighted, and, having diſmiſſed the carriage, entered the houſe for the purpoſe of relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing alſo his diſguiſe, and reſuming his monk's habit. Before he departed, Ellena ventured to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Vivaldi, and to expreſs her wiſh to hear of his exact ſituation; but, though Schedoni was too well enabled to inform her of it, policy which had hitherto kept him ſilent on this ſubject ſtill influenced him; and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied only, that if he ſhould happen to learn the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his condition, ſhe ſhould not remain ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of them.</p>
                     <p>This aſſurance revived Ellena, for two reaſons; it afforded her a hope of relief from her preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, and it alſo ſeemed to expreſs an approbation of the object of her affection, ſuch as the Confeſſor never had yet diſcloſed. Schedoni added, that he ſhould ſee her no more, till he thought proper to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge her for his daughter; but that, if circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances made it neceſſary, he ſhould, in the mean time, write to her; and he now gave her a direction by
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:032735_0407_0FF4977AE7962BA8"/>
which to addreſs him under a fictitious name, and at a place remote from his convent. Ellena, though aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the neceſſity for this conduct, could not yield to ſuch diſguiſe, without an averſion that was ſtrongly expreſſed in her manner, but of which Schedoni took no notice. He bade her, as ſhe valued her exiſtence, watchfully to preſerve the ſecret of her birth; and to waſte not a ſingle day at Villa Altieri, but to retire to the <hi>Santa della Pieta;</hi> and theſe injunctions were delivered in a manner ſo ſolemn &amp; energetic, as not only deeply to impreſs upon her mind the neceſſity of fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, but to excite ſome degree of amazement.</p>
                     <p>After a ſhort and general direction reſpecting her further conduct, Schedoni bade her farewell, and, privately quitting the villa, in his eccleſiaſtical dreſs, repaired to the dominican convent, which he entered as a brother returned from a diſtant pilgrimage. He was received as uſual, by the ſociety, and found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, once more, the auſtere father Schedoni of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rito Sancto.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of his firſt anxiety was the neceſſity for juſtifying himſelf to the Marcheſa di Vivaldi, for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaining how much he might venture to reveal of the truth, and for eſtimating what would be her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, were ſhe informed of the whole. His ſecond ſtep would be to obtain the releaſe of Vivaldi; and, as his conduct in this inſtance would be regulated, in a great degree, by the reſult of his conference with the Marcheſa, it would be only the ſecond. However painful it muſt be to Schedoni to meet her, now that he had diſcovered the depth of the guilt, in which ſhe would have involved him, he determined to ſeek this eventful conference on the following morning: and he paſſed this night partly in uneaſy expectation of the approaching day, but chiefly in inventing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and arranging arguments, that might bear him triumphantly towards the accompliſhment of his grand deſign.</p>

                     <p>At the palace he was told, the Marcheſa was at one of her villas on the bay; and he was too anxious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

This delightful reſidence was ſituated on an airy promontory, that overhung the water, and was nearly emboſomed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the woods, that ſpread far along the heights, and deſcended with great pomp of foliage and colouring, to the very margin of the waves. It ſeemed ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſible that miſery could inhabit ſo enchanting an abode; yet the Marcheſa was wretched amidſt all theſe luxuri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s of nature and art, which would have perfected the happineſs of an innocent mind. Her heart was poſſeſſed by evil paſſions, and all her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions were diſtorted and diſcoloured by them, which, like a dark magician, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The ſervants had orders to admit father Schedoni
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:032735_0409_0FF4977C6DADCD48"/>
at all times, and he was ſhewn into a ſaloon in which the Marcheſa was alone. Every object in this apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment announced taſte, and even magnificence. The hangings were of purple and gold; the vaulted cieling was deſigned by one of the firſt painters of the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian ſchool; the marble ſtatues that adorned the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes were not leſs exquiſite, and the whole ſymmetry and architecture airy, yet rich; gay, yet chaſtened; reſembled the palace of a fairy, and ſeemed to poſſeſs almoſt equal faſcinations. The lattices were thrown open, to admit the proſpect, as well as the air loaded with fragrance from an orangery that ſpread before them. Lofty palms and plantains threw their green and refreſhing tint over the windows, and on the lawn that ſloped to the edge of the precipice, a ſhadowy perſpective, beyond which appeared the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple waters of the gulf, where the light ſails of feluccas, and the ſpreading canvaſs of larger veſſels, glided up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſcene and paſſed away, as in a camera obſcura. Veſuvius and the city of Naples were ſeen on the coaſt beyond, with many a bay and lofty cape of that long tract of bold and gaily-coloured ſcenery, which extends towards Cape Campanella, crowned by fading ranges of mountains, lighted up with all the magic of Italian ſunſhine. The Marcheſa reclined on a ſofa before an open lattice; her eyes were fixed upon the proſpect without, but her attention was wholly occupied by the viſions that evil paſſions painted to her imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. On her ſtill beautiful features was the languor of diſcontent and indiſpoſition; and, though her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, like her dreſs, diſplayed the elegant negligence of the graces, they concealed the movements of a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and even a tortured heart. On perceiving Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni, a faint ſmile lightened upon her countenance, and ſhe held forth her hand to him; at the touch of which he ſhuddered.</p>
                     <p>"My good father, I rejoice to ſee you," ſaid the
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:032735_0410_0FF497DE47386768"/>
Marcheſa; "I have felt the want of your conver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion much, and at this moment of indiſpoſition eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially."</p>
                     <p>She waved the attendant to withdraw; while Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni, ſtalking to a window, could with difficulty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the perturbation with which he now, for the firſt time, conſciouſly beheld the willing deſtroyer of his child. Some farther compliment from the Marcheſa recalled him; he ſoon recovered all his addreſs, and approaching her, ſaid.</p>
                     <p>"Daughter! you always ſend me away a worſe Dominican than I come; I approach you with humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but depart elated with pride, and am obliged to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer much from ſelf-infliction before I can deſcend to my proper level."</p>
                     <p>After ſome other flatteries had been exchanged, a ſilence of ſeveral moments followed, during which neither of the parties ſeemed to have ſufficient cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to introduce the ſubjects that engaged their thoughts, ſubjects upon which their intereſts were now ſo directly and unexpectedly oppoſite. Had Schedoni been leſs occupied by his own feelings, he might have perceived the extreme agitation of the Marcheſa, the tremor of her nerves, the faint fluſh that croſſed her che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap> that interrupted her breathing, while ſhe wiſhed, yet dared not aſk, whether Ellena was no more and avert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her regards from him, whom ſhe almoſt believed to be a murderer.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni, not leſs affected, though apparently tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil, as ſedulouſly avoided the face of the Marcheſa, whom he conſidered with a degree of contempt almoſt equal to his in dignotion: his feelings had reverſed, for the preſent, all his opinions on the ſubject of their former arguments, and had taught him, for once, to think juſtly. Every moment of ſilence now
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:032735_0411_0FF49786725ED620"/>
encreaſed his embarraſſment, and his reluctance even to name Ellena. He feared to tell that ſhe lived, yet deſpiſed himſelf for ſuffering ſuch fear, and ſhuddered at a recollection of the conduct, which had made any aſſurance concerning her life neceſſary. The inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, that he had diſcovered her family to be ſuch as would not degrade that of the Marcheſa, he knew not how to introduce with ſuch delicacy of gradation as might win upon the jealouſy of her pride, and ſoothe her diſappointment; and he was ſtill meditating how he might lead to this ſubject, when the Marcheſa her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf broke the ſilence.</p>
                     <p>"Father," ſhe ſaid, with a ſigh, "I always look to you for conſolation, and am ſeldom diſappointed. You are too well acquainted with the anxiety which has long oppreſſed me; may I underſtand that the cauſe of it is removed?" She pauſed, and then added, "May I hope that my ſon will no longer be led from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of his duty?"</p>
                     <p>Schedoni, with his eyes fixed on the ground, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſilent, but, at length, ſaid, "the chief occaſion of your anxiety is certainly removed,"—and he was again ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"How!" exclaimed the Marcheſa, with the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fightedneſs of ſuſpicion, while all her diſſimulation yielded to the urgency of her fear, "Have you ſailed? Is ſhe not dead?"</p>
                     <p>In the earneſtneſs of the queſtion, ſhe fixed her eyes on Schedoni's face and perceiving there ſymptoms of extraordinary emotion, added, "Relieve me from my apprehenſions, good father, I entreat; tell me that you have ſucceeded, and that ſhe has paid the debt of juſtice."</p>
                     <p>Schedoni raiſed his eyes to the Marcheſa, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly averted them; indignation had lifted them, and diſguſt and ſtifled horror turned them away. Though very little of theſe feelings appeared, the Marcheſa
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:032735_0412_0FF497DFCC0C51F0"/>
perceived ſuch expreſſion as ſhe had never been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to obſerve in his countenance; and, her ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and impatience encreaſing, ſhe once more repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the queſtion, and with a yet more deciſive air than before.</p>
                     <p>"I have not failed in the grand object," replied Schedoni: "your ſon is no longer in danger of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a diſgraceful alliance."</p>
                     <p>"In what, then, have you failed?" aſked the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa; for I perceive that you have not been complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceſsful."</p>
                     <p>"I ought not to ſay that I have failed in any reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect," replied Schedoni, with emotion, "ſince the honor of your houſe is preſerved, and—a life is ſpared."</p>
                     <p>His voice faultered as he pronounced the laſt words, and he ſeemed to experience again the horror of that moment, when, with an uplifted poignard in his graſp, he had diſcovered Ellena for his daughter.</p>
                     <p>"Spared!" repeated the Marcheſa, doubtingly; explain yourſelf, good father!"</p>
                     <p>"She lives," replied Schedoni; "but you have nothing, therefore, to apprehend."</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa, ſurpriſed no leſs by the tone in which he ſpoke, and ſhocked at the purport of his words, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged countenance, while ſhe ſaid, impatiently—"You ſpeak in enigmas, father,"</p>
                     <p>"Lady! I ſpeak plain truth—ſhe lives."</p>
                     <p>"I underſtand that ſufficiently," ſaid the Marcheſa, out when you tell me, I have nothing to apprehend."</p>
                     <p>"I tell you truth, alſo" rejoined; "the Confeſſor "and the benevolence of your nature may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to rejoice, for juſtice no longer has forbade the exerciſe of mercy."</p>
                     <p>"This is all very well in its place," ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa, betrayed by the vexation ſhe ſuffered; ſuch ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and ſuch compliments are like gala ſuits, to be put on in fine weather. My day is cloudy; let me
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:032735_0413_0FF49787FA0B3508"/>
have a little plain ſenſe: inform me of the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which have occaſioned this change in the courſe of your obſervations, and, good father! be brief."</p>
                     <p>Schedoni, then unfolded, with his uſual art, ſuch circumſtances relative to the family of Ellena as he hoped would ſoften the averſion of the Marcheſa to the connection, and incline her in conſideration of her ſon's happineſs, finally to approve it; with which diſcloſure he mingled a plauſible relation of the way, in which the diſcovery had been made.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa's patience would ſcarcely await the concluſion of his narrative, or her diſappointment ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the curb of diſcretion. When at length, he had finiſhed his hiſtory "Is it poſſible," ſaid ſhe, with fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſpleaſure, "that you have ſuffered yourſelf to be deceived by the plauſibility of a girl, who might have been expected to utter any falſhood, which ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear likely to protect her! Has a man of your diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given faith to the idle and improbable tale! Say, rather, father, that your reſolution failed in the criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal moment, and that you are now anxious to form ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes to yourſelf for a conduct ſo puſillanimous."</p>
                     <p>"I am not apt to give an eaſy faith to appearances," replied Schedoni, gravely, "and ſtill leſs to ſhrink from the performance of any act, which I judge to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and juſt. To the laſt intimation, I make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; it does not become my character to vindicate myſelf from an implication of falſhood."</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa, perceiving that her paſſion had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed her into imprudence, condeſcended to apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize for that which ſhe termed an effect of her extreme anxiety, as to what might follow from an act of ſuch indiſcreet indulgence; and Schedoni as willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the apology, each believing the aſſiſtance of the other neceſſary to ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni then informed her, that he had better au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for what he advanced than the aſſertion of
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:032735_0414_0FF497E150C1B410"/>
Ellena; and he mentioned ſome circumſtances, which proved him to he more anxious for the reputation than for the truth of his word. Believing that his origin was entirely unknown to the Marcheſa, he ventured to diſcloſe ſome particulars of Ellena's fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without apprehending that it could lead to a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of his own.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa, though neither appeaſed or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, commanded her feelings ſo far as to appear tranquil, while the Confeſſor repreſented, with the moſt delicate addreſs, the unhappineſs of her ſon, and the ſatisfaction, which muſt finally reſult to herſelf from an acquieſcence with his choice, ſince the object of it was known to be worthy of his alliance. He added, that while he had believed the contrary, he had proved himſelf as ſtrenuous to prevent, as he was now ſincere in approving their marriage; and concluded with gently blameing her for ſuffering prejudice and ſome remains of reſentment to obſcure her excellent underſtanding. "Truſting to the natural clearneſs of your perception," he added, "I doubt not that wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> you have maturely conſidered the ſubject, eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> objection will yield to a conſideration of your ſon's happineſs."</p>
                     <p>The earneſtneſs with which Schedoni pleaded for Vivaldi, excited ſome ſurprize; but the Marcheſa, without condeſcending to reply either to his argument or remonſtrance inquired whether Ellena had a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of the deſign, with which ſhe had been carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the foreſts of the Garganus, or concerning the iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of her perſecutor. Schedoni immediately perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what theſe queſtions tended, replied, with the facility with which he uſually accommodated his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to his intereſt, that Ellena was totally ignorant as to who were her immediate perſecutors, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unſuſpicious of any other evil having been intended her, than that of a temporary confinement.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="125" facs="unknown:032735_0415_0FF49789882A39A8"/>
The laſt aſſertion was admitted by the Marcheſa to be probable, till the boldneſs of the firſt made her doubt the truth of each, and occaſioned her new ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and conjecture as to the motive, which could induce Schedoni to venture theſe untruths. She then inquired where Ellena was now diſpoſed of, but he had too much prudence to diſcloſe the place of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, however plauſible might be the air with which the inquiry was urged; and he endeavoured to call off her attention to Vivaldi. The Confeſſor did not, however, venture, at preſent to give a hint as to the pretended diſcovery of his ſituation in the inquiſition, but reſerved to a more favourable opportunity ſuch mention, together with the zealous offer of his ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to extricate the priſoner. The Marcheſa, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that her ſon was ſtill engaged in purſuit of Ellena, made many inquiries concerning him, but without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing any ſolicitude for his welfare; reſentment ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to be the only emotion ſhe retained towards him. While Schedoni replied with circumſpection to her queſtions, he urged inquiries of his own, as to the manner in which the Marcheſa endured the long abſence of Vivaldi; thus endeavouring to aſcertain how far he might hereafter venture to appear in any efforts for liberating him, and how ſhape his conduct reſpecting Ellena. It ſeemed that the Marcheſe was not indifferent as to his ſon's abſence; and though he had at firſt believed the ſearch for Ellena to have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned it, other apprehenſions now diſturbed him, and taught him the feelings of a father. His numerous avocations and intereſts, however, ſeemed to prevent ſuch anxiety from preying upon his mind; and having diſmiſſed perſons in ſearch of Vivaldi, he paſſed his time in the uſual routine of company and the court. Of the actual ſituation of his ſon, it was evident that neither he, nor the Marcheſa, had th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> leaſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and this was a circumſtance, which the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor was very careful to aſcertain.</p>

                        </gap> Marcheſa with the ſame conſidering air, "in placing the girl in ſuch a ſituation; my ſon cannot fail to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her there."</p>
                     <p>"Or wherever ſhe may be" replied the Confeſſor, believing that he underſtood the Marcheſa's aim, "it may not be poſſible to conceal her long from his ſearch."</p>
                     <p>"The neighbourhood of Naples ought at leaſt to have been avoided," obſerved the Marcheſa,</p>
                     <p>Schedoni was ſilent, and ſhe added, "So near, alſo, to his own reſidence! How far is the <hi>Santa della Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> from the Vivaldi palace?"</p>
                     <p>Though Schedoni had thought that the Marcheſa, while diſplaying a pretended knowledge of Ellena's retreat, was only endeavouring to obtain a real one, this mention of the place of her actual reſidence ſhocked him; but he replied almoſt immediately, "I am ignorant of the diſtance, for, till now, I was unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted that there is a convent of the name you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It appears, however, that this <hi>Santa della Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> is the place, of all other, which ought to have been avoided. How could you ſuſpect me, lady, of imprudence thus extravagant!"</p>
                     <p>While Schedoni ſpoke, the Marcheſa regarded him attentively, and then replied, "I may be allowed, good father, to ſuſpect your prudence in this inſtance,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:032735_0417_0FF4978B0EED7CC8"/>
ſince you have juſt given me ſo unequivocal a proof of it in another."</p>
                     <p>She would then have changed the ſubject but, Schedoni, believing this inclination to be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of her having aſſured herſelf, that ſhe had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually diſcovered Ellena's aſylum, and too reaſonably ſuſpecting the dreadful uſe ſhe deſigned to make of the diſcovery, endeavoured to unſettle her opinion, and miſlead her as to the place of Ellena's abode. He not only contradicted the fact of her preſent reſidence at the <hi>Santa della Pieta,</hi> but, without ſcruple, made a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive aſſertion, that ſhe was at a diſtance from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, nameing at the ſame time, a fictious place, whoſe obſcurity, he added, would be the beſt protection from the purſuit of Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Very true, father," obſerved the Marcheſa; "I believe that my ſon will not readily diſcover the girl in the place you have named."</p>
                     <p>Whether the Marcheſa believed Schedoni's aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or not, ſhe expreſſed no farther curioſity on the ſubject, and appeared conſiderably more tranquil than before. She now chatted with eaſe on general topics, while the Confeſſor dared no more to urge the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his ſecret wiſhes; and having ſupported for ſome time, a converſation moſt uncongenial with his temper, he took his leave, and returned to Naples. On the way thither, he reviewed with exactneſs, the late behaviour of the Marcheſa, and the reſult of this examination was a reſolution—never to renew the ſubject of their converſation, but to ſolemnize, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her conſent, the nuptials of Vivaldi and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſa, meanwhile, on the departure of Schedoni, remained in the attitude in which he had left her, and abſorbed by the intereſt, which his viſit excited. The ſudden change in his conduct no leſs aſtoniſhed and perplexed, than diſappointed her, She
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:032735_0418_0FF497EE1F525368"/>
could not explain it by the ſuppoſition of any princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or motive. Sometimes it occurred to her, that Vivaldi had bribed him with rich promiſes, to promote the marriage, which he contributed to thwart; but, when ſhe conſidered the high expectations ſhe had herſelf encouraged him to cheri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n, the improbability of the conjecture was apparent. That Schedoni, from whatever cauſe, was no longer to be truſted in this buſineſs, was ſufficiently clear, but ſhe endeavoured to conſole herſelf with a hope that a more confidential perſon might yet be diſcovered. A part of Schedoni's reſolution ſhe alſo adopted, which was, never again to introduce the ſubject of their late converſation. But while ſhe ſhould ſilently purſue her own plans, ſhe determined to conduct herſelf, towards Schedoni i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>ELLENA, obedient to the command of Schedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, withdrew from her home on the day that followed her arrival there, to the <hi>Santa della Pieta.</hi> The Superior, who had known her from her infancy, and from the acquaintance which ſuch long obſervation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded, had both eſteemed and loved her, received El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena with a degree of ſatisfaction proportionate to the concern ſhe had ſuffered when informed of her diſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous removal from the Villa Altieri.</p>
                     <p>Among the quiet groves of this convent, however, Ellena vainly endeavoured to moderate her ſolicitude reſpecting the ſituation of Vivaldi; for, now that ſhe had a reſpite from immediate calamity, ſhe thought with more intenſe anxiety as to what might be his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and her fears and impatience encreaſed, as each day diſappointed her expectation of intelligence from Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>If the ſoothings of ſympathy and the delicate arts of benevolence could have reſtored the ſerenity of her mind, Ellena would now have been peaceful; for all theſe were offered her by the abbeſs and the ſiſters of the <hi>Santa della Pieta.</hi> They were not acquainted

with the cauſe of her ſorrow, but they perceived that, ſhe was unhappy, and wiſhed her to be otherwiſe. The ſociety of <hi>Our Lady of Pity,</hi> was ſuch as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent does not often ſhroud; to the wiſdom and virtu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Whatever might be her failings they were effectually concealed by the general benevolence of her heart, and the harmony of her mind; a harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, not the effect of torpid feelings, but the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of correct and vigilant judgment. Her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was neither gloomy nor bigotted; it was the ſentiment of a grateful heart offering itſelf up to a Deity, who delights in the happineſs of his creatures and ſhe conformed to the cuſtoms of the Roman church without ſuppoſing a faith in all of them to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation. This opinion, however, ſhe was obliged to conceal, leſt her very virtue ſhould draw upon her the puniſhment of a crime, from ſome fierce eccleſiaſtics, who contradicted in their practice the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eſſential principles, which the chriſtianity they profeſſed would have taught them.</p>
                     <p>In her lectures to the nuns ſhe ſeldom touched upon points of faith, but explained and enforced the moral
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:032735_0421_0FF49796F6008238"/>
duties, particularly ſuch as were moſt practicable in the ſociety to which ſhe belonged; ſuch as tended to ſoften and harmonize the affections, to impart that repoſe of mind, which perſuades to the practice of ſiſterly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, univerſal charity, and the moſt pure and elevated devotion. When ſhe ſpoke of religion, it appeared ſo intereſting, ſo beautiful, that her attentive auditors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and loved it as a friend, a refiner of the heart, a ſublime conſoler; and experienced ſomewhat of the meek and holy ardour, which may belong to angelic natures.</p>
                     <p>The ſociety appeared like a large family, of which the lady abbeſs was the mother, rather than an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blage of ſtrangers: and particularly when gathered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round her, they liſtened to the evening ſermon, which ſhe delivered with ſuch affectionate, intereſt, ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive eloquence, and ſometimes with ſuch pathetic energy, as few hearts could reſiſt.</p>
                     <p>She encouraged in her convent every innocent and liberal purſuit, which might ſweeten the auſterities of confinement, and which were generally rendered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to charity. The <hi>Daughters of Pity</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly excelled in muſic; not in thoſe difficulties of the art, which diſplay florid graces, and intricate exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but in ſuch eloquence of ſound as ſteals upon the heart, and awakens its ſweeteſt and beſt affections. It was probably the well regulated ſenſibility of their own minds, that enabled theſe ſiſters to diffuſe, through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Bianchi, with all the ſportive years of her child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and where ſome of her happieſt hours had been paſſed in the ſociety of Vivaldi. Along the windings of the coaſt, too, ſhe could diſtinguiſh many places rendered ſacred by affection, to which ſhe had made excurſions with her lamented relative and Vivaldi; and though ſadneſs mingled with the recollections a view of them reſtored, they were precious to her heart. Here, alone and unobſerved, ſhe frequently yielded to the melancholy which ſhe endeavoured to ſuppreſs in ſociety; and at other times tried to deceive, with books and pencil, the lingering moments of uncertainty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſtate of Vivaldi; for day after day ſtill elap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed without bringing any intelligence from Schedoni. Whenever the late ſcenes connected with the diſcovery of her family recurred to Ellena, ſhe was ſtruck with almoſt as much amazement as if ſhe was gazing upon a viſion, inſtead of recalling realities. Contraſted with the ſober truth of her preſent life, the paſt appeared like romance; and there were moments when ſhe ſhrunk from the relationſhip of Schedoni with unconquera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affright. The firſt emotions his appearance had excited were ſo oppoſite to thoſe of filial tenderneſs, that ſhe perceived it was now nearly impoſſible to love and revere him as her father, and ſhe endeavoured, by dwelling upon all the obligations, which ſhe believed he had lately conferred upon her, to repay him a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, what was withheld in affection.</p>
                     <p>In ſuch melancholy conſiderations, ſhe often linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the ſhade of the accacias, till the ſun had ſunk behind the far diſtant promontory of Miſeno<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the laſt bell of veſpers ſummoned her to the convent below.</p>
                     <p>Among the nuns, Ellena had many favourites, but not one that ſhe admired and loved equally with Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via of San Stefano, the remembrance of whom was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accompanied with a fear leſt ſhe ſhould have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:032735_0424_0FF497FB853BDFD0"/>
from her generous compaſſion, and a wiſh that ſhe had taken up her abode with the happy ſociety of the <hi>Daughters of pity</hi> inſtead of being ſubjected to the tyranny of the abbeſs of San Stefano. To Ellena, the magnificent ſcenes of the <hi>Santa della Pieta</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to open a ſecure, and perhaps a laſt aſylum; for, is her preſent circumſtances, ſhe could not avoid perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how menancing and various were the objections to her marriage with Vivaldi, even ſhould Schedoni prove propitious to it. The character of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa di Vivaldi, ſuch as it ſtood unfolded by the late occurrences, ſtruck her with diſmay, for her deſigns appeared ſufficiently atrocious, whether they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the utmoſt limit of Ellena's ſuſpicions, or had ſtopped where the affected charity of Schedoni had pointed out. In either caſe, the pertinacity of her averſion, and the vindictive violence of her nature, were obvious. In this view of her character, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it was not the inconvenience threatened to thoſe who might become connected with her, that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally affected Ellena, but the circumſtance of ſuch a woman being the mother of Vivaldi; and to alleviate ſo afflicting a conſideration, ſhe endeavourd to believe all the palliating ſuggeſtions of Schedoni, reſpecting the Marcheſa's late intentions. But if Ellena was griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on diſcovering crime, in the character of Vivaldi's parent, what would have been her ſuffering, had ſhe ſuſpected the nature of Schedoni?—what, if ſhe had been told that he was the adviſer of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſa's plans?—if ſhe had known that he had been the partner of her intentional guilt? From ſuch ſuffering ſhe was yet ſpared, as well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as from that which a knowledge of Vivaldi's preſent ſituation and of the reſult of Schedoni's efforts to procure a releaſe from the perils, among which he had preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated him, would have inflicted.

mind, ſhe would have relinquiſhed what is called the world, and ſought a laſting aſylum with the ſociety of the holy ſiſters. Even as it was, ſhe ſometimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to look with reſignation upon the events which might render ſuch a ſtep deſirable; but it was an effort that ſeldom ſoothed her even with a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary ſelf-deluſion. Should the veil, however, prove her final refuge, it would be by her own choice; for the lady abbeſs of the <hi>Santa della Pieta</hi> employed no art to win a recluſe, nor ſuffered the nuns to ſeduce votaries to the order.</p>

                     <p>WHILE the late events had been paſſing in the Garganus, and at Naples, Vivaldi and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Paulo, remained impriſoned in diſtinct chambers of the Inquiſition. They were again ſeparately inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated. From the ſervant no information could be obtained; he aſſerted only his maſter's innocence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out once remembring to mention his own; clamoured, with more juſtice than prudence, againſt the perſons who had occaſioned his arreſt; ſeriouſly endeavouring to convince the inquiſitors, that he himſelf had <hi>no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> in having demanded to be brought to theſe priſons than that he might comfort his maſter, he gravely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated on the injuſtice of ſeparating them, adding, that he was ſure when they knew the rights of the matter, they would order him to be carried to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Signor Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"I do aſſure your <hi>Sereniſſimo Illuſtruſſimo,</hi>" contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Paulo, addreſſing the chief inquiſitor with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found gravity, "that this is the laſt place I ſhould have thought of coming to, on any other account; and if you will only condeſcend to aſk your officials, who took my maſter up, they will tell you <hi>as g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Paulo was permitted to harangue in his own way,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:032735_0427_0FF4979FB423E680"/>
becauſe his examiners hoped that his prolixity would be a means of betraying circumſtances connected with his maſter. By this veiw, however, they were miſled, for Paulo, with all his ſimplicity of heart, was both vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and ſhrewd in Vivaldi's intereſt. But, when he perceived them really convinced, that his ſole motive for viſiting the Inquiſition was that he might conſole his maſter, yet ſtill perſiſting in the reſolution of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately confining him, his indignation knew no bounds. He depiſed alike their reprehenſion, their thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing menaces, and their more artful exhibitions; told them of all they had to expect both here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, for their cruelty to his dear maſter, and ſaid they might do what they would with him; he defied them to make him more miſerable than he was.</p>
                     <p>It was not without difficulty that he was removed from the chamber, where he left his examiners in a ſtate of aſtoniſhment at his raſhneſs, and indignation of his honeſty, ſuch as they had, probably never experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced before.</p>
                     <p>When Vivaldi was again called up to the table of the Holy Office, he underwent a longer examination than on a former occaſion. Several inquiſitors atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and every art was employed to induce him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs crimes, of which he was ſuſpected, and to draw from him a diſcovery of others which might have elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded even ſuſpicion. Still the examiners cautiouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided informing him of the ſubject of the accuſation on which he had been arreſted, and it was, therefore, only on the former aſſurances of the Benedictine, and the officials in the chaple of San Sebaſtian, that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid underſtood he was accuſed of having carried off a nun. His anſwers on the preſent occaſion were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and firm, and his whole deportment undaunted. He felt leſs apprehenſion for himſelf, than indignation of the general injuſtice and cruelty, which the tribunal was permitted to exerciſe upon others; and this virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:032735_0428_0FF497FE95CAA4D0"/>
indignation gave a loftineſs, a calm heroic gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duer to his mind, which never, for a moment, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>On this, his ſecond examination, he was urged by the ſame dark queſtions, and replied to them with the ſame open ſincerity, as during the firſt. Yet the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and energy of truth failed to impreſs conviction on minds, which, no longer poſſeſſing the virtue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, were not competent to underſtand the ſymptom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>On the way to this dreadful abode, a perſon paſſed him in one of the avenues, of whoſe air and figure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> thought he had ſome recollection; and, as the ſtranger ſtalked away, he ſuddenly knew him to be the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic monk, who had haunted him among the ruins of Paluzzi. In the firſt moment of ſurpriſe, Vivaldi loſt his preſence of mind ſo far, that he made no attempt to interrupt him. In the next inſtance, however, he pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and looked back, with an intention of ſpeaking; but this myſterious perſon was already at the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the avenue. Vivaldi called, and beſought him to ſtop. Without either ſpeaking or turning his head, however, he immediately diſappeared beyond a door that opened at his approach. Vivaldi on attempting to take the way of the monk, was withheld by his guards, and, when he inquired who was the ſtranger he had ſeen, the officials aſked, in their turn, what ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he alluded to.</p>
                     <p>"He who has juſt paſſed us," replied Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>The officials ſeemed ſurprized, "Your ſpirits are diſordered, Signor," obſerved one of them, "I ſaw no perſon paſs!</p>
                     <p>"He paſſed ſo cloſely," ſaid Vivaldi, "that it was hardly poſſible you could avoid ſeeing him!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="139" facs="unknown:032735_0429_0FF497A2298C7598"/>
"I did not even hear a footſtep!" added the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>"I do not recollect that I did," anſwered Vivaldi, "but I ſaw his figure as plainly as I now ſee your's; his black garments almoſt touched me! Was he an inquiſitor?"</p>
                     <p>The official appeared aſtoniſhed; and, whether his ſurprize was real, or affected for the purpoſe of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his knowledge of the perſon alluded to, his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment and awe ſeemed natural. Vivaldi obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with almoſt equal curioſity and ſurprize, the fear which his face expreſſed; but perceived alſo, that it would avail nothing to repeat his queſtions.</p>
                     <p>As they proceeded along the avenue, a kind of half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifled groan was ſometimes audible from a diſtance. "Whence come theſe ſounds?" ſaid Vivaldi, "they ſtrike to my heart!"</p>
                     <p>"They ſhould do ſo," replied the guard.</p>
                     <p>"Whence come they?" repeated Vivaldi, more impatiently, and ſhuddering.</p>
                     <p>"From the place of torture," ſaid the official.</p>
                     <p>"O God! O God!" exclaimed Vivaldi, with a deep groan,</p>
                     <p>He paſſed with haſty ſteps the door of that terrible chamber, and the guard did not attempt to ſtop him. The officials had brought him, in obedience to the cuſtomary orders they had received, within hearing of thoſe doleful ſounds for the purpoſe of impreſſing upon his mind the horrors of the puniſhment, with which he was threatened, and of inducing him to confeſs without incurring them.</p>
                     <p>On the ſame evening, Vivaldi was viſited, in his priſon, by a man whom he had never conſciouſly ſeen before. He appeared to be between forty and fifty; was of a grave and obſervant phyſiognomy, and of manners, which, though ſomewhat auſtere, were not alarming. The account he gave of himſelf, and of his
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:032735_0430_0FF498001D3ECD18"/>
motive for this viſit, was curious. He ſaid that he alſo was a priſoner in the inquiſition, but, as the ground of accuſation againſt him was light, he had been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured ſo far as to be allowed ſome degree of liberty within certain bounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that, having heard of Vivaldi's ſituation, he had aſked and obtained leave to converſe with him, which he had done in compaſſion, &amp; with a deſire of aſſuaging his ſufferings, ſo far as an expreſſion of ſympathy and commiſeration might relieve them.</p>
                     <p>While he ſpoke, Vivaldi regarded him with deep at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and the improbability that thoſe pretenſion ſhould be true, did not eſcape him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the ſuſpicion which they occaſioned he prudently concealed. The ſtranger converſed on various ſubjects. Vivaldi's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers were cautious and conciſe; but not even long pauſes of ſilence wearied the compaſſionate patience of his viſitor. Among other topics, he, at length, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced that of religion.</p>
                     <p>"I have myſelf, been accuſed of hereſy," ſaid he, "and know how to pity others in the ſame ſituation,"</p>
                     <p>"It is of hereſy, then, that I am accuſed!" inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Vivaldi, "of hereſy!"</p>
                     <p>"It availed me nothing that I aſſerted my innocence," continued the ſtranger, without noticing Vivaldi's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, "I was condemned to the torture. My ſufferings were too terrible to be endured! I confeſſed my offence—"</p>
                     <p>"Pardon me," interrupted Vivaldi, "but allow me to obſerve, that ſince your ſufferings were ſo ſevere, your's againſt whom the ground of accuſation was light, what may be the puniſhment of thoſe, whoſe offences are more ſerious!"</p>
                     <p>The ſtranger was ſomewhat embarraſſed. "My offence was ſlight," he continued, without giving a full anſwer.</p>
                     <p>"Is it poſſible," ſaid Vivaldi, again interrupting him, "that hereſy can be conſidered as a ſlight offence before the tribunal of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

"It was only of a ſlight degree of hereſy," replied he viſitor, reddening with diſpleaſure, "that I was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi remained ſilent, while he examined, with cloſer attention, the countenance of his viſitor. It was of he utmoſt importance to him, that his family ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e made acquainted with his ſituation; yet he knew not exactly how to interpret, or to confide in this offer. Vivaldi had heard that informers ſometimes viſited the priſoners, and, under the affectation of kindneſs and ſympathy, drew from them a confeſſion of opinions, which were afterwards urged againſt them; and obtained diſcoveries relative to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections and friends, who were, by theſe inſidious means, frequently involved in their deſtruction. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, conſcious of his own innocence, had on his firſt examination, acquainted the inquiſitor with the names and reſidence of his family; he had, therefore. nothing new to apprehend from revealing them to this ſtranger; but he perceived that if it ſhould be known he had attempted to convey a meſſage, however con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and harmleſs, the diſcovery would irritate the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous inquiſitors againſt him, and might be urged as a new preſumption of his guilt. Theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:032735_0432_0FF4980C78AFAC48"/>
together with the diſtruſt which the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of his viſitor's aſſertions, and the occaſional embarraſſment of his manner, had awakened, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined Vivaldi to reſiſt the temptation now offered to him; and the ſtranger, having received his thanks, reluctantly withdrew, obſerving however, that ſhould any unforeſeen circumſtance detain him in the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition longer than he had reaſon to expect, he ſhould beg leave to pay him another viſit. In reply to this, Vivaldi only bowed, but he remarked, that the ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's countenance changed, and that ſome dark brood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appeared to cloud his mind, as he quitted the chamber.</p>
                     <p>Several days elapſed, during which Vivaldi heard no more of his new acquaintance.

cold damps, which hung on his forehead, betrayed the agony of his mind. It was not long, however, that he ſuffered from a ſenſe of ignominy; his better judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhewed him, that innocence cannot ſuffer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace from any ſituation or circumſtance, and he once more reſumed the courage and the firmneſs which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to virtue.</p>
                     <p>It was about midnight, that Vivaldi heard ſteps approaching, and a murmer of voices at the door of his cell. He underſtood theſe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e the perſons come to ſummon him to the torture. The door was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred, and two men, habited in black, appeared at it. Without ſpeaking, they advanced, and throwing over him a ſingular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> kind of mantle, led him from the chamber.</p>
                     <p>Along the galleries, and other avenues through which they paſſed, not any perſon was ſeen, and, by the profound ſtillneſs that reigned, it ſeemed as if death had already anticipated his work in theſe regions of horror, and had condemned alike the tortured and the torturer.</p>
                     <p>They deſcended to the large hall, where Vivaldi had waited on the night of his entrance, and thence through an avenue, and down a long flight of ſteps that led to ſubterranean chambers. His conductors did not utter a ſyllable during the whole progreſs; Vivaldi knew too well that queſtions would only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him to greater ſeverity, and he aſked none.</p>
                     <p>The doors, through which they paſſed, regularly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at the touch of an iron rod, carried by one of the officials, and without the appearance of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

                     <p>Having waited a conſiderable time, during which the official did not repeat the ſignal, the door was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened by a perſon whom Vivaldi could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh in the gloom beyond, and with whom one of his conductors communicated by ſigns; after whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Several minutes had elapſed, when tones of deep voices arouſed the attention of Vivaldi. They were loud and hoarſe, and ſpoke in a language unknown to him. At the ſounds, the official immediately extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed his torch. The voices drew nearer, and, the door again unfolding, two figures ſtood before Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, which ſhewn by a glimmering light within ſtruck him with aſtoniſhment and diſmay. The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Their faces were entirely concealed beneath a very peculiar kind of cowl, which deſcended from the head to the feet; and their eyes only were viſible through ſmall openings contrived for the ſight. It occured to Vivaldi that theſe men were torturers their appearance was worthy of demons. Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they were thus habited, that the perſons whom they afflicted might not know them; or, perhaps, it was only for the purpoſe of ſtriking terror upon the minds of the accuſed, and thus compelling them to confeſs without further difficulty. Whatever motive might have occaſioned their horriſic appearance, and whatever was their office, Vivaldi was delivered into
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:032735_0435_0FF497B0664EEA50"/>
their hands, and, in the ſame moment, heard the iron door ſhut which encloſed him with them in a narrow paſſage, gloomily lighted by a lamp ſuſpended from the arched roof. They walked in ſilence on each ſide of their priſoner, and came to a ſecond door which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them inſtantly into another paſſage. A third door, at a ſhort diſtance; admitted them to a third a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, at the end of which, one of his myſterious guides ſtruck upon a gate, and they ſtopped. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain ſounds that Vivaldi had fancied he heard, were now more audible, and he diſtinguiſhed, with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible horror, that they were uttered by perſons ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</p>
                     <p>The gate was at length opened by a figure habited like his conductors, and two other doors of iron, placed very near each other, being alſo unlocked, Vivaldi found himſelf in a ſpacious chamber, the walls of which were hung with black, duſkily lighted by lamps that gleamed in the lofty vault. Immediately on his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, a ſtrange ſound ran along the walls, and echoed among other vaults, that appeared, by the progreſs of the ſound, to extend far beyond this.</p>
                     <p>It was not immediately that Vivaldi could ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recollect himſelf to obſerve any object before him; and even when he did ſo, the gloom of the place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his aſcertaining many appearances. Shadowy countenances and uncertain forms ſeemed to flit through the duſk, and many inſtruments, the application of which he did not comprehend, ſtruck him with horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuſpicions. Still he heard, at intervals, half ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed groans, and was looking round to diſcover the wretched people from whom they were extorted, when a voice from a remote part of the chamber, called on him to advance.</p>
                     <p>The diſtance, and the obſcurity of the ſpot whence the voice iſſued, had prevented Vivaldi from noticing any perſon there, and he was now ſlowly obeying, when

on a ſecond ſummons, his conductors ſeized his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>In a remoet part of this extenſive chamber, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived three perſons ſeated under a black canopy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Below, at a table, ſat a ſecretary, over whom was ſuſpended, the only lamp that could enable him to commit to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per what ſhould occur during the examination. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi now underſtood, that the three perſons who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the tribunal were the vicar-general, or grand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor, the advocate of the exchequer, and an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inquiſitor, who was ſeated between the other two and who appeared more eagerly to engage in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his cruel office. A portentious obſcurity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velloped alike their perſons and their proceedings.</p>
                     <p>At ſome diſtance from the tribunal ſtood a large i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron frame, which Vivaldi conjectured to be the rack, and near it another, reſembling, in ſhape, a coffin but, happily, he could not diſtinguiſh through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote obſcurity, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> perſon undergoing actual ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In the vaults beyond, however, the diabolical decrees of the inquiſitors ſeemed to be fulfilling; for whenever a diſtant door opened for a moment, ſounds of lamentation iſſued forth, and men whom he judges to be familiars, habited like thoſe who ſtood beſide him were ſeen paſſing to and fro within.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi almoſt believed himſelf in the infernal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions; the diſmal aſpect of this place, the horrible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for puniſhment, and, above all, the diſpoſition and appearance of the perſons that were ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict it, confirmed the reſemblance. That any human being, ſhould afflict a fellow being who had never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, or even offended him; that, unſwayed by paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſhould deliberately become the means of tortur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, appeared to Vivaldi nearly incredible! But
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:032735_0437_0FF497B1ED8F0A48"/>
when he looked at the three perſons who compoſed the tribunal, and conſidered that they had not only volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily undertaken the cruel office they fulfilled, but had probably long regarded it as the ſummit of their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his aſtoniſhment &amp; indignation were unbounded.</p>
                     <p>The grand inquiſitor having again called on Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di by name, admoniſhed him to confeſs the truth, and avoid the ſuffering that awaited him.</p>
                     <p>As Vivaldi had, on former examinations, ſpoken the truth, which was not believed, he had no chance of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping preſent ſuffering, but by aſſerting falſhood: in doing ſo, to avoid ſuch monſtrous injuſtice and cruelty he might, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>erhaps, have been juſtified, had it been cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that ſuch aſſertion could affect himſelf alone; but ſince he knew that the conſequence muſt extend to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and above all, believed that Ellena di Roſalba muſt be involv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d in it, he did not heſitate for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, to dare whatever torture his firmneſs might provoke. But even if morality could have forgiven falſhood in ſuch extraordinary circumſtances as theſe, policy, after all, would have forbidden it, ſince a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the artifice would probably have led to the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſtruction of the accuſed perſon.</p>
                     <p>Of Ellena's ſituation he would now have aſked, however deſperate the queſtion; would again have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted her innocence, and ſupplicated for compaſſion, even to inquiſitors, had he not perceived that, in doing ſo, he ſhould only furniſh them with a more exquiſite means of torturing him than any other they could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; for if, when all the terrors of his ſoul concerning her were underſtood, they ſhould threaten to increaſe her ſufferings, as the puniſhment of what was termed his obſtinacy, they would, indeed, become maſters of his integrity, as well as of his perſon.</p>
                     <p>The tribunal again, and repeatedly, urged Vivaldi to confeſs himſelf guilty; and the inquiſitor, at length concluded, with ſaying that the judges were innocent

of whatever conſequence might enſue from his ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>"I am innocent of the charges which I underſtand are urged againſt me; ſaid Vivald, with ſolemnity. "I repeat, that I am innocent! If to eſcape the horror of theſe moments, I could be weak enough to declare myſelf guilty, not all your racks could alter truth, and make me ſo, except in that aſſertion. The conſequence of your tortures, therefore, be upon your own heads!</p>
                     <p>While Vivaldi ſpoke, the vicar-general liſtened with attention, and when he had ceaſed to ſpeak, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to meditate; but the inquiſitor was irritated by the boldneſs of his ſpeech, inſtead of being convinced by the juſtneſs of his repreſentation and made a ſignal for the officers to prepare for the queſtion. While they were obeyiug, Vivaldi obſerved, notwithſtanding the agitation he ſuffered. a perſon croſs the chamber, whom he immediately knew to be the ſame that had paſſed him in the avenue of the inquiſition on a formernight, and whom he had then fancied to be the myſterious ſtranger of Paluzzi. Vivaldi now fixed his eyes upon him, but his own peculiar ſituation prevented his fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the intereſt he had formerly ſuffered concerning him.</p>
                     <p>The figure, air, and ſtalk, of this perſon were ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and ſo ſtrongly reſembled thoſe of the monk of Paluzzi, that Vivaldi had no longer a doubt as to their identity. He pointed him out to one of the officials, and enquired who he was. While he ſpoke, the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was paſſing forward, and, before any reply was given, a door leading to the farther vaults ſhut him from veiw. Vivaldi, however, repeated the inquiry which the official appeared unable to anſwer, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof from the tribunal reminded him that he muſt not aſk queſtions there. Vivaldi obſerved it was the grand Inquiſitor who ſpoke, and that the manner <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The familiars, who were the ſame that had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted Vivaldi into the chamber, having made ready the inſtrument of torture, approached him, and after taking off his cloak and veſt, bound him with ſtrong cords. They threw over his head the cuſtomary black garment, which entirely enveloped his figure, and prevented his obſerving what was farther prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In this ſtate of expectation, he was again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogated by the inquiſitor.</p>
                     <p>"Was you ever in the church of the Spirito Santo at Naples?" ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>"Yes," replied Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Did you ever expreſs there, a contempt for the Catholic faith?"</p>
                     <p>"Never," ſaid Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Neither by word or action?" continued the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor.</p>
                     <p>"Never, by either!"</p>
                     <p>"Recollect yourſelf," added the inquiſitor. "Did you never inſult there, a miniſter of our moſt holy church?"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi was ſilent: he began to perceive the real nature of the charge which was to be urged againſt him, and that it was too plauſible to permit his eſcape from the puniſhment, which is adjudged for hereſy. Queſtions ſo direct and minute had never been put to him here on his former examinations; they had been reſerved for a moment when it was believed he could not evade them; and the real charge had been conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him, that he might not be prepared to elude it.</p>
                     <p>"Anſwer," repeated the inquiſitor.—</p>
                     <p>"Did you ever inſult a miniſter of the Catholic faith, in the church of the Spirito Santo, at Naples?"</p>
                     <p>"Did you not inſult him while he was performing an act of holy penance?" ſaid another voice.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi ſtarted, for he inſtantly recollected the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known

tones of the monk of Paluzzi. "Who aſks the queſtion?" demanded Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"It is you who are to anſwer here," reſumed the inquiſitor. "Anſwer to what I have required."</p>
                     <p>"I have offended a miniſter of the church," replied Vivaldi, "but never could intentionally inſult our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly religion. You are not acquainted, fathers, with the injuries that provoked—"</p>
                     <p>"Enough!" interrupted the inquiſitor; "ſpeak to the queſtion. Did you not, by inſult and menace, force a pious brother to leave unperformed, the act of penance in which he had engaged himſelf? Did you not compel him to quit the church, and fly for refuge to his convent?"</p>
                     <p>"No," replied Vivaldi. "Tis true, he left the church, and that in conſequence of my conduct there; but the conſequence was not neceſſary; if he had only replied to my enquiry, or promiſed to reſtore her, of whom he had treacherouſly robbed me, he might have remained quietly in the church till this moment, had that depended upon my forbearance."</p>
                     <p>"What!" ſaid the vicar-general, "would you have compelled him to ſpeak, when he was engaged in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent penance? You confeſs, that you occaſioned him to leave the church. That is enough."</p>

"Let the ſame perſon aſk it," replied Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>The queſtion was repeated in the former voice,</p>

                     <p>"The name of the monk? ſaid the ſtranger, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly.</p>
                     <p>"If I miſtake not," replied Vivaldi, "you are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready acquainted with it. The monk is called father Schedoni. He is of the Dominican convent of the Spirito Sancto, in Naples, and the ſame who accuſes me of having inſulted him in the church of that name."</p>
                     <p>"How did you know him for your accuſer?" aſked the ſame voice.</p>
                     <p>"Becauſe he is my only enemy," replied Vivaldi.</p>

                     <p>"You were warned not to viſit Villa Altieri," ſaid the unknown perſon. "Why did you not profit by the warning?"</p>
                     <p>"I was warned by yourſelf," anſwered Vivaldi. "Now I know you well."</p>

                        <pb n="152" facs="unknown:032735_0442_0FF4981CC4955700"/>
"By me!" ſaid the ſtranger, in a ſolemn tone.</p>
                     <p>"By you!" repeated Vivaldi; "you who al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>"Whence come theſe queſtions?" demanded the vicar general. "Who has been authoriſed thus to interrogate the priſoner?"</p>
                     <p>No reply was made. A buſy hum of voices from the tribunal ſucceeded the ſilence. At length the murmuring ſubſided, and the monk's voice was heard again.</p>
                     <p>"I will declare thus much," it ſaid, addreſſing Vivaldi; "I am not father Schedoni."</p>
                     <p>The peculiar tone and emphaſis, with which this was delivered, more than the aſſertion itſelf, perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Vivaldi that the ſtranger ſpoke truth; and, though he ſtill recognized the voice of the monk of Paluzzi, he did not know it to be that of Sche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oni. Vivaldi was aſtoniſhed! He would have torn the veil from his eyes, and once more viewed the myſterious ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, had his hands been at liberty. As it was, he could only conjure him to reveal his name, and the motives for his former conduct.</p>
                     <p>"Who is come among us?" ſaid the vicar general, in the voice of a perſon who means to inſpire in others the awe he himſelf ſuffers.</p>
                     <p>"Who is come amongſt us?" he repeated in a loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er tone. Still no anſwer was returned; but again a confuſed murmur ſounded from the tribunal, and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conſternation ſeemed to prevail. No perſon ſpoke with ſufficient pre-eminence to be underſtood by Vivaldi; ſomething extraordinary appeared to be paſſing, and he awaited the iſſue with all the patience he could command. Soon after he heard doors open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the noiſe of perſons quitting the chamber. A deep ſilence followed; but he was certain that the
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:032735_0443_0FF4987466947318"/>
familiars were ſtill beſide him, waiting to begin their work of torture.</p>
                     <p>After a conſiderable time had elapſed, Vivaldi heard footſteps advancing, and a perſon give orders for his releaſe, that he might be carried back to his cell.</p>
                     <p>When the veil was removed from his eyes, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the tribunal was diſſolved, and that the ſtranger was gone. The lamps were dying away, and the chamber appeared more gloomily terrific than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>The familiars conducted him to the ſpot at which they had received him; whence the officers who had led him thither, guarded him to his priſon. There, ſtretched upon his bed of ſtraw, in ſolitude and in darkneſs, he had leiſure enough to reflect upon what had paſſed, and to recollect with minute exactneſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very former circumſtance connected with the ſtranger. By comparing thoſe with the preſent, he endeavoured to draw a more certain concluſion as to the identity of this perſon, and his motives for the very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conduct he had purſued, The firſt appearance of this ſtranger, among the ruins of Paluzzi, when he had ſaid that Vivaldi's ſteps were watched, and had cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned him againſt returning to the villa Altieri, was recalled to his mind. Vivaldi re-conſidered, alſo, his ſecond appearance on the ſame ſpot, and his ſecond warning; the circumſtances, which had attended his own adventures within the fortreſs;—the monk's prediction of Bianchi's death, and his evil tidings reſpecting Ellena, at the very hour when ſhe had been ſeized and carried from her home. The longer he conſidered theſe ſeveral inſtances, as they were now connected in his mind, with the certainty of Schedoni's evil diſpoſition towards him, the more he was inclined to believe, notwithſtanding the voice of ſeeming truth which had juſt affirmed the contrary, that the unknown perſon was Schedoni himſelf, and
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:032735_0444_0FF4981E4B73D2E0"/>
that he had been employed by the Marcheſa, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Vivaldi's viſits to the villa Altieri. Being thus an agent in the events of which he had warned Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, he was too well enabled to predict them, Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di pauſed upon the remembrance of Signora Bianchi's death; he conſidered the extraordinary and dubious circumſtances that had attended it, and ſhuddered as a new conjecture croſſed his mind—The thought was too dreadful to be permitted, and he diſmiſſed it inſtantly.</p>
                     <p>Of the converſation, however, which he had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards held with the Confeſſor in the Marcheſa's ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, he recollected many particulars that ſerved to renew his doubts as to the identity of the Stranger; the behaviour of Schedoni when he was obliquely chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged for the monk of Paluzzi, ſtill appeared that of a man unconſcious of diſguiſe; and above all, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi was ſtruck with the ſeeming candour of his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pointed out a circumſtance, which removed the probability that the ſtranger was a brother of the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta della Pianto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some particulars, alſo, of the ſtranger's conduct did not agree with what might have been expected from Schedoni, even though the Confeſſor had really been Vivaldi's enemy; a circumſtance which the latter was no longer permitted to doubt. Nor did thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular circumſtances accord, as he was inclined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, with the manner of a being of this world; and when Vivaldi conſidered the ſuddenneſs and myſtery, with which the ſtranger had always appeared and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, he felt diſpoſed to adopt again one of his earlieſt conjectures, which undoubtedly the horrors of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent abode diſpoſed his imagination to admit, as thoſe of his former ſituation in the vaults of Paluzzi, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a youthful glow of curioſity concerning the marvellous, had before contributed to impreſs them upon his mind.</p>
                     <p>He concluded his preſent reflections as he had began
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:032735_0445_0FF49875EEA25AC0"/>
them—in doubt and perplexity; but at length found a reſpite from thought and from ſuffering in ſleep.</p>
                     <p>Midnight had been paſſed in the vaults of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition: but it was probably not yet two o'clock, when he was imperfectly awakened by a ſound, which he fancied proceeded from within his chamber. He raiſed himſelf to diſcover what had occaſioned the noiſe; it was, however, impoſſible to diſcern any object, for all was dark, but he liſtened for a return of the ſound. The wind only was heard moaning among the inner buildings of the priſon, and Vivaldi concluded, that his dream had mocked him with a mimic voice,</p>
                     <p>Satisfied with this concluſion, he again laid his head on his pillow of ſtraw, and ſoon ſunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſlumber. The ſubject of his waking thoughts ſtill haunted his imagination, and the ſtranger, whoſe voice he had this night recognized as that of the monk of Paluzzi, appeared before him. Vivaldi, on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the figure of this unknown, felt, perhaps, near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame degrees of awe, curioſity, and impatience that he would have ſuffered, had he beheld the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſhadow. The monk, whoſe face was ſtill ſhrowded, he thought advanced, till, having come within a few paces of Vivaldi, he pauſed, and lifting the awful cowl that had hitherto concealed him, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed—not the countenance of Schedoni, but one of which Vivaldi did not recollect ever having ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore! It was not leſs intereſting to curioſity, than ſtriking to the feelings. Vivaldi at the firſt glance ſhrunk back;—ſomething of that ſtrange and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable air, which we attach to the idea of a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural being, prevailed over the features; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe and fiery eyes reſembled thoſe of an evil ſpirit, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than of a human character. He drew a poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard from beneath a fold of his garment, and, as he diſplayed, it, pointed with a ſtern frown to the ſpots which diſcoloured the blade; Vivaldi perceived they
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:032735_0446_0FF4981FD0ABC6C8"/>
were of blood! He turned away his eyes in horror and, when he again looked round in his dream the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure was gone.</p>
                     <p>A groan awakened him but what were his feelings, when on looking up, he perceived the ſame figure ſtanding before him! It was not, however, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately that he could convince himſelf the appearance was more than the phantom of his dream, ſtrongly impreſſed upon an alarmed fancy. The voice of the monk, for his face was as uſual concealed; recalled Vivaldi from his error; but his emotion cannot eaſily be conceived, when the ſtranger, ſlowly lifting that myſterious cowl, diſcovered to him the ſame awful countenance, which had characterized the viſion i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> his ſlumber. Unable to inquire the occaſion of this appearance, Vivaldi gazed in aſtoniſhment and terror, and did not immediately obſerve, that, inſtead of a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the monk held a lamp, which gleamed over every deep furrow of his features, yet left their ſhadow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> markings to hint the paſſions and the hiſtory of an extraordinary life.</p>
                     <p>"You are ſpared for this night," ſaid the ſtranger, "but for to-morrow"—he pauſed.</p>
                     <p>"In the name of all that is moſt ſacred," ſaid Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, endeavouring to recollect his thoughts, "who are you, what is your errand?"</p>
                     <p>"Aſk no queſtions," replied the monk, ſolemnly;—"but anſwer <hi>me.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi was ſtruck by the tone, with which he ſaid this, and dared not to urge the inquiry at the preſent moment.</p>
                     <p>"How long have you known father Schedoni?" continued the ſtranger, "Where did you firſt meet?"</p>
                     <p>"I have known him about a year, as my mother's confeſſor," replied Vivaldi "I firſt ſaw him from a corridor of the Vivaldi palace it was evening, and he was returning from the Marcheſa's cloſet."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="157" facs="unknown:032735_0447_0FF4987FAD32A208"/>
"Are you certain as to this?" ſaid the monk with peculiar emphaſis. "It is of conſequence that you ſhould be ſo."</p>
                     <p>"I am certain," repeated Vivaldi,</p>
                     <p>"It is ſtrange," obſerved the monk, after a pauſe, "that a circumſtance, which muſt have appeared tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial to you at the moment, ſhould have left ſo ſtrong a mark on your memory! In two years we have time to forget many things!" He ſighed as he ſpoke.</p>
                     <p>"I remember the circumſtance," ſaid Vivaldi, "be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was ſtruck with his appearance; the evening was far advanced—it was duſk, and he came upon me ſuddenly. His voice ſtartled me; as he paſſed he ſaid to himſelf—"It is for veſpers." At the ſame time I heard the bell of the Spirito Santo.</p>
                     <p>"Do yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I "know only what he appears to be," replied Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi.</p>
                     <p>"Did you never hear any report of his paſt life?"</p>
                     <p>"Never," anſwered Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Never any thing extraordinary concerning him?" added the monk.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi pauſed a moment; for he now recollected the obſcure and imperfect ſtory, which Paulo had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated while they were confined in the dungeon of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luzzi, reſpecting a confeſſion made in the church of the Black Penitents; but he could not preſume to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that it concerned Schedoni. He remembered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the monk's garments ſtained with blood, which he had diſcovered in the vaults of that fort. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the myſterious being, who now ſtood before him, with many other particulars of his own adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures there, paſſed like a viſion over his memory. His mind reſembled the glaſs of a magician, on which the apparitions of long buried events ariſe, and as they fleet away, point portentiouſly to ſhapes half hid in

                        </gap>uſkineſs of futurity. An unuſual dread ſeized upon him; and a ſuperſtition, ſuch as he had never before admitted in an equal degree, uſurped his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He looked up to the ſhadowy countenance of the ſtranger; and almoſt believed he beheld an inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of the world of ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>The monk ſpoke again, repeating in a ſeverer tone, "Did you never hear any thing extraordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning father Schedoni?"</p>
                     <p>"Is it reaſonable," ſaid Vivaldi, recollecting his courage, "that I ſhould anſwer the queſtions, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute queſtions of a perſon who refuſes to tell me even his name?</p>
                     <p>"My name is paſſed away—it is no more remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered," replied the ſtranger, turning from Vivaldi,—"I leave you to your fate."</p>
                     <p>"What fate?" aſked Vivaldi," and what is the purpoſe of this viſit? I conjure you in the tremendous name of the Inquiſition, to ſay!"</p>
                     <p>"Yo! will know full ſoon; have mercy on your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf!"</p>
                     <p>"What fate?" repeated Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Uurge me no further," ſaid the ſtranger; "but anſwer to what I ſhall demand. Schedoni—"</p>
                     <p>"I have told you all that I certainly know con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him," interrupted Vivaldi, the reſt is only conjecture."</p>
                     <p>"What is that conjecture? Does it relate to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion made in the church of the Black Penitents of the Santa Maria del Pianto?</p>
                     <p>"It does!" replied Vivaldi with ſurpriſe.</p>
                     <p>"What was that confeſſion?"</p>
                     <p>"I know not," anſwered Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Declare the truth," ſaid the ſtranger, ſternly.</p>
                     <p>"A confeſſion," replied Vivaldi, "is ſacred, and forever buried in the boſom of the prieſt to whom it

is made. How then, is it to be ſuppoſed that I can be acquainted with the ſubject of this?"</p>
                     <p>"Did you never hear, that father Schedoni had been guilty of ſome great crimes, which he endeavours to eraſe from his conſcience by the ſeverity of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance?</p>
                     <p>"Never! ſaid Vivaldi.</p>

                     <p>"The ſtranger pauſed, as if he wiſhed Vivaldi to fill up his meaning. Vivaldi was ſilent and aghaſt.</p>
                     <p>"You known nothing then, of Schedoni," reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the monk after a deep pauſe—"nothing of his paſt life?"</p>
                     <p>"Nothing, except what I have mentioned," replied Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Then liſten to what I ſhall unfold!" continued the monk, with ſolemnity. To morrow night you will be again carried to the place of torture; you will be taken to a chamber beyond that in which you were this night. You will there witneſs many extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things, of which you have not now any ſuſpicion. Be not diſmayed; I ſhall be there, though, perhaps, not viſible."</p>
                     <p>"Not viſible!" exclaimed Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Interrupt me not, but liſten.—When you are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of father Schdoni, ſay—that he has lived for fifteen years in the diſguiſe of a monk, a member of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans of the Sprito Santo, at Naples. When you are aſked who he is, reply—Fernando Count di Bruon. You will be aſked the motive for ſuch diſguiſe.

                     <p>"It is probable he may have forgotten ſuch confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at this diſtance of time," obſerved Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Fear not but he will remember," replied the ſtranger.</p>

I have no proof that he is the Count di Bruno, nor that he is the perpetrator of the crimes you allude to, whatever thoſe may be; and I will not be made an inſtrument to ſummon any man before a tribunal, where innocence is no protection from ignominy, and where ſuſpicion alone may inflict death."</p>
                     <p>"You doubt, then, the truth of what I aſſert?" ſaid the monk, in a haughty tone.</p>
                     <p>"Can I believe that of which I have no proof?" replied Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, there are caſes which do not admit of proof; under your peculiar circumſtances, this is one of them; you can act only upon aſſertion. I atteſt," continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the monk, raiſing his hollow voice to a tone of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſolemnity, "I atteſt the powers which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

this earth, to witneſs to the truth of what I have delivered!"</p>
                     <p>As the ſtranger uttered this adjuration, Vivaldi obſerved, with emotion, the extraordinary expreſſion, of his eyes; Vivaldi's preſence of mind, however, did not forſake him, and, in the next moment, he ſaid, "But who is he that thus atteſts? It is upon the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſtranger that I am to rely, in defect of proof! It is a ſtranger who calls upon me to bring ſolemn charges againſt a man, of whoſe guilt I know noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing!</p>
                     <p>"You are not required to bring charges; you are only to ſummon him who will."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhould ſtill aſſiſt in bringing forward accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which may be founded in error," replied Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di. "If you are convinced of their truth, why do you not ſummon Anſaldo yourſelf?"</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall do more," ſaid the monk.</p>
                     <p>"But why not ſummon alſo?" urged Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall appear," ſaid the ſtranger, with emphaſis.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, though ſomewhat awed by the manner, which accompanied theſe words, ſtill urged his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, "As a witneſs! ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>"Aye, as a dreadful witneſs!" replied the monk.</p>
                     <p>"But may not a witneſs ſummon others before the tribunal of the inquiſition?" continued Vivaldi faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teringly.</p>
                     <p>"He may," ſaid the ſtranger.</p>
                     <p>"Why when," obſerved Vivaldi," am I, a ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to you, called upon to do that which you could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form yourſelf?"</p>
                     <p>"Aſk no further," ſaid the monk, "but anſwer, whether you will deliver the ſummons?"</p>
                     <p>"The charges which muſt follow," replied Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, "appears to be of a nature too ſolemn to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy my promoting them. I reſign the taſk to you."</p>
                     <p>"When I ſummon," ſaid the ſtranger, "you ſhall obey!"</p>

Vivaldi, again awed by his, manner, again juſtified his refuſal, and concluded with repeating his ſurprize, that he ſhould be required to aſſiſt in his myſterious affair, "Since I neither know you, father," he added, "nor the Penitentiary Anſaldo, whom you bid me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh to appear."</p>
                     <p>"You ſhall know me hereafter," ſaid the ſtranger, frowningly; and he drew from beneath his garment a dagger!</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi remembered his dream.</p>
                     <p>"Mark thoſe ſpots," ſaid the Monk.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi looked, and beheld blood!</p>

                        </gap> day, the man on watch, unfaſtened the door of his cell, and brought as uſual a jug of water, and ſome bread. Vivaldi inquired the name of the ſtranger who had viſited him in the night. The centinel looked ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, and Vivaldi repeated the queſtion before he could obtain an anſwer.</p>
                     <p>"I have been on guard ſince the firſt hour,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid the man, and no perſon, in that time, has paſſed through this door!"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi regarded the centinel with attention, while he made this aſſertion, and did not receive in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner any conſciouſneſs of falſehood; yet he knew not how to believe what he had affirmed. "Did you hear no noiſe, either?" ſaid Vivaldi. "Has all been ſilent during the night?"</p>
                     <p>"I have heard only the bell of San Dominico ſtrike

                     <p>"This is incomprehenſible!" exclaimed Vivaldi, "What! no footſteps, no voice?"</p>
                     <p>The man ſmiled contemptuouſly. "None, but of the centinels," he replied.</p>
                     <p>"How can you be certain you heard only the centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, friend?" added Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"They ſpeak only to paſs the watch word, and the claſh of their arms is heard at the ſame time."</p>
                     <p>"But their footſteps!—how are they diſtinguiſhed from thoſe of other perſons?"</p>
                     <p>"By the heavineſs of their tread; our ſandals are braced with iron. But why theſe queſtions, Signor?"</p>
                     <p>"You have kept guard at the door of this cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber?" ſaid Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Signor."</p>
                     <p>"And you have not once heard, during the whole night, a voice from within it?"</p>
                     <p>"None, Signor."</p>
                     <p>"Fear nothing from diſcovery, friend; confeſs that you have ſlumbered."</p>
                     <p>"I had a comrade," replied the centinel, angrily, "has he, too, ſlumbered! and if he had, how could admittance be obtained without our keys?"</p>
                     <p>And thoſe might eaſily have been procured, friend; if you were overcome with ſleep. You may rely upon my promiſe of ſecrecy."</p>
                     <p>"What! ſaid the man, "have I kept guard for three years in the inquiſition, to be ſuſpected, by a he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic, of neglecting my duty?"</p>
                     <p>"If you were ſuſpected by an heretic" replied Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, "you ought to conſole yourſelf by recollecting that his opinions are conſidered to be erroneous.</p>

                     <p>"Signor, you ſtill dream!" replied the centinel, pauſing. "No perſon has been here."</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>"Still</hi> dream!" repeated Vivaldi, "how do you know that I have dream<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"When people ſleep, they are apt to dream," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the man, dryly. "I ſuppoſed <hi>you</hi> had ſlept, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor."</p>
                     <p>"A perſon, habited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like a monk, came to me in the night," reſumed Vivaldi, "and he deſcribed the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the ſtranger. The centinel, while he liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, became grave and thoughtful."</p>
                     <p>"Do you know any perſon reſembling the one I have mentioned?" ſaid Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"No!" replied the guard.</p>
                     <p>"Though you have not ſeen him enter my priſon," continued Vivaldi, "you may, perhaps, recollect ſuch a perſon, as an inhabitant of the Inquiſition."</p>
                     <p>"San Dominico forbid!"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, ſurpriſed at this exclamation, inquired the reaſon for it.</p>
                     <p>"I know him not," replied the centinel, changing countenance, and abruptly left the priſon. Whatever conſideration might occaſion this ſudden departure, his aſſertion that he had been for three years a guard of the inquiſition could ſcarcely be credited, ſince he had held ſo long a dialogue with the priſoner, and was, apparently, inſenſible of the danger he incurred by ſo doing.</p>

                     <p>AT about the ſame hour, as on the preceeding night, Vivaldi heard perſons approaching his priſon, and, the door unfolding, his former conductors appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They threw over him the ſame mantle as before, and in addition, a black veil, that completely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> his eyes; after which, they led him from the chamber. Vivaldi heard the door ſhut, on his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the centinels followed his ſteps, as if their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was finiſhed, and he was to return thither no more. At this moment, he remembered the words of the ſtranger, when he had diſplayed the poignard, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi apprehended the worſt, from having thwarted the deſigns of a perſon apparently ſo malignant; but he exulted in the rectitude, which had preſerved him from debaſement; and, with the magnanimous enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm of virtue, he almoſt welcomed ſufferings, which would prove the firmneſs of his juſtice towards an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; for he determined to brave every thing, rather than impute to Schedoni circumſtances, the truth of which he poſſeſſed no means of aſcertaining.</p>
                     <p>While Vivaldi was conducted, as on the preceeding night, through many paſſages, he endeavoured to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, by their length, and the abruptneſs of their tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, whether they where the ſame he had traverſed before. Suddenly, one of his conductors cried 'Steps!' It was the firſt word Vivaldi had ever heard him utter immediately perceived that the ground ſunk, and, he began to deſcend; as he did whch, he tried to count,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:032735_0456_0FF498374161FD18"/>
the number of ſteps, that he might form ſome judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whether this was the flight he had paſſed before. When he had reached the bottom, he inclined to believe it was not ſo; and the care which had been obſerved i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> blinding him, ſeemed to indicate that he was going <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſome new place.</p>
                     <p>He paſſed through ſeveral avenues, and then aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; ſoon after which, he again deſcended a very long ſtair-caſe, ſuch as he had not a remembrance of, and they paſſed over a conſiderable extent of level ground. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the hollow ſounds which his ſteps returned, he judged that he was walking over vaults. The footſteps of the centinels who had followed from the cell were no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger heard, and he ſeemed to be left with his conductor only. A ſecond flight appeared to lead him into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous vaults, for he perceived the air change, and felt a damp vapour wrapt round him. The menace of the monk, that he ſhould meet him in the chambers of death, frequently occurred to Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>His conductors ſtopped in this vault, and ſeemed to hold a conſultation, but they ſpoke in ſuch low accents, that their words were not diſtinguiſhable, except a few unconnected ones, that hinted of more than Vivaldi could comprehended. He was, at length, again led for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and ſoon after, he heard the heavy grating of hinges, and perceived that he was paſſing through ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral doors, by the ſituation of which Vivaldi judge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> they were the ſame he had entered the night before, and concluded, that he was going to the hall of the tribunal.</p>
                     <p>His conductors ſtopped again, and Vivaldi heard the iron <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>od ſtrike three times upon a door; immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately a ſtrange voice ſpoke from within, and the door uncloſed. Vivaldi paſſed on, and imagined that he was admitted into a ſpacious vault; for the air was free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and his ſteps ſounded to a diſtance.</p>
                     <p>Preſently a voice, as on the preceeding night, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned

him to come forward, and Vivaldi underſtood that he was again before the tribunal. It was the voice of the inquiſitor who had been his chief examiner.</p>
                     <p>"You, Vincentio di Vivaldi," it ſaid, "anſwer to your name, and to the queſtions which ſhall be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>As the monk had predicted, Vivaldi was aſked what he knew of father Schedoni, and, when he replied, as he had formerly done to his myſterious viſitor, he was told that he knew more than he acknowledged.</p>
                     <p>"I <hi>know</hi> no more," replied Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"You equivocate," ſaid the inquiſitor. "Declare what you have heard, and remember that you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly took an oath to that purpoſe."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi was ſilent, till a tremendous voice from the tribunal commanded him to reſpect his oath.</p>
                     <p>"I do reſpect it," ſaid Vivaldi; and I conjure to believe that I alſo reſpect truth, when I declare, that what I am going to relate, is a report to which I give no confidence, and concerning even the probability of which I cannot produce the ſmalleſt proof."</p>
                     <p>"Reſpect truth!" ſaid another voice from the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, and Vivaldi fancied he diſtinguiſhed the tones of the monk. He pauſed a moment, and the exorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was repeated. Vivaldi then related what the ſtranger had ſaid concerning the family of Schedoni, and the diſguiſe which the father had aſſumed in the convent of the Spirito Santo; but forbore even to name the penitentiary Anſaldo, and any circumſtance connected with the extraordinary confeſſion. Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di concluded, with again declaring, that he had not ſufficient authority to juſtify a belief in thoſe reports.</p>
                     <p>"On what authority do you repeat them?" ſaid the vicar-generally.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi was ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"On what authority?" inquired the inquiſitor. ſternly.</p>
                     <p>

Vivaldi, after a momentary heſitation, ſaid, "what I am about to declare, holy fathers, is ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary—"</p>
                     <p>"Tremble!" ſaid a voice cloſe to his ear, which he inſtantly knew to be the monk's, and the ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of which electrified him. He was unable to conclude the ſentence.</p>
                     <p>"What is your authority for the reports?" demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the inquiſitor.</p>
                     <p>"It is unknown, even to myſelf!" anſwered Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi.</p>
                     <p>"Do not equivocate!" ſaid the vicar-general.</p>
                     <p>"I ſolemnly proteſt," rejoined Vivaldi, "that I know not either the name or the condition of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, and that I never even beheld his face, till the period when he ſpoke of father Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>"Tremble!' repeated the ſame low, but emphatic voice in his ear. Vivaldi ſtarted, and turning involuntary towards the ſound, though his eyes could not aſſiſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"You did well to ſay, that you had ſomething ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary to add," obſerved the inquiſitor. "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Vivaldi was too proud to attempt the juſtifying himſelf againſt ſo groſs an accuſation, or to make any reply.</p>
                     <p>"Why do you not ſummon father Anſaldo?" ſaid the voice. "Remember my words!"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, again awed by the voice, heſitated, for an inſtant, how to act, and in that inſtant his courage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>
                     <p>"My infomer ſtands beſide me!" ſaid Vivaldi boldly; "I know his voice! Detain him; it is of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence"</p>
                     <p>"Whoſe voice?" demanded the inquiſitor. No perſon ſpoke but myſelf!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="169" facs="unknown:032735_0459_0FF49892530F0358"/>
"Whoſe voice?" ſaid the vicar-general.</p>
                     <p>"The voice was cloſe beſide me," replied Vivaldi. "It ſpoke low but I knew it well."</p>
                     <p>"This is either the cunning, or the frenzy of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair!" obſerved the vicar-general.</p>
                     <p>"Not any perſon is now beſide you, except the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars," ſaid the inquiſitor, "and they wait to do their office, if you ſhall refuſe to anſwer the queſtions put to you."</p>
                     <p>"I perſiſt in my aſſertion," replied Vivaldi; "and I ſupplicate that my eyes may be unbound, that I may know my enemy."</p>
                     <p>The tribunal after a long private conſultation, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the requeſt; the veil was withdrawn, and Vivaldi perceived beſide him only the familiars! Their faces, as is uſual, were concealed. It appeared that one of theſe torturers muſt be the myſterious enemy, who purſued him, if, indeed, that enemy was an inhabitant of the earth! and Vivaldi requeſted that they might be ordered to uncover their features. He was ſternly rebuked for ſo preſumptuous a requiſition, and remind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the inviolable law and faith, which the tribunal had pledged, that perſons appointed to their awful office ſhould never be expoſed to the revenge of the crimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, whom it might be their duty to puniſh.</p>
                     <p>"Their duty!" exclaimed Vivaldi, thrown from his guard by ſtrong indignation. "And is faith held ſacred with demons!"</p>
                     <p>Without awaiting the order of the tribunal, the familiars immediately covered Vivaldi's face with the veil, and he felt himſelf in their graſp. He endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, however, to diſentangle his hands, and, at length, ſhook theſe men from their hold, and again unveiled his eyes; but the familiars were inſtantly ordered to replace the veil.</p>
                     <p>The inquiſitor bade Vivaldi to recollect in whoſe preſence he then was, and to dread the puniſhment
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:032735_0460_0FF4983A4E877798"/>
which his reſiſtance had incurred, and which would be inflicted without delay, unleſs he could give ſome inſtance, that might tend to prove the truth of his late aſſertions.</p>
                     <p>"If you expect that I ſhould ſay more," replied Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, "I claim, at leaſt, protection from the unbidden violence of the men who guard me. If they are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, at their pleaſure, to ſport with the miſery of their priſoner, I will be inflexibly ſilent; and, ſince I muſt ſuffer, it ſhall be according to the laws of the tribunal."</p>
                     <p>The vicar-general, or, as he is called, the grand inquiſitor, promiſed Vivaldi the degree of protection he claimed, and demanded, at the ſame time, what were the words he had juſt heard.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi conſidered, that though juſtice bade him avoid accuſing an enemy of ſuſpicious circumſtances, concerning which he had no proof, yet, that neither juſtice nor common ſenſe required he ſhould make a ſacrafice of himſelf to the dilemma in which he was placed: he, therefore, without further ſcruple, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that the voice had bidden him require of the tribunal to ſummon one father Anſaldo, the grand penitentiary of the Santa del Pianto, near Naples, and alſo father Schedoni, who was to anſwer to extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary charges, which would be brought againſt him by Anſaldo. Vivaldi anxiouſly and repeatedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he knew not the nature of the charges, nor that any juſt grounds for them exiſted.</p>
                     <p>Theſe aſſertions ſeemed to throw the tribunal into new perplexity. Vivaldi heard their buſy voices in low debate, which continued for a conſiderable time. In this interval he had leiſure to perceive the many improbabilities that either of the familiars ſhould be the ſtranger who ſo myſteriouſly haunted him; and among theſe was the circumſtance of his having reſided ſo long at Naples</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="171" facs="unknown:032735_0461_0FF4989E7913F428"/>
The tribunal, after ſome had time elapſed in conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, proceeded on the examination, &amp; Vivaldi was aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what he knew of father Anſaldo. He immediately replied, that Anſaldo was an utter ſtranger to him, and that he was not even acquainted with a ſingle perſon reſiding in the Santa del Pianto who had any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the penitentiary.</p>
                     <p>"How!" ſaid the grand inquiſitor, "You forget that the perſon, who bade you require of this tribunal to ſummon Anſaldo, has knowledge of him."</p>
                     <p>"Pardon me, I do not forget," replied Vivaldi; "and I requeſt it may be remembered that I am not acquainted with that perſon. If, therefore, he had given me any account of Anſaldo, I could not have relied upon its authenticity." Vivaldi again required of the tribunal to underſtand that he did not ſummon Anſaldo, or any other perſon, before them, but had merely obeyed their command to repeat what the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger had ſaid.</p>
                     <p>The tribunal acknowledged the juſtneſs of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and exculpated him from any harm that ſhould be the conſequence of the ſummons. But this aſſurance of ſafety for himſelf was not ſufficient to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe Vivaldi, who was alarmed leſt he ſhould be the means of bringing an innocent perſon under ſuſpicion. The grand inquiſitor again addreſſed him, after a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ſilence had been commanded in the court.</p>
                     <p>"The account you have given of your informer," ſaid he, "is ſo extraordinary, that it would not deſerve credit, but that you have diſcovered the utmoſt reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to reveal the charges he gave you, from which it appears, that, on your part, at leaſt, the ſummons is not malicious. But are you certain that you have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded yourſelf, and that the voice beſide you was not an imaginary one, conjured up by your agitated ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits?"</p>
                     <p>"I am certain," replied Vivaldi, with firmneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="172" facs="unknown:032735_0462_0FF4983BD52329D0"/>
"It is true," reſumed the grand inquiſitor, "that ſeveral perſons were near you, when you exclaimed, that you heard the voice of your informer; yet no perſon heard it beſides yourſelf!"</p>
                     <p>"Where are thoſe perſons now?" demanded Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi.</p>
                     <p>"They are diſperſed; alarmed at your accuſation."</p>
                     <p>"If you will ſummon them," ſaid Vivaldi, "and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that my eyes may be uncovered, I will point out to you, without heſitation, the perſon of my informer, ſhould he remain among them."</p>
                     <p>The tribunal commanded that they ſhould appear, but new difficulties aroſe. It was not remembered of whom the crowd conſiſted, a few individuals only were recollected, and theſe were ſummoned.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, in ſolemn expectation, heard ſteps and the hum of voices gathering round him, and impatiently awaited for the words that would reſtore him to ſight, and, perhaps releaſe him from uncertainty. In a few moments he heard the command given: the veil was once more removed from his eyes, and he was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to point out the accuſer. Vivaldi threw an haſty glance upon the ſurrounding ſtrangers.</p>
                     <p>"The lights burn dimly," ſaid he, "I cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh theſe faces."</p>
                     <p>It was ordered that a lamp ſhould be lowered from the roof, and that the ſtrangers ſhould arrange them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on either ſide of Vivaldi. When this was done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he glanced his eyes again upon the crowd, "He is not here!" ſaid Vivaldi; not one of theſe counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances reſembles the monk of Paluzzi. Yet, ſtay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who is he that ſtands in the ſhade behind thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons on the left? Bid him lift his cowl!"</p>
                     <p>The crowd fell back, and the perſon, to whom Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi had pointed, was left alone within the circle.</p>
                     <p>"He is an officer of the Inquiſition, "ſaid a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

his face, unleſs by an expreſs command from the tribunal."</p>
                     <p>"I call upon the tribunal to command it!" ſaid Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Who calls!" exclaimed a voice, and Vivaldi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized the tones of the monk, but he knew not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly whence they came.</p>
                     <p>"I Vincentio di Vivaldi," replied the priſoner, "I claim the privilege that has been awarded me, and bid you unveil your countenance."</p>
                     <p>There was a pauſe of ſilence in the court, except that a dull murmur ran through the tribunal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Meanwhile, the figure within the circle ſtood motionleſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained veiled.</p>
                     <p>"Spare him," ſaid the man, who had before addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Vivaldi; "he has reaſons for wiſhing to remain unknown, which you cannot conjecture. He is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of the Inquiſition, and not the perſon you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps I <hi>can</hi> conjecture his reaſons," replied Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, who, raiſing his voice, added, "I appeal to this tribunal, and command you, who ſtand alone within the circle, you in black garments, to unveil your fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures!"</p>
                     <p>Immediately a loud voice iſſued from the tribunal, and ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"We command you, in the name of the moſt holy Inquiſition, to reveal yourſelf!"</p>
                     <p>The ſtranger trembled, but, without preſuming to heſitate, uplifted his cowl. Vivaldi's eyes were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly fixed upon him; but the action diſcloſed, not the countenance of the monk? but an official whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

At the aſſertion of Vivaldi, the members of the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal looked upon each other doubtingly, and were ſilent, till the grand inquiſitor waving his hand, as if to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand attention, addreſſed Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"It appears, then, that you <hi>have</hi> formerly ſeen the face of your informer!"</p>
                     <p>"I have already declared ſo," replied Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>The grand inquiſitor demanded when, and where, he had ſeen it.</p>
                     <p>"Laſt night, and in my priſon," anſwered Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi.</p>
                     <p>"In your priſon!" ſaid the ordinary inquiſitor, contemptuouſly, who had before examined him, "and in your dreams, too, no doubt!"</p>
                     <p>"In your priſon!" exclaimed ſeveral members of the lower tribunal.</p>
                     <p>"He dreams ſtill!" obſerved an inquiſitor. "Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fathers! he abuſes your patience, and the frenzy of terror has deluded his credulity. We neglect the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments."</p>
                     <p>"We muſt inquire farther into this," ſaid another inquiſitor. "Here is ſome deception. If you, Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centio di Vivaldi, have aſſerted a falſhood—tremble!"</p>
                     <p>Whether Vivaldi's memory ſtill vibrated with the voice of the monk, or that the tone in which this ſame word was now pronounced, did reſemble it, he almoſt ſtarted, when the inquiſitor had ſaid <hi>tremble!</hi> and he demanded who ſpoke then.</p>
                     <p>"It is ourſelf," anſwered the inquiſitor.</p>
                     <p>After a ſhort converſation among the members of the tribunal, the grand inquiſitor gave orders that the centinels, who had watched on the preceding night at the priſon door of Vivaldi, ſhould be brought into the hall of juſtice. The perſons, who had been lately ſummoned into the chamber, were now bidden to withdraw, and all further examination was ſuſpended till the arrival of the centinels: Vivaldi heard only
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:032735_0465_0FF498A0039B1880"/>
the low voices of the inquiſitors, as they converſed privately together, and he remained ſilent, thoughtful, and amazed.</p>
                     <p>When the centinels appeared, and were aſked who had entered the priſon of Vivaldi during the laſt night, they declared, without heſitation, or confuſion; that not any perſon had paſſed through the door after the hour when the priſoner had returned from examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till the following morning, when the guard had carried in the uſual allowance of bread and water. In this aſſertion, they perſiſted, without the leaſt equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, notwithſtanding which they were ordered into confinement, till the affair ſhould be cleared up.</p>
                     <p>The doubts, however, which were admitted, as to the integrity of theſe men, did not contribute to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate thoſe, which had prevailed over the oppoſite ſide of the queſtion. On the contrary, the ſuſpicions of the tribunal, augmenting with their perplexity, ſeemed to fluctuate equally over every point of the ſubject before them, till, inſtead of throwing any light upon the truth, they only ſerved to involve the whole in deeper obſcurity. More doubtful than before of the honeſty of Vivaldi's extraordinary aſſertions, the inquiſitor informed him, that if, after further inquiry into this affair, it ſhould appear he had been trifling with the credulity of his judges, he would be ſeverely puniſhed for his audacity; but that on the other hand, ſhould there be reaſon to believe that the centinels had failed in their duty, and that ſome perſon had entered his priſon during the night, the tribunal would proceed in a different manner.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, perceiving that, to be believed, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary he ſhould be more circumſtantial, deſcribed, with exactneſs, the perſon and appearance of the monk, without, however, mentioning the poignard which had been exhibited. A profound ſilence reigned in the chamber while he ſpoke; it ſeemed a ſilence not
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:032735_0466_0FF498465C466740"/>
merely of attention, but of aſtoniſhment. Vivaldi himſelf was awed, and, when he had concluded, almoſt expected to hear the voice of the monk uttering defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or threatning vengeance; but all remained huſhed, till the inquiſitor, who had firſt examined him, ſaid in a ſolemn tone.</p>
                     <p>"We have liſtened with attention to what you have delivered, and will give the caſe a full inquiry. Some points, on which you have touched, excite our amazement, and call for particular regard. Retire whence you came—and ſleep this night without fear; <hi>you will ſoon know more.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi was immediately led from the chamber, and ſtill blindfolded, re-conducted to the priſon to which he had ſuppoſed it was deſigned he ſhould return no more. When the veil was withdrawn, he perceived that his guard was changed.</p>
                     <p>Again left to the ſilence of his cell, he reviewed all that had paſſed in the chamber of juſtice; the queſtions which had been put to him; the different manners of the inquiſitors; the occurrence of the monk's voice; and the ſimilarity, which he had fancied he perceived between it and that of an inquiſitor, when the latter pronounced the word <hi>tremble;</hi> but the conſideration of all theſe circumſtances did not in any degree relieve him from his perplexity. Sometimes he was inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think that the monk was an inquiſitor, and the voice had more than once appeared to proceed from the tribunal; but he remembered, alſo, that, more than once, it had ſpoken cloſe to his ear, and he knew that a member of this tribu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>al might not leave his ſtation during the examination of a priſoner, and that, even if he had dared to do ſo, his ſingular dreſs would have pointed him out to notice, and conſequently to ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, at the moment when Vivaldi had exclaimed, that he heard the voice of his informer.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, however, could not avoid meditating, with
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:032735_0467_0FF498A188AD9E60"/>
ſurprize, on the laſt words which the inquiſitor, who had been his chief examiner, had addreſſed to him, when he was diſmiſſed from before the tribunal. Theſe were the more ſurprizing, becauſe they were the firſt from him that had in any degree indicated a wiſh to conſole or quiet the alarm of the priſoner; and Vivaldi even fancied that they betrayed ſome fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that he would not be diſturbed this night by the preſence of his awful viſitor. He would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely have ceaſed to apprehend, though not to expect, had he been allowed a light, and any weapon of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, if, in truth, the ſtranger was of a nature to fear a weapon; but, to be thus expoſed to the deſigns of a myſterious and powerful being, whom he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of having offended, to ſuſtain ſuch a ſituation, without fuffering anxiety, required ſomewhat more than courage, or leſs than reaſon.</p>

                     <p>IN conſequence of what had tranſpired at the laſt examination of Vivaldi, the grand penitentiary Anſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, together with the father Schedoni, were cited to appear before the table of the holy office.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni was arreſted on his way to Rome, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was going privately to make further efforts for the liberation of Vivaldi, whoſe releaſe he had found it more difficult to effect, than his impriſonment; the perſon upon whoſe aſſiſtance the Confeſſor relied in the firſt inſtance, having boaſted of more influence than he poſſeſſed, or perhaps thought it prudent to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert. Schedoni had been the more anxious to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure an immediate releaſe for Vivaldi, leſt a report of his ſituation ſhould reach his family, notwithſtanding the precautions, which are uſually employed to throw an impenetrable ſhrowd over the priſoners of this dreadful tribunal, and bury them for ever from the knowledge of their friends. Such premature diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Vivaldi's circumſtances, Schedoni apprehended might include alſo a diſcovery of the perſecutor, and draw down upon himſelf the abhorrence and the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of a family, whom it was now, more than ever, his wiſh and his intereſt to conciliate. It was ſtill his intention, that the nuptials of Vivaldi and Ellena ſhould be privately ſolemnized immediately on the releaſe of the priſoner, who, even if he had reaſon to ſuſpect Schedoni for his late perſecutor, would then be

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lſo, did he apprehend what would be the further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of a diſcloſure, which the peculiar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his ſituation had hardly permitted him to withhold, though, could he have underſtood the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble event of it, he would have braved all the terrors of the tribunal, and death itſelf, rather than incur the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of having promoted it.</p>
                     <p>The motive for his arreſtation was concealed from Schedoni, who had not the remoteſt ſuſpicion of its nature, but attributed the arreſt, to a diſcovery, which the tribunal had made of his being the accuſer of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi. This diſcloſure he attributed to his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, in having ſtated as an inſtance of Vivaldi's contempt for the Catholic faith, that he had inſulted a prieſt while doing penance in the church of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rito Santo. But by what art the tribunal had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that he was the prieſt alluded to, and the author of the accuſation, Schedoni could by no mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture. He was willing to believe that this arreſt was only for the purpoſe of obtaining proof of Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di's guilt; and the Confeſſor knew that he could ſo conduct himſelf in evidence, as in all probability to exculpate the priſoner, from whom, when he ſhould explain himſelf, no reſentment on account of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer conduct was to be apprehended. Yet Schedoni was not perfectly at eaſe; for it was poſſible that a knowledge of Vivaldi's ſituation, and of the author of it, had reached his family, and had produced his own arreſt. On this head, however, his fears were not powerful; ſince, the longer he dwelt upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the more improbable it appeared that ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:032735_0470_0FF4984969D13340"/>
at leaſt ſo far as it related to himſelf, could have been affected.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, from the night of his late examination, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of the tribunal. The two latter had already been ſeparately examined, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaldo had privately ſtated the particulars of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> he had received on the vigil of the Santo Marco in the year 1752, for which diſcloſure he had received formal abſolution. What had paſſed at that examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does not appear, but on this his ſecond interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was required to repeat the ſubject and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the confeſſion. This was probably with a veiw of obſerving its effect upon Schedoni and on Vivaldi, which would direct the opinion of the tribunal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s to the guilt of the confeſſor, and the veracity of the young priſoner.</p>
                     <p>On this night a very exact inquiry was made, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning every perſon, who had obtained admiſſion into the hall of juſtice; ſuch officials as were not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately neceſſary to aſſiſt in the ceremonies of the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal were excluded, together with every other perſon belonging to the Inquiſition not material to the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or to the judges. When this ſcrutiny was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the priſoners were brought in, and their conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ordered to withdraw. A ſilence of ſome moments prevailed in the hall; and, however different might be the reflections of the ſeveral priſoners, the degree of anxious expectation was in each, probably, nearly the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The grand-vicar having ſpoken a few words in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate to a perſon on his left hand, an inquiſitor roſe.</p>
                     <p>"If any perſon in this court," ſaid he, "is known by the name of father Schedoni, belonging to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minican ſociety of the Spirito Santo at Naples, let him appear!"</p>
                     <p>Schedoni anſwered the ſummons. He came for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:032735_0471_0FF498AD99793998"/>
with a firm ſtep, and having croſſed himſelf, and bowed to the tribunal, awaited in ſilence its commands.</p>
                     <p>The penitentiary Anſaldo was next called upon. Vivaldi obſerved that he faultered as he advanced: and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>is obeiſance to the tribunal was more profound than Schedoni's had been. Vivaldi himſelf was then ſummoned; his air was calm and dignified, and his countenance expreſſed the ſolemn energy of his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but nothing of dejection.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni and Anſaldo were now, for the firſt time, confronted. Whatever might be the feelings of Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni on beholding the penitentiary of the <hi>Santa del Pianto,</hi> he effectually concealed them.</p>
                     <p>The grand-vicar himſelf opened the examination. "you father Schedoni, of the Spirito Santo," he ſaid, "anſwer and ſay whether the perſon who ſtands before you, bearing the title of grand penitentiary of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Black Penitents,</hi> and preſiding over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of the <hi>Santa Maria del Pianto</hi> at Naples, is known to you."</p>
                     <p>To this requiſition, Schedoni replied with firmneſs in the negative.</p>
                     <p>"You have never, to your knowledge, ſeen him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this hour?"</p>
                     <p>"Never!" ſaid Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>"Let the oath be adminiſtered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" added the grand-vicar. Schedoni having accepted it; the ſame queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were put to Anſaldo concerning the Confeſſor, when to the aſtoniſhment of Vivaldi and of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the court, the penitentiary denied all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Schedoni. His negative was given, however, in a leſs deciſive manner than that of the Confeſſor, and when the uſual oath was offered, Anſaldo declined to accept it.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi was next called upon to identify Schedoni: he declared, that the perſon who was then pointed out to him, he had never known by any other denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:032735_0472_0FF49853D7E83D40"/>
than that of father Schedoni; and that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways underſtood him to be a monk of the Spirito San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; but Vivaldi was at the ſame time careful to repeat, that he knew nothing further relative to his life.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni was ſomewhat ſurprized at this apparent candor of Vivaldi towards himſelf, but accuſtomed to impute an evil motive to all conduct, which he could not clearly comprehend, he did not ſcruple to believe, that ſome latent miſchief was directed againſt him in this ſeemingly honeſt declaration.</p>
                     <p>After <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ome further preliminary forms had paſſed, Anſaldo was ordered to relate the particulars of the confeſſion, which had been made to him on the eve of the Santo Marco. It muſt be remembered, that this was ſtill what is called in the Inquiſition, a <hi>private</hi> examination.</p>
                     <p>After he had taken the cuſtomary oaths to relate neither more nor leſs than the truth of what had paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before him, Anſaldo's depoſitions were written down nearly in the following words; to which Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di liſtened with almoſt trembling attention, for beſides the curioſity which ſome previous circumſtances had excited reſpecting them, he believed that his own fate in a great meaſure depended upon a diſcovery of the fact to which they led. What, if he had ſurmiſed how much! and that the perſon, whom he had been in ſome degree inſtrumental in citing before this tremendous tribunal was the father of his Ellena di Roſalba!</p>
                     <p>Anſaldo having again anſwered to his name and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, gave his depoſition as follows:</p>
                     <p>"It was on the eve of the twenty-fifth of April, and in the year 1752, that as I ſat, according to my cuſtom, in the confeſſional of San Marco, I was alar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by deep groans, which came from the box on my left hand."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi obſerved, that the date now mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with that recorded by the ſtranger, and he was
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:032735_0473_0FF498AF2092A750"/>
thus prepared to believe what might follow, and to give his confidence to this extraordinary and unſeen perſonage.</p>
                     <p>Anſaldo continued, "I was more alarmed by theſe ſounds, becauſe I had not been prepared for them; I knew not that any perſon was in the confeſſional nor had obſerved any one paſs along the aiſle—but the duſkineſs of the hour may account for my having failed to do ſo; it was after ſun-ſet, and the tapers at the ſhrine of San Antonio as yet burned feebly in the twilight."</p>
                     <p>"Be brief, holy father," ſaid the inquiſitor, who had formerly been moſt active in examining Vivaldi; ſpeak cloſely to the point."</p>
                     <p>"The groans would ſometimes ceaſe," reſumed Anſaldo, "and long pauſes of ſilence follow; they were thoſe of a ſoul in agony, ſtruggling with the conſciouſneſs of guilt, yet wanting reſolution to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it. I tried to encourage the penitent, and held forth every hope of mercy and forgiveneſs which my duty would allow, but for a conſiderable time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect;—the enormity of the ſin ſeemed too big for utterance, yet the penitent appeared equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to endure the concealment of it. His heart was burſting with the ſecret, and required the comfort of abſolution, even at the price of the ſevereſt penance."</p>
                     <p>"Facts!" ſaid the inquiſitor; "theſe are only ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes."</p>
                     <p>"Facts will come too ſoon?" replied Anſaldo, and bowed his head: "the mention of them will petrify you, holy fathers! as they did me, though not for the ſame reaſons. While I endeavoured to encourage the penitent, and aſſured him, that abſolution ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the acknowledgement of his crimes, however heinous thoſe crimes might be if accompanied by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere repentance, he more than once began his confe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and abruptly dropt it. Once, indeed, he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:032735_0474_0FF498555E30D9F0"/>
the confeſſional; his agitated ſpirit required liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and it was then, as he walked with perturbed ſteps along the aiſle, that I firſt obſerved his figure. He was in the habit of a white friar, and as nearly as I can recollect, was about the ſtature of him, the father, Schedoni, who now ſtands before me."</p>
                     <p>As Anſaldo delivered theſe words, the attention of the whole trib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nal was turned upon Schedoni, who ſtood unmoved, and with his eyes bent towards the ground.</p>
                     <p>"His face." continued the penitentiary, "I did not ſee; he was, with good reaſon, careful to conceal it; other reſemblance, therefore, than the ſtature, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> cannot point out between them. The voice, indeed, the voice of the penitent, I think I ſhall never forget; I ſhould know it again at any diſtance of time."</p>
                     <p>"Has it not ſtruck your ear, ſince you came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe walls!" ſaid a member of the tribunal.</p>
                     <p>"Of that hereafter," obſerved, the inquiſitor, "you wander from the point father."</p>
                     <p>The vicar-general remarked, that the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces juſt related were important, and ought not to be paſſed over as irrevalent. The inquiſitor ſubmitted to this opinion, but objected that they were not perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the moment; and Anſaldo was again bidden to repeat what he had heard at confeſſion.</p>
                     <p>"When the ſtranger returned to the ſteps of the confeſſional, he had acquired ſufficient reſolution to go through with the taſk he had impoſed upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and a thrilling voice ſpoke through the grate the facts I am about to relate."</p>
                     <p>father Anſaldo pauſed, and was ſomewhat agitated; he ſeemed endeavouring to recollect courage to go through with what he had begun During this pauſe, the ſilence of expectation rapt the court, and the eyes of the tribunal were directed alternately to Anſaldo and Schedoni, who certainly required ſomething more
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:032735_0475_0FF498B0A4B00F30"/>
than human firmneſs to ſupport unmoved the ſevere ſcrutiny, and the yet ſeverer ſuſpicions, to which he ſtood expoſed. Whether, however, it was the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of conſcious innocence, or the hardihood of atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious vice, that protected the Confeſſor, he certainly did not betray any emotion. Vivaldi, who had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſingly obſerved him from the commencement of the depoſitions, felt inclined to believe that he was not the penitent deſcribed. Anſaldo, having, at length, recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected himſelf, proceeded as follows:</p>
                     <p>"I have been through life," ſaid the penitent, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lave of my paſſions, and they have led me into horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceſſes. I had once a brother!"—He ſtopped, and deep groans again told the agony of his ſoul; at length, he added,—"that brother had a wife."—Now liſten, father, and ſay, whether guilt like mine may hope for abſolution? She was beautiful—I loved her: ſhe was virtuous, and I deſpaired. You, father,' he continued in a frightful tone, 'never knew the fury of deſpair! It overcame or communicated its own force to every other paſſion of my ſoul, and I ſought to releaſe myſelf from its tortures by any means." My brother died!'—The penitent pauſed again,' con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Anſaldo, 'I trembled while I liſtened; my lips were ſealed. At length, I bade him proceed, and he ſpoke as follows.—'My brother died a diſtance from home.'—Again the penitent pauſed, and the ſilence continued ſo long, that I thought it proper to enquire of what diſorder the brother had expired, 'Father, I was his murderer?' ſaid the penitent, in a voice which I never can forget; it ſunk into my heart."</p>
                     <p>Anſaldo appeared affected by the remembrance, and was for a moment ſilent. At the laſt words Vivaldi had particularly noticed Schedoni, that he might judge by their effect upon him whether he was guilty; but he remained in his former attitude, and his eyes were ſtill fixed upon the ground.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="186" facs="unknown:032735_0476_0FF49856E3E53968"/>
"Proceed, father!" ſaid the inquiſitor, "what was your reply to this confeſſion?"</p>
                     <p>"I was ſilent," ſaid Anſaldo; "but at length I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the penitent go on. 'I contrived, ſaid he, that my brother ſhould die at a diſtance from home, and I ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the affair that his widow never ſuſpected the cauſe of his death. It was not till long, after the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al time of mourning had expired, that I ventured to ſolicit her hand: but ſhe had not yet forgotten my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſhe rejected me. My paſſion would no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be trifled with. I cauſed her to be carried from her houſe, and ſhe was afterwards willing to retrieve her honour by the marriage vow. I had ſacrified my conſcience, without having found happineſs;—ſhe did not even condeſcend to conceal her diſdain. Mortified, exaſperated by her conduct, I began to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that ſome other emotion than reſentment occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this diſdain; and laſt of all, jealouſy—jealouſy came to crown my miſery—to light up all my paſſions into madneſs!"</p>
                     <p>"The penitent," added Anſaldo, "appeared, by the manner in which he uttered this, to be nearly frantic at th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Among the few perſons who viſited us in the retirement of our country reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, was a gentleman, who, I fancied, loved my wife I fancied too, that whenever he appeared, an air of particular ſatisfaction was viſible on her countenance.' She ſeemed to have pleaſure in converſing with, and ſhewing him diſtinction. I even ſometimes thought, ſhe had pride in diſplaying to me the preference ſhe entertained for him, and that an air of triumph, and even of ſcorn, was addreſſed to me, whenever ſhe mentioned his name. Perhaps I miſtook reſentment for love, and ſhe only wiſhed to puniſh me, by exciting my jealouſy. Fatal error! ſhe puniſhed herſelf alſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="187" facs="unknown:032735_0477_0FF498B22A278100"/>
"Be leſs circumſtantial, father," ſaid the inquiſitor.</p>
                     <p>Anſaldo bowed his head, and continued, "One e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening" continued the penitent, "that I returned home unexpectedly, I was told that a viſitor was with my wife! As I approached the apartment where they ſat, I heard the voice of Sacchi; it ſeemed mournful and ſupplicating. I ſtopped to liſten, and diſtinguiſhed though to fire me with vengeance. I reſtrained my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, however, ſo far as to ſtep ſoftly to a lattice that opened from the paſſage, and overlooked the apartment. The traitor was on his knee before her. Whether ſhe had heard my ſtep, or obſerved my face, through the high lattice, or that ſhe reſented his conduct, I know not, but ſhe roſe immediately from her chair. I did not pauſe to queſtion her motive; but, ſeizing my ſtiletto, I ruſhed into the room, with intent to ſtrike it to the villain's heart. The ſuppoſed aſſaſſin of my honor eſcaped into the garden, and was heard of no more"—But your wife? ſaid I. "Her boſom receives the poignard!" replied the penitent."</p>
                     <p>Anſaldo's voice faultered, as he repeated this part of the confeſſion, and he was utterly unable to proceed. The tribunal, obſerving his condition, allowed him a chair, and, after a ſtruggle of ſome moments, he added, "Think, holy father, O think! what muſt have been my feelings at that inſtant! I was myſelf the lover of the woman, whom he confeſſed himſelf to have mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered."</p>
                     <p>"Was ſhe innocent?" ſaid a voice; and Vivaldi, whoſe attention had latterly been fixed upon Anſaldo, now, on looking at Schedoni, perceived that it was he who had ſpoken. At the ſound of his voice, the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary turned inſtantly towards him. There was a pauſe of a general ſilence, during which Anſaldo's eyes were earneſtly fixed upon the accuſed. At length, he ſpoke, "She was innocent!" He replied, with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn emphaſis, "She was moſt virtuous!"</p>

Schedoni had ſhrunk back within himſelf; he aſked no further. A murmur ran through the tribunal, which roſe by degrees, till it broke forth into audible converſation; at length, the ſecretary was directed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"Was that the voice of the penitent, which you have juſt heard?" demanded the inquiſitor of Anſaldo. "Remember, you have ſaid that you ſhould know it again!"</p>
                     <p>"I think it was," replied Anſaldo; "but I cannot ſwear to that."</p>
                     <p>"What infirmity of judgment is this!" ſaid the ſame inquiſitor, who himſelf was ſeldom troubled with the modeſty of doubt, upon any ſubject. Anſaldo was bidden to reſume the narrative.</p>
                     <p>"On this diſcovery of the murderer," ſaid the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itentiary, "I quitted the confeſſional, and my ſenſes forſook me before I could deliver orders for the detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the aſſaſſin. When I recovered it was too late; he had eſcaped! From that hour to the preſent, I have never ſeen him, nor dare I affirm that the perſon now before me is he."</p>
                     <p>The inquiſitor was about to ſpeak, but the grand-vicar waved his hand, as a ſignal for attention, and addreſſing Anſaldo, ſaid, "Although you may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with Schedoni, the monk of the Spirito Santo reverend father, can you not recollect the perſon of the Count di Bruno, your former friend?"</p>
                     <p>Anſaldo again looked at Schedoni, with a ſcrutini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing eye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he fixed it long; but the countenance of Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni ſuffered no change.</p>
                     <p>"No!" ſaid the penitentiary, at length, "I dare not take upon me to aſſert that this is the Count di Bruno. If it is he, years have wrought deeply on his features. That the penitent was the Count di Bruno I have proof; he mentioned my name as his viſitor, and particular circumſtances known

only to the Count and myſelf; but that father Schedoni was the penitent, I repeat it, I dare not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm."</p>
                     <p>"But that dare I!" ſaid another voice; and Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, turning towards it, beheld the myſterious ſtranger advancing, his cowl now thrown back, and an air of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The tribunal was profoundly ſilent, but ſurprize, and a kind of reſtleſs expectation, marked every brow. Vivaldi was about to exclaim, "That is my inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er!" when the voice of the ſtranger checked him.</p>
                     <p>"Doſt thou know me?" ſaid he ſternly, to Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni, and his attitude became fixed.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni gave no reply.</p>
                     <p>"Doſt thou know me?" repeated the accuſer, in a ſteady ſolemn voice.</p>
                     <p>"Know thee?" uttered Schedoni, faintly,</p>
                     <p>"Doſt thou know this?" cried the ſtranger, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his voice, as he drew from his garment what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be a dagger. "Doſt thou know theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible ſtains?" ſaid he, lifting the poignard, and with an outſtretched arm, pointing it towards Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>The confeſſor turned away his face; it ſeemed as if his heart ſickened.</p>
                     <p>"With this dagger was thy brother ſlain!" ſaid the terrible ſtranger. "Shall I declare myſelf?"</p>
                     <p>Schedoni's courage forſook him, and he ſunk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a pillar of the hall for ſupport.</p>
                     <p>The Conſternation was now general: the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary appearance and conduct of the ſtranger ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtrike the greater part of the tribunal, a tribunal of the inquiſition itſelf! with diſmay. Several of the members roſe from their ſeats; others called aloud for the officials, who kept guard at the doors of the hall,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:032735_0480_0FF49863B95B5980"/>
and inquired who had admitted the ſtranger, while the vicar-general and a few inquiſitors converſed private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together, during which they frequently looked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Meanwhile the Monk remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the dagger in his graſp, and his eyes fixed on the Confeſſor, whoſe face was ſtill averted; and who yet ſupported himſelf againſt the pillar.</p>
                     <p>At length, the vicar-general called upon the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers who had riſen to return to their ſeats, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that the officials ſhould withdraw to their poſts.</p>
                     <p>"Holy brethern!" ſaid the vicar, we recommend to you, at this important hour, ſilence and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let the examination of the accuſed proceed; and hereafter let us inquire as to the admittance of the accuſer. For the preſent, ſuffer him alſo to have hearing and the father Schedoni to reply.</p>
                     <p>"We ſuffer him!" anſwered the tribunal, and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their heads.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, who, during the tumult, had ineffectually endeavoured to make himſelf heard, now profited by the pauſe which followed the aſſent of the inquiſitors, to claim attention: but the inſtant he ſpoke, ſeveral members impatiently bade that the examination ſhould proceed, and the grand-vicar was again oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to command ſilence, before the requeſt of Vivaldi could be underſtood. Permiſſion to ſpeak being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, "That perſon," ſaid he, pointing to the ſtranger, "is the ſame who viſited me in my priſon; and the dagger the ſame he now diſplays! It was he, who commanded me to ſummon the penitentiary An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaldo, and the father Schedoni. I have acquitted my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and have nothing further to do in this ſtruggle."</p>
                     <p>The tribunal was again agitated, and the murmurs of private converſation again prevailed.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile Schedoni appeared to have recovered ſome degree of ſelf-command; he raiſed himſelf, and

                     <p>"Holy fathers! the ſtranger who is now before you is an impoſtor! I will prove that my accuſer was once my friend;—you may perceive how much the diſcovery of his perfidy affects me. The charge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"<hi>Once</hi> thy friend!" replied the ſtranger, with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar emphaſis, "and what has made me thy enemy!

                     <p>"I know them not," replied Schedoni, "my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is unſtained."</p>
                     <p>"A brother's blood <hi>has</hi> ſtained it!" ſaid the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in a hollow voice.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, whoſe attention was now fixed upon Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni, obſerved a lived hue over-ſpread his complexion, and that his eyes were averted from this extraordinary perſon with horror; the ſpectre of his deceaſed brother could ſcarcely have called forth a ſtronger expreſſion. It was not immediately that he could command his voice; when he could, he again appealed to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,</p>
                     <p>"Holy fathers!" ſaid he, ſuffer me to defend my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf."</p>
                     <p>"Holy fathers!" ſaid the accuſer, with ſolemnity, "hear! hear what I ſhall unfold!"</p>
                     <p>Schedoni, who ſeemed to ſpeak by a ſtrong effort only, again addreſſed the inquiſitors; "I will prove," ſaid he, "that this evidence is not of a nature to be truſted."</p>
                     <p>"I will bring <hi>ſuch</hi> proof to the contrary, ſaid the monk "And here," pointing to Anſaldo, "is ſufficient teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,

                     <p>The court commanded ſilence, and upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"Recollect yourſelf," ſaid the grand inquiſitor:<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is of the utmoſt conſequence that you ſhould be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect on this point."</p>
                     <p>The penitentiary obſerved the ſtranger with deep attention, and then repeated his aſſertion.</p>
                     <p>"Have you never ſeen him before?" ſaid an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor.</p>
                     <p>"Never, to my knowledge!" replid Anſaldo.</p>
                     <p>The inquiſitors looked upon each other in ſilence.</p>
                     <p>"He ſpeaks the truth," ſaid the ſtranger.</p>
                     <p>This extraordinary fact did not fail to ſtrike the tribunal, and to aſtoniſh Vivaldi. Since the accuſer confirmed it, Vivaldi was at a loſs to underſtand the means by which he could have become acquainted with the guilt of Schedoni, who it was not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, would have acknowledged crimes of ſuch mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude as thoſe contained in the accuſation, to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, except, indeed, to his confeſſor, and this confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, it appeared, was ſo far from having betrayed his truſt to the accuſer, that he did not even know him. Vivaldi was no leſs perplexed as what would be the nature of the teſtimony with which the accuſer deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſupport his charges; but the pauſe of general amazement, which had permitted Vivaldi theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, was now at an end: the tribunal reſumed the examination, and the grand inquiſitor called aloud.</p>
                     <p>"You, Vincentio di Vivaldi, anſwer with exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the queſtions that ſhall be put to you."</p>
                     <p>He was then aſked ſome queſtions relative to the perſon who had viſited him in priſon. In his anſwers, Vivaldi was clear and conciſe, conſtantly affirming, that the ſtranger was the ſame who now accuſed Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="193" facs="unknown:032735_0483_0FF498C0B7010A18"/>
When the accuſer was interogated, he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without heſitation, that Vivaldi had ſpoken the truth. He was then aſked his motive for that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary viſit.</p>
                     <p>"It was," replied the monk, "that a murderer might be brought to juſtice."</p>
                     <p>"This," obſerved the grand inquiſitor, "might have been accompliſhed by fair and open accuſation. If you had known the charge to be juſt, it is probable that you would have appealed directly to this tribunal, inſtead of endeavouring inſiduouſly to obtain an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over the mind of a priſoner, and urging him to become the inſtrument of bringing the accuſed to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment."</p>
                     <p>"Yet I have not ſhrunk from diſcovery," obſerved the ſtranger, calmly; I have voluntarily appeared,"</p>
                     <p>At theſe words, Schedoni ſeemed again much agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and even drew his hood over his eyes.</p>
                     <p>"That is juſt," ſaid the grand inquiſitor, addreſſing the ſtranger:—but you have neither declared your name, or whence you come!"</p>
                     <p>To this remark the monk made no reply; but Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni, with reviving ſpirit, urged the circumſtance, in evidence of the malignity a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>"Wilt thou compel me to reveal my proof?" ſaid the ſtranger: "Dareſt thou to do ſo?"</p>
                     <p>"Why ſhould I fear thee?" anſwered Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>"Aſk thy conſcience, ſaid the ſtranger, with a teri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble frown.</p>
                     <p>The tribunal again ſuſpended the examination, and conſulted in private together.</p>
                     <p>To the laſt exhortation of the monk, Schedoni was ſilent. Vivaldi obſerved, that during this ſhort dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, the Confeſſor had never once turned his eyes towards the ſtranger, but apparently avoided him, as an object too affecting to be looked upon. He judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from this circumſtance, and from ſome other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:032735_0484_0FF49866DEECD6F0"/>
in his conduct, that Schedoni was guilty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the conſciouſneſs of guilt alone did not perfectly account, he thought, for the ſtrong emotion, with which he avoided the ſight of his accuſer—unleſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he knew the accuſer to have been, not only an accomplice in his crime, but the actual aſſaſſin. In this caſe, it appeared natural even for the ſtern and ſubtle Schedoni to betray his horror, on beholding the perſon of the murderer, with the very inſtrument of the crime in his graſp. On the other hand, Vivaldi could not but perceive it to be highly improbable, that the very man who had really committed the deed, ſhould come voluntarily into a court of juſtice, for the purpoſe of accuſing his employer; that he ſhould dare publicly to accuſe him, whoſe guilt, however enormous, was not more ſo than his own.</p>
                     <p>The extraordinary manner, alſo, in which the accuſer had proceeded in the commencement of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, engaged Vivaldi's conſideration; his apparent reluctance to be ſeen in this proceſs, and the artful and myſterious plan by which he had cauſed Schedoni to be ſummoned before the tribunal, and had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured that he ſhould be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> accuſed by Anſaldo, indicated, at leaſt to Vivaldi's apprehenſion, the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of guilt, and, ſtill more, that malice, and a thirſt of vengeance, had inſtigated his conduct in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. If the ſtranger had been actuated only by a love of juſtice, it appeared that he would not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded toward it in a way thus dark and circuitous, but have ſought it by the uſual proceſs, and have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the proofs which he even now aſſerted he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, of Schedoni's crimes. In addition to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſeemed to ſtrengthen a ſuppoſition of the guiltleſſneſs of Schedoni was that, of the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer's avoiding to acknowledge who he was, and whence he came. But Vivaldi pauſed again upon this point; it appeared to be inexplicable, and he could not ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:032735_0485_0FF498C24206E3F0"/>
why the accuſer had adopted a ſtyle of ſecrecy, which, if, he perſiſted in it, muſt probably defeat the very purpoſe of the accuſation; for Vivaldi did not believe that the tribunal would condemn a priſoner upon the teſtimony of a perſon, who, when called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould publicly refuſe to reveal himſelf, even to them. Yet the accuſer muſt certainly have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this circumſtance before he ventured into court; notwithſtanding which, he had appeared!</p>
                     <p>Theſe reflections led Vivaldi to various conjectures relative to the viſit he had himſelf received from the monk, the dream that had preceded it, the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means by which he had obtained admittance to the priſon, the declaration of the continels, that not any perſon had paſſed the door, and many other unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable particulars; and while Vivaldi now looked upon the wild phyſiognomy of the ſtranger, he almoſt fancied, as he had formerly done, that he beheld ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing not of this earth.</p>
                     <p>"I have heard of the ſpirit of the murdered." ſaid he, to himſelf—"reſtleſs for juſtice, becoming viſible in our world—" But Vivaldi checked the imperfect thought, and, though his imagination inclined him to the marvellous and to admit ideas which, filling and expanded all the faculties of the ſoul, produce feelings that partake of the ſublime, he now reſiſted the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity, and diſmiſſed, as abſurd, a ſuppoſition which had begun to thrill his every nerve with horror. He awaited, however the reſult of the examination, and what might be the further conduct of the ſtranger, with intenſe expectation.</p>
                     <p>When the tribunal had, at length, finally determined on the method of their proceedings, Schedoni was firſt called upon, and examined as to his knowledge of the accuſer." It was the ſame inquiſitor who had formerly interrogated Vivaldi, that now ſpoke. "You, father Schedoni, a monk of the Spirito Santo convent, at Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,

                     <p>"I anſwer not to the title of Count di Bruno," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Confeſſor, "but I will declare that I know this man. His name is Nicola di Zampari."</p>
                     <p>"What is his condition?"</p>
                     <p>"He is a monk of the Dominican convent of the Spirito Santo," replied Schedoni. "Of his family I know little."</p>
                     <p>Where have you ſeen him?"</p>
                     <p>"In the city of Naples, where he has reſided, during ſome years, beneath the ſame roof with me, when I was of the convent of San Angiolo, and ſince that time, in the Spirito Santo."</p>
                     <p>"You have been a reſident at the San Angiolo?" ſaid the inquiſitor.</p>
                     <p>"I have," replied Schedoni; "and it was there that we firſt lived together in the confidence of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip."</p>
                     <p>"You now perceive how ill placed was that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence," ſaid the inquiſitor, "and repent, no doubt, of your imprudence?"</p>
                     <p>The very Schedoni was not entrapped by this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
                     <p>"I muſt lament a diſcovery of ingratitude," he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, calmy, "but the ſubjects of my confidence were too pure to give occaſion for repentance."</p>
                     <p>"This Nicola di Zampari was ungrateful, then? You had rendered him ſervices? ſaid the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor.</p>

                     <p>"I call upon you, in the name of your deceaſed bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther," ſaid the accuſer, "to reveal the cauſe of my enmity!"</p>

Vivaldi, ſtruck by the tone in which the ſtranger ſpoke this, turned his eyes upon him, but knew not how to interpret the emotion viſible on his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</p>
                     <p>The inquiſitor commanded Schedoni to explain himſelf; the latter could not immediately reply, but, when he recovered a ſelf-command he added,</p>
                     <p>"I promiſed this accuſer, this Nicola di Zampari, to aſſiſt his preferment with what little intereſt I poſſeſſed; it was but little. Some ſucceeding cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances encouraged me to believe that I could more than fulfil my promiſe. His hopes were eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in the fulneſs of expectation—he was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, for I was myſelf deceived, by the perſon in whom I had truſted. To the diſappointment of a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leric man, I am to attibute this unjuſt accuſation."</p>
                     <p>Schedoni pauſed, and an air of diſſatisfaction and anxiety appeared upon his features. His accuſer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſilent, but a malicious ſmile announced his triumph.</p>
                     <p>You muſt declare, alſo the ſervices," ſaid the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor, "which merited the reward you promiſed."</p>
                     <p>"Thoſe ſervices were ineſtimable to me," reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Schedoni, after a momentary heſitation; "though they coſt di Zampari little: they were the conſolations of ſympathy, the intelligence of friendſhip, which he adminiſtered, and which gratitude told me never could be repaid."</p>

                     <p>Schedoni was ſilent. Vivaldi could not judge whether the pride which occaſioned his ſilence was that of innocence or of remorſe.</p>

                     <p>To theſe queſtions, though formally delivered from the tribunal, Schedoni did not deign to reply.</p>
                     <p>"It appears, then," ſaid the vicar-general, "that the accuſer and the accuſed were once accomplices."</p>
                     <p>The inquiſitor objected, that this did not certainly appear; and that, on the contrary, Schedoni ſeemed to

have given his laſt queſtions in deſpair; an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which Vivaldi thought extraordinary from an Inquiſitor.</p>
                     <p>"Be it <hi>accomplices,</hi> if it ſo pleaſe you," ſaid Schedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, bowing to the grand vicar, without noticing the inquiſitor: you may call us accomplices—but, I ſay, that we were <hi>friends.</hi> Since it is neceſſary to my own peace, that I ſhould more fully explain ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances attending our intimacy, I will own that my accuſer was occaſionally my agent, and aſſiſted in preſerving the dignity of an illuſtrious family at Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the family of the Vivaldi. And there, holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther," added Schedoni, pointing to Vincentio, "is the ſon of that ancient houſe, for whom I have attempted ſo much!"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi was almoſt overwhelmed by this confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Schedoni, though he had already ſuſpected a part of the truth. In the ſtranger he believed he ſaw the ſlanderer of Ellena, the baſe inſtrument of the Marcheſa's policy, and of Schedoni's ambition; and the whole of his conduct at Paluzzi, at leaſt, ſeemed now intelligible. In Schedoni he beheld his ſecret ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, and the inexorable enemy whom he believed to have occaſioned the impriſonment of Ellena. At this latter conſideration, all circumſpection, all prudence, forſook him; he declared, with energy, that, from what Schedoni had juſt acknowledged to be his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, he knew him for his ſecret accuſer, and the accuſer alſo, of Ellena di Roſalba; and he called upon the tribunal to examine into the Confeſſor's motives for the accuſation, and afterwards to give hearing to what he would himſelf unfold.</p>
                     <p>To this the grand-vicar replied, that Vivaldi's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal would be taken into conſideration: and he then ordered that the preſent buſineſs ſhould proceed.</p>
                     <p>The inquiſitor, addreſſing Schedoni ſaid,—"The diſintereſted nature of your friendſhip is now ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently

Of you we aſk no more, but turn to father Nicola di Zampari, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what he has to ſay in ſupport of his accuſation.

                     <p>"Still theſe are not proofs, but aſſertions," obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the vicar-general, "and the firſt forbids our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the ſecond.—If as you declare, Schedoni himſelf acknowleaged to you that he was Count di Bruno, you muſt have been to him the intimate friend he has declared you were, or he would not have co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The vicar-general ſpoke again, "Nicola di Zam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pari, I call upon you to ſay, why, if your proof of Schedoni's guilt is ſo clear, as the confeſſion of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſin himſelf muſt make it, why you thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſummon father Anſaldo to atteſt the crimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of the Count di Bruno! the dying confeſſion of the aſſaſſin is certainly of more weight than any other evidence."</p>
                     <p>"I ſummoned the father Anſaldo," replied the ſtranger, "as a means of proving that Schedoni is the Count di Bruno.

                     <p>"But that is more than I will engage to prove," replied Anſaldo. "I know it was the Count di Bruno who confeſſed to me, but I do not know that the father Schedoni, who is now before me, was the perſon who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Conſcientiouſly obſerved!" ſaid the vicar-general, interruptihg the ſtranger, who was about to reply, but you, Nicola di Zampari, have not on this head, been ſufficiently explicit.

                     <p>"Reverend father, that is the point I was about to explain," replied the monk. "I myſelf accompanied Schedoni, on the eve of San Marco, to the church of the <hi>Santa Maria del Pianto,</hi> at the very hour when the confeſſion is ſaid to have been made.

                     <p>"Here is no proof," ſaid the vicar-general: "other friars, of that order, might confeſs at the ſame hour, in the ſame church."</p>
                     <p>"But here is a ſtrong preſumption for proof," ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the inquiſitor. "Holy father, we muſt judge from probabilities, as well as from proof."</p>

                     <p>"Are theſe the ſentiments of an Inquiſitor!" ſaid Vivaldi to himſelf, "can ſuch glorious candour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear amidſt the tribunal of an Inquiſition!" Tears fel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"I have," replied the monk, with aſperity "When I had left Schedoni in the church, I lingered without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

When on the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day, I queſtioned Schedoni as to his ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the Black Penitents, his anſwers were dark, but emphatic, and he extorted from me a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, thoughtleſs that I was! never to diſcloſe his viſit of the preceeding evening to the <hi>Santa del Pian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi> I then certainly diſcovered who was the penitent,"</p>

                     <p>"No father. I underſtood him to be the penitent to whom the report alluded, but I had no ſuſpicion of the nature of his crimes, till the aſſaſſin began his confeſſion, the concluſion of which clearly explained the ſubject of Schedoni's; it explained alſo his motive for endeavouring ever after to attach me to his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt."</p>
                     <p>"You have now, ſaid the Vicar-general," you have now confeſſed yourſelf a member of the covent of the Spirito Santo at Naples, and an intimate of the father Schedoni; one whom for many years he has endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to attach to him.

you denied all this; the negative to the latter circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was given, it is true, by implication only; but to the firſt, a direct and abſolute denial was pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!"</p>

                     <p>"Nichola di Zampari has ſpoken the truth. It is not many weeks ſince he entered the holy office. A certificate from his convent at Naples bears teſtimony to the truth of what I advance, and procured him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance here."</p>
                     <p>"It is extraordinary, that you ſhould not have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed your knowledge of this perſon before!" ſaid the vickar general.</p>

                     <p>"I comprehend you, ſaid the vicar-general, "but I do neither approve of, nor perceive any neceſſity for your countenancing the ſubterfuge of this Nicola di Zampari, relative to his identity. But more of this in private."</p>
                     <p>"I will explain all there," anſwered the Inquiſitor.</p>
                     <p>"It appears then" reſumed the vicar-general, ſpeaking aloud, "that this Nicola di Zampari was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the friend and confidant of father Schedoni, whom he now accuſes. The accuſation is evidently malicious; whether it be alſo falſe, remains to be decided. A material queſtion naturally ariſes out of

                     <p>The monk's viſage brightened with the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of anticipated triumph, and he immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
                     <p>"Moſt holy father! as ſoon as I aſcertained the crime, I prepared to proſecute the perpetrator of it—A ſhort period only has elapſed ſince the aſſaſſin gave his confeſſion. In this interval I diſcovered, in theſe priſons, Signor Vivaldi, and immediately compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by whoſe means he was confined. I knew enough both of the accuſer and the accuſed, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand which of theſe was innocent, and had then a double motive for cauſing Schedoni to be ſummoned;—I wiſhed equally to deliver the innocent and puniſh the criminal. The queſtion as to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for my becoming the enemy of him, who was once my friend, is already anſwered: it was a ſenſe of juſtice, not a ſuggeſtion of malice."</p>
                     <p>The grand-vicar ſmiled, but aſked no further; and this long examination concluded with committing Schedoni again into cloſe cuſtody, till full evidence ſhould be obtained of his guilt, or his innocence ſhould appear. Reſpecting the manner of his wife's death, there was yet no other evidence than that which was aſſerted to be his own confeſſion, which though perhaps ſufficient to condemn a criminal before the tribunal of the Inquiſition, was not enough to ſatisfy the preſent vicar-general, who gave direction, that means might be employed towards obtaining proof of each article of the accuſation; in order that, Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni be acquitted of the charge of having murdered his brother, documents might appear for proſecuting him reſpecting the death of his wife.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni, when he withdrew from the hall, bowed reſpectfully to the tribunal, and whether, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding late appearances, he were innocent, or that

                     <p>WHEN the night of Schedoni's trial arrived, Vivaldi was again ſummoned to the hall of the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Every circumſtance was now arranged accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the full ceremonies of the place; the members of the tribunal were more numerous than formerly at the examinations; the chief inquiſitors wore habits of a faſhion different from thoſe, which before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed them, and their turbans, of a ſingular form and larger ſize, ſeemed to give an air of ſterner fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to their features. The hall, as uſual, was hung with black, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every perſon who appeared there, whether inquiſitor, official, witneſs or priſoner, was habited in the ſame diſmal hue, which together with the kind of light diffuſed through the chamber from lamps hung high in the vaulted roof, and from torches held by parties of officials who kept watch at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral doors, and in different parts of this immenſe hall, gave a character of gloomy ſolemnity to the aſſembly, which was almoſt horrofic.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi was ſituated in a place, whence he beheld the whole of the tribunal, and could diſtinguiſh what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was paſſing in the hall. The countenance of every member was now fully diſplayed to him by the torchmen, who, arranged at the ſteps of the platform on which the three chief inquiſitors were elevated, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:032735_0499_0FF46EE0CD428030"/>
in a ſemicircle on either hand of the place oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied by the inferior members. The red glare, which the torches threw upon the latter, certainly did not ſoften the expreſſion of faces, for the moſt part ſculptured by paſſions of dark malignity, or fiercer cruelty? and Vivaldi could not bear even to examine them long.</p>
                     <p>Before the bar of the tribunal, he diſtinguiſhed Schedoni, and little did he ſuſpect that in him, a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal brought thither to anſwer for the guilt of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der—the murder of a brother, and of a wife, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the parent of Ellena di Roſalba!</p>
                     <p>Near Schedoni was ſeated the penitentiary Anſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do: the Roman prieſt, who was to be a principal wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and father Nicola di Zampari, upon whom Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi could not even now look without experiencing ſome what of the awe, which had prevailed over his mind when he was inclined to conſider the ſtranger, rather as the viſion of another world, than as a being of this. The ſame wild and indeſcribable character ſtill diſtinguiſhed his air, his very look and movement, and Vivaldi could not but believe that ſomething in the higheſt degree extraordinary would yet be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered concerning him.</p>
                     <p>The witneſſes being called over, Vivaldi under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the he was placed among them, though he had only repeated the words which father Nicola had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and which, ſince Nicola himſelf was preſent as a witneſs againſt Schedoni, he did not perceive could be in the leaſt material on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he trial.</p>
                     <p>When Vivaldi had, in his turn, anſwered to his name, a voice, burſting forth from a ſtiſtant part of the hall, exclaimed, "It is my maſter! my <hi>dear</hi> maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter!" and on directing his eyes whence it came, he perceived the faithful Paulo ſtruggling with his guard. Vivaldi called to him to be patient, and to forbear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, an exhortation, however, which ſerved only
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:032735_0500_0FF4992E74F2C770"/>
to increaſe the efforts of the ſervant for liberty, and in the next inſtant he broke from the graſp of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials, and darting towards Vivaldi, fell at his feet, ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, and claſping his knees, and exclaiming, "O my maſter! my maſter! have I found you at laſt?"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, much affected by this meeting as Paulo, could not immediately ſpeak. He would, however, have raiſed and embraced his affectionate ſervant, but Paulo, ſtill clinging to his knees and ſobbing, was ſo much agitated that he ſcarcely underſtood any thing ſaid to him, and to the kind aſſurances and gentle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances of Vivaldi conſtantly replied as if to the officers, whom he fancied to be forcing him away.</p>
                     <p>"Remember your ſituation, Paulo," ſaid Vivaldi, "conſider mine alſo, and be governed by prudence."</p>
                     <p>"You ſhall not force me hence!" cried Paulo, "you can take my life only once; if I muſt die, it ſhall be here."</p>
                     <p>"Recollect yourſelf, Paulo, and he compoſed. Your life, I truſt, is in no danger."</p>
                     <p>Paulo looked up, and again, burſting into a paſſion of tears, repeated, "O! my maſter! my maſter! where have you been all this while? are you indeed alive? I thought I never ſhould ſee you again! I have dreamt an hundred times that you were dead and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried! and I wiſhed to be dead and buried with you. I thought you was gone out of this world into the next. I feared you was gone to heaven, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved we ſhould never meet again. But now, I ſee you once more, and know that you live! O! my maſter! my maſter!"</p>
                     <p>The officers who had followed Paulo, now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to withdraw him, he became more outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous.</p>
                     <p>"Do your worſt at once," ſaid Paulo, "but you ſhall find tough work of it, if you try to force me from
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:032735_0501_0FF498D1A32C7C70"/>
hence; ſo you had better be contented with killing me here."</p>
                     <p>The incenſed officials were laying violent hands upon him, when Vivaldi interpoſed. "I entreat, I ſupplicate you, ſaid he, "that you will ſuffer him to remain near me."</p>
                     <p>"It is impoſſible," replied an officer, "we dare not."</p>
                     <p>"I will promiſe that he ſhall not even ſpeak to me, if you will allow him to be near," added Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Not ſpeak to you, maſter!" exclaimed Paulo, "but I will ſtay by you, and ſpeak to you as long as I like, till my laſt gaſp. Let them do their worſt at once; I defy them all, and all the devils of inquiſitors it their heels too, to force me away. I can die but once, and they ought to be ſatisfied with that,—ſo what is there to be afraid of? Not ſpeak!</p>
                     <p>"He knows not what he ſays," ſaid Vivaldi to the officials, while he endeavoured to ſilence Paulo with his hand: "I am certain that he will ſubmit to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſhall require of him, and will be entirely ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; or if he does ſpeak now and then, it ſhall be only in a whiſper."</p>
                     <p>"A whiſper!" ſaid an officer, ſneeringly, "do you ſuppoſe, Signor, that any perſon is ſuffered to ſpeak in a whiſper here?"</p>
                     <p>"A whiſper!" ſhouted Paulo, "I ſcorn to ſpeak in a whiſper. I will ſpeak ſo loud, that every word I ſay ſhall ring in the ears of all theſe old black devils on the benches yonder; aye, and thoſe on that moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebank ſtage too, that ſit there looking ſo grim and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry as if they longed to tear us in pieces. They"—</p>
                     <p>"Silence," ſaid Vivaldi, with emphaſis: "Paulo, I command you to be ſilent."</p>
                     <p>"They ſhall know a bit of my mind," continued Paulo, without noticing Vivaldi: "I will tell them what they have to expect for all their cruel uſage of
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:032735_0502_0FF499389842C8F0"/>
my poor maſter. Where do they expect to go when they die. I wonder? though for that matter, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go to a worſe place than they are in already, and I ſuppoſe it is, knowing that, which makes them not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of being ever ſo wicked. They ſhall hear a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle plain truth, for once in their lives, however, they ſhall hear"—</p>
                     <p>During the whole of this harangue, Vivaldi, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed for the conſequence of ſuch imprudent, though honeſt indignation, had been uſing all poſſible, effort to ſilence him, and was the more alarmed, ſince the officials made no further attempt to interrupt Paulo, a forbearance, which Vivaldi attributed to malignity, and to a wiſh that Paulo might be entrapped by his own act. At length, he made himſelf heard.</p>
                     <p>"I <hi>entreat,</hi>" ſaid Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>Paulo ſtopped for a moment.</p>
                     <p>"Paulo!" rejoined Vivaldi, earneſtly; "do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"Love my maſter!" ſaid Paulo reſentfully, without allowing Vivaldi to finiſh his ſentence, "Have I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> gone through fire and water for him? or, what is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> my maſter!" If you believe, Signor, that any thing, elſe made me come here, into theſe diſmal holes, you are quite entirely out; and when they have made an end of me, as I ſuppoſe they will do, before all is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, you will, perhaps, think better of me than to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that I came here for my own pleaſure."</p>
                     <p>'All that may be as you ſay, Paulo,' replied Vivaldi coldly, while he, with difficulty, commanded his tears "but your immediate ſubmiſſion is the only conduct that can convince me of the ſincerity of your profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. I <hi>entreat</hi> you to be ſilent."</p>
                     <p>"<hi>Entreat</hi> me!" ſaid Paulo, "O my maſter! what
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:032735_0503_0FF498D3292589F0"/>
have I done that it ſhould come to this? <hi>Entreat</hi> me!" he repeated, ſobbing.</p>
                     <p>"You will then give me this proof of your attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?" aſked Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Do not uſe ſuch a heart-breaking word again, maſter," replied Paulo, while he daſhed the tears from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"You ſubmit to what I require then, Paulo?"</p>
                     <p>"Aye, Signor, if—if it is even to kneel, at the feet of that devil of an Inquiſitor, yonder."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall only require you to be ſilent," replied Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, "and you may then be permitted to remain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"Not a ſyllable! Paulo," interrupted Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Only juſt ſay, maſter"—</p>
                     <p>"Not a word, I entreat you!" added Vivaldi, "or you will be removed immediately."</p>
                     <p>"His removal does not depend on that," ſaid one of the officials, breaking from his watchful ſilence he muſt go, and that without more delay."</p>
                     <p>"What! after I have promiſed not to open my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"There <hi>is</hi> no pretence, and there <hi>was</hi> no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment," replied the man ſharply, "ſo obey directly, or will be the worſe for you."</p>
                     <p>The officials were provoked, and Paulo became <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> more enraged and clamorous, till, at length, the roar reached the tribunal, at the other end of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>At length, after much difficulty, a ſort of compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made, and Paulo being ſoothed by his maſter into ſome degree of compliance, was ſuffered to remain within a ſhort diſtance of him.</p>

                     <p>It would be difficult for a candid mind to believe how a conduct ſo reaſonable could poſſibly excite hatred in any breaſt, or that the power of ſelfiſhneſs could ſo far warp any underſtanding, as to induce Marinella, whom we will, in future again call Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni, to look upon his brother with deteſtation, becauſe he had refuſed to ruin himſelf that his kinſman might level! Yet it is certain that Schedoni, terming the neceſſary prudence of di Bruno to be meanneſs and cold inſenſibility to the comfort of others, ſuffered full as much reſentment towards him from ſyſtem, as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The rancour this excited was cheriſhed by innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable circumſtances, and ripened by envy, that meaneſt and moſt maligment of the human paſſions; by envy of di Bruno's bleſſings, of an unencumbered eſtate, and, of a beautiful wife, he was tempted to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate the deed, which might transfer theſe bleſſings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="216" facs="unknown:032735_0506_0FF4993BA5183358"/>
confide the conduct or the crime to this man, who was to purchaſe a little habitation on the remote she of the Adriatic, and, with a certain ſtipend, to reſide there. The ruinous dwelling, to which Ellena had been carried, as its ſolitary ſituation ſuited Schedoni's views, was taken for him.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni, who had good intelligence of all di Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no's movement, acquainted Spalatro, from time to time with his exact ſituation; and it was after di Bruno, on his return, had croſſed the Adriatic, from Raguſi to Manfredonia, and was entering upon the woods of the Garganus, that Spalatro, with his comrade overtook him. They fired at the Count and his attendants, who were only a valet, and a guide of the country<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and concealed among the thickets, they ſecurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the attack. The ſhot did not immediately ſucceed, and the Count, looking round to diſcover his enemy, prepared to defend himſelf, but the firing was ſo rapidly ſuſtained, that, at length, both di Bruno and his ſervant fell, covered with wounds. The guide fled.</p>
                     <p>The unfortunate travellers were buried by their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſins on the ſpot; but, whether the ſuſpicion which attends upon the conſciouſneſs of guilt prompted Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latro to guard againſt every poſſibility of being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by the accomplice of his crime, or whatever was the motive, he returned to the foreſt alone; and, ſhrouded by night, removed the bodies to a pit, which he had prepared under the flooring of the houſe where he lived; thus diſplacing all proof, ſhould his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice hereafter point out to juſtice the ſpot in which he had aſſiſted to depoſit the mangled remains of di Bruno.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni contrived a plauſible hiſtory of the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck of his brother upon the Adriatic, and of the loſs of the whole crew; and, as no perſons but the aſſaſſins were acquainted with the real cauſe of his death, the
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:032735_0507_0FF498DE978EF9B0"/>
guide, who had fled, and the people at the only town he had paſſed through, ſince he landed, being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant even of the name of di Bruno, there was not any circumſtance to contradict the falſhood. It was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally credited, and even the widow of the Count had, perhaps, never doubted its truth; or if, after her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled marriage with Schedoni, his conduct did awaken a ſuſpicion, it was too vague to produce any ſerious conſequence.</p>
                     <p>During the reading of Spalatro's confeſſion, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly at the concluſion of it, the ſurprize and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may of Schedoni were too powerful for concealment; and it was not the leaſt conſiderable part of his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that Spalatro ſhould have come to Rome for the purpoſe of making theſe depoſitions; but further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration gave him a conjecture of the truth.</p>
                     <p>The account, which Spalatro had given of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for this journey to the prieſt, was, that, having lately underſtood Schedoni to be reſident at Rome, he had followed him thither, with an intention of reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his conſcience by an acknowledgment of his own crimes, and a diſcloſure of Schedoni's. This, however, was not exactly the fact. The deſign of Spalatro was to extort money from the guilty Confeſſor; a deſign, from which the latter beleived he had protected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as well as from every other evil conſequence, when he miſſed his late accomplice, reſpecting his place of reſidence; little foreſeeing that the very artifice, which ſhould ſend this man in ſearch of him to Rome, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Naples, would be the means of bringing his crimes before the public.</p>
                     <p>Spalatro had followed the ſteps of Schedoni as far as the town at which he ſteps, on the firſt night of his journey; and, having there paſſed him, had reached the villa di Cambruſca, when, perceiving the Confeſſor approaching, he had taken ſhelter from obſervation, within the ruin. The motive, which before made
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:032735_0508_0FF4993D2A7AE0C0"/>
him ſhrink from notice, had contributed, and ſtill did ſo, to a ſuſpicion that he aimed at the life of Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni, who in wounding him, believed he had ſaved himſelf from an aſſaſſin. The wounds, however, of Spalatro did not ſo much diſable him, but that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded towards Rome from the town whence the parting road had conducted his maſter towards Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                     <p>The fatigue of a long journey, performed chiefly on foot, in Spalatro's wounded condition, occaſioned a fever, that terminated together his journey and his life; and in his laſt hours he had unburdened his conſcience by a full confeſſion of his guilt. The prieſt, who, on this occaſion, had been ſent for alarmed by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the confeſſion, ſince it implicated a living perſon, called in a friend as witneſs to the depoſitions This witneſs was father Nicola, the former intimate of Schedoni, and who was of a character to rejoice in any diſcovery, which might puniſh a man from whoſe repeated promiſes he had received only ſevere diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni now perceived that all his deſigns againſt Spalatro had failed, and he had meditated more than have yet been fully diſcloſed. It may be remembered, that on parting with the peaſant, his conductor, the Confeſſor, gave him a ſtiletto to defend him, as he ſaid, from the attack of Spalatro, in caſe of encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him on the road. The point of this inſtrument was tipped with poiſon; ſo that a ſcratch from it was ſufficient to inflict death. Schedoni had, for many years ſecretly carried about him ſuch an envenomed inſtrument, for reaſons known only to himſelf. He had hoped, that, ſhould the peaſant meet Spalatra, and he provoked to defend himſelf, this ſtiletto would ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the life of his accomplice, and relieve him from all probability of diſcovery, ſince the other aſſaſſin, whom he employed, had been dead ſeveral years. The
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:032735_0509_0FF498E01EEF8A58"/>
expedient failed in every reſpect; the peaſant did not even ſee Spalatro; and, before he reached his home, he luckily loſt the fatal ſtiletto, which, as he had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himſelf to be acquainted with ſome circumſtances connected with the crimes of Schedoni, the Confeſſor would have wiſhed him to keep, from the chance, that he might ſome time injure himſelf in uſing it. The poignard, as he had no proper means of faſtening it to his dreſs, had fallen, and was carried away by the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent he was croſſing at that moment.</p>
                     <p>But, if Schedoni had been ſhocked by the confeſſion of the aſſaſſin, his diſmay was conſiderably greater, when a new witneſs was brought forward, and he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an ancient domeſtic of his houſe. This man identified Schedoni for Ferando Count di Bruno, with whom he had lived as a ſervant after the death of the Count his brother. And not only did he bear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the perſon of Schedoni, but to the death of the Counteſs, his wife. Giovanni declared himſelf to be one of the domeſtics who had aſſiſted in convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to her apartment, after ſhe had been ſtruck by the poignard of Schedoni, and who had afterwards at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her funeral in the church of the Santa del Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acoli, a convent near the late reſidence of di Bruno. He further affirmed, that the phyſicians had reported her death to be in conſequence of the wound ſhe had received, and he bore witneſs to the flight of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, previous to the death of the Counteſs, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the aſſaſſination, and that he had never publicly appeared upon his eſtate ſince that period.</p>
                     <p>An inquiſitor aſked, whether any meaſures had been taken by the relations of the deceaſed lady toward a proſecution of the Count.</p>
                     <p>The witneſs replied, that a long ſearch had been made for the Count, for ſuch a purpoſe, but that he had wholly eluded diſcovery, and that, of courſe, no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:032735_0510_0FF49946F7238A20"/>
ſtep had been taken in the affair. This reply ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to occaſion diſſatisfaction;—the tribunal was ſilent, and ſeemed to heſitate: the vicar-general then addreſſed the witneſs.</p>
                     <p>"How can you be certain that the perſon now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, calling himſelf father Schedoni, is the Count di Bruno, your former maſter, if you have never ſeen him during the long interval of years you mention?"</p>
                     <p>Giovanni, without heſitation, anſwered,—that though years had worn the features of the Count he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected them the moment he beheld him; and not the Count only, but the perſon of the penitentiary Anſaldo, whom he had ſeen a frequent viſiter at the houſe of di Bruno, though his appearance, alſo, was conſiderably changed by time, and by the eccleſiaſtical habit which he now wore.</p>
                     <p>The vicar-general ſeemed ſtill to doubt the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this man, till Anſaldo himſelf, on being call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon remembered him to have been a ſervant of the Count, though he could not identify the Count himſelf.</p>
                     <p>The grand inquiſitor remarked, that it was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary he ſhould recollect the face of the ſervant, yet forget that of the maſter, with whom he had liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in habits of intimacy. To this Anſaldo replied, that the ſtronger paſſions of Schedoni, together with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> particular habits of life, might reaſonably be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have wrought a greater change upon the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Count than the character and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Giovanni's could have effected on his.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni, not without reaſon, was appalled, on the appearance of this ſervant, whoſe further teſtimony gave ſuch clearneſs and force to ſome other parts of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the tribunal pronounced ſentence upon Schedoni, as the murderer of the Count his brother; and as this, the firſt charge, was ſufficient for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to death, they did not proceed upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that which related to his wife.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="221" facs="unknown:032735_0511_0FF498E1AA699310"/>
The emotion betrayed by Schedoni on the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the laſt witneſs, and during the delivery of the evidence, diſappeared when his fate became certain; and when the dreadful ſentence of the law was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, it made no viſible impreſſion on his mind. From that moment, his firmneſs or his hardihood ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forſook him.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, who witneſſed his condemnation, appeared infinitely more affected by it than himſelf, and, though in revealing the circumſtance of father Nicola's ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which had eventually led to the diſcovery of Schedoni's crimes, he had not been left a choice in his conduct, he felt, at this moment, as miſerable as if he had actually borne witneſs againſt the life of a fellow being: what, then, would have been his feelings, had he been told that this Schedoni, thus condemned, was the father of Ellena di Roſalba! But, whatever theſe might be, he was ſoon condemned to experience them. One of the moſt powerful of Schedoni's paſſions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared even in this laſt ſcene; and as, in quitting the tribunal, he paſſed near Vivaldi he uttered theſe words—"In me you have murdered the father of Ellena di Roſalba!</p>
                     <p>Not with any hope that the interceſſion of Vivaldi, himſelf alſo a priſoner, could in the leaſt mitigate a ſentence pronounced by the Inquiſition, did he ſay this, but for the purpoſe of revenging himſelf for the evil, which Vivaldi's evidence had contributed to produce, and inflicting the exquiſite miſery ſuch information muſt give. The attempt ſucceeded too well.</p>
                     <p>At firſt, indeed, Vivaldi judged this to be only the deſperate aſſertion of a man, who believed his laſt chance of eſcaping the rigour of the law to reſt with him; and, at the mention of Ellena, forgetting every precaution, he loudly demanded to know her ſituation. Schedoni, throwing upon him an horrible ſmile of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and deriſion, was paſſing forward without
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:032735_0512_0FF49948827F8E90"/>
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, but Vivaldi, unable to ſupport this ſtate of uncertainty, aſked permiſſion, of the tribunal to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe a few mements, with the priſoner; a requeſt which was granted with extreme reluctance, and only on condition that the converſation ſhould be public.</p>
                     <p>To Vivaldi's queſtions, as to the ſituation of Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Schedoni only replied, that ſhe was his daughter, and the ſolemnity, which accompanied theſe repeated aſſertions, though it failed to convince Vivaldi of this truth, occaſioned him agonizing doubt and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but when the Confeſſor, perceiving the policy of diſcloſing her place of reſidence to Vivaldi, ſoftened from his deſire of vengeance of ſecure the intereſt of his family, and named the <hi>Santa della Pieta</hi> as her preſent aſylum, the joy of ſuch intelligence overcame for a ſhort time, every other conſideration.</p>
                     <p>To this dialogue, however, the officials put a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy concluſion; Schedoni was led back to his cell, and Vivaldi was ſoon after ordered to his former cloſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement.</p>
                     <p>But Paulo became again outrageous, when he was about to be ſeparated from his maſter, till the latter, having petitioned the tribunal, that his ſervant might accompany him to his priſon, and received an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute refuſal, endeavoured to calm the violence of his deſpair. He fell at his maſter's feet, and ſhed tears, but he uttered no further complaints. When he roſe he turned his eyes in ſilence upon Vivaldi, and they ſeemed to ſay "Dear maſter! I ſhall never ſee you more!" and with this ſad expreſſion, he continued to gaze on him till he had left the hall.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi notwithſtanding the various ſubjects of his diſtreſs, could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> bear to meet the piteous looks of this poor man, and he withdrew his eyes; yet, at every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtep he took, they conſtantly returned to his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervant, till the doors folded him from ſight.</p>
                     <p>When he had quitted the hull, Vivaldi pleaded,
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:032735_0513_0FF498EB50750EF8"/>
however hopeleſsly, to the officials, in favour of Paulo, entreating that they would ſpeak to the perſons who kept guard over him, and prevail with them to ſhew him every allowable indulgence.</p>
                     <p>"No indulgence can be allowed him," replied one of the men, "except bread and water, and the liberty of walking in his cell."</p>
                     <p>"No <hi>other!</hi>" ſaid Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"None," repeated the official. "This priſoner has been near getting one of his guards into a ſcrape already, for, ſomehow or other, he ſo talked him over, and won upon him, (for he is but a young one here) that the man let him have a light, and a pen and ink; but luckily, it was found out before any harm was done."</p>
                     <p>"And what became of this honeſt; fellow?" inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Honeſt! he was none ſo honeſt, either Signor, if he could not mind his duty."</p>
                     <p>"Was he puniſhed, then?"</p>
                     <p>"No, Signor," replied the man, pauſing, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back upon the long avenue they were paſſing, to inquire whether he was obſerved to hold this conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with a priſoner: "no, Signor, he was a younk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſo they let him off for once, and ſent him to guard a man, who was not ſo full of his coaxing ways."</p>
                     <p>"Paulo made him merry, perhaps?" aſked Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi. "What were the coaxing ways you ſpoke of?"</p>
                     <p>"Merry, Signor! no! he made him cry, and that was as bad."</p>
                     <p>"Indeed!" ſaid Vivaldi, "The man muſt have been here, than, a very ſhort time."</p>
                     <p>"Not more than a month, or ſo, Signor."</p>
                     <p>"But the coaxing ways you talked of," repeated Vivaldi, "what were they;—a ducat, or ſo?"</p>
                     <p>"A ducat!" exclaimed the man, "no! not a <hi>Poolo!</hi>"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="224" facs="unknown:032735_0514_0FF4994A078A9678"/>
"Are you <hi>ſure</hi> of that? cried Vivaldi, ſhrewdly.</p>
                     <p>"Aye, ſure enough, Signor. This fellow is not worth a ducat in the world!"</p>
                     <p>"But his maſter is friend," obſerved Vivaldi, in a very low voice, while he put ſome money into his hand.</p>
                     <p>The officer made no anſwer, but concealed the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and nothing further was ſaid.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi had given this as a bribe to procure ſome kindneſs for his ſervant, not from any conſideration of himſelf, for his own critical ſituation had ceaſed at this time to be a ſubject of anxiety with him. His mind was at preſent ſtrangely agitated between emotions the moſt oppoſite in their nature, the joy which a diſcovery of Ellena's ſafety inſpired, and the horrible ſuſpicions that Schedoni's aſſurances of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationſhip occaſioned. That his Ellena was the daughter of a murderer, that the father of Ellena ſhould be brought to an ignominious death, and that he himſelf, however unintentionally, ſhould have aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this event, were conſiderations almoſt too horrible to be ſuſtained! Vivaldi ſought refuge from them in various conjectures as to the motive, which might have induced Schedoni to aſſert a flaſhood in this inſtance; but that of revenge alone appeared plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and even this ſurmiſe was weakened, when he conſidered that the confeſſor had aſſured him of Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's ſafety, an aſſurance which, as Vivaldi did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the ſelfiſh policy connected with it, he believed Schedoni would not have given, had his general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent towards him been malicious. But it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that this very information, on which all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort repoſed might be falſe, and had been given only for the purpoſe of inflicting the anguiſh a diſcovery of the truth muſt load to! With an anxiety ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe, as almoſt to overcome his faculty of judging, he examined every minute probability relative to this
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:032735_0515_0FF498ECD91A21D8"/>
point, and concluded with beleiving that Schedoni, had in this laſt inſtance, at leaſt, ſpoken honeſtly.</p>
                     <p>Whether he had done ſo in his firſt aſſertion was a queſtion, which had raiſed in Vivald's mind a tempeſt of conjecture and of horror; for, while the ſubject of it was too aſtoniſhing to be fully believed, it was, alſo, too dreadful, not to be apprehended even as a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>

                     <p>WHILE theſe events were paſſing in the priſons of the Inquiſition at Rome, Ellena, in the ſanctuary of <hi>Our Lady of Pity,</hi> remained ignorant of Schedoni's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and of Vivaldi's ſituation. She underſtood that the Confeſſor was preparing to acknowledge her for his daughter, and believed that ſhe comprehended alſo the motive for his abſence; but, though he had forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den her to expect a viſit from him till his arrangement ſhould be completed, he had promiſed to write in the mean time, and inform her of all the preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Vivaldi; his unexpected ſilence had excited, therefore apprehenſions as various, though not ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as thoſe Vivaldi had ſuffered for her; nor did the ſilence of Vivaldi himſelf appear leſs extraordinary.</p>
                     <p>"His confinement muſt be ſevere indeed," ſaid the afflicted Ellena, "ſince he cannot relieve my anxiety by a ſingle line of intelligence. Or, perhaps, harraſſed by unceaſing oppoſition, he has ſubmitted to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his family, and has conſented to forget me. Ah! why did I leave the opportunity for that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to his family; why did I not enforce it myſelf!</p>
                     <p>Yet, while ſhe uttered this ſelf-reproach, the tears ſhe ſhed contradicted the pride which had ſuggeſted it; and a conviction lurking in her heart that Vivaldi could not ſo reſign her, ſoon diſſipated thoſe tears. But other conjectures recalled them; it was poſſible that he was ill—that he was dead!</p>
                     <p>

In ſuch vague and gloomy ſurmiſe, her days paſſed away; employment could no longer withdraw her from herſelf, nor muſic, even for a moment, charm away the ſenſe of ſorrow; yet ſhe regularly partook of the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous occupations of the nuns; and was ſo far from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting herſelf to indulge in any uſeleſs expreſſion of anxiety, that ſhe had never once diſcloſed the ſacred ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it; ſo that, though ſhe could not aſſume an air of cheerfulneſs, ſhe never appeared otherwiſe than tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil. Her moſt ſoothing, yet perhaps moſt melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hour, was when about ſun-ſet ſhe could wit draw unnoticed, to the terrace among the rocks, that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked the convent, and formed a part of its domain. There, alone and relieved from all ceremonial reſtraints of the ſociety, her very thoughts ſeemed more at liberty As, from beneath the light foliage of the accacias, or the more majeſtic ſhade of the plane-trees that waved their branches over the many coloured cliffs of this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, Ellena looked down upon the magnificent ſcenery of the bay, it brought back to memory, in ſad, yet plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing detail, the many happy days ſhe had paſſed on thoſe blue waters, or on the ſhores, in the ſociety of Vivaldi and her departed relative Bianchi; and every point of the proſpect marked by ſuch remembrance, which the veiling diſtance ſtole, was reſcued by imagination, and pictured by affection in tints more animated than thoſe of brighteſt nature.</p>
                     <p>One evening Ellena had lingered on the terrace la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than uſual. She had watched the rays retiring from the higheſt points of the horizon, and the fading imagery of the lower ſcene, till, the ſun having ſunk into the waves, all colouring was withdrawn, except an empur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling and repoſing hue, which overſpread the waters and the heavens, and blended in ſoft confuſion every feature of the landſcape. The roofs and ſlender ſpires of the Santa del Pieta, with a ſingle tower of the church riſing loftily over every other part of the buildings that
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:032735_0518_0FF499560B0015F8"/>
compoſed the convent, were fading faſt from the eye; but the ſolemn tint that inveſted them accorded ſo well with their ſtyle, that Ellena was unwilling to relinquiſh this intereſting object. Suddenly ſhe perceived through the dubious light an unuſual number of moving figures in the court of the great cloiſter, and liſtening, ſhe fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied ſhe could diſtinguiſh the murmuring of many voices. The white drapery of the nuns rendered them conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous as they moved, but it was impoſſible to aſcertain who were the individuals engaged in this buſtle. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the aſſemblage diſperſed; and Ellena, curious to underſtand the occaſion, of what ſhe had obſerved, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to deſcend to the convent.</p>
                     <p>She had left the terrace, and was about to enter a long avenue of cheſnuts that extended to a part of the convent, communicating immediately with the great court, when ſhe heard approaching ſteps, and, on turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the walk, perceived ſeveral perſons advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the ſhady diſtance. Among the voices, as they drew nearer, ſhe diſtinguiſhed one whoſe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting tone engaged all her attention, and began alſo to awaken memory. She liſtened, wondered, doubted, hoped and feared!—It ſpoke again! Ellena though ſhe could not be deceived in thoſe tender accents, ſo full of intelligence, ſo expreſſive of ſenſibility and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement. She proceeded with quicker ſteps, yet fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered as ſhe drew near the group, and pauſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern whether among them was any figure that might accord with the voice and juſtify her hopes.</p>
                     <p>The voice ſpoke again; it pronounced her name; pronounced it with the tremblings of tenderneſs and impatience, and Ellena ſcarcely dared to truſt her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, when ſhe beheld Olivia, the nun on San Stefano, in the cloiſters of the Della Pieta!</p>
                     <p>Ellena co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="229" facs="unknown:032735_0519_0FF498F0CC88ADE0"/>
careſſes of her young friend, and, while ſhe promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to explain the circumſtance that had led to her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent appearance here, ſhe, in her turn, made numerous enquiries relative to Ellena's adventures after ſhe had quitted San Stefano. They were now, however, ſurrounded by too many auditors to allow of unreſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed converſation; Ellena, therefore, led the nun to her apartment, and Olivia then explained her reaſons for having left the convent of San Stefano, which were indeed ſufficient to juſtify, even with the moſt rigid devotee, her conduct as to the change. This unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate recluſe, it appeared, perſecuted by the ſuſpicions of the abbeſs, who underſtood that ſhe had aſſiſted in the liberation of Ellena, had petitioned the biſhop of her dioceſe for leave to remove to the Santa della Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta. The abbeſs had not proof, to proceed formally againſt her, as an accomplice in the eſcape of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for though Jeronimo could have ſupplied the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite evidence, he was too deeply implicated in this adventure to do ſo, without betraying his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. From his having withheld ſuch proof, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, however, that accident, rather than deſign, had occaſioned his failure on the evening of Ellena's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the monaſtery. But, though the abbeſs had not teſtimony enough for legal puniſhment, ſhe was acquainted with circumſtances ſufficient to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy ſuſpicions, and had both the inclination and the power to render Olivia very miſerable.</p>
                     <p>In her choice of the Santa della Pieta, the nun was influenced by many conſiderations ſome of which were the conſequence of converſations ſhe had held with Ellena reſpecting the ſtate of that ſociety. Her deſign ſhe had been unable to diſcloſe to her freind, leſt by a diſcovery of ſuch correſpondence, the abbeſs of San Stefano ſhould obtain grounds on which to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt her. Even in her appeal to the biſhop the utmoſt caution and ſecrecy had been neceſſary, till
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:032735_0520_0FF4995793EB9048"/>
the order for her removal, procured not without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable delay and difficulty, arrived, and when it came, the jealous anger of the ſuperior rendered an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate departure neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>Olivia, during many years, had been unhappy in her local circumſtances, but it is probable ſhe would have concluded her days within the walls of San Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fano, had not the aggravated oppreſſion of the abbeſs arouſed her courage and activity, and diſſipated the deſpondency, with which ſevere misfortune had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured her views.</p>
                     <p>Ellena was particular in her inquiries whether any perſon of the monaſtery had ſuffered for the aſſiſtance they had given her; but learned, that not one, except Olivia, had been ſuſpected of befriending her; and then underſtood, that the venerable friar, who had dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to unfaſten the gate which reſtored her with Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di to liberty, had not been involved by his kindneſs.</p>
                     <p>"It is an embarraſſing and rather an unſual cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance," concluded Olivia, "to change one's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; but you perceive the ſtrong reaſons which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined me upon a removal. I was, however, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the more impatient of ſevere treatment, ſince you, my ſiſter, had deſcribed to me the ſociety of <hi>Our Lady of Pity,</hi> and ſince I believed it poſſible that you might form a part of it. When, on my arrival here, I learned that my wiſhes had not deceived me on this point, I was impatient to ſee you once more, and as ſoon as the ceremonies attending an introduction to the ſuperior were over, I requeſted to be conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you, and was in ſearch of you when we met in the avenue. It is unneceſſary for me to inſiſt upon the ſatisfaction, which this meeting gives me; but, you may not, perhaps, underſtand how much the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of our lady abbeſs, and of the ſiſterhood in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as far as a firſt interview will allow me to judge of them, have re-animated, me. The gloom, which
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:032735_0521_0FF498FA487C4D60"/>
has long hung over my proſpects, ſeems now to open, and a diſtant gleam promiſes to light up the evening of my ſtormy day."</p>
                     <p>Olivia pauſed and appeared to recollect herſelf; this was the firſt time ſhe had made ſo direct a reference to own her misfortunes: and, while Ellena ſilently remarked it, and obſerved the dejection, which was already ſtealing upon the expreſſive countenance of the nun, ſhe wiſhed, yet feared to lead her back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſubject of them.</p>
                     <p>Endeavouring to diſmiſs ſome painful remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and aſſuming a ſmile of languid gaiety, Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via ſaid, "Now that I have related the hiſtory of my removal, and ſufficiently indulged my egotiſm, will you, let me hear what adventures have befallen you, my young friend, ſince the melancholy adieu you gave me in the gardens of San Stefano."</p>
                     <p>This was a taſk, to which Ellena's ſpirits, though revived by the preſence of Olivia, were ſtill unequal, Over the ſcenes of her paſt diſtreſs. Time had not yet drawn his ſhadowing veil; the colours were all too freſh and gariſh for the meek dejection of her eye, and the ſubject was too intimately connected with that of her preſent anxiety, to be reviewed without very painful feelings. She therefore requeſted Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via to ſpare her from a detail of particulars, which ſhe could not recollect but with extreme reluctance; and, ſcrupulouſly obſerving the injunction of Schedoni, ſhe merely mentioned her ſeparation from Vivaldi upon the banks of the Celano, and that a variety of diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing circumſtances had intervened before ſhe could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the ſanctuary of the della Pieta.</p>
                     <p>Olivia underſtood too well the kind of feelings, from which Ellena was deſirous of eſcaping, willingly to ſubject her to renewal of them and felt too much generous compaſſion for her ſufferings not to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſoothe the ſenſe of them by an exertion of
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:032735_0522_0FF499591A1206C8"/>
thoſe delicate and nameleſs arts, which, while they mock detection, faſcinate, the weary ſpirits as by a charm of magic!</p>
                     <p>The friends continued in converſation, till a chime from a chapel of the convent ſummoned them to the laſt veſpers; and when the ſervice had concluded, they ſeparated for the night</p>
                     <p>With the ſociety of the Santa della Pieta, Olivia had this found an aſylum ſuch as till lately ſhe had never dared to hope for; but though ſhe frequently expreſſed her ſenſe of this bleſſing, it was ſeldom without tears; and Ellena obſerved, with ſome ſurpriſe and more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, within a few days after her arrival, a cloud of melancholy ſpreading again over her mind.</p>
                     <p>But a nearer intereſt ſoon withdrew Ellena's atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Olivia to fix it upon Vivaldi; and, when ſhe ſaw her infirm old ſervant, Beatrice, enter a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the convent, ſhe anticipated that the knowledge of ſome extraordinary, and probably unhappy event, had brought her. She knew too well the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of Schedoni to believe that Beatrice came commiſſioned from him: and as the uncertain ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Vivaldi was ſo conſtantly the ſubject of her anxiety, ſhe immediately concluded that her ſervant came to announce ſome evil relative to him.—His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, perhaps his actual confinement in the Inquiſition, which lately ſhe had ſometimes been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to think might not have been a mere menace to Vivaldi, though it had proved to be no more to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;—or poſſibly ſhe came to tell of his death—his death in thoſe priſons! This laſt was a poſſibility that almoſt incapacitated her for inquiring what was the errand of Beatrice.</p>
                     <p>The old ſervant, trembling and wan, either from the fatigue of her walk, or from a conſciouſneſs of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtrous intelligence, ſeated herſelf without ſpeaking, and ſome moments elapſed before ſhe could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed

with to give an anſwer the repeated inquiries of Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"O Signora!" ſaid ſhe, at length, "you do not know what it is to walk up hill ſuch a long way, at my age! Well! heaven protect you, I hope you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will!"</p>
                     <p>"I perceive you bring ill news," ſaid Ellena; "I am prepared for it, and you need not fear to tell me all you know."</p>
                     <p>"Holy San Marco!" exclaimed Beatrice, "if death be ill news, you have gueſſed right, Signora, for I do bring news of that, it is certain. How came you, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to know my errand? They have been before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with me, I ſee, though I have not walked ſo faſt up hill this many a day, as I have now to tell you what has happened."</p>
                     <p>She ſtopped on obſerving the changing countenance of Ellena, who tremulouſly called upon her to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain what had happened—who was dead; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her to relate the particulars as ſpeedily as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                     <p>"You ſaid you was prepared, Signora," ſaid Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice, "but your looks tell another tale."—</p>
                     <p>"What is the event you would diſcloſe?" ſaid El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena, almoſt breathleſs. "When did it happen?—be brief."</p>
                     <p>"I cannot tell exactly when it happened, Signora, but it was an own ſervant of the Marcheſe's that I had it from.</p>
                     <p>"The Marcheſe's?" interrupted Ellena in a faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering voice.</p>
                     <p>"Aye, Lady; you will ſay that is pretty good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority."</p>
                     <p>"Death! and in the Marcheſe's family!" exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Signora, I had it from his own ſervant. He was paſſing by the garden-gate juſt as I happened to
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:032735_0524_0FF4995A9E6E96A0"/>
be ſpeaking to the maccaroni-man.—But you are ill, Lady!—</p>
                     <p>"I am very well, if you will but proceed," replied Ellena, faintly, while her eyes were fixed upon Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice, as if they only had power to enforce her mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>"Well, dame," he ſays to me, "I have not ſeen you of along time." "No," ſays I, "that is a great grievance truly! for old women, now-a-days, are not much thought of; out of ſight, out of mind with them, now a-days!"</p>
                     <p>"I beſeech you to the purpoſe," interrupted Ellena. "Whoſe death did he announce?" She had not cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to pronounce Vivaldi's name.</p>
                     <p>"You ſhall hear, Signora. I ſaw he looked in a ſort of buſtle, ſo I aſked him how all did at the Palaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo; ſo he anſwers, "Bad enough, Signora Beatrice, have not you heard?" "Heard," ſays I; "what ſhould I have heard?" "Why," ſays he, "of what has juſt happened in our family."</p>
                     <p>"O heavens!" exclaimed Ellena, "he is dead! Vivaldi is dead!"</p>
                     <p>"You ſhall hear, Signora," continued Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice."</p>
                     <p>"Be brief!" ſaid Ellena, "anſwer me ſimply yes or no,"</p>
                     <p>"I cannot, till I come to the right place, Signora; if you will but have a little patience, you ſhall hear all. But if you fluſter me ſo, you will put me quite out."</p>
                     <p>"Grant me patience!" ſaid Ellena, endeavouring to calm her ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>"With that, Signora, I aſked him to walk in and reſt himſelf, and tell me all about it. He anſwered, he was in a great hurry, and could not ſtay a moment, and a great deal of that ſort; but I, knowing that whatever happened in that family, Signora, was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:032735_0525_0FF498FD54461040"/>
to you, would not let him go off ſo eaſily; and ſo, when I aſked him to refreſh himſelf with a glaſs of lemon-ice, he forgot all his buſineſs in a minute, and we had a long chat."</p>
                     <p>And Beatrice might now have continued her cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocution, perhaps, as long as ſhe had pleaſed, for Ellena had loſt all power to urge inquiry, and was ſcarcely ſenſible of what was ſaid. She neither ſpoke, nor ſhed a tear; the one image that poſſſeed her fancy, the image of Vivaldi dead, ſeemed to held all her faculties, as by a ſpell.</p>
                     <p>"So, when I aſked him," added Beatrice, "again what had happened, he was ready enough to tell all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. "It is near a month ago," ſaid he, "ſince ſhe was firſt taken; the Marcheſa had been"—</p>
                     <p>"The Marcheſa!" repeated Ellena, with whom that one word had diſſolved the ſpell of terror—"the Marcheſa!"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Signora, to be ſure. Who elſe did I ſay it was!"</p>
                     <p>"Go on, Beatrice; the Marcheſa?"—</p>
                     <p>"What makes you look ſo glad all of a ſudden, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora? I thought juſt now you were very ſorry about it. What! I warrant you was thinking about my young lord, Vivaldi."</p>
                     <p>"Proceed," ſaid Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"Well added Beatrice, "It was about a month ago that the Marcheſa was firſt taken," continued the var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. "She had ſeemed poorly a long time, but it was from a <hi>converſazione</hi> at the di Voglio palazzo, that ſhe came home ſo ill. It is ſuppoſed ſhe had been long in a bad ſtate of health, but nobody thought her ſo near her end, till the doctors were called together; and then matters looked very bad indeed. They found out that ſhe had been dying, or as good, for many years, though nobody elſe had ſuſpected it, and the Marcheſa's own phyſician was blamed for not finding it out before. But he added the rougue, "He had a regard for my

lady. He was very obſtinate too, for he kept ſaying almoſt to the laſt, there was no danger, when every body elſe ſaw how it was going. The other doctors ſoon made their words good, and my lady died."</p>
                     <p>"And her ſon',—ſaid Ellena, "was he with the Marcheſa when ſhe expired?"</p>
                     <p>"What, Signor Vivaldi, lady? No, the Signor was not there."</p>
                     <p>"That is very extraordinary!" obſerved Ellena, with emotion' "Did the ſervant mention him?"</p>
                     <p>Yes, Signora; he ſaid what a ſad thing it was that he ſhould be out of the way at that time, and nobody know where?"</p>
                     <p>"Are his family, then, ignorant where he is?" aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Ellena with encreaſed emotion.</p>
                     <p>"To be ſure they are, lady, and have been for theſe many weeks. They have heard nothing at all of the Signor, or one Paulo Mendrico, his ſervant, though the Marcheſa's people have been riding poſt after them from one end of the kingdom to the other all the time!"</p>
                     <p>Shocked with the conviction of a circumſtance, which, till lately ſhe ſcarcely believed was poſſible, the impriſonment of Vivaldi in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"The Marcheſa you are ſure then was ignorant where he was?" ſaid Ellena, with new aſtoniſhment and perplexity as to the perſon who, after betraying him into the Inquiſition, could yet have ſuffered her, though arreſted at the ſame time to eſcape.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Signora, for ſhe wanted ſadly to ſee him. And when ſhe was dying, ſhe ſent for her Confeſſor, one father Schedoni, I think they call him and"—</p>
                     <p>"What of him?" ſaid Ellena incautiouſly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="237" facs="unknown:032735_0527_0FF498FED90011F8"/>
"Nothing, Signora, for he could not he found."</p>
                     <p>"Not to be found!" repeated Ellena.</p>
                     <p>"No, Signora, not juſt then; he was Confeſſor, I warrant, to other people beſide the Marcheſa, and I dare ſay they had ſins enough to confeſs, ſo he could not get away in a hurry."</p>
                     <p>Ellena recollected herſelf ſufficiently to aſk no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Schedoni; and when ſhe conſidered the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable cauſe of Vivaldi's arreſt, ſhe was again conſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a belief that he had not fallen into the power of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eal officials, ſince the comrades of the men who had arreſted him, had proved themſelves otherwiſe; and ſhe thought it highly probable, that while undiſcovered by his family, he had been, and was ſtill engaged in ſearching for the place of her confinement.</p>
                     <p>"But I was ſaying," proceeded Beatrice, "what a buſtle there was when my lady, the Marcheſa was dying. As this father Schedoni was not to be found, another Confeſſor was ſent for, and ſhut up with her for a long while indeed! And then my Lord Marcheſe was called in, and there ſeemed to be a deal going forward, for my Lord was heard every now and then by the attendants in the anti-chamber, talking loud, and ſometimes my Lady Marcheſa's voice was heard too, though ſhe was ſo ill! At laſt all was ſilent, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ter ſome time my Lord came out of the room, and he ſeemed very much fluſtered they ſay, that he is, very angry and yet very ſorrowful. But the Confeſſor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with my Lady for a long while after; and, when he departed, my Lady appeared more unhappy than ever. She lived all that night and part of the next day, and ſomething ſeemed to lie very heavy at her heart, for ſhe ſometimes wept, but oftener groaned, and would look ſo that, it was piteous to ſee her. She frequently aſked for the Marcheſe, and when he came, the attendants were ſent away, and they held long conferences by themſelves. The Confeſſor, alſo was
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:032735_0528_0FF499663A4AB6D8"/>
ſent for again, juſt at the laſt, and they were all ſhut up together. After this, my Lady appeared more eaſy in her mind, and not long after ſhe died."</p>
                     <p>Ellena, who had attended cloſely to this little narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, was prevented, for the preſent from aſking the few queſtions which it had ſuggeſted by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of Olivia, who, on perceiving a ſtranger, was retiring, but Ellena, not conſidering theſe inquiries as important, prevailed with the nun to take a chair at the embroidery frame ſhe had lately quitted.</p>
                     <p>After converſing for a few moments with Olivia, ſhe returned to a conſideration of her own intereſts. The abſence of Schedoni ſtill appeared to her as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than accidental; and, and though ſhe could not urge any inquiry with Beatrice, concerning the monk of the Spirito Santo, ſhe ventured to aſk whether ſhe had lately ſeen the ſtranger, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored her to Altieri, for Beatrice knew him only in the character of Ellena's deliver.</p>
                     <p>"No, Signora," replied Beatrice, rather ſharply, "I have never ſeen his face ſince he attended you to the villa, though for that matter, I did not ſee much of it there; and then how he contrived to let himſelf out of the houſe that night without my ſeeing him, I cannot divine, though I have thought of it often enough ſince. I am ſure he need not to have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to have ſhewn his face to me, for I ſhould on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have bleſſed him for bringing you ſafe home again."</p>
                     <p>Ellena was ſomewhat ſurprized to find that Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice had noticed a circumſtance apparently ſo trivial, and replied, that ſhe had herſelf opened the door for her protector.</p>
                     <p>While Beatrice ſpoke, Olivia raiſing her eyes from the embroidery, had fixed them upon the old ſervant, who reſpectfully withdrew her's; but, when the nun was again engaged on her work, ſhe reſumed her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. Ellena fancied ſhe perceived ſomething
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:032735_0529_0FF49908E4CFF728"/>
extraordinary in this mutual examination, although the curioſity of ſtrangers towards each other might have accounted for it,</p>
                     <p>Beatrice then received directions from Ellena as to, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>me drawings, which ſhe wiſhed to have ſent to the convent, and when the ſervant ſpoke in reply, Olivia again raiſed eyes, and fixed them on her face with intenſe curioſity.</p>
                     <p>"I certainly ought to know that voice," ſaid the nun, with great emotion, "thought I dare not judge from your features. Is it,—can it be poſſible?—is it Beatrice Olca, to whom I ſpeak? So many years have paſſed."—Beatrice, with equal ſurpriſe, anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, "It is, Signora; you are right in my name. But, lady, who are you that know me?"</p>
                     <p>While ſhe earneſtly regarded Olivia, there was an expreſſion of diſmay in her look, which increaſed El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena's perplexity. The nun's complexion varied every inſtant, and her words failed when ſhe attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpeak. Beatrice meanwhile, exclaimed "My eyes deceive me! yet there is a ſtrange likeneſs. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta della Pieta! how it has fluttered me! my heart beats ſtill—you are ſo like her, lady, yet you are very different too."</p>
                     <p>Olivia, whoſe regards were now entirely fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Ellena, ſaid in a voice that was ſcarcely articulate, while her whole frame ſeemed ſinking beneath ſome irreſiſtible feeling, "Tell me, Beatrice, I conjure you, quickly ſay, who is this?"—She pointed to Ellena, and the ſentence died on her lips.</p>
                     <p>Beatrice, wholly occupied by intereſts of her own, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ave no reply, but exclaimed, "It is, in truth, the Lady Olivia! It is herſelf! In the name of all that is ſacred, how came you here? O! how glad you muſt have been to find one another out!" She looked, ſtill gaſping with aſtoniſhment at Olivia, while Ellena unheard, repeatedly enquired the meaning of her words,
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:032735_0530_0FF49967C3B6A348"/>
and in the next moment found herſelf preſſed to the boſom of the nun, who ſeemed better to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood them, and who weeping, trembling, and almoſt fainting, held her there in ſilence.</p>
                     <p>Ellena, after ſome moments had thus paſſed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted an explanation of what ſhe witneſſed, and Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice, at the ſame time, demanded the cauſe of all this emotion. "For can it be that you did not know one another?" ſhe added.</p>
                     <p>"What new diſcovery is this?" ſaid Ellena, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the nun. "It is but lately that I have found my father! O tell me by what tender name I am to call you?"</p>
                     <p>"Your father! exclaimed Olivia.</p>
                     <p>"Your father, lady!" echoed Beatrice.</p>
                     <p>Ellena, betrayed by ſtrong emotion into this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature mention of Schedoni, was embarraſſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"No, my child!" ſaid Olivia, ſoftening from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement into tones of ineffable ſorrow, while ſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain preſſed Ellena to her heart—"No! thy father is in the grave!"</p>
                     <p>Ellena no longer returned her careſſes; ſurprize and doubt ſuſpended every tender emotion; ſhe gazed upon Olivia with an intenſeneſs that partook of wildneſs. At length, ſhe ſaid, ſlowly—"It is my mother, then, whom I ſee! When will theſe diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries end!"</p>
                     <p>"It is your mother!" replied Olivia, ſolemnly: a mother's bleſſing reſts with you!"</p>
                     <p>The nun endeavoured to ſoothe the agitated ſpirits of Ellena, though ſhe was herſelf nearly overwhelmed by the various and acute feelings this diſcloſure occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned. For a conſiderable time they were unable to ſpeak but in ſhort ſentences of affectionate exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but joy was evidently a more predominant feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the parent than with the child. When, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:032735_0531_0FF4990A6B8C50C0"/>
Ellena could weep, ſhe became more tranquil, and, by degrees, was ſenſible of a degree of happineſs, ſuch as ſhe had, perhaps, never experienced.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile Beatrice ſeemed loſt in amazement mingled with fear. She expreſſed no pleaſure, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the joy ſhe witneſſed, but was uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grave and obſervant.</p>
                     <p>Olivia, when ſhe recovered ſome degree of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, inquired for her ſiſter Bianchi. The ſilence and ſudden dejection of Ellena indicated the truth. On this mention of her late miſtreſs, Beatrice recovered the uſe of ſpeech.</p>
                     <p>"Alas! lady," ſaid the old ſervant, "ſhe is now where I believed you were! and I ſhould as ſoon have expected to ſee my dear miſtreſs here as yourſelf.</p>
                     <p>Olivia, though affected by this intelligence, did not feel it with the acuteneſs ſhe would have done proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at any other moment. After ſhe had indulged her tears, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he added, that from the unuſual ſilence of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anchi, ſhe had ſuſpected the truth, and particularly ſince not any anſwer had been returned to the letter ſhe had ſent to Altieri upon her arrival at the Santa del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Pieta.</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" ſaid Beatrice, "I wonder much my lady abbeſs failed to tell you the ſad news, for ſhe knew it too well!—My dear miſtreſs is buried in the church here! as for the letter, I have brought it with me for Signora Ellena to open."</p>
                     <p>"The lady abbeſs is not informed of our relation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip," replied Olivia, "and I have particular reaſons for wiſhing that at preſent ſhe ſhould remain ignorant of it. Even you my Ellena, muſt appear only as my friend, till ſome enquiries have been made which are eſſential to my peace."</p>
                     <p>Olivia required an explanation of Ellena's late ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary aſſertion reſpecting her father, but this was a requeſt made with emotions very different from
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:032735_0532_0FF4996948275378"/>
thoſe which hope or joy inſpire. Ellena believing that the ſame circumſtances which had deceived herſelf during ſo many years, as to his death, had alſo miſled Olivia, was not ſurpriſed at the incredulity her mother had ſhewn, but ſhe was conſiderably embarraſſed how to anſwer her enquiries. It was now too late to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the promiſe of ſecrecy extorted from her by Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni: the firſt moments of ſurpriſe had betrayed her; yet while ſhe trembled further to tranſgreſs his injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe perceived that a full explanation was now unavoidable. And, ſince Ellena conſidered, that as Schedoni could not have foreſeen her preſent peculiar ſituation, his command had no reference to her mother, her ſcruples on this head diſappeared. When, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Beatrice had withdrawn, Ellena repeated her aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, that he father ſtill lived; which, though it encreaſed the amazement of Olivia, did not vanquiſh her incredulity. Olivia's tears flowed faſt, while in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to this aſſurance, ſhe mentioned the year in which the Count di Bruno died, with ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances relative to his death; which however, as El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena underſtood that her mother had not witneſſed it, ſhe ſtill believed it had not happened. To confirm her late aſſertion, Ellena then related a few particulars of her ſecond interview with Schedoni, and ſome confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that he lived, offered to produce the portrait, which he had claimed as his own. Olivia, in great agitation, requeſted to ſee the minature, and Ellena left the apartment in ſearch of it.</p>

                        </gap>, which ſhe wiſhed, yet dreaded to develope; and when, at length, Ellena appeared with the mina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, ſhe took it in trembling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

gazed upon it for an inſtant, her complexion faded and ſhe fainted.</p>
                     <p>Ellena had now no doubt reſpecting the truth of Schedoni's declaration, and blamed herſelf for not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more gradually prepared her mother for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a circumſtance, which ſhe believed had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed her with joy. The uſual applications, however, ſoon reſtored Olivia, who, when ſhe was again alone with her daughter, deſired to behold once more the portrait. Ellena attributing the ſtrong emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with which ſhe ſtill regarded it, to ſurpriſe, and fear leſt ſhe wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> admitting a fallacious hope, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to comfort her by renewed aſſurances, that not only the Count di Bruno yet exiſted, but that he lived at this very time in Naples, and further, that he would probably be in her preſence within the hour. "When I quitted the room for the minature," added Ellena, "I diſpatched a perſon with a note, requeſting to ſee my father immediately, being impatient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alize the joy, which ſuch a meeting between my long loſt parents muſt occaſion."</p>
                     <p>In this inſtance, Ellena had certainly ſuffered her generous ſympathy to overcome her diſcretion, for, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hough the contents of the note to Schedoni could not poſitively have betrayed him, had he even been in Naples at this time, her ſending it to the Spirito San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, inſtead of the place which he had appointed for his letters, might have led to a premature inquiry reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf.</p>
                     <p>While Ellena had acquainted Olivia that Schedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni would probably be with them ſoon, ſhe watched eagerly for the joyful ſurpriſe ſhe expected would appear on her countenance; how ſevere th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n was her diſappointment when only terror and diſmay were expreſſed there! and, when, in the next moment, her mother uttered exclamations of diſtreſs and even of deſpair!</p>

                        <pb n="244" facs="unknown:032735_0534_0FF4997590F0B738"/>
"If he ſees me," ſaid Olivia, "I am irrecoverably loſt! O! unhappy Ellena! your precipitancy has deſtroyed me. The original of this portrait is not the Count di Bruno, my dear lord, nor, your parent, but his brother, the cruel huſband."—</p>
                     <p>Olivia, left the ſentence unfiniſhed, as if ſhe was betraying more than was at preſent diſcreet; but Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, whom aſtoniſhment had kept ſilent, now entreated that ſhe would explain her words, and the cauſe of her diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>"I know not ſaid Olivia, "by what means that portrait has been conveyed to you; but it is the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Count Ferando di Bruno, the brother of my lord, and my"—ſecond huſband ſhe ſhould have ſaid, but her lips refuſed to honor him with the title.</p>
                     <p>She pauſed and was much affected, but preſently added—</p>
                     <p>"I cannot at preſent explain the ſubject more fully, for it is to me a very diſtreſſing one. Let me rather conſider the means of avoiding an interview with di Bruno, and even of concealing, if poſſible, that I exiſt."</p>
                     <p>Olivia was however, ſoothed when ſhe underſtood that Ellena had not named her in the note, but had merely deſired to ſee the Confeſſor upon a very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occaſion.</p>
                     <p>While they were conſulting upon the excuſe it would be neceſſary to form for this imprudent ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, the meſſenger returned with the note unopened, and with information that father Schedoni was abroad on a pilgrimage, which was the explanation the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Spirito Santo choſe to give of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; judging it prudent, for the honor of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, to conceal his real ſituation.</p>
                     <p>Olivia, thus releaſed from her fears, conſented to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain ſome points of the ſubject ſo intereſting to El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena;
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:032735_0535_0FF4990D7B6882E8"/>
but is was not till ſeveral days after this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, that ſhe could ſufficiently command her ſpirits to relate the whole of her narrative. The firſt part of it agreed perfectly with the account delivered in the confeſſion to the penitentiary Anſaldo; that which follows was known only to herſelf, her ſiſter Bianchi, a phyſician, and one faithful ſervant, who had been conſiderably entruſted with the conduct of the plan.</p>
                     <p>It may be recollected that Schedoni left his houſe immediately after the act, which was deſigned to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the Counteſs his wife, and that ſhe was carried ſenſeleſs to her chamber. The wound as appears was not mortal. But the atrocity of the intent determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to ſeize the opportunity thus offered by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Schedoni, and her own peculiar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to releaſe herſelf from his tyranny without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving recourſe to a court of juſtice, which would have covered with infamy the brother of her firſt huſband. She withdrew, therefore, from his houſe for ever, and with the aſſiſtance of the three perſons before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, retired to a remote part of Italy, and ſought refuge in the convent of San Stefano, while at home the report of her death was confirmed by a public funeral. Bianchi remained for ſome time after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of Olivia, in her own reſidence near the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la di Bruno, having taken under her immediate care the daughter of the Counteſs and of the firſt Count di Bruno, as well as an infant daughter of the ſecond.</p>
                     <p>After ſome time had clapſed, Bianchi withdrew with her young charge, but not to the neighbourhood of San Stefano. The indulgence of a mother's tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was denied to Olivia, for Bianchi could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide near the convent without ſubjecting her to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of diſcovery, ſince Schedoni, though he now believed the report of her death, might be led to doubt it by the conduct of Bianchi, whoſe ſteps would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be obſerved by him. She choſe a refider<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="246" facs="unknown:032735_0536_0FF49977198EA5F8"/>
therefore, at a diſtance from Olivia, though not yet at Altieri. At this period, Ellena was not two years old; the daughter of Schedoni was ſcarcely as many months, as ſhe died before the year concluded. It was this his child for whom the Confeſſor, who had too well concealed himſelf to permit Bianchi to acquaint him with her death, had miſtaken Ellena, and to which miſtake his own portrait, affirmed by Ellena to be that of her father, had contributed. This minature ſhe had ſound in the cabinet of Bianchi after her aunt's deceaſe, and, obſerving it inſcribed with the title of Count di Bruno, ſhe had worn it with a filial fondneſs ever ſince that period.</p>
                     <p>Bianchi, when ſhe had acquainted Ellena with the ſecret of her birth, was withheld both by prudence and humanity, from intruſting her with a knowledge that her mother lived; but this, no doubt, was the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſhe appeared ſo anxious to diſcloſe on her death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, when the ſuddenneſs of her diſorder had deprived her of the power. The abruptneſs of that event had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> contributed to keep the mother and daughter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to each other, even when they afterwards acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally met, to which concealment the name of Roſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, given to Ellena from her infancy by Bianchi, for the purpoſe of protecting her from diſcovery by her uncle, had aſſiſted. Beatrice, who was not the domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic intruſted with the eſcape of Olivia, had believed the report of her death, and thus, though ſhe knew Ellena to be the daughter of the Counteſs di Bruno, ſhe could never have been a means of diſcovering them to each other, had it not happened that Olivia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized this ancient ſervant of Bianchi, while Ellena was preſent.</p>
                     <p>When Bianchi came to reſide in the neighbourhood of Naples, ſhe was unſuſpicious that Schedoni, who has never been heard of ſince the night of the aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, inhabited there; and ſhe ſo ſeldom left her
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:032735_0537_0FF499199B088458"/>
houſe, that it is not ſurpriſing ſhe ſhould never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to meet him, at leaſt conſciouſly; for her veil, and the monk's cowl, might eaſily have concealed them from each other if they had met.</p>
                     <p>It appears to have been the intention of Bianchi to diſcloſe to Vivaldi the family of Ellena, before their nuptials, were ſolemnized; ſince, on the evening of their laſt converſation, ſhe had declared, when her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits were exhauſted by the exertion ſhe had made, that much remained for her to ſay, which weakneſs obliged her to defer till another opportunity. Her unexpected death prevented any future meeting. That ſhe had not ſooner intended to make a communication, which might have removed, in a conſiderable degree, the objection of the Vivaldi to a connection with El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena, appears extraordinary till other circumſtances of her family, than that of its nobility, are conſidered. Her preſent indigence, and yet more, the guilt attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an individual of the di Bruno, it was reaſonable to ſuppoſe would operate as a full antidote of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurement of rank, however jealous of birth the Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di had proved themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Ferando di Bruno had contrived, even in the ſhort interval between the death of his brother and the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed deceaſe of his wife, again to embarraſs his affairs, and ſoon after his flight, the income arriſing from what remained of his landed property had been ſeized upon by his creditors, whether lawfully or not, he was then in a ſituation which did not permit him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and Ellena was thus left wholly dependant upon her aunt. The ſmall fortune of Bianchi had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed by the aſſiſtance ſhe afforded Olivia, for whoſe admittance into the convent of San Stefano it had been neceſſary to advance a conſiderable ſum; and her original income was afterwards reduced by the purchaſe of the villa Altieri. This expenditure, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was not an imprudent one, ſince ſhe preferred
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:032735_0538_0FF499789E5E2B80"/>
the comforts and independence of a pleaſant home; with induſtry, to the indulgence of an indolence which muſt have confined her to an inferior reſidence; and was acquainted with the means of making this induſtry profitable without being diſhonourable. She excelled in many elegant and ingenious arts, and the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her pencil and needle were privately diſpoſed of to the nuns of the Santa della Pieta. When Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na was of an age to aſſiſt her, ſhe reſigned much of the imployment and profit to her niece, whoſe genius hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unfolded itſelf, the beauty of her deſigns and the elegance of her execution, both in drawing and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery, were ſo highly valued by the purchaſers at the grace of the convent, that Bianchi committed to Ellena altogether the exerciſe of her art</p>
                     <p>Olivia meanwhile had dedicated her life to devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the monaſtery of San Stefano, a choice which was willingly made while her mind was yet ſoftened by grief for the death of her firſt lord, and wearied by the cruelty ſhe had afterwards experienced. The firſt years of her retirement were paſſed in tranquility, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when the remembrance of her child, whom ſhe did not dare to ſee at the convent, awakened a paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal pang. With Bianchi, ſhe, however, correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as regularly as opportunity would allow, and had at leaſt the conſolation of knowing, that the object moſt dear to her lived, till, within a ſhort period of Ellena's arrival at the very aſylum choſen by her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, her apprehenſions were in ſome degree excited by the unuſual ſilence of Bianchi.</p>
                     <p>When Oliva had firſt ſeen Ellena in the chapel of San Stefano, ſhe was ſtruck with a ſlight reſemblance ſhe bore to the late Count di Bruno, and had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently afterwards examined her features with a moſt painful curioſity; but, circumſtanced as ſhe was, Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via could not reaſonably ſuſpect the ſtranger to be her daughter. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, however, a ſenſe of this poſſibility
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:032735_0539_0FF4991B22AA92A0"/>
ſo far overcame her judgment, as to prompt an inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the ſirname of Ellena; but the mention of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalba had checked all further conjecture. What would have been the feelings of the nun, had ſhe been told when her generous compaſſion was aſſiſting a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to eſcape from oppreſſion, that ſhe was preſerving her own child! It may be worthy of obſervation, that the virtues of Olivia, exerted in a general cauſe, had thus led her unconſciouſly to the happineſs of ſaving her daughter; while the vices of Schedoni had as unconſciouſly urged him nearly to deſtroy his niece, and had always been preventing by the means they prompted him to employ, the ſucceſs of his conſtant aim.</p>

                     <p>THE Marcheſa di Vivaldi, of whoſe death Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice had given an imperfect account, ſtruck with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of the crime ſhe had meditated againſt Ellena, and with terror of the puniſhment due to it, had ſent, when on her death bed, for a Confeſſor, to whom ſhe unburthened her conſcience and from whom ſhe hoped to receive, in return, an alleviation of her deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. This confeſſor was a man of good ſenſe and humanity; and, when he fully underſtood the ſtory of Vivaldi and Ellena di Roſalba, he declared, that her only hope of forgiveneſs both for the crime ſhe had meditated, and the undeſerved ſufferings ſhe had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, reſted upon her willingneſs to make thoſe now happy, whom ſhe had formerly rendered miſerable. Her conſcience had already given her the ſame leſſon; and, now that ſhe was ſinking to that grave which levels all diſtinctions, and had her juſt fear of retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no longer oppoſed by her pride, ſhe became as anxious to promote the marriage of Vivaldi with Ellena, as ſhe had ever been to prevent it. She ſent, therefore, for the Marcheſe; and, having made an avowal of the arts ſhe had practiſed againſt the peace and reputation of Ellena, without, however, confeſſing the full extent of her intended crimes, ſhe made it her laſt requeſt, that he would conſent to the happineſs of his ſon.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſe, however, ſhocked as he was at this diſcovery of the duplicity and cruelty of his wife, had neither her terror of the future, or remorſe for the
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:032735_0541_0FF499D5F47CE3C0"/>
paſt, to overcome his objection to the rank of Ellena; and he reſiſted all her importunity, till anguiſh of her laſt hours overcame every conſideration but that of affording her relief; he then gave a ſolemn promiſe, in the preſence of the Confeſſor, that he would no longer oppoſe the marriage of Vivaldi and Ellena, ſhould the former perſiſt in his attachment to her. This promiſe was ſufficient for the Marcheſa, and ſhe died with ſome degree of reſignation. It did not, however, appear probable, the Marcheſe would ſoon be called upon to fulfil the engagements, into which he had ſo unwillingly entered, every inquiry after Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di having been hitherto ineffectual.</p>
                     <p>During the progreſs of this fruitleſs ſearch for his ſon, and while the Marcheſe was almoſt lamenting him as dead, the inhabitants of the Vivaldi place were, one night, arouſed from ſleep by a violent knocking at the great gate of the court. The noiſe was ſo loud and inceſſant, that, before the porter could obey the ſummons, the Marcheſa, whoſe apartment looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the court, was alarmed, and ſent an attendant from his anti-room, to inquire the occaſion of it.</p>
                     <p>Preſently a voice was heard from the firſt anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, exclaiming, "I muſt ſee my Lord Marcheſe directly; he will not be angry to be waked, when he knows all about it," and, before the Marcheſe could order that no perſon, on whatever, pretence ſhould be admitted, Paulo, haggard, ragged, and covered with dirt, was in the chamber. His <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, were altogether ſo ſtriking and and terrific, that the Marcheſe, anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome dreadful news of Vivaldi, had ſcarcely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to inquire for him. Paulo, however, rendered queſtions unneceſſary; for, without any circumloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:032735_0542_0FF49986C27B6040"/>
or preface, he immediately informed the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſe, that the Signor, his dear maſter was in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Inquiſition, at Rome, if, indeed, they had not put an end to him before that time."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, my Lord," ſaid Paulo, "I am juſt got out myſelf, for they would not let me be with the Signor ſo it was of no uſe to ſtay there any longer. Yet it was a hard matter with me to go away, and leave my dear maſter within thoſe diſmal walls; and nothing ſhould have perſuaded me to do ſo, but that I hoped, when your Lordſhip knew where the Signor was, yet might be able to get him out. But there is not minute to be loſt, my Lord, for when once a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man has got within the claws of thoſe inquiſitors, there as no knowing how ſoon they may take it in their heads to tear him in pieces. Shall I order horſes for Rome, my Lord? I am ready to ſet off again directly.</p>
                     <p>The ſuddenneſs of ſuch intelligence, concerning an only ſon, might have agitated ſtronger nerves that thoſe of the Marcheſe, and ſo much was he ſhocked be it, that he could not immediately determine how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> collected to make further inquiry into the ſituation Vivaldi he perceived the neceſſary of an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the following morning. Yet he gave orders, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration ſhould be made for his ſetting out at a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's notice; and, having liſtened to as full an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count as Paulo could give of the paſt and preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Vivaldi, he diſmiſſed him to repoſe for the remainder of the night.</p>
                     <p>Paulo, however, though much in want of reſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

find it; and the fear he had indicated, on entering the Marcheſe's apartment, proceeded from the hurry of his mind, rather than from any poſitive apprehenſion of new evil. For his liberty he was indebted to the young centinel, who had, on a former occaſion, been removed from the door of his priſon, but who, by means of the guard, to whom Vivaldi had given mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as he returned one night from the tribunal, had ſince been able to communicate with him. This man, of a nature too humane for his ſituation, was become wretched in it, and he determined to eſcape from his office before the expiration of the time, for which he had been engaged. He thought, that to be a guard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ver priſoners was nearly as miſerable as being a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner himſelf. "I ſee no difference between them," <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> he, "except that the priſoner watches on one ſide of the door, and the centinel on the other."</p>
                     <p>With the reſolution to releaſe himſelf, he conferred with Paulo, whoſe good nature and feeling heart, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſo many people of a contrary character, had won <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>is confidence and affection, and he laid his plan of eſcape ſo well, that it was on the point of ſucceeding, when Paulo's obſtinacy, in attempting an impoſſibility and nearly counteracted the whole. It went to his heart, he ſaid, to leave his maſter in priſon, while he himſelf was to march off in ſafety, and he would run <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        </gap> head. He propoſed, therefore, as Vivaldi's guards were of too ferocious a nature to be tampered with, to ſcale, a wall of the court into which a grate of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi's dungeon looked. But had this lofty wall been practicable, the grate was not; and the attempt had nearly coſt Paulo not only his liberty, but his life.</p>
                     <p>When, at length, he had made his way through the perilous avenues of the priſon, and was fairly beyond the walls, he could hardly be prevailed upon by his companion to leave them. For near an hour, he
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:032735_0544_0FF499884B848C20"/>
wandered under their ſhade, weeping and exclaiming, and calling upon his dear maſter, at the evident ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of being retaken; and probably would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there much longer, had not the dawn of morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rendered his companion deſperate. Juſt, however, as the man was forcing him away, Paulo fancied he diſtinguiſhed, by the ſtrengthening light, the roof of that particular building, in whoſe dungeon his maſter was confined, and the appearance of Vivaldi himſelf, could ſcarcely have occaſioned a more ſudden burſt of joy; ſucceeded, by one of grief, "It is the roof, it is the very roof!" exclaimed Paulo, vaulting from the ground, and clapping his hands: "it is the roof, the roof! O, my maſter, my maſter! the roof, the roof!" He continued, alternately, to exclaim, "My maſter! the roof! my maſter! the roof! till his companion began to fear he was frantic, while tears ſtreamed down his cheeks, and every look and geſture expreſſed the moſt extravagant and whimſical union of joy and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. At length the abſolute terror of diſcovery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled his companion to force him from the ſpot; when, having loſt ſight of the building which incloſed Vivaldi, he ſet off for Naples with a ſpeed that defied all interruption, and arrived there in the condition, which has been mentioned, having taken no ſleep, and ſcarcely any ſuſtenance, ſince he left the inquiſition. Yet, though in this exhauſted ſtate, the ſpirit of his affection remained unbroken and when, on the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing morning, the Marcheſe quitted Naples neither his wearineſs, nor the iminent danger, to which this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney muſt expoſe him, could prevent his attending him to Rome.</p>
                     <p>The rank of the Marcheſe, and the influence he was known to poſſeſs at the court of Naples, were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that promiſed to have weight with the Holy Office, and to procure Vivaldi a ſpeedy releaſe; but yet more than theſe, were the high connections which the
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:032735_0545_0FF499D906B4BC60"/>
Count di Maro, the friend of the Marcheſe, had in the church of Rome.</p>
                     <p>The applications, however, which were made to the Inquiſitors, were not ſo ſoon replied to as the wiſhes of the Marcheſe had expected, and he had been above a fortnight in that city, before he was even per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to viſit his ſon. In this interview, affection predominated on both ſides over all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>emembrance of the paſt. The condition of Vivaldi, his faded appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to which the wounds he had received at Celano, and from which he was ſcarcely recovered, had contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted; and his ſituation in a melancholy and terrible priſon, were circumſtances that awakened all the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of the father; his errors were forgiven, and the Marcheſe felt diſpoſed to conſent to all that might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him to happineſs, could he but be reſtored to liberty.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, when informed of his mother's death, ſhed bitter tears of ſorrow and remorſe, for having occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſo much uneaſineſs. The unreaſonableneſs of her claims was forgotten, and her faults were extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; happily, indeed, for his peace, the extent of her criminal deſigns he had never underſtood; and when he learned that her dying requeſt had been intended to promote his happineſs, the cruel conſciouſneſs of having interrupted her's, occaſioned him ſevere an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, and he was obliged to recollect her former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards Ellena at San Stefano, before he could become reconciled to himſelf.</p>

                     <p>NEAR three weeks had elapſed ſince the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſe's arrival at Rome, and not any deciſive anſwer was returned, by the Inquiſition, to his application when he and Vivaldi received, at the ſame time, a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to attend father Schedoni in his dungeon. To meet the man who had occaſioned ſo much ſuffering to his family, was extremely painful to the Marcheſe, but he was not allowed to refuſe the interview; and at the hour appointed he called at the chamber of Vivaldi; and, followed by two officials, they paſſed on together to that of Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>While they waited at the door of the priſon-room, till the numerous bars and locks were unfaſtened, the agitation, which Vivaldi had ſuffered, on receiving the ſummons, returned with redoubled force, now that he was about to behold, once more, that wretched man, who had announced himſelf to be the parent of Ellena di Roſalba. The Marcheſe ſuffered emotions of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature, and with his reluctance to ſee Schedoni, was mingled a degree of curioſity, as to the event, which had occaſioned this ſummons.</p>

<pb n="257" facs="unknown:032735_0547_0FF499DA8DE54810"/>
if death had already touched them.—Vivaldi, on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him, groaned, and averted his face; but, ſoon recovering a command of himſelf, he approached the mattreſs.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſe, ſuppreſſing every expreſſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment towards an enemy, who was reduced to this deplorable condition, inquired what he had to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate.</p>
                     <p>"Where is father Nicola?" ſaid Schedoni, to an official, without attending to the queſtion: "I do not, ſee him here. Is he gone ſo ſoon, and without having heard the purport of my ſummons? Let him be called."</p>
                     <p>The official ſpoke to a centinel, who immediately left the chamber.</p>
                     <p>"Who are theſe that ſurround me?" ſaid Schedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni. "Who is he that ſtands at the foot of the bed?" While he ſpoke, he bent his eyes on Vivaldi, who reſted in deep dejection there, and was loſt in thought, till arouſed by Schedoni's voice, he replied,</p>
                     <p>"It is I, Vincentio di Vivaldi; I obey your requiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and inquire the purpoſe of it?"</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſe repeated the demand. Schedoni ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to meditate; ſometimes he fixed his eyes upon Vivaldi, for an inſtant, and when he withdrew them, he ſeemed to ſink into deeper thoughtfulneſs. As he raiſed them once again, they aſſumed a ſingular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of wildneſs, and then ſettling, as if on vacancy, a ſudden glare ſhot from them, while he ſaid—"Who is he that glides there in the duſk?"</p>
                     <p>His eyes were directed beyond Vivaldi, who, on turning, perceived the monk, father Nicola, paſſing behind him.</p>
                     <p>"I am here," ſaid Nicola: "what do you require of me?"</p>
                     <p>"That you will bear teſtimony to the truth of what I ſhall declare," replied Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>Nicola and an Inquiſitor who had accompanied
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:032735_0548_0FF4998B55D52068"/>
him, immediately arranged themſelves on one ſide of the bed, while the Marcheſe ſtationed himſelf on the other. Vivaldi remained at its foot.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni, after a pauſe began: "That which I have to make known relates to the cabal formerly carried on by him, the father Nicola, and myſelf, againſt the peace of an innocent young woman, whom, at my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation, he has baſely traduced."</p>
                     <p>At theſe words, Nicola attempted to interrupt the Confeſſor, but Vivaldi reſtrained him.</p>
                     <p>"Ellena di Roſalba is known to you?" continue Schedoni, addreſſing the Marcheſe.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi's countenance changed at this abrupt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ellena, but he remained ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"I have heard of her," replied the Marcheſe, coldly.</p>
                     <p>"And you have heard falſely of her rejoined Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni, "Lift your eyes, my lord Marcheſe, and ſay, do you not recollect that face?" pointing to Nicola.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſe regarded the monk attentively. "It is a face not eaſily to be forgotten," he replied; "I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have ſeen it more than once."</p>
                     <p>"Where have you ſeen him, my Lord?"</p>
                     <p>"In my own palace, at Naples; and you yourſelf introduced him to me there."</p>
                     <p>"I did," replied Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>"Why, then, do you now accuſe him of falſehood," obſerved the Marcheſe, "ſince you acknowledge your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have been the inſtigator of his conduct?"</p>
                     <p>"O heavens!" ſaid Vivaldi: "this monk, then, this father Nicola, is, as I ſuſpected, the ſlanderer of Ellena di Roſalba!"</p>
                     <p>"Moſt true," rejoined Schedoni; "and it is for the purpoſe of vindicating—"</p>
                     <p>"And you acknowledge yourſelf to be the author of thoſe infamous ſlanders!" paſſionately interrupted Vivaldi:—"you, who but lately declared yourſelf to be her father!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="259" facs="unknown:032735_0549_0FF499E49309A458"/>
In the inſtant, that Vivaldi had uttered this, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſenſible of his indiſcretion, for till now he had avoided informing the Marcheſe that Ellena had been declared the daughter of Schedoni. This abrupt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure, and at ſuch a moment, he immediately perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed might be fatal to his hopes, and that the Marcheſe would not conſider the promiſe he had given to his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wife, however, ſolemn, as binding, under circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſo peculiar and unforeſeen as the preſent. The aſtoniſhment of the Marcheſe, upon this diſcovery, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily be imagined; he looked at his ſon for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of what he had heard, and then, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed deteſtation, at the Confeſſor; but Vivaldi was not in a ſtate of mind to give any explanation at this moment, and he requeſted his father to ſuſpend even his conjectures till he could converſe with him alone.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſe deſiſted, for the preſent, from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inquiry, but it was obvious that his opinion and his reſolution, reſpecting the marriage of Vivaldi, was already formed.</p>
                     <p>"You, then, are the author of thoſe ſlanders!" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Hear me!" cried Schedoni, in a voice which the ſtrength of his ſpirit, contending with the feebleneſs of his condition, rendered hollow and terrible—"Hear me!"</p>
                     <p>He ſtopped, unable to recover immediately from the effect of the exertion he had made.—At length, he reſumed:</p>
                     <p>"I have declared, and I continue to declare, that Ellena di Roſalba, as ſhe has been named for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I conjecture, of concealing her from an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy father, as my daughter!"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi groaned in the exceſs of his deſpair, but made no further attempt to interrupt Schedoni, The Marcheſe was not equally paſſive.—"And was it to liſten to a vindication of your daughter," ſaid he,
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:032735_0550_0FF499965FC76040"/>
"that I have been ſummoned hither? But let this Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora Roſalba, be who ſhe may, of what inport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance can it be to me whether ſhe is innocent or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe!"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, with the utmoſt difficulty, forbore to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the feelings, which this ſentence excited. It appeared to recall all the ſpirit of Schedoni. "She is the daughter of a noble houſe, "ſaid the Confeſſor, haughtily, while he half raiſed himſelf from his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. "In me you behold the laſt of the Count's di Bruno."</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſe ſmiled contemptuouſly."</p>
                     <p>Schedoni proceeded. "I call upon you, Nicola di Zampari, who have declared yourſelf, on a late occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo ſtrenuous for juſtice, I call upon you now to do juſtice in this inſtance, and to acknowledge, before theſe witneſſes, that Ellena Roſalba is innocent of every circumſtance of miſconduct, which you have formerly related to the Marcheſe di Vivaldi!"</p>
                     <p>"Villain! do you heſitate," ſaid Vivaldi to Nicola, "to retract the cruel ſlanders which you have thrown upon her name, and which have been the means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying her peace, perhaps for ever? Do you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt—"</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſe interrupted his ſon:—</p>
                     <p>"Let me put an end to the difficulty, by conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the interview; I perceive that my preſence has been required for a purpoſe that does not concern me."</p>
                     <p>Before the Confeſſor could reply, the Marcheſe had turned from him to quit the chamber; but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence of Vivaldi's diſtreſs prevailed with him to pauſe, and thus allowed him to underſtand from Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni, that the juſtification of the innocent Ellena, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hough it had been mentioned firſt, as being the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject neareſt to his heart, was not the only one that had urged him to require this meeting.</p>
                     <p>"If you conſent," added Schedoni, "to liſten to the
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:032735_0551_0FF499E617C914B0"/>
vindication of my child, you ſhall afterwads perceive, Signor, that I, fallen though I am, have ſtill been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of counteracting, as far as remains for me, the evil I, have occaſioned. You ſhall acknowledge, that what I then made known is of the utmoſt conſequence to the repoſe the of Marcheſe di Vivaldi, high in influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and haughty in proſperity as he now appears."</p>
                     <p>The latter part of this aſſurance threatened to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the effect of the firſt; the pride of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſe ſwelled high; he took ſome ſteps towards the door, but then ſtopped, and conjecturing that the ſubject, to which Schedoni alluded, concerned the liberation of his ſon, he conſented to attend to what Nicola ſhould diſcloſe.</p>
                     <p>This monk, meanwhile, had been balancing the neceſſity for acknowledging himſelf a ſlanderer againſt the poſſibility of avoiding it; and it was the reſolute manner of Vivaldi, who appeared to have no doubt as to his guilt in this inſtance, that made him apprehend the conſequence of perſiſting in falſhood, not either remorſe of conſcience, or the appeal of Schedoni. He acknowledged then, after conſiderable circumlocution, in which he contrived to defend himſelf, by throwing all the odium of the original deſign upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, that he had been prevailed upon by his arts to impoſe on the credulity of the Marcheſe, reſpecting the conduct of Ellena di Roſalba. This avowal was made upon oath, and Schedoni, by the queſtions he put to him, was careful it ſhould be ſo full and circumſtantial that even the moſt prejudiced hearer muſt be convinced of its truth; while the moſt unfeeling muſt have yielded for once to indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt the aſperſer, and pity of the aſperſed. Its effect upon the preſent auditors was various. The Marcheſe had liſtened to the whole explanation with an unmoved countenance, but with profound attention. Vivaldi had remained in a ſixt attitude, with eyes
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:032735_0552_0FF49997E7728A90"/>
bent on father Nicola, in ſuch eager and ſtern regard, as ſeemed to ſearch into his very ſoul; and, when the monk concluded, a ſmile of triumphant joy lighted up his features, as he looked upon the Marcheſe, and claimed an acknowledgment of his conviction, that Ellena had been calumniated. The cold glance, which the Marcheſe, returned, ſtruck the impaſſioned and generous Vivaldi to the heart, who perceived that he was not only totally indifferent as to the injuſtice, which an innocent and helpleſs young woman had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, but fancied that he was unwilling to admit the truth, which his judgment would no longer allow him to reject.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni, meanwhile, appeared almoſt to writhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the agony, which his mind inflicted upon him, and it was only by ſtrong effort, that he ſuſtained his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſo far as to go through with the interrogations he had judged it neceſſary to put to Nicola. When the ſubject was finiſhed, he ſunk back on his pillow, and, cloſing his eyes, a hue ſo pallid, ſucceeded by one ſo livid, overſpread his features, that Vivaldi for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant believed he was dying; and in this ſuppoſition he was not ſingular, for even an official was touched with the Confeſſor's condition, and had advanced to aſſiſt him, when he uncloſed his eyes, and ſeemed to revive.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſe, without making any comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the avowal of father Nicola, demanded on its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, the diſcloſure, which Schedoni had aſſerted to be intimately connected with his peace; and the latter now inquired of a perſon near him, whether a ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Inquiſition was in the chamber, who he had requeſted might attend, to take a formal depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what he ſhould declare. He was anſwered, that ſuch an one was already in waiting. He then, aſked, what other perſons were in the room, adding, that he ſhould require Inquiſitorial witneſſes to his
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:032735_0553_0FF499E79D3737B0"/>
depoſition; and was anſwered, that an Inquiſitor and two officials were preſent, and that their evidence was more than ſufficient for his purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>A lamp was then called for by the Secretary; but, as that could not immediately be procured, the torch of one of the centinels, who watched in the dark ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue without, was brought in its ſtead, and this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to Schedoni the various figures aſſembled in his duſky chamber, and to them the emaciated form and ghaſtly viſage of the Confeſſor. As Vivaldi now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him by the ſtronger light of the torch, he again fancied that death was in his aſpect.</p>
                     <p>Every perſon was now ready for the declaration of Schedoni; but he himſelf ſeemed not fully prepared. He remained for ſome moments reclining on his pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in ſilence, with his eyes ſhut, while the changes in his features indicated the ſtrong emotion of his mind. Then, as if by a violent effort, he half raiſed himſelf, and made an ample confeſſion of the arts he had prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed againſt Vivaldi. He declared himſelf to be the anonimous accuſer who had cauſed him to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted by the Holy-Office, and that the charge of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, which he had brought againſt him, was falſe and malicious.</p>
                     <p>At the moment when Vivaldi received this confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his ſuſpicions, as to the identity of his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, he diſcovered more fully that the charge was not what had been ſtated to him at the chapel of San Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian, in which Ellena was implicated; and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded an explanation of this circumſtance. Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni acknowledged, that the perſons, who had there arreſted him, were not officers of the inquiſition, and that the inſtrument of arreſt, containing the charge of elopement with a nun, was forged by himſelf, for the purpoſe of empowering the ruffians to carry off Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na without oppoſition from the inhabitants of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, in which ſhe was then lodged.</p>
                     <p>To Vivaldi's enquiry, why it had been thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:032735_0554_0FF499996DCD76C0"/>
to employ ſtratagem in the removal of Ellena, ſince, if Schedoni had only claimed her for his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he might have removed her without any, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor replied, that he was then ignorant of the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionſhip which exiſted between them. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>t to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enquiries, with what deſign, and whither Ellena had been removed, and the means by which he had diſcovered her to be his daughter, Schedoni was ſilent; and he ſunk back, overwhelmed by the recollections they awakened.</p>
                     <p>The depoſitions of Schedoni having been taken down by the Secretary, were formally ſigned by the Inquiſitor and the officials preſent; and Vivaldi thus ſaw his innocence vindicated by the very man who had thrown him among the perils of the Inquiſition. But the near proſpect or releaſe now before him failed to affect him with joy, while he underſtood that El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena was the daughter of Schedoni, the child of a murderer, whom he himſelf had been, in ſome degree, inſtrumental in bringing to a dreadful and ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous death. Still, however, willing to hope, that Schedoni had not ſpoken the truth concerning his relationſhip to Ellena he claimed, in conſideration of the affection he had ſo long cheriſhed for her, a full explanation of the circumſtance connected with the diſcovery of her family.</p>
                     <p>At this public avowed of his attachment, a haughty impatience appeared on the countenance of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſe, who forbade him to make further enquiry on the ſubject, and was immediately retiring from the chamber.</p>
                     <p>"My preſence is no longer neceſſary," he added: "the priſoner has concluded the only detail which I could be intereſted to hear from him; and, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the confeſſion he has made as to the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of my ſon, I pardon him the ſuffering, which his falſe charge has occaſioned to me and my family
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:032735_0555_0FF499E92354EC00"/>
The paper containing his depoſitions is given to your reſponſibility, holy father," addreſſing the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor; "and you are required to lay it upon the table of the Holy Office, that the innocence of Vincentio di Vivaldi may appear, and that he may be releaſed from theſe priſons without further delay. But firſt I demand a copy of thoſe declarations, and that the copy alſo ſhall be ſigned by the preſent witneſſes."</p>
                     <p>The ſecretary was now bidden to copy them, and, while the Marcheſe waited to receive the paper, (for he would not leave the chamber till he had ſecured it) Vivaldi was urging his claim for an explanation reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the family of Ellena, with unconquerable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance. Schedoni, no longer permitted to evade the inquiry, could not, however, give a circumſtantial explanation, without partly diſcloſing, alſo, the fatal deſigns which had been meditated by him and the late Marcheſa di Vivaldi, of whoſe death he was ignorant; he related, therefore, little more reſpecting Ellena than that a portrait, which ſhe wore as being her father's, had firſt led to the diſcovery of her family.</p>
                     <p>While the Confeſſor had been giving this brief ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, Nicola, who was ſomewhat withdrawn from the circle, ſtood gazing at him with the malignity of a demon. His glowing eyes juſt appeared under the edge of his cowl, while, rolled up in his dark drape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the lower features of his face were muffled; but the intermediate part of his countenance, receiving the full glare of the torch, diſplayed all its ſpeaking and terrific lines. Vivaldi, as his eye glanced upon him, ſaw again the very monk of Paluzzi, and he thought he beheld alſo a man capable of the very crimes of which he had accuſed Schedoni. At this inſtant he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered the dreadful garment that had been diſcovered in a dungeon of the fortreſs; and, yet more, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered the extraordinary circumſtances attending the death of Bianchi, together with the immediate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which the monk had diſplayed of that event. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi's
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:032735_0556_0FF4999AF54B3040"/>
ſuſpicions reſpecting the cauſe of her death, being thus revived, he determined to obtain, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, either a relief from or a confirmation of them; and he ſolemnly called upon Schedoni, who, already condemned to die, had no longer any thing to fear from a diſcloſure of the truth, whatever it might be to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare all that he knew on the ſubject. As he did ſo, he looked at Nicola, to obſerve the effect of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whoſe countenance was, however, ſo much ſhrouded, that little of its expreſſion could be ſeen; but Vivaldi remarked, that while he had ſpoken, the monk drew his garment cloſer over the lower part of his face, and that he had immediately turned his eyes from him upon the Confeſſor.</p>
                     <p>With moſt ſolemn proteſtations, Schedoni declared himſelf to be both innocent and ignorant of the cauſe of Bianchi's death.</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi then demanded by what means his agent, Nicola, had obtained ſuch immediate information, as the warning he had delivered at Paluzzi proved him to have, of an event, in which it appeared that he could be ſo little intereſted; and why that warning had been given.</p>
                     <p>Nicola did not attempt to anticipate the reply of Schedoni, who, after a momentary ſilence, ſaid, "That warning, young man, was given to deter you from viſiting Altieri, as was every circumſtance of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or intelligence, which you received beneath the arch of Paluzzi."</p>
                     <p>"Father," replied Vivaldi, "you have never loved, or you would have ſpared yourſelf the practice of arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices ſo ineffectual to miſlead or to conquer a lover. Did you believe that an anonymous adviſer could have more influence with me than my affection, or that I could be terrified by ſuch ſtratagems into a renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its object?"</p>
                     <p>"I believed," rejoined the Confeſſor, "that the diſintereſted advice if a ſtranger might have ſome
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:032735_0557_0FF499F4753EDC00"/>
weight with you; but I truſted more to the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of awe, which the conduct and ſeeming fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of that ſtranger were adapted to inſpire in a mind like your's; and I thus endeavoured to avail myſelf of your prevailing weakneſs."</p>
                     <p>"And what do you term my prevailing weakneſs?" ſaid Vivaldi, bluſhing.</p>
                     <p>"A ſuſceptibility which renders you eſpecially lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuperſtition," replied Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>"What! does a monk call ſuperſtition a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!" rejoined Vivaldi. "But grant he does, on what occaſion have I betrayed ſuch weakneſs?"</p>
                     <p>"Have you forgotten a converſation which I once held with you on inviſible ſpirits?" ſaid Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>As he aſked this, Vivaldi was ſtruck with the tone of his voice; he thought it was different from what he had remembered ever to have heard from him; and he looked at Schedoni more intently, that he might be certain it was he who had ſpoken. The Confeſſor's eyes were fixed upon him, and the repeated ſlowly in the ſame tone, "Have you forgotten?</p>
                     <p>"I have not forgotten the converſation to which you allude," replied Vivaldi, "and I do not recollect that I then diſcloſed any opinion that may juſtify your aſſertion."</p>
                     <p>"The opinions you avowed were rational," ſaid Schedoni, "but the ardour of your imagination was apparent, and what ardent imagination ever was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to truſt to plain reaſoning, or to the evidence of the ſenſes? It may not willingly confine itſelf to the dull truths, of this earth, but, eager to expand its facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to fill its capacity, and to experience its own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar delights, ſoars after new wonders into a world of its own!"</p>
                     <p>Vivivaldi bluſhed at this reproof, now conſcious of its juſtneſs; and was ſurpriſed that Schedoni ſhould ſo well have underſtood the nature of his mind, while he himſelf, with whom conjecture had never aſſumed
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:032735_0558_0FF499A4852DD610"/>
the ſtability of opinion, on the ſubject to which the Confeſſor alluded, had been ignorant even of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities,</p>
                     <p>"I acknowledge the truth of your remark," ſaid Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, "as far as it concerns myſelf. I have, however, enquiries to make on a point leſs abſtracted, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards explaining which the evidence of my ſenſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have done little. To whom belonged the bloody garments, I found in the dungeon of Paluzzi, and what became of the perſon to whom they had pertained?</p>
                     <p>Conſternation appeared for an inſtant on the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Schedoni. "What garments?" ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>"They appeared to be theſe of a perſon who had died by violence," replied Vivaldi, "and they were diſcovered in a place frequented by your avowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, Nicola the monk."</p>
                     <p>As he concluded the ſentence, Vivaldi looked at Nicola, upon whom the attention of every perſon preſent now directed.</p>
                     <p>"They were my own," ſaid this monk.</p>
                     <p>"Your own! and in that condition!<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exclaimed Vivaldi. "They were covered with gore!"</p>
                     <p>"They were my own." repeated Nicola. "For their condition, I have to thank you,—the wound your piſtol gave me occaſioned it."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi was aſtoniſhed by this apparent ſubterfuge. "I had no piſtol," he rejoined, "my ſword was my only weapon!"</p>
                     <p>"Pauſe a moment," ſaid the monk.</p>
                     <p>"I repeat that I had no fire-arms," replied Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi.</p>
                     <p>"I appeal to father Schedoni<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>' rejoined Nicola, "whether I was not wounded by a piſtol ſhot."</p>
                     <p>"To me you have no longer any right of appeal," ſaid Schedoni. "Why ſhould I ſave you from ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions, that may bring you to a ſtate like this, to which you have reduced me!"</p>
                     <p>"Your crimes have reduced you to it," replied
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:032735_0559_0FF499F612B20E78"/>
Nicola, "I have only done my duty, and that which another perſon could have affected without my aid—the prieſt to whom Spalatro made his laſt confeſſion."</p>
                     <p>"It is, however a duty of ſuch a kind," obſerved Vivaldi, "as I would not willingly have upon my conſcience. You have betrayed the life of your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer friend, and have compelled me to aſſiſt in the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction of a fellow being,"</p>
                     <p>"You, like me, have aſſiſted to deſtroy a deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er," replied the monk. "He has taken life, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, therefore, to loſe it. If, however, it will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford you conſolation to know that you have not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially aſſiſted in his deſtruction, I will hereafter give you proof for this aſſurance. There were other means of ſhewing that Schedoni was the Count di Bruno, than the teſtimony of Anſaldo, though I was ignorant of them when I bade you ſummon the penitentiary."</p>
                     <p>"If you had ſooner avowed this," ſaid Vivaldi, "the aſſertion would have been more plauſible. Now, I can only underſtand that it is deſigned to win my ſilence, and preſent my retorting upon you your own maxim—that he who has taken the life of another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to looſe his own. To whom did thoſe bloody garments belong?"</p>
                     <p>"To myſelf, I repeat," ſaid Nicola, "Schedoni can bear teſtimony that I received at Paluzzi a piſtol wound"</p>
                     <p>"Impoſſible", ſaid Vivaldi, "I was armed only with my ſword!"</p>
                     <p>"You had a companion," obſerved the monk, "had not he fire-arms?"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, after a momentary conſideration, recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Paulo had piſtols, and that he had fired one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the arch of Paluzzi, on the firſt alarm occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſtrangers voice. He immediately acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the recollection. "But I heard no groan, no ſymptom of diſtreſs!" he added. "Beſides, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were at a conſiderable diſtance from the ſpot
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:032735_0560_0FF499A60D4723B0"/>
where the piſtol was fired! How could a perſon, ſo ſeverely wounded as thoſe garments indicated, have ſilently withdrawn to a remote dungeon, or, having done ſo, is it probable he would have thrown aſide his dreſs!"</p>
                     <p>"All that is nevertheleſs true," replied Nicola. "My reſolution enabled me to ſtifle the expreſſion of my anguiſh; I withdrew to the interior of the ruin, to eſcape from you, but you purſued me even to the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, where I threw off my diſcoloured veſtments, in which I dared not return to my convent, and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a way which all your ingenuity failed to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The people who were already in the fort, for the purpoſe of aſſiſting to confine you and your ſervant during the night on which Signora Roſalba was tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from Altieri, procured me another habit, and relief for my wound. But, though I was unſeen by you during the night, I was not entirely unheard, for my groans reached you more than once from an adjoining chamber, and my companions were entertained with the alarm which your ſervant teſtified.—Are you now convinced?"</p>
                     <p>The groans were clearly remembered by Vivaldi, and many other circumſtances of Nicola's narration accorded ſo well with others, which he recollected to have occurred on the night alluded to, that he had no longer a doubt of its veracity. The ſuddenneſs of Bianchi's death, however, ſtill occaſioned him ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions as to its cauſe; yet Schedoni had declared not only that he was innocent, but ignorant of this cauſe, which it appeared from his unwillingneſs to give teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony in favour of his agent, he would not have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, had he been conſcious that the monk was in any degree guilty in this inſtance. That Nicola could have no inducement for attempting the life of Bianchi other than a reward offered him by Schedoni, was clear; and Vivaldi, after more fully conſidering theſe circumſtances, become convinced that her death
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:032735_0561_0FF499F79AE7C1A0"/>
was in conſequence of ſome accident or natural decay.</p>
                     <p>While this converſation was paſſing, the Marcheſe, impatient to put a concluſion to it, and to leave the chamber, repeatedly urged the ſecretary to diſpatch; and, while he now earneſtly renewed his requeſt, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other voice anſwered for the ſecretary, that he had nearly concluded. Vivaldi thought that he had heard the voice on ſome former occaſion, and on turning his eyes upon the perſon who had ſpoken, diſcovered the ſtranger to be the ſame who had firſt viſited him in priſon. Perceiving by his dreſs, that he was an officer of the Inquiſition, Vivaldi now underſtood too well the purport of his former viſit, and that he had come with a deſign to betray him by affected ſympathy into a confeſſion of ſome heretical opinions. Similar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of treachery Vivaldi had heard were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſed upon accuſed perſons, but he had never fully believed ſuch cruelty poſſible till now, that it had been attempted towards himſelf.</p>
                     <p>The viſit of this perſon bringing to his recollection the ſubſequent one he had received from Nicola, Vivaldi inquired whether the centinels had really ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to his cell, or he had entered it by other means! a queſtion to which the monk was ſilent, but the ſmile on his features, if ſo ſtrange an expreſſion deſerved to be called a ſmile, ſeemed to reply, "Do you believe that I, a ſervant of the Inquiſition, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray its ſecrets?"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi, however, urged the inquiry, for he wiſhed to know whether the guard, who appeared to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their office, had eſcaped the puniſhment that was threatened.</p>
                     <p>"They were honeſt," replied Nicola, "ſeek no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther."</p>
                     <p>"Are the tribunal convinced of their integrity?"</p>
                     <p>Nicola ſmiled again in deriſon, and replied, "They never doubted it."</p>
                     <p>"How!" ſaid Vivaldi. "Why were theſe men
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:032735_0562_0FF499A7944A3E90"/>
put under arreſt, if their faithfulneſs was not even ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected?"</p>
                     <p>"Be ſatisfied with the knowledge, which experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has given you of the ſecrets of the Inquiſition," replied Nicola ſolemnly, "ſeek to know no more!"</p>
                     <p>"It has terrible ſecrets!" ſaid Schedoni, who had been long ſilent. "Know, young man, that almoſt every cell of every priſoner has a concealed entrance, by which the miniſters of death may paſs unnoticed to their victims. This Nicola is now one of thoſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſummoners, and is acquainted with all the ſecret avenues, that lead to murder."</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi ſhrunk from Nicola in horror, and Schedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni pauſed; but while he had ſpoken, Vivaldi had again noticed the extraordinary change in his voice, and ſhuddered at its ſound no leſs than at the information it had given. Nicola was ſilent; but his terrible eyes were fixed in vengeance on Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>"His office has been ſhort," reſumed the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, turning his heavy eyes upon Nicola, "and his taſk is almoſt done!" As he pronounced the laſt words, his voice faultered, but they were heard by the monk, who drawing nearer to the bed demanded an explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. A ghaſtly ſmile triumphed in the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Schedoni; "Fear not but that an explanation will come full ſoon," ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>Nicola fixed himſelf before the Confeſſor, and bent his brows upon him as if he would have ſearched into his very ſoul, When Vivaldi again looked at Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni, he was ſhocked on obſerving the ſudden altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his countenance, yet ſtill a faint ſmile of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph lingered there. But, while Vivaldi gazed, the features ſuddenly became agitated: in the next inſtant his whole frame was convulſed, and heavy groans la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured from his breaſt. Schedoni was now evidently dying.</p>
                     <p>The honour of Vivaldi, and of the Marcheſe, who endeavouring to leave the chamber, was equalled only
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:032735_0563_0FF499F92250FD08"/>
by the general confuſion that reigned there; every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon preſent ſeemed to feel at leaſt a momentary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, except Nicola, who ſtood unmoved, beſide Schedoni, and looked ſtedfaſtly upon his pangs, while a ſmile of deriſon marked his countenance. As Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi obſerved, with deteſtation, this expreſſion, a ſlight ſpaſm darted over Nicola's face, and his muſcles alſo ſeemed to labour with ſudden contraction; but the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection was tranſient, and vaniſhed as abruptly as it had appeared. The monk, however, turned from the miſerable ſpectacle before him, and as he turned he caught involuntarily at the arm of a perſon near him, and leaned on his ſhoulder for ſupport. His manner appeared to betray that he had not been permitted to triumph in the ſufferings of his enemy, without parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating at leaſt in their horror.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni's ſtruggles now began to abate, and in a ſhort time he lay motionleſs. When he uncloſed his eyes, death was in them. He was yet nearly inſenſible; but preſently a faint gleam of recollection ſhot from them, and gradually lighting them up, the character of his ſoul appeared there; the expreſſion was indeed fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but it was true. He moved his lips as if he would have ſpoken, and looked languidly round the chamber, ſeemingly in ſearch of ſome perſon. At length, he uttered a ſound but he had not yet ſufficient command of his muſcles, to modulate that ſound into a word, till by repeated efforts the name of Nicola be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came intelligible. At the call, the monk raiſed his head from the ſhoulder of the perſon on whom he had reclined, and turning round, Schedoni, as was evident from the ſudden change of expreſſion in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, diſcovered him; his eyes, as they ſettled on Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola ſeemed to recollect all their wonted fire, and the malignant triumph, lately ſo prevalent in his phyſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, again appeared as in the next moment, he point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him. His glance ſeemed ſuddenly impowered with the deſtructive faſcination attributed to that of
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:032735_0564_0FF499A91A67DB70"/>
the baſiliſk, for while it now met Nicola's that monk ſeemed as if transfixed to the ſpot, and unable to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his eyes from the glare of Schedoni's; in their expreſſion he read the dreadful ſentence of his fate, the triumph of revenge and cunning. Struck with this terrible conviction, a pallid hue overſpread his face; at the ſame time an involuntary motion convulſed his features, cold trembling ſeized open his frame, and, uttering a deep groan, he fell back, and was caught in the arms of the people near him. At the inſtant of his fall, Schedoni uttered a ſound ſo ſtrange and horrible, ſo convulſed, yet ſo loud, ſo exulting, yet ſo unlike any human voice, that every perſon in the chamber, except thoſe who were aſſiſting Nicola, ſtruck with irreſiſtable terror, endeavoured to make their way out of it. This, however, was impracticable, for the door was faſtened, until a phyſician, who had been ſent for, ſhould arrive, and ſome inveſtigation could be made into this myſterious affair. The conſternation of the Marcheſe and of Vivaldi, compelled to witneſs this ſcene of horror, cannot eaſily be imagined.</p>
                     <p>Schedoni, having uttered that demonical ſound of exultation, was not permitted to repeat it, for the pangs he had lately ſuffered, returned upon him, and he was again in ſtrong convulſions, when the phyſician en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the chamber. The moment he beheld Schedoni, he declared him to be poiſoned; and he pronounced a ſimilar opinion on father Nicola<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> affirming, alſo, that the drug, as appeared from the violence of the effect, was of two ſubtle and inveterate a nature to allow of antidote. He was however, willing to adminiſter the medicine uſual in ſuch caſes.</p>
                     <p>While he was giving orders to an attendant, with reſpect to this, the violence of Schedoni' convulſions once more relaxed; but Nicola appeared in the laſt extremity. His ſufferings were, inceſſant, his ſenſes never for a moment returned, and he expired, before the medicine, which had been ſent for, could he
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:032735_0565_0FF49A052BF71C98"/>
brought. When it came, however, it was admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered with ſome ſucceſs to Schedoni, who recovered not only his recollection, but his voice; and the firſt word he uttered was, as formerly, the name of Nicola.</p>
                     <p>"Does he live? added the Confeſſor with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt difficulty, and after a long pauſe. The perſons around him were ſilent, but the truth, which this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence indicated, ſeemed to revive him.</p>
                     <p>The inquiſitor, who had attended, perceiving that Schedoni had recovered the uſe of his intellects, now judged it prudent to aſk ſome queſtions relative to his preſent condition, and to the cauſe of Nicola's death.</p>
                     <p>"Poiſon," replied Schedoni readily.</p>
                     <p>"By whom adminiſtered?" ſaid the inquiſitor, "conſider that while you anſwer, you are on your death-bed."</p>
                     <p>"I have no wiſh to conceal the truth," rejoined Schedoni, "nor the ſatisfaction"—he was obliged to cauſe, but preſently added, "I have deſtroyed him, who would have deſtroyed me, and—and I have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped an ignominous death."</p>
                     <p>He pauſed again; it was with difficulty that he had ſaid thus much, and he was now overcome by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion he had made. The ſecretary, who had not been permitted to leave the chamber, was ordered to note Schedoni's words.</p>
                     <p>"You avow then," continued the Inquiſitor, "that the poiſon was adminiſtered, both in the caſe of father Nicola, and in your own, by yourſelf?"</p>
                     <p>Schedoni could not immediately reply; but when he did he ſaid "I avow it."</p>
                     <p>He was aſked by what means he had contrived to procure the poiſon, and was bidden to name his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice.</p>
                     <p>"I had no accomplice," replied Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>"How did you procure the poiſon then?"</p>
                     <p>Schedoni, ſlowly and with difficulty, replied, "It was concealed in my veſt."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="276" facs="unknown:032735_0566_0FF499B484261E58"/>
"Conſider that you are dying," ſaid the inquiſitor, "and confeſs the truth. We cannot believe what you, have laſt aſſerted. It is improbable that you ſhould have had an opportunity of providing yourſelf with poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon after your arreſt, and equally improbable that you ſhould have thought ſuch proviſion neceſſary before that period. Confeſs who is your accomplice.'</p>
                     <p>This accuſation of falſehood recalled the ſpirit of Schedoni, which, contending with, and conquering, for a moment, corporeal ſuffering, he ſaid in a firmer tone, "It was the perſon, in which I dip my poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, the better to defend me."</p>
                     <p>The Inquiſitor ſmiled in contempt of this explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Schedoni, obſerving him, deſired a particular part of his veſt might be examined, where would be found ſome remains of the drug concealed as he had affirmed. He was indulged in his requeſt, and the poiſon was diſcovered within the broad hem of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Still it was inconceivable how he had contrived to adminiſter it to Nicola, who, though he had been for ſome time alone with him on this day, would ſcarcely have ſo far confided in an enemy, as to have accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſuſtenance that might have been offered by him. The Inquiſitor, ſtill anxious to diſcover an accomplice, aſked Schedoni who had aſſiſted to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the drug to Nicola, but the Confeſſor was no longer in a condition to reply. Life was now ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a pace: the gleam of ſpirit and of character that had returned to his eyes, was departed, and left them haggard and fixed; and preſently a lived corpſe was all that remained of the once terrible Schedoni!</p>
                     <p>While this awful event had been accompliſhing, the Marcheſe, ſuffering under the utmoſt perturbation, had withdrawn, to the diſtant grate of the dungeon, where he converſed with an official as to what might be the probable conſequence of his preſent ſituation to himſelf; but Vivaldi, in an agony of horror, had been
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:032735_0567_0FF49A06B1AC33A8"/>
calling inceſſantly for the medicine, which might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly afford ſome relief to the anguiſh he witneſſed; when it was brought, he had aſſiſted to ſupport the ſufferers.</p>
                     <p>At length, now that the worſt was over, and when ſeveral witneſſes had ſigned to the laſt avowal of Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni, every perſon in the chamber was ſuffered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; and Vivaldi was reconducted to his priſon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the Marcheſe, where he was to remain till the deciſion of the holy office reſpecting his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, as aſſerted by the depoſition of Schedoni, ſhould be known. He was too much affected by the late ſcene to give the Marcheſe any explanation at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, reſpecting the family of Ellena di Roſalba, and the Marcheſe, having remained for ſome time with his ſon, withdrew to the reſidence of his friend.</p>

                     <p>IN conſequence of the dying confeſſion of Schedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, an order was ſent from the holy office for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe of Vivaldi, within a few days after the death of the Confeſſor; and the Marcheſe conducted his ſon from the priſons of the inquiſition to the manſion of his friend the Count di Maro, with whom he had reſided ſince his arrival at Rome.</p>
                     <p>While they were receiving the ceremonious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations of the Count, and of ſome nobles aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to welcome the emancipated priſoner, a loud voice was heard from the anti-chamber exclaiming, "Let me paſs!

                     <p>In the next inſtant Paulo burſt into the ſaloon, followed by a group of lacqueys, who, however, pauſed at the door, fearful of the diſpleaſure of their lord, yet ſcarcely able to ſtifle a laugh; while Paulo, ſpringing forward, had nearly overſe ſome of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who happened at that moment to be bowing with profound joy to Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"It is my maſter! it is my maſter!" cried Paulo, and, ſending off a nobleman with each elbow, as he made his way between them, he hugged Vivaldi in his arms, repeating, "O, my maſter! my maſter!" till a a paſſion of joy and affection overcame his voice and he fell at his maſter's feet and wept.</p>
                     <p>This was a moment of finer joy to Vivaldi, than he had known ſince his meeting with his father, and he
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:032735_0569_0FF49A0837E3E068"/>
was too much intereſted by his faithful ſervant, to have leiſure to apoligize to the aſtoniſhed company for his rudeneſs. While the lacqueys were repairing the miſchief Paulo had occaſioned, were picking up the rolling ſnuff-boxes he had jerked away in his paſſage, and wiping the ſnuff from the ſoiled clothes, Vivaldi was participating in all the delight, and returning all the affection of his ſervant, and was ſo wholly occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe pleaſurable feelings as ſcarcely to be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any perſons, beſides themſelves, were in the room. The Marcheſe, meanwhile, was making a thouſand apologies for the diſaſters Paulo had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; was alternately calling upon him to recollect in whoſe preſence he was, and to quit the apartment immediately: explaining to the company that he had not ſeen Vivaldi ſince they were together in the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and remarking profoundly, that he was much attached to his maſter. But Paulo, inſenſible to the repeated commands of the Marcheſe, and to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of Vivaldi to raiſe him, was ſtill pouring forth his whole heart at his maſter's feet. "Ah! my Signor," ſaid he, "If you could but know how miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable I was when I got out of the inquiſition!"—</p>
                     <p>"He raves!" obſerved the count to the Marcheſe, "you perceive that joy had rendered him delirious!"</p>
                     <p>"How I wandered about the walls half the night, and what it coſt me to leave them! But when I loſt ſight of them, Signor, O! San Dominico! I thought my heart would have broke. I had a great mind to have gone back again and given myſelf up: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſhould I too, if it had not been for my friend, the centinel, who eſcaped with me, and I would not do him an injury, poor fellow! for he meant nothing but kindneſs when he let me out. And ſure enough, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The contraſt of his preſent joy, to his remembered
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:032735_0570_0FF499B78F4CD308"/>
grief, again brought tears into Paulo's eyes: he ſmiled and wept, and ſobbed and laughed with ſuch rapid tranſition, that Vivaldi began to be alarmed for him; when, ſuddenly becoming calm, he looked up in his maſter's face, and ſaid gravely, but with eagerneſs, "Pray Signor, was nor the roof of your little priſon peaked, and was there not a little turret ſtuck up at one corner of it? and was there not a battlement round the turret? and was there not"—Vivaldi, after regarding him for a moment, replied ſmilingly, "Why, truly, my good Paulo, my dungeon was ſo far from the roof, that I never had an opportunity of obſerving it."</p>
                     <p>"This is very true Signor." replied Paulo, "very true, indeed; but I did not happen to think of that. I am certain, though it was as I ſay, and I was ſure of it at the time. O Signor! I thought that roof would have broke my heart, O how I did look at it! and now to think that I am here, with my dear maſter once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain!"</p>
                     <p>As Paulo concluded, his tears and ſobs returned with more violence than before; and Vivaldi, who could not perceive any neceſſary connection between this mention of the roof of his late priſon, and tee joy his ſervant expreſſed on ſeeing him again, began to fear that his ſenſes were bewildered, and deſired an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of his words. Paulo's account, rude and ſimple as it was, ſoon diſcovered to him the relation of theſe apparently heterogeneous circumſtances to each other; when Vivaldi, overcome by this new inſtance of the power of Paulo's affection, embraced him with his whole heart, and compelling him to riſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him to the aſſembly as his faithful friend and chief deliverer.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſe affected by the ſome he had wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, and with the truth of Vivaldi's words, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to give Paulo a hearty ſhake by the hard, and to thank him warmly for the bravery and fidelity he
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:032735_0571_0FF49A09C2BCD610"/>
had diſplayed in his maſter's intereſt. "I never can fully reward your attachment, added the Marcheſe, "but what remains for me to do, ſhall be done. From this moment I make you independent, and promiſe in the preſence of this noble company, to give you a thouſand ſequins as ſome acknowledgment of your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices."</p>
                     <p>Paulo did not expreſs all the gratitude for this gift which the Marcheſe expected. He ſtammered, and bowed and bluſhed, and at length burſt into tears; and when Vivaldi inquired what diſtreſſed him, he replied, "Why, Signor, of what uſe are the thouſand, ſequins to me, if I am to be independent! what uſe if I am not to ſtay with you?"</p>
                     <p>Vivaldi cordially aſſured Paulo, that he ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remain with him, and that he ſhould conſider it as his duty to render his future life happy. "You ſhall henceforth," added Vivaldi, "be placed at the head of my houſhold; the management of my ſervants, and the whole conduct of my domeſtic concerns ſhall be committed to you, as a proof of my entire confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in your integrity and attachment; and becauſe this is a ſituation which will allow you to be always near me."</p>
                     <p>"Thank you, my Signor," replied Paulo, in a voice rendered almoſt inarticulate by his gratitude, "Thank you with my whole heart! if I ſtay with you, that is enough for me, I aſk no more. But I hope my Lord Marcheſe will not think me ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for refuſing to accept of the thouſand ſequins he was ſo kind as to offer me, if I would be but independent, for I thank him as much as if I had received them, and a great deal more too."</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſe, ſmiling at Paulo's miſtake, rejoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "As I do not perceive, my good friend, how your remaining with your maſter can be a circumſtance to diſqualify you from accepting a thouſand ſequins, I command you, on pain of my diſpleaſures, to receive
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:032735_0572_0FF499B914DCC648"/>
them; and whenever you marry, I ſhall expect that you will ſhew your obedience to me again, by accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another thouſand from me with your wife, as her dower."</p>
                     <p>"This is too much, Signor," ſaid Paulo, ſobbing—"too much to be borne!" and ran out of the ſaloon. But amidſt the murmur of applauſe which his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct drew from the noble ſpectators, for Paulo's warm heart had ſubdued even the coldneſs of their pride, a convulſive ſound from the anti-chamber betrayed the exceſs of emotion, which he had thus abruptly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn himſelf to conceal.</p>
                     <p>In a few hours, the Marcheſe and Vivaldi took leave of their friends, and ſet out for Naples, where they arrived, without any interruption, on the fourth day. But it was a melancholy journey to Vivaldi, notwithſtanding the joy of his late eſcape; for the Marcheſe having introduced the mention of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to Ellena di Roſalba, informed him, that, under the preſent unforeſeen circumſtances, he could not conſider his late engagement to the Marcheſa on that ſubject binding, and that Vivaldi muſt relinquiſh Ellena, if it ſhould appear that ſhe really was the daughter of the late Schedoni.</p>
                     <p>Immediately on his arrival at Naples, however, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, with a degree of impatience, to which his utmoſt ſpeed was inadequate, and with a revived joy ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful as to overcome every fear, and every melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſideration, which the late converſation with his father had occaſioned, haſtened to the <hi>Santa della Pieta.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ellena heard his voice from the grate, enquiring for her of a nun, who was in the parlour, and in the next inſtant they, beheld each other yet once again.</p>
                     <p>In ſuch a meeting, after the long uncertainty and terror which each had ſuffered for the fate of the other, and the dangers and hardſhips they had really incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, joy was exalted almoſt to agony. Ellena wept,
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:032735_0573_0FF46ED5787D9410"/>
and ſome minutes paſſed before ſhe could anſwer to Vivaldi's few words of tender exclamation: it was long ere ſhe was tranquil enough to obſerve the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which ſevere confinement had given to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. The animated expreſſion of his counten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was unchanged; yet, when the firſt glow of joy had faded from it, and Ellena had leiſure to obſerve its wanneſs, ſhe underſtood, too certainly, that he had been a priſoner in the Inquiſition.</p>
                     <p>During this interview, he related, at Ellena's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, the particulars of his adventures, ſince he had been ſeparated from her in the chapel of San Sebaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but, when he came to that part of the narration where it was neceſſary to mention Schedoni, he pauſed in unconquerable embarraſſment and a diſtreſs not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with horror. Vivaldi could ſcarcely endure even to hint to Ellena any part of the unjuſt conduct, which the confeſſor had practiſed towards him, yet it was impoſſible to conclude his account without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing much more than hints; nor could he bear to afflict her with a knowledge of the death of him who he believed to be her parent, however the dreadful cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of that event might be concealed. His embarraſſment became obvious, and was ſtill increaſed by Ellena's inquiries.</p>
                     <p>At length, as an introduction to the information it was neceſſary to give, and to the fuller explanation he wiſhed to receive upon a ſubject, which, though it was the one that preſſed moſt anxiouſly upon his mind, he had not yet dared to mention, Vivaldi ventured to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his knowledge of her having diſcovered her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to be living. The ſatisfaction immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent upon Ellena's countenance heightened his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and his reluctance to proceed; believing, as he did, that the event he had to communicate muſt change her gladneſs to grief.</p>
                     <p>Ellena, however, upon his mention of a topic ſo intereſting to them both, proceeded to expreſs the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:032735_0574_0FF499C49B31F1D0"/>
ſhe had received from the diſcovery of a parent, whoſe virtues had even won her affection long before ſhe underſtood her own intereſt in them. It was with ſome difficulty, that Vivaldi could conceal his ſurprize at ſuch an avowal of prepoſſeſſion; the manners of Schedoni, of whom he believed her to ſpeak, having certainly never been adapted to inſpire tenderneſs. But his ſurprize ſoon changed its objects when Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via, who had heard that a ſtranger was at the grate entered the parlour, and was announced as the mother of Ellena di Roſalba.</p>
                     <p>Before Vivaldi left the convent, a full explanation, as to family, was given on both ſides, when he had the infinite joy of learning, that Ellena was not the daughter of Schedoni; and Olivia had the ſatisfaction to know that ſhe had no future evil to apprehend from him who had hitherto been her worſt enemy. The manner of his death, however, with all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his character, as unfolded by his late trial, Vivaldi was careful to conceal.</p>
                     <p>When Ellena had withdrawn from the room, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi made a full acknowledgment to Olivia of his long attachment to her daughter, and ſupplicated for her conſent to their marriage. To this application, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Olivia replied, that, though ſhe had long been no ſtranger to their mutual affection, or to the ſeveral circumſtances which had both proved its durability, and tried their fortitude, ſhe never could conſent that her daughter ſhould become a member of any family, whoſe principal was either inſenſible of her value, or unwilling to acknowledge it; and that in this inſtance it would be neceſſary to Vivaldi's ſucceſs, not only that he, but that his father ſhould be a ſuitor; on which condition only, ſhe allowed him to hope for her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence.</p>
                     <p>Such a ſtipulation ſcarcely chilled the hopes of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi, now that Ellena was proved to be the daughter, not of the murderer Schedoni but of a Count di Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:032735_0575_0FF49A14F4273A10"/>
no, who had been no leſs reſpectable in character than in rank; and he had little doubt that his father would conſent to fulfil the promiſe he had given to the dying Marcheſa.</p>
                     <p>In this belief he was not miſtaken. The Marcheſe, having attended to Vivaldi's account of Ellena's fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, promiſed, that if it ſhould appear there was no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond miſtake on the ſubject, he would not longer op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the wiſhes of his ſon.</p>
                     <p>The Marcheſe immediately cauſed a private inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be made, as to the identity of Olivia the preſent Counteſs di Bruno; and though this was not purſued without difficulty, the phyſician, who had aſſiſted in the plan of her eſcape from the cruelty of Ferando di Bruno, and who was living, as well as Beatrice, who clearly remembered the ſiſter of her late miſtreſs, at length rendered Olivia's identity unqueſtionable.—Now, therefore, that the Marcheſe's every doubt was removed he paid a viſit to the <hi>Santa della Pieta,</hi> and ſolicited, in due form, Olivia's conſent to the nuptials of Vivaldi with Ellena; which ſhe granted him with an entire ſatisfaction. In this interview, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſe was ſo faſcinated by the manners of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, and pleaſed with the delicacy and ſweetneſs, which appeared in thoſe of Ellena, that his conſent was no longer a conſtrained one, and he willingly relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the views of ſuperiour rank and fortune, which he had formerly looked to for his ſon, for thoſe of virtue &amp; permanent happineſs that were now unfolded to him.</p>
                     <p>On the twentieth of May, the day on which Ellena completed her eighteenth years, her nuptials with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valdi were ſolemniſed in the church of the <hi>Santa Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria della Pieta,</hi> in the preſence of the Marcheſe and of the Counteſs di Bruuo. As Ellena advanced through the church, ſhe recollected, when on a former occaſion ſhe had met Vivaldi at the altar, and, the ſcenes of San Sebaſtian riſing to her memory, the happy cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of thoſe, which her preſent ſituation oppoſed to
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:032735_0576_0FF499C620C93810"/>
them, drew tears of tender joy and gratitude to her eyes. Then, irreſolute, deſolate, ſurrounded by ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and enſnared by enemies, ſhe had believed ſhe ſaw Vivaldi for the laſt time; now, ſupported by the preſence of a beloved parent, and by the willing appro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oation of the perſons, who had hitherto ſo ſtrenuouſly oppoſed her, they were met to part no more; and, as a recollection of the moment when ſhe had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from the chapel glanced upon her mind, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when ſhe had called upon him for ſuccour, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated even to hear his voice once more, and when a blank ſilence, which, as ſhe believed, was that if death, had ſucceeded; as the anguiſh of that moment was now remembered, Ellena became more than ever ſenſible of the happineſs of the preſent.</p>
                     <p>Olivia, in thus relinquiſhing her daughter ſo ſoon after ſhe had found her, ſuffered ſome pain, but ſhe was conſoled by the fair proſpect of happineſs, that opened to Ellena, and cheered by conſidering, that, though ſhe relinquiſhed, ſhe ſhould not loſe her, ſince the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity of Vivaldi's reſidence to <hi>La Pieta,</hi> would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a frequent intercourſe with the convent.</p>
                     <p>As a teſtimony of ſingular eſteem, Paulo was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be preſent at the marriage of his maſter, when as perched in a high gallery of the church, he looked down upon the ceremony, and witneſſed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Vivaldi's countenance, the ſatisfaction in that of my "old Lord Marcheſe," the penſive happineſs in the Counteſs di Bruno's, and the tender compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of Ellena's which her veil, partly undrawn, allowed him to obſerve, he could ſcarcely refrain from expreſſing the joy he felt, and ſhouting aloud, "<hi>O! giorno felice!

                     <p>THE fete which, ſome time after the nuptials, was given by the Marcheſe, in celebration of them, was held at a delightful villa, belonging to Vivaldi, a few miles diſtant from Naples, upon the border of the gulf, and on the oppoſite ſhore to that which had been the frequent abode of the Marcheſe. The beauty of its ſituation, and its interior elegance induced Vival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di and Ellena to ſelect it as their chief reſidence. It was, in truth, a ſcence of fairy-land. The pleaſure grounds extended over a valley, which opened to the bay, and the houſe ſtood at the entrance of this valley, upon a gentle ſlope that margined the water, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the whole extent of its luxuriant ſhores, from the lofty cape of Miſeno to the bold mountains of the ſouth, which, ſtretching acroſs the diſtance, appeared to riſe out of the ſea, and divided the gulf of Naples, from that of Salerno.</p>
                     <p>The marble porticoes and arcades of the villa were ſhadowed by groves of the beautiful magnolia flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering aſh, cedrati camellias, and majeſtic palms; and the cool and airy hills, opening on two oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite fires to a colonade, admitted beyond the rich foliage all the ſeas and ſhores of Naples, from the weſt; and to the caſt, views of the valley of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, withdrawing among winding hills, wooded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

heads, and threw gay gleams of light amidſt the um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brageous landſcape.</p>
                     <p>The ſtyle of the gardens, where lawns and groves and woods varied the undulating ſurface, was that of England, and of the preſent day, rather than of Italy; except "Where a long alley peeping on the main," exhibited ſuch gigantic loftineſs of ſhade, and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of perſpective, as characterize the Italian taſte.</p>
                     <p>On this jubilee, every avenue and grove, and pavili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was richly illuminated. The villa itſelf, where each airy hall and arcade was reſplendent with lights, and laviſhly decorated with flowers and the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſhrubs, whoſe buds ſeemed to pour all Arabia's preſumes upon the air, this villa reſembled a fabric call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by enchantment, rather than a ſtructure of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man art.</p>
                     <p>The dreſſes of the higher rank of viſitors were as ſplendid as the ſcenery, of which Ellena was, in every reſpect, the queen. But this entertainment was not given to perſons of diſtinction only, for both Vivaldi and Ellena had wiſhed that all the tenants of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſhould partake of it, and ſhare the abundant hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which themſelves poſſeſſed; ſo that the grounds, which were extenſive enough to accommodate each rank, were relinquiſhed to a general gaiety. Paulo was on this occaſion, a ſort of maſter of the revels; and ſurrounded by a party of his own particular aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, danced once more, as he had ſo often wiſhed, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the moonlight ſhore of Naples.</p>
                     <p>As Vivaldi and Ellena were paſſing the ſpot, which Paulo, had choſen for the ſcene of his feſtivity, they pauſed to obſerve his ſtrange capers and extravagant geſticulation, as he mingled in the dance, while every now-and-then, he ſhouted forth, though half breathleſs with the heartineſs of the exerciſe—"<hi>O! giorno felice! O! giorno felice!</hi>"</p>
                     <p>On perceiving Vivaldi, and the ſmiles with which he and Ellena regarded him, he quitted his ſports, and

advancing, "Ah! my dear maſter," ſaid he, "do you remember the night, when we were travelling on the banks of the Celano, before that diabolical acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent happened in the chapel of San Sebaſtian; don't you remember how theſe people, who were tripping it away ſo joyouſly, by moonlight, reminded me of Naples and the many merry dances I had footed on the beach here?"</p>
                     <p>"I remember it well," replied Vivaldi.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! Signor <hi>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The firſt part of your hope, my dear maſter, you was out in; for, as it happened, we had to go through purgatory before we could reach paradiſe; but the ſecond part is come at laſt; for here I am, ſure enough! dancing by moonlight, in my own dear bay of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, with my own dear maſter and miſtreſs, in ſafety, and as happy <hi>almoſt</hi> as myſelf; and with that old mountain yonder, Veſuvius, which I, forſooth! thought I was never to ſee again, ſpouting up fire, juſt as it uſed to do before we got ourſelves put into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition! O! who could have foreſeen all this! <hi>O! giorno felice! O! giorno felice!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"I rejoice in your happineſs my good Paulo," ſaid Vivaldi, "almoſt as much as in my own; though I do not entirely agree with you as to the comparative proportion of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ach."</p>
                     <p>"Paulo!" ſaid Ellena, "I am indebted to you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any ability to repay: for, to your intrepid affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion your maſter owes his preſent ſafety. I will not attempt to thank you for your attachment to him; my care of your welfare ſhall prove how well I know it; but I wiſh to give to all your friends this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of your worth, and of my ſenſe of it."</p>
                     <p>Paulo, bowed, and ſtammered, and writhed and bluſhed, and was unable to reply; till, at length, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

a lofty ſpring from the ground, the emotion which had nearly ſtifled him burſt forth in words, and "<hi>O! giorno felice! O! giorno felice!</hi>" flew from his lips with the force of an electric ſhock. They communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his enthuſiaſm to the whole company, the words paſſed like lightning from one individual to another, till Vivaldi and Ellena withdrew amidſt a choral ſhout, and all the woods and ſtrands of Naples re-ech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oed with—"<hi>O! giorno felice! O! giorno felice!</hi>"</p>
                     <p>"You ſee," ſaid Paulo, when they had departed and he came to himſelf again, "you ſee how people get through their misfortunes, if they have but a heart to bear up againſt them, and do nothing that can lie on their conſcience afterwards: and how ſuddenly one comes to be happy, juſt when one is beginning to think one never is to be happy again! Who would have gueſſed that my dear maſter and I, when we were clapped up in that diabolical place, the Inquiſition, ſhould ever come out again into this world! Who would have gueſſed when we were taken before thoſe old devils of Inquiſitors, ſitting there all of a row in a place under ground, hung with black, and nothing but torches all around, and faces grinning at us, that but looked as black as the gentry aforeſaid; and when I was not ſo much as ſuffered to open my mouth, no I they would not let me open my mouth to my maſter!—who, I ſay, would have gueſſed we ſhould ever be let looſe again! who would have thought we ſhould ever know what it is to be happy! Yet here we are all abroad once more! All at liberty! And may run, if we will, ſtraight forwards, from one end of the earth to the other, and back again without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtopped! May fly in the ſea, or ſwim in the ſky, or tumble over head and heels into the moon! For, remember, my good friends, we have no lead in our conſciences to keep us down!"</p>
                     <p>"You mean ſwim in the ſea, and fly in the ſky, I ſuppoſe," obſerved a grave perſonage near him, "but
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:032735_0581_0FF49A221CEF8C08"/>
as for tumbling over head and heels into the moon! I don't know what you mean by that!"</p>
                     <p>"Pſhaw!" replied Paulo, "who can ſtop, at ſuch a time as this, to think about what he means! I wiſh that all thoſe, who on this night are not merry enough to ſpeak before they think, may ever after be grave enough to think before they ſpeak! But you, none of you, no! not one of you! I warrant, ever ſaw the roof of a priſon, when your maſter happened to be below in the dungeon, nor know what it is to be forced to run away, and leave him, behind to die by himſelf. Poor ſouls! But no matter for that, you can be tolerably happy, perhaps, notwithſtanding; but as for gueſſing how happy I am, or knowing any thing about the matter—O! its quite beyond what you can underſtand. <hi>O! giorno felice! O! giorno felice!</hi>" repeated Paulo, as he bounded forward to mingle in the dance, and "<hi>O! giorno felice</hi>" was again ſhouted in chorus by his joyful companions.</p>
