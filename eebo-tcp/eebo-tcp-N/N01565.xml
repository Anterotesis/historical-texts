            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PLALM LXXVIII. 72.</bibl>
               <q>So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart: and guided them by the Skilfulneſs of his bands.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>GREAT Accompliſhments are needful, for the right managing of Great Affairs. The <hi>well Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning</hi> of a <hi>Profeſſing People</hi> of God, is a very great Affair in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; and very eminent Qualifications are needful for it. Our Text gives an Inſtance, of the well Governing of a Profeſſing Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; and of the Qualifications need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

thereto, and exerted therein. For it tells us concerning <hi>David,</hi> who was <hi>King</hi> over <hi>Iſrael</hi> God's Profeſſing People, that <hi>he fed them according to the Integrity of his heart, and guided them by the Skilfulneſs of his hands.</hi> This <hi>Pſalm</hi> whereof our Text is the cloſe, gives us an account of God's wonderful Appearances for, and merciful Dealings with, His People Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael in Egypt; of His Mercy in bringing them thence, protecting and ſupplying them in the Wilderneſs, bringing them into <hi>Canaan</hi> and poſſeſſing them of that good Land; and of His kind Diſpenſations to them for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time after. It alſo gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, of the unſuitable returns which Iſrael made, to the God and Giver of all their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: it relates their ungrateful, diſobedient carriage to God. This Hiſtory, which briefly relates ſundry Grand Articles of Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards Iſrael, and of their behaviour towards God, for the ſpace of <hi>between Four and Five Hundred Years,</hi> (1 King. 6. 1.) I ſay, this Hiſtory ſeems to preſent us, with a ſort of <hi>Conteſt</hi> between the Bounty, Mercy and Kindneſs of God; and the Ingratitude and Diſobedience of His People, as tho' there were a ſtrife which ſhould overcome. And if we may look on this matter as a ſort of <hi>Conteſt,</hi> then God (<hi>who is merciful and gracious,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001861_0009_0FB91EF655C7A730"/>
ſlow to anger &amp; plenteous in mercy,</hi> Pſal. 103. 8) comes off Conqueror at laſt. For tho' He ſeveral times ſorely and ſharply chaſten'd them, and in His Providence plainly teſtify'd againſt their groſs Tranſgreſſions; yet on the other hand, <hi>He being full of compaſſion, forgave their iniquity, and deſtroyed them not; yea</hi> MANY <hi>a</hi> TIME <hi>turned be his anger away, and did not ſtir up all hiſ Wrath.</hi> ver. 38. Tho'God often made them ſmart for their ill carriage, yet their Puniſhments were not ſo ſevere as their Sins deſerved. <hi>He dealt not with them after their Sins, neither rewarded them according to their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,</hi> Pſal. 103. 10. He did not yet utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt them off from being His People, nor utterly take His loving kindneſs from them; but His Mercy triumphed over their unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs. For the Hiſtory in this Pſalm is clos'd, in relating a great and remarkable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of God's kindneſs to His People; even in ſetting an <hi>Able, Faithful and Godly Ruler ever them.</hi> This is mention'd (and that very juſtly) as a plain, evident Inſtance of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant care of, and goodneſs to, his People, <hi>ver.</hi> 70, 7I. <hi>He choſe David alſo his Servant, and took him from the Sheep folds; from following the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

and an <hi>eminent</hi> Servant of God he was, to whom God himſelf gave teſtimony ſaying, <hi>I have found David the Son of Jeſſe, a man after mine own heart, which ſhall fulfill all my will,</hi> Act. 13.22. Note by the way,</p>
            <p>The more any Perſon <hi>is after God's own heart,</hi> the more Inclin'd <hi>to fulfil his will</hi>; ſo much the more fit he is to be a <hi>Ruler.</hi> This <hi>David,</hi> had been a <hi>Shepherd</hi> in a proper and literal ſenſe, he had kept his Father's Sheep, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.11, 19. &amp; 17.15. God calls him from this work, to be a <hi>Political Shepherd</hi> to <hi>Iſrael</hi> his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Profeſſing People. God's People, are ſometimes compar'd to <hi>Sheep,</hi> to a <hi>Flock</hi> of them, (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.17. Pſal. 80.1.) and ſo <hi>David's</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing call'd to <hi>govern them,</hi> is call'd a <hi>Feeding</hi> of them. And whom muſt <hi>David, Feed?</hi> Why <hi>Jacob, Iſrael, God's People, God's Inheritance.</hi> They were a People near and dear to God; in a peculiar, fingular, diſtinguiſhing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>God's ſpecial Propriety,</hi> His <hi>Inheritance, Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> his <hi>Peculiar treaſure above all People,</hi> Exod. 19.5. <hi>For the Lord's Portion is his People; Jacob is the Lot of his Inheritance,</hi> Deut. 32.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> I.35.4. It was an high and honourable, weighty and important work, to govern a People thus diſtinguiſhingly <hi>near to God</hi>; <hi>His</hi> peculiar trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, portion and inheritance. Well, our Text tells us, <hi>how, David</hi> manag'd himfelf in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001861_0005_0FB91EE6955808F8"/>
governing this People; he <hi>fed &amp; guided</hi> them. The Phraſe is Metaphorical, it alludes to the practice of <hi>Shepherds</hi> who conſult the <hi>good of their Sheep</hi>; and therefore indeavour to <hi>lead</hi> and <hi>guide</hi> them in right ways, to keep them from ſtragling and ſtraying, from walking in paths that would be dangerous and hurtful to them. This <hi>feeding</hi> them, ſignifies alſo a kind, tender care to ſee them <hi>well provided for</hi>; a <hi>making them to lye down in green paſtures, a lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by ſtill waters,</hi> (Pſal. 23.2.) a taking care, that they may <hi>go in and out, and find Paſture,</hi> Job. 10.9. <hi>Feeding</hi> and <hi>Guiding</hi> them imports, a thoughtful, ſollicitous, induſtrious care, for the good &amp; welfare of God's Sheep, his profeſſing People. Further ſtill <hi>David</hi> did thus <hi>Feed</hi> and <hi>Guide</hi> them,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>According to the integrity of his heart.</hi> It ſeems his <hi>Heart</hi> was ingag'd in the work, the weight and importance of it came home to his <hi>heart,</hi> it lay cloſe and near to his Spirit. He look'd not on it as a work by the by, as a trivial buſineſs of ſmall concern; but his very. Soul was indeed ingag'd in it. And truly, ſince ſuch a valuable <hi>Depoſitum,</hi> ſuch a <hi>peculiar Treaſure</hi> as <hi>Gods Covenant People</hi> were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, and betruſted with him; 'twas highly reaſonable and needful, that his very <hi>heart,</hi> his Soul ſhould be diligently imploy'd in

caring for them, and in promoting their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. Rich Jewels and Treaſures, ſhould be diligently and carefully look'd to, that they may be kept well and ſafe; but there are no Jewels or Treaſures in the World, of ſo high a price and value as God's Covenant People are. They are dear to God as the <hi>Apple of his Eye,</hi> Zech. 2.8 Well, <hi>David</hi> imploy'd his Heart, yea <hi>Integrity</hi> of heart in <hi>feeding</hi> God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in governing of them. <hi>Integrity,</hi> the word ſignifies (as <hi>Criticks</hi> obſerve) <hi>Upright, Perfect, Sincere, Honeſt</hi> and <hi>without Guile</hi>: ſuch was his <hi>Heart</hi> in Feeding them.</p>

(I.) <hi>Thoſe who are in Civil Government among a Profeſſing People of God ſhould Feed and Guide them.</hi> (2.) <hi>They ſhould do it with Integrity.</hi> (3.) <hi>They ſhould do it with Skilfulneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>PROP. I.</hi> Thoſe who are in Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among a Profeſſing People of God, ſhould Feed and Guide them.</p>
            <p>Here it would be eaſy (and poſſibly, not altogether unneceſſary) to premiſe,</p>
            <p>That there are various forms of Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment among Men, as <hi>Monarchical, Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical, Democratical,</hi> and ſome of a mixed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I ſhall add nothing by way of <hi>Compariſon,</hi> to ſay which of theſe is moſt or leaſt eligible.</p>
            <p>Perſons concerned in the Government of a People, may have <hi>various or different buſineſs</hi> aſſign'd to them: ſome may be concern'd in the <hi>Ligiſlative</hi> part, to <hi>make Laws</hi> for the good of a People, and ſome in the <hi>Executive</hi> part, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> good Laws <hi>well Executed</hi>: and ſome, poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; (tho' under different conſiderations) may be concern'd in both. Again,</p>
            <p>There are different <hi>Poſts</hi> or <hi>Stations</hi> in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſome <hi>Superior</hi> and ſome <hi>Inferior.</hi> Thus we read of the <hi>King</hi> as <hi>Supream,</hi> and of <hi>Governours as ſent by him,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.13, 14.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001861_0011_0FB91EF9568774C0"/>
So, there are other different Ranks, Stations, Degrees beſides <hi>theſe two</hi> here mentioned. Conſequently.</p>
            <p>Thoſe <hi>Abilities</hi> or <hi>Endowments</hi> may compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently fit or <hi>qualify</hi> a Perſon, <hi>for one Part or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in Government, which may <hi>not for another.</hi> There were in Iſrael, <hi>Rulers of Thouſands, Rulers of Hundreds, Rulers of Fifties, and Rulers of Tens,</hi> Exod. 18 22, 25, 26. Thoſe may poſſibly be qualify'd for ſome <hi>Inferior</hi> place in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which are not for a <hi>Superior.</hi> The like degree of Skill, Wiſdom, Prudence is not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to qualify a Perſon for one Station or Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in Government, which is needful for another that is much Superior &amp; more difficult.</p>
            <p>Therefore what I ſhall ſay concerning the <hi>Qualifications</hi> and <hi>Duties</hi> of thoſe in Authority, is to be underſtood generally &amp; extenſively; and ſo to be particularly applied according to the different Stations any ſuſtain in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for that may be the proper buſineſs of ſome, which others are not immediately at all concern'd to meddle in.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things being premiſed, we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain aſſert,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thoſe who are in Civil Government among a profeſſing People of God, ſhould Feed and Guide them.</hi> This <hi>Feeding</hi> and <hi>Guiding</hi> of them, muſt needs ſignifie and comprehend in it (as was hinted
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001861_0012_0FB91EFC58023D80"/>
in opening the Words) their <hi>indeavouring the true Good Welfare</hi> and <hi>Proſperity of their People. Plato</hi> could ſay, <hi>The People were not made for the Governour, but the Governour for the People.</hi> And this ſeems agreable to Rom. 13.4. <hi>He is the Miniſter of God to thee Good.</hi> Thoſe who Govern among a proſending People, ſhould very carefully indeavour the true Welfare of their People. Therefore they ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, (I.) <hi>That their People may do Good.</hi> (2) <hi>That they may injoy Good.</hi> (3) <hi>They ſhould indeavour to make Good Laws, and to ſee them well Executed, in order hereunto.</hi> Rulers ſhould In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That their People may do Good.</hi> Their <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good,</hi> I here take in a general comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſenſe, to ſignifie their <hi>Living obediently to God's revealed preceptive will</hi> (as the Goſpel teaches, Tit. 2.12.) <hi>their denying ungodineſs and worldly luſts; and living ſoberly, righteouſly, godlily in this preſent world.</hi> Mic. 6.8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> It is good for Perſons, to turn from Sin to God in Chriſt Jeſus, to live holily: this is <hi>good</hi> in a <hi>moral</hi> ſenſe, it's the duty of all under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, 'tis what God requires of them. And their thus doing duty, their being ſincerely and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001861_0013_0FB91F02BB572598"/>
practically religious and vertuous; has a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect <hi>natural</hi> tendercy in many regards, to promote their outward good &amp; welfare (as well as their inward comfort and joy) here in this preſent World. And further ſtill, their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Goſpel, their conforming to God's revealed preceptive will, has a <hi>moral</hi> or fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tendency to promote their trueſt Welfare, both in this World &amp; in the next. Iſai. 3.10. <hi>Say to the righteous, that it ſhall be well with him, for they ſhall eat the fruit of their doings.</hi> 1 Tim. 4 8. <hi>Godlineſs is proſitable to all things, having the promiſe of the life that now is and of that which is 'to come.</hi> He that is wife, is proſitable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. If a Perſon or People heartily obey God, the advantage will be their own. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to Iſrael, Deut. 6.24. <hi>And the Lord commaded us to do all thiſe Statutes: to fear the Lordour God, FOR OUR GOOD always, that he might preſerve us alive as it is this day.</hi> And God ſaid of them, Deut. 5.29. <hi>Oh that there Were ſuch an heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments always, that is might be well with them, and with their children forever.</hi> The Prophet ſaid to God's People, 2 Chron. 15.2,— <hi>The Lord is with you, while ye be with him; if ye ſeek him, he will be found of you: but if ye forſake him, he will forſake you.</hi> For a People to be Pious, is the way to be Proſperous. Deut. 29.19. <hi>Keep
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001861_0014_0FB91F06610E2C68"/>
therefore the words of this Covenant, and do them that ye may proſper in all that ye do.</hi> 2 Chron. 24.20.—<hi>Thus ſaith God, why tranſgreſs ye the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Lord, that ye cannot proſper? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye have for ſaken the Lord, he alſo bath forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken you. When a mans ways pleaſe the Lord, be maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him,</hi> Prov, 16.7. This is as true of a <hi>People</hi> as of a <hi>Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's undeniably evident from theſe things, that it's <hi>Good, Proſitable, Advantagious</hi> to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing People, to live obediently unto God. God Iſ the Supream, Soveraign Maker, Owner and Ruler of all things. <hi>His Kingdom ruleth over all;</hi> and His Dominion is an Everlaſting Dominion. Nothing but his bounty &amp; kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, can make a Perſon or People eaſy and comfortable, in Body or Soul, in Time or to Eternity. It's therefore <hi>Heatheniſh,</hi> or rather <hi>Atheiſtical,</hi> to deny that it's proſitable for a People to obey God. That <hi>cuning</hi> or <hi>policy,</hi> thoſe <hi>contrivances</hi> or <hi>alliances</hi> which put them upon doing things provoking to God; will ſooner or later appear to be, <hi>ſenſeleſs folly,</hi> or <hi>miſchievous craft</hi> (like <hi>Gideons</hi> Ephod, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.27.) 'twill prove a <hi>Snare</hi> to them. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Mens cuning or policy may ſuggeſt, yet <hi>their iniquities will ſeparate between them &amp; their God: their ſins will bide away his face that he will

not bear,</hi> Iſai. 59.2. <hi>Righteouſneſs exilteth a Nation, but ſin is a reproach to any People,</hi> Prov 14.34. Now inaſmuch as it is for the good and advantage of a proſeſſing People, to <hi>do God, to know &amp; do God's Will</hi>; therefore thoſe in Authority ſhould endeavour, to incourage and further ſuch <hi>Knowlege &amp; Obedience</hi> in them. They are true <hi>Feeders</hi> and <hi>Leaders</hi> of their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when they do their utmoſt to make them <hi>know</hi> and <hi>obey God.</hi> Thoſe in Authority there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould incourage thoſe things, which tend to promote in their People, the <hi>Knowlege</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of God's holy Will I might briefly Inſtance in a few things having ſuch a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency among us, <hi>viz</hi> The incouraging (I.) <hi>Good Order in Families.</hi> (2.) <hi>Schools.</hi> (3)<hi>The Colledge.</hi> (4) <hi>A Learned and Godly Ministry.</hi> (5.) <hi>A Sanctifying the Sabbath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Good Order in Families.</hi> Heads of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, ſhould inſtruct their young ones in Holy Scripture Truths and Precepts; <hi>diligently teach</hi> them <hi>God's Law,</hi> (Deut. 6.6, 7.) and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> them to <hi>keep the way of the Lord,</hi> Gen. 18.19. They ſhould <hi>bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> (Eph. 6, 4.) <hi>Train</hi> them up in thoſe ways of vertue they ought to walk in as long as they live, tho they ſhould live to be <hi>Old,</hi> Prov. 22.6. They ſhould bring them up religiouſly, vertuouſly, diligently;
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001861_0016_0FB91F0914F80EA8"/>
govern them well, keep them under proper reſtraints and diſcipline. Children ſhould not be left ro their own giddy unbridled humours, but ſhould be under <hi>Tutors</hi> and <hi>Governours,</hi> (Gal. 4.I, 2.) for they need a <hi>Guide for their Youth.</hi> Children ſhould be brought up, not <hi>Idly,</hi> but <hi>Diligently.</hi> 
               <q>Twas once a Law in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> &amp; afterwards in <hi>Athens</hi>: that every Man ſhould once a Year give a Satisfactory Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, what Courſe he took for a livelihood, elſe he ſhould be put to Death</q>. This ſhows how neceſſary they thought <hi>Induſtry</hi> and <hi>Diligence</hi> were, for the good of the Publick. And further, <hi>Family Prayer</hi> ſhould be conſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening</hi> in our Houſes. Heads of Families ſhould reſolve like <hi>Joſhua, As for me and my houſe we will ſerve the Lord,</hi> Joſh. 24.15.</p>
            <p>Theſe things in their place and order, tend as directly as any thing can do, to promote good knowlege and holy obedience in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing People. And on the other hand, the neglect of Family Inſtruction, Religion and Government, tends directly to introduce in a ſhourt time, an <hi>overflowing deluge of Ignorance, Wickedneſs,</hi> and <hi>waſting Judgments.</hi>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (beſides family Inſtruction but now hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at) <hi>Schools</hi> for the Inſtructing of Children in <hi>Reading</hi> (that they may <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> the only rule of Faith &amp; Life) <hi>Writing, Cyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> are very needful to promote a Peoples <hi>well doing</hi> &amp; <hi>well being. Grammar Schools</hi> alſo, for the fitting and training up Perſons for the <hi>Colledge,</hi> are very needful to promote <hi>Knowledge</hi> and holy <hi>Obedience</hi> among a proſeſſing People. It ſeems needleſs ſo much as to <hi>Eſſay a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi> of theſe things. Any one that ſeriouſly conſiders the State of a People, that the grown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up Generation are dying and droping off; and that the Children growing up, muſt ſoon bear all the ſway and influence in all Publick Affairs, I ſay, any one that ſeriouſly weighs theſe matters, can't but ſee, That <hi>Good Order in Families,</hi> and <hi>Schools</hi> for the <hi>well Educating of Children,</hi> are unſpeakably uſeful and needful for a Peoples welfare. Every Child that grows up will be a <hi>uſeful</hi> or <hi>hurtful</hi> Member of the body Politick. And perſons thus growing up, are moſt likely to prove <hi>uſeful</hi> or <hi>hurtful,</hi> according to the good or bad Methods taken in their Education. Thoſe well <hi>Inſtructed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, Imployed</hi> in their Youth; are moſt likely to be <hi>harmleſs and ſericeable</hi> in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Thoſe brought up in <hi>Ignorance</hi> &amp; <hi>Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Pride</hi> and <hi>Luxury</hi>; are likely to prove Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious themſelves, and to be <hi>Perſonous, Infectious Plagues</hi> to the Publick.

Thoſe who thro' coveteouſneſs or, bruitiſh careleſsneſs, are unwilling ta Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <hi>Schools</hi> &amp; the well Educating of Children; ſeem really to be Enemies to Chriſt's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and friends to the kingdom of darkneſs and wickedneſs. Since the well Educating of Children, tends ſo much and ſo directly to a Peoples <hi>well doing</hi> and <hi>well being,</hi> ſurely thoſe in Authority ſhould by all proper Methods Incourage it. And whether Authority, beſides providing proper Laws for the Incouragement of <hi>Schools,</hi> ſhould not alſo appoint <hi>Inſpectors,</hi> to ſee whether Children hare ſuch Education as tends to render them Pious &amp; Uſeful Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body Politick; is a thing (as I humbly concieve) not unworthy of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Colledge.</hi> Our Fathers ſhewed great regard to the Glory of God, to the Spiritual and Temporal good of their Poſterity in early <hi>Founding a Colledge</hi> in this Wilderneſs, to Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate &amp; qualify Perſons (ſo far as ſuch Indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours can do it) for ſpecial &amp; eminent Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Services both in Church and State.

Agreably to theſe good purpoſes, God has been pleaſed to make this Nurſery even from the beginnings of it hitherto, a great bleſſing to this <hi>Province</hi> and to the Neighbouring <hi>Colonies.</hi> Yea, Streams from this River, have alſo made glad other parts of the City of God. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our <hi>cold Climate, ſevere Winters,</hi> and <hi>hard Labour</hi> for a livelihood; yet I reckon our <hi>Colledge</hi> has been a greater bleſſing, a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching Fund and Treaſure to us, than all the <hi>Gold and Silver Mines</hi> of the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt Indies,</hi> have been to thoſe that poſſeſs'd them. May God long continue the <hi>Colledge,</hi> and make it a greater bleſſing than ever to His People.

            <p n="5">5. <hi>A Sanctifying the Sabbath.</hi> God expreſly ſays, Exod. 20. 8. <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.</hi> So to improve the <hi>Sabbath</hi> as God directs, is it ſelf one evident part or inſtance of holineſs, and it greatly tends to promote holineſs in other regards too. It has been long ſince remark'd, that Religion commonly thrives or decays among a People, according as the Sabbath, the Lords Day, is ſtrictly Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved &amp; Sanctifyed, or baſely neglected and profaned. To keep holy the Lords Day, and to take all proper meaſures to prevent the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation of it, tends much to promote the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs &amp; happineſs of a proſeſſing People. For the divine Oracles plainly teſtifie, That a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are expos'd to heavy Judgment, by abuſing and proſaning Gods holy day.

It's well known, that <hi>the main deſign of our Fathers coming into this Wilderneſs was, that they might peaceably and quietly Worſhip God, and manage the affairs of His Houſe,</hi> (as to <hi>Particular Churches, Councils, Synods,</hi>) <hi>according to their beſt underſtanding of the Rules of His Word</hi> (<hi>without humane Inventions and Impoſitions</hi>) <hi>and that their Poſterity might do ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them</hi>: and I verily believe, that the more cloſely we adhere to the plain Rules of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in theſe things, ſo much the more God will bleſs us; &amp; that the more we deviate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, ſo much the more God will depart from us. And here, whether on ſome General Yearly <hi>Faſt</hi> or <hi>Thankſgiving,</hi> a General <hi>Contribution</hi> thro' the Province, to promote the Goſpel, in <hi>Small, Poor</hi> or <hi>Deſtitute</hi> Places, would not be for the glory of God, for the honour and furtherance of our holy Religion, I humbly ſubmit to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Conſideration. And will yet ſay, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ſo Collected, wiſely Imploy'd, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Accounted for, would be no burthen on voluntary Contributors, but might probably do abundance of good.</p>

Indeed the more thro'ly acquainted they are with all the Circumſtances of their People; ſo much the more eaſily they may obſerve, what would be for their Publick and General Advantage or Diſadvantage.

And the beſt way to do this, is by

a religious, ſober, vertuous life; by ſhewing great and ſteady prudence, zeal, juſtice, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, and vigorous Application in the work of thoſe Stations they're fixed in. To keep a ſtrait rein, and a ſteady moderate pace, is the likelieſt method to avoid ſtumbling and to bring the Traveller ſeaſonably to his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's end.

at ſhould be, to get <hi>ſuch Perſons</hi> into thoſe Poſts of Stations that are to be fill'd up. It's dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to put Power into the hands of vicious Perſons.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Good Rulers among a Profeſſing People, are a great Bleſſing to them.</hi> To have Perſons of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity &amp; Skilfulneſs, Feeding &amp; Guiding</hi> of them; muſt needs be much for their advantage. <hi>When the righteous are in Authority, the people rejoyce: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn,</hi> Prov. 29.2.

Yea the <hi>Sins of a People,</hi> may provoke God to leave their Rulers to take ſuch unhappy ſteps. <hi>The Anger of the Lord was kindled againſt Iſrael, &amp; he moved David a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, to ſay, go number Iſrael &amp; Judah,</hi> 2 Sam. 24.I. Seeing theſe things are ſo, ſurely People ſhould make Conſcience of Praying for their Rulers, that God would not leave them to any wrong ſteps or manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but that He would fill them with Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Courage, Conduct, with <hi>Skilfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> with great ſteadineſs of Mind; and that He would help them rightly to imploy their betruſted Powers; that He would Bleſs them, and make them great Bleſſings to their People. If there were leſs Reviling of, &amp; more ſervent Praying for, Rulers; 'twould often be much better for a People. 1 Tim. 2.1, 2. <hi>I will therefore that firſt of all, Supplications, Prayers, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions &amp; giving of thanks be made for all men:

for Kings, and for all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet &amp; peaceable life, in all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as People ſhould make Conſcience of Praying for their Rulers, ſo, which is another Inference,</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>They ſhould make it their chief care to pleaſe and obey God, that He may always favour them with good Rulers.</hi> Such Rulers are truly a great Bleſſing, and none but God (<hi>the giver of every good Gift</hi> Jam. 1.17.) can beſtow or continue ſuch a Bleſſing. 'Tis God alone who can <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie</hi> and <hi>

                  </gap>ſſiſt</hi> Perſons to Rule well; or in His Providence veſt them with <hi>Authority</hi> therefor. It is by Him <hi>that Kings reign &amp; Princes decree juſtice,</hi> Prov, 8.15. <hi>Promotion comes not from the Eaſt, Weſt or South; but God is Judge, he puts down one &amp; ſets up another,</hi> Pſal, 75.6, 7. <hi>The Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water; he turneth it whither ſoever he will,</hi> Prov. 21.1. <hi>He changeth the times &amp; ſeaſons: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth Kings, &amp; ſetteth up Kings: he giveth wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the wiſe, &amp; knowledge to them that know underſtanding,</hi> Dan. 2.21. Indeed 'tis with God in His Sovereign Providence, to bring whom He will into Authority and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; He alſo can cauſe the Wiſdom of the Wiſe to periſh, and make them grope at noon day as in the dark; or He, can give Wiſdom

and Grace for the right diſcharge of incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent Duties. Surely then, if People would injoy the great Bleſſing of good Rulers, they ſhould ſtrenuouſly indeavour to obey &amp; pleaſe God, who alone can favour them with ſo rich a Mercy. Whatever Rulers are whether good or bad; yet if the People generally are ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, diſobedient, rebellious againſt God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reclaimable in ways of Wickedneſs; they may then expect deſtroying deſolating Judgments from God. Tho' <hi>Noah, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> were among them; they could not deliver or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14, 20. If they had <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> to Govern them; yet if they obſtinately tranſgreſs; they may expect <hi>that God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal his wrath from Heaven, againſt their ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and unrighteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 1.18. The Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to Iſrael, 1 Sam. 12.25. <hi>If ye ſhall ſtill do wickedly, ye ſhall be conſumed, both ye and your King.</hi> Therefore let this whole People be Exhorted, to fear God &amp; keep His Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; this is the beſt Method they can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly take for their own Welfare on all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.

Then ſurely, our whole Nation ſhould hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily Bleſs and Praiſe God, in that He did ſo <hi>Seaſonably, Wonderfully, Mercifully</hi> place our Soveraign Lord KING GEORGE on the <hi>Britiſh Throne</hi>; A Prince of ſuch Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior.
