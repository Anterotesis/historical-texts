            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S your Excellency, together with the members of his Majeſty's honourable council, and houſe of repreſentatives, were pleaſed at my late viſit to the Orphan-houſe, not only highly to approve of, but alſo deeply to intereſt yourſelves in, the deſign of converting the preſent Georgia Orphan-houſe into a college; ſo I am perſuaded, you make no doubt, but that ever ſince my arrival in England, in July 1765, I have exerted my utmoſt efforts in endeavouring to bring this important affair to a deſirable iſſue. To
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010803_0003_0F81D635746ECE48"/>
mention all the various circumſtances which have occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red during that interval, to impede and retard its more ſpeedy proſecution, would be tedious and unneceſſary: I would therefore only inform your Excellency, that about fifteen months ago, a memorial was delivered into the hands of the late clerk of his Majeſty's moſt honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able privy council. That this memorial was by him tranſmitted to the Lord Preſident, and by his Lordſhip referred to the conſideration of his Grace the Archbiſhop of Canterbury; that by his Grace's permiſſion a literary correſpondence enſued; but as that correſpondence, and with that, the negotiation itſelf ſeems at an end, I think it my duty, not only to lay an account of the whole before your Excellency in particular; but, through your Excellency's hands; before his Majeſty's council and houſe of repreſentatives of the colony of Georgia, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the other American Coloniſts, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in general, on both ſides the water, who have ſo liberally contributed to the promoting this deſign.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Sheweth,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THAT about twenty-ſix years ago, your memoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, aſſiſted by the voluntary contributions of charitable and well diſpoſed perſons, at a very great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and under many diſadvantages, did erect a very commodious houſe with neceſſary out-buildings, ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the reception of orphans and other poor and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted children; and that with the repair of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, purchaſe of negroes, and ſupporting a large orphan family ſo many years, he hath expended upwards of twelve thouſand pounds ſterling, as appears by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, which from time to time have been audited by the magiſtrates of Savannah, and which are humbly preſented with this memorial.</p>
            <p>That your Memorialiſt, ſince the commencement of this inſtitution, hath had the ſatisfaction of finding, that by the money expended thereon, not only many poor families were aſſiſted and thereby kept from leaving the colony in its infant ſtate; but alſo that a conſiderable number of poor helpleſs children have been trained up, who have been, and are now uſeful ſettlers in that and the other neighbouring provinces; that in order to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the inſtitution aforeſaid more extenſively uſeful, your Memorialiſt, as he perceived the colony gradually riſing,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010803_0004_0F81D6362E65C308"/>
hath for ſome years paſt deſigned, within himſelf, to improve the original plan, by making further proviſion for the education of perſons of ſuperiour rank, who thereby may be qualified to ſerve their king, their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and their God, either in church or ſtate.</p>
            <p>That in his late viſit to Georgia, he did with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible pleaſure ſee the province in a very flouriſhing ſtate; but with concern perceived that ſeveral gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had been obliged to ſend their ſons to the Northern Provinces, who would much rather have had them edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated nearer home; and thereby prevent their affections being alienated from their native country, and alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſums of money from being carried out of Georgia into other provinces.</p>
            <p>Your Memorialiſt begs leave further to obſerve, that there is no Seminary for Academical Studies as yet founded ſouthward of Virginia; and conſequently if a college could be eſtabliſhed (eſpecially as the addition of the two Floridas renders Georgia more centrical for the ſouthern diſtrict) it would not only be highly ſerviceable to the riſing generation of the colony of Georgia, but would probably occaſion many youths to be ſent from the neighbouring ſouthern provinces for education. The many advantages accruing to Georgia thereby muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be very conſiderable.</p>
            <p>That in conſideration of the foregoing premiſes, your Memorialiſt in December 1764, preſented a memorial to his excellency the Governour and the honourable the council of the province of Georgia, praying that two thouſand acres of land might be granted in truſt towards carrying on the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rable end of founding a college; which motion was not only immediately complied with, but the general aſſembly being then ſitting, an addreſs, a copy of which is herewith alſo ſent, was preſented from them to his Excellency, expreſſing their unanimous and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010803_0004_0F81D6362E65C308"/>
higheſt approbation, with a deſire that his Excellency would uſe his endeavours to have this affair forwarded at home with all poſſible expedition. That upon the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of your Memorialiſt, he was informed that this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs was remitted to, and laid before the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for trade and plantations; having received re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated advices that numbers both in Georgia and South-Carolina are waiting with impatience to have their ſons initiated in academical exerciſes, Your Memorialiſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prays that a charter upon the plan of New-Jerſey College may be granted, upon which your Memorialiſt is ready to give up his preſent truſt and make a free gift of all lands, negroes, goods and chattels, which he now ſtands poſſeſſed of in the province of Georgia, for the preſent founding, and towards the future ſupport, of a college, to be called by the name of Betheſda College in the province of Georgia.</p>

            <p>I THINK myſelf highly honoured in the Lord Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent's<note n="*" place="bottom">Earl of Northington.</note> referring a late memorial to your Grace's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; and as highly obliged to your Grace, for the deep attention your Grace hath given to the copy of an intended charter preſented to your Grace by the Earl of Dartmouth.—The incloſed will ſhew what an almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite regard hath been paid to your Grace's wiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks and judicious corrections.—I wiſh it could have been altogether implicite—But circumſtances are ſuch (as hath been hinted to your Grace by Lord Dartmouth) that I cannot in honour and conſcience <hi>oblige</hi> the maſter
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010803_0005_0F81D63667120F58"/>
of the Georgia College to be a member or miniſter of the church of England. Such an obligation, I am perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hath greatly retarded the progreſs of the college of New-York; as on the contrary, the letter ſigned by your Grace, Proprietor Penn, and the late Dr. Chandler, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging, that that inſtitution ſhall be continued on a BROAD BOTTOM, hath as much promoted the growth of the college of Philadelphia.—The truſtees of that ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary (as your Grace is pleaſed to obſerve) have agreed, "That their provoſt ſhall always be a miniſter of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed church."—But then I would beg leave to reply, that they are not thereto <hi>enjoined</hi> by their charter. That is entirely ſilent concerning this matter—Their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is purely voluntary.—The wardens of the college of Georgia will not be prohibited by charter from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the example of the truſtees of the college of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia—It is more than probable they will never need it. The firſt maſter will aſſuredly be a clergyman of the church of England.—By far the majority of the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wardens are, and always will be, members of that communion; and conſequently the choice of a maſter will always continue to run in that channel—My heart's deſire is, that ſome worthy duly qualified miniſter of the church of England may be always and readily found for that grand purpoſe. But leſt this ſhould not always be the caſe, I dare not, as perſons of all denominations have been contributors, confine or fetter the future electors. The monies gained by the New-York lotteries, for the erecting a college in New-York; were thrown in by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all religious perſwaſions, in confidence, that the college would hereafter be founded on an enlarged baſis. And therefore, very great numbers, may it pleaſe your Grace, think, and forever will think, themſelves injured by its being confined within its preſent contracted bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary. Hence it is, that many fine promiſing youths are
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010803_0005_0F81D63667120F58"/>
almoſt daily ſent from the college in their native city to that of New-Jerſey—I dread giving the ſame occaſion of reſentment and offence—And therefore am determined to avoid it in the wording of the Georgia College charter—For the ſame reaſons I dare not enjoin the daily uſe of our church liturgy. I love to uſe it, I have fallen a martyr, in reſpect to bodily health, to the frequent read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in Tottenham-Court chapel; and it has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly read twice every ſunday in the Orphan-houſe, from its firſt inſtitution to this very day—The wardens, when the power is devolved on them, may determine this point as they pleaſe—But I cannot enjoin it by charter—And have therefore, in this preſent draught, not only omitted the paragraph concerning publick prayer, but alſo that concerning doctrinal articles. Perhaps your Grace may judge, that all things conſidered, ſaying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about either, may be a proper medium—Your Grace further wiſely obſerves, That his Majeſty ſhould be very well adviſed whom he names for the firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.—I truſt he will. I believe the Right Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the Earl of Dartmouth will vouchſafe to intereſt himſelf in the choice, and likewiſe be ſo good as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the firſt maſter to your Grace's approbation—The terms of the charter being not as yet ſettled, the choice of a maſter cannot as yet be fixed upon. When the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are aſcertained, the latter may more eaſily be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied for—In the mean while your Grace may be aſſured that the lot will not fall upon me. Alas! my ſhoulders are too weak for the ſupport of ſuch an academical bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: my capacity, may it pleaſe your Grace, is by no means extenſive enough for ſuch a ſcholaſtick truſt—To be a preſbyter at large, is the ſtation which, I think, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence hath called me to for near theſe thirty years laſt paſt—During that ſpace, I truſt my eye hath been in ſome degree ſingle, and my views diſintereſted:

and my higheſt, my only ambition, during the feeble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of my future pilgrimage, I truſt will be this, viz. That the laſt glimmerings of an expiring taper may be bleſſed, and owned by the great Shepherd and Biſhop of ſouls, to guide ſome wandering ſinners to the practical knowledge of himſelf. I deſire to bleſs his name, that I have been ſpared long enough to ſee the colony of the once deſpiſed Georgia, and the yet more deſpiſed Orphan-houſe, advanced to ſuch a promiſing height. My ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured friend, and father, good Biſhop Benſon, from his dying bed, ſent me a benefaction for it of ten guineas, and poured forth his moſt fervent dying breathings for its future proſperity.—That your Grace may yet live many years, to be happily inſtrumental in promoting its welfare, both ſpiritual and temporal, when turned into a college, is the earneſt prayer of</p>

            <p>MY obligations are much increaſed by your Grace's putting the laſt draught of the Georgia College ſo ſpeedily into the hands of the Lord Preſident.—As by this, (I preſume) it hath been honoured by your Grace's, ſo I make no manner of doubt, but it will alſo meet with his Lordſhip's approbation. In obedience to your Grace's deſire, I herewith ſend your Grace an account of what preſent endowment, "and to what value, I propoſe for the intended College."—Upon a moderate computation, may it pleaſe your Grace, I believe its preſent annual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come is between four and five hundred pounds ſterling. The houſe is ſurrounded with eighteen hundred acres of land; a plan of which, and likewiſe of the houſe itſelf, I herein incloſe, and humbly preſent for your Grace's pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal. The number of negroes, young and old, employed on various parts of theſe lands, in ſawing timber, raiſing rice for exportation, and corn, with all other kinds of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the family, is about thirty.—Beſides theſe, the College will be immediately poſſeſſed of two thouſand acres of land near Alatamaha, which were granted me by the Governour and Council when I was laſt at Georgia, and a thouſand acres more, left, as I am informed, by the late Reverend and worthy Mr. Zouber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uhler.—So that, by laying out only a thouſand pounds in purchaſing an additional number of negroes, and allowing another thouſand fot repairing the houſe, and building the two intended wings, the preſent annual income may very eaſily and ſpeedily be augmented to a thouſand pounds <hi>per annum.</hi> Out of this ſtanding fund may be paid the ſalaries of the maſter, profeſſors, tutors, &amp;c. and alſo ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

be allowed for ſome orphan or other poor ſtudents, who may have their tutorage and room-rent gratis, and act as ſervitors to thoſe who enter commoners. What theſe ſalaries and exhibitions ought to be, may at a proper ſeaſon be ſubmitted to your Grace's future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.—At preſent I would only further propoſe, that the negro children belonging to the College ſhall be inſtructed, in their intervals of labour, by one of the poorer ſtudents, as is done now by one of the ſcholars in the preſent Orphan-houſe. And I do not ſee why an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional proviſion may not likewiſe be made for educating and maintaining a number of Indian children, which, I imagine, may eaſily be procured from the Creeks, Choc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taws, Cherokees, and the other neighbouring nations. Hence the whole will be a free gift to the colony of Georgia—a complex extenſive charity be eſtabliſhed; and, at the ſame time, not a ſingle perſon obliged, by any publick act of aſſembly, to pay an involuntary forced tax towards the ſupport of a ſeminary from which many of the more diſtant and poorer Coloniſts children cannot poſſibly receive any immediate advantage, and yet the whole colony, by the chriſtian and liberal education of a great number of its individuals, be univerſally benefited. Thus have I moſt readily, and I humbly hope, gratefully complied with your Grace's deſire, which to me is as a command. I am conſtrained to treſpaſs on your Grace's patience, whilſt I congratulate your Grace on the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, who, amongſt many other ſignal marks of his peculiar providence, hath honoured your Grace, in making you an happy inſtrument of eſtabliſhing two Northern American Colleges, the one at New-York, and the other at Philadelphia: And if (as I pray may be the caſe) your Grace ſhould yet be made further inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in eſtabliſhing a third College in the yet more Southern diſtant, but now flouriſhing, Colony of Georgia, I truſt
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010803_0007_0F81D637E9365AA0"/>
it will be an additional gem in the crown, which I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly pray that God, the righteous Judge, may give your Grace in that day.—In his great name, I beg leave to ſubſcribe myſelf,</p>

            <p>AFTER earneſt application to the Father of mercies for directions, I have endeavoured, as in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, duly to conſider and weigh the contents of the Lord Preſident's letter, which your Grace was ſo condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as to tranſmit for my peruſal. His lordſhip therein is pleaſed to inform your Grace, That he obſerves, that the ſecond draught of Mr. Whitefield's charter differs from that of New-York, in not requiring the head of the College to be a member of the church of England, which his Lordſhip thinks ſo material a qualification, that for one, he ſhould not be for diſpenſing with it. And his Lordſhip is alſo of opinion, that the publick prayers ſhould not be extempore ones, but the liturgy of the church, or ſome part thereof, or ſome other ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled and eſtabliſhed form. Thus far his Lordſhip. And as I profeſs myſelf to be a preſby<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er of the ſame communion with his Lordſhip, I cannot but applaud his Lordſhip's zeal for, and watchfulneſs over, the honour of the eſtabliſhed church—But if his Lordſhip would be ſo good as to take a particular view of the point of light in which I ſtand, I cannot help flattering myſelf that his Lordſhip will be ſo far from thinking, that being a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the church of England is a qualification not to be diſpenſed with in the head of the intended College, that, on the contrary, it ought not ſo much as to be mentioned, or inſiſted upon, in the charter at all—For, not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your Grace with a repetition of the reaſons urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch a reſtraining clauſe, in my letter of June 17th, I would beg leave further to obſerve to your Grace, that

This being the caſe, may it pleaſe your Grace, I would humbly appeal to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, whether I can anſwer it to my God, my conſcience, my King, my country, my conſtituents, and Orphan-houſe benefactors and contributors, both at home and abroad, to betray my truſt, forfeit my word, act contrary to my own convictions, and greatly retard and prejudice the growth and progreſs of the intended inſtitution, by narrowing its foundation, and thereby letting it fall upon ſuch a bottom, as I am perſuaded will give a general diſguſt, and moſt juſtly open the mouths of perſons of all denominations againſt me.—This, as I acquainted your Grace, in the ſame letter referred to above, is what I dare
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010803_0009_0F81D63C58455548"/>
not do—And therefore, as your Grace by your ſilence ſeems to be like minded with the Lord Preſident, and as your Grace's and his Lordſhip's influence will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly extend itſelf to others of his Majeſty's moſt honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able privy council, I would beg leave, after returning all due acknowledgments, to inform your Grace, that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend troubling your Grace or his Lordſhip no more about this ſo long depending concern—As it hath pleaſed the great head of the church in ſome degree to renew my bodily ſtrength, I purpoſe now to renew my feeble ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and turn the charity into a more generous, and conſequently into a more extenſively uſeful channel.—If I know any thing of my own heart, I have no ambition to be looked upon at preſent, or remembered for the future, as a founder of a College—But I would fain, may it pleaſe your Grace, act the part of an honeſt man, a diſintereſted miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, and a truly catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick moderate preſbyter of the church of England—In this way, and in this only, can I hope for a continued heart-felt enjoyment of that peace of God, which paſſeth all underſtanding, whilſt here on earth, and be thereby prepared to ſtand with humble boldneſs before the awful, impartial tribunal of the great Shepherd and Biſhop of ſouls in heaven.—That your Grace may ſhine as a ſtar of the firſt magnitude in that day, is the ſincere prayer of,</p>

               <p>THAT about twenty-five years ago, your Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſt, aſſiſted by the voluntary contributions of charitable and well-diſpoſed perſons, at a very great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and under many diſadvantages, did erect a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious houſe, with neceſſary out-buildings, ſuitable for the reception of orphans, and other poor and deſerted children; and that with the repair of the buildings, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of negroes, and ſupporting a large ophan family for ſo many years, he hath expended upwards of twelve thouſand pounds ſterling, as appears by the accounts,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010803_0012_0F81D63EA59834E0"/>
which from time to time have been audited by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of Savannah.</p>
               <p>That your Memorialiſt, ſince the commencement of this inſtitution, hath had the ſatisfaction of finding that by the money expended thereon, not only many poor families were aſſiſted, and thereby kept from leaving the colony in its infant ſtate, but alſo that a conſiderable number of poor helpleſs children have been trained up; who have been, and now are uſeful ſettlers in this and the other neighbouring provinces.</p>
               <p>That in order to render the inſtitution aforeſaid more extenſively uſeful, your Memorialiſt, as he perceived the colony gradually increaſing, hath for ſome years paſt deſigned within himſelf, to improve the original plan, by making further proviſion for the education of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſuperiour rank; who thereby might be qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſerve their king, their country, or their God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in church or ſtate.—That he doth with inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pleaſure ſee the preſent very flouriſhing ſtate of the province; but with concern perceives that ſeveral gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen have been obliged to ſend their ſons to the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern provinces; who would much rather have had them educated nearer home, and thereby prevent their affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions being alienated from their native country, and alſo conſiderable ſums of money from being carried out of this into other provinces.</p>
               <p>Your Memorialiſt further obſerves, that there is no Seminary for Academical Studies as yet founded ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Virginia; and conſequently if a college could be eſtabliſhed here (eſpecially as the late addition of the two Floridas renders Georgia more centrical for the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010803_0013_0F81D6406B348430"/>
ſouthern diſtrict) it would not only be highly ſerviceable to the riſing generation of this colony, but would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably occaſion many youths to be ſent from the Britiſh Weſt-India Iſlands and other parts—The many advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages accruing thereby to this province muſt be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.</p>
               <p>From theſe conſiderations, your Memorialiſt is induced to believe, that the time is now approaching, when his long projected deſign for further ſerving this his beloved colony ſhall be carried into execution.</p>
               <p>That a conſiderable sum of money is intended ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be laid out in purchaſing a large number of negroes for the further cultivation of the preſent Orphan houſe and other additional lands, and for the future ſupport of a worthy able preſident, profeſſors, and tutors, and other good purpoſes intended.</p>
               <p>Your Memorialiſt therefore prays your Excellency and Honours to great to him in truſt, for the purpoſes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, two thouſand acres of land, on the north fork of Turtle River, called the Leſſer Swamp, if vacant, or where lands may be found vacant, ſouth of the river Alatamaha.</p>
