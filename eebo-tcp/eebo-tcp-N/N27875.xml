            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ATTEND, ye young men, who are about to enter into trade, for to you I write my ſtory. I was bound appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to a reſpectable tradeſman in Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. My maſter, Mr. Vincent, had acquired a very fair character, whilſt he was making a comfortable fortune. His wife was a dreſſy, flaſhy woman, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked viſiting and jaunting more than ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care of her family; whilſt my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was plodding late at night in the compting-houſe, Mrs. Vincent and her daughters were either making parties abroad, or giving entertainments at home. As we kept no footman. I was allowed, when ſhop was ſhut, to run from one pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic place to another to call a coach, to bring Mrs. Vincent and her daughters home. To lounging about the perleus of a Playhouſe I owe my ruin. I was generally allowed to be a handſome, well-made young man; this unfortunately
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:037140_0003_100C836A449FC2F8"/>
drew upon me the notice of a ſet of thoſe wretched women, who nightly crowd the Theatres; I ſhould have been delighted with the notice they took of me, had not my vanity whiſpered me that Miſs Vincent was in love with me. This ſuſpicion was fully confirmed to me by one Potter, an elder apprentice, but for whoſe wicked advice, I might have lived happily, and died virtuouſly.</p>
            <p>The idea that Miſs Vincent was in love with me, at once compleated me for the coxcomb; I now neglected my buſineſs, and to dreſs out my perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the only object of my thoughts; I began to commit little frauds on my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in order to obtain money to dreſs out; for, ever ſince Potter had laughed me out of my religion, every principle of moral honeſty fat looſely upon me.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry to ſay, the holy Sabbath in our family was only diſtinguiſhed from other days by the ſhutting of the ſhop; my maſter ſpent the greater part of it poſting his books, and my miſtreſs and her daughters were either dreſſing to go abroad, or elſe to receive company at
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037140_0004_100C93EEE19492A8"/>
home. We young men, indeed, were ſent to church, but as we had no exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſet us by the heads of the family going thither themſelves, Potter and I generally hired a gig, and daſhed away from one tea-drinking place to another; theſe ſcenes ſoon made me loſe all reſpect for Virtue and Religion. It was at the Dog and Duck I firſt ſaw the infamous Miſs Weſt; ſhe was many years older than myſelf, her perſon was as lovely as her heart was wicked. She was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er informed that I was to come into poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of 3000l. the day I came of age, than ſhe made uſe of all her deceitful arts to enſnare both my ſoul and body, as ſhe often prompted me to defraud my maſter to ſupply her extravagance. My attachment to Miſs Vincent was now on the decline, for Miſs Weſt had ſo far wrought upon my vanity, as to make me believe that ſo handſome a young fellow as I was, ſhould look higher than a tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's daughter. From that moment I treated Miſs Vincent with the moſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked neglect, although I ſaw my conduct cut her to the heart; yet, at the ſame time I was baſe enough to borrow money
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037140_0005_100C93F1038E6298"/>
of her, which I wantonly ſquandered away on Miſs Weſt.</p>
            <p>When Potter's apprenticeſhip expired, inſtead of improving his fortune by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into trade, he plunged at once into all the vices of the Town. He poſſeſſed a plauſible kind of prate, which cauſed him to be appointed Chairman to our Club, which was chiefly compoſed of clerks and apprentice boys. Potter's principal excellence conſiſted in ſinging a merry ſong, telling an indecent ſtory, and teaching his hearers to laugh at mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and ſet all religion at defiance, for religion he maintained, was only an old woman's tale, invented, by cunning heads to keep children and fools in order.</p>
            <p>There was an honeſt old Porter lived in our family, who for ſome time had ſet himſelf to watch my conduct, and at length he made ſuch a faithful report of it to my maſter, that he gave up my inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and turned, me out of doors.</p>
            <p>I was too much delighted with my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to feel the leaſt ſenſe of ſhame at the means by which I obtained it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:037140_0006_100C93F3AA0EBD28"/>
I was ſorry, however, to break off en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely with Miſs Vincent, for I ſtill had a lurking affection for her; I told Potter ſo; his inventive genius ſoon laid a plan whereby I might get her into my power, and take a compleat revenge on her whole family at the ſame time. This was by writing her a letter, ſetting forth the violence of my love, the unmerited diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace I had received from her family, and at the ſame time requeſting her to grant me a private meeting, in order that I might juſtify my conduct to her, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I feared the violence of my paſſion would drive me to a fit of deſpair.</p>
            <p>This poor imprudent girl met me at the time, and place appointed. I will not here ſhock my readers with relating the vile ſtratagems I made uſe of to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the ruin of this young lady, nor the tremendous oaths I ſwore to repair her wrongs by marriage, as ſoon as I came of age, which would be in a very few months; this ſomewhat abated her ſorrow for the the very indiſcreet ſtep ſhe had taken.</p>
            <p>The day I became of age, I went down into the country. My friends having
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037140_0007_100C93F537BE8200"/>
been apprized of my profligate life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me very coldly. I practiſed the deepeſt hypocricy on my good mother, to make her believe I was quite a reformed man, in order to wheedle her out of a ſum of money, telling her at the ſame time, I had an immediate proſpect of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into a very profitable concern with a partner of great reſponſibility, if I could but increaſe my capital.</p>
            <p>"Frank," ſaid ſhe, with firmneſs, "there is no truſting to your promiſes; as long as your conduct deſerved my love, you ever found me an indulgent mother, but you ſhall never have cauſe to ſay, I acted towards you like a weak woman, by robbing my virtuous children, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the wanton extravagance of a profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate ſon. Your wicked life, Frank, has nearly broken my heart, but it ſhall not ſhake my juſtice." The well known ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of my mother's temper convinced me at once ſhe was not further to be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon by the fallacy of my arguments.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I had ſettled my buſineſs, I returned to London to Miſs Vincent, who had waited for me with the utmoſt
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037140_0008_100C93F6C68DB818"/>
patience, fully expecting I was come to fulfil my promiſe of marriage to her "I can ſtruggle with want, dear Frank," ſaid ſhe, "but I will never conſent to live in ſhame."</p>
            <p>Nothing I am certain hardens the heart like vice, for although this poor young creature was brought into a very trying ſituation by the proſpect of ſoon becoming a mother, I ſwore I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make <hi>her</hi> my <hi>wife,</hi> who had diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced herſelf by living with me as a <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress.</hi> On hearing this, in all the tender agonies of grief, ſhe urged me to repair the wrongs I had done her, reminding me at the ſame time of the wicked arts I had made uſe of to beguile her of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, and then, with claſped hands and ſtreaming eyes, ſhe threw herſelf on her knees before me, beſeeching me to pity the agonies which rent her ſoul, yet my hardened nature was untouched by her ſorrow, again I ſolemnly ſwore I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would marry her.</p>
            <p>Through exceſs of grief ſhe ſainted away, in which pitiable ſtate I left her to the care of a ſervant, went out and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037140_0009_100C93F90CD9FE48"/>
ſpent the reſt of the evening with Miſs Weſt, whoſe flinty heart turned into ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule the ſorrowful tale I related to her.</p>
            <p>On returning to my lodgings the next morning, I was informed Miſs Vincent had left them without leaving behind her the leaſt information where ſhe was to be found, and much did I rejoice when I heard it, that ſhe had taken herſelf off ſo quietly.</p>
            <p>I now laviſhed my money as though it would never have an end. By all I was eſteemed the moſt noble ſpirited fellow in the world, and even little wits would be ſilent in my preſence, becauſe I was ſure to pay for the wine upon which they were to riot. My caſh at length beginning to run low, as I had been all along drawing from the principal, I adviſed with Potter how to get furniſhed with future ſupplies. He adviſed the gaming table as a never-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ailing friend, ſaying it had long ſince been the only reſource from whence he derived his ſubſiſtence.</p>
            <p>I took his advice, and for ſome months was ſo ſucceſsful, that I began to daſh
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037140_0010_100C93FAF75613A0"/>
away in higher life at the Weſt end of the Town. I bought an elegant phaeton which I drove every Sunday in Hyde Park, with Miſs Weſt by my ſide. One day as I was driving furiouſly through Temple Bar, I had the misfortune to overturn a poor man with a heavy load on his back, and on his getting up I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him to be Mr. Vincent's old por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to whom I formerly owed my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</p>
            <p>"Ah! ah! what is it you, young hopeful?" cried he, on ſeeing to whom he owed his misfortune, "well, he muſt needs go whom the devil drives; thy prancing nags may die a natural death, maſter Frank, but verily, I think 'tis more than thou wilt, boy, for if thou dieſt in thy ſhoes, the gallows will be robbed of it's due. What is become of poor Patty Vincent, thou profligate dog, haſt thou broken her heart, as thou haſt that of her poor afflicted parents?"</p>
            <p>The ſudden recollection of that unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate girl cauſed ſuch a ſwimming in my heed, that the reins dropt from my hands, my horſes took fright, and it was almoſt
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037140_0011_100C93FCE80DC4D8"/>
a miracle that I got home alive. The porter's words had made ſuch an impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on my mind, that I could not ſhake them off. Soon after Potter calling in upon me, I told him of my interview with the old porter, and alſo the effect it had on me. "Frank," ſaid he, if a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of thy ſpirit can be thus eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by qualms of conſcience, let us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly adjourn to the tavern, ſince good wine is the beſt remedy in the world to drown all uneaſy recollections in." I gladly accepted his propoſal, we called a coach, and off we went. He no ſooner ſaw my ſpirits inflamed with wine, than he drew me to the gaming table, where, before morning, I loſt every ſhilling I had in the world; I applied to Potter to lend me 50 guineas, as he had won more than 200 of me.</p>
            <p>Laughing heartily he told me, it had ever been a maxim with him, never to lend his money to a man who had not prudence to keep his own; "but harkee, Frank," ſaid he, "I'll give thee my beſt advice gratis: ſuch a noble ſpirited young fellow as thou art, needs never be at a loſs for money, while he can ſnap a trigger,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037140_0012_100C93FEC675A7F0"/>
and the highway is leſt open for him to practiſe upon. Men who follow the ſame courſe of pleaſure, are the laſt people in the world to help each other in the hour of diſtreſs; virtuous men, Frank, only feel for the wants of their friends, and they alone find pleaſure in relieving them." He then whiſtled himſelf off.</p>
            <p>When I got home, I ſat revolving in my mind how to get myſelf out of my preſent difficulties, when in a fatal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Satan whiſpered in my ears the word FORGERY. At firſt I ſtarted at the thought, but my poverty was clamorous, my pride ſtartled at diſgrace, although my conſcience did not ſhudder at the crime. I knew I could copy Mr. Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent's hand exactly, I ſnatched up the pen to draw a bill upon him for 500l. but a cold ſhivering ſeizing me, it dropt from my ſingers, a ſtrong ſenſe of my guilt now overtook me, I tore what I had written to pieces, and exclaimed, I am a free man again; and for a moment felt thankful that I had been enabled to reſiſt the violence of temptation. I ſat pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, however, how I ſhould maintain myſelf, again I was aſſaulted with the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037140_0013_100C94016C9D8DF8"/>
dread of poverty, and again I ſnatched up the pen, drew the fatal bill, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly went out and got it accepted.</p>
            <p>But the moment I ſought to take reſt at night on my pillow, I felt as if all the horrors of Hell had ſeized me. I jumped out of bed in my ſleep, and was going to throw myſelf out of the window, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving dreamt that I was apprehended, the people of the houſe, awakened by my cries, ran into the room, concluding ſome villains had broken in, and were going to murder me.</p>
            <p>I never afterwards went into the ſtreet but my fears told me I was the ſubject of converſation of all the people I met. Once I happened to hear one man ſay to another, pointing to a third, "that's he, that's he," I took to my heels, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that I myſelf was meant, and ran from one ſtreet to another, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whither, till my ſight failed me, and through loſs of breath, I dropped down in a fit. Some humane people, however recovered me, and put me into a hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney coach which carried me home.</p>

One day, a ſudden guſt of wind blew open my chamber door, again I concluded the officers were coming to take me. Snatching up the poker to defend my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I ſwore I would not be taken alive, when turning about ſuddenly. I caught a glimpſe of myſelf in the glaſs, my eyes looked wild, my lips quivered, my jaws dropped, my teeth ſhattered, and my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhook, as though the laſt agonies of death were upon me. On finding I was once more become the dupe of my fears, my ſpirits rallied again, I dreſſed and went to the play; there I met Sally Weſt, whom I had not ſeen for ſome weeks; for, to ſay the truth, I dreaded to meet an old acquaintance from the time I committed the forgery; after the play, we went off together to ſup at a tavern, we had not been there a quarter of an hour when ſhe made an excuſe for quitting the room in about ten minutes ſhe returned to me, expreſſing in the tendereſt terms the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ſhe had to ſee me again.</p>
            <p>We were, as I believed, juſt going to ſit down to ſupper, when the waiters came in followed by two of Sir John Fielding's men. Immediately, with the

greateſt coolneſs, Miſs Weſt aroſe, and and laying her hand on my ſhoulder ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, 'the Philiſtines be upon thee, Samſon.' "Gentlemen," continued ſhe to the officers, "this is my good friend Mr. Francis H**** of whom you have been ſome time in ſearch. Perhaps Frank, continued ſhe, "you do not know that your forgery is diſcovered, and that 100l. reward is offered for taking you, when I left the room juſt now it was to write a note to theſe gentlemen, ſignifying to them where you were to be found; I ſee you are terrified, but hear me for the laſt time perhaps, and you will leſs won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at my conduct. Early in life, Frank, I was betrayed to ruin, by a baſe deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man; my reputation once blaſted, I was deſerted by all the virtuous part of my own ſex; by having bad examples always before my eyes, I ſoon became hardened in ſin and abandoned to ſhame. I have lately contracted debts; if they are not immediately diſcharged I ſhall be ſent to a jail; this jail I know not how to avoid but by ſending you thither in my ſtead, as the reward offered for taking <hi>you</hi> will juſt ſet <hi>me</hi> free from my creditors."</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:037140_0016_100C940787544438"/>
I was ſtruck motionleſs with terror, and fainted away on the officers approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to tie my hands behind me; not had I the leaſt recollection of what paſſed, till I found myſelf ſafe locked in my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. About a week after this, the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er came to tell me, there was a priſoner lately brought in who was very deſirous of ſeeing me, and as ſhe appeared an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of great pity, he offered to conduct me to her. On entering the chamber, I ſaw a young woman very ſhabbily dreſſed, lying on a miſerable bed, in a very weak condition.</p>
            <p>"Doſt thou not know me, Frank?" ſaid ſhe in a hollow broken voice? "Haſt thou loſt all remembrance of Patty Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent." I felt inſtantly as if ſtruck with a thunderbolt. "Merciful heaven?" cried I, falling on my knees by the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, "I am unable to bear the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment my crimes have brought upon me! O God of mercy ſupport my troubled ſoul." She kindly urged me to be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaid ſhe wiſhed not to ſee me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach me for the evils I had brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, but only to tell me with her laſt breath that ſhe forgave me. "It is not

an hour ſince, Frank," continued ſhe, "that I heard you were my fellow pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and what is worſe at my father's ſuit. I will not reproach you, Frank, I tell you again, for all the miſeries you have brought upon me, becauſe you are a priſoner and in chains. If my breath will hold out, I will endeavour to give you a ſhort hiſtory of myſelf ſince we parted. On your refuſing to make me your lawful wife, I quitted your lodgings, reſolving by my labour to eat the bread of induſtry rather than follow a courſe of vice for a wretched ſubſiſtence. I hired a garret in Holborn, where I applied for needle-work, and ſoon obtained it. In a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three months after our ſeparation, my infant came into the world, I ſold my clothes for my ſupport during my confinement, but that reſource ſoon failed me. My health and ſtrength declined, I was ſeized with a conſtant fever and cough, and quite unable to ſupply the ſcanty morſel of bread for the day, yet reſolved to die ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than afflict my dear parents with the knowledge of my miſery. At length being too weak to labour, I contracted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſmall debts, for which I was ſeized and brought hither, I have however ſince

Obſerving I was ſpeechleſs with agony, poor Patty went on, "I did not wiſh to ſee you, Frank, to afflict you, I wiſh only to warn you with my dying breath to repent the evil of your ways, and humble your ſoul before God. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for ſin, Frank, though bitter for the moment, yet I have found health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the ſoul, and however the wicked who are at eaſe, may deride the God who made them, yet the ſighing and the ſorrowing heart will flee unto him, as the only preſent help in time of trouble; I ſhall very ſoon lay down my heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of ſickneſs and ſorrow, and eſcape from a darkſome priſon, as I humbly truſt, to everlaſting reſt.—O Frank!

            <p>Here ſhe was interrupted by the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected entrance of Mr. and Mrs. Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. O ye, who ſhall hereafter read my ſtory, drop a tear of pity at the agony I

They no ſooner beheld their child, than each by turns tenderly embraced her, aſſured her of their forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and gently child her, for having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed herſelf ſo long, adding, that as a penitent child they would moſt gladly have received her, though they would have ſhunned her, if they found her living in proſperous wickedneſs. She thanked them, and ſaid.</p>

Great Heaven! is there any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for me to ſuffer hereafter beyond what I endured at the moment? A dead ſilence ſucceeded for ſome time, my groans only were heard. As ſoon as Mr. Vincent had ſomewhat recovered the ſhock, he raiſed himſelf from the body of his child, and ſpoke to me as follows:</p>

            <head>TRUE EXAMPLES OF THE Interposition of Providence, IN THE DISCOVERY AND PUNISHMENT OF MURDER, (By that famous Magistrate, Mr. Justice, Fielding.)</head>
            <p>A Man was taken up on ſuſpicion of Murder, but when brought to the Bar, the evidence appeared not ſtrong enough to convict him. He pretended to be quite eaſy about the matter, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved with great boldneſs, becauſe he knew there was no witneſs to the fact, for he had really committed the Murder, and had taken every caution to prevent a diſcovery; making uſe of all that care and prudence which are always much ſharpened by a ſenſe of guilt, though they have hardly ever been known to anſwer the end; ſome one circumſtance being generally overlooked, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Divine Providence, in order
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037140_0026_100C941C08E23B20"/>
to lead to a ſure, though perhaps diſtant diſcovery. Sooner or later all ſins come to light.</p>
            <p>When he came upon his trial, the Judge obſerved in the Man's countenance an uneaſineſs, terror, and confuſion, which all his pretended boldneſs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of innocence could not hide. This much increaſed his ſuſpicion, and he therefore kept his eye ſteadily fixed on his face during the whole time. As ſoon as the laſt witneſs was diſmiſſed, the Man aſked, with pretended coolneſs, if they had any more evidence to produce againſt him. The Judge fixed his eyes ſternly upon his face, and in a very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen manner aſked him this queſtion. Friend, do you not yourſelf know that one <hi>could</hi> appear againſt you, whoſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence would put the matter out of all doubt?—At this the Man ſtarted, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed extremely terrified, and eagerly cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out—"My Lord, he is not a legal witneſs, no Man can ſpeak in his own cauſe, nor was the wound I gave him half ſo large as what he ſhews againſt me."</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:037140_0027_100C941D93AFEAC0"/>
The Judge, who had a very deep knowledge of human nature, preſently perceived by the Man's ſtarting, and the wildneſs and terror of his look, that he was the real Murderer, and that in the diſtraction of a guilty conſcience his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination had raiſed up to his mind the Ghoſt of the Murdered man. The Judge therefore acting upon ſuch a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſuppoſition, talked to the priſoner accordingly. By his farther examination, he ſoon brought him to confeſs that he had been guilty of the Murder for which he was now tried; though, as was ſaid above he had made ſure of being acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe he knew no human witneſs could be brought to appear againſt him. But the juſtice of God made his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience his accuſer. After this full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the fact, he was condemned, and hanged in chains at the very place where he declared the Murder had been committed. At his death he confeſſed that his guilty conſcience was ſo haunted with the crime, that upon his trial he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believed that the Ghoſt of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Man had ſtood before him with a wound, twice as large as that which he had given him,</p>

He therefore made his eſcape into France, where he lived for ſome years, and began to fancy that he was quite ſafe; but GOD's thoughts are not as our thoughts, and the voice of blood will be heard by Almighty vengeance ſooner or later. But from the horrors of his guilty conſcience, which almoſt every night preſented before his Eyes, whether ſleeping or waking, his murdered Friend, he felt tenfold the puniſhment which by flight he had vainly hoped to eſcape.</p>

               <p>But public Juſtice though ſlow at laſt overtook him; for the very evening that he landed in a Wherry at Queen-Hithe Stairs, as he was walking up Cheapſide in order to get into a Coach, juſt in the duſk, and by the very door of his Murdered Friend, he heard a voice cry "ſtop him, ſtop him, there he is."—On this he ran as faſt as he was able, and ſoon found himſelf fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a great Mob.

               <p>IN Leiceſterſhire not far from Lut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terworth, lived a Miller, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a grudge againſt a man, had murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in his Mill, and privately bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him in his Garden. Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had committed this horrid crime, the Miller found means to change his place of abode, and ſettled in another country a great way off. Here he lived a long time, believing that his villany would never be diſcovered; but this hardened wretch did not reflect, that though no fellow-creature ſaw him, GOD did, and that though God is pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and long-ſuffering, he ſeldom fails to bring wicked actions to light in this world, and never fails to puniſh them in the next. Twenty years had now paſſed over his head in ſafety, and he thought
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037140_0032_100C9427D9FDFDE0"/>
he might without any danger venture to return to viſit ſome old friends in the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage where he had formerly lived. All is now ſafe thought he, and it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the old ſtory ſhould be ever brought to light.</p>
               <p>Juſt at that very time while he was on this viſit in his native village, by the Providence of GOD, the Miller who had preſent poſſeſſion of the Mill, having occaſion to dig uncommonly deep in his Garden, found the Body, or rather the Bones of the Murdered Man.—The neighbours then recollected that about twenty years ago, a man had been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the Pariſh, and was never heard of after. Some likewiſe recollected who was then owner of the Mill, and that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Miller being now in the Pariſh, they all ran to the houſe where he was, and ſurrounding it called on him as the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of the Perſon whoſe bones had been thus providentially diſcovered. The wretched Miller was ſo ſhocked and confounded with the ſudden and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral accuſation; and Conſcience, which had ſlept for twenty years, was now ſo horribly ſtung, that he ſoon confeſſed the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037140_0033_100C9429C7FF7470"/>
Fact, was tried, found guilty, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to his juſt deſerts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The following observations of this wise and famous Magistrate, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily, just as well suited to the present time, as the time when that great Man wrote them, I hope they may he useful to my Readers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the moſt dreadful crime of Murder, hath of late years increaſed in a very deplorable degree in this Kingdom, is a fact which every Man muſt confeſs, and which every good Man muſt very bitterly lament. Till this age indeed, cruel and bloody ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ſo ſeldom heard of in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that when they happened, they appeared as prodigies, and raiſed not only the aſtoniſhment, but the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of the People—Murder is but very lately began to be common among us.</p>
               <p>For my part I ſincerely declare I can diſcover no more than one cauſe of the horrid evil of which I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining—ONE indeed perfectly capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037140_0034_100C942B53A57AE0"/>
of producing every miſchief, and which has more than all other cauſes contributed to produce, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe all the evils with which the public is at preſent ſo extremely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</p>
               <p>My ſenſible Reader will preſently gueſs what I mean.—I mean that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral NEGLECT. I fear I may ſay CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEMPT OF RELIGION, which hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe few years, ſo fatally overſpread this whole Kingdom, till it has reached the very loweſt ranks of Men:—It cannot be otherwiſe, for when we think of the ſolemn threatenings of ALMIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY GOD againſt the crime of Murder, how is it poſſible to think that a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture who believes that there is a GOD ſhould, unleſs he be a Fool, or a Madman, thus audaciouſly fly in the face of that AWFUL BEING, in whoſe words we muſt be aſſured is all truth, and in whoſe right hand is all power.</p>

                  <l>WHERE Juſtice waves her vengeful hand</l>
                  <l>Tremendous o'er a guilty land,</l>
                  <l>Almighty GOD thy awful power,</l>
                  <l>With fear and trembling, we adore.</l>
                  <l>Where ſhall we fly, but to thy feet?</l>
                  <l>Our only refuge is thy ſeat;</l>
                  <l>Thy ſeat, where potent mercy pleads,</l>
                  <l>And hurls thy thunder from our heads.</l>
                  <l>While peace and plenty bleſs'd our days,</l>
                  <l>Where was the tribute of thy praiſe?</l>
                  <l>Ungrateful race! how have we ſpent</l>
                  <l>The bleſſings which thy goodneſs lent.</l>
                  <l>But when diſtreſs and waſting war</l>
                  <l>With threat'ning frown thy wrath appear;</l>
                  <l>Still war and want are but thy ſlaves,</l>
                  <l>Nor can deſtroy when mercy ſaves.</l>
                  <l>Look down, O LORD, with pitying eye;</l>
                  <l>Tho' loud our crimes for vengeance cry;</l>
                  <l>Let mercy's louder voice prevail,</l>
                  <l>Nor thy long-ſuffering patience fail.</l>
                  <l>Encourag'd by the ſacred word,</l>
                  <l>May we not plead the bleſt record,</l>
                  <l>That when a humbled nation mourns,</l>
                  <l>Thy riſing wrath to pity turns;</l>
                  <l>O let thy ſovereign grace impart</l>
                  <l>Contrition to each rocky heart,</l>
                  <l>And bid ſincere repentance flow,</l>
