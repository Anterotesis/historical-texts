            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

maintain, as you know, in the house. I won't say what they cost me, because that's charity—but I know I have a tender heart and a sweet temper, that would be my ruin, if I did not watch my purse at both ends. But come—if I can't lend you my money, I'll give you my advice. Go to Levi, the great Jew, and he'll lend you, on the picture nearly its full value.</p>

                  <p>No—not for all the world. My father, to be sure, won't see me; and I always thought that very strange: But, in every thing else, he is so good to me, and so kind!—</p>

                  <p>Why should he shun me so, Josephine? An't I his child? And, indeed, indeed, I never did any thing willingly to offend him. Why should he drive me from his sight, as soon as I was born? I grew up far away from him, and he forbids me now to come to him, that I may take his hand, and press it to my lips.</p>

beg'd so hard to see him; and the words were, all, so blotted, he must have seen that I cried all the while I was writing it. I fancied in the evening he looked more thoughtful than ever. Perhaps he may be brought to give his consent to see me at last. Don't you think he might, Josephine?</p>

three hundred crowns! I wish they were three thousand, with all my heart.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. R.</speaker>
                  <p>An usurer, forsooth! Ah, child, child! you learn to cypher and cast accounts, to be sure; but how many pence there are in a dollar, you'll never learn to reckon as long as you live.

                  <p>That, now, may be very true: and, somehow or other, I always thought charity much easier than arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. I know Mr. Van Snarl takes a deal of pleasure in counting up his dollars; but, for my part, I think there is more pleasure, by half, in giving money to the distress'd, and letting them count it for me.

                     <p>Why, that's droll. I think it's a devilish neat thing—He means to set up in trade for himself, and he thinks Louisa will make him a very suitable wife.</p>

                     <p>The free and liberal use we make of it. Wealth, brother, is like a sword, placed in various hands. Fools are laughed at for their ignorance in using it; knaves, who grasp it, hurt their neighbours with it; wise and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent men, alone, know how to guard themselves with it, while they protect the weak, who want their assistance.</p>

                     <p>True, when one has met with hardships, one looks older than one really is. But, dear Mr. Totum, marriage is a serious step; when I lost poor dear Dr. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learius—Heaven grant him rest!—I made a vow never to marry again.</p>

Here, girls, I have not shewn you the handsome snuff-box I have received from the Minister. Look at it, brother: Totum says it is worth two thousand dollars.

I supposed as much. Methinks a girl that has nothing but a smooth face to recommend her. and her feet under a strange table, might give herself fewer airs. If I had not the sweetest temper in the world—</p>

If that is meant as a joke, Sir, it is, without under-rating it, a very clumsy one; but, if you are in earnest, I must inform you, that both my birth and character place me so far beyond this low suspicion, that I will sooner die than consent to give you the gross proof you require of your absurdity. I utterly despise the meanness of your conduct; and leave you, lest, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in it, you should rouse me to convert the contempt I feel for you, into chastisement.

                     <p>The commission of my visit is then at an end.— I could wish to prolong it on my own account. Your manner has interested me—will you answer me, as a man, what I shall ask you?</p>

                     <p>Your resentment of my brother's proposition was natural: but before you avowed that resentment, I fancied that I remark'd a certain embarrassment in your manner, which appeared to proceed from some other cause than indignation. What was that cause?</p>

                     <p>Certainly none to me. To Poland, to my struggling country, I sacrificed my wealth as I would have sacrificed my life, if it had required it—My country is no more, and we are wanderers on a burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed earth, finding no refuge but in the hearts of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and virtuous.</p>

                     <p>That has ever been my friend. The little ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents with which the affluence of my parents crowned my education, have preserved me from the extremes of indigence. The spirit of Poland has supplied the rest.</p>

Another time we will— <stage>(looks round in great agitation)</stage>
Yonder comes Louisa—let me see you again. At another time if the recital be not painful to you, I will request your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence: and should it open afresh the wounds of your bosom, be persuaded that you will meet a friend, who will strive to heal them—one practised in sorrow—one, whose delight it would be to pour out the balm of comfort, and confer a happiness which he cannot hope himself to taste.</p>

                     <speaker>Adel.</speaker>
                     <p>Because poverty, which in general silences the feelings, is not always master over the heart.</p>

                     <p>It signifies something, Louisa—for the rich man is at least received with politeness, the poor one, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver worthy in other respects, is rejected with scorn.</p>

                     <p>Well,—during the last struggles of our expiring state, though private and important duties detained me at a distance, I embarked my whole fortune on the side of those, who, even against a victorious enemy, wished to defend their native country—you know the result—my situation here speaks it—except a trifling stipend that is still left to me, I have no remaining possession but health, no hope but industry—Alas! my poor country!</p>

You are a good-natur'd soul, and you know what a plague it is to share a fortune with the person whom we love best, and so would save Louisa that trouble.

Now where shall I put this note, that he may see it directly? On the table—no, it won't be safe—

where shall I put the money?— This box—Aye it is open

Eh! what is this! the very bill I sent by yesterday's post to my daughter! how can it have come into this man's box?—Could the servant I sent with the letter have opened it?—he is seemingly honest—nay I know him to be so—"Fie, fie, I'm ashamed of myself when I suspect an honest man." Surely Adelbert could not

my money too shall stay where it was— <stage>(puts the roleau in his pocket)</stage>

Egad, he's a deep one. Where can he keep the balance sheet? must have private books somewhere— <stage>(sees the box on the table)</stage>—Oh, ho! here

we have him—now see contents—now we'll detect the spy— <stage>(takes out the bill of exchange and reads.)</stage>
"On demand pay to this my order, the sum of three hundred crowns." Accepted too! As good as Bank—ah, your spies must have the wherewith
<stage>(<hi>reads again</hi>)</stage>
"Le—o—" What! "Leopold Van"—drawn by my master's brother! Zounds, this is forgery!
"Aye, aye, this is the use he makes of getting his head into good books."
We'll go over a few more folios here.
<stage>(<hi>draws a chair to the table, sits down and begins to rummage the box.</hi>)</stage>
If I can barely find enough to hang him, that's all,
<stage>(rummaging)</stage>
that's all the harm I wish him. Hark! did not I hear something?
<stage>(<hi>Rises suddenly, replaces every thing in the box, except the note, and shuts the box hastily, which clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with a spring-lock.</hi>)</stage>
I'll take a peep down the street, to be sure that Mr. Iron-driver is not nearer than I sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.
<stage>(<hi>He runs to the window, looks out, and starts.</hi>)</stage>
Oh, here's a blunder; here's a scratch—Zounds! here's Old Scratch himself. Yonder comes the Pole; I see his head. Whip off with the box—Egad, the best way.—
<stage>(Takes up the box and goes towards the door.)</stage>—
"We'll have a halter for you, Mr. Forgery, and then see whose is the safest head; your's with a rope round it, or Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Totum's with eighty thousand marks to credit."
<stage>(<hi>Goes to the door, tries to open it, and finds it locked.</hi>)</stage>
Eh! how's this? the door fast!—O Lord! I am check'd. A plague on him; I hear him at the foot of the staircase— there are only thirty-four steps, two landing places, and a turning, between me and a sword through my body. Oh, the devil! here he is on the stairs. Lets return the note — <stage>(sets the box down on the table, and tries to open it.)</stage>
Devil on devil! the box shuts with a spring-lock, and the lid is fast.
"O lud, if this piece of forgery is found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, I shall be brought in an accomplice, and then there'll be a halter for <hi>me.</hi>"
I have open'd a fine head of account here. Where shall I put the note? Here is a trunk as large as our ledger. I'll insert it here; he won't think of opening this.
"At least the note will be wrote off from my head."</p>

One word before I go, my dear new friend—You perceive I am likely to have some interest in this house, and if it can avail you with Louisa, you shall find that the mark a ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal has left on your wrist, will be much sooner worn away than the impression you have made on an honest man's heart.

                     <p>Aye, to be sure! Mrs. Rose must be every where at once! Well, child, what do you want with Mrs. Rose?</p>

                     <speaker>Mrs. R.</speaker>
                     <p>A young gentleman! —I was on the stair-case, with a sugar-loaf under my arm—so I stopp'd and made a curtsy. Mr. Adelbert bow'd very politely, I must say that for him—but the other <hi>young gentleman</hi> brush'd by me, as if he would have knock'd me down.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Jos.</speaker>

                     <p>Well, Louisa—</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jos.</speaker>
                     <p>Have you heard what occasioned the duel?</p>

                     <speaker>Loui.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh! it was such a generous action of Mr. Adelbert, to—</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. R.</speaker>
                     <p>A generous action! to thrust a sword through a man's body! You have forgot, I fancy, what excellent things my husband said in his sermon against duels— Poor dear Mr. Olearius!</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Loui.</speaker>
                     <p>Dear mother, if you would now but step up to poor Mr. Adelbert—perhaps he wants help—you have several fine receipts for wounds, you know.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. R.</speaker>
                     <p>Child, I have a great many excellent wound balsams—but <hi>I</hi> step up into the young man's room!— You know before one has come to a certain age—</p>

                     <speaker>Loui.</speaker>
                     <p>A certain age!—and what does that signify? I think at any time of life we should give our help to a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creature, when it is wanted.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. R.</speaker>
                     <p>You are right, my dear—When we can be useful, we must sometimes disregard slanderous tongues; —so I'll carry Mr. Adelbert the black ointment, which stands on the chimney in my room—but don't let any body know it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jos.</speaker>
                     <p>There's only that young man there—he won't tell.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. R.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh, mercy! if it should be known that I visited a young man in his bed-room!—however, I'll carry him the black ointment.

                     <speaker>Loui.</speaker>
                     <p>I summoned up all my courage, and spoke to him—and am so happy—</p>

                     <speaker>Loui.</speaker>
                     <p>He promis'd to tell me all his sorrows,</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jos.</speaker>
                     <p>Then I don't wonder at your being so happy.— Upon my word you are much obliged to him—</p>

                     <speaker>Jos.</speaker>
