            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>An usurer, forsooth! Ah, child, child! you learn to cypher and cast accounts, to be sure; but how many pence there are in a dollar, you'll never learn to reckon as long as you live.

                  <p>That, now, may be very true: and, somehow or other, I always thought charity much easier than arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. I know Mr. Van Snarl takes a deal of pleasure in counting up his dollars; but, for my part, I think there is more pleasure, by half, in giving money to the distress'd, and letting them count it for me.

                     <p>The free and liberal use we make of it. Wealth, brother, is like a sword, placed in various hands.

I supposed as much. Methinks a girl that has nothing but a smooth face to recommend her. and her feet under a strange table, might give herself fewer airs. If I had not the sweetest temper in the worldâ</p>

If that is meant as a joke, Sir, it is, without under-rating it, a very clumsy one; but, if you are in earnest, I must inform you, that both my birth and character place me so far beyond this low suspicion, that I will sooner die than consent to give you the gross proof you require of your absurdity. I utterly despise the meanness of your conduct; and leave you, lest, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in it, you should rouse me to convert the contempt I feel for you, into chastisement.

Go on with your romantic notions:â Here's a pretty couple of you!âone does not choose a husband with eighty thousand marks, and the other won't go to sea to make his fortune for life. I wish you had nothing but sentiment and romance to eat for a fortnight, and by that time, you, Miss, would take Tilman Totum, with eighty thousand marks, and you, sir, without a pound in your pocket, would be glad to sail to the coast of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaâZounds! if I had not the sweetest temper in the world, I should be kept in a perpetual passion.</p>

                     <p>Well,âduring the last struggles of our expiring state, though private and important duties detained me at a distance, I embarked my whole fortune on the side of those, who, even against a victorious enemy, wished to defend their native countryâyou know the resultâmy situation here speaks itâexcept a trifling stipend that is still left to me, I have no remaining possession but health, no hope but industryâAlas! my poor country!</p>

                     <p>It is hard to believe, indeed; but all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances consideredâThis gentleman shall judge. When I went out this morning, I left nothing but a few trifles of apparel in my trunk, and at my return I find you locked in my room, and here a note of exchange.

                     <p>No: I came to marry Josephine, Von Snarl's daughter.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Adel.</speaker>
                     <p>And who wants to force Louisa on you?</p>

                     <speaker>H. Wil.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, are not Josephine and Louisa the same person?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Adel.</speaker>
                     <p>By no means.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>H. Wil.</speaker>
                     <p>Then one of them has made a fool of me. Which of the two is the merrier?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Adel.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>H. Wil.</speaker>
                     <p>Hurra! that's my girl then!âshake hands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainâthe first was a sentimental shake, and this is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one. We shall not be rivals.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Adel.</speaker>
                     <p>Again I do not comprehend you.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>H. Wil.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, the truth is, I am very properly served âI came into this house under a false name, and the girls have outwitted meâJosephine suspected my design, and pass'd herself on me for Louisa Rose. I'll be reveng'd; tho' egad, I like her better than ever.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Adel.</speaker>
                     <p>Then you know nothing of Louisa?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>H. Wil.</speaker>
                     <p>I never imagined, till this moment, that there was such a person in existence. I'll go down and look for that merry girl again, and if I find herâ <stage>(<hi>going.</hi>)</stage>
One word before I go, my dear new friendâYou perceive I am likely to have some interest in this house, and if it can avail you with Louisa, you shall find that the mark a ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal has left on your wrist, will be much sooner worn away than the impression you have made on an honest man's heart. Come along.</p>

                     <speaker>H. W.</speaker>
                     <p>He requested me never to put my foot over his threshold again.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jos.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeed! and what induces you to refuse him such a trifling request?</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>I do notâI mean to take him at his word, only I design to take you with me.</p>

                     <p>I did not wish to contradict my father, and as my heart was free, I neither promised or refused, but I was determined first to take a look at you. If I had not liked you, I should have been off again in a moment: butâhere I am stillâand, to own the truth at onceâI do like you.</p>

                     <p>And if this be the case, I may as well make the constables void.âHymen has protested my draught: and, for fear the Pole should make a scratch in my ledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I won't leave him a <hi>single side</hi> for a memorandum sheet.âHang Hymen!âPlague light on the Pole!</p>
