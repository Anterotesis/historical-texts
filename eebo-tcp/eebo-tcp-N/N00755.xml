            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>And indeed the long abſence of <hi>ſome Believers</hi> from, and the careleſs haſting of <hi>all ungodly</hi> to, the Supper of the Lord, is much to be lamented.

The one dare not omit to pray, and lead a Holy Life, and yet will not come to waſh their Hearts; the other will not pray, nor lead a holy life, and yet will come to imbrue their hands in the blood of Chriſt. Such is the unthankfulneſs of ſome, that ſhould, but do not; and the wickedneſs of ſome that do, but ſhould not come unto this Goſpel Feaſt.</p>
            <p>Now, to prevent theſe two great evils, for the time to come, (as it might prove at leaſt, I hope to ſome that might peruſe this little Treatiſe) in which ſomething is ſaid to provoke the one to their duty, and deter the other from their ſin and danger.</p>

To which are annexed three Dialogues concerning the Lords Supper, for the help of thoſe that are the weaker ſort of Chriſtians, that do deſire to partake thereof.

Lord ordained at ſuch a time as this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The external <hi>Elements</hi> and <hi>Signs,</hi> Bread and Wine. In Sacraments there is ſomething ſeen, and ſomething underſtood; ſomething perceived by Senſe, and ſomething apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Faith. Sacraments are Glaſſes for our underſtanding, and Monuments for our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, that by mean and viſible ſigns, we might perceive and call to mind ſublime and inviſible things. Here is Bread, even bread of Life, to fill the hungry Soul, and Wine to ſatisfie the thirſty, and to chear the drooping Soul.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The Sacramental <hi>Actions,</hi> 1. Of Chriſt, He took the Bread, and bleſſed it, and brake it: He took the Cup and bleſſed it; and did diſtribute both. 2. Of the Receivers, who are to take and eat, to take and drink; Chriſt is the Giver, Chriſt is the Gift: And what Chriſt in love doth give, Believers with joy and thankfulneſs ſhould receive.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Explication</hi> of this Myſtery. <hi>This is my Body: This Cup is the New-Teſtament in my Blood</hi>: The Bread was not turned into Chriſts real Body; nor the Wine into his Blood: For, did the Diſciples eat Chriſts real Body, when he was with them at the Table? or did they drink his real Blood, which then was in his Veins, and in his Body, and not in the Cup? Or did they not then ſee that Chriſts real Body and Blood was really diſtinct from the Bread and Wine? And did they not ſee it was real Bread, and taſte it was real Bread,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000909_0012_0FACA0EF213DA4C0"/>
and handle it as real Bread? Or is now Chriſt's glorious Body ſubject to Corruption, as is the Bread that is in the Sacrament, and when it is received? Or can a finite Body be in Heaven and upon Earth, in ſo many places at once, as the Sacrament might be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in at the ſame time? Or do Drunkards and Swearers, Hypocrites and Unbelievers, really eat and drink Chriſt's real Body and Blood? The meaning is, this is a ſign of my Body, and a ſign of my Blood, the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of both. As Circumciſion is ſaid to be the Covenant, ſo the Bread is Chriſts Body; <hi>Gen</hi> 17.10. <hi>This is my Covenant which ye ſhall keep between me and you, and thy ſeed after thee: Every man Child among you ſhall be Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed:</hi> But yet Circumciſion was not the Covenant, but a Sign and Seal thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4 11. <hi>And he</hi> (that is, <hi>Abraham) received the Sign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Faith which he had being yet uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed</hi>—So the Cup in the Sacrament is ſaid to be the New-Teſtament or Covenant, but it is not the very Covenant, but the Sign and Seal thereof.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The Application of this unto its proper Subject</hi>; Chriſt declaring who they be that <hi>this</hi> and the things ſignified do belong unto, <hi>Which is broken for you,</hi> it is according to the mind of Chriſt, that Believers in the Lords Supper ſhould make particular application of himſelf, and of the fruits of his Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to themſelves: a Believer may take
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000909_0013_0FACA0EFE1C76660"/>

                  </gap> ſign, and ſomething ſignified.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, In the <hi>Properties</hi> of the Paſchal Lamb, which are in Chriſt our Paſsover.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That was to be without blemiſh; ſo was Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53 9. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.19 &amp; 2.22 <hi>Heb</hi> 7.26.</p>

               <p n="3">3. That muſt be of a year old, in a perfect age; Chriſt about thirty four years, in the prime of his age.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000909_0022_0FACA0F6A206C120"/>
Chriſt was ſeparated from Sinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26.</p>
               <p n="6">6 That roſt with fire; Chriſt with the heat of Gods wrath.</p>
               <p n="7">7 That muſt be eaten; Chriſt muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Faith.</p>
               <p>That muſt be eaten,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By every Family; Chriſt to be received by every Perſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. With unleavened bread; Chriſt and this Sacrament is to be received in ſincerity and truth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 7, 8.</p>
               <p n="3">3 With bitter Herbs; Chriſt and this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, with bitter Repentings.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wholly, all of it muſt be eaten, whole Chriſt muſt be received in all his Offices, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Prieſt, and King, Chriſt as the Paſchal Lamb muſt be received with all his appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</p>
               <p n="5">5. In haſt; Chriſt muſt be received pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, without delay.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, In the <hi>Subject</hi> that muſt eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they were <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and thoſe that were Circumciſed. Thoſe that ſhould partake of this Ordinance ought to be <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed; and Circumciſed in their hearts, if they would have benefit thereby. Thus you ſee the great agreement betwixt thoſe two Ordinances: And were the <hi>Jews</hi> bound to obſerve that, and not Believers under the Goſpel engaged unto this; Nay, I may argue, that there is a greater reaſon why we ſhould be more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to this duty, in as much, wherein they differ, this is more excellent. As,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:000909_0023_0FACA0F76191A890"/>1. In the manner of their ſignification, the Paſſeover ſignified Chriſt that was to come; the Lords Supper, Chriſt already come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Duration. The paſſeover was to continue till the coming of Chriſt in the Fleſh: The Lords Supper till he come again in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the end of the World.</p>
               <p n="3">3 In the perſpicuity and clearneſs: In the former, Chriſts death was ſignified more darkly, in the latter more plainly.</p>
               <p>Now I beſeech you, ſee what the Paſſeover was to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and conſider that <hi>that</hi> the Lords Supper is to us, and there will appear the ſame parity of reaſon for our receiving of this, as for the <hi>Jews</hi> eating of that.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is the plain Injunction of our dying Lord, that we ſhould do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him; Why do you pray? One rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon you will give is, becauſe God Commands it: And if you pray becauſe God commands you, you muſt then do every thing that God commands you, and ſo this: Is it not ſtrictly commanded? Read <hi>Luk</hi> 22.19 The whole is commanded. <hi>This do in remembrance of me,</hi> Mat. 26.26, 27. The particular Acts are commanded, <hi>Take, Eat, Drink,</hi> &amp; will you ſay you will not? Will that become a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt? You ſay not, you will not, but you know you do not, and that is as bad.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt did ordain it for this very end, that believers ſhould have a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him in the partaking of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: We are apt to forget the Works of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000909_0024_0FACA0F8259AC908"/>
God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.13. Too apt to forget the benefits we received from God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.2. But which is moſt to be wondred at, we are too prone to forget God our Saviour, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get him that delivered us from the curſe of the Law, by being made a Curſe for us: From the wrath of God, by bearing it himſelf; from the ſting of death, by dying for us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.21. <hi>They forgat God their Saviour:</hi> Oh, what memories have we! that can remember our Relations, our Worldly Affairs, and forget that God that made us, and Chriſt that did redeem us: Now Chriſt would live in our thoughts and memory, and to heal and help the ſlippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs thereof, hath inſtituted this Ordinance, which you cannot partake of aright, but you muſt remember him</p>

Why then, tell Chriſt ſo, if you dare; What is this but to correct the wiſdom of your Lord by your own folly? but I tell you, you cannot ſo well remember Chriſt without this Ordinance as you may, by a careful frequent attendance upon God in it; for it is not a ſpeculative, hiſtorical remembrance that he did bleed and dye: for ſo the Devils themſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when you would have your heart to ſorrow afreſh for your Pride and Unbelief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other ſins, go to the Sacrament; which is a Sacrament to bring to remembrance; there remember the dignity and Innocency of the Sufferer, the greatneſs of his Sufferings. 1 From God. 2 From Men. 3.

               </p>
               <p>Baptiſm is but once to be adminiſtred, but the Lords Supper is often to be received; the frequency of it is not determined, often it muſt be, how often is not expreſſed; if you had opportunity every Lords Day, and you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed and improved it, your Soul may thrive and grow the more in grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Meals which are for nouriſhment muſt be often; you often eat, and you often drink for the nouriſhment of Nature, and yet it is not told you how often you muſt eat, how often you muſt drink, but the ſenſe and feeling of the want of your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Conſider therefore,</p>
               <p>Do you not often ſtand in need of being waſhed in the Blood of Chriſt? Do you not often defile your ſelf, and gather filth upon your Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſhould you not often apply your ſelf to the Fountain of the cleanſing Blood of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:000909_0043_0FACA16C6307E928"/>Secondly, Do you not often blot your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, and diſturb your peace? and have you not need of the frequent uſe of that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, wherein God might renew your evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and ſpeak peace unto your Conſcience? Do you often contract guilt, and ſhould you not often come to have your pardon ſealed and confirmed to your Soul in the blood of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Do you not often need the means of ſpiritual warmth and quicknings? Are you not often dull, and often dead, and often luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm? and do not thoſe that are often ſick, often need their Phiſick to purge and make them well? If you are ſometime warmed in an Ordinance, do not your affections abate again? That you have not that livelineſs of affections, nor that reviving joy, which in the actual performance of the duty you did find? and is it needful to exhort you that have found the benefit of this Ordinance, to go of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to it? Let the Experience of what you have found in it, and the want you do lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by ſeldom approaching unto it, quicken your deſires after a frequent attendance upon God in it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Do you not often need ſo great an help for the breaking and ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

be put in remembrance of Gods diſpleaſure againſt it, his hatred that he bears unto it, &amp; the dreadful effects and deſerts thereof, and is not this done more livelily in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? Gods diſpleaſure againſt ſin is more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the Death of Chriſt, than in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Angels out of Heaven, or <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe; or in the Deſtruction of the Old World, or in the burning of <hi>Sodom,</hi> or in the Damnation of innumerable unbelieving and impenitent Perſons.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Do you not often need ſo great an help for the increaſing of your Love to God and Chriſt? Do you often complain that you love God no more, and will you not more often uſe this ſo great a means for the encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of your Love?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Do you not often need ſo great an help for the ſtrengthning of your Faith and Hope, that you may be more able to make a particular application of Chriſt and his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to your Soul, and to have a more lively Hope of the Kingdom of Heaven?</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Do you not often need ſo great an help to put you in remembrance of your Lord Jeſus? Are you not too apt to forget him and his Love in dying for you? Is he ſo much in your Thoughts as he doth deſerve? Or is it enough to have ſome Occaſional Thoughts of Chriſt? Or ſhould you not more ſolemnly dwell in your Meditations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him? And doth not the Nature and the end of this Ordinance lead and help you to

fix your thoughts more permanently upon him, when you ſee how he was crucified and died for you?</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Do you not often need ſo great an help to make you more thankful for the matchleſs Love wherewith he hath loved you, and the unparallel'd B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Ninthly, Do you not often need ſo great an help for the getting and maintaining of more intimate Communion with God, and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Jeſus Chriſt? Is it not here, that God doth abundantly let forth himſelf into his peoples Hearts? Is it not here, that Believers feel the goings forth of their Hearts in Love unto him, and Deſires after him, and Delight and Joy in him? Do you complain you have ſo little of God, and will not more often go where you may receive more influences from him.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, Do you not more often need ſo great an help for the cloſer knitting of your Heart unto the people of God in greater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and love unto them? Do you love them as you ſhould? Or is there not too great an alienation of your heart and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>Secondly, Then they made a ſtricter ſearch after any bit of leavened Bread, by lighting a Candle, and looking into every little Corner and Chink in the Houſe, the Night before the Paſſeover.</p>
               <p>The Parallel of this is, a Cloſer ſearching of our hearts, by lighting the Candle of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience at the Fire of Gods Word, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into every Room and Corner of our Hearts, leſt there ſhould be any ſin lurking in our Souls, and remaining undiſcovered: We ſhould enquire after the ſins in our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Will, and Affections, what is amiſs in our Love, Delight, Joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, Then having ſound the Reliques and Fragments of leavened Bread, they caſt it out: That they would not only not uſe it, but not have it in their ſight, that they may not ſet their Eyes upon it, nor look towards it, or would burn it till it were conſumed.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, They had a Form of Words for the curſing of that leavened Bread, which they could not find out, <hi>viz. All the Leaven that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Parallel of this is, The diſowning of every ſin, ſeen or not ſeen, after this manner, <hi>Lord, if there be any ſin in me, which after all my ſearching of my Heart, I have not found out, let it be accurſed, let it be as nothing, as the duſt of the Earth; if there be any ſin in me, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, From the Diſcourſe they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came, appears they did prepare for it. This was betwixt the Father and hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt, The Children inquired, <hi>What is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> meaning of this Service</hi>; Then the Parents anſwered, It is the Lords Paſſeover, who paſſed over the houſes of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> when he ſmote the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered our Houſes, <hi>Exod</hi> 12.26, 27.</p>
               <p>The Parallel of this is, That Chriſtians ſhould diſcourſe together, or ſpeak unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in holy Soliloquy, <hi>viz.</hi> What is the meaning, O my Soul, of this Service, of this Love of Chriſt in appointing this holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? What doth it bring to thy remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:000909_0050_0FACA171A555CCE0"/>
O my Soul? And here you have Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of expatiating the whole method of God in exalting the freeneſs of his Grace in Mans Redemption. <hi>Oh, what meant my deareſt Lord in ſhedding of his blood, and ordaining this for the commemoration of it! Surely it was, O my Soul, to deliver thee from miſery, to make thee Partaker of his Grace and Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to Seal it to thee, and make thee to rejoyce in the remembrance of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Children ask, <hi>Why do we eat it with bitter Herbs</hi>? The Parents anſwered, Becauſe the <hi>Egyptians</hi> made the Life of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bitter in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that they may be ſtirred up to greater thankfulneſs unto God.</p>
               <p>The Parallel of this is, That we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon our ſins, which made our lives bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter while we lived in them, and that now we ſhould taſte more bitterneſs in our ſins, than ever we found ſweetneſs, pleaſure and delight therein.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Why <hi>do we eat it with unleavened bread?</hi> The Parents were to anſwer, Becauſe the Dough of our Fathers had not time to be leavened.</p>
               <p>The Parallel of this is, That we muſt make haſte to Chriſt, and eat this New-Teſtament Paſſeover with the unleavened Bread of ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and truth: That we muſt not delay to come out of ſpiritual-<hi>Egypt,</hi> nor go to Chriſt in hypocriſie, but in truth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, From the time there was betwixt the taking, and the killing of the Paſchal
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:000909_0051_0FACA17262A6C9E0"/>
Lamb; the Lamb was taken the tenth day, and killed the fourteenth day of the month, <hi>Exod,</hi> 12.3. <hi>ad</hi> 7. And it is received as a Tradition among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that for the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe four days, the Lamb was tied to their Bed-poſts, that in the Evening when they went to bed, and in the Morning when they aroſe, and in the day-time when they were private in their Chambers; the ſight of the Lamb might affect their hearts, and put them in mind of the work they were to do, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think themſelves of the greatneſs of Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towards them, in delivering them from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> Bondage.</p>
               <p>The Parallel of this is, That believers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords Supper, ſhould take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>It is not ſufficient to ſpend an hour the night before, or in the morning you are to approach unto it, but ſome day before to have it in your thoughts, that you may conſider the greatneſs of the work you are to go about.</p>
               <p>This Example of the <hi>Jews</hi> is cogent unto us, foraſmuch as the Lords Supper is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the Paſſeover.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Neither in the <hi>Institution</hi> of it; the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over was by Gods Ordination, and ſo is the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:000909_0052_0FACA173213EBA18"/>
Lords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Supper, but God appointed that by <hi>Moſes</hi>: But this was by Chriſt himſelf in his own perſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor in the <hi>ſignification</hi> of it: That to put them in remembrance of their deliverance from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and Typically from Hell: This puts us in remembrance of the love of Chriſt, in bringing us from miſery, and freeing us from torments infinitely worſe than <hi>Aegyptian</hi> ſlavery.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor in the <hi>uſe and end</hi> of it, this being a ſeal of the Covenant of Grace, to convey to Believers an aſſurance of the bleſſings of the Covenant of promiſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Nor in the <hi>manner</hi> of its ſignification: That a ſign of Chriſt that was to come and ſuffer; this, that Chriſt is come, and hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſuffered.</p>
               <p>This is my firſt Argument why, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive that we ſhould approach to the Lords Supper, after painful and ſerious preparation: <hi>No Preparation, no participation.</hi> It is not then putting on our finer Cloaths on a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment day, but the Trimming of our hearts, that God expecteth at our hands.</p>
               <p>The Second Argument for preparation for the Sacrament, is taken from the <hi>Author</hi> of it, which is God: The more he that doth invite you to his Table is your Superiour, the more you prepare your ſelves to go to ſit down thereat, more than if he be your Inferiour, or your equal. God is infin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

this Banquet for you, and prepare for it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is a great and a <hi>mighty</hi> God, a God of inconceivable Majeſty, and tranſcendent Glory, whoſe perfection is infinitely above the moſt raiſed apprehenſions of Angels &amp; Men: and would you go unto the Table of a great King with filthy hands, and in your rags? And would you go to the Table of the great King of Heaven and Earth with a filthy heart, and in your ſins?</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is a pure and an <hi>holy God:</hi> Indeed every thing here is holy, the <hi>Signs</hi> are holy Signs, the <hi>things ſignified</hi> are holy things, the <hi>Ends</hi> of the Inſtitution are holy ends, and the <hi>Author</hi> of it is the holy God; and ſhall our hearts only be unholy? the very externals &amp; utenſils about it, are and ſhould be clean; the Cups are clean, the Cloth is clean, elſe you would be offended, and ſhould not your Heart be clean? If not, would not your God be offended?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Author of this Ordinanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is a <hi>God of infinite Jealouſie,</hi> and he is moſt jealous in the matters of his Worſhip. In the Second Command, which ſets forth the manner of Gods<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Worſhip, he makes himſelf known by this Attribute, That he is a <hi>jealous</hi> God; and if his Jealouſie ſhould be kindled againſt you at his Table, it would be uncomfortable, it will be terrible to you.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Author of this Ordinance is an
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:000909_0054_0FACA1756FEF6878"/>
                  <hi>Omniſcient God,</hi> and cannot be deceived; if there be but one among a thouſand that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth unworthily, his eye will be upon him; he knows his Name, and ſees where he ſits, God knows the frame of your heart, he knows your end why you are there, and what your diligence was before you came; then come prepared.</p>
               <p>The third Argument for diligent preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is taken from the <hi>matter</hi> of this Sacrament: The more excellent and noble any thing is, the more hainous is the abuſe thereof. If a Servant brake and ſpoil ſome earthen Pitchers, his Maſter may more eaſily paſs it by, but if he take his Jewels, and his precious Pearls, and caſt them in the kennel, and bury them in the dunghil, he will be more difficultly pacified. If a man ſhall deal unjuſtly with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, it will be diſpleaſing unto God; but if he ſhall deal unworthily with his Son, he will be provoked: If you ſhould abuſe your common Bread and Drink, which God daily gives you for your ordinary repaſt and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, you commit a Soul-damning Sin; but if you prophane theſe ſpiritual dainties, without repentance, your damnation will be aggravated.</p>
               <p>Here you have to do with blood, and <hi>then</hi> if ever, you ſhould be ſerious; but moſt of all when it is the Blood of God. Conſider before you go, that you have <hi>to do with the Blood of Chriſt,</hi> and let that quicken you to preparation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:000909_0055_0FACA17625B2F0A0"/>The fourth Argument for diligent prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is from the <hi>ſubject</hi> that is to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of it; as we may be conſidered in a twofold ſtate or capacity.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>What we were.</item>

               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Every Man is born unfit for the Lords Table</hi>: We were Enemies to God, and therefore except we will come in our enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, we m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt prepare and fit our ſelves, by being reconciled unto God: We are <hi>born</hi> ſpiritually dead, and it would not be ſo loathſome a ſight to us to have a dead Corps full of plague ſores ſet down at our Table, as a man dead in Sin to ſit down at Gods Table, is loathſome unto God: <hi>Where there is no Life, there is no Appetite; and where there is no Appetite, there is no actual preparation to this duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Such as are <hi>truly converted, may yet be indiſpoſed for this duty</hi>; therefore there muſt be preparation. It is not every one that hath true grace, is preſently to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>actually</hi> fit for this Ordinance: As a man that is aſleep, is a living, real man, but yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Fifth Argument for Preparation, is taken from the <hi>Conſequents</hi> which will be anſwerable to our preparation, or neglect thereof, which will be either bad or good For though God doth not beſtow the great things in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>for</hi> our preparation, yet he will not give them <hi>without</hi> our preparation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The conſequents of coming unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red will be very dreadful.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Such do fearfully increaſe their guilt, in a very high degree,</hi> in making themſelves guilty of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, though not as an <hi>Actor</hi> in his death, yet virtually as an <hi>Abetter</hi> and <hi>Conſenter</hi>; for an <hi>unworthy Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is a Christ murderer,</hi> as he that defaceth the Kings Picture, doth reflect upon his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. He that dares ruſh upon the Sacrament with <hi>reigning-ſin</hi> in his heart, would be a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> unto Chriſt, if he were perſonally upon Earth; and had <hi>Judas</hi> his opportunity, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and other circumſtances, he would waſh his hands in the blood of Chriſt: that comes, but not to have his <hi>heart</hi> waſhed in the Sacrament, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. And will you

               <p>O what a crying Sin is <hi>Blood guiltineſs,</hi> tho' it be but the blood of a common man: But what will it be to be guilty of the Blood of the Son of God! Did not the Blood of <hi>Abel</hi> cry againſt <hi>Cain</hi> for vengeance? Oh what a <hi>voice</hi> and <hi>cry</hi> will there be then in the Blood of Chriſt! and will you have the Blood of Chriſt <hi>cry againſt</hi> you, inſtead of <hi>pleading for</hi> you? Nay, you will ſin more than many of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that did actually crucifie him, for many of them did it ignorantly; for had they known him, they could not have crucified the Lord of Glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. But you know and acknowledge him to be ſuch, and yet will be guilty of his Blood; they did it in his ſtate of humiliation, but you do it in his ſtate of Exaltation. It would have been better for <hi>Judas</hi> if he had not been born, and it would be better for you if you never had received.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such <hi>draw down great Judgments upon themſelves</hi>; and no wonder if great guilt and great ſin be followed with great Judgments; for God will proportion mens ſufferings to their ſinnings. <hi>He that cometh without the Wedding Garment on his Soul, ſhall go away with a Curſe upon his Head and Heart.</hi>

The ſame <hi>Red Sea</hi> that was Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> was death and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the <hi>Egyptians.

               <p>Eighth Argument, <hi>The many Duties that here in order are to be performed, and the many Graces that are here to be exerciſed, call for dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent preparation.</hi> If you were to perform a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe duties ſingly, which you are here to do joyntly, it is your duty to prepare for each of them.

                  <pb n="59" facs="unknown:000909_0066_0FACA17E62DC0AB0"/>1. <hi>It doth concern a man before he dye, to get the truth of Grace,</hi> that he have real Love to GOD, Faith in Chriſt, Peace with God thro' Chriſt, and without this a man cannot dye happily: This is as neceſſary for a man that is to come to the Lords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Supper, that he love God, that he do indeed believe and hate his ſins, or elſe he cannot receive worthily: Wo be to that man that goes down to his Grave before he be converted; and wo be to that man that comes to the Sacrament before he be born again.</p>

So a man, before he goes to the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſhould endeavour to get the knowledge, ſight and evidence of his intereſt in Chriſt, &amp; this is neceſſary to his more comfortable recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; without which, though he may receive worthily, yet not without ſome fears; <hi>I fear Christ did not dye for me, I fear this blood was not ſhed for me, I fear I do not love God</hi>; and ſo will be deprived of thoſe joyes and comforts which would come in by a particular applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt to himſelf; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with as great care as he would lye down in his Grave; and be as ſerious for his Soul at this Ordinance as he would upon his dying Bed: <hi>You ſhould go to the Lords Table, as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as if you were going into another World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But do you ſo? Tell me, if you had been to dye this day you come ſo receive, would you not have prayed more than you have done? Would you not have ſhed more tears for your ſins? would not more of your groans and ſighs have pierced the Heavens, and reached the ears of God? Would you not have ſearched your heart more narrowly? and paſſed ſentence upon your ſelf more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially? And been humbled more deeply? Would you not have ſaid, if I be miſtaken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the truth of Grace, now I am to dye, I am loſt for ever? And will you not ſay, if I be miſtaken about the truth of Grace, now I am to ſit down at the Lords Table, without my ſerious Repentance, I am undone for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? And inſtead of having the pardon of my ſin ſealed to my Soul, by my unworthy going, I bind the guilt of all my former ſins upon my Soul, as if the other were not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then great enough. I have added this to all the reſt, in making my ſelf guilty of the blood of Chriſt.</p>

That ſo much of your precious time is gone, and ſo little of your neceſſary work is done? Let that cauſe trouble to your heart, and fetch ears from your eyes, when you are at the Lords Table.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What Mercy is it you would beg from God if now you were dying?</hi> O beg that mercy when you are receiving; if you were dying, would you ask for Riches, or for Honours, or the great things of this World? alas, theſe would not fit you for your death; or would it be the truth of grace, the favour of God, aſſurance of his love, an intereſt in Chriſt, in his Promiſes, in his Priviledges, and an evidence of your title to his Kingdom? Would you not then wiſh, O that God would pardon me, and tell me he hath pardoned me! Oh that he would now be mine, and own me for his own! would not theſe be your deſires if you were to dye?</p>
               <p>Deſire the ſame when you are to receive

Theſe things will not fit you for receiving no more than for dying: If you were to dye, would you deſire to be thought godly, rather than be ſo indeed? What if one ſhould think you dye with grace in your heart, and you do not? and what if others ſhould think you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive with grace in your heart, and do not; neither of theſe would do you real good: beg then the ſame things when you receive, as you would if you were to die.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>What mercy is there you would eſpecially bleſs God for, if you were to dye?</hi> Give thanks to God for that mercy when you do <hi>receive</hi>: If you were to die, would you chiefly bleſs God for making of you rich and great in the world? or for making of you truly good and holy towards God? would you not upon a dying Bed bleſs God for Chriſt, for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of your ſins, and for the hopes you have of an eternal bleſſed life? give thanks to God for theſe, with as great reality at the Lords Table, as if you were going to the Bar of God from a dying Bed.</p>

If Chriſt had been with you in your Cloſet, when you were upon your knees, would you not have prayed more earneſtly, and wept more abundantly than you did? If Chriſt had been with you the night before, &amp; ſeen you look more into your Shop-Book, than into the Book of God, and the Book of your Heart, and ſeen you turn over the leaves of your Books of Account, and not the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of your life; and been with you when you were more buſie in cleanſing of your Houſe, than of your Heart? would you not have bluſhed to look him in the face at his Table? Why, Chriſt <hi>as God,</hi> was really with you, when you were preparing of your heart, and took ſpecial notice of your diligence, or remiſneſs in that work. He is with you in the morning before you go, he obſerves what time you riſe, what time you ſpend, what pains you take in order to this duty: And though they be poor, mortal, ſinful men, that do admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter this Ordinance to you in Chriſts Name and ſtead, yet he requires you ſhould be as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as if he himſelf were viſibly preſent; for as he is God, he is really preſent: And will you not reverence and dread Chriſt as God, as much as you would Chriſt as Man? The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Feaſt doth ſurely come and view his Gueſts, and if there were one Hypocrite among a thouſand Receivers, he would know him by name, and fix his eye upon him, and

ſay, <hi>Friend, What make you here amongſt my people, when you have not that love to me as they have, nor take that pains to prepare your ſelf as they have done? Mark</hi> 22.11, 12, 13. He did ſay, this is the <hi>Judas</hi> that will betray me; and he will ſay, This is the man that profanes my Table; this is the woman that abuſes my Blood: Think of this when you are to come unto this duty, and this dignity, to be a Gueſt at this Table of the Lord.</p>

               <p>Ninthly, For want of this Reflection after the Sacrament, <hi>you will be a grief to the Spirit of God,</hi> whether you did meet with God or no; whether it was well or ill with you when you were there; <hi>If you did meet with God,</hi> and if he did comfort your heart, or humble you for ſin, and do not reflect, you grieve the Spirit of God, that he was ſo kind and loving unto you, and you ſo ſoon forget it, to be thankful for it; <hi>If you did not meet with God,</hi> and do not reflect, you grieve the Spirit, that though he abſented himſelf from your Soul, you do ſoon forget it to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for it.</p>

               <p>Twelfthly, It argues <hi>you are not ſo wiſe for your Soul, as you are for your Body</hi>; not ſo wiſe for the things of Heaven, as for the things of this world; for after you have been trading for the things of this Life, you will caſt up your accounts to ſee what are your gains, and what is added to your ſtock.</p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, This <hi>will provoke God in after-duties to withdraw from you,</hi> and to deny that to you in following Ordinances, which you would not ſo much as enquire whether you had got in former Duties.</p>
               <p>Fourteenthly, <hi>You may decline in Grace, and be on the loſing hand, and not eaſily and quickly perceive it,</hi> and fall into a frame of dulneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are aware.</p>

               <p>THE Reaſons why ſome are not the better by going to the Lords Table, are ſuch as theſe:</p>

<pb n="141" facs="unknown:000909_0142_0FACA13DE1947368"/>
They that have not firſt received a <hi>whole</hi> Chriſt in the Goſpel in all his Office<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All the benefit that muſt come in by the Sacrament, muſt be by the exerciſe of grace, of faith, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Secondly, Becauſe <hi>many that are habitually prepared, may be too ſlight in actual preparation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And God will check you at his Table, by withdrawing himſelf from you, for your neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect before you came?

               <p>Fourthly, Becauſe <hi>God is offended that ſome ſweet and ſecret ſin is too much ſavoured</hi>

And I ſent Meſsengers to him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I am doing a great work, ſo that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come down; Why ſhould the work ceaſe, while I leave it and come to you? Yet they ſent unto me four times after that ſort, and I anſwered them after the ſame manner.</hi> When you are receiving, the Devil would parley with you, but it is to do you miſchief, therefore reply unto him, I am doing a great work, ſo that I have no time to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain thy ſuggeſtions O mine enemy! I have other things to think upon; here is the death of my Lord, and his love in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for me, to think upon; and why ſhould this work ceaſe, while I entertain thy ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions? So far as your thoughts wander, ſo far your work at the Lords Table ſtands ſtill. And if Satan ſolicit you four or more times, ſtill anſwer after the ſame manner; be as conſtant in reſiſting, as he is in ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and you will find benefit by the duty, if you ply your work when you are there.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Becauſe <hi>you have not conſcientiouſly endeavoured to live up to reſolutions made in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer receivings.</hi> Did you not there promiſe, if God would pleaſe to manifeſt himſelf unto you, and warm your heart, and pardon your

That you would pray more, and pray better; That you would take heed of after-paſſion, if God would pardon your former paſſion? And yet you have come ſhort of all this, not only through unavoidable infirmity, but through careleſsneſs and letting down your Spiritual Watch. When the Temptation hath aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you again, you have quietly yielded again, and God hath ſeen as much uncircumſpection in your Converſation as before; and do you think the next time you do receive, that God will not make you go away without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of this Ordinance, who deny to him the care of your converſation? If you would have God to do you good by his Ordinances, you muſt walk ſo holily, when one Ordinance is over, that you may meet with God in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or in the ſame at another time.</p>
