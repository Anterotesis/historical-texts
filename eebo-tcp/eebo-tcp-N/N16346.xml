            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I TAKE the earlieſt opportunity of letting you know, how much I have ſuffered by the peruſal of your travels, and I think it neceſſary to make this declaration public. I have a very cogent reaſon for ſo doing. They, in many places, contain errors, and, I will venture to ſay, a poiſon, which, under your name, will have a rapid circulation; and to which we cannot be too haſty in applying an antidote.</p>
            <p>A poiſon! You may ſtart at the expreſſion; but I can neither ſuppreſs or ſoften it, as it is ſo preciſely characteriſtic of your opinions reſpecting the Quakers, the Negroes, and the People.</p>
            <p>In vilifying the Quakers, you may prevent the good effects of their pious example. In refuſing the name of men to the Negroes, you give your ſanction to the treating them like beaſts of burthen, if not to the ſpilling of their blood; and you hinder the effects of that philoſophical commotion, which will no doubt procure their general emancipation. In making the People contemptible, you invite their oppreſſors to rivet their chains. Theſe are matters of great
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:020981_0003_0FB1695EFA5E7970"/>
importance.—They will juſtify me to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, for having taken up my pen in ſo precipitate a manner; they will juſtify me, even in your eyes, for having uſed it againſt yourſelf: your reaſon will undoubtedly plead for me, in oppoſition to your feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and you will pardon me for having publiſhed truths, perhaps diſagreeable ones for you, when I ſhall have convinced you, that they are of public uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and not to be ſuppreſſed. <hi>Amicus Plato ſed magis ami<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a veritas.</hi> This ſhould be the motto of every writer who has really the public good at heart.</p>
            <p>I do not mean, in this place, to criticiſe your book throughout.—Let the journaliſts point out the <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of your ſtile.—My buſineſs is to obviate the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous tendency of your work, without paying any attention to the elegance of the language. I ſhould, indeed, have been better pleaſed, if you had not ſhewn ſo much uneaſineſs about getting a bad ſupper, or ſo muc h pleaſure from having made a good one; and could have diſpenſed with the exact detail you have given us of every diſh; for it is not the journal of an Apicius, but that of a philoſopher and ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which we expect to read, when we ſee the name of the author of <hi>La Felicité Publique</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">An excellent treatiſe, (allowing for a few errors.) attributed to the MARQUIS de CHATELLUX, and which I have commended in ſeveral of my writings.</note> in the title page.—I ſhould have been better pleaſed if your obſervations had not been confined to taverns, and if you had not ſacrificed our American friends to the pleaſure of making jeſts.—Alas! what will be the opinion of thoſe whom you have thus offended, when they read your book—and how can we expect a friendly reception from them, when they find their ſecrets betrayed, and the unreſerved effuſions of the heart ridiculed by a man decorated with ſo many ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles? What confidence will they now place in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Frenchman? On his firſt approach, the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can will exclaim—are you alſo come to ſpy out our follies, and publiſh them to Europe?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:020981_0004_0FB1696170985690"/>It would have been ſatisfactory to have ſeen more penetration in your enquiries concerning the effects of the different political conſtitutions of America.— I could have wiſhed for ſome account of the number of criminals; of the crimes which are moſt frequent; of the difference of morals in the cities, in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and in the newly ſettled parts; of the ſtate of the finances, &amp;c. and I ſhould alſo have been better pleaſed, if, inſtead of railing at democracies, you had ſummed up grievances and well atteſted facts.— But this is not a proper place for the diſcuſſion of theſe intereſting ſubjects.</p>
            <p>The principal charges, I bring againſt you, may be reduced to three:</p>
            <p n="1">I. You have calumniated and ridiculed the reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſect of Quakers.</p>
            <p n="2">II. You have vilified the Negroes.</p>
            <p n="3">III. You have vilified Mankind and the People.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the three general charges againſt you, which I now lay before the tribunal of the Public.— After having diſcuſſed them, I ſhall add ſome reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on ſeveral other ſubjects you have treated of, which appear to me equally ſuſceptible of cenſure.</p>
            <p>In making this examination, I ſhall, firſt of all, quote your opinions and aſſertions, and then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to refute them.</p>
            <p>I begin with the article concerning the Quakers.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>
                  <hi>VINDICATION</hi> of the <hi>QUAKERS.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <q>Inſtead of their company, we had that of Mr. Benezet, an old Quaker, whoſe ſhort ſtature, and low, <hi>mean</hi> figure, formed a <hi>perfect</hi> contraſt to Mr. Pendleton's. This Mr. Benezet may be looked on rather as a model of what the Quakers ought to be than as a ſpecimen of what they are.—As his only object was the good of others, his charity and generoſity made him greatly reſpected in thoſe more happy times, when a citizen derived all his honor from his virtues. Now the din of arms has drowned the ſighs of charity, and the love of our
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:020981_0005_0FB1696379EE8160"/>
fellow creatures yields to patriotiſm. Yet Mr. Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet ſtill continues in the practice of doing good. He came to get ſome information from me, on the means lately found out in France, of reſtoring drowned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to life. I promiſed, not only to ſend him an account of the methods uſed in thoſe caſes, when I returned to Newport, but alſo to procure him one of the boxes which our government has ordered to be placed at every ſea-port town. We ſoon got bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted; and, ſpeaking of the misfortunes of war, he ſaid to me,—My Friend, I know thou art a man of letters, and a member of the French academy. Several good things have lately been writen by men of letters; they have attacked errors and prejudices, and eſpecially intolerance: Will not they try to give men a diſtaſte for war, and make them live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether like friends and brethren? Thou art right, ſaid I, in expecting ſomething from the progreſs of philoſophical knowledge. Several active hands are now at work upon the great edifice of public good; but it will be to no purpoſe for them to finiſh any part of it, while the foundation is wanting, and this foundation is, as thou haſt ſaid, a general peace. As to intolerance and perſecution, it is true, that thoſe two enemies of mankind are not yet ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently chained down; but let me whiſper a word in thy ear, the full meaning of which thou wilt not perhaps comprehend, though thou art well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the French language. They are no longer <hi>faſhionable;</hi> and, I ſhould even think, they were nearly <hi>out of date,</hi> were it not for ſome little matters thou art unacquainted with: which is, that thoſe who attack them are ſometimes impriſoned, while their defenders are rewarded with livings of an hundred thouſand livres a year. An hundred thouſand livres a year! cries Benezet, why, with that they might build hoſpitals, and ſet up manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factories; and, to be ſure, that's what they do with their money. No, my friend, ſaid I, perſecution muſt be paid for; and yet, I muſt ſay, the pay is
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:020981_0006_0FB169650320CFD0"/>
but mean, and the higheſt price given by the richeſt perſecutor, is no more than one thouſand, or twelve hundred livres a year, to ſome ſatirical poets, or writers of journals, who are enemies to lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, and whoſe works are much read, tho' they have but a dull ſale. Friend, ſays the Quaker to me, this perſecution is a ſtrange thing; I can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe what has happened to myſelf. My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was a Frenchman born, and ſo am I. It is now about ſixty years ſince he was obliged to ſeek an aſylum in England, carrying with him his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the only treaſures which he could ſave in his misfortunes. Juſtice, or what is called ſo in thy country, had him hung in effigy, becauſe he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the Goſpel in a different way from your prieſts. The Engliſh clergy gave my father but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more ſatisfaction, ſo that he wiſhed to get away from all hierarchy, and came to ſettle in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where I have lived very happily until the breaking out of the war. I have long ſince forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten all the perſecutions my family have undergone. I love thy nation, becauſe it is a mild and a feeling one; and for thee, my friend, I know thou doſt every thing in thy power to ſerve thy fellow creatures. When thou returneſt to Europe, get thy brethren to aſſiſt thee:—and let me now recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our friends in Rhode-Iſland to thy attention. He then named all the Quakers who live in that ſtate, and are pretty numerous; and recommended them to my care. At parting, he aſked leave to ſend me ſome pamphlets of his <hi>own manufacturing,</hi> written chiefly in defence of his ſect. I aſſured him, <hi>it would give me great pleaſure to read them;</hi> and he did not fail to ſend them next morning.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Of whatever ſect a man, glowing with zeal and love for his fellow creatures, may be, he is moſt undoubtedly a reſpectable being; but, I confeſs, I cannot beſtow on this ſect in general, the eſteem which ſome individuals of it are entitled to. The law, which many of them follow, of not ſaying
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020981_0007_0FB169667B522070"/>
                     <hi>you,</hi> nor <hi>ſir, is far from giving them an air of plainneſs or candor.</hi> It is perhaps to make up for this clown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs, that they often ſpeak in a <hi>whining, inſinuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> tone, which is perfectly <hi>jeſuitical.</hi> Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct too, is quite of a piece with their language. Concealing <hi>their indifference for the public good,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the appearance of religion, they are ſparing of blood, it is true, and <hi>eſpecially of their own;</hi> they are mere ſharpers at <hi>cheating</hi> both parties out of their money, and that <hi>without a bluſh,</hi> or the leaſt regard to what may be thought of them. It is a received maxim in trade, that they are not to be truſted. This opinion is a juſt one, and time will more and more ſhew the propriety of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Indeed, nothing can be more dangerous than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm in its decline; for hypocriſy is the only ſubſtitute that can be found for it. This monſter, ſo well known in Europe, gains but too much ground in every religious ſect.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>On Sunday, the 10th, I determined to <hi>take a turn thro' the churches, and ſtudy the different modes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> Unfortunately for me, the ſeveral ſects, who agree in nothing elſe, have fixed on the ſame hour for aſſembling their congregations; ſo that I could only go to the Quaker's meeting-houſe in the morning, and to the church of England in the afternoon. The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's meeting is a ſquare room, in every part of which, and parallel to the four walls, are benches and deſks, ſo that they ſit oppoſite to one another; without altar or pulpit to fix their attention. When they are met, ſome one of their elders makes an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore</hi> prayer, juſt what comes into his head; they are then ſilent, 'till ſome man or woman is inſpired, and gets up to ſpeak. Travellers muſt be believed on their words, let the account they give be ever ſo extraordinary. Like Arioſto, I ſhall relate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies —<hi>dirò maraviglia.</hi> It is nevertheleſs true, that a woman <hi>held her tongue</hi> juſt as I came in. A man took her place, and ſpoke <hi>like a blockhead on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal grace, the illumination of the Spirit, and all the

other tenets of his ſect,</hi> which <hi>he had over and over again,</hi> without attempting to explain any thing. He at length got to the end of his ſermon, to the great joy of his brethren and ſiſters, who all appeared abſent and tired out.

                  <q>On leaving this <hi>gloomy</hi> and <hi>clowniſh</hi> meeting, the ſervice of the church of England, with the muſic and ornaments, ſeemed like an <hi>opera.</hi> An <hi>handſome</hi> pulpit, placed before a <hi>fine</hi> organ, a <hi>well-dreſſed</hi> miniſter in the pulpit, reading, ſpeaking, and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>with a grace perfectly theatrical;</hi> the young women, <hi>from the pit and boxes,</hi> joining him with their melodious voices; a ſoft and agreeable ſinging, interrupted by ſome excellent airs on the organ; all this, compared to the worſhip of the Quakers, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, and Preſbyterians, ſeemed rather a little Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, than the road to Paradiſe. However, by reflecting on ſo many different ſects, ſome of whom are rigid, and ſome trifling, but every one imperious and narrow, one is lead to believe, that all mankind read the great book of nature, as <note n="*" place="bottom">Montauciel is the name of an ignorant ſoldier, one of the characters in the Deſerter, a comic opera. He engages the Deſerter to teach him to read. He gets a bit of paper in his hand, on which the words, <hi>vous etes un blanc bee,</hi> are written, and on ſpelling the letters, he makes out <hi>trompette bleſſée.</hi> The Deſerter ſhews him his miſtake, and the word <hi>blanc bee</hi> (ſimpleton) becomes the ſource of altercation.</note>

of your ſatire requires, I ſhall make bold to aſk you, Sir, what facts, books, or men, have authoriſed you to condemn this ſect ſo haſtily? Have you known a great number, or the generality of Quakers? Have you lived a long time in habits of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy with them? Can you form a judgment of them all, and know the worth of the whole ſociety, from having been at one or two of their meetings? or from having converſed with one or two of them in a haſty manner? or from having been introduced to one who did not think fit to look at you? When you went into that religious meeting, where you formed a judgment of the diſcourſe, or prayer which you heard, were you in a proper ſtate of mind for the ſincere inveſtigation of truth? Had you no prejudices againſt the Quakers? and your theatrical knowledge too, which brought ridicule into your head, this ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule which is ſo powerful an argument for a French Man; did not this ſame knowledge ſpread a veil over your mind—Have you not been prejudiced againſt the Quakers by Voltaire, who has by turns, praiſed them and endeavoured to make them appear ridiculous, though he knew but little of them? And indeed, who would not at firſt ſight, regard your teſtimony as ſuſpicious, and your judgment as partial, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering your moral and religious opinions, your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of academician, ſoldier and man of quality, that three fold character, which this ſociety ſo juſtly deteſt.</p>
               <p>And why have you, in forming a judgment of them, abandoned thoſe principles by which our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould ever be directed—We have no right to cenſure any one, unleſs we have either ourſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected him violating the laws of honour and probity, or upon the authentic and impartial teſtimony of others on his crime. Vague reports ought never to have any weight.</p>
               <p>To condemn a whole body of men at once, a ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of long ſtanding, to accuſe them of cheating, of ſelfiſhneſs, and hypocriſy, requires a ſeries of well
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020981_0010_0FB1696DCBFC4490"/>
atteſted facts, the truth of which is of the greater conſequence, as the charges are ſerious, and involve ſo many people in them.</p>
               <p>Thus, ſhould any one charge the Catholics with hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been perſecutors, they might prove it by their Autos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da-fé, their inquiſition, Saint Bartholomew's day, the Iriſh maſſacre, &amp;c. To prove that the Puritans of former times were perſecutors, we need only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the tragical ſcenes which were acted during the revolution of 1650 in England, and the perſecutions they excited in the new world.—To prove the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, intriguing and perſecuting ſpirit of the Jeſuits, we have only to refer to their unceaſing manoeuvres in England and France, the deſtruction of Port-Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and the many lettres de cachet, which they have made uſe of to deſtroy, in ſecret priſons, a crowd of victims, whoſe only fault was a different way of thinking—Theſe are facts well atteſted.</p>
               <p>But have you, Sir, any ſuch facts to allege againſt the Quakers? not a ſingle one—So far from that, you produce none but what are in their favour—For I ſhall now and then have the ſatisfaction of making uſe of your own words to refute you.</p>
               <p>But it is becauſe you bring no poſitive charge of any crime againſt the Quakers; it is becauſe you judge them only by hear-ſay and vague reports, that I conclude you have no proof of the vices and crimes you reproach them with; and that your judgment of them is unjuſt.</p>
               <p>I will not, however, confine myſelf to this general method of reaſoning, but will follow you ſtep by ſtep— I believe your reflections on the Quakers may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to three principle heads; they affect</p>
               <p>Either their moral and private conduct,</p>
               <p>Their religious tenets,</p>
               <p>Or their civil principles—</p>

                  <q>Simplicity, candor and honeſty, characterized their words and actions; they were not full of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, but ſincere; they were not poliſhed, but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane; they had no wit—none of that wit ſo eſſential in France, and which there ſupplies the place of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing elſe; but they poſſeſſed good ſenſe, ſound judgments, upright hearts and honeſt ſouls; in a word, if I were to ſeek for ſociety, it ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Quakers; if I ſought for amuſement, I would have recourſe to my own countrymen—And their women too, I ſhall be aſked, what can be ſaid of them?

which is due to his teſtimony. He lived for a long time in America, and lived with Quakers; he has been intimate with them, has attended to, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely conſidered their behaviour in civil life, and his opinion of them is wholly different from yours<note n="†" place="bottom">See the American Farmer's Letters, Vol. 1ſt. from page 137, to 197, and the anecdote in the Preface.</note>— With what warmth does he praiſe the ſimple and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial hoſpitality he met with in their houſes, and the peace and happineſs which reigned there—<hi>"Every thing there is done in ſilence, and with cheerfulneſs"</hi> How does he praiſe the good ſenſe, the ſagacity, the temperance, the ſoftneſs and the education of their women.

                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:020981_0014_0FB169734146B4B8"/>And you, Sir, wiſh to deſtroy this enchantment— By your ſilence you contradict all I have ſaid. Cruel man! If it was an illuſion, how could you wiſh to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive us? It was dear to us, as it ſerved to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the conſolation of the good, and the remorſe of the wicked—But no, it is no illuſion—they are truths, they are facts, which you are combating; you who have ſeen America only in her camps, amidſt the din of arms, and in one of thoſe violent revolutions, where man, thrown out of his ſphere, is no longer himſelf, and can neither form a right judgment of things, nor is he a proper ſubject for the judgment of others; you who have obtained your knowledge of America only by flying through it, by ſtopping at taverns, and perhaps now and then going to a ball, or tea-party; you, to contradict a native of America, a farmer who gives his opinion, after twenty-five years of obſervations, made at his leiſure in the midſt of peace, confidence and friendſhip!</p>
               <p>And what are the weapons you make uſe of? Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean and national prejudices. You have no facts on your ſide, and this reſpectable man has many; they are well authenticated, and the names he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions well known. He quotes a Benezet, a Mifflin, a Bartram, and you, with all your talking of hypocrites and cheats, you name nobody. How then can we give credit to your aſſertions?</p>
               <p>In my opinion you deſerve a very ſevere reproof for ſuch conduct—When one author attacks the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of another, he ſhould quote him, name him, and appeal to the public deciſion: Nothing but the deſpicable character of our opponent can excuſe ſuch an omiſſion—Now, you have publiſhed opinions and aſſertions, directly in contradiction to thoſe of St. John de Crevecoeur, and you have not ſaid a ſingle ſyllable of him, nor of his book; a book too which has enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the public attention, and yet you have read it.— You well know how much the author is eſteemed in America, and you yourſelf have expreſſed your perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al eſteem for him. Since you attack, not merely
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020981_0015_0FB169761DEAEF80"/>
his opinions, but his narrations and his facts; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon politeneſs, attention and reſpect for the public, did then, and ſtill do, require, that you give your reaſons for not mentioning him, and for differing from him in ſentiment.</p>
               <p>Who then ſhall we give credit to, concerning the Quakers? to St. John de Crevecoeur, or to the Marquis de Chatellux? one praiſes, the other traduces them: theſe are queſtions I have often heard, and which you ought to have prevented; but by not mentioning this author's name, nor his book, you have thrown the public into a ſtate of uncertainty on theſe points.</p>
               <p>I know very well, that this treacherous, jeſuitical ſilence, which Academicians and men of the world are ſo well acquainted with, is honored with the name of conſideration and reſpect. The means of ruining a public character, by general remarks, or by not ſaying any thing at all of him, is a ſecret many are well acquainted with; but believe me, this cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly practice of our literary ariſtocracy, in no-wiſe becomes you. The motto of every honeſt writer ſhould be, <hi>When I attack any one, I do it from motives of duty, and do it openly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The public cannot long remain in the ſtate of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty you have thrown them into, if they will but attend to the arguments I have already brought to controvert your opinions, and to thoſe I ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after produce. The difference in your manner of writing is againſt you. If I were even unacquainted with St. John de Crevecoeur, if I had not been on the moſt intimate footing with him, I could give my judgment after having read over both your books; his is a work of the heart, your's ſhews that you have a great deal of wit; but republicans, pure moraliſts, ſuch as the Quakers, muſt be judged by the heart; their reputation will receive no ſhock from all the art you have made uſe of to injure them.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now begin to follow you ſtep by ſtep.</p>
               <p>The law which you ſay, <hi>many</hi> of them obſerve, of ſaying neither <hi>You,</hi> nor <hi>Sir,</hi> is far from giving them
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020981_0016_0FB16977C76278F0"/>
an <hi>air</hi> of ſimplicity and candor. This is not the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of <hi>many,</hi> but of <hi>all</hi> the ſociety.</p>
               <p>You ſpeak of an <hi>air,</hi> as if the Quakers aſſumed any <hi>airs;</hi> as if their plainneſs was but affectation. They are much above it; the plainneſs of their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage conſiſts in renouncing thoſe empty forms, thoſe ridiculous compliments and faſhionable falſhoods which French politeneſs requires; it is on this plainneſs the Quakers value themſelves; they do not tell a ſtranger that they are charmed to ſee him; they keep ſilence at the firſt interview, and wait for an opportunity of forming a judgment; they do not ſqueeze the hand of a man whom they deſpiſe; they do not bow to a fine ſuit of clothes, a croſs, or a red or blue ribband; they do not pay court to a miniſter, who is deteſted by the nation—If they <hi>thee</hi> and <hi>thou</hi> every body, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe all men are equal; are not theſe ſufficient reaſons for a Philoſopher?</p>
               <p>The undaunted manner in which they have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported this cuſtom at court, and at the bar; that boldneſs which has conſtrained thoſe in authority to give way to them, will not even this entitle them to your praiſe? For admitting with you, that it is a matter of indifference to ſay <hi>you</hi> or <hi>thou</hi> to a ſingle perſon, yet it muſt be of importance, to have a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and to poſſeſs a degree of firmneſs, of that unſhaken firmneſs, which is ſo hateful to oppreſſors, becauſe they dread the conſequences of it; and, it matters not, that this firmneſs appears in ſmall things, and trifling circumſtances; for there is no doubt, but it will be called forth with greater energy, on more important occaſions. Now, the perſecutions which the Quakers have undergone, for not giving up their <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou,</hi> ſhew a greatneſs of character, and of conſequence a ſuperiority over the reſt of mankind, which they have ever ſuſtained, when their civil or religious principles have been attacked by govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But after all, as to this cuſtom of theirs, which you find ſo much fault with, let us ſee whether they or the men of the world are in the right: ſince <hi>You</hi> takes in ſeveral perſons, why make uſe of it to one
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020981_0017_0FB16979403DBCB0"/>
only? adulation firſt invented this corrupt practice, and pride and baſeneſs of ſoul have brought it into general uſe: The Quakers wiſh to reſtore the cuſtoms of propriety, and what objections can you make to them? muſt they limp becauſe you are not ſtrong enough to walk upright?</p>
               <p>If our ſelf-conceited literati, and would-be philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, had really any philoſophy about them, would not they imitate the Quakers? Would they not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce thoſe mean ceremonies, which ſhow the ſlaviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and falſhood of mankind? Would they not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ridicuiling the Quakers, endeavour, like them to exalt human nature, and compel the great to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the loweſt of their fellow creatures is their equal: This was the conduct of Diogenes, the hero of our Academicians, whoſe example however they will not follow; Diogenes in this reſpect acted like a true Quaker, that is to ſay, like a wiſe man, who knew the dignity of man, and the inſignificancy of thoſe diſtinctions which we meet with in civil life.</p>
               <p>And I would be glad to know too, what meaning you affix to the word <hi>candor,</hi> which you ſay the Quakers make uſe of as a blind? To have <hi>candor,</hi> is to ſpeak unreſervedly from the very heart, which muſt be pure for ſuch a purpoſe—To have <hi>candor</hi> is to ſpeak what you think, and to pay the ſtricteſt attention to truth. This is the general character of the Quakers, and it is a character they have obtained by the ſacrifice of their lives.</p>
               <p>But you think very differently; for you charge them with a <hi>whining, inſinuating tone, which is perfectly jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itical;</hi> you ſay too, <hi>that their conduct is quite of a piece.</hi> Horrid and falſe compariſon! what do we mean by a Jeſuit? a deceiver, with the air of candor, an art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hypocrite, one who is ambitious and plotting, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the appearance of renouncing honors and riches; a tyrant with an air of ſoftneſs, ſubjection and polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and one who pretends to be humane, and yet is wholly given to ſelfiſhneſs.</p>
               <p>The Jeſuits were inflamed with a deſire of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering over the the conſciences of men, that they might
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:020981_0018_0FB1697AC75818B0"/>
rule kingdoms, open priſons by their nod, and bury alive their rivals and their enemies—this was <hi>their</hi> reaſon for affecting a <hi>whining inſinuating tone,</hi> which hurts no one's vanity, but flatters and miſleads it.</p>
               <p>The Jeſuits raged with the deſire of making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, they beſieged the growing talents of the youth, and bent them to their own purpoſes; they over-reached great and ſmall; they had ſpies at court, and at the bar; they had their puffers and partiſans in pay. In ſhort they were for attempting and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing every thing.</p>
               <p>I would aſk any one, who knows any thing of the Quakers, who has lived ever ſo ſhort a time amongſt them, whether any part of this character ſuits this plain people? can they, who renounce all places and honors, be charged with the luſt of power? can they, who have no ambition, be called plotters? ſhould they be ſuppoſed deceitful, without any motives for being ſo? does not the whole world know, that they do not attempt to make proſelytes! that they do not ſeek for praiſe, either by writing or flattery! every body knows that they deteſt intolerance, and, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, thoſe horrid methods which are practiſed on perſons in confinement, thoſe private tortures and inquiſitions which the Jeſuits made uſe of to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the doctrine of the <hi>efficacy of grace.</hi> The Quakers have been often derided, mutilated, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned; they have never treated their enemies in ſuch a manner; can the ſame be ſaid of the Jeſuits?</p>
               <p>Is there any thing extraordinary in this ſoftneſs of their manners? does it not naturally accompany their love of humanity, and principles of univerſal tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? there is nothing in it characteriſtic of the inſinuating ſharper; his ſchemes are for the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of power, riches, fame or titles; but the true Quaker ſeeks not for power, he is of all men the leaſt deſirous of wealth, he cares little for a name, and deſpiſes all marks of diſtinction.</p>
               <p>But you are not ſatisfied with denying them all pretenſions to plainneſs and candor; you are not
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020981_0019_0FB1697C8EAAA380"/>
ſatisfied with comparing them to one of the moſt ambitious, plotting, and tyrannical ſects that ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted —but you will not even allow them to poſſeſs common honeſty. You tell us, that during the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican war, they cheated both parties out of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, without a bluſh, and careleſs of what might be thought of their conduct.</p>
               <p>And yet you bring no proof in ſupport of ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere an accuſation: an accuſation which affects the whole ſociety; which affects their Benezets and Mifflins: men whom you praiſe, and whom the lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of virtue will admire. How could you, thus in a moment, endeavour to diſgrace ſo many reſpectable characters? And even admitting, what I neither can nor will believe, till you prove it by well-atteſted facts—admitting, I ſay, that there were ſome Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who took advantage of the times, to ſell at exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant prices, or, as you expreſs it, to cheat both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties out of their money, was it well done in you, to throw the odium on the whole ſociety? If any amongſt them are culpable, name them; it is your duty to do ſo. You, yourſelf are culpable if you do not; for, indeed, by your ſilence, you involve both the innocent and guilty in the charge.</p>
               <p>But as you never could have known the Quaker's methods of dealing; as you never could, nor ever will be able to prove, that they are all cheats, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, it follows that your aſſertions are downright defamation; for which you ought to make amends at the public tribunal, where you have unfair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly traduced them. At this tribunal, I now impeach you. I, who have been well acquainted with ſome Quakers, and am fully convinced of the general probity of their ſociety, and obſerving, that they are accuſed by a man of rank and quality, and member of ſeveral academies—conſiderations which might lead the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic to doubt of the honeſty of the Quakers, I ſummons you to produce your charges, and your proofs before the public; and if you are ſtill ſilent, let me once more repeat it, I ſhall think myſelf authorized to treat your aſſertions as mere defamation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:020981_0020_0FB1697DC7681A58"/>This word will ſhock you, ſir; I uſe it with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret; but I do not uſe it without having ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended to the meaning of it. A defamatory work, is one which is made public, in which an avowed or anonymous author, injures one or more perſons, by accuſing them, falſly, of crimes, meanneſſes or vices; or, in a word, ſtrives to injure their character. Now, do not you accuſe the Quakers of being ſharpers, cheats, hypocrites, and men careleſs of the public good?</p>
               <p>We will ſuppoſe the Quakers may have furniſhed the Engliſh, as well as the Americans, with proviſions. Do you call that a crime? You ſhould recollect that the Quakers look on all men as their brethren, and that no one is their enemy, not even their perſecutors. In this point of view, Engliſh and Americans were the ſame to them. The greateſt part of them thought that England was carrying on an unjuſt war. But the Quakers did not look on the Heſſians as part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in this act of injuſtice, they thought them equally entitled to their aſſiſtance with their American brethren.</p>
               <p>According to my preſent ſentiments that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtifiable war, is that which is carried on to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt oppreſſion, and that the American war was of this kind, I muſt confeſs I ſhould have been better pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if the Quakers had joined the Americans, that they might the ſooner have got rid of the deſtroyers of their country.</p>
               <p>But ſince they have not done ſo, ſince they have ſcrupulouſly adhered to their principles, of not ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding blood, I cannot accuſe them of any thing crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and the leſs ſo, becauſe their principles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct were known before hand, to both parties <note n="*" place="bottom">The Author of his work, propoſes, in a future publication on the the Quakers, to examine into the truth of this charge. And at the ſame time, to take notice of the freſh complaints, made againſt them, by M. Mazzei, Author of <hi>Recherches ſur les Etats Unis,</hi> which he has engaged to do, in his Anſwer to this Writer, already publiſhed.</note>.</p>
               <p>And we will ſuppoſe alſo that they may have ſold their goods at a high price to both parties. But do you call this cheating? In diſcuſſing this charge, I ſhould be
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:020981_0021_0FB1698079306950"/>
glad of well ſtated facts. But, as there are none, for you have not furniſhed me with any, I muſt ſuppoſe, that you have been led away, by the common prejudice, againſt the merchant who takes the benefit of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to ſell at an advanced price.</p>
               <p>When any trade is free, not in the hands of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, when the buyer is not forced to give what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever price may be demanded, there can be no cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not even if they ſold at the moſt extravagant rates.</p>
               <p>The natural conſequence of a war, is to raiſe the price of goods very high, becauſe produce is leſſened, and goods become ſcarce. The ſeller is then no more culpable for raiſing the price on account of the ſcarcity, than the buyer would be for offering a ſmall price in plentiful times. But the common people, who are uſed to fixed prices, and whoſe reſources are diminiſhed in time of war; this common people, who are then forced to buy every thing at a high price, exclaim that they are cheated. And I dare ſay, that a great many of our French officers, in their travels through the United States, have, as well as you, met with poor inns, and bad fare; and yet were obliged to pay a high price, for a mean lodging, and a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſupper. Theſe, I have no doubt, often thought themſelves impoſed upon, and looked upon all the American inn-keepers as cheats. And you, your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſeem to inſinuate as much in ſeveral places<note n="*" place="bottom">In one place amongſt many others, when ſpeaking of one BESSONET, (whom you miſtake for a brother of BENEZET's.) you ſay, that he retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed none of his Quaker principles, but that of ſelling at an extravagant price.</note>. But you and your brother officers were all wrong; For you paid, firſt, for the ſcarcity of hands, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive price of labour; ſecondly, for the ſcarcity of proviſions; thirdly, for the ſcarcity of travellers; and fourthly, for the ſcarcity of taverns; and, on theſe four different accounts, it is no wonder, if you paid four times as much as in France.</p>
               <p>I do not mean to lay before you, in this place, all
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:020981_0022_0FB169818955D8C8"/>
my opinions on high prices <note n="†" place="bottom">See my Sentiments on this ſubject, in the Chapter ſur l' Etat civil des Juiſs, in the ſecond Volume of the Journal du Licée ou Tableau des Sciences &amp; des Arts en Angleterre. I have there ſaid, that ſelling at a high price is often conſidered as a want of principle, at leaſt, by ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note>. I ſhall only ſay, that this can never be called cheating, as long as the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er knows the quality of the goods, and the conditions of ſale: ſecondly where there are many ſellers, the buyer is at liberty to purchaſe, or leave it alone.</p>
               <p>The Quakers have the name of ſelling at high rates, I ſuppoſe, becauſe their merchandiſe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of a good quality. But ſince you are at liberty to provide yourſelf elſewhere, you cannot complain of their ſelling dear; and if you give them the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, it muſt be becauſe you eſteem their goods, though of a higher price, yet of a ſuperior quality, to thoſe which are ſold at a lower rate.</p>
               <p>It is, beſides, very well known, that the Quakers in general ſell nearly at a fixed price. Now, ſuch a cuſtom admits of no cheating, which can only be prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by thoſe who vary their charges, and who, by taking advantage of the ignorance and credulity of the purchaſer, aſk much more than the market price. Theſe are the men who are to be miſtruſted, and not the Quakers, who ſell at a fixed rate.</p>
               <p>There is then very little probability in your ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous aſſertion, <hi>that it is a received maxim in trade, that they are not to be truſted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I maintain that it is a falſe aſſertion. I have heard quite a different account of them at London— a city, wherein, if they were much inclined to cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and corruption, they would much ſooner become cheats, and be corrupted, than at Philadelphia. Now, this is far from being the caſe, and it may be looked on as one of the greateſt prodigies of the age, that they have preſerved their virtue in ſuch a ſink of vice.</p>
               <p>I dare ſay, you may have heard ſuch an account in America. But would it not have been right for you to have traced out the foundation of this tale? Should you not have ſought for its origin in the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020981_0023_0FB1698332C6EE90"/>
wickedneſs and envy <note n="*" place="bottom">They have been reproached, ſays Mr. St. John de Crevecoeur. vol. 1, page 169, with their fondneſs for trade; but ſuch charges originate from envy, excited by their riches. The Quakers are for this reaſon the object of public envy in America, and conſequently we need not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at the many reports concerning them. Have we not ſeen, in the laſt centuries, the poor, proud and envious Chriſtians accuſing the Jews of the moſt horrid crimes, merely becauſe they became rich by trade?</note> of others? Should not you yourſelf have been ſure of the truth of it? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of only ſaying that the maxim is well founded, ſhould you not have ſhown that it was ſo, by well-atteſted facts? Once more, ſir; when a citizen is accuſed of a crime, the proofs and facts muſt be brought forward at the same time. Otherwise, an accuſation is but calumny, and as ſuch will your's be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, unleſs you particulariſe thoſe heavy charges you accuſe the Quakers with, and the whole ſociety at once, for you have ſlandered them all indiſcriminately.</p>

                  <hi>RELIGIOUS TENETS</hi> of the <hi>QUAKERS.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I ſhall now go on to treat of the ridicule you throw on the Quakers, when ſpeaking of their mode of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and religious tenets; and here too, I ſhall follow you, ſtep by ſtep.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>On Sunday the</hi> 10th, ſay you, <hi>I determined to take a turn thro' the churches, and ſtudy the different modes of worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that your's was a laughable way of <hi>ſtudying;</hi> to go and hear a ſingle prayer or ſermon, and catch at hazard few expreſſions, in a language and religion you were a ſtranger to. Since all ſects have their peculiar idioms, and make uſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon words in a different way from other people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the wit, who is for making ſo ſuperficial a courſe of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, runs a riſk of underſtanding nothing, and of forming erroneous ſentiments of every thing he hears.</p>
               <p>But, what could you mean by taking this <hi>ſtrange turn through the churches?</hi> Was it to become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their ceremonies? The Preſbyterians have but few—and the Quakers none at all. Was it to become acquainted with the principles and ſpirit of each ſect? This would have been a more reaſonable
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:020981_0024_0FB169868ABA8948"/>
and important object: But let a man be ever ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating, how can he flatter himſelf with fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, in a ſingle hour, at a ſingle opportunity, the principles and practice of any ſect? The firſt is to be learnt from books, the ſecond by frequent and long continued intercourſe.</p>
               <p>We are but too much addicted to this mania of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of objects from ſuperficial views, without going to the bottom of any thing. This is the caſe with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to all the ſciences. A man will ſuppoſe himſelf very knowing in natural philoſophy, and quite a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of chymiſtry, when he has attended a few lectures. This error has been already much complained of; but it does and will keep its ground, becauſe it is favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the quackery of teachers, and the lazineſs and vanity of ſcholars.</p>
               <p>"Unfortunately, ſay you, the ſeveral ſects, <hi>who agree in nothing elſe,</hi> have fixed on <hi>the ſame hour</hi> to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble their congregations."</p>
               <p>How can you affirm, that the religious ſects in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and in the United States, do not agree in any one point; when, all, to bring but a ſingle inſtance, look upon the Goſpel as a divine book; when, all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Unitarians, regard Chriſt as the Son of God, and all admit the neceſſity of prayer, &amp;c. You know too much to be ignorant of theſe facts; but you have ſacrificed the truth, to the pitiful pleaſure of making an antitheſis. It is rather ſingular too, that for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of the curious, you would wiſh to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all the ſects to different hours, for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their worſhip. Alas, why did not you make your <hi>tour</hi> of worſhips, as the petits maitres of Paris do their <hi>tour</hi> of play-houſes? A ſong at the Italian— a ſcene at the French theatre—a dance at the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra —and a turn at Vauxhall—they have ſeen every thing, and know every thing, for they have ſhewn themſelves every where, and all in the ſpace of two hours.</p>
               <p>When you made uſe of this expreſſion, if you had but recollected, that the man, whoſe ſoul is raiſed to God from a feeling ſenſe of duty, has his attention
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:020981_0025_0FB169877B55BA50"/>
but little turned to ſtrangers, but is wholly fixed on one object; if you had remembered too, the perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious conſequences, which, I ſhall hereafter ſhow, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this way of degrading religious ſubjects, treating them in a light manner, and putting them on a level with play-houſes, you would not have formed a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo ſuperficially of the Quakers, and Preſbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, nor even of the members of the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>If you had recollected too, that there is no diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſex in the ſight of God, you would certainly have ſpared that ſorry jeſt upon the women, which no one expected to ſee from the pen of an admirer of the fair ſex, and an academician: <hi>"Like Arioſto, I ſhall relate prodigies,</hi> dirò maraviglia, <hi>juſt as I entered, a woman held her tongue."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How could this trifling and hacknied piece of wit eſcape you, eſpecially with all the air of importance with which you make the quotation? You who are ſo warm in the praiſe of our French ladies—have you, then, never been acquainted with any who knew how to be ſtill, or whoſe converſation was agreeable? Have you never lived with Engliſh and American ladies? Have you not obſerved that they are modeſt and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, never in haſte to ſpeak, although well-inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Yes, well-informed, and well qualified to teach even men of learning and academicians. I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but one—Mrs. Macaulay: Her hiſtory of the Stuarts is certainly more uſeful than all the French academy has ever produced.</p>
               <p>And beſides, why would you leſſen the women? By undervaluing any one, you make him become deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable. The Quakers have done that juſtice to their women which we refuſed them. They have ſhewn they were not unworthy of it; for <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> has had its <hi>Porcias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſeem determined to find fault with every thing the Quakers do, whether they ſpeak or are ſilent. For you go on to ſay, "A man took the woman's place, and ſpoke <hi>like a block-head on internal grace, the illumination of the ſpirit,</hi> and all the other tenets
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:020981_0026_0FB169890A66DF50"/>
of his ſect, which <hi>he had over and over again,</hi> but without explaining any thing.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here, ſir, make bold to aſk you if you were ſufficiently acquainted with the language of the ſect, to underſtand this Quaker, and to form a judgment of his diſcourſe? A foreigner may underſtand the eloquent Burke in the houſe of commons, or Miſs Young at the theatre, without being always able to comprehend the preacher of any ſociety. The Quakers, of all others, have a language of their own, which cannot be eaſily underſtood, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having read ſome of their books, ſuch as Barc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay's Apology, with a great deal of attention. Now, I ſhould ſuſpect, from a word you have made uſe of, that you were not perfectly acquainted with the idiom and doctrine of the Quakers. It is when you find fault with the preacher for not <hi>explaining their religious tenets.</hi> Moſt probably he was clear enough for his brethren who underſtood his language, while to you who did not comprehend it, he was obſcrue. Now on the ſame principles, what would you think of a man, who, having learned the Indoſtan language, only in the grammar of Halhed, ſhould tell us of a Bramin's ſpeaking very ſtupidly about Viſtnou? What would you think of a wit, who, from his ignorance of the new doctrine of magnetiſm, ſhould call your <hi>reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on motion</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">A pamphlet of the Marquis de Chatellux's, publiſhed at the end of Monſ. Bergaſſe's reflections on magnetiſm.

And what would you ſay, if an Engliſhman, ignorant of the many hundred revolutions which have happened in the Nomenclator of French chymiſtry, ſhould call the <hi>Oxigine</hi> of Meſſrs. Fourcroy and Lavoiſier, a ſtupid and obſcure term?</p>
               <p>It is no difficult matter to accuſe a ſect, or ridicule their tenets. I have ſeen ſome of thoſe jeſters, who could not even tell you the meaning of the technical terms which they had picked up—I have heard many of them quote the doctrines of Janſenius with a ſneer,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:020981_0027_0FB1698AA3E94490"/>
who would have been greatly puzzled if any one had aſked them to explain the very firſt article.</p>
               <p>The ignorant are led away by words, and I make no doubt, that moſt perſons who read your book, and know nothing of the Quakers, will form their judgment of them, from the caricatura you have drawn; from theſe ſingle words <hi>"inward grace, illumination which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the ſpirit,"</hi> and more eſpecially from the beautiful turn about <hi>ſaying over and over again.</hi> They will exclaim—Where are theſe creatures from?— They are ſurely born in the laſt age—or inhabitants of ſome other world—poor ignorant mortals!</p>
               <p>I know nothing of the diſcourſe made by the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker you heard preach, but I will confeſs that the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets he ſhould have ſupported, the tenets of his ſect, do not appear to me to be ſo <hi>ſtupid</hi> as they did to you. I ſhall now give a ſhort account of them, not for your information, for you muſt certainly have read Benezet before you ridiculed him, but for thoſe who have no other knowledge of the Quakers but what they get <hi>from the ſtage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Quakers believe in one almighty, eternal and unchangeable God.</p>
               <p>They believe in the divinity and miſſion of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>They believe that all men <hi>may</hi> be ſaved.</p>
               <p>They <hi>admit</hi> of grace and univerſal light. That is to ſay, that God, of his grace, makes himſelf known, and diſcloſes the truth, to all thoſe who ſincerely deſire to know it, and ſeek after it.</p>
               <p>They believe that this grace was given to Socrates, Epictetus and Seneca, and to all thoſe ancient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, who joined the practice of virtue to their ſearch after truth. By the inward light, which they follow as their guide, they mean the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>Whoever, ſays Benezet<note n="*" place="bottom">See a ſhort account of the People called Quakers; their riſe, religious principles, and ſettlement in America, by Anthony Benezet.</note>, retires ſeriouſly into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with a ſincere deſire to know, and to do his duty, will never fail to find there a ſure guide, a ray from the fountain of light, which will enlighten his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:020981_0028_0FB1698D43E74098"/>
and teach him, with certainty, to diſtinguiſh good from evil. Thoſe who are obedient to this light, this divine guide, whatever religion they profeſs, ſoon ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the enjoyment of purity, holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Bible is the principal book which they read, or have recourſe to, for council and direction. They cannot, however, ſays Benezet, regard it as the word of God, becauſe this title belongs to Chriſt alone; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its contents admit of different interpretations, and becauſe men are apt to think that nothing further is neceſſary to their ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Concerning worſhip, they have neither ceremonies nor ſacraments, becauſe they ſay theſe terms are not found in the holy ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>They do not believe in elementary baptiſm, nor the uſe of bread and wine, as a ſacrament, to be eſſential; they look upon them as types and images; and think a good life is the certain way to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>They believe in the neceſſity of prayer, but that it ſhould always proceed from inſpiration.</p>
               <p>They keep meetings, becauſe God has promiſed, that where two or three perſons are gathered in his name, there he is in the midſt of them.</p>
               <p>They undertake not to ordain either prieſts, biſhops or miniſters, according to the hierarchy maintained in other Chriſtian churches.</p>
               <p>They think any man preſumptuous who would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the excluſive privilege of communion with God. Every believer may become a prieſt and miniſter. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Quaker is a preacher, when he feels himſelf autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed thereto by divine inſpiration. They therefore refuſe paying tythes. It is, according to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, degrading religion, to make it a matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; it is diſobeying the Supreme Being, who has ſaid, <hi>freely ye have received, freely give.</hi>

               <p>For the ſame reaſon, they reject the ſcience, called theology, as commonly taught in the ſchools, believing that it ſerves only to produce pride and diſputation.</p>
               <p>I ſhall in another place ſpeak of their ſentiments concerning war.</p>
               <p>It is well known that they never ſwear, according

               <p>The internal police of this ſect is very ſtrict and rational. They have their monthly meetings, which are made up of the members of ſuch meetings as lie contiguous; their quarterly meetings, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the ſeveral monthly meetings, which are neareſt to each other; and in like manner, their year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meetings, compoſed of the ſeveral adjacent quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly meetings. If a brother behaves amiſs, the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders caution him repeatedly, and get others to do the ſame. If he is irreclaimable, they lay his caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the monthly meeting, where it is judged. He may, if diſſatisfied with their deciſion, appeal from this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the quarterly meeting, where he has another hearing, and from thence, if ſtill diſcontented, to the yearly meeting, where it is finally adjudged. They are careful to avoid law ſuits; if any Quaker is poor, or unfortunate, the ſociety aſſiſts him.<note n="*" place="bottom">I was told, at London, of a Quaker Merchant, who whs thrice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by his friends; but failing a fourth time, he was perſuaded to decline trade, and had a penſion ſettled on him.</note>
               </p>
               <p>They look on it as a duty to contribute to general charities.</p>
               <p>They hold no places of office in the magiſtracy; but in Pennſylvania they were for ſome time in thoſe offices. Perceiving, however, that it was hardly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to adhere to their principles, amongſt the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that occurred there, they at length reſolved to give them up entirely.</p>
               <p>Such are the civil and religious tenets of the Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and to their praiſe be it ſpoken, they could never be compelled to abandon them, even in thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where they were without power, and perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and they obliged no one to embrace them, where they had the power in their own hands. To prove this, I ſhall quote two ſtriking paſſages, from Barclay and Penn, in their own words:—</p>
               <p>"But of this excellent patience and ſufferings, the witneſſes of God, in ſcorn called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:020981_0030_0FB169909B18B0F8"/>
a manifeſt proof: for ſo ſoon as God revealed his <hi>truth</hi> among them, without regard to any oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition whatſoever, or what they might meet with, they went up and down, as they were moved of the Lord, preaching and propagating the <hi>truth</hi> in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-places, highways, ſtreets, and publick temples, though daily beaten, whipped, bruiſed, haled, and impriſoned therefore. And when there was any where a church or aſſembly gathered, they taught them to keep their meetings openly, and not to ſhut the door, nor do it by ſtealth, that all might know it, and thoſe who would might enter. And as hereby all juſt occaſion of fear of plotting againſt the government was fully removed, ſo this their courage and faithfulneſs in not giving over their meeting together (but more eſpecially the preſence and glory of God manifeſted in the meeting being terrible to the conſciences of the perſecutors) did ſo weary out the malice of their adverſaries, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they were forced to leave their work undone. For when they came to break up a meeting, they <note n="*" place="bottom">During the reign of the infamous Charles IId who made a mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of every religious ſect, and to procure money, perſecuted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected them all by turns; a moſt bloody perſecution was excited againſt the Quakers. The King's guards, ſays Mrs. Macaulay, were ſet upon them; they were abuſed, wounded, and ſome were killed. Hays and Jenilt were arreſted for offering money to the conſtables, who were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying their friends to priſon. They were each of them condemned to pay a fine of £5000 Sterling, or ſuffer impriſonment. Penn and Mead, two reſpectable Quakers, were tried and fined forty marks, for having kept their hats on, &amp;c. Hiſtory of the Stuares, Vol. 6, Page 309, of the Quarto Edition.</note> were obliged to take every individual out by force, they not being free to give up their liberty by diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at their command: and when they were haled out, unleſs they were kept forth by violence, they preſently returned peaceably to their place. Yea, when ſometimes the magiſtrates have pulled down their meeting-houſes, they have met the next day openly upon the rubbiſh; and ſo by innocency kept their poſſeſſion and ground, being properly their own, and their right to meet and worſhip God, being not forfeited to any. So that when armed men have come
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:020981_0031_0FB169920B792240"/>
to diſſolve them, it was impoſſible for them to do it, unleſs they had killed every one; for they ſtood ſo cloſe together, that no force could move any one to ſtir, until violently pulled thence: ſo that when the malice of their oppoſers ſtirred them to take ſhovels, and throw the rubbiſh upon them, there they ſtood unmoved, being willing, if the Lord ſhould ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, to have been there buried alive, witneſſing for him. As this patient but yet courageous way of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made the perſecutors work very heavy and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſome unto them, ſo the courage and patience of the ſufferers, uſing no reſiſtance, nor bringing any wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to defend themſelves, nor ſeeking any ways of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon ſuch occaſions, did ſecretly ſmite the hearts of the perſecutors, and made their chariot-wheels go on heavily.

               <p>Barclay relates their ſufferings alſo in his ſpirited dedication to Charles IId, in which he affirms, that no Quaker was ever diſcovered to have been concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the many plots laid againſt him; and finiſhes this ſingular dedication with the following bold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>

               <p>Theſe paſſages, Sir, are a ſufficient proof of the ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs and conſtancy of the Quakers, in the midſt of perſecutions; and the ſpirited language of Barclay to Charles the IId, has always been maintained by them. The following paſſage will alſo ſhow their toleration, in a country where they had the power in their own hands.</p>
               <p>The immortal Penn, in the charter of privileges, which he granted to the inhabitants of Pennſylvania, on the 28th October 1701, inſerted the following clauſe.</p>
               <p>"Becauſe no people can be truly happy, tho' un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the greateſt enjoyment of civil liberties, if abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the freedom of their conſciences, as to their religious profeſſion and worſhip: And almighty God being the only Lord of conſcience, father of lights and ſpirits; and the author, as well as the object of all divine knowledge, faith and worſhip, who only doth enlighten the minds, and perſuade and convince the underſtandings of people, I do bereby grant and declare, that no perſon or perſons, inhabiting in this province or territories, who ſhall confeſs and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge one almighty God, the creator, upholder and ruler of the world; and profeſs him or themſelves obliged to live quietly under the civil government, ſhall be in any caſe moleſted or prejudiced, in his, or their perſon or eſtate, becauſe of his or their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious perſuaſion or practice, nor be compelled to frequent or maintain any religious worſhip, place or miniſtry, contrary to his or their mind, or to do or ſuffer any other act or thing, contrary to their religious perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

               <p>And now, ſir, forget that you have written againſt the Quakers, lay aſide your prejudices and witticiſms, retire within, and after reading the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I have juſt given, aſk yourſelf whether the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets and worſhip of the Quakers are ſo very ſtupid as you would ſuppoſe them.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, what is the meaning of that myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious farrago about inward grace, illumination and the ſpirit? I underſtand you, and might anſwer your queſtion by referring to the belief and tenets of the Catholics and Proteſtants, whom your cenſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves equally with the Quakers; but a philoſopher, an academician, muſt be anſwered in a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and I ſhall now attempt it.</p>
               <p>The words illumination, inward grace, extacy, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, expreſs the ſame ſpiritual ſtate of man, that ſtate in which he is plunged, when abſorbed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely taken up in a profound meditation on his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God and man. Were you never in this ſituation? If not, I pity you; for it is certainly the higheſt ſource of happineſs, I had almoſt ſaid, of enjoyment on earth. I will not attempt to deſcribe the effects of it—they are beyond deſcription. Thoſe delightful reveries in which the ſoul wanders, when eſcaped from the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed coverings which confine her; that ſublime and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatory glimpſe of things beyond herſelf, beyond the globe and in a better world, is fled and gone, when we attempt to deſcribe it.</p>
               <p>This ſtate is to be arrived at, ſolely, by a perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward retirement, and a ſolitary <note n="*" place="bottom">By a remarkable peculiarity, it happens that enthuſiaſts and illuminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſons are ofteneſt found in deſpotic governments The reaſon is plain, for men are there forced to live a ſolitary life; and when we are unhappy at home, we ſeek for a retreat elſewhere; when the earth is but a place of torment, the wretched look to heaven for relief, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come enthuſiaſts, becauſe it is unſafe to be citizens. There are addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional reaſons for reſpecting enthuſiaſm.</note> and innocent life; and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:020981_0034_0FB16996831A4FC0"/>
can only be reliſhed by thoſe pure ſouls who are lifted above the vain pleaſures and trifling objects of worldly ambition.</p>
               <p>This ſtate is the direct road to the knowledge of God, of real happineſs, and of the proper objects of man's purſuit. It leads us naturally to the true means of obtaining it. Theſe means are the public and ſocial virtues. From whence it follows, that the man who is continually employed in ſelf-meditation, becomes of courſe, good, tolerant, juſt and beneficent—for he endeavours to approach the Divinity, and to reſemble him; and it is virtue alone that can fill up the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſpace which ſeparates them.</p>
               <p>Illumination, inward grace, the holy ſpirit of the Quakers, is nothing elſe but this ſtate of knowledge, which is to be attained by meditation. They never pray without meditating—they never preach without being inſpired, which is always the fruit of meditation.</p>
               <p>I have then proved to you, that the man who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually employed in meditation on himſelf, on the Divinity, and on his own duty, will naturally become a virtuous man; and, of courſe, the illumination of the Quakers directs them naturally to virtue; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is ſupported by facts; of conſequence their ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem is a reſpectable one, and making a jeſt of it, ſhews an ignorance of it's principles and effects—It is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt virtue.</p>
               <p>It ſeems to me that theſe concluſions cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, however, I challenge you to do it.</p>
               <p>I well know that our wits, even ſome of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated ones, have been very ingenious in their ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſms on this ſtate of illumination. But what do ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſms prove? What abſurdity may not a wit be guilty of? What virtue is ſafe from their ridicule? Let us leave irony apart, and come to facts and reaſoning— Turn over Voltaire from beginning to end, the man who has, above all others, brought into repute this rage of ſubſtituting ridicule for reaſoning, and who has carried it even to the ſcaffold. In all his writings,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:020981_0035_0FB169982185B210"/>
you will not find one ſolid argument againſt illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:<note n="*" place="bottom">To do juſtice to Voltaire, it muſt be acknowledged, that he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpeaks well of the Quakers, though in a ludicrous manner. See the words Quakers, and Egliſe primitive in the queſtions ſur l' Encyclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedie.</note> His only weapons are puns and epigrams.</p>
               <p>It is with regret I mention it, but theſe too, are the weapons moſt frequently made uſe of by the Count de Mirabeau, in the book which he has juſt publiſhed againſt the celebrated Lavater <note n="†" place="bottom">Comte de Mirebeau's Letter, on Meſſrs. Caglioſtro &amp; Lavater, Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin. 1786.</note> and his followers, whom he calls the enlightened, and againſt illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in general.</p>
               <p>But there is a diſtinction to be made which has eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped this writer, and thoſe who have wrote on the ſame ſubject before him, <note n="‡" place="bottom">The famous Lord Shaftſbury has publiſhed a letter againſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm. I have not read the Letter; but by ſketches of it which I have ſeen, it appears that his principal deſign was to prevent the miſchief threatened by ſome falſe prophets, who wiſhed to ſpread deſolation thro' the country, by ſubjecting the minds of the people. His letter ſhould have been entitled, <hi>on falſe</hi> enthuſiaſm.</note> and which is daily eſcaping the vulgar who are ſo ready to condemn every thing above their reach—He has confounded the pretended, with the real enlightened man.</p>
               <p>I agree that the pretended are the moſt numerous; for whenever there appears in the world characters ſtrongly marked, who announce important truths and fix the attention of mankind, they are ſoon ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and followed by a crowd of intriguing perſons, who take advantage of their diſcoveries, and who, aping their appearance, hope to dupe the credulous public, and too often are ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>The real philoſopher ought to make the moſt vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effors to detect theſe infamous cheats; he ought to inveigh againſt hypocriſy and illumination, when made a trade of, but not againſt real illumination: For by ridiculing this laſt only, they are diſappointed in their aims, they traduce what is reſpectable, and treat with reſpect, or paſs over in ſilence, thoſe things which ſhould be condemned. They give encouragement to
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:020981_0036_0FB1699C222F2CC8"/>
the hypocrite, who is put on a footing with the virtuous man, and finds a ſhelter under his protection.</p>
               <p>But there is, in this caſe, an infallible method of diſtinguiſhing the falſe from the true. Whenever one of theſe enlightened perſons has ambitious, intereſted, or worldly views, you may be certain that he is only a pretender to illumination, and you ſhould never he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate to detect the <hi>cheat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Philoſophy too, has been the inſtrument of cheating in the hands of the ſophiſts. But as it would be abſurd to throw on real philoſophers that odium which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to the cheats who have uſurped this title to acquire riches or reputation, ſo it would be unjuſt to confound George Fox, Penn, Benezet and the reſt of the true Quakers, with the falſe, if there are any, who, as you tell us, make uſe of this covering to conceal their vices and intereſted views. It would be unjuſt to confound the honeſt Lavater with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers who make a trade of illumination and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies.</p>
               <p>What I now ſay, is equally applicable to the enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened Catholics—I have no doubt but Fenelon was of this number—That ſweet anointing virtue which runs through his letters, could only be produced by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued extaſies—And who is there ſo devoid of reaſon and feeling as to ſay that Fenelon was a cheat or a fool?</p>
               <p>Such a man would at once condemn almoſt every true philoſopher, and eſpecially Rouſſeau. Read this author's dialogues with himſelf; they ſeem to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in another world: And a man who exiſts in this world only, and has never been beyond it, could not have written two words of them.</p>
               <p>Were I to run over the catalogue of ancient and modern philoſophers, there is ſcarce one of them who has not been enlightened, and conſequently been looked upon as a fool by his cotemporaries; this was Plato's caſe; and did not Deſcartes appear as a mad-man, when, in the public church, and preſence of the divinity, he conſecrated himſelf by an oath to the defence of truth. And his pupil, the famous Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebranche, do not all his works bear the wonderful
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:020981_0037_0FB1699D4DAE22E0"/>
ſtamp of illumination? He was the child, the man of meditation.</p>
               <p>The example of theſe great men will be another proof, ſir, of what I have already demonſtrated, that this ſtate, far from being dangerous to ſociety, is on the contrary, favourable to virtue. For where ſhall we find a more diſintereſted character than Malle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branche, where a more ſublime one than Rouſſeau, where one more beneficent, or more reſembling the divinity, than Fenelon?</p>
               <p>And let it be obſerved too, that this diſintereſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, this ſublimity, this beneficence, were the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fruits of that habit of ſpiritual contemplation, in which man becomes <hi>ex-organiſed, and ex-humaniſed,</hi> if I may uſe the expreſſions.</p>
               <p>In forming a judgment of extraordinary men, I believe we do not pay a ſufficient attention to their private characters; I do not mean, that this ſhould always influence us with regard to their opinions; but it ſhould at leaſt teach us to be careful in paſſing our judgment, and above all things, not to blacken their characters: Their virtue ſhould apologize for their miſtakes, but genius can never be an excuſe for vice.</p>
               <p>I am further of opinion, that we are too apt to condemn whatever is foreign to us, and to our way of thinking. The courage of thoſe who dare to ſtrike out new paths, is not held in the eſtimation it deſerves. The good conſequences of enthuſiaſm, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by new ideas, is not ſufficiently felt.</p>
               <p>Every kind of enthuſiaſm is attended with a move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a diſplacing of the human mind, a flight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ordinary bounds. This is the natural conſequence of the elements of our ſpiritual princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, of it's reſtleſs activity, of it's curioſity to know what is true, and to enjoy the beſt. This active diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, often leads the ſoul aſtray into errors and chimeras; but on the other hand, it often leads to the diſcovery of uſeful truths. To ſtop the courſe of enthuſiaſm then, by ridicule, is to limit the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of truths, and to circumſcribe human perfection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:020981_0038_0FB1699ECC782380"/>But further, the cauſe of tyranny is ſerved by this kind of ridicule; for ſince there are amongſt theſe truths which have been, or may be diſcovered, ſome that might prove fatal to it; it is the intereſt of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants to oppoſe that enthuſiaſm which cauſes them to be diſcovered, ſpread and adopted. Tyrants, by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing this ſyſtem, would make man a mere machine. A Nero, were he now alive, would look with terror upon the preſent ſtate of mens' minds. He would regard them with horror, agitated by a ſecret fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, continually ſeeking to change their ſituation, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the weight they feel, and endeavouring to free themſelves from it. He would ſee, with horror, ſome launching into the regions of metaphyſics, and there boldly hovering between heaven and earth; others penetrated with a ſenſe of the dignity of <hi>man,</hi> are ſhocked at the attempts of individuals, to degrade it, all moving with the ſame enthuſiaſm, boldly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their doctrines, and giving riſe to diſcuſſions which tend to the public improvement.</p>
               <p>As tyranny is continually obſtructing the progreſs of knowledge, the ſimple and obſcure individual who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts it, muſt have a ſupport, and none ſo certain as enthuſiaſm—Armed with the inward conviction that he is the defender of truth, raiſed above all fear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is continually raiſed above all earthly things; the enthuſiaſt gives a ſhock to the mind, while he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf remains immoveable.<note n="*" place="bottom">Do you think, ſir, that truth would long maintain it's ground againſt tyranny, in a perſon of an indifferent turn of mind? If Phalaris had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Geometrician to ſay that two and two made five, he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have been obeyed. But inſtead of Geometry, let us ſuppoſe the matter in queſtion, to have been of a nature, more cloſely connected with the dignity of man, and more ſuſceptible of enthuſiaſm, the tyrant would then have found his miſtake.</note>
               </p>
               <p>His exiſtence is a real benefit to the community that poſſeſſes him; he in time makes them partakers of his exalted ſtate. And indeed, enthuſiaſm, tranſporting the minds of men into a more exalted ſphere, habituates them to a certain elevation, which they preſerve when they deſcend into the common circle of things. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſt,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:020981_0039_0FB169A043897CB0"/>
the enlightened man, have not the ſame language nor the ſame phyſiognomy as common men. Theirs is an heavenly language, a noble countenance, which moſt forcibly electrines thoſe who look upon it. Obſerve the man who has frequent communion with himſelf and with his God—Serenity reigns on his viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and happineſs in his life; there is a ſomething commanding in his looks, which ſeems to make you feel your inferiority—In his preſence vanity ſhrinks, vice bluſhes, and feeble virtue grows ſtrong. Thus, the real and virtuous enthuſiaſt, governs a whole commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by his preſence, and by a firm and ſteady <hi>reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You, ſir, who have ſtudied the ſecrets of magnetiſm, and who have boldly ranked yourſelf amongſt it's defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in ſpite of the academic confederacy, you muſt be well acquainted with the ſingular effects of this <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,</hi> this beneficent enthuſiaſm, in which the whole ſyſtem of magnetiſm conſiſts. Be no longer, then, the enemy of enthuſiaſts and enlightened perſons; make a jeſt of them no longer. I have but one word more to ſay on this head: If the progreſs of George Fox and William Penn had been checked by ridicule, what a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune would it have been for mankind! The Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Indians would ſtill be maſſacred; the Negroes would ſtill be ſlaves; the principles of equality and their conſequence, democracy, would not have been ſo well known, and the American revolution would not have been effected: And all this is owing to the ſpirit of illumination and enthuſiaſm.</p>
               <p>No longer vilify the worſhip of the Quakers, becauſe you think it gloomy and clowniſh. It is ſimple, and of conſequence more reſpectful to the Deity. It turns the minds of men from idolatry, and by confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to a ſtate of meditation, fixes their ſerious attention on the ſupreme being, which is of much greater importance than ſinging his praiſes by rote.</p>
               <p>No longer ſpeak ſo highly of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's mode of worſhip, for the reſemblance you ſaw in it to an opera; for the fine pulpit, beautiful organ, handſome miniſter, and elegant women; or for the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:020981_0040_0FB169A1EA037288"/>
agreeable ſonatas you heard ſung there. Good hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens! compare a church to a playhouſe; and the eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations of the devout man to the Divinity, to Italian ſongs! How could you deſcend to ſuch puerile and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent compariſons? It is excuſable in a child to be captivated by fine play-things, but how mean an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt we entertain of the judgment and metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſics of a man grown, an academician too, who calls himſelf a philoſopher, to ſee him looking after and admiring nothing elſe in divine worſhip, but the dreſs of the ladies and the elegant theatrical grace of a ſurpluſed Petit-maitre. For what muſt be your idea of the Divinity, if you ſuppoſe that the prayers and homage of a handſome miniſter and well-dreſſed wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are more acceptable to him, than thoſe of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous men, with plain clothes; or that charming ſongs are more acceptable than good works? At any rate, this ſenſual taſte, can only belong to the indolent and voluptuous deities of Epicurus, but the God of the philoſopher is the ſource of all truth and virtue. Does he not receive a more acceptable homage from thoſe who ſeek truth by meditation, and practiſe virtue, than from ſinging and dancing. And is it not uttering blaſphemy againſt him, if it were poſſible to do ſo, thus to ſuppoſe he can be worſhipped by ſtage-players and buffoons?</p>
               <p>I by no means charge you with making ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, but would-be-wits, and weak minds, will draw them from your jeſts—How diverted they will be with your curious quotation from the Deſerter, and that compariſon between the ignorant ſectary and Montauciel, who finds in his book, words that were never there. But this is the true academic turn of mind.—Unhappy diſpoſition, which gives us puns and jeſts for reaſons, which leſſens every thing that is great <note n="*" place="bottom">This diſpoſition is to be met with, in many parts of your travels. Another paſſage of the ſame kind is quoted, when you are ſpeaking of the Negroes. I have juſt laid my hands on a third; it is where you are deſcribing the famous natural Bridge, in which you ſee nothing <hi>but nature endeavouring to imitate art.</hi> This is giving much the ſame idea of nature, as the Poet, who in deſcribing the ſublime Meteors of the Alps, tells us that the clouds roſe like the curtain at the Theatre. And this to be ſure is wit! We cannot leſſen or degrade Nature more than by comparing her operations to the feeble works of men. We cannot more certainly deſtroy the intereſting effect, produced in feeling minds, by the ſight of a fine landſcape, a magnificent ſky, or a frightful cataract, than by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them to the productions of art.</note> by the mere touch, which ſhrivels up the ſoul,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:020981_0041_0FB169A34CE2C848"/>
ſhortens the ſight, and disfigures every object! I muſt again lament that the author of la Felicité publique, ſhould be corrupted by this epidemic <hi>rage</hi> for wit.</p>
               <p>And you ſuppoſe, then, that you have proved to a demonſtration, that all religious ſects are in an error, by comparing them to Montauciel, who could not ſpell, and by ſaying, that it was a million to one, that he gueſſed right.</p>
               <p>Which is as much as to ſay, that <hi>becauſe</hi> Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciel, who did not know his letters, could not read, ſo we have no method of becoming verſed in the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; <hi>and conſequently,</hi> that we are not poſſeſſed of reaſon, inward feeling or conſcience, thoſe three guides of knowledge and conduct. That, in religious matters, it is a million to one, that the truth is yet concealed, that the true religion is yet unknown, and like to be ſo, for there is a million of chances againſt it. Now is ſuch a ſyſtem as this defenſible? Do you ſuppoſe that there is no ſuch thing as a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious truth? ſuch a ſuppoſition would make the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of mankind unhappy, and place oppreſſors wholly at their eaſe.</p>
               <p>Is there any more appearance of reaſon, in your traducing the Quakers, by charging them with bloody diſputes, and by ſaying that it is better to leave them in their error than to go to cutting throats with them? How is this? do the Quakers endeavour to convince or gain over any one? And do they, when reſiſted, wield the ſword, or light the faggot? You do not believe it; or if you did, hiſtory would undeceive you, and yet, when caſting your jokes on all the ſects, you charge them as well as the others, with this enormity.</p>
               <p>There appears throughout this paragraph, an air of ridiculing every religious ſect, as well as of the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:020981_0042_0FB169A4C1D8BB88"/>
worſhip of the Deity, which weak minds will extend to the Deity himſelf. Oh ſir, blame not a ſociety for any thing but for their intolerance, and for profeſſing principles which produce hatred: But let us commend them for reſembling one another in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in God, and in the neceſſity of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>Philoſophers, by being too warm in their oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to certain religious prejudices, have not yet ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently conſidered the extenſive influence which a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in God and a future ſtate, would have on political conſtitutions: He who believes in God, can fear nobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: He who believes in God, will ſpeak the truth bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he will deſpiſe torments and death itſelf: He who believes in God, will love and cheriſh all mankind, he will, if poſſible, revenge them when oppreſt: He who believes in God, may become a Cato, a Sidney, a Benezet, the greateſt and moſt reſpectable of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beings, but he can never become a Caeſar or a Sejancus.</p>
               <p>How ſtrong is man when ſupported, on one hand by the truth, and on the other by the Deity! He is then irreſiſtible—Power vaniſhes before him, and the ſword menaces in vain <note n="†" place="bottom">The Hiſtory of England abounds with facts, in ſupport of this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <head>On the <hi>POLITICAL PRINCIPLES</hi> of the <hi>QUAKERS.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Have you been more ſucceſsful or juſt, ſir, in your attack upon the political or civil principles of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers? I think not. One of them claims the favour and encouragement of all ſovereigns. They are eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where reſpectful and obedient to government, and never revolt, or have recourſe to arms, whatever im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions they ſuffer. You do not reproach them for this principle of forbearance, which, perhaps ſingly, prevents crowds of virtuous, but brave men, from embracing their ſyſtem; but you are offended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in conſequence of it, they proſcribe war, and that military art you ſo ardently admire.</p>
               <p>"Concealing, ſay you, their indifference for <hi>the public good,</hi> under the appearance of religion, they are ſparing of blood, <hi>eſpecially their own,</hi> &amp;c."</p>
               <p>Thus, ſir, you miſapply words, which ill under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, beget abſurd and bloody conteſts. If the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes of princes, or the reſpective national pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, often ſupported with the unneceſſary effuſion of blood, conſtitute what you denominate public good; it muſt be confeſſed that the Quakers are indifferent to ſuch follies, and refuſe to contribute to them. But in reſpect to the general benefit of ſociety, that is to ſay, the relief of diſtreſſed individuals, the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the indigent, zeal and liberality in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of uſeful inſtitutions, the Quakers, far from being indifferent, are among the firſt to comfort and aſſiſt the unfortunate. For proof, I oppoſe you to yourſelf, I quote you for all you allow them to have done for the public good at Philadelphia, where they have principally planned and ſupported many uſeful and neceſſary inſtitutions. For, notwithſtanding they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage public ſpectacles, you will allow that they may promote the welfare of their fellow-citizens, without entertaining them with an opera or a ſtage play. I quote that Benezet, whom you cannot but eſteem, that Mifflin, of whom M. St. John de Creve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coeur gives us ſuch an amiable character, that Fother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill, whoſe life was one continued ſcene of great and
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:020981_0044_0FB169A9E52D3A28"/>
good actions, in a word, I quote their general eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the Negroes. Where ſhall we meet with ſuch another ſublime inſtance of regard for the public good! Can you ſuppoſe that the reſtoration of milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of wretched beings to life, to virtue, and to ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; and the abolition of the moſt deteſtable trade that ever was undertaken, a trade in human blood! Can you ſuppoſe, I ſay, that theſe are objects of leſs importance to the public welfare than the maſſacre of thouſands of Engliſhmen out of patriotiſm?</p>
               <p>Confeſs, ſir, that this kind of public ſpirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the preference, and no doubt you will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced upon ſerious reflection, that the Quakers have ſhewn themſelves friends to the public good, by taking no part as a body in the civil commotions which have laid waſte and diſmembered the Britiſh empire in the laſt and preſent centuries. What! would you blame them becauſe they did not pray for the ſucceſs of that tyrant Charles II, uncorrected by the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of his father, whoſe wars only ſerved him for a pretence to rob his ſubjects of money to laviſh upon his miſtreſſes? For the ambitious William, who caſt the firſt link of that oppreſſive chain of national debt, whoſe weight becomes at preſent too heavy to be borne? For Ann ſucceſſively governed by ambitious or obſcure favorites, uninformed, intriguing, and a ſtranger to her ſubjects? For the abſurd diſpute about the Spaniſh ſucceſſion, or that of the empire no leſs abſurd and expenſive? In ſhort, would you blame them for not having joined with Clive to aſſaſſinate Nabobs, who had been the benefactors of his country, with Verelſt, to hurry three millions of Indians into eternity by the cruel death of famine, with Haſtings, to exterminate a hundred thouſand Rohillas; in ſhort, with all the ravages of India, to rob, fetter, maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre the moſt mild, virtuous and friendly people upon earth.</p>
               <p>If this maſs of national enormities, is what you call public good, it is not only a virtue not to ſtain our hands with it; it is a duty to avoid it—confeſs, ſir, that ſuch public good is merely that of a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, of the miniſtry, of the military, who for
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:020981_0045_0FB169AAC12190E8"/>
amuſement or promotion, charitably ſet people to cut each other's throats. But ſuch public good is a general evil, an evil for all nations, and eſpecially to the people, who are always oppreſſed, whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering or conquered. Let us then commend the Quakers for their indifference to ſuch nominal public good; let us commend them for weeping over its ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous conſequences, though they never contribute to them, and thus uniting religion and humanity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They are ſparing of blood</hi>—ſo much the better—Are there not enough who laviſh it? Are not a million of bayonets at our breaſts from one end of Europe to the other, ſufficient? Are there not murderers enough? Muſt it be counted a crime in the Quakers, not to be found in this liſt of deſtroyers of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race.</p>
               <p>Theſe enlightened men, fully convinced that the baſis of univerſal happineſs is univerſal peace, and that war muſt be utterly renounced to introduce it. Convinced that preaching would be ineffectual, if not ſeconded by example, and that princes would find the means of perpetuating war as long as men could be hired to cut each others throats, determined never to uſe arms or contribute to the ſupport of any war. They have been robbed, impriſoned, tortured, martyred; they endured it all, and at length, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by their conſtancy, tyranny has exempted them from military ſervices, and is obliged to uſe force in obtaining contributions from them. And indeed what ſhould the Quakers pay for? To hire ſoldiers? They would there were none. Prieſts? they do not want any; they are all prieſts. Magiſtrates? they need none, they have no law-ſuits.</p>
               <p>What would become of our heroe's, if every ſect had imbibed this anti-military ſpirit; if all anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized war; if no Automaton would ſuffer himſelf to be trained up for the infernal taſk of murdering his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? —What would become of the ambition of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, if all men, turned Quakers, ſhould firmly, and with one conſent, refuſe to ſecond their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with a muſket? O then! if we love the public

good, let us pray that this exalted ſect may increaſe and ſpread over the earth, or at leaſt, that its humane principles may be every where received, then would that peace become univerſal<note n="*" place="bottom">Men who are prejudiced or intereſted in the exiſtence of reigning evils, ſtigmatiſe thoſe who preach the doctrine of univerſal peace, and oppoſe war with the title of <hi>declaimers.</hi> Notwithſtanding, the world im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves under their ſermons, in the act of ridiculing them. Let the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſans for war, inform us, whether the paſſion for it is ſo general, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled in the preſent age, as it was, for inſtance, in the time of the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades. War is no longer a raging fever, it is a mere matter of ſpeculation. Now to have changed he rage to computation, is a great ſtep gained; and we have only to prove that war is a bad ſpeculation for <hi>all parties.</hi> To whom is this change of ideas owing, if not to the philoſophers who are called declaimers? The word declaimer, like that of <hi>viſionary</hi> is uſed to turn the man of genius into ridicule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who ſpeaks highly of the rights of men, and boldly oppoſes thoſe errors which the world agreed to laugh at, and continue.</note>, which the Quakers have already realiſed, in thoſe countries where they are moſt numerous. Let the ambitious who ſigh for ribbands and croſſes, deteſt this idea; let them ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule us, ſuſpect us of cowardice, and proclaim to the world, that we are ſparing of our own blood; it is better to be ridiculous, if this is ſo, than to become the murderers of our brethren.</p>
               <p>It is thus, ſir, you are pleaſed to banter the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers; you ſay they ſhun war, particularly <hi>to ſpare their own blood;</hi> as if the Quaker, who uſes no wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of defence, were not more expoſed to danger than he who carries them and defends himſelf; as if the angry ſavage would reſpect his ſcalp, or the European conqueror his exiſtence.</p>
               <p>No, the Quakers do not avoid fighting to ſpare their own blood, but to ſpare that of their fellowmen. Can you doubt it, you who have ſeen them during the late war boldly venturing to ſuccour their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, their countrymen, their enemies themſelves?</p>
               <p>If you ſtill doubt their courage, look back to the perſecutions they have ſuffered, read their martyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy; behold them tranquil and ſerene in dungeons, undaunted before their judges, mounting the gallows without terror; behold even their women, poſſeſſed of equal reſolution, braving torture and defying the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>I will relate one inſtance—Mary Dyar, one of thoſe perſons who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Boſton, after their unjuſt baniſhment upon pain of death, when the ſentence was paſſed upon her, undauntedly replied, "the will of the Lord be done;" whereupon, the judge ordered her to be taken away, and ſhe anſwered again, "yea, joyfully I go." At the foot of the ladder, where her two companions ſuffered martyrdom, ſhe cried out, "this is to me an hour of the greateſt joy; no-body can conceive the ſweet and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influences of the Lord's ſpirit, which I now feel." Ready to meet her diſſolution, ſhe was reſpited and taken back to priſon, from whence ſhe wrote a letter to the general court, charging them with the guilt of innocent blood, in which ſhe ſaid ſhe looked upon their mercy as cruelty. She was baniſhed a ſecond time, but returning to Boſton, was again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die—When the judge repeated her ſentence, ſhe ſaid, "this is no more than what thou ſaidſt before." I am come to warn you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal your unrighteous laws: If thou condemneſt me, the Lord will ſend others of his ſervants to witneſs againſt them A pardon was offered her if ſhe would go away and deſiſt from preaching; ſhe refuſed to do ſo, and ſuffered death.</p>
                     <p>See the before quoted article upon the Quakers, in my journal.</p>
                  </note>. Such courage, ſir, is very different from
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:020981_0047_0FB169ADC254FC20"/>
that of the ſoldier in the day of battle, chiefly inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the adventitious circumſtances which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round him, and poſſeſs every faculty of his ſoul. The confuſed diſcharge of muſketry, and the report of cannon, ſounds which baniſh all reflection, the neceſſity to kill or be killed, the chance of eſcape, the looks of his comrades and of his general, the hope of laurels, and croſſes, every thing ſupports, every thing animates, and impels him to what is called heroiſm; but all this is foreign to it.</p>
               <p>How different is the fortitude of the individual, who aſcends the ſcaffold a martyr to his religious or political opinions! every thing around is againſt him, or at leaſt indifferent; the image of certain death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and the apparatus of his execution. He has no eſcape, no honors, no ribbands to expect—death advances, and he meets him without terror.</p>
               <p>Behold the man of true courage! behold the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe! His courage is innate, it ſprings from his own breaſt; he dies alone, ſenſible of the approach of death. Such were Ruſſel, Sydney, Barnevelt, De Witt, &amp;c. and all thoſe Quakers who have ſuffered impriſonment and death in defence of their faith. Now will you venture to make a jeſt of their courage, their ſingularities, or the plainneſs of their language?</p>
               <p>If the witty, following your example, cannot be ſatisfied without diſparaging this reſpectable ſect by
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:020981_0048_0FB169AF39CF0E98"/>
their ſarcaſtic ſneers—I repeat what I have ſaid elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, I will forgive them their epigrams, if they can ſay on their death-beds, with a deſcendant of the celebrated Penn, "I never did a wicked thing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly." I will forgive them, if they can quit life and its enjoyments in the bloom of youth without regret, if they have the reſolution, like moſt Quakers, to comfort their weeping friends—I will forgive them, if they practiſed through life, the meekneſs, probity, and other good qualities of the Quakers. Though they may appear ridiculous in the eyes of a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and their language may ſeem emphatic, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igmatical, even though they ſhould hold immaterial er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, or inſiſt too ſtrenuouſly upon minutiae; what matter if they are virtuous? Let us ſhun their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, but imitate their good qualities, or if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not accompliſh both, let us ſacrifice our vanity to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and be very careful how we blame. Hitherto, the Quakers have been repreſented in a ridiculous point of view; both at Paris and London, they have been indecently exhibited upon the ſtage. An Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophanes, has been found to ſacrifice Socrates to the public. Let the public lay aſide their prejudices, let them ſtudy, let them ſcrutinize the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, they will find their doctrines plain, their morals pure, and the ſimplicity of their manners perfectly conſiſtent; they will find energy and ſublimity in their character, in the midſt of general ſeduction and the moſt ſhocking depravity. Even ſelfiſhneſs, that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal poiſon, is a vice unknown to the true Quaker. All Quakers are his friends, his brethren—He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices in their joy, he weeps for their misfortunes, he ſupports them in their diſtreſs; his friendſhip ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the whole human race, it is his family, and he delights in doing good to all its members. May ſuch principles ſpread and be imitated, and practiſed by all. But they will find no imitators until men ſhall boldly adopt the ſimplicity of the Quakers, for <hi>luxury cannot be humane.</hi> The income of a Croeſus will always be exceeded by his expences; the man who ſacrifices to pleaſure, rarely enjoys the luxury of doing good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:020981_0049_0FB169B0E7D799A8"/>Three great vices, or rather crimes, have introduced all the evils that afflict the earth; ſuch as deſpotiſm, war, and public or private injuſtice: They are am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, covetouſneſs, and luxury—Are not the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, who renounce power, free from Ambition? What object could inſpire covetouſneſs amongſt people who deſpiſe luxury<note n="*" place="bottom">Si luxuriae temperares, avaritiam non timeres, <hi>ſaid Tacitus.</hi>
                  </note>? This then is the ſect for thoſe States which would baniſh deſpotiſm, and all other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical crimes. It is the ſect for republics; <note n="†" place="bottom">Doctor Franklin, in his obſervations on population, publiſhed in 1751, juſtly obſerves, that thoſe ſects which unite regularity and oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with ſimplicity of manners, increaſe the moſt rapidly, becauſe they furniſh them with the means of providing for a numerous offspring. This is the reaſon why the Quakers are ſo numerous in Pennſylvania.</note> It is the ſect for monarchies; In a word, it is the ſect for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. Since if Quakeriſm were univerſal, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind would form but one loving and harmonious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>And yet this is the people you calumniate! but I am not ſurpriſed at it; the Quakers deteſt the military art, and you are a ſoldier. They undervalue what we call wit, and you have diſplayed your pretenſions to it; you are a member of the royal academy! They preach equality of men and ranks, and you are a man of quality <note n="‡" place="bottom">Will it be believed, that theſe obſervations upon the Quakers, as well as thoſe upon the Negroes, to be remarked directly, are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly noticed in the Journal de Paris, May 21. 1786, as two excellent paſſages. I muſt ſay, to the credit of its reſpectable compiler, Mr. Sautreau, that this article cannot have proceeded from his pen. He is too well acquainted with hiſtory, and is beſides a man of too much ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, to have written ſuch a panegyric.

               <p>"The Britiſh act of Parliament, which allows the ſimple affirmation of the Quakers in civil caſes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting them from the oath which is required of all other ſects, is the fulleſt eulogium upon their principles, their morals, and their conſtancy."</p>
               <p>"Upon an attentive examination of the conſtitutions of their churches, ſchools, hoſpitals and other charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtitutions, there appears a degree of philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy that ſhould diſarm envy and ridicule."</p>

               <p>"Beneficence, a general characteriſtic of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, ſhone with peculiar luſtre in the good John Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thergill, who ſpent his life in healing the ſick, in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting and comforting the miſerable. This was the firſt man who thought of teaching the wretched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the coaſt of Guinea to plant the ſugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane, inſtead of cultivating it for the whites in a ſtrange land.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The following Anecdotes will exhibit the character of this benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of mankind. He had a friend at London, who depended upon a ſmall curacy of fifty guineas a year, for the ſupport of a wife and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous family. The mother and five children were ſeized at once by an epidemic diſtemper. In this diſtreſſing ſituation, the Curate would not apply to Fothergill, becauſe he had nothing to fee him with.

They went together to the Doctor, who refuſed a fee, but viſited the diſtreſſed family, till he had effected a cure.</p>

They are taught morality, decency, regularity, ſubordination to their ſuperiors, forbearance towards each other, and eſpecially that habit of ſilence and meditation ſo much recommended in the ancient ſchools of philoſophy, and which are abſolutely neceſſary for the attainment of real ſcience.

                  <q>Below this claſs of inhabitants, (the whites of no property, in Virginia,) we muſt rank the Negroes, who would be ſtill more to be pitied, if their <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſenſibility did not in ſome meaſure alleviate the wretchedneſs inſeparable from ſlavery.</hi> Seeing them ill lodged, ill clothed, and often overcome with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, I concluded that their treatment had been as rigorous as it is elſewhere. Notwithſtanding I have been aſſured that it is very mild, compared to what they ſuffer in the Sugar Colonies. And indeed one does not hear <hi>habitually,</hi> as at Jamaica and St. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo, the ſound of whips, and the outcries of the wretched beings, whoſe bodies are torn piece meal by their ſtrokes. It is becauſe the people of Virginia are commonly milder than thoſe of the Sugar Colonies, which conſiſt chiefly of rapacious men, eager to amaſs fortunes, as ſoon as poſſible, and return to Europe. The produce of their labours being alſo leſs valuable, their taſks are not ſo rigorouſly exacted, and in juſtice to both, it muſt be allowed that the Negroes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are leſs treacherous and thieviſh, than they are in the Iſlands: for the propagation of the black ſpeices being very conſiderable here, moſt of them are born in the country, and it is remarked that theſe are in general <hi>leſs depraved</hi> than thoſe import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Africa. Beſides, we muſt do the Virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans the juſtice to remark, that many of them treat

                  <q>However this may be, it is fortunate that differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent motives concur to deter mankind from exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch tyranny, at leaſt upon their own ſpecies, if we cannot ſay, ſtrictly ſpeaking, <hi>their equals;</hi> for the more we obſerve the Negroes, the more we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the difference between us <hi>does not lie in the colour alone,</hi> &amp;c.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Enough upon this ſubject, which has not eſcaped the attention of the politicians and philoſophers of the preſent age: I have only to apologize for treating it without declaimation; but I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought, that eloquence can only influence the reſolutions of the moment, and that every thing which requires time, muſt be the work of reaſon. And beſides, it will be an eaſy matter to add ten or twelve pages to theſe few reflections, which may be conſidered as a concert compoſed only of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal parts, <hi>con corni ad libitum.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon reading this paſſage attentively, I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to find it contain a ſingular mixture of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory principles, and in the ſame breath, the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of a philoſopher and of a coloniſt; of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for the Negroes, and of their enemy.</p>
               <p>It is evident that as a philoſopher, and a friend to humanity, you are inclined to alleviate the lot of the Negroes, and commend thoſe who do ſo; but this tenderneſs itſelf conceals a ſubtile venom that ought to be expoſed. For you only beſtow your pity upon the Negroes, while you owe them, if you are a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, vindication and defence; you wiſh their maſters to be humane; they ought to be juſt. Inſtead of praiſing ſuch humanity, you ought to have blamed them for ſtopping there, in ſhort, ſuch a contempt for the Negroes pervades this whole article, as will neceſſarily encourage their tormentors to rivet their
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:020981_0054_0FB169BC0401D548"/>
chains. Is not this contempt obſervable, for inſtance, in the very firſt period?</p>
               <p>"Below this claſs of inhabitants (the meaneſt whites of Virginia) we muſt rank the Negroes, who would be ſtill more to be pitied, if their <hi>natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility did not in ſome meaſure alleviate the wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs inſeparable from ſlavery.</hi>"</p>
               <p>And who told you, Sir, that nature had created the Negroes with leſs feeling than other men? do you judge ſo becauſe they have vegetated for three cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies in European fetters, and at this day have not <hi>altogether</hi> ſhaken off the horrid yoke? But do not their frequent riſings, and the cruelties they from time to time retaliate upon their maſters, give the lie to this natural inſenſibility? for an inſenſible being has no reſentment. If he does not feel, how ſhould he remember? Do you think the wretched Indians, who, ſince the diſcovery of the new world, are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the mines of Peru, are alſo naturally inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe they ſuffer patiently?</p>
               <p>You calumniate nature in making her grant fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to particulars; in giving her a ſyſtem of ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality among her offspring. All men are caſt in the ſame mould—The varieties which diſtinguiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, are the ſports of chance, or the reſult of different circumſtances; but the black comes into the the world with as much ſenſibility as the white, the Peruvian, as the European.</p>
               <p>What then degrades this natural and moral ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility? The greater or leſs privation of liberty; in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as man loſes it, he loſes the powers of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; he looſes the man; he ſickens or becomes a brute. It is ſlavery alone which can reduce a man to a level with the brute creation, and ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives him of all ſenſibility; but you blame nature, that kind parent, who would have us all equal, free and happy, for the crime of ſocial barbarity, and you paſs by this crime, to extenuate another, to extenuate the horrid torments of ſlavery! Not ſatisfied with violating nature, by abuſing her offspring, even in her name, you encourage ſlave-holders to torment them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="unknown:020981_0055_0FB169BF018F75B8"/>Do you not arm their tyrants, when you tell them, the inſenſibility of the Negroes alleviates their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
               <p>What! becauſe greatneſs of ſoul raiſed Sidney a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the terrors of death, the infernal Jefferies <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>This Jefferies was the moſt infamous Chief Juſtice that ever exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in England. Charles IId. and James IId. well acquainted with his talents for chicane, his debauchery and blood-thirſtineſs, his baſeneſs and his crimes, made uſe of him to exterminate, with the ſword of law, all thoſe worthy men who defended the conſtitution from their tyranny.</p>
                     <p>I often quote the Hiſtory of England; unhappily for us it is too little known in France.</p>
                  </note> who cauſed his execution, was leſs guilty! becauſe the Quakers appeared inſenſible to inſults, blows, or puniſhments, they are leſs to be pitied, and it was right to martyr them! A dangerous notion, whoſe conſequences I am ſure you would diſapprove. If this inſenſibility with which you reproach the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes mitigated the cruelty of their maſters, it were well: but their tormentors do not wiſh them not to feel; they would have them all feeling, for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of torturing them; and their puniſhments are increaſed in proportion to their inſenſibility.</p>
               <p>"Seeing the Negroes, ſay you, "ill lodged, ill cloathed, and often overcome with labour, I conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that their treatment had been as rigorous as it is elſewhere. Notwithſtanding I have been aſſured that it is very mild, compared to what they ſuffer in the Sugar Colonies."</p>
               <p>Why this compariſon, which ſeems to inſinuate a juſtification of the Virginians? does a misfortune ceaſe to be ſuch, becauſe there is a greater elſewhere? Was Cartouche leſs deteſtable becauſe Brinvilliers had exiſted before him? Let us not weaken by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons the idea of criminality, nor leſſen the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion due to the miſerable, this were to countenance the crime. The Negroes are ill lodged, ill cloathed, oppreſſed with labour in Virginia: this is the fact, this is the offence. It matters not whether they are worſe treated elſewhere; in whatever degree they are ſo in Virginia, it is ſtill outrage and injuſtice.</p>
               <p>And again, why are the Negroes of Virginia leſs
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:020981_0056_0FB169C0DF4A8368"/>
cruelly treated? Humanity is not the motive, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe covetouſneſs cannot obtain ſo much from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as in the Sugar Iſlands. Was it otherwiſe, they would be ſacrificed to it here, as well as there; how can we praiſe ſuch forced humanity? how, on the contrary, not give vent to all the indignation, which muſt naturally ariſe in every feeling mind?</p>
               <p>"And to do juſtice to both, you add, if the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians are not ſo ſevere, it is becauſe the Negroes themſelves are leſs treacherous and thieviſh than in the iſlands, becauſe the propagation of the black ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies being very conſiderable here, moſt of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes are born in the country, and it is remarked, that theſe are in general leſs depraved than thoſe imported from Africa."</p>
               <p>Here is a ſtrange confuſion of cauſes and effects, and a ſtrange abuſe of words. Firſt let us clear up the facts. Here are ſome valuable ones for the cauſe of the Negroes.</p>
               <p>You ſay they are not ſo thieviſh in Virginia, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate faſter, and are leſs depraved: Why? Becauſe they are leſs cruelly treated—Here is the cauſe and the effect, you have miſtaken one for the other.</p>
               <p>We muſt conclude from this fact, that if the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians were no longer ſevere, and ſhould treat the blacks like fellow-creutures, they would not be more vicious than their white ſervants.</p>
               <p>The degree of oppreſſion is the meaſure of what is improperly called the viciouſneſs of the ſlaves.— The more cruel their tyrants, the more treacherous, villainous and cruel are the ſlaves in return—Can we wonder that Macronius ſhould aſſaſſinate his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Tiberius? This viciouſneſs is a puniſhment that heaven inflicts upon tyranny.</p>
               <p>Can the efforts of a ſlave for the recovery of his liberty, be denominated vicious or criminal? From the moment you violate the laws of nature, in regard to them, why ſhould not they ſhake them off in their relative duties to you? You rob them of their liberty, and you would not have them ſteal your gold! You whip and cruelly torment them, and expect them not
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:020981_0057_0FB169C21F9B27F0"/>
to ſtruggle for deliverance! You aſſaſſinate them eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, and expect them not to aſſaſſinate you once! You call your outrages, rights, and the courage which repulſes them, a crime! What a confuſion of ideas! what horrid logic!</p>
               <p>And you, ſir, a humane philoſopher! are acceſſary to this injuſtice, by deſcribing the blacks in the ſtyle of a dealer in human fleſh! You call what are no more than natural conſequences of the compreſſion of the ſpring of liberty—treachery, theft and depravation<note n="*" place="bottom">Moſt authors who have not deeply ſtudied the rights of men, fall into this error. I have remarked elſewhere [Vol. II. of the Journ. du Licée, no. 4, page 222.) that a writer, who notwithſtanding. deſerves our eſteem, for having written againſt the deſpotiſm of the Turkiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, has ſuffered himſelf to be drawn into it. M. le Baron de Tott ſays, that the Moldavians are thieviſh, mean, and faithleſs. To tranſlate theſe words into the language of truth, we muſt ſay, the Turks, the maſters of the Moldavians, are unjuſt, robbers, villains, and tyrants; and that the Moldavians revenge themſelves by oppoſing deceit to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, &amp;c. Thus, the people are almoſt every where wrongfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed.</note>. But can a natural conſequence be criminal? Remove the cauſe, or is it not the only crime?</p>
               <p>For my part, ſir, I firmly believe, that the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities committed by the Negroes, not merely againſt their maſters, but even againſt others, will be attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the bar of eternal juſtice, to the ſlave-holders, and thoſe infamous perſons employed in the Guinea trade. I firmly believe, that no human juſtice has the right of putting a Negro ſlave to death for any crime whatever, becauſe not being free, he is not ſui juris, and ſhould be regarded as a child or an idiot, being almoſt always under the laſh. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the real criminal, the cauſe of the crime, is the man who firſt ſeized him, ſold him, or enſlaved him—And if ever I ſhould fall under the knife of an unhappy runaway, I would not reſent it upon him, but upon thoſe white men who keep blacks in ſlavery. I would tell them, your cruelty towards your Negroes, has endangered my life—they execrate you, they take me for a tyrant becauſe I am white like you, and the vengeance due to your crimes has fallen upon me.</p>
               <p>God forbid, however, that I ſhould undertake to encourage the blacks to take up arms againſt their
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:020981_0058_0FB169C3975EBA20"/>
maſters! God forbid, however, that I ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to juſtify the exceſſes to which their reſentments have ſometimes hurried them, and which have often fallen on perſons who were not acceſſary to their wretchedneſs! The ſlavery under which they groan, muſt be aboliſhed by peaceable means; and thanks to the active ſpirit of benevolence which animates the Quakers, the prious undertaking is already begun. In moſt of the United States of America, the yoke has been taken from their necks; in others the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea-trade has been prohibited. Societies have been formed both at Paris and London, to collect and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate information upon this intereſting ſubject, to induce the European governments to put a ſtop to the Negro trade, and provide for their gradual eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation in the Weſt-India iſlands: No doubt ſucceſs will crown their views, and the friends of liberty will enjoy the ſatisfaction of communicating its bleſſings to the blacks.</p>
               <p>But the blacks muſt wait for the happy moment that ſhall reſtore them to civil life, in ſilence and in peace; they muſt rely upon the unwearied diligence and zeal of the numerous writers who advocate their cauſe, and the efforts of the humane to ſecond their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; they muſt ſtrive to juſtify and ſupport the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are adduced in their favour, by diſplaying virtue in the very boſom of ſlavery; they muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, in a word, to render themſelves worthy of liberty, that they may know how to uſe it when it ſhall be reſtored to them; for liberty itſelf is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a burthen, when ſlavery has ſtupified the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Such blacks, therefore, as are ſo inconſiderate as to be concerned in inſurrections, are guilty of retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the execution of the general plan for their eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation; for the queſtion is not, at the preſent day, whether a million of ſlaves ought to be ſet at liberty, but whether they can when free, be put into a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of providing for the ſubſiſtence of themſelves and their families. Inſurrections, far from effecting this purpoſe, would deſtroy the means. Regard, therefore, to their own intereſts, if there were no
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:020981_0059_0FB169C52A9594B0"/>
other motive, ſhould therefore engage the blacks to patient ſubmiſſion, and no doubt but they will yield it, if their maſters and the miniſters of the goſpel in particular, to whom the taſk of comforting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing them, is committed, endeavour to prepare them for approaching freedom.</p>
               <p>You ſir, have adopted the vulgar notion, that the Negroes born in Virginia, are leſs depraved than thoſe imported from Africa. You call the firmneſs which is common in the early ſtages of their ſlavery, <hi>greater degeneracy;</hi> they are depraved, that is, in your lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage —they are wicked and treacherous to thoſe who have purchaſed them, or brought them from their own country—But in my mind, they are not depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, becauſe the acts of violence their genius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires them to revenge themſelves upon their tyrants, are juſtified by the rights of nature.</p>
               <p>And why are thoſe imported, more wicked in your opinion? In mine, more quick, more ardent in their reſentments? becauſe, not having forgotten their former ſituation, they feel their loſs the more ſenſibly; and having ſtrong ideas, their reſolutions are more firm and their actions more violent, they not having yet contracted the habits of ſlavery.</p>
               <p>They ſoon fall into that degree of apathy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility, which you unjuſtly believe to be natural to them; that is, in your language, they become leſs depraved; but I would ſay that their depravity begins with this apathy and weakneſs—For depravity is the loſs of nature, and the want of thoſe virtues inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in man, courage and the love of liberty. Our readers may judge from this article, how ſtrangely writers have wreſted words to condemn theſe unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Negroes, and the unfortunate in general.</p>
               <p>I do not, however, pretend to ſay, that the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes of Africa are all good, or even that many of them are not depraved. But is this fact to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them as a <hi>perſonal</hi> crime? Ought you not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have aſcribed it to the foreign ſource by which they are corrupted. Alike in them and in the whites,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:020981_0060_0FB169C67AF02668"/>
the depravity of man is a conſequence of his wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the uſurpation of his rights, Wherever he is free and at eaſe, he is good; wherever the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he is wicked. Neither his nature nor the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate corrupt him, but the government of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Now that of the Negroes is almoſt univerſally deſpotic, ſuch as muſt neceſſarily debaſe and corrupt the Negro.</p>
               <p>How much is the depravity, occaſioned by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his country, encreaſed by his ſecond ſlavery, far worſe than the firſt—for he is no longer among friends in his native land—ſurrounded by the pleaſing ſcenes of his childhood, he is among monſters who are going to live by, and trade in his blood, and has nothing before his eyes but death, or oppreſſion equivalent to an endleſs puniſhment.</p>
               <p>How is it poſſible ſuch horrid proſpects ſhould not fire his ſoul? How, if chance ſhould preſent him with arms and liberty, ſhould he reſiſt uſing them, to put an end to his own exiſtence, or that of his torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors? What white man would be leſs cruel in his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation? Truly I think myſelf of a humane diſpoſition, that I love my fellow-creatures and deteſt the effuſion of blood; but if ever a villain, white or black, ſhould ſnatch me from my freedom, my family, and my friends; ſhould overwhelm me with outrages and blows, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify his caprice, ſhould extend his barbarities to my wife and children—My blood boils at the thought— perhaps in a tranſport of revenge * * * * * * * If ſuch vengeance would be lawful in me, what makes the Negro more guilty? Why ſhould that be called wickedneſs and depravity in him, which would be ſtiled virtue in me, in you, in every white man? Are not my rights the ſame as his? Is not nature our common parent? God his father as well as mine? His conſcience an infallible guide as well as mine? Let us then no longer make other laws for the blacks than thoſe we are bound by ourſelves, ſince Heaven has placed them on a level with us, has made them like us, ſince they are our brethren and our fellow-creatures.</p>

They are not our fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will they ſay: a philoſopher of Paris has proved it.</p>
               <p>What! the blacks not our equals! Have not they eyes, ears, a ſhape, and organs like ours? Does na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture follow another order, other laws for them?— Have not they ſpeech, that peculiar characteriſtic of humanity? But then the colour! What of that?

Have not they the ſame faculties—reaſon, memory, imagination? Yes, you reply, but they have written no books. Who told you ſo? Who told you there were no learned blacks? And ſuppoſing it were ſo, if none but authors are men, the whole human race is different from us.</p>
               <p>Shall I tell you why there are no authors or men of learning among the Negroes? What has made you what you are?

               <p>I have been told that there are blacks of property, in the northern parts of America; but theſe, like the other ſettlers, are no more than ſenſible farmers or traders—There are no authors among them, becauſe there are few rich and idle people in America<note n="*" place="bottom">There was however, a Negro author at London, whoſe productions are not without merit, and were lately publiſhed in two volumes—His name was Ignatius Sancho—He wrote in the manner of Sterne.</note>.</p>

Beſides, the blacks have reaſon to deteſt the ſciences, for their oppreſſors cultivate them but they do not make them better.</p>
               <p>Shall we ſay that the Indians or Arabs are not our equals, becauſe they deſpiſe both our arts and our ſciences? or the Quakers, becauſe they neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect academies nor wits?</p>
               <p>In ſhort, if you will deny the Negroes ſouls, ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, ſenſibility, gratitude or beneficence, I oppoſe you to yourſelf, I might quote your own anecdote of Mr. Langdon's Negro, and abundance of other well known facts in favour of the blacks. You may find ſome ſtriking ones in the Abbé Raynals' philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal hiſtory. One of them would have been ſufficient. The Negroe who killed himſelf when his maſter who had injured him was in his power, was ſuperior to Epictetus, and the exiſtence of a ſingle Negro of ſo ſublime a character, ennobles all his kind.</p>
               <p>But how could you judge whether the blacks were different from the whites, who ſaw them only in a ſtate of ſlavery and wretchedneſs? Do we eſtimate beauty by the figure of a Laplander? magnanimity by the ſoul of a courtier? or intelligence by the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of an Eſquimaux?</p>
               <p>If the traces of humanity were ſo much weakened and effaced in the Negroes, that you did not recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize them, I conclude not that they do not belong to our ſpecies, but that they muſt have been cruelly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented to reduce them to this ſtate of degeneracy. I do not conclude that they are not men, but that the Europeans who kidnap the blacks, are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the name.</p>
               <p>You conſider what precautions it may be neceſſary to take to avoid the danger which might attend a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral emancipation of the Negroes.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not now enter into a diſcuſſion of this nice queſtion, but reſerve it for another work: yet I muſt ſay in a word, that the Negroes will never be our

friends, will never be men, until they are poſſeſſed of all our rights, until we are upon an equality. Civil liberty is the boundary between good and evil, order and diſorder, happineſs and miſery, ignorance and knowledge. If we would make the Negroes worthy of us, we muſt raiſe them to our level by giving them this liberty.</p>
               <p>Thus, the chief inconvenience you expect will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the emancipation of the Negroes, may be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that although free, they will remain a diſtinct ſpecies, a diſtinct and dangerous body.</p>
               <p>This objection will vaniſh when we intermix with them, and boldly efface every diſtinction. Unleſs this is the caſe, I foreſee torrents of blood ſpilt and the earth diſputed between the whites and blacks, as America was between the Europeans and Savages.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, and it is no extravagant idea—perhaps it might be more prudent, more humane, to ſend the blacks back again to their native country, ſettle them there, encourage their induſtry, and aſſiſt them to form connections with Europe and America. The cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated doctor Fothergill conceived this plan, and the ſociety for the abolition of ſlavery, at London, have carried it into exccution at Sierra Leona. Time and perſeverance, will diſcover the policy and utility of this ſettlement. If it ſhould ſucceed, the blacks will quit America inſenſibly, and Sierra Leona become the centre from whence general civilization will ſpread over all Africa.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, ſir, you will place theſe thoughts upon the Negroes with thoſe declamations you are pleaſed to ridicule: But what is the epithet of declaimer to me, if I am right, if I make an impreſſion upon my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, if I dart remorſe into the breaſt of a ſingle ſlave-holder; in a word, if I contribute to accelerate the general impulſe toward liberty.</p>
               <p>You diſapprove the application of eloquence to this ſubject; you think nothing can affect it but the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of cool reaſon. What is eloquence but the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of reaſon and ſenſibility?

can perform wonders, and ſhould be employed by thoſe who undertake to plead the cauſe of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate who ſpend their days in continual agony, or he will make no impreſſion—I do not conceive how any man can diſplay wit inſtead of feeling, upon this diſtracting ſubject, amuſe with an antitheſis, inſtead of forcible reaſoning, and only dazzle where he ought to warm. I have no conception how a ſenſible and thinking being, can ſee a fellow-creature tortured and torn to pieces, perhaps his poor wife bathe in tears, with a wretched infant ſucking her ſhriveled breaſt at his ſide; I ſay I have no conception how he can behold ſuch a ſight, with indifference; how, unagonized and unconvulſed with rage and indignation, he can have the barbarity to deſcend to jeſting! Notwithſtanding, your obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the Negroes, conclude with a jeſt.</p>
               <p>"It will be an eaſy matter, ſay you, to add ten or twelve pages to theſe few reflections, which may be conſidered as a concert, compoſed only of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal parts, <hi>"con corni ad libitum."</hi>

               <p>I hope there is nothing cruel, becauſe there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtudied in this connection, this inconſiderate manner: but how could ſuch a compariſon come into the head of a man of feeling? It is the ſad effect of wit, as I ſaid before; it contracts the ſoul. Ever glancing over agreeable objects, it is unfeeling when intruded upon by wretchedneſs—uneaſy to obliterate the ſhocking idea, and elude the groans of nature, it rids itſelf of both by a jeſt. The humane Benezet would never have connected this idea of harmony with the ſound of a Negro driver's whip.</p>

               <p>And ſo, ſir, you think the people of the preſent day, are a very different ſet of beings from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of old times, and of conſequence, more diſpoſed to and fit for ſlavery—And you blame our philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers too, for putting the people of our day more on a level with thoſe of antiquity, and for aſſerting, that the only difference between them, is owing to the government they live under—Your concluſions, though not avowed, are, that the people of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day are to be kept in a ſtate of the ſevereſt thraldom—for you aſſert that their vices and follies are more numerous, and that their depravity is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediable.</p>
               <p>Now, I maintain, that theſe ſentiments are falſe and detrimental to the people, whom you have thus tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. You have already had my creed on this head.

               </p>
               <p>We may conclude then, that there is no more natural diſtinction between the ancients and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, than there is between the whites and the blacks; and that thoſe which do exiſt, are merely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental —Tranſport the government of Athens to Conſtantinople, and thoſe very Turks who now

appear ſo like barbarians, would equal the Athenians in valour, patriotiſm and knowledge. Liberty would animate theſe machines. The mine is prepared, the combuſtibles are all ready, nothing but the ſpark is wanting.</p>
               <p>Ceaſe then to vilify the people of the preſent day; drive them not to a ſtate of deſperation; but rather try to encourage them, by ſhowing them that their ſtate of degradation is owing to a cauſe which may be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that when it is removed, they will become men.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, I do not rightly underſtand your meaning, when you ſay, that the defenders of the People of our days, have been liberal of their praiſes to tyrants; this is ſaying, that Locke, Sidney, Price, Rouſſeau, Helvetius and Raynal, have commended them; for theſe writers too, have unfortunately been of opinion, that the People of modern times will be quite on a footing with the ancients, when they ſhall be placed in the ſame ſituation.</p>
               <p>But I can clearly ſee, that your ſyſtem is far more favourable to the real oppreſſors of mankind; for by teaching them to conſider the people of the preſent times as unworthy of liberty, and incapable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying it; that the people, and mankind in general are daily degenerating, and will continue to do ſo, even if the cauſe of their degeneracy were removed— I ſay, by teaching ſuch pretended truths as theſe, you encourage their oppreſſors to continue their ſervitude.</p>
               <p>But your ſyſtem is utterly falſe; the revolution of America has clearly proved it to be ſo: for the chief actors of this revolution, are the deſcendants of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen, (who were oppreſſed by the Stuarts,) or of German ſlaves.</p>
               <p>You think to exalt the Americans by putting them on a level with the Greeks and Romans: for my part, I think them vaſtly ſuperior to thoſe ancient nations; But I do not mean to prove my aſſertion at preſent—I ſhall now content myſelf with juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning my ſentiments on this head; and on a future occaſion demonſtrate, that the men of the preſent age, ſo far from having degenerated, will be ſuperior to their predeceſſors, when placed in a more favourable ſituation.</p>

                  <pb n="67" facs="unknown:020981_0068_0FB169D3FB8B1290"/>After having decried the people of the preſent age, you go on to vilify mankind, and the dignity of man, which you look upon as merely comparative, and of courſe, you reckon up the different degrees of the dignity of man. According to your ideas on this ſubject, we have one or two hundred kinds of dignity in Europe, ſuch as the dignity of a Duke, of a Baron, of a Marquis, of a Bailly, &amp;c. &amp;c. What abuſe of words! and what an abominable ſyſtem is here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed —How can you, who are a philoſopher, believe in the <hi>natural dignity</hi> of a nobleman above a plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, of a freeman above a ſlave, or of a white-man above a black?

You will ſcarcely maintain that they are not univerſally true; for ſurely no magic can make any principle true, on the banks of the Delaware, and falſe on the borders of the Seine. I know that theſe prejudices about diſtinctions ſtill ſubſiſt in Europe; but how very unbecoming is it for a philoſopher to be led away by prejudices, and to go ſo far, as to add new force to them by his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
               <p>And how could you make mention of the names of Plebeian and Patrician—thoſe fatal diſtinctions, which brought on all the misfortunes and commotions of the Roman republic; diſtinctions, which involved Rome in perpetual wars, that were favourable to ariſtocratic power; which inſpired her with the luſt of conqueſt, and hurried her on to a deſpotic go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? If Rome had been acquainted with, and had adopted that natural and ſacred equality which the Americans have made one of the pillars of their
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:020981_0069_0FB169D5C7CB3958"/>
conſtitutions, her exiſtence would certainly have been of a much longer duration. It was with a view to theſe principles, that I juſt now ſaid, the Americans were ſuperior to the Romans.</p>
               <p>The dignity of the freeman, compared with that of the ſlave, has at firſt ſight, ſomething more plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it; and yet it is a mere chimera: For by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they both poſſeſs an equal degree of dignity; their natural rights are the ſame—Slavery may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive a man of the uſe of his rights and dignity, but it cannot deprive him of his title to them. The free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould eſteem himſelf happy in being free, but he ſhould at the ſame time, ſympathize with his fellow-creatures who are in ſlavery, and not entertain any ideas of ſelf-ſuperiority. The mean ſlave who glories in his ſituation, is the only proper object of contempt.</p>
               <p>But what can you mean by that ſtrange kind of dignity which you have invented to raiſe the whites above the blacks? What title is there to be found for this dignity and ſuperiority? What author has men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned it? Have not the blacks on the coaſt of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea, who are robbed of their gold duſt, their gums, and their children, by European pilferers, as good a reaſon for arrogating to themſelves a dignity and a ſuperiority over the whites?</p>
               <p>Away, ſir, with theſe contracted ideas of dignity and inequality; they are far more likely than that general or ſpecific dignity which you find fault with, to inſpire men with ſentiments of tyranny and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty towards their fellow-creatures. Theſe anſwer no other end, but that of perpetuating continental, national, civil and perſonal animoſities; and of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the earth the ſcene of eternal diſcord and blood-ſhed. For the antiquity of this inequality, can be of no force in depriving us of our rights or of our ſentiments. It prevents no one from being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that he is, by birth, equal to the man who enjoys the moſt elevated ſtation; it prevents no one from deteſting, according to his feelings, the man who vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olates this equality, by ruining or debaſing his fellow-creatures.</p>

                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:020981_0070_0FB169D86AA8BEF0"/>This is no new doctrine—Rouſſeau had taught it, and Locke and Sidney had taught it before him: It was their opinion alſo, that the wars and crimes of mankind were owing to this inequality, this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative dignity which you are ſo liberal in your praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of, which you cheriſh and deify, under the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of order and ſymmetry—you, the <hi>champion</hi> for equality amongſt the Americans!

The dignity of man conſiſts, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, in the perfect developement of his moral and intellectual faculties, in his efforts to diſcover, and promulgate truth—It conſiſts, in a word, in <hi>great ideas,</hi> in a <hi>ſteady and determined reſolution.</hi> The mere man of the world, who is from his very infancy ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by narrow prejudices, and appearances, which he is continually obliged to give up to, who is always converſant with men of confined ſentiments, and void of reſolution; the mere man of the world, I ſay, poſſeſſes not this dignity; I do not mean to affirm that this principle has not been implanted in his breaſt, or that it cannot expand itſelf when a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opportunity offers; but when ſuppreſſed, it languiſhes and withers—It is revivified by medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the electrifying power of vigorous minds, by holding converſe with the mighty dead, by continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtudying thoſe hiſtories, which afford the noble ſpectacle of an individual oppoſing a tyrant. All theſe ſupports afforded to man, fill his mind with exalted

ſentiments, impel him to the purſuit of noble objects, and determine him boldly to reſolve on performing every thing that is good and ſublime. Having thus explained to you the theory of what I mean by the dignity of man, I ſhall ſhew you, by a few examples, where it has been realized.—A Hampden, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impriſonment, rather than pay an illegal tax; A Sidney, aſcending the ſcaffold <note n="*" place="bottom">I have frequently quoted this celebrated writer; to form a juſt idea of his merits, it will be neceſſary to ſtudy his works with care, and to read Mrs. Macaulay's account of his death.</note> with compoſure; A Locke, unfolding his ideas on civil government; A Rouſſeau, writing his ſocial compact; A Franklin, undergoing his examination with wiſdom and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, before the Britiſh Parliament; A Warren, breathing his laſt in the cauſe of liberty, at Bunker's Hill; A Burke, proſecuting the deſtroyer of the Rohillas, and Tyrant of the Indies — Theſe are great examples, and illuſtrious monuments, of the dignity of man; if you cannot perceive it in ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, I pity you—There are thoſe who will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily diſcover it, men, who have not loſt the ſenſe of their native greatneſs, and of their rights. The Engliſh nation, but more certainly the Americans, will eaſily diſcover it; numbers of them undoubtedly will ſigh on reading this inconſiderate attack of yours againſt the dignity of man: They will naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, why you went to America, ſince you do not believe in the dignity of man; ſince you are only for comparative dignities, which they are either unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, or hold in contempt; and finally, ſince you are for an inequality of rank, which they have excluded, from a belief of its being the ſource of all political evils.</p>
               <p>This is not the only paſſage, wherein you diſcover your contempt for the People; it is manifeſt elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. For inſtance, you deſcribe the People of Pennſylvania, as being more inclined to anarchy, than democracy. I ſhall not now attempt to diſcuſs the motives which dictated this reflection upon the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants

of Pennſylvania, who appear to me, to have in part realized the idea of as perfect a democracy, as it is poſſible to conceive, although perhaps it is too refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the preſent ſtate of things. This is certain, that the word anarchy, has been hitherto greatly abuſed. But I reſerve my ſentiments on this abuſe of words, for another work.</p>
               <p>I have now finiſhed the unpleaſing taſk I impoſed myſelf, in the beginning of this letter. I think I have proved, that you have calumniated the Quakers, the Negroes, the People and Mankind.</p>
               <p>I ought perhaps to extend my obſervations to upon the other numerous errors contained in your tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels; they muſt be dangerous under the ſanction of your name. None of them are unintereſting: but I was not made for a critic, it is too painful an occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for me. I ſhall therefore confine myſelf to a few remarks upon ſome of your ſentiments, and ſuch anecdotes as appeared moſt ſtriking.</p>
               <p>To begin with your opinion on the art of war. You have principally applied yourſelf to a deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the different engagements which have effected the American revolution. You think theſe deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions uſeful for military men, that they will be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſo to thoſe of America; and by the compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence with which you treat the ſubject, we perceive that it is your favourite art, and that you believe it very neceſſary to ſociety, eſpecially in a republic.</p>
               <p>I am entirely of a different opinion, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the uncertainty, and inutility of ſuch deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <note n="*" place="bottom">Marſhal Villars held ſuch plans and deſcriptions very cheap.

I will not enter into thoſe declamations, with which philoſophers are reproached, when they write upon it, and ſhall advance nothing but well atteſted facts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:020981_0073_0FB169DD08280B10"/>The moment you make war a profeſſion, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a body of men who are conſtantly engaged in it, ſtudy it, teach it, and conſequently forſake com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and agriculture; they muſt therefore be maintained by their fellow citizens.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who poſſeſs this art, will employ it to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire fame or wealth, they conſequently deſire, and foment hoſtilities: but republics ought to ſhun war, and eſpecially the ſpirit of it.</p>
               <p>If this art is not employed abroad, it will be at home.</p>
               <p>As the military form a diſtinct body, they think themſelves ſuperior to their fellow-citizens, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe who are peaceable. The prejudice en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes; it renders ſome inſolent, and debaſes others.</p>
               <p>The military art diminiſhes true courage. It is to nations what fencing is to individuals. It ſupplies the place of true courage, but does not inſpire it. But it is with courage only that republics muſt defend themſelves from foreign attacks.</p>
               <p>When men ſhall be thoroughly inſpired with the love of liberty, and accuſtomed to exerciſe it in its full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, they will poſſeſs a ſpirit no military art can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due. The man who exclaims <hi>I will die or be free,</hi> has no maſter; the nation that repeats it, is no longer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved. A conqueror might maſſacre them all, but he could not make himſelf maſter of a ſingle individual. Such courage does not need the ſupport of art or fortifications<note n="*" place="bottom">See an excellent letter of M de la Clos, upon the boaſted utility of fortifications, addreſſed to the academy, on occaſion of the eulogium of Vauban.</note>.

               <p>The real ſtrength of a republic, depends upon the inſuperable attachment of its members to liberty and their rights. Poſſeſſing this, the republican repels every attack, he ſoon learns the military art, he har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſes and overcomes all his enemies: Witneſs many of the American generals, whoſe virtues and abilities you acknowledge.

phyſicians, book-ſellers. Witneſs Warren, Knox, Morgan, Greene, and the infamous Arnold, whoſe talents ſhould have ornamented the ſoul of a patriot. And no wonder that republicans ſo ſpeedily acquire military ſkill. The preſervation of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties engages every faculty; a more powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive than the pay of mercenaries, or even the diſtinctions of European armies. This is the reaſon that one or two years experience, and two or three defeats, inſtruct republicans more than twenty or thirty years ſpent in the ſervice of other govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<note n="†" place="bottom">While we praiſe the Americans for their gallant defence of liberty; we muſt not forget to pay the ſame tribute to the patriotic ardour of our own countrymen.</note>.</p>
               <p>Animated by the love of liberty, republican ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are more patient, and bear fatigue better than hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red troops. Witneſs your own commendations of the American ſoldiers, who always fought bravely, although ill paid, ill provided for, ill cloathed, and unaccuſtomed to the buſineſs. You allow that they ſoon learned to ſerve the artillery, that their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks were of the beſt conſtruction, that they were brave, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.

               <p>They will do well to remember the battles you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, not to ſtudy the plans or circumſtances of them, but as ſplendid monuments erected to liberty. If they are ever obliged to reaſſume their arms, the ſame genius will inſpire them without this ſtudy.</p>
               <p>In a word, every individual of a republic, ſhould be brave, ſhould be a ſoldier, by birth the defender of his country; but none ſhould be ſo by profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

               <p>You alſo compliment us on another account, leſs fatal perhaps, but of dangerous influence upon our manners and conſtitutions; I mean the taſte for ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule, for which you are a warm advocate, and laviſh it upon every thing: You think good epigrams are made no where but in France, and a Frenchman ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffers himſelf to be outdone in this point, ſo much the worſe; Aſia has produced the beſt fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.</p>

               <p>Ridicule accuſtoms us to laugh at abuſes which ought to excite indignation; it produces nothing but a volatile ſenſation, which paſſes off without any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable exertions to remove the evil: The epigram is ſoon forgotten, but the complaint remains.</p>
               <p>It is otherwiſe with a grave people, accuſtomed to reflection in forming a judgment of things: When a writer has demonſtrated to ſuch a people, the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and effects of a public evil; convinced and alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they intereſt themſelves in it, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment perceives and corrects its error<note n="†" place="bottom">To perceive the difference between the effects of ridicule and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal enthuſiaſm, we need only compare the times of la Ligue and la Fronde, in our own country, with the revolutions of 1650 and 1688, in England. Our ſatires were excellent. La Menipée appeared, and Blot and Marigny entertained all France, at the expence of Mazarine: but Mazarine maintained his ground. The Engliſh leſs facetious, obtained the famous <hi>Bill of Rights</hi> which ſecured perſonal liberty, the freedom of the preſs, the right of repreſentation, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
               <p>To reform a people therefore, they muſt be reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the rage for ridicule, and brought back to cool reaſoning. Ridicule is a rattle to amuſe children.</p>

               <p>You regret that our converſation begins to grow dull from being too rational; for you think we are the only people who know how to converſe. Why this inſult to all nations and to truth? Can it be ſaid that we know how to converſe in France, where it is cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary to liſten to nothing, and men of parts eſpecially, thinking themſelves above inſtruction, indulge their own ideas, without attending to yours?

That is to ſay plainly, that you compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our countrywomen, upon being no longer good mothers or good houſewives, and not ſcrupling to deſtroy their poſterity for the ſake of preſerving an elegant ſhape, and pleaſing their unmarried gallants.

               <p>Perhaps, and it is to be hoped, that the ſatires upon the Americans, and their chaſte partners, with which your book abounds, will operate as an antidote to the pleaſing venom it contains. Satires, you will ſay. Yes, caſt your eye over the following liſt, which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends but a very ſmall part of them.</p>
               <p>You repreſent the American women, as being lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle accuſtomed to give themſelves any trouble, and indifferent about every thing, except ſipping their tea, and keeping the houſe clean. Let the reader compare this picture, with that of their virtues, drawn by St. John de Crevecoeur, who has lived ſo long in America, and he may judge how much you wrong them.</p>
               <p>Your informing them in another place, that you did not think any of them handſome, or that they danced ill, is a piece of rudeneſs that French urbani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould have forbidden.</p>
               <p>But your ſatiric vein flows moſt freely, when you bring an old or homely woman upon the ſtage.

But the pen drops from my hand, and I can follow you no longer, for it ſeems to me that your epigrammatic conceits have cauſed you to forget the reſpect due to ſtrangers, to allies, to friends, to good people who gave you a friendly welcome, and vied with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to entertain you.</p>
               <p>If your travels contained information, let them be made public: But muſt it be publiſhed to the whole univerſe if you chanced to meet with an inkeeper who had loſt an eye or was hump-backed? Have you forgotten that every thing which may tend to humble an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual unneceſſarily and undeſervedly, ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and this is always the caſe with natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects? that ſilence is a duty in ſtrangers, whoſe <hi>ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule</hi> may make a laſting impreſſion? Have you forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the reſpect that every writer owes to his readers?

To catch a feature in riding poſt, is to run a riſk of drawing a portrait without a trace of the original.</note> On this principle two thirds of your travels might be retrenched, and the remainder would be leſs imperfect. In juſtice to ſuch of my countrymen who have read your travels I muſt ſay, that your book has made the ſame impreſſions upon them that it has upon myſelf, and no doubt the Americans will be pleaſed to hear it: I therefore proteſt in their names againſt thoſe inferences, which might be drawn from it upon our national character. The Americans may believe me when I aſſure them that many of the brave Frenchmen who have defend-their cauſe, have the higheſt eſteem for their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their manners and their cuſtoms; that they are generally eſteemed in France; and that our different habits have not prevented us from perceiving the full value of their ſimplicity and innocence.

I muſt therefore juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy my bluntneſs. It may poſſibly tend to remove thoſe prejudices which diſcourage the inveſtigation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the progreſs of truth in our country.</p>
               <p>When one writer has attacked another with warmth, we are apt to exclaim: Why ſo ſevere? He might have been treated with decency at leaſt.</p>
               <p>This national diſlike to ſeverity is a proof that vice preponderates and <hi>character is loſt.</hi> Every individual capitulates more or leſs with the duties of his ſtation, and barters his moral obligations for titles or penſions, and every one, conſcious of his own miſconduct, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizing ſome features of himſelf in the portrait of the weak or the guilty man, expoſed to public view, inclines to indulgence, becauſe he ſtands in need of it himſelf; and joins to perſecute the nervous writer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a ſtranger to the ſpirit by which he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated; for innocence itſelf is an offence to the guilty.</p>
               <p>I make no doubt that when Cicero uttered his thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering orations againſt Catiline, there were ſome ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors weak enough to adviſe him to moderation; perhaps in the puſillanimous adage, <hi>we muſt not give offence.</hi> Falſe maxim! Gentleneſs has ever been the ruin of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals as well as communities. Bad men have made but too much advantage of the indulgence of virtue: For which reaſon I think that a virtuous man ought to be uniformly ſevere, that his character ſhould be ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marked, and boldly expreſſed, that he ſhould never weaken his ſentiments, or affect a dangerous modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: truth demands, and the general good requires it.</p>
               <p>Writers, above all men, ſhould obſerve this line of conduct, to render themſelves worthy of the taſk of inſtructing mankind; for how can they expect the confidence of their fellow-citizens, if they condeſcend
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:020981_0082_0FB169ECEA0994D8"/>
to accommodate their principles to circumſtances, or compromiſe with the enemies of the community? They cannot, their influence is juſtly forfeited. It is ſaid they only play their parts, and the wicked remain as before.</p>
               <p>This decided character, now quite loſt among our writers, was univerſal, during the ſixteenth and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth centuries. The civil diſſentions, which then divided the citizens into parties, and impreſſed them with peculiar characters, influenced the writers of thoſe times: Each was attached to a party, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its opponents with rigor. And this was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its uſe: for the apprehenſion of a ſevere cenſure, obliged them to be juſt and accurate. The preſent gentleneſs of cenſure, has been the ruin of ſcience.</p>
               <p>In this reſpect I confeſs myſelf much better pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the manner in which Saumaiſe and Petau, Bayle and Jurieu, treated each other, than with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive ſatires and hypocritical compliments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in our academies, and modern pamphlets.</p>
               <p>It may be objected that abuſe proves nothing. I grant it; but it ſerves to unmaſk a character. What is proved by our perfidious compliments, our cutting-ironies, and our Italics eſpecially? Mere malice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of that frankneſs which might palliate its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity.</p>
               <p>Beſides, abuſe is too often applied to that boldneſs of feature, wherein the man of virtue is obliged to paint the villain. What! ſhall Locke or Sidney, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing the doctrines of the deteſtable Filmer, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to treat him with delicacy and tenderneſs? No: living or dead, let infamy brand the villain.</p>
               <p>Such a character as theſe two great men poſſeſſed, can never be concealed; it will appear in the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomy, the geſtures, the ſpeech, the writings of its poſſeſſor Men of cooler tempers, ſtrive to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage it, by ſtarting difficulties in its way, and the friends of the party ſecond their endeavours from prudential conſiderations; but if it is deeply rooted, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition only forces it to expand itſelf, which is a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the public, as well as for the individual who is ſo ſtrongly organized. He poſſeſſes in himſelf an
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:020981_0083_0FB169EF1B0874B8"/>
ample recompenſe for every inconvenience to which it may ſubject him. Such a one, like the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of antiquity, ought to conſult his ſecret geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us upon every occaſion. It is the nymph of Numa, the demon of Socrates, and the ſpiritual light of the Quakers. He ought to liſten to it, with unceaſing attention, and ſpeak when it inſpires.<note n="*" place="bottom">Great men who are invariably animated by a ſpirit of this kind, have always had cauſe to repent, when they have neglected to pay implicit obedience to its impulſes. Hampden. the friend of Sidney, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of the ſame crime, at firſt choſe to ſhare his fate; but impelled by the preſſing ſolicitations of his friends, he conſented to caſt himſelf upon the king's mercy, and ſaved his life at the expence of a puniſhment worſe than death itſelf: for he reproached himſelf for his weakneſs, all the reſt of his life, and at laſt put an end to his miſery by ſuicide.</note> Its inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions never decieve thoſe whoſe primary object is the public good, nor can they fail of general utility.</p>
               <p>With ſuch a character, it is impoſſible to be a cool ſpectator of ſcenes that ſhock every feeling of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, or remain unmoved at the ſight of general calamity and injuſtice.</p>
               <p>The generality of our writers preſerve their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration amidſt theſe ſhocking ſcenes: They treat even criminals and oppreſſors, with civility and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, becauſe they have neither ſpirit, nor charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Notwithſtanding, we muſt do juſtice to ſome late writers who have boldly defended the rights of mankind. This generous zeal has penetrated even to the bar, and the preſent year has given riſe to ſpirited memorials, in favour of oppreſſed innocence. Their authors not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining themſelves to the defence of their clients, have extended their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations to general liberty, the ſocial compact, the duties of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the faults of miniſters and the miſconduct of inferiors, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways more obdurate and oppreſſive, than their maſters. Some of the moſt remarkable of theſe memorials are thoſe of M. Thilorier, that juſt publiſhed by M. Lacretelle, in favour of the unfortunate Comte de San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis, and thoſe in particular, written by my reſolute and intrepid friend, M. Bergaſſe, againſt the villains who have ſo long perſecuted M. Kor<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mann.</note> Shall I tell you the reaſon of this? Independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of other general cauſes, it may be attributed to their way of life. Conſider how a great character is formed, and then caſt your eye upon the life of one of our writers.</p>
               <p>A nervous character, is the reſult of a natural eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſentiment, an habitual indignation at the ſight
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:020981_0084_0FB169F085C109A8"/>
of oppreſſion, and frequent meditation, which tends to preſerve the ſoul from the external cauſes of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral lethargy and decay; in a word, it is the reſult of a man's conſtant communion with his own heart or with ſuperior objects.</p>
               <p>But how rare are theſe habits! can ſuch meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be enjoyed amidſt the hurry and diſſipation of a metropolis: yet here our geniuſes are ſent to receive that poliſh which is often fatal to every bold and original quality. Here they connect themſelves in ſocieties, communicate indiſcriminately with each other, or with men of weaker minds, and thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe themſelves. Intereſt or habit, accuſtom them to praiſe whatever they meet with in theſe ſocieties, and ſo the public is deceived. Is it worth while to undeceive it? All muſt live—and to live in peace, muſt avoid giving offence. Upon this principle, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, character, and independence, are ſoon loſt, and the cauſe of truth is ſerved only as it ſuits convenience.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you will ſay that all this has been in print twenty times before—granted; it has been twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty times true, is now ſo for the twenty-firſt time, and is ſtill neceſſary to be repeated, for the evil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains unreformed. It may alſo be affirmed, that truth, virtue and reformation, are only to be expected from the man who devotes himſelf to ſolitude and obſcurity. Elevated ideas, bold reſolutions, in a word, great characters are formed in ſolitude; and what can be expected from ſuch a man, but ſeverity of cenſure, which, notwithſtanding, is by no means incompatible with kindneſs or urbanity. Authors ſhould be friendly when they meet, ſhould cheriſh and aſſiſt each other in caſes of neceſſity, and beſtow their applauſes when merited; but they ſhould alſo openly, candidly and vigorouſly, oppoſe each other, when wrong. Thus Price and Prieſtly, Kirwan and Cavendiſh, now treat each other in England. They are friends as far as is conſiſtent with truth. Thus the patriot Jebb, treated the celebrated Charles Fox. Although inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately connected with him in private life, he warmly oppoſed him in his writings, and in all public aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="unknown:020981_0085_0FB169F22A5E5BF8"/>Theſe are the examples I propoſed to myſelf for imitation. Whenever opportunity offered, I have paid a juſt tribute of eſteem to your uſeful treatiſe de la Felicité Publique; I cannot therefore be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of prejudice in this reply to your ſatires upon the Quakers, the Negroes, and the dignity of man. They excited concern and indignation in my breaſt: I have expreſſed what I felt; if the warmth of my feelings has ſometimes hurried me too far, aſcribe it to the importance of the object; but do not ſuſpect me of a wiſh to offend you: it always was and always will be far from my intention.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, I have freely cenſured ſuch parts of your travels as appeared to me to deſerve blame, or lead to deſtructive conſequences, I am not the leſs inclined to do juſtice to your intereſting enquiries, and your juſt encomiums upon thoſe celebrated charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters who have contributed to reſtore the freedom of America.

            <head>POSTCRIPT.</head>
            <p>I HAD juſt finiſhed this letter, when a friend handed me the review of your travels, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the <hi>Mercure</hi> of the firſt of July.</p>
            <p>The following paſſage in which the Quakers are mentioned, ſtruck me particularly: "A converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>one</hi> Mr. Benezet leads the author to ſpeak of the Quakers. Some think he has not done them juſtice. We alſo doubt whether his reproaches may be generally deſerved by them. The religious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>theſe people</hi> do not inſpire them with bad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, beſides it appears improbable that theirs ſhould differ from thoſe of their fellow-citizens, &amp;c. &amp;c."</p>
            <p>I do not know the writer of this article. Whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he was, it is aſtoniſhing that he ſhould take the liberty to ſpeak in this contemptuous ſtyle of Mr. Benezet and the Quakers. He could not be ignorant that the article <hi>one</hi> before a proper name is never ſo applied in our language but to men of contemptible characters: he could not be ignorant, that the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>thoſe people,</hi> is inſulting and blends a body of valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men with what we call the vulgar: If he was not ignorant, how dared this journaliſt to make uſe of ſuch expreſſions, to deſcribe an individual and a ſociety who are equally reſpectable? Where is the man in all Europe, of whatever rank or birth, who is equal to Benezet? who is not obliged to reſpect him? How long will authors ſuffer themſelves to be ſhackled by the prejudices of ſociety? Will they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver perceive that nature has created all men equal— that wiſdom and virtue are the only real criterion of ſuperiority? Now who was more virtuous than Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezet? who more uſeful to ſociety, to mankind? What author, what great man, will ever be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his grave by four hundred Negroes, ſnatched, by his own aſſiduity, his own generoſity, from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, wretchedneſs, and ſlavery? Who, then, has a right to ſpeak haughtily of this benefactor of men?</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the Quakers, after having conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the abſtract here given, of their religious, moral
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:020981_0087_0FB169F5275D4158"/>
and political principles, it muſt excite indignation, to hear them deſcribed under the contemptuous appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>thoſe people.</hi> Shall nothing be honored but titles, rank, or ſplendor? and will authors always conſpire with the favourers of ariſtocracy, to place the modeſt and ſimple virtues below titles, to which they are infinitely ſuperior? On looking over what you ſay againſt the Quakers, I ſee with concern that you have not only uſed a like expreſſion of contempt yourſelf when ſpeaking of Benezet, but that you have even affected to <hi>thee</hi> and <hi>thou</hi> him in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Permit me to make a remark upon this ſubject, which eſcaped me before: It is a principle of the Quakers, to reject thoſe ceremonious expreſſions, which have been invented by vanity or meanneſs. They cannot ſee any <hi>natural</hi> difference in their fellow-creatures, ſufficient to authorize a diſtinction in their addreſs or deportment toward each other. The prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſaying <hi>you</hi> to a ſingle perſon, appears to them falſe and abſurd. Whether they are right or wrong, in this reſpect, it is equally certain, that plain lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage cannot be rude in them. They uſe it among themſelves, whatever relation they bear to each other: they uſe it to every body. But it does not follow, that thoſe who are not of their ſect, who have not their principles, or way of thinking, ſhould ſpeak in the ſame ſtyle to them. It would not only be very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polite to do ſo, but a miſplaced familiarity: yet plain language is not a mark of familiarity in the Quakers. Without departing from their <hi>thee</hi> and <hi>thou,</hi> they are careful to acknowledge the reſpect due to merit, to age, and to authority; and are decently reſerved in their addreſs to ſtrangers. They know what good breeding requires, and are pleaſed with reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful treatment as well as the reſt of the world: for they are at no loſs to account for the affected plainneſs of thoſe whoſe manners and principles are not conſiſtent with ſuch behaviour. It muſt appear to them either a miſplaced familiarity or the miſtake of ignorance, which being unable to comprehend the motive of their cuſtoms, thinks to
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:020981_0088_0FB169F679C5EEA8"/>
flatter them by a conformity to one of the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. Or indeed (as is moſt commonly the cafe) from that contracted ſelf-love which is mortified by ſuch bluntneſs, although it is univerſal and without reſpect of perſons. In a word, they are ſenſible that plainneſs of ſpeech is not contemptuous in them, but that it is ſo in other people, unleſs dictated by friendſhip or conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. There is another abſurdity, ſir, in this review: its author doubts the juſtice of your charges againſt the Quakers, becauſe, ſays he, <hi>their religious principles do not inſpire them with bad morals.</hi> As if any religious principles inſpired bad morals!—as if all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a ſect muſt neceſſarily be honeſt men, becauſe its principles are good!—as if there had never been any Proteſtant or Catholic rogues, becauſe Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant or Catholic principles do not inculcate roguery! Contemptible argument! weak defence! only cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to confirm the public in the idea you give of the Quakers, which it is evident that the fawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or cowardly author of this article did not care to oppoſe.</p>
            <p>Such criticiſm is a diſgrace to the man who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to give the public the true character of a book. He ſhould be perfectly maſter of the ſubject it is written upon. And, to return to the Quakers: if this writer muſt give his opinion between you, he ſhould have been well acquainted with Barclay's Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, and every other publication in their favour, but eſpecially the letters of M. St. John de Crevecoeur; or if he had never read them, he might have confeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ignorance, and kept his judgment to himſelf.</p>
            <p>If I were inclined to diſcuſs moſt of the other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles in this review, it would be eaſy to demonſtrate that almoſt all of them are ſtamped with the ſame marks of frivolouſneſs, ignorance, and adulation.</p>
            <p>Every thing is praiſed down to the very table of contents, perhaps, becauſe your dinners and ſuppers are faithfully regiſtered there, and not a ſingle fact is criticiſed, not a ſingle idea<note n="*" place="bottom">I am aſtoniſhed that he ſhould ſuffer your contemptuous expreſſions ſo liberally, and often unjuſtly beſtowed, to paſs entirely unnoticed. For inſtance, I meet with the word 'babbler,' in three different places, and it is miſapplied in them all. A brave hatter is ſtigmatiſed with it, who had forſaken every thing to defend the liberties of his country, and after travelling four hundred miles on foot to join the American forces, had diſtinguiſhed himſelf by a gallant action. He relates it to you very ingenuouſly, and you reward his civility with the opprobrious epithets of babbler and braggart. It is applied in another place to a reſpectable officer, who had taken care of a poor old man that was bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by a mad dog, and whoſe good qualities might have apologized for the failing if he had been guilty of it, which does not appear to have been the caſe, And laſtly, you apply it to the good woman who ſheltered the unhappy girl, whoſe ſtory ought not to have been expoſed to the world, although this babbler, as you call her, had prudence enough to anſwer your enquiries by replying that it would be too tedious to relate. How many more ſuch remarks might I have made! But they were neceſſarily ſacrificed to the important truths which I had pledged myſelf to defend.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="unknown:020981_0089_0FB169F80B029E68"/>We muſt both agree, that people of quality and men of eſtabliſhed reputation have a ſad privilege in France; it is that of receiving nothing but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe. As criticiſm is never wholly free with reſpect to them, this incenſe is never pure; and the diſgrace of their works, ſo pompouſly announced, ſhews them ſooner or later, that encomiums obtained from mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by <hi>prudential</hi> conſiderations, will not entitle them to the eſteem of their own age, much leſs to deſcend to poſterity.</p>
            <p>I muſt give you one inſtance, ſir, of the puſillanimity of writers of the lower claſs towards privileged authors: it relates to yourſelf.</p>
            <p>I was lately in company, when the converſation turning upon your travels, an author related, that not long ſince he could not help conceiting you frowned upon him, at table, and aſked the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who ſat next him, what could be the reaſon of it, who anſwered, M. Le Marquis de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellux believes you to be the author of the article againſt his travels, in the <hi>Correſpondence Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teraire Secrette:</hi> he has been told that you write for it. For Heaven's ſake undeceive him directly; I have no hand in it; I did not write that article. Why need you deny it ſo warmly? replied I; the work may deſerve criticiſm. That may be, rejoins my gentleman; but I would not attack M. de Chaſtellux;
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:020981_0090_0FB169F979071730"/>
he has the ear of M. de Monteſquieu, who is in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with Monſieur the King's brother: it would be the ruin of me; I have a wife and children to provide for. Well, ſir, replied I, I am a father and a huſband as well as you, but I will criticiſe theſe travels, and that openly: for I have too good an opinion of M. le Marquis de Chatellux not to believe, that if I ſhould be perſecuted for it (which but to ſuppoſe, were abſurd and injurious to the perſons you mention) he would himſelf be the firſt to defend me. Indeed it appears to me, that every judicious man, who regards his own intereſt, ſhould be of the opinion of Lycurgus upon public diſcuſſions. This paſſage of Plutarch is ſo ſtriking, and you are ſo great a lover of antiquity, that I am tempted to tranſcribe it entire.</p>
