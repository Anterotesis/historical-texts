            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is obſervable, that the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> in the preceeding Verſes, addreſſes his Exhortations and Admonitions to the Chriſtians, to whom he directs this Epiſtle, under the ſeveral Titles or Appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Fathers, Young Men,</hi> and <hi>Little Children;</hi> which Titles, or Characters, ſome underſtand as reſpecting the Diverſity of the Degrees of Grace, that obtain among Chriſtians, who according to their Standing and Proficiency in the School of Chriſt, are variouſly deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, in Alluſion to the natural Age; ſome, <hi>Fathers,</hi> from their Age and Experience in Chriſtianity, their Wiſdom and Knowledge of ancient Things; ſome, <hi>Young Men,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:008104_0004_102E2B9C90287D68"/>from their ſpiritual Strength, and Fortitude, fitting them for Conflicts with <hi>Satan</hi>'s Temptations, and for obtaining the Victory over them; ſome, <hi>Little Children,</hi> from their knowing God as a Father.—Others conceive theſe Diſtinctions to refer to the Diverſity of the natural Age. And it is generally agreed, that the Words may be aptly accommodated to both Sorts, either to the ſeveral Ranks of Chriſtians, differing from each other in Regard of their Growth in Chriſtian Knowledge, and Holineſs, as Fathers, young Men and Babes in Chriſt; or to the Diverſity or Diſtinction of Chriſtians with Reſpect to their natural Age. And it is without all Doubt, that the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in general (as well as this Epiſtle) were written for the Uſe and Benefit of Chriſtians, in common, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Rank or Age of human Life, old, or young. And there are in the Word of God Counſels, Inſtructions, and Encouragements, peculiarly adapted to Perſons of every Age, particularly to young Men; they are counſelled and exhorted to <hi>remember</hi> their <hi>Creator in the Days of</hi> their <hi>Youth,</hi> (Eccl. 12.1.) and caution'd againſt <hi>walking in the Ways of</hi> their <hi>Heart, and in the Sight of</hi> their <hi>Eyes.</hi> (Chap. 11.9.) <hi>Solomon</hi> declares it his Deſign in writing his <hi>Proverbs, to give unto the young Man Knowledge and Diſcretion.</hi> (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.4.) And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> inſtructs <hi>Titus</hi> to give proper Advices to the Aged and Youth; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to <hi>exhort young Men to be ſober-minded.</hi> (Tit. 2.6.) There are alſo Examples of pious young Men ſet before them for their Encouragement and Imitation. Such was <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s Family. (Gen. 39.2,—9.) Such was <hi>Joſiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> who, <hi>in the Eighth Year of his Reign, while he was yet young</hi> (about the Sixteenth Year of his Age, for he <hi>began to reign, when he was Eight Years old) began to ſeek after the God of David his Father.</hi> (2 Chron. 34.1, 3.) Such was <hi>Obadiah,</hi> who <hi>feared the Lord from his Youth,</hi> (1 King. 18.12.) and others that might be named. And they were young Men in Age ('tis probable) as well as in Grace, to whom this Addreſs is made by the Apoſtle, giving them a
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:008104_0005_102E2B9E1CC77268"/>great Commendation for their ſpiritual Fortitude, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and vanquiſhing Satan, that <hi>Wicked one,</hi> thro' the Word of God abiding in them. <hi>I have written unto you, young Men, becauſe ye are ſtrong; and the Word of God abideth in you,</hi> &amp;c.—And they are the young Men of this Flock, whom I propoſe now to addreſs, agreable to theſe Words of the Apoſtle; young Men, who deſire to bear and receive the Word of God, and of whom it may be hop'd, that his Word, both <hi>written</hi> and <hi>preached.</hi> will <hi>abide</hi> in them, to ſtrengthen them unto ſpiritual Conflicts with, and Victory over Satan's Temptations, and thereby furniſh them for good Service to God, and their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And happy thoſe young Men, who are not only young in <hi>Age,</hi> but young Men in <hi>Grace,</hi> and in Chriſtian Knowledge and Practice, <hi>ſtrong</hi> Men in Chriſt; in whom this Character, and Commendation may be verified, <hi>Ye are ſtrong to overcome the wicked one,</hi> having the <hi>Word of God abiding in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall briefly open the Words, and then apply them for Inſtruction and Exhortation to our young Men, under ſome Heads of Doctrine. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We may take Notice of the Perfection aſcrib'd to theſe Young Men, which is, that they <hi>are ſtrong.</hi> As old Men are fain'd for Wiſdom; <hi>With the Antient is Wiſdom</hi> (<hi>Job</hi> 12.12.) So young Men, for Strength. <hi>The Glory of young Men is their Strength.</hi> (Prov. 20.29.) Old Men are therefore fitteſt for Counſel and Advice, (hence it is noted as an Inſtance of great Weakneſs and Indiſcretion in <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> that <hi>he forſook the Counſel of the old Men</hi> 1 King. 12.13.) as young Men are for Execution by their bodily Strength, which is moſt eminent in thoſe of that Age. But it is ſpiritual Strength which is here intended, and the Effects of it are ſpiritual, in the Conqueſt of the Wicked one. And thoſe who are young in Grace, are to be commended for this Strength, whereby they are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to overcome their Luſts, and to reſiſt Temptations.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:008104_0006_102E2BA0AE1E51F8"/>
2. The Means of this Strength is the <hi>Word of God abiding in them.</hi> Strength of the Mind, which is here ſpoken of, lies in ſtrong Reaſons, which beget Reſolution, whereby the Mind is fortified againſt all Solicitations to turn aſide from the Way of Truth and Righteouſneſs. And the Word of God affords the ſtrongeſt Reaſons, to eſtabliſh the Heart againſt Satan's Temptations; taken from the Evil of Sin, the Excellency, Pleaſure and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Ways of Holineſs, the Death of Chriſt for the Expiation of Sin, the Love and Mercy of God towards repenting Sinners, the awful Judgment to come, the Horrors of Hell, and the Happineſs of Heaven, all clearly revealed in the Word of God. And thoſe who have this Word abiding in them, as a Principle of the ſpiritual Life, deeply rooted in their Hearts, are thereby well furniſhed with Strength againſt their ſpiritual Enemies. The Word of God is the great Weapon of our ſpiritual Warfare. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.17.—<hi>The Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The main Evidence, or Effect of this ſpiritual Strength, thro' the Word of God abiding in them, is their Victory over Satan, who is <hi>the Wicked One,</hi> and all his Luſts and Temptations;—<hi>and have overcome the Wicked One.</hi> He cannot mean a full and final Conqueſt; for <hi>that</hi> is not to be expected till the End of Life. <hi>Then</hi> (and not before) our Warfare ſhall be accompliſhed, and we paſs from this militant State to the triumphant; but the Victory was begun at their firſt Converſion, when they firſt embraced the Holy Religion of Chriſt, being enabled by divine Grace to renounce the Devil, and all his Works, and to overcome all the Oppoſition he could make againſt their Entrance into the Kingdom of God. And this was a real Victory over that Wicked one, and an Earneſt and Pledge of a full and compleat Victory at laſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Deſcription and Commendation he gives of theſe young Men in Chriſt, that he might the better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the Exhortations to Holineſs, which he writes to them in this Epiſtle. <hi>I have written to you, young Men,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008104_0007_102E2BA42CCF63C8"/>for ye are ſtrong,</hi> &amp;c. And in preſſing any Branch of Duty, certainly one of the moſt effectual Methods to gain our Point, eſpecially with young People, is, to take Notice of and commend the Beginnings and Appearances of it in them, or ſuch Inſtances of virtuous Goodneſs, as they have already attain'd unto: this, beſide the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Duty exhorted to, will excite a laudable Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to go on, and make good the Commendation given them, in a more eminent Degree.—But I ſhall endeavour further to explain theſe ſeveral Heads of the <hi>Text,</hi> in a few Obſervations from it.</p>
            <p>DOCT. I. That it is the Duty, and will be the Commendation, Honour, and Happineſs of young Men, to be ſtrong to overcome the Wicked one.</p>
            <p>DOCT. II. The Means of acquiring this Strength is the Word of God, our receiving it into our Hearts, and having it abiding in us.</p>
            <p>DOCT. III. That young Men, even ſuch as have experienced the effectual ſaving Impreſſion of the Word, are to be exhorted, and encouraged to the Duties of Chriſtian Piety, by the Word of God, written or preached. I can ſpeak but briefly to each of theſe Points.</p>
            <p>DOCT. I. That it is the Duty, and will be the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, Honour, and Happineſs of young Men, to be ſtrong to overcome the Wicked one. Here I ſhall make a few Remarks in general, for Illuſtration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By <hi>the wicked one</hi> is meant the Devil. This is the Character he bears in the Writings of this Apoſtle. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Not as Gain who was of that wicked one,</hi> (i. e. the Devil, who was a <hi>Murderer from the beginning</hi>) and ſlew his righteous Brother. He had ſaid before, ver. 8. <hi>He that committeth Sin, is of the Devil.</hi> This he exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in <hi>Cain,</hi> who was of that <hi>wicked one,</hi> the firſt-born of <hi>Satan.</hi> So <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.18. <hi>He that is begotten of God, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf; and that wicked one toucheth him not.</hi> And he is elſewhere in Scripture ſtiled <hi>the wicked one.</hi> As in our Saviour's Parable of the Tares, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.38. <hi>The Tares are the Children of the wicked one,</hi> i. e. the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008104_0008_102E2BA5C4A78F10"/>of the Devil; ſo 'tis explain'd in the next Words, <hi>ver.</hi> 38. <hi>The Enemy that ſowed them, is the Devil.</hi> And in the old Teſtament we meet with the ſame Appellation. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.6. <hi>Set thou a wicked Man over him; and let Satan ſtand at his right Hand.—Aynſworth</hi> tranſlates it, <hi>Set in Office the wicked one over him.</hi> The Pſalm is a prophetick Imprecation againſt <hi>Judas,</hi> the Betrayer of our Lord; as appears from the Application of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 8th <hi>Verſe</hi> to <hi>Judas,</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 1.20. And we know, the Devil had full Power given him over <hi>Judas,</hi> to hurry him on to his unnatural Treaſon againſt his Maſter; and after that, to lay violent Hands on himſelf. There are many wicked ones among the Children of Men, but the Devil is eminently and emphatically called <hi>that wicked one;</hi> being himſelf, the firſt in Wickedneſs, and fix'd in Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and Malice againſt God, and Holineſs. <hi>The Devil ſinneth from the Beginning.</hi> (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8.) He was the <hi>firſt</hi> Rebel, and Ringleader in Sin and Rebellion againſt God. 'Twas he that ſeduced our firſt Parents to that great Tranſgreſſion, which has involv'd all Mankind in Sin and Death. And he has made it his Buſineſs ever ſince to draw and entice others to Sin and Wickedneſs; and is the Father of all Sinners among Men. <hi>He that committeth Sin, is of the Devil.</hi> (ibid.) <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil</hi> (ſaid Chriſt to the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi>) <hi>and the Luſts of your Father ye will do.</hi> (Joh. 8.44.) He is the <hi>Enemy of all Righteouſneſs;</hi> and that malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apoſtate <hi>Spirit, that works</hi> in all <hi>the Children of Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</hi> (<hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2.) He works in the Hearts of all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed People by their Luſts and corrupt Paſſions, inſtigating them to evil Practices. Juſtly therefore may he be ſtiled the wicked One.</p>
            <p>But note here. Tho' he be called the <hi>wicked One,</hi> in the ſingular Number, yet we are not to think, that there is but one ſingle wicked Spirit, that goes by the Name of the <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> in Scripture; if ſo, ſurely, he could not carry on his wicked Deſigns with Men, all over the World, without having a Sort of Omnipreſence
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008104_0009_102E2BA96E528928"/>aſcribed to him. But the Scripture repreſents their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to be very great. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> terms them wicked Spirits, in the plural. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. <hi>We wreſtle not againſt Fleſh and Blood, but againſt ſpiritual Wickedneſſes</hi> (<hi>Marg.</hi> Wicked Spirits) <hi>in high Places.</hi> There is an innumerable Company of theſe apoſtate Angels, many Legions of them. We read, not only of ſeven Devils, that were caſt out of one Woman (<hi>Luk.</hi> 8.2.) but of a <hi>Legion</hi> of Devils, which Chriſt caſt out of one Man. (<hi>Mar.</hi> 5.9.) "Notwithſtanding the great Employment the Devils have among Men, walking to and fro in the Earth, to preſerve and enlarge their Empire among the Children of Diſobedience, we ſee they could ſpare an whole Legion to take Poſſeſſion of one Man." How vaſt then muſt their Number be? And when we read of the Devil or Satan, in the ſingular Number, it is ſuppos'd, that the grand Devil is intended, who is called <hi>the Prince of Devils. Matt.</hi> 12.24. For he is repreſented as having a Kingdom in Oppoſition to the Kingdom of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 26, 28. And there is a vaſt Number of theſe apoſtate Spirits in Confederacy with the Arch-Devil, in the Rebellion againſt God; who are called the <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>the Devil. Rev.</hi> 12.9. <hi>The Dragon was caſt out—and his Angels with him. Matt.</hi> 25.41.—<hi>Everlaſting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> And it is ſuppos'd to have been one of thoſe Angels of Satan, with whom <hi>Paul</hi> had that Conflict, mentioned 2 Cor. 12.7.—<hi>There was given me a Thorn in the Fleſh, a Meſſenger of Satan to buffet one.</hi> And ſince they have all one common Intereſt, being combined together againſt God, and Chriſt, and Holineſs, and the Salvation of Men's Souls; therefore whenever any one Angel of Satan aſſaults any particular Perſon with his Temptations, the Devil is ſaid to tempt him. And whenever ſuch an Angel of Satan is reſiſted or overcome, the Devil or the wicked One is ſaid to be overcome, as if he were but one ſingle evil Spirit; becauſe they all hold together in one common Intereſt, being united in Oppoſition to the Souls of Men.</p>

2. The Things implied in overcoming this wicked One are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this wicked One is an Enemy, the great Enemy of our Souls. All Victory ſuppoſes Oppoſition from an Enemy we have gotten the Maſtery of: and the three great Enemies we are called to encounter in this our warfaring State, are the Fleſh, the World, and the Devil. But of theſe, the Devil is the principal; the World and the Fleſh are his Auxiliaries; the World ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the Matter of his Temptations. either the Pleaſures and Gratifications of Senſe, or the Terrors of Senſe; the Fleſh or carnal Luſts are the traiterous Party in our own Boſom, which are ready to betray us into the Snares of Satan; and by theſe Means he ſeeks to circumvent, and ruin us. Wherefore Satan is to be conſider'd as our Enemy in a three-fold Reſpect, either as a Tempter, an Accuſer, or a Tormentor.
<list>
                  <item>(1.) As a Tempter. Herein he plainly ſhews his Enmity, that by tempting Men to ſin againſt God and tranſgreſs his Laws, he might deſtroy them in Soul and Body forever. This was his Aim in tempting our firſt Parents to a Revolt from God: and what Ruin has he thereby bro't on Mankind? And this mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Deſign he purſues in all his Temptations ever ſince, whereby he has been ſeducing the Children of <hi>Adam.</hi> In this his tempting Work (how plauſible ſoever he appears in his Temptations to deluded Sinners) <hi>he goes about as a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8.) Hence he has his Name, <hi>the Tempter.</hi> 1 Theſſ. 3.5.—</item>
                  <item>(2.) As an Accuſer. Having tempted Men to ſin, he accuſeth them to God, that he may obtain a fuller Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of them, and greater Power over them. So that Imprecation againſt <hi>Judas</hi> may be underſtood, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. 6. <hi>Set a wicked Man</hi> (the wicked One, or the Devil) <hi>over him,</hi> i. e. Let him be given up to his Power, to hurry him to the Sin of betraying his Maſter; and then, <hi>Let Satan ſtand at his right Hand,</hi> as an Accuſer, to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. The Right Hand being the Place in the antient Judicatories where the Accuſer ſtood. Thus this
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008104_0011_102E2BAC938B8270"/>inveterate Adverſary manifeſts his Enmity, not only againſt wicked Men, who are wholly under his Power, but even againſt pious and good Men; as he is repreſented in <hi>Zechari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s, <hi>Viſion,</hi> as accuſing <hi>Joſhua</hi> the High Prieſt of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Zech. 3.1. <hi>He ſhewed me Joſhua the High Prieſt ſtanding before the Angel of the Lord, and Satan ſtanding at his Right Hand to reſiſt him.</hi> So he accuſed <hi>Job</hi> of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy in ſerving God with a mercenary Spirit. <hi>Job</hi> 1.9, 10, 11. <hi>Satan anſwered the Lord, and ſaid, Doth</hi> Job <hi>fear God for nought?</hi> &amp;c. Hence he is ſtiled the <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren.</hi> Rev. 12.10. But they are, for the moſt Part, falſe Accuſations that he prefers againſt the People of God: but if they are not altogether groundleſs, they have an Advocate in Heaven, who effectually pleads for them.—</item>
                  <item>(3.) As a Tormentor. Hence he is ſaid to have the Power of Death. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.—<hi>that thro' Death he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him that had the Power of Death, that is, the Devil.</hi> He is permitted in the righteous Judgment of God, to have the Power of Death, or of excuting the Curſe on thoſe who have given up themſelves to the Power of his Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So he that was their Tempter, having ſucceeded therein, is appointed to be their Tormentor.</item>
               </list> —In all theſe Reſpects the Devil is the grand Enemy of Mankind; but chiefly as a Tempter: For as an Accuſer and Tormentor he could have no Advantage againſt them, unleſs he had firſt play'd his Part ſucceſsfully as a Tempter; and as ſuch, we are therefore principally concern'd to withſtand this Enemy. This inviſible Solicitor to Evil is little tho't on by careleſs Sinners, while they are intent on the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of their Luſts and carnal Imaginations; they are not ſenſible of the Agency of any inviſible Spirit, that is buſily at work with, or upon them; are ſenſible of no other Influence they are under, than the Sway of their own natural Appetites and Paſſions. But if we believe divine Revelation, we are aſſur'd thence, that there are <hi>ſpiritual Wickedneſſes</hi> (or <hi>wicked Spirits</hi>) <hi>in High Places,</hi> which are the <hi>Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World,</hi> and <hi>work</hi> powerfully in all the Children of Diſobedience. There
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008104_0012_102E2BB3B1096BC8"/>are vaſt Multitudes of theſe infernal Spirits, buſy with Men all over the World, endeavouring to draw, or drive them to Vice and Wickedneſs, or to divert them from their Duty. And tho' Satan has no immediate Knowledge of the Hearts of Men, nor immediate Acceſs to them, yet he may be able to reach and affect the Powers of their Souls by Means of the corporeal Organs, that Imagination and bodily Spirits and Humours which fall under his Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance; and being a moſt ſubtle Spirit, is able to inſinuate himſelf into their Fancies, which have a great Influence on their Wills and Affections, and thereby excite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame their Luſts and Paſſions; and by Means of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Imaginations and Paſſions of Men, he has a great Advantage for enforcing his Baits of Temptation. But whether we are able to account for the Manner of the Devil's tempting Men or no, the Thing itſelf is real and undoubted, that he has a ſtrong Hand in carrying Men out to all the wicked Acts of their Lives. Some more heinous Sins are more immediately from the Inſpiration of Satan, ſuch as the Sin of <hi>Judas</hi> (<hi>Joh.</hi> 13.2.) ſuch alſo as Blaſphemy, unnatural Sins, Self-murder, and the like: but in more ordinary. Sins there is more of the Hand of Satan than Men are commonly aware of, and more than even good Men are aware of: When <hi>David</hi> was ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to the Sin of numbring the People (for a Sin it was in God's Account, and by <hi>David</hi>'s Confeſſion, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.7, 8.) we can hardly perſuade ourſelves, that he was at all ſenſible of the Agency of Satan in that Affair, or that the Reaſons that mov'd him to it, were fetch'd from Hell; but it is affirm'd in the Word of God, 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1. <hi>And Satan ſtood up againſt Iſrael, and provoked David to number Iſrael.</hi> He has a greater Advantage againſt us, becauſe we are ſo unobſervant of him. This wicked one watches all Occaſions for carrying on his wicked Deſigns; he is a vigilant Adverſary, therefore we are required to <hi>be vigilant</hi> in oppoſing him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. Hence are thoſe frequent Cautions againſt the Wiles and Temptations of this ſubtle Adverſary, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.3—<hi>Leſt Satan tempt you
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008104_0013_102E2BB542417FD8"/>for your Incontinency.</hi>—2 Cor. 2.11. <hi>Leſt Satan ſhould get an Advantage of us.</hi>—1 Theſſ. 3.5.—<hi>Leſt by ſome Means the Tempter have tempted you, and our Labour be in vain.</hi> 1 Tim. 3.7.—<hi>Leſt he fall into Reproach, and the Snare of the Devil.</hi>—Eph. 4.26.27. <hi>Let not the Sun go down on your Wrath: neither give Place to the Devil.</hi> Which implies, that the Devil has an Influence in raiſing and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting wrathful Paſſions, and by harbouring and indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them we give Place to him, and give great Advantage to his Temptations. All which Cautions ſpeak our Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from this Adverſary as a Tempter; and as ſuch we are particularly concern'd to withſtand him.</p>
            <p>And let me add,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The wicked one, as a Tempter, doth in a peculiar Manner aſſault young Men with his Temptations; both young Men in Age, and young Men in Grace. As God calls moſt earneſtly for the youthful Age to be dedicated to, and employed in his Service, <hi>Remember thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth.</hi>—Mic. 7.1. <hi>My Soul deſired the firſt ripe Fruit.</hi> So the Devil peculiarly beſtirs himſelf by his Temptations to gain over young Men to his Party and Intereſt, as hoping for more Service from them, than from any other Age. But if they be alſo young Men in Chriſt, they may chiefly expect his Aſſaults, who have by Converſion entered on the Ways of Religion and Holineſs, or who begin to mind Religion in good Earneſt, and to ſet their Faces <hi>Zion</hi>-wards. Theſe Beginners in Chriſtianity Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan bears a Spite againſt, and purſues them with his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, if poſſible, to bring them back to his Service again, or otherwiſe to diſturb their Peace and Comfort, and weary them in the Service of God. As Chriſt, as ſoon as he was baptiz'd and ſolemnly conſecrated to his Office, and own'd as the Son of God, was tempted by the Devil, <hi>Matt.</hi> 4.1. And as the Chriſtian Church, in the Viſion of <hi>John,</hi> under the <hi>Emblem</hi> of a <hi>Woman cloathed with the Sun,</hi> &amp;c. when <hi>being with Child, cried, travailing in Birth, and pained to be delivered,</hi> i. e. ſtriving with great Earneſtneſs, Labours and Conflicts in her Miniſters, under Perſecutions and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008104_0014_102E2BB6CDAC3E80"/>to bring forth Children to God, <hi>The Dragon,</hi> (i. e. the Devil, that cruel and Blood-thirſty Adverſary) <hi>ſtood before the Woman—to devour her Child, as ſoon as it was born.</hi> i. e. (as it may be interpreted) to aſſault and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy (if poſſible) her young Convert: ſo young Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans muſt expect Encounters from Satan, either by the Frowns or Flatteries of the World, and by the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Luſts of their own Hearts, aſſon as they ſet out in the Ways of Godlineſs; and ſhould prepare accordingly, And the Ground of this Enmity of the Devil, againſt the new-born Chriſtian, we have intimated in the Curſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt the old Serpent, which involves a Promiſe in Favour of Mankind, Gen. 3.15. <hi>I will put Enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed.</hi> Wicked Men, whilſt in their Apoſtacy from God, are in Confederacy with Satan, who is the Head of the apoſtate World. But by converting Grace, God puts a Principle of Enmity into the Sinner's Heart againſt the Devil and all his Works; and ſo breaks off that Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy: And then, no Wonder this malignant Adverſary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ſhow his Enmity againſt God and Holineſs, in purſuing the new Convert with his Temptations and fiery Darts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Thing implied in overcoming the wicked One, is a ſtriving againſt, or reſiſting this Adverſary. All Victory ſuppoſes a preceeding Combat or Struggle with an Enemy, and our Victory over Satan is not an imaginary, but a real Thing; and therefore not to be obtain'd but by a vigorous Reſiſtance, and many Times by fore Conflicts. There muſt be a <hi>ſtriving for the Maſtery,</hi> and <hi>fighting</hi> in good earneſt, and <hi>not as beating the Air.</hi> (1 Cor. 9.25, 26.) But here, we are not to conſider the Devil as an external Foe, or our War with him, as lying abroad, at a Diſtance from us; but as one that has a mighty Party within us, by whoſe Means he carries on all his Oppoſition againſt our Souls: And the Seat of this War is in our own Souls. For (as we have obſerved) the Three grand Enemies that fight againſt us, are the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008104_0015_102E2BB8595FFCA8"/>and as of theſe Three, the Devil is the principal, ſo the moſt dangerous is the Fleſh, or fleſhly Luſts of our own Hearts; thoſe <hi>Enemies of our own Houſe,</hi> thoſe Traiters in our own Boſoms, which are in the Intereſts of the Devil, and the World; and as they do, of themſelves, war againſt our Souls, 1 Pet. 2.11. <hi>Abſtain from fleſhly Luſts, which war againſt the Soul</hi>—So they often betray us unto the Devil's Snares, and the Power of the World's Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 'Tis by theſe that the Devil and World prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. So that the Conteſt, in Effect, lies between the <hi>'Spirit</hi> and the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> as the Apoſtle has repreſented it. Gal. 5.17. <hi>The Fleſh luſleth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh; and theſe are contrary the one to the other.</hi> Or between an enlighten'd Conſcience, and corrupt Luſts and Paſſions, which have different Intereſts, and draw ſeveral Ways. Conſcience is on God's Side, and takes his Part in Behalf of the Soul. Carnal Luſts are on the Devil's Side, and take his Part againſt the Soul. If we yield to the corrupt Motions and Luſts of our own Hearts, we give Place to the Devil; but if we reſiſt theſe with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and Reſolution, we reſiſt the Devil, and put him to Flight: for he can have no Advantage againſt us, but what we give him by our own corrupt Luſts, in yielding a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with his Temptations. 'Tis therefore our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, to join in heartily with God and Conſcience, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the carnal Inclination, and in ſuppreſſing and mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſleſhly Luſts. This Method of ſtriving for the Maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over our ſpiritual Enemies, the Apoſtle has recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own Example, 1 Cor. 9.26, 27.—<hi>So fight I, not as one that beateth the Air; but I keep under my Body</hi> (i. e. the corrupt Appetites and Luſts of the Body; and the Body itſelf, in Subordination to the Soul) <hi>and bring it into Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</hi> And the Fleſh being thus ſubdued, and kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der due Government and in Subjection to the Dictates of Reaſon, and the Rules of Religion, the Devil and the World may tempt in vain. And to maintain this Reſiſtence, we are directed to <hi>put on the whole Armour of God,</hi> Eph. 6.11. The ſeveral Parts whereof are deſcribed, <hi>ver.</hi> 13,—18.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008104_0016_102E2BBC89725D90"/>The Meaning whereof in general is, that we ſhould be in the daily Uſe and Exerciſe of thoſe ſeveral Graces, and Means of ſpiritual Strength, which ſerve as an Armour to withſtand our ſpiritual Enemies, and to defend our Souls againſt the malignant Effects of their Aſſaults: As Faith, Repentance, Self-Denial, Abſtinence, the Word of God, and Prayer; to which muſt be joined conſtant Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as our Saviour hath directed, Matt. 26.41. <hi>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into Temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence I proceed to ſhew.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Wherein conſiſts our Victory over the wicked One? or when, or in what Inſtances may we be ſaid to overcome this Enemy? We have chiefly conſidered him as an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to be reſiſted and overcome, as he is a <hi>Tempter;</hi> never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, he is an Adverſary we have alſo to deal with as an <hi>Accuſer;</hi> and there are many ſad Conflicts with him, as ſuch, which both young Converts, and more improved Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, are expoſed to. But the beſt Way to get the Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory over him as an Accuſer, is by Prevention, by repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Temptations, and maintaining our Innocence and Integrity, notwithſtanding all his Aſſault;; ſo we ſhall prevent his Deſign in feelding Occaſion to accuſe us to God, or render his Accuſations groundleſs, and then they can do us no Harm. But if we yield to his Temptations, in being thereby drawn to Sin, both the Law of God and our own Confciences will join in with Satan, in accuſing and condemning us: In which Caſe (as it but too often happens) the only Way to overcome this Adverſary as an Accuſer, is to have Recourſe to the Blood of the Lamb. Thus the primitive Chriſtians <hi>overcame the Accuſer of the Brethren, by the Blood of the Lamb.</hi> (Rev. 12.10, 11.) In this Caſe we muſt fly to the Patronage of our almighty Advocate Jeſus Chriſt, confeſſing Guilt, and pleading with God the Propitiation in the Blood of Chriſt, and his all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient Merit and Righteouſneſs, to which alone we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ourſelves by Faith, for Juſtification; and by which all Satan's Accuſations are invalidated, to the Believer. And upon this Plea we may ſtand ſecure, and boldly make that
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008104_0017_102E2BC203797338"/>Challenge, Rom. 8.33.34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any Thing to the Charge of God's Elect? it is God that juſtifieth. Who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that died; yea rather, that is riſen again, who is even at the right Hand of God, who alſo maketh Interceſſion for us.</hi> So we may <hi>come off more than Conquerors, thro' him that loved us.</hi> Ver. 27.</p>
            <p>But the Enquiry chiefly relates to our Victory over Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan as a <hi>Tempter.</hi> And then we may be ſaid to overcome the wicked one, when we ſucceſsfully reſiſt his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſtand our Ground, ſo as to defeat his curſed Deſign thereby, either to draw us to Sin and Wickedneſs, or to divert us from our Duty. And the Devil being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, as a Tempter, our Victory over him as an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer and Tormentor, follows of Courſe. And there are Three ſpecial Seaſons, in which we are called to encounter and overcome this ghoſtly Adverſary; which are ſo many Inſtances of our Victory over him.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) At Converſion; when a Sinner by divine Grace breaks thro' all Oppoſition, from the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh, in a reſolute turning from Sin to God. The Devil ſets himſelf with all his Power and Craft to oppoſe and hinder the ſaving Converſion of a Soul. He raiſes all his Forces, from the Fleſh and the World, in Oppoſition to it. The Fleſh, he knows, is in his Intereſt, being whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addicted to the Things of Time and Senſe, whereby he endeavours to extinguiſh all ſpiritual Senſations and Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Soul to God and Holineſs and the Things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove; for <hi>the carnal Mind is Enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to his Law,</hi> Rom. 8.7. And the carnal Mind, Luſts and Imaginations, are the ſtrong Holds of Satan in Men's Spirits; which muſt be caſt down by a ſuperior Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, before they will be captivated to the Obedience of Chriſt. Hence his Poſſeſſion of the Hearts of Sinners, and Dominion over them, our Saviour has repreſented by the Parable of <hi>a ſtrong Man armed keeping his Palace,</hi> Luk. 11.21, 22. And the worldly Baits of Pleaſure, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and Honour, ſuited to the Three capital Luſts, the <hi>Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſts of the Eye,</hi> and <hi>the Pride of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008104_0018_102E2BC6018E6448"/>Life,</hi> are the Armour wherewith the ſtrong Man endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſtrengthen his Poſſeſſion of the Palace (i. e. of the Souls of Men) and does all he can to ſecure it to himſelf, and fortify it againſt the Lord Jeſus. The Devil is ſo mortal an Enemy to the Converſion of Souls, becauſe thereby his Kingdom goes to Ruin, which is founded in Sin and Wickedneſs. And he has often a great Hand in preventing the ſaving Efficacy of the Word for Converſion, in many careleſs Souls, by diſtracting their Minds with worldly Cares, diverting them from a ſerious Attention, filling them with vain Fancies and drawing out their Luſts, that he might intercept the ſaving Profit of the Word; as our Saviour has plainly intimated, Matt. 13.19. <hi>When any one heareth the Word of the Kingdom, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was ſown in his Heart.</hi> The Devil is eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally very active and buſy with Souls under Convictions and Awakenings, either tempting them to Preſumption, perſuading them that ſome ſlight Sorrow for Sin, and a few Words of Confeſſion and Prayer, is enough to intitle them to God's Mercy; and that there is no Need of ſo much Strictneſs and Preciſeneſs, but that they may yet ſafely allow themſelves in ſome carnal Liberties, and after all hope in God's Mercy for Pardon and Salvation: Or elſe perſuading them that they have Time enough for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and that there is no need of ſo much Haſte in the Maſter; but that they may defer it till, they have taſted the Pleaſures of Sin, and bathed themſelves in the Delights of the Fleſh and the World a little longer, unto a <hi>more convenient Seaſon,</hi> which they promiſe themſelves with <hi>Felix,</hi> Act. 24, 25. and thus the Convictions of many prove abortive.—Or diſcouraging them by repreſenting the Difficulties &amp; Auſterities of a religious Life, to reſtrain them by Fear, or by working on their Shame; ſuggeſting, that they will be laugh'd at by their looſe Companions, as hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical and preciſe.—Or if all this will not anſwer his Purpoſe, but their Convictions are too powerful to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by ſuch ſlighty Methods; then he betakes himſelf
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008104_0019_102DCF510EFC5978"/>to his terrifying Aſſaults, and tempts them to deſpair of God's Mercy, by repreſenting their Sins in ſuch horrid Aggravations, as to leave no Room for Hope; and thus he ſets upon them as a <hi>roaring Lion,</hi> increaſing the Horrors of their Conſciences, by ſetting before them the Terrors of the Law, and concealing from them the only Relief or Remedy bro't in by Goſpel-Grace, urging upon their Minds the deſperate Concluſion, that they are Caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aways, and abandoned by God; and that it is in vain to uſe the Means, to pray, or entertain any Hope of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus the Devil ſets himſelf to oppoſe the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Soul, either by his ſtubtle Wiles, or fiery Darts. Now, in ſuch a Caſe, this malicious Adverſary may be ſaid to be overcome, when an awaken'd Sinner, under deep Conviction of the Sinfulneſs and Danger of his State, breaks thro' all Diſcouragements and Impediments, and with a fixed Reſolution gets over all Oppoſition from within and from without, and with a ſteady Violence preſſes into the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>For the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffereth Violence, and the violent take it by Force.</hi> (Matt. 11.12.) When be not only <hi>ſeeks,</hi> but <hi>ſtrives to enter in at the ſtrait Gale.</hi> (Luk. 13.24.) When he puts a kind of Force upon his corrupt Nature; and notwithſtanding the Temptations of the World, and the Suggeſtions of the wicked One, he is reſolv'd, upon any Terms, to ſecure the Salvation of his Soul: When a Sinner, I ſay, thus reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely breaks thro' all this potent Oppoſition, to get into the Kingdom of Chriſt, this is a glorious Victory; he is already a Conqueror; tho' it is by the Power of divine Grace, that he gets this Victory. And to the Honour of this divine Grace it muſt ultimately be refer'd. 2 Cor. 10.4. <hi>The Weapons of our Warfare are—mighty through God,</hi> &amp;c. Yet the Victory itſelf, in the Work of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Converſion, muſt be the Sinner's own Act, under the Influence of divine Grace. 2 Tim. 2.25, 26.—<hi>If God peradventure will give them Repentance, to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of the Truth; and that they may recover themſelves our of the Snare of the Devil, who are taken Captive by
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008104_0020_102E2BC88DF36940"/>him at his Will.</hi> When God gives Repentance, the Penitent co-operates with the Grace of God, and <hi>recovers himſelf out of the Snare of the Devil,</hi> and ſo overcomes; and in ſtead of being any longer a Captive of Satan, triumphs over him.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Another Inſtance of this Victory over Satan is, when he is reſiſted in any particular ſtrong Temptation, wherewith he aſſaults the Chriſtian. Tho' converting Grace ſets the Chriſtian at Liberty in a great Meaſure from the Power of Satan's Temptations, yet it does not free him from the Aſſaults of his Temptations. Theſe he muſt expect, more or leſs, during his whole Life: but a ſtedfaſt Reſiſtance of this malicious Adverſary is, in Effect, Victory over him. For a Chriſtian not to yield, not to <hi>give Place to the Devil</hi> (as the Expreſſion is, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.27.) but to ſtand his Ground, is to overcome: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.7.—<hi>Reſiſt the Devil, and he will ſlee from you;</hi> he will ſlee as a baffled Enemy. There is no <hi>Medium</hi> in this War, between conquering and being conquered. If therefore, when the Tempter ſeeks by carnal Pleaſures or carnal Fears to turn us aſide from our Duty, or ſolicit us to that which is Evil, we tamely yield to his Solicitation, we put the Victory into his Hand, and ſuffer ourſelves to be overcome by him. But if we ſtand out with Reſolution not to yield upon any Terms, we conquer, and put to flight our Enemy.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The Devilis finally overcome, when a Chriſtian holds out with Conſtancy in this Warfare, until the finiſhing of his Courſe, and ſuffers not himſelf to be ſeduced or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by all the Temptations and Oppoſitions he meets with, in his Way to the Kingdom of God, from the Devil and the World, but approves himſelf a faithful Soldier and Follower of Chriſt unto Death: For to be faithful unto Death, and finally to overcome, are in Effect the ſame Thing. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</hi> To the ſame Purpoſe it follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 11.—<hi>He that overcometh, ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond Death.</hi> Then the Chriſtian Soldier is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008104_0021_102E2BCB5B56EE90"/>Conqueror, and receives the Garland of Immortality from the Captain of his Salvation. The Victory over the wicked one, in the two former Reſpects, the Chriſtian gains in this Life; and this is eſpecially intended in our Text; for the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a Conqueſt already obtained: <hi>Ye have overcome the wicked one.</hi> The final Victory is reſerv'd till the Time that he puts off Mortality, and therewith all the Relicts of Corruption. Then <hi>Satan,</hi> with all his confederate Powers, the Fleſh, and the World, ſhall be entirely vanquiſh'd, according to that Promiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. <hi>The God of Peace ſhall bruiſe Satan under your Feet ſhortly.</hi> Then the conquering Chriſtian ſhall be ſet beyond the Reach of all Aſſailants for ever. The Tempter has <hi>no Place found</hi> for him <hi>in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I add now,</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is much ſpiritual Strength required for get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Victory. As no Victory is to be obtain'd without a preceeding Fight or Struggle, wherein the Strength of the Combatant is tried; ſo this is an Adverſary not to be repell'd or put to Flight by a faint Reſiſtance; but the Exertion of our utmoſt Strength and Vigour is requiſite to that End. For this, theſe young Men are commended, <hi>Ye are ſtrong,—and have overcome the wicked one.</hi> Now Strength is two-fold, natural and ſpiritual. Again, natural Strength is either of the Body or of the Mind. Bodily Strength, tho' a natural Perfection, and the Glory of young Men, who are apt to boaſt in their Strength, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are are able to worſt an Adverſary, yet is no great Excellence, nor properly human; many of the brutal Kind are, for Strength, ſuperiour to the ſtrongeſt Men: <hi>Let not,</hi> then, <hi>the mighty Man glory in his Might.</hi> (Jer. 9.23.) There is alſo the Strength of the Mind and Spirit;—Of the <hi>Mind,</hi> to comprehend and retain a great Number of <hi>Idea's,</hi> and to reaſon with Force and Clearneſs, upon any Subject. And Strength of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to bear up with Alacrity and Vigour under Afflictions and Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>The Spirit of a Man will ſuſtain his Infirmity.</hi> (Prov. 18.14.) But <hi>if thou ſaint in the Day of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008104_0022_102E2BCCEC748610"/>thy Strength is ſmall.</hi> (Chap. 24.10.) And alſo to encounter Dangers with an undaunted Valour, to face an Enemy in the Field of Battle, with a firm and fearleſs Reſolution. This is martial Strength or Courage, ariſing from the Heat of Blood and Spirits. And this Kind of Strength, eſpecially if join'd with bodily Strength, is of great Uſe to the Publick in a Time of War, in thoſe that are called out for its Defence, or engag'd in any military Expedition againſt an Enemy: And it is much to be commended and encouraged in our young Men, who are chiefly (as Inſtruments in the Hand of Providence) our Strength and Defence in a Time of War; and who, as the preſent War continues, may be called forth into the Service of the Publick, againſt the Enemies of our Land; their Fortitude both of Body and Mind, Courage and Valour join'd with bodily Strength, will be likely to do Honour to themſelves, and their Country.—But it is not natural Strength, that is required to combate with, and overcome the wicked Spirit; yea, thoſe that excel in bodily Strength, are often ſome of the chief Slaves of the Devil, and are eaſily taken Captive by him at his Will; while many of a weaker Conſtitution are enabled by divine Grace to ſtand their Ground, and put him to Flight. But it is <hi>ſpiritual Strength,</hi> that is ſuited to this ſpiritual War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, which conſiſts in a firm Reſolution, grounded on the eternal Reaſons of Truth and Righteouſneſs, propounded to us in the Word of God. 'Tis the Strength of the inner Man. Hence that Prayer of the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16. <hi>That he would grant unto you according to the Riches of his Glory, to be ſtrengthened with Might by his Spirit in the inner Man.</hi> 'Tis the Strength of Faith, Hope, Love, Joy, Zeal, Patience; which divine Graces are begotten, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd and invigorated in us by the Word, accompanied by the Spirit of God to our Hearts, and are our Armour of Defence againſt all the Enemies of our Salvation. The Chriſtian Graces, therefore, are often ſet forth in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, under the Notion of Armour, adapted to their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Warfare; particularly 1 Theſſ. 5.8.— <hi>Puting on
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008104_0023_102E2BCE821C11D0"/>the Breaſt-plate of Faith and Love, and for an Helmet the Hope of Salvation.</hi> Theſe Graces in their vital Exerciſe eſtabliſh the Soul, as on a firm Rock, againſt all the Aſſaults the Devil can make upon it, either by the Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Terrors of Senſe. This Strength we derive from Chriſt, by his Spirit, in whom we have both <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.24.) and are therefore directed to depend on him alone for Strength in all our ſpiritual Conflicts; to <hi>be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might</hi> (<hi>Eph.</hi> 6.10.) to <hi>be ſtrong in the Grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1.) This Strength is not of ourſelves; if left to ourſelves, or to the meer Power of Nature, we ſhould every Day be liable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an eaſy Prey to Satan; but it is put into us by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural divine Grace. Hence, when <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>buffetted</hi> by a <hi>Meſſenger of Satan,</hi> be receiv'd this Anſwer from the Lord to his Prayer for Help and Deliverance; <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee: for my Strength is made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Weakneſs.</hi> (2 Cor. 12.9.) <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>Ver.</hi> 10.) <hi>I take Pleaſure in Infirmities,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for when I am weak, then am I ſtrong.</hi> And the Strength of divine Grace in a weak Believer will enable him to carry the Victory over this mighty Adverſury.</p>
            <p>And now, what a commendable Thing? What a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Thing is it, in any Chriſtian, compaſſed with Infirmities, to be able in the Strength of divine Grace to combat with, and conquer this inveterate Enemy of his Soul, the wicked one? What Glory and Renown do earthly Conquerors think themſelves intitled to, who fight but <hi>againſt Fleſh and Blood?</hi> And what Honours and Applauſes are paid them by High and Low, on their gaining any ſignal Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Surely, it is a much more reputable and glorious Thing in the Eye of Heaven, to become a Conqueror in the ſpiritual War, in fighting <hi>againſt ſpiritual Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in High Places;</hi> as the Perfections and Attainments of the Mind are far more noble and excellent than thoſe of the Body. And it is a great Favour of God. and a great Honour that he puts upon a poor ſinful Man, when
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008104_0024_102E2BD190431DD0"/>he is enabled by Strength from above to recover himſelf out of the Snare, and from under the Power of the Devil, and to grapple with and overcome this ghoſtly Adverſary. This will intitle him to the Approbation of God, to the <hi>Euge</hi> and Applauſe of Chriſt, and of holy Angels, which is an Honour, to which there is nothing comparable on Earth.</p>
            <p>And if this ſpiritual Strength, and Victory obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, be juſtly reckon'd a commendable Attainment in any others of the Sons of Men, it is much more ſo in thoſe of the youthful Age, in whom the bodily Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and Paſſions are uſually moſt impetuous, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate to be gratified, which gives Satan a great Advantage againſt them. But it will be an Argument of ſpiritual Fortitude in young Men, highly to their Commendation, to be able to govern their Affections. Appetites, Senſes and Paſſions, and keep them in Subjection to the Rule of Reaſon and Grace, ſo as to defeat the Temptations of the wicked one. Young Men are apt to value themſelves upon their bodily Strength, when they have thereby been an Over-match for an Antagoniſt; yet this which ſeems ſo glorious, hath no Glory in Compariſon of the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Strength, which enables them to ſtruggle with and get the Maſtery of ſpiritual Enemies. For, ſaith <hi>Solomon, He that ruleth his Spirit, is</hi> better <hi>than he that taketh a City.</hi> (Prov. 16.32.) There needs great Strength of Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a wiſe Conduct, for a Man to conquer himſelf and ſubdue his Will and Paſſions to the grave Dictates of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Conſcience. And this is a more honourable and happy Conqueſt, than that which is obtained over an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by outward Force, Blood and Slaughter, which is a Stain to Victory itſelf. And while we keep up the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Command of ourſelves, and keep Poſſeſſion of our own Souls, we fruſtrate the Attempts of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one, and triumph over him; who can have no Power againſt us as a Tempter, but in and from ourſelves. 1 Joh. 5.18.—<hi>He keepeth himſelf, and that wicked one toucheth him not.</hi> Let young Men then ſee here the Way to true Glory. <hi>Shew yourſelves Men,</hi> by preſerving the Dignity
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008104_0025_102E2BD327AAF7E0"/>of your rational Nature, by ſuppreſſing corrupt Affections and Luſts, keeping a watchful Eye, and a ſtrict Hand over that traiterous Party within yourſelves, whence your great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Danger ariſes in this Warfare; in which your main Contention ought to be for the Dominion of Reaſon and Grace over carnal Paſſions and Imaginations, by ſtrictly adhering to the Principles and Precepts of Wiſdom and Virtue. And if you prevail in this Conteſt (which is in itſelf juſtifiable and honourable in the Sight of God, and of all wiſe and good Men) it will redound to your ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Honour. What an honourable Memorial is left of ſacred Record, of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when a young Man in <hi>Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar</hi>'s Family, in his giving that brave Repulſe to the Temptations he was accoſted with from his lewd Miſtreſs? <hi>How can I do this great Wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> (Gen. 39.9.) This was a noble Victory, and 'tis recorded to his Praiſe thro' all Generations. Tho' your grand Enemy be very powerful and politic, yet by the Grace of Chriſt you may overcome; and if you ſtedfaſtly adhere to his Intereſt, in his Strength you ſhall overcome; and the weaker in yourſelves, the more glorious will be the Victory obtain'd in the Strength of divine Grace. 'Tis recorded to the Honour of <hi>David,</hi> that, tho' a Strippling. yet in the Name of the Lord of Hoſts he encounter'd and vanquiſh'd the <hi>Philiſtine</hi> Giant, <hi>Goliah</hi> of <hi>Gath,</hi> and ſilenc'd his inſolent Boaſts and Threats. On which Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, 'tis tho't, he penn'd the 8th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> in which he thus ſings, (<hi>Ver.</hi> 2.) <hi>Out of the Mouth of Babes and Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings haſt thou ordained Strength, becauſe of thine Enemies; that thou mighteſt ſtill the Enemy and the Avenger.</hi> And in the Name and Strength of Chriſt (tho' in yourſelves as weak as <hi>Babes</hi> and <hi>Sucklings</hi>) you may be as ſucceſsful in conquering the <hi>Goliah</hi> of Hell, to the Praiſe of divine Strength, which is made perfect in Weakneſs; at the ſame Time, it will be a great Honour and Happineſs God will beſtow upon you, in making you victorious over this infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Adverſary. By overcoming this wicked one, you will ſhew forth a ſuperior Strength thro' the Grace of the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008104_0026_102E2BD59F547260"/>ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> to that which the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> with all his Perfections in Paradiſe was poſſeſs'd of or at leaſt put in Exerciſe, when tempted to the Tranſgreſſion. Hereby you will in ſame Meaſure retrieve the Honour of the human Nature, that was ſo ſhamefully forfeited and thrown away by our firſt Parents yielding to the Temptations of the Devil; hereby you will gain Re-admittance to the Tree of Life, or a bleſſed Immortality, tho' not in the earthly, yet (which will be infinitely more to your Advantage) in the heavenly Paradiſe; according to that Promiſe of Chriſt, Rev. 2.7. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in the midſt of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much for the firſt Point of Obſervation, which I propoſed chiefly to inſiſt on, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>as it is the Duty of all, ſo it will be peculiarly the Commendation, Honour and Happineſs of young Men, to overcome the wicked one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now add a Word or two to the remaining Heads of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>DOCT. II. <hi>The Means of acquiring this Strength is the Word of God; our receiving it into our Hearts, and having it abiding in us.—Ye are ſtrong, and the Word of God abideth in you,</hi> &amp;c. Or, becauſe the Word of God abideth in you, ye are made ſtrong to reſiſt and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Satan and his Temptations. This ſpiritual Strength we have from Chriſt originally, as the principal Author, communicated to us by his Spirit; but the Word of God (<hi>viz.</hi> in the Goſpel-Revelation) is the Means of its Communication. And this Word is a very apt and proper Means of imparting Strength to the Souls of Men, whether for Duties and Services, or for Sufferings and Trials, or for Conflicts with ſpiritual Enemies; for all which Purpoſes, we need to be <hi>ſtrengthened with Might by the Spirit in the inner Man.</hi> But it is Strength for our ſpiritual Warfare, as the Effect of the indwelling Word, that comes under preſent Conſideration. And the Word of God received and improved by Faith, is the Soul's Strength, whereby it is able to withſtand the ſtrongeſt
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008104_0027_102E2BD83A77AE90"/>Aſſaults of Temptation. It is the <hi>Sword of the Spirit,</hi> which being wielded by the Hand of Faith, never fails to put to Flight our great Adverſary. It was by the ſame Means, that Chriſt vanquiſhed the Devil, when tempted by him in the Wilderneſs; by alledging pertinent Paſſages of Scripture (which the Devil could not withſtand the Force of) <hi>It is written,</hi> &amp;c. Matth. 4.1, 4, &amp;c. And by the Example of our Lord we are taught and encourag'd to make uſe of the ſame Weapon, for repelling the Aſſaults of this Adverſary. But it is the Word of God <hi>abiding in us,</hi> which is of ſuch Force in our ſpiritual Conflict. This Word receiv'd and ſettled as a Principle in the Heart, and conſtantly improved by Faith and Meditation, will be to the young Man a ſovereign Antidote againſt Satan's Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. So, we find it recommended by the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> to the young Man, as the Means of keeping himſelf pure from the defiling Luſts and Temptations of the World and the Devil. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.9. <hi>Wherewith ſhall a young Man cleanſe his Way? By taking Heed thereto according to thy Word.</hi> When the Word not only floats in the Imagination, or furniſhes Matter of Diſcourſe; but ſinks down into the Heart, and is laid up, or hid there, as a choice Treaſure, It will be an effectual Guard againſt Sin and Temptation: as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> goes on to ſay, <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Thy Word have I hid in mine Heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee.</hi> If the Word hath Place and abides in our Hearts, prevailing Luſts ſhall have no Place there; tho' they remain and infeſt us, they ſhall be ſo check'd, and kept under the Power of the Word, that they ſhall not prevail; and ſo Satan's Deſigns ſhall be more eaſily deſeated: for he aſſaults us by theſe Luſts, and hath all his Succeſs from them. Now the Word receiv'd into, and abiding in the Heart, is available to the Purpoſes of our ſpiritual Warfare.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) As it is the Means of quickening us to the Life of God and Holineſs, and thereby puts ſpiritual Strength into us. 'Tis the abiding Word, that is the Principle of the new Life. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Being born again, not of corruptible Seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008104_0028_102E2BDB1FA02548"/>which liveth and abideth for ever.</hi> And there is an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable Oppoſition between this abiding Seed of Grace, and all Sin. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin; for his Seed remaineth in him.</hi> The Word of God abiding in us, as the Seed or Principle of an holy Life, has a ſovereign Efficacy to guard it againſt every Thing prejudicial to this Life.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) As it maintains this ſpiritual Life in Vigour. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. <hi>As new-born Babes, deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby,</hi> i. e. increaſe in ſpiritual Strength, unto a confirmed State of Grace. The Word of God abiding in us, with Reſpect to our ſpiritual War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, is the ſame Thing in Effect with Faith in the Goſpel-Revelation. For it is by Faith we receive the Impreſſion of the Word, and it's abiding Influence on the Heart. And it is Faith that is our main Armour, <hi>our Shield</hi> and <hi>Breaſt-plate</hi> in this ſpiritual War. (Eph. 6.16. &amp; 1 Theſſ. 5.8.) Yea, it is our <hi>Victory over the World,</hi> the Fleſh and the Devil. (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4.) And the holy Diſpoſitions, which correſpond to the Impreſſion of the ſeveral Parts of the Word received by Faith, do ſtrongly fence the Soul againſt all Temptations. So I might go on to ſhew how the ſeveral Parts of the Word, Doctrines, Precepts, Promiſes and Threatnings, contribute to our ſpiritual Strength.— The <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Word exhibit the moſt potent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Arguments to fortify Reſolution for our Conflicts (in which it was obſerved, the Strength of the Mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts) as they diſcover to us the Evil of Sin, and the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it has involv'd us in, and the Method of our Recovery thro' the Grace and Mercy of God in Jeſus Chriſt; the Faith whereof works by Love, which is of ſignal Uſe in our ſpiritual Warfare, as well as Work and Service; and ſerves for a Breaſt-plate to keep the Heart entire for God. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Putting on the Breaſt-plate of Faith and Love.</hi> The Doctrine of another Life, of a Judgment to come, a State of everlaſting Rewards and Puniſhments, are fortifying Conſiderations.—Faith gives Weight and Force to the <hi>Commands</hi> of the Word, by urging the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008104_0029_102E2BE37756B7B0"/>of God upon the Conſcience, which ſtrikes Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations dead.—Faith in the <hi>Promiſes</hi> works by Hope, of the Favour of God, Pardon and Life everlaſting, which Hope is the Chriſtian's Helmet, (1 Theſſ. 5.8.—<hi>And for an Helmet, the Hope of Salvation</hi>) which ſecures the Head, and keeps up firm Reſolution under Dangers and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, and oppoſes the Love and Approbation of God and the eternal Reward, to all the tempting Offers of the Devil and the World—In the <hi>Threatnings</hi> of the Word, Faith works by Fear of Death and Judgment, the Wrath to come and eternal Damnation; which is a mighty Preſervative againſt the alluring Baits of Satan, and the Affrightments of Senſe, whereby he ſeeks to divert the Chriſtian from his heavenly Courſe. There are many ſpiritual Conſiderations ſuggeſted in the Word of God, which tend greatly to confirm the Mind, and are effectual. being applied by Faith, to repel Satan's Aſſaults, and baffle all his Attempts. Men are firſt drawn off from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the grave and ſerious Truths of the Word, which ſhould eſtabliſh their Hearts, before a Temptation can have any Force upon them; for its Prevalency begins here. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Every Man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own Luſts,</hi> &amp;c. But when the Word abideth in us, and our Hearts are ſtored with the holy Truths of it, we have a ſpiritual Weapon ready at Hand, to defend our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and repel the Force of all Temptations. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30.21. <hi>Thine Ears ſhall hear a Word behind thee, ſaying, This is the Way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the Right Hand, and when ye turn to the Left.</hi> But not to inſiſt further on this Head.—Let me ſpeak a Word now to the third and laſt Obſervation.</p>
            <p>DOCT. 3. That <hi>young Men, even ſuch as have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the effectual ſaving Impreſſion of the Word, are to be exhorted and encouraged to the Duties of Chriſtian Piety by the Word of God, written or preached.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' theſe young Men, addreſs'd in the Text, had the Word of God abiding in them, and had Experience of the powerful Effects of it, tho' they had already overcome
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008104_0030_102E2BE507703C60"/>the wicked one; yet the Apoſtle ſees meet to write to them, to inſtruct, exhort, and admoniſh them.—Partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the moſt improved and eſtabliſh'd Chriſtians are yet but imperfect, with Regard both to their Work and Warface, and not paſt all Danger, therefore have Need of frequent Excitations and Cautions from the Word of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.11.—<hi>By them is thy Servant warned.</hi> Much more young Men, who are but Novices in this ſpiritual War. The Apoſtle ſuggeſts, that tho' they had exerted their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in overcoming the Wicked one, in Part, yet they had but enter'd on their Warfare, and muſt not think they are out of Danger, but muſt expect and prepare for new Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, and nor ſuffer the Devil to wreſt the Victory they had obtain'd, out of their Hands; but purſue it to a final and compleat Conqueſt. So his commending them for their ſpiritual Strength, is in Effect exhorting them to the Exerciſe of it in maintaining their Ground, with Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, in their future Conflicts; and a cautioning them againſt fainting under any Trials they might meet with. And ſo his Aim ſeems much the ſame with that of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in writing his <hi>ſecond</hi> Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.17.— <hi>Beware, leſt ye being led away with the Error of the Wicked, fall from your own Stedfaſtneſs.</hi> They had ſhewn their Stedfaſtneſs in the Faith, by reſiſting and defeating their great Adverſary: after this, it would be a Shame to them, to give Ground, and to fall from their own Stedfaſtneſs.—And partly, becauſe the good Impreſſion of the Word once receiv'd is an Encouragement to hope, that the Counſels and Inſtructions of it will meet with proper Entertainment for the Time to come. <hi>I have written unto you, young Men,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. What is it he had written? The Doctrines, Precepts and Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, contain'd in this Epiſtle, eſpecially in the Verſes of the Content: as

            <div type="application">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>I ſhall apply myſelf to the main Deſign of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, in addreſſing our young Men with proper Counſels and Exhortations, agreable to the Mind and Intention of the Apoſtle in our Text.</p>
               <p>I am therefore to ſpeak to you, young Men, in Way of particular Application, what the Apoſtle has here written unto young Men. And it is with Pleaſure I have reflected on it, that it is at your Requeſt I have taken upon me to ſpeak to you in this Manner; and therefore am the more encouraged to ſpeak to you the Word of God in his Name, in Hope that the Word ſo ſpoken may abide in you, to ſtrengthen you to overcome the wicked one, who (you are not to doubt) will be very buſy to oppoſe your Entrance upon, and Progreſs in the Ways of ſerious Piety, as ſoon as you begin to look towards the Kingdom of God. And this is the Subject of the firſt Exhortation I ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs unto you; and then ſhall brieſly preſs the other Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Piety exhibited in the Context.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let me exhort you, young Men, to acquit your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as ſtrong Men in Chriſt, by manfully reſiſting Luſts and Temptations, ſo as to overcome the wicked one: Or in the Words of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.13. <hi>Watch ye; ſtand faſt in the Faith, quit you like Men, be ſtrong.</hi> Eph. 6.10, 11.—<hi>Be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might. Put on the whole Armour of God, that ye may be able to ſtand againſt the Wiles of the Devil.</hi> For your Excitation and Encouragement, let me briefly propoſe to your Conſideration, (1.) This Warfare will admit of no
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008104_0032_102E2BEA27F16338"/>Neutrality. As the Kingdom of Chriſt is diametrically oppoſite to that of Satan; ſo you muſt, of Neceſſity, be on Chriſt's Side, or on Satan's. In this Caſe, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that is not with me, is againſt me.</hi> (Matt. 12.30.) He will endure no Neuters; his Soul nauſeates luke-warm Profeſſors; 'tis not enough, that you don't join with thoſe who are manifeſtly the Children of the wicked one, in open and groſs Wickedneſs; but you muſt heartily join in with Chriſt, and eſpouſe his Intereſt, in Oppoſition to the Devil and all his Works; otherwiſe you will be reput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to belong to the Camp of his Enemies. There muſt be no Peace with Satan. You muſt either fight or die, overcome or periſh. <hi>He that overcometh,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond Death.</hi> (Rev. 2.11.) And what does this imply, but that all others ſhall be ſwallowed up of the ſecond Death? The victorious Chriſtian only is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Seriouſly and ſtedfaſtly reſiſt, and you ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. <hi>Reſiſt the Devil,</hi> and <hi>he will flee from you.</hi> Give a peremptory Denial to his Temptations, and he is defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Devil is a proud Spirit, and cannot bear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction or Oppoſition; therefore where he meets with an obſtinate Reſiſtance, he cannot endure it, but will be gone: Only be ſtedfaſt in your Reſiſtance, 1 Pet. 5.9. <hi>Whom reſiſt, ſtedfaſt in the Faith.</hi> A faint Reſiſtance does but embolden the Tempter to renew his Onſet; but Sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs puts him to Flight; when a Soul is reſolved and fix'd in oppoſing his evil Motions; as it is ſaid of <hi>Ruth,</hi> that when her Mother-in-Law ſaw <hi>ſhe was ſtedfaſtly minded to go with her, ſhe leſt ſpeaking unto her.</hi> (Ruth 1.18.) The Devil has ſome Hope of wavering unfix'd Souls; and therefore plies them moſt ſtrongly with his Temptations. But when a Man is once ſtedfaſtly reſolv'd in his Mind, not to hearken to him, the Tempter is diſcouraged. Here then, a reſolute and ſtedfaſt Reſiſtance is Conqueſt. It is not ſo in other Wars, the moſt valiant Reſiſtance is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways crown'd with Succeſs and Victory; nor is the <hi>Battle</hi> always <hi>to the Strong.</hi> But in this ſpiritual War, a ſtrong
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008104_0033_102E2BEE26344218"/>and perſevering Reſiſtance never fails of Victory. And the Reaſon is obvious, Satan can only tempt by the Baits of the World and the Luſts of the Fleſh; he can't force your Compliance; wherefore to deny your Conſent to his Solicitations, is to conquer. So here the Battle is always to the ſtrong; be ſtrong and ſtedfaſt in the Fight, reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never to yield, and you infallibly overcome.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Conſider the mighty Aſſiſtants engaged for you. Tho' Satan has a ſtrong Party on his Side, the Men and Things of this World, the Corruptions of our Nature, and the Luſts of the Fleſh, the moſt dangerous of all; yet if we belong to Chriſt, and have him dwelling in us by his Spirit and Faith, we have One on our Side greater and mightier than all. 1 Joh. 4.4. <hi>Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the World,</hi> i. e. than the Devil and all his combin'd Forces of the Fleſh and the World. Put yourſelves under the Protection of this mighty Saviour (to whom all the Legions of Devils are made ſubject) by a true Faith, and Self-Dedication to him; and you ſhall be ſafe in his Hand, and find his promiſed Grace and Strength ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for you, to carry you on to Victory and Triumph. And the holy Angels under him are alſo ready to take your Part, and miniſter Aid in this holy War; in which, I doubt not, they are more than bare Spectators: For <hi>are they not all miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them who ſhall be Heirs of Salvation?</hi> (Heb. 1.14.)</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Conſider the glorious Reward promiſed. Rev. 2.7. <hi>To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the Tree of Life—</hi> So, ver. 10. <hi>Be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</hi> Eternal Life, the Life of your immortal Souls is at Stake. This is the Prize contended for. O who would not ſtrive with all his Might to win the Prize of a bleſſed Immortality? Is not this abundant En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement? O <hi>fight the good Fight of Faith, and lay hold on eternal Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is now a Time of War, at Home and Abroad; and the Judgments of God upon the Land in the preſent War are very diſtreſſing: which ſhould awaken all to great
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:008104_0034_102E2BEFB8265808"/>Seriouſneſs, and Reverence of the divine Diſpleaſure; eſpecially you, our young Men, ſome of whom it is likely may be called forth to this external Warfare with viſible potent and malicious Enemies; and if you would be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified againſt all your Fears of other Enemies, ſet yourſelves to encounter and overcome this grand Enemy of your Souls; which you may do by the Grace of God. And if this Enemy be once overcome, you have obtain'd the moſt glorious Conqueſt, and you need to fear no other viſible Enemies. Satan is God's Enemy, as well as yours. And if you fight againſt Satan, you are on God's Side, and then be aſſured that God is on yours. And then you may boldly bid Defiance to all your Enemies, in the Language of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 128.6. <hi>The Lord is on my Side, I will not fear what Man can do unto me.</hi> This will embolden your Confidence in God, in the greateſt Perils you may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to from Fleſh and Blood. The Help on your Side is infinitely ſuperior; for if <hi>God be with you,</hi> and <hi>for you, who can be againſt you?</hi> So you may, again in the Words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> bear up yourſelves above your Enemies; Pſal. 56.4. <hi>In God have I put my Truſt, I will not fear what Fleſh can do unto me.</hi> This will inſpire true Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Magnanimity, when you are called to face an Enemy in the Field of Battle; from a well-governed Perſuaſion of the favourable Preſence of God with you. And you can by no Means more effectually ſecure the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Preſence, than by engaging heartily in this ſpiritual Conflict with God's great Adverſary, the Devil; then you fight in God's Cauſe, and may reſt aſſured of the Protection of the Almighty. Be excited then and animated to this ſpiritual War, and preſs on toward Victory and Triumph with Reſolution and Vigour. Now, tho' the ſinal Victory is reſerv'd 'till hereafter; yet in two Caſes, a real Victory may be won in this Life (as you have heard) <hi>viz.</hi> At firſt Converſion, and in reſiſting particular Aſſaults of Satan.</p>
               <p>Let me preſs theſe two Inſtances—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Be exhorted to ſtrive for the Victory, by preſſing into the Kingdom of Chriſt with Reſolution, thro' all Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:008104_0035_102E2BF14EDF53C8"/>and Diſcouragement, by a ſound and thoro' Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This the Devil oppoſes with all his Might; but herein he has been overcome, in the Strength of Chriſt, by the young Men here written to; and in a Dependance on the ſame Strength, you may and ſhall get the Victory over him, if you reſolvedly ſet yourſelves to turn from all Sin, to God and Chriſt and Holineſs, by a cordial Faith, and Dedication of your ſelves to the Government of Chriſt, renouncing the Fleſh, the World, and the Devil, with all his Works. You muſt expect to meet with much Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion herein, from the Fleſh and the World. Theſe are your old Lovers, from which you may find it hard to be divorced. But perhaps, you are not aware, that all your Prejudices againſt ſerious Religion which hinder your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, all your Objections againſt it, all your Pleas for Delays, all your Diſcouragements ariſing from the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Sins, Fears of being rejected, and the like, are the Suggeſtions of the Devil; but it is certain, that if you yield to theſe Pleas and Objections, when Chriſt earneſtly calls you to Repentance, Faith and Communion with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and as often as you do ſo, you give the Devil the Victory, you obey the Devil, and diſobey Chriſt; as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, as that the Kingdom of Chriſt, and of Satan, divide the whole World. In <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. Chriſt and Satan are bro't in by <hi>Solomon</hi> as Competitors for the Heart of Man, eſpecially of young Men. Chriſt under the Character of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> (<hi>ver.</hi> 1.) inviting Sinners to the rich En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments of ſpiritual Bleſſings which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them; for he deals with Men in a Way of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> by rational Motives and Arguments to engage them to a Compliance with his Calls; and he calls them to nothing but what it is their higheſt Wiſdom to comply with; he calls, <hi>Forſake the Fooliſh and live; and go in the Way of Underſtanding.</hi> (ver. 6.) Satan, on the other Hand, with his Agents and Inſtruments, under the Character of <hi>a fooliſh Woman,</hi> ſoliciting <hi>Paſſengers that go right on their Way,</hi> to <hi>turn in,</hi> to the Entertainments of forbidden Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which he has provided for them. (<hi>ver.</hi> 13, 15.) For
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008104_0036_102E2BF6865A7ED0"/>he deals with Sinners in a Way of Falſhood and Deceit, deluding and befooling them with falſe (tho' pleaſing) Shews and Appearances, to their utter Undoing. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Hearken unto me, O ye Children; for bleſſed are they that keep my Ways.</hi> (Prov. 8.32.) Satan ſaith, Hearken unto me, O young Man, and thou ſhalt have Liberty to <hi>walk in the Ways</hi> of thine Heart, and in the Sight of thine Eyes.—But knoweſt thou not, that <hi>the Dead are there, and her Gueſts in the Depth of Hell?</hi> O how many hopeful young Men, who to Appearance ſet out in the right Way of Virtue and Piety, have, for want of Wiſdom, Caution and Reſolution, been decoyed into the Snares of Satan to their final Ruin, and are in vain lamenting, in the Region of Deſpair, their curſed folly, in hearkning to his Deluſions. But now, if in a Senſe of the Reaſonableneſs of Chriſt's Precepts and Invitations, and under deep Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the important Intereſts of your immortal Souls, and the Neceſſity of doing ſpeedily what in you lies to prevent their eternal Ruin, and ſecure their eternal Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, you ſet yourſelves in the Strength of divine Grace, to break thro' all this Oppoſition from Satan and your own corrupt Hearts, and with a ſteady Zeal and Reſolution preſs into the Kingdom of God, renouncing the Dominion of Sin and Satan, and reſolvedly and unfeignedly dedicating yourſelves to God and his Service, by Faith in his Son Jeſus Chriſt, in ſo doing you overcome the wicked one; you have already gotten a ſignal Victory over Satan, greatly to the Honour and Pleaſure of your Redeemer, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to yourſelves. And I willingly hope, as to a Number of you, at leaſt, the Commendation given the young Men in the Text may be truly applied; that you have been ſtrengthened by the Word and Spirit of Grace, to get the better of the wicked one, by a penitent Return to God thro' Faith in Chriſt; and as to all of you, that you are ſetting your Faces with Reſolution to ſeek the Way to the Kingdom of God, the heavenly Zion; ſo that if not converted, you are in the Way to Converſion: O be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded and encouraged to go on to a thorough Converſion,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:008104_0037_102E2BF90A2CBC80"/>ſurmounting all the Difficulties and Impediments your great Adverſary caſts in your Way; which you may do in the Name and Strength of Chriſt, who has overcome Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and led Captivity captive. Put yourſelves over into his Hand, by an humble ſelf-dedicating Faith, and adhere ſtedfaſtly to his Intereſt, as good Soldiers of Chriſt, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Captain of your Salvation, and he will infallibly give you the Victory. And let this your Converſion be made more evident, to your own and others Satisfaction, by a more ſolemn and publick Dedication of yourſelves to him. Be not aſhamed to declare openly for Chriſt and his Cauſe, and againſt Satan and all his Works and Luſts. This will afford Matter of Joy to Heaven, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound with Applauſes and Acclamations upon this Victory over Satan. Our Saviour tells us, there is <hi>Joy in Heaven over one Sinner that repenteth.</hi> (Luk. 15.7.) All will be well pleaſed there, God and Chriſt, and Angels. The holy Angels rejoice at a Sinner's Converſion. (<hi>ver.</hi> 10.) 'Tis Joy to them to ſee the Ruin of the Devil's Kingdom, and the Enlargement of the Church and Kingdom of Chriſt; they rejoice alſo from a generous Love and Good-will they bear to the Souls of Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I am now to exhort you <hi>to ſtrive for the Maſtery,</hi> by reſiſting the particular Temptations of the Devil, wherewith he may aſſault you, even after your Converſion. And by an effectual Reſiſtance you may get the Victory, yea, many Victories over him in this Life. But here conſider, that as the Devil encounters you by the Luſts and Corruptions of your own Hearts, and cannot faſten one Temptation upon you, but as he finds a corrupt Party within yourſelves, ready to yield a Compliance with it; ſo your main Care and Buſineſs ought to be to reſiſt and ſuppreſs thoſe <hi>fleſhly Luſts, which war againſt the Soul</hi> (1 Pet. 2.11.) as being the Party which holds with Satan againſt your immortal Souls. And your effectual Reſiſtance of theſe corrupt Luſts, is your Victory over Satan; for he is overcome by ſuch Reſiſtance. Here then, you muſt exert yourſelves with Strength and vigorous Reſolution in
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:008104_0038_102E2BFE2BFECD58"/>contending for the Dominion of Reaſon and Conſcience, over carnal. Appetites and Paſſions; and to that End, muſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe yourſelves in Sobriety and Temperance, Self-denial, Prayer and Watchfulneſs, ſtriving to <hi>keep under the Body,</hi> with it's inordinate Affections, <hi>bringing it into Subjection</hi> to the Law of the Mind, as the Apoſtle has directed you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.25,—27. But there is alſo another Way to be recommended, for overcoming Satan's Temptations and the Luſts of your own Hearts, that is, by Flight. Hence are thoſe Counſels and Directions to Chriſtians, <hi>Flee Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.18. <hi>Flee youthful Luſts.</hi> 2 Tim. 2.22. Fly from the Sin you are tempted to, with Abhorrence: hold no Party with Satan, nor debate the Matter, whether you had beſt yield, or forbear; but be reſolute and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in giving a Denial. This will put a Stop to Satan's Attempts, and wholly defeat them. Hence we are taught to <hi>deny worldly Luſts</hi> (2 Tit. 2.12.) to deny their importunate Cravings. And not only to forbear the Gratification of them, but as much as in us lies to extirpate the Luſts themſelves. <hi>Abſtain from fleſhly Luſts.</hi> (1 Pet. 2.11.) Labour to get rid of theſe Luſts, to weaken them more and more in the Work of Mortification, which is the great Duty and conſtant Practice of all real Chriſtians; for <hi>they that are Chriſt's, have crucified the Fleſh with the Affections and Luſts.</hi> (Gal. 5.24.) The greater Progreſs you make in your Mortification of theſe Luſts, the leſs will be your Danger from Satan's Temptations, and the more compleat will be your Victory over them, Therefore arm yourſelves with ſtrong Reſolutions to reſiſt Temptations, and mortify Corruptions, and ſo to defear and vanquiſh this Enemy of your Souls.</p>
               <p>This Conflict with Satan, and Victory over him, is not an airy Notion, but an undoubted Reality (and therefore we are to <hi>fight, not as beating the Air</hi>) tho' the Evidence of this depends chiefly on divine Revelation. Thence we are aſſured, there are vaſt Numbers of apoſtate wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who are irreconcilable Enemies to God and Chriſt, and all Goodneſs; and particularly to the Souls of Men,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:008104_0039_102E2C027B972468"/>and their Salvation; which is atteſted by the ſad Experience of many poor Souls. And we are therein often warn'd of our Danger from them, and directed to proper Methods for our Security. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> calls upon us to <hi>be ſober</hi> and <hi>vigilant; becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>your Adverſary the Devil, as a roaring Lion, walketh about; ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi> (1 Pet. 5.8.) Which was not only true of that Age in which the Apoſtle wrote, but even to this Day. This great Adverſary of God and Man is unweariedly active and induſtrious in the Purſuit of his blood-thirſty Deſign, going about like a ravenous Beaſt of Prey, hunting for the precious Life, even the Life of precious immortal Souls. Nothing leſs will ſatisfy his Malice. Wherefore, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken your Vigilance and Caution, let me put you upon conſidering the Nature and Deſign of this your Adverſary.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) As to his Nature, he is an active, malicious, powerful and wicked Spirit, or rather <hi>Spirits,</hi> in the plural, for (as has been obſerved) there is an innumerable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of them: And the Name <hi>Devil</hi> ſeems to be a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective Term, and applied to the whole Crew. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> terms them <hi>ſpiritual Wickedneſſes,</hi> or <hi>wicked Spirits,</hi> Eph. 6.12. <hi>We wreſtle not againſt Fleſh and Blood,</hi> but againſt wicked <hi>Spirits;</hi> which ſhews our Danger, in that our Enemy is of a ſpiritual Nature. Were we to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict only with Fleſh and Blood, with Men like ourſelves, bodily Strength, which is moſt vigorous in young Men, would be of moſt Service to us; but this Warfare is of a ſpiritual Nature, and requires ſpiritual Strength, Wiſdom Faith, Sobriety, Watchfulneſs, Reſolution. For the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with whom we are to combat, are wicked Spirits; the Devils are Spirits, inviſible to us, and wicked Spirits. And our Danger is the greater from our Enemies, becauſe they are unſeen, and aſſault us ere we are aware of them. Satan is ready to take Men at a Diſadvantage, when they are off their Guard, when their Spirits are ruffled, in their Company, Buſineſs, Enjoyments, when they are leaſt aware of this inviſible Foe at Hand; and being a Spirit, he is able to inſinuate into your Fancies, bodily Tempers, Affections,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:008104_0040_102E2C0531AA8DC8"/>Appetites and Paſſions; and obſerves which Way all theſe work, that he might ſuit his Temptations accordingly, and the more eaſily obtrude his curſed Baits upon you: which is a Reaſon, you ſee, why you ſhould be always upon your Watch, and never give Way to Security.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Let me put you in Mind of the helliſh pernicious Deſign of this your Adverſary in all his Temptations; which is, to prevail with you to ſin againſt God, that he might prevail againſt you to the Ruin of your precious Souls. Juſtly therefore is he called <hi>the wicked one,</hi> it being his great Aim to entice you to Wickedneſs, and to hinder your Repentance; and then he knows, the ſmal Iſſue will be your eternal Damnation. There is this Difference, in Relation to Sin, between the Devil, and Sinners of Mankind. The Devil's <hi>End</hi> is ſinning: but with Men ſinning is ordinarily the <hi>Means</hi> to ſome other End. While you are purſuing the Imaginations of the earnal Heart, you don't aim at ſinning againſt God, or ſin for ſinning ſake, out of pure Enmity to God and Holineſs, which is the right diabolical Temper; but your Aim is at the Pleaſures of Senſe, the Gratification of the Fleſh, or the Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment of the World, and you would doubtleſs chuſe to have theſe Deſires gratified, if it might be, upon caſter Terms, than ſinning againſt God, and wounding your own Conſciences. But becauſe your Minds and Hearts are ſet upon theſe Things, and carried out with a ſtrong Inclination towards them, and cannot obtain them without Sin, therefore it is that you are prevail'd upon to ſin, and break the Law of God. But the Devil has a further Reach, he aims at your Sin and Ruin, and ſo he has a two-fold Deſign which is ſerved hereby. The one is againſt God, to expreſs his malicious Enmity againſt the bleſſed God, by bringing you to diſhonour him by tranſgreſſing his Law. The other is againſt your own Souls, that by the Baits of worldly Temptations ſuired to your Luſts, he might bring you into his Snares, and plunge your Souls in Perdition. This he purſues with a blood-thirſty Eagerneſs in all his Temptations, which ſhould awaken you to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:008104_0041_102E2C085E1BEE78"/>a conſtant Senſe of your Danger, and to a vigorous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, whenever a Temptation ſtrongly inſinuates itſelf into your Minds and Affections; for remembert, hat nothing leſs than your precious immortal Souls are the Prize, which the Devil is thereby contending for.</p>
               <p>Now that you may be ſtrong in ſpirit for this ſpiritual Warfare, let the Word of God dwell and rule in your Hearts. Not only give it a tranſient Hearing, but let it, in the important Senſe and Weight of it, ſink into your Hearts, and form within you a correſpondent Temper. Let it be digeſted by Faith and Meditation, that it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come proper Nouriſhment and Strength to your Souls, and produce and ſtrengthen thoſe Chriſtian Principles of Faith, Love and Hope, which in their genuine lively Exerciſe will be found Armour of Proof againſt all the Aſſaults of your ſpiritual Enemies. Get your Minds and Hearts ſtored with the holy Counſels, Precepts and Inſtructions of the Word: which will abundantly furniſh you with ſtrong Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to oppoſe to all the ſubtle Devices and Allurements of the Tempter; that you may have always this Weapon of your Warfare, <hi>the Sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God,</hi> in a Readineſs to repel the Temptations and fiery Darts of the wicked one: And that in Imitation of our bleſſed Saviour (when tempted by the Devil) you may be able to reſiſt and put to flight this great Adverſary, with—<hi>It is written.</hi> Thus when in Danger of being lifted up with Pride, ſay, It is written, <hi>God reſiſteth the Proud.</hi> (1 Pet. 5.5.) When tempted to murmur under adverſe Providences, ſay, It is written, <hi>Neither murmur ye as ſome of them murmured and were deſtroyed of the Deſtroyer.</hi> (1 Cor. 10.10.) When tempted to tell a lie, or to ſpeak falſely, ſay, It is written, <hi>All Liars ſhall have their Part in the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimſtone.</hi> (Rev. 21, 8.) When tempted to Acts of Injuſtice, ſay, It is written, <hi>The unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> (1 Cor. 6.9.) When tempted to the Sin of Uncleanneſs, ſay, It is written. <hi>God reſerveth the Unjuſt to the Day of Judgment, to be puniſhed; but chiefly them that walk after the Fleſh, in the

Thus let the <hi>Sword of the Spirit</hi> be pointed againſt every Sin that ſolicits your Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and let Faith have the wielding of it; and the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt flee before it. Only let me caution you againſt the prevailing Errors of the Times, whereby the pure Word of God is corrupted, and Satan ſeeks to blunt the Edge of our Weapon, or to diſarm us of our main Strength and Defence. But 'tis <hi>Truth</hi> which is great and ſtrong: <hi>Stand therefore having your Loins girt about with Truth,</hi> the Truth <hi>as it is in Jeſus,</hi> according as you have been taught; and <hi>beware leſt</hi> any of you <hi>being led away with the Error of the Wicked, fall from your own Stedſaſtneſs.</hi>

This therefore ought to be your firſt and main Concern, to keep yourſelves from Sin, from all Sin: in ſo doing you will moſt effectually defeat the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the wicked one, which is to ſeduce you to Sin and Wickedneſs. But by every known wilful Sin you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, you do, as it were, ſurrender yourſelves Captives to the Devil. O then, let little Children, young Men, and all, be exhorted to keep up a Dread of Sin, and keep at the greateſt Diſtance from it.</p>

2. Under a Senſe and Conviction of Sin, you are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Advocacy and Propitiation of Chriſt, in order to Pardon and Reconciliation to God. <hi>Ver.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>If any Man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous; and he is the Propitiation for our Sins.</hi> Forasmuch as <hi>there is no Man that ſinneth not;</hi> and Sins of daily Infirmity will unavoidably attend us in this mortal State; therefore the true and only Method of Relief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Conſciouſneſs of Guilt, is he repointed out to us; which is, repairing to Jeſus Chriſt our great <hi>Advocate</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, looking by Faith to the <hi>Propitiation</hi> in his Blood. An Advocate is one who patroniſes and pleads the Cauſe of an accuſed Party, before any Bar of Juſtice. So Jeſus Chriſt pleads our Cauſe with his Father, againſt the Charge of Guilt, againſt the Accuſations of Satan and our own Conſciences, in the Virtue of his own Merit, or of that propitiatory Sacrifice he once offered on Earth, to make Reconciliation for Iniquity, and ſo ſecures our Peace; that notwithſtanding our daily ſinful Infirmities, we might yet (our Hearts being, in the main, right with God) main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſettled Peace and Comfort, in our Walk with God. Or, if it ſhould be your unhappy Lot at any Time (as it may be, and that even contrary to the ſettled Bent of your Judgments and Reſolutions) to be foil'd by your Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to fall into any more grievous Sin, to the Diſtreſs of your Conſciences; yet having ſuch a ſovereign Remedy provided and offered to you, deſpair not, but fly to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of your Advocate and Mediator; and with deep Humiliation and Contrition of Soul, and by Faith and Prayer plead with God, the Propitiation in the Blood of Chriſt, for the Pardon of your Guilt, and the Healing of your Backſlidings; but be not diſcouraged from perſiſting in your Warfare; but in Dependance on divine Grace and Strength, riſe again from your Falls, and renew the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with freſh Vigour, and with greater Wiſdom, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and Reſolution never to yield: and you may be victorious at laſt; as a General may loſe a Battle in ſome particular Skirmiſhes, and yet come off Conqueror in the Iſſue of War.</p>

               <p>And here, ſuffer me ſeriouſly and earneſtly to preſs it upon you, to improve this great Goſpel-Privilege of the Propitiation or Atonement in the Blood of Chriſt, in order to get into a State of Peace, and Reconciliation with God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Terms of the Goſpel. O how much does it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern you, who may be called to war with Enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, now to get your Peace made with God? And ſo to get <hi>your Feet ſhod</hi> before-hand, <hi>with the Preparation of the Goſpel of Peace</hi> (which is directed to as Part of our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Armour) by ſecuring an Intereſt in that Peace which the Goſpel publiſhes and offers to you. This will ſecure you againſt all the Chances of War. The Devil will be an Enemy to you, whether you be ſo to him, or not. And how dreadful will it be, to have God for your Enemy, and the Devil too: And all Creatures in Heaven, Earth and Hell, in Conſequence of God's being your Enemy! Till you are reconciled, <hi>the Wrath of God abideth</hi> on you: And can you bear the Tho't of lying under the Wrath of an eternal God! But O precious immortal Souls! (for as ſuch I ſpeak to you, in treating with you about the Things of your everlaſting Peace) precious, becauſe immortal. Of what infinite Importance is that reconciled Favour and Love of an eternal God, to an immortal Soul! This will be your Security and Felicity in Life, in Death, and to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. O then, <hi>acquaint now thy ſelf with him, and be at Peace, thereby Good ſhall come unto thee.</hi> (Job. 22.21.) Nothing but what is Good, or works for Good, ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall you; this ſhould raiſe you above the Terrors of your Enemies. Yea, tho' you ſhould fall in Batrie, as good <hi>Joſiah</hi> did, yet you ſhall die in Peace, as God promiſed him. (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.28.) Now, that God is very willing and deſirous of entering into Terms of Peace with you, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from his ſending <hi>his Son to be a Propitiation,</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling Sacrifice, <hi>for our Sins.</hi> (1 Joh. 4.10.) And from
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:008104_0045_102E2C10E5A21438"/>that moving Language of the Apoſtle, 2 Cor. 5.20. <hi>As tho' God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſt's Stead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi> O let not your Conſent be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Terms of this Peace, who will be the only Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by it. Lay aſide your Enmity, and ſubmit to the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of Grace. Let this be your Aim and Purſuit. <hi>And the Peace of God, which paſſeth all Underſtanding, ſhall keep your Hearts and Minds thro' Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. The new Commandment of Love is inforced more largely, <hi>Ver.</hi> 5,—11. This is an excellent Chriſtian Virtue often recommended, in which the true Spirit of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is chiefly manifeſted. It is the Nature and Image of God our heavenly Father; as the contrary, Malice and Uncharitableneſs, is of the Devil, and therefore to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred in every Shape, by thoſe who have renounced the Devil and his Works. There is a general Love, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all Men, in various Inſtances and Degrees; but a more ſpecial Love towards Chriſtian Brethren, and more particularly towards thoſe of your own Society, and with whom you commonly converſe. Let this your Love be generous, pure, cordial and undiſſembled. Let it be not only a Love of common Friendſhip or Courceſy; but a truly religious Love. Let it be manifeſted in counſelling, exhorting, reproving, and edifying one another in the Ways of Religion; in forbearing and forgiving one another; in praying with and for one another. Thus the true Spirit of Chriſtian Love will operate, and evidence itſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Caution againſt immoderate Love of the World, here fitly ſubjoin'd. <hi>Ver.</hi> 15. <hi>Love not the World, nor the Things of the World,</hi> &amp;c. Becauſe the World, and the Things of it, are the common Baits wherewith the Devil ſeeks to ſeduce and enſnare the Souls of Men; and young Men are moſt in Danger of this Snare. While they are ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out in the World, and ſeeking after Settlements and Accommodations in it, they are too apt to ſuffer their Hearts, by worldly Cares and Buſineſs, to be eſtranged from God, and the ſerious Concerns of Religion; and thereby give the Adverſary great Advantage againſt them,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:008104_0046_102E2C14F5EDB9A0"/>to lead them aſtray by <hi>many fooliſh and hurtful Luſts,</hi> which without a ſpeedy Recovery by Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, will <hi>drown them in Deſtruction and Perdition.</hi> (1 Tim. 6.9.) You may, doubtleſs, lawfully uſe the World, attend the Buſineſs of the World in your ſeveral Callings, and enjoy the Comforts of the World: ſtrict Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion allows and requires all this; but all in Subordination to higher and better Things, for which you ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the chief Room in your Affections: that Love to the World, and diſtracting Cares about it, may not divert your Attention from the <hi>one Thing needful.</hi> Labour therefore to get worldly Love mortify'd. To this End, meditate much on the Death of Chriſt: one Deſign whereof was, to deliver you from <hi>this preſent evil World,</hi> and that <hi>the World</hi> might be <hi>crucified to</hi> you, and you <hi>to the World.</hi> (Gal. 1.4. &amp; 6.14.) Think much on your own Death, and live in the daily Views of it, as ſure and near; when all that is ſo much admir'd in this World, ſhall vaniſh as a Dream. What is it, that makes Death ſo bitter and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but an Heart too ſtrongly attached to this World, and corrupted by the Luſts of it? But the Mortification of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Love carries with it Victory over Satan and Death. Let us learn then, to place our Affections on Objects more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſublime, more worthy of an immortal Soul. Let us raiſe our Souls to God and the Things of Heaven, by Faith and Meditation, and ſpiritual Aſpirations. <hi>Unto thee, O Lord,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 25.1.) <hi>do I lift up my Soul.</hi> A Spirit of true Devotion lifts up the Soul to God. Let us then hold on a Courſe of holy Devotion, by daily Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Praiſe, and Converſe with God in his Word and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; which will be an happy Preparation for the Soul's Return to God at Death; that when our Warfare is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, it may return victorious, and our immortal Spirit being looſened from this Clod of Earth, by a previous Work of Mortification, may, upon the Diſſolution of this earthly Tabernacle, mount up to the heavenly Paradiſe, and eat of the Tree of Life and live for ever.</p>
