            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The LIFE of RICHARD BARRICK.</head>
            <p>I RIHCARD BARRICK, was born in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the month of February, in the year 1763, and brought up at the Foundling-Hoſpital: I never could read nor write. At ten years of age I went as an Apprentice to James Saunders, a Silk-weaver in <hi>Spittlefield</hi> Pariſh, lived with my maſter about three years, but he ſtarved and froze me almoſt to death, for which I left him, and roved through the ſtreets, and frequently ſtole ſmall things from ſhop-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.</p>
            <p>I went to <hi>Salt-petre Bank,</hi> and joined a gang of thieves. We ſtole from many people for the ſpace of a year; when I was taken up for ſtealing a handkerchief, and carried before the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> who ſent me to Gaol; I was tried and found not <hi>innocent;</hi> was complimented with thirteen ſtripes, which is continental colours, ſignifying, that I ſhould be honoured in <hi>America</hi> with the <hi>Hibernian</hi> coat of arms, that is, two ſticks <hi>rampant,</hi> one <hi>couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,</hi> a ſtring <hi>pendant,</hi> and an <hi>Iriſhman</hi> at the end of it.</p>
            <p>I joined my old gang again, and continued picking pockets for a year, and then was taken up and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Gaol, and lay there eleven weeks for trial; then I was tried and found guilty. They told
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018559_0003_0FA7B076254C2FF0"/>
me they would pardon me if I would enter on board one of his Majeſty's ſhips; this I conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, but made my eſcape before I got to the ſhip. I returned back to <hi>Salt-petre Bank,</hi> where I joined my old companions in iniquity; went on picking pockets for ſix months, and was apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſuſpicion of Robbery, and was ſent on board a veſſel, in which I came to <hi>New-York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I deſerted and went to <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> and lived with Mr. Volentine Williams; I left him and lived with Mr. Kirk fifteen months, intending to learn the Paper-making buſineſs. During this time, I was as honeſt as the times would allow. I left Mr. Kirk, and went to <hi>Horſe-Neck,</hi> intending to go to the place from whence I came, and follow my old trade of <hi>Baſket Making.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after this I and my comrades went to <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> with an intent to rob James Ulits; but the weather being very ſevere, we turned back. On our return we met with a Britiſh veſſel which we boarded and carried her into <hi>Stanford.</hi> We then went back to Mr. Ulits, in the night, and told him he muſt get up, for his brother's child was very ſick.—He ſuppoſing us to be robbers, called for his firelock: We then forced in at the windows, and demanded his money. He ſaid he had none; but his wife aſked us how much we wanted? I anſwered one hundred pounds, Mr. Ulit went down cellar with a light in his hand, and we followed him; he took a horn from under a hogſhead, which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one hundred and ninety odd guineas. He then attempted to count out our hundred pounds which we demanded; but we told him as he made ſome
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018559_0004_0FA7B076C3B2C318"/>
reſiſtance at firſt, we would take all he had. He then gave us another horn, which contained about forty guineas: Then he gave us a number of dollars. We went out of the houſe, but ſoon concluded that if he had ſo many guineas, it was more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he had ſome other ſort of gold; therefore we went back and demanded the remainder.—Then he gave us another horn containing thirty two half-Joes. we alſo took his plate and clothing, to the Value of four hundred dollars.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, I was taken and put under guard on <hi>Long-Iſland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Colonel ordered me from <hi>Long-Iſland</hi> to <hi>New-York</hi> goal for trial; where I remained three weeks, and then broke goal.</p>
            <p>I returned to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and was there re-taken for the ſame crime, and carried back to <hi>New-York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I broke out the ſecond time and returned to <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I went to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> and there I was taken up and committed to goal for <hi>Burglary,</hi> and tried for my life; but was acquitted. I was taken back to goal and had another trial and found guilty of theft. Then I was ſent back to the work-houſe, to pick oakum for a month and pay fifteen pounds fine. (It may be noted here, that I had been confined in the dungeon in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> ſix weeks before.) I tarried in the work-houſe one fortnight, and then run away and came to <hi>New-York,</hi> there I ſtole a dozen ſilver ſpoons, out of a goldſmiths caſe. Then went to <hi>New-Haven,</hi> and broke open a ſhop, and ſtole goods to the amount of one hundred dollars: And from thence to <hi>New-London,</hi> and met with one of my old friends; he and I broke open a houſe and ſtole ſome clothing. Then went to <hi>Providence,</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018559_0005_0FA7B077785BDF28"/>
there I ſtole a watch out of a man's pocket, but was taken; I gave the man five dollars and his watch, and he ſaid no more about it. I then went to <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and got in company with one Poor; and one John Sullivan (the latter is now under ſentence of death with me) we went to <hi>Winter's-Hill,</hi> and there robbed one Mr. Baldwin, for which crime Sullivan and myſelf are to ſuffer Death, as being the juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of our demerits.</p>

            <head>The LIFE of ALEXANDER WHITE, a PIRATE.</head>
            <p>THIS is to give ſatisfaction to all enquiring friends, that I ALEXANDER WHITE, was born in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in the County of <hi>Tryone,</hi> in the year of our Lord one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſixty-two, and was brought up in the ſaid place, and got what education my parents thought neceſſary. After I grew up my mind being inclined to viſit ſtrange Countries againſt my parent's will. I took my departure from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and went to <hi>England,</hi> and bound myſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice to learn the Mariners art, and ſerved my Maſter faithfully, until it pleaſed him to give up my indentures.</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:018559_0006_0FA7B078401CDAB8"/>
I ſtill followed the occupation of a Mariner, and improved my education until I thought fit to take the command of a veſſel. I have been through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſcenes of life, and always endeavoured to ſupport the character of an honeſt man, and believe that I was harmleſs to any body but myſelf. It is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for me to give an account how I ſpent my life; for I have been in many parts of the world, but never did any thing that would cauſe me to bluſh, or be aſhamed, before I tranſacted this horrid crime that I am to ſuffer for.</p>
            <p>If you deſire to know what this temptation did ariſe from; with ſhame I will endeavour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you: At firſt when I met with Capt. White it was in <hi>Philadelphia.</hi> My money being almoſt ſpent, I agreed to go to <hi>Nova-Scotia</hi> with him. Accordingly we purſued our intended voyage as far as <hi>New-York,</hi> and there we took on board our cargo, and came to a place called <hi>Cow-Harber,</hi> in <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> and there tarried ſome days, and took on board the paſſenger John Vail, and ſailed quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from thence.</p>
            <p>My mind being very uneaſy on account of a young lady whom I propoſed to marry, only the want of money prevented our being joined in the bands of Hymen. Being below her degree, and being aſhamed to own my neceſſity, prolonged our being joined in wedlock. But love began to burn my poor and wounded heart; and being reſolved to go through any difficulty that might impede us, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to take the life of my fellow creature; one evening ſeeing a good opportunity, I took up an axe, and with it I ſtruck Captain White overboard, and attempted to murder the paſſenger alſo; but
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018559_0007_0FA7B07A65FA2B00"/>
when I found I could not accompliſh my purpoſe ſurrendered myſelf a priſoner.</p>
            <p>I was confined for ſome time. Towards morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we fell in with a veſſel, which carried me into <hi>Plymouth</hi> as a priſoner, and remained for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time, which I ſpent in anguiſh, imploring mercy of God, for the crime I had committed. I was then ſent to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and condemned to die by my own confeſſion: And, agreeable to my inclination (chooſing rather to die than live.) Time would fail me to give a particular account of this affair; but this is the truth that I have ſet forth, which I declare as a dying man.</p>

In Auguſt one thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty two I happened to fall in company with a lad; he and I laid down to reſt.

I went to Col. Daverport and he gave me a paſs to <hi>New-London.</hi> I there entered on board a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateer commanded by Iſaac Warner. We went about eight days cruiſe, and by diſtreſs of weather got diſmaſted: Our veſſel being a wreck, and enable to defend ourſelves, we were taken by a Britiſh veſſel and carried to <hi>Burmudas.</hi> I then engaged with the Captain who took me priſoner, to go to ſea with him. I took twenty dollars bounty. I never went on board after I received the money and clothes, but rode off on my ten toes and left them.</p>
            <p>I went about ſeven miles to a piece called <hi>Cole-Lane,</hi> and engaged to go on board a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateer, took twenty-four dollars from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and then bid them good night. I next went to <hi>St. George's;</hi> there I entered on board another privateer, Captain Hall commander, and took twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four dollars bounty, we went five weeks cruiſe and then returned to <hi>Burmudas.</hi> Being deſtitute of every thing, I endeavoured to help myſelf to that which Solomon ſays will anſwer all things; and knowing that one Gutherege kept a ſtore there, I

took a partner with me and broke it open, where we found a barrel of dollars; we took our pockets and hats full, then went to a place called Salt Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and changed the ſilver for gold.</p>
            <p>Three weeks after this I entered on board Captpunc; Vezey, bound to <hi>St. Thomas's:</hi>—Peace being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, I went to <hi>North Carloina.</hi> I went from thence to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> where I went to work three weeks: then I and my partner broke open a ſtore in the day time, and took out twenty-four half-joes and ſome ſilver; my comrade was taken up on ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion and carried before a Juſtice, but made his eſcape; and as I was not ſuſpected, was ſent to catch him; I followed on until I overtook him, and he and I contrived the matter between us, that he gave me his ſhoes and buckels to carry and tell the injured people that I purſued him ſo cloſe that he was obliged to drop his ſhoes and buckels, and for this piece of villainy they rewarded (what they falſely called) my fidelity with two dollars.</p>
            <p>I then went to <hi>Baltimore</hi> and entered myſelf on board a pilot boat, a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> went to <hi>Philadelphia:</hi> I then entered myſelf on board a tranſport bound to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> I ſuſpected there was money on board, nor was my ſuſpicion groundleſs, for I and one more found a cheſt, and breaking it open, took out 40 pounds, then made our eſcape to <hi>New-York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after this I got a new comrade, and we broke open a ſhop, and took out the value of 100 pounds in money and watches. I then went to <hi>Newbury-Port,</hi> where I entered on board Capt Wheelwright, bound to the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> When I arrived there, I went into a trader's ſhop and took to the value of 40 pounds in goods. Soon after this

I took another comrade, and walking out we met: a man in the road: We told him we wanted ſome money and ſome we would have; he gave us three crowns. I then returned to <hi>Boſton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On Friday night before Commencement, Barrick and I went to <hi>Roxbury</hi> with an intent to rob any perſon, but we were diſappointed. The next Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night we went upon the old errand, but no booty. Soon after this we went to <hi>Winter's-Hill,</hi> and there we fell in with one Mr. Baldwin, and robbed him of his watch and money. I took the watch out of Mr. Baldwin's pocket, but Poor (the fellow who turned States Evidence) was the man that abuſed and gave him heavy blows. For this laſt crime I am to ſuffer death.—Theſe are the moſt capital crimes I have committed, and I ſincerely wiſh that others may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the rocks on which I have ſplit.</p>
