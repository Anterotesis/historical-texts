            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE riſe, progreſs, and improvements in anatomy, is an enquiry ſo highly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, and eſſentially requiſite for every ſtudent in the ſcience, that the following hiſtory, collected from different authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, will, I preſume, ſufficiently recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend itſelf to the anatomiſt, philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, phyſician, and every perſon who eſteems ſcientific purſuits deſerving a part of their applications.</p>
            <p>Young ſtudents too frequently labor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der innumerable difficulties in their appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to poſſeſs the works of the moſt valuable writers.—To attempt to ſelect theſe from thoſe of leſs eſtimation, would be a taſk which would not only require the moſt extenſive reading, but the moſt judicious diſcernment.</p>
            <p>However, I preſume to offer an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of authors and profeſſors in the periods in which they lived and flouriſhed, together with their diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and improvements, and eulogiums, as given by the moſt celebrated modern profeſſors.</p>

            <head>THE Hiſtory of Anatomy.</head>
            <p>THE firſt medical man known to have written on Anatomy was Hippocrates, though before his time there is great reaſon to believe that this ſubject was in ſome degree underſtood. From the natural horror which attends medling with human dead bodies, it is probable that the firſt enquiries were made on the brute creation.</p>
            <p>The deſcriptions of parts, given by early anatomiſts, evidently ſhew this; and when the anatomiſt had conquered his own prejudices he ſtill would have the prejudices of the people to encounter, which in moſt countries have been ſo great as to endanger the life of him who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts it; this muſt neceſſarily impede the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the ſcience.</p>
            <p>The firſt knowledge on this ſubject was probably derived from the religious ceremony of performing ſacrifices: in this ceremony particular parts were ſeperated for particular purpoſes, by which the ſacrificer muſt have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſome knowledge of the interior parts of animals.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:035232_0004_10017F275327EA58"/>
The ſuperſtitious maxim of prognoſticating events by the appearances of the viſcera, would contribute further to the acquiſition of this knowledge.</p>
            <p>The method of the Egyptians of embalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bodies, as mentioned by Joſephus, muſt have cauſed the embalmers to have acquired ſome knowledge of the human ſubject.</p>
            <p>Some paſſages in HOMER, who lived one thouſand years before Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſerve to ſhew he had ſome knowledge of this ſubject.</p>
            <p>Some philoſophers, about the time of Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates, appear to have been very much em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in enquiring into the ſtructure of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals as a part of natural Philoſophy; of theſe Democrates was particularly eminent. This philoſopher lived at Abdera, four hundred and ſeventy years before Chriſt, AEtatis 109. He was ſuppoſed by his countrymen to be mad, who deſired Hippocrates to viſit him that he might be cured.</p>
            <p>When Hippocrates firſt ſaw him, he was diſſecting an animal to di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> over the ſeat of the bile, and from the converſation which paſſed between them, Hippocrates pronounced him to be the wiſeſt man living.</p>
            <p>Hippocrates appears to have been the firſt who ſeperated medicine from philoſophy, and made the practice of it a diſtinct profeſſion. He has pai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>d out to poſterity the moſt certain means of practiſing the art ſucceſsfully, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:035232_0005_10017F2989DBBE20"/>
a knowledge of the ſtructure, ſituation, and alſo the uſe of the various parts which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the human body. The hiſtory which he has written proves him to be a man of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary accuracy in his obſervations. His works have been juſtly admired in all ages, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to many of his enthuſiaſtic admirers, they contain all the medical knowledge that has been ſince publiſhed. They alſo aſſert that the circulation of the blood, and other diſcoveries claimed by different anatomiſts, are to be found in his works—If, however, we impartially ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine his opinions on the functions of parts, it muſt be acknowledged, that he was very er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, and that his anatomical deſcriptions are very defective. To judge the better of this, I will afford a conciſe view of his opinions on ſeveral parts, viz.—</p>
            <p>First—That the heart was the origin of the blood and phlegm.</p>
            <p>Secondly.—That the urine came from the ſpleen, and the bile from the liver.</p>
            <p>Thirdly.—That the liver was the origin and root of the veins, as the heart is of the arteries.</p>
            <p>Fourthly.—That the veins conveyed the blood to the different parts of the body, which motion he compares to the ebbing and flowing of the ſea.</p>
            <p>Fifthly.—That the arteries were the reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs of the ſpirit, or air, and conformable to this idea he ſpeaks of the trachea as an artery,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035232_0006_10017F2BC5F43B20"/>
and accordingly called it <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> a name it ſtill retains.</p>
            <p>He applies continually the name of vein to the arteries, and alſo to the nerves and ureters: the nerves, tendons and ligaments are ſpoken of as being the ſame. He ſuppoſes the brain to be entirely glandular, and that it imbibed, like a ſponge, the ſuperfluous water from the heart. He ſays that the brain is the ſeat of prudence and of judgment: the ſpinal marrow, he obſerves, is continued from the brain, and that the term is improperly employed, as it is ſurrounded with membranes which the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in other bones is not. He ſays that the inteſtines are of a ſpongy texture where they touch the urinal bladder, through which the urine paſſes from the one to the other.—He obſerves that the kidneys ought to be claſſed with the glands, that they have an attracting power of imbibing a part of the fluids which are drank, and that it is filtered into water, and paſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from theſe into the bladder by veins:—he conceived the ureters to be veins, and from obſerving that they paſſed ſo directly into the bladder, he might ſuppoſe that they performed this office. In this works very little is ſaid on the muſcles, as he ſuppoſed that motion and ſenſation were performed by the arteries.</p>
            <p>It is doubted by many whether he ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected a human ſubject. <hi>Haller</hi> ſuppoſed that he had, from the deſcription he has given of the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035232_0007_100164CD35AF1290"/>
ſubclavius muſcle; but this evidence is not alone ſufficiently convincing as that muſcle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts in the ape, an animal which was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſected at that time.</p>
            <p>Hippocrates alſo tells us, as a great and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous event, "he once in his life had the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſeeing a human ſkeleton."</p>
            <p>This great man is ſaid to have been a deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of AEſculapius, he was born in the iſland of Cos, four hundred and ſixty years before Chriſt, and died at ninety years of age, but according to ſome, he lived to be one hundred and four.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plato</hi> followed the example of Pythagoras and Democrates, in teaching natural philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, by treating of ſeveral parts of medicine, particularly the oeconomy of the human body, but on this ſubject his opinions are very erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.</p>
            <p>He was born at Athens, four hundred and twenty nine years before Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> preceptor of Alexander the Great, wrote a natural hiſtory of animals, which, (as Pliny relates) conſiſted of fifty books, there being now only eleven extant. From the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy in that part of his works which remain, it is very evident he never had diſſected the human ſubject.</p>
            <p>He thought that the ſkulls of men were join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by three sutures, and thoſe of women by one only: he counts eight ribs on each ſide. Galen ſays he firſt named the aorta. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the nerves aroſe from the heart,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035232_0008_10017F2EA3A8AD68"/>
and that the heart was compoſed of three cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, containing three kinds of blood. He was born three hundred and eighty-four years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diocles,</hi> a phyſician of great reputation, who flouriſhed about one hundred and thirty years after Hippocrates, is ſaid by Galen to have written a book of anatomy, in which the order of diſſection is deſcribed for the purpoſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating the different parts of the body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Praxagoras</hi> of Cos, whoſe works are alſo loſt, is mentioned by Galen as an excellent anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt. He firſt diſtinguiſhed the arteries from the veins, which he deſcribes as being the beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing veſſels, and containing only air or ſpirit; he ſuppoſed that the arteries changed into nerves from the diminution of their cavities towards their extremities.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Alexandrian School,</hi> during the reigns of the Ptolemies who ſucceeded Alexander the Great, we find the ſtudy of anatomy flouriſhed in Egypt. The ſecond king of this name found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an academy at Alexandria, in which there was a library ſaid to contain two hundred thouſand volumes. Some aſſert a number equal to double the above. In this ſchool anatomy was particularly encouraged, all the executed criminals being ſent there for diſſection.</p>
            <p>From the time of Hippocrates to the found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this ſchool, which was more than two hundred years, phyſicians had made very little
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035232_0009_10017F3030C13B50"/>
progreſs in anatomy, and it ſeems very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that little, if any enquiry had been made, into the ſtructure of the human body, and the brute creation was alone diſſected.</p>
            <p>Galen has given an account of the Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian anatomiſts, two of which more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly deſerve our attention, viz. <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> and <hi>Herophilus.</hi>—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> diſcovered the lacteals in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentary of a goat; he explained the principal uſe of the brain and nerves, and divided the nerves into two kinds, one for the purpoſe of ſenſation, and the other motion, and obſerves that both kinds aroſe from the brain. He alſo deſcribes the ventricles of the brain; he was not aware that the arteries and veins carried the ſame fluid, but ſuppoſed that when the lungs were diſtended with air, it paſſed from the branches of the bronchia into thoſe of the heart, by which means he ſuppoſed the arteries were filled with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herophilus</hi> was contemporary with Eraſiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus in the Alexandrian ſchool. He diſcovered the fourth ſinus of the brain which ſtill retains his name; he firſt named the plexus choroides, the tunica arachnoides, the retina and duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, he compared the fourth ventricle of the brain in figure to a pen, and called it calamus ſcriptorius.</p>
            <p>Ammiames Marcellinus, who lived about ſix hundred and fifty years after the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035232_0010_10017F3265C553A8"/>
of the Alexandrian academy, tells us, "They were ſo famous in his time, that it was ſufficient to ſecure credit to any phyſician if he could ſay he had ſtudied at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It does not appear that anatomy was culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated among the Romans before the Chriſtian aera; for though <hi>Celſus,</hi> in his excellent works, <hi>"de Medica,"</hi> conſiders anatomy as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of medical knowledge. and uſually gives a ſhort, though generally correct, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the parts before he deſcribes their diſeaſes, yet it appears that theſe deſcriptions were almoſt entirely taken from the great phyſicians, and there are ſcarcely any improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be met with till near two hundred years after the birth of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ruffus</hi> wrote a work about one hundred and twelve years after Chriſt, in which he deſcribes the recurrent nerves, and obſerves, that if preſſure be made on the carotid arteries, the perſon will loſe his voice from theſe nerves being compreſſed being ſituated on the ſides of theſe veſſels; he alſo deſcribes the fallopean tubes, which were parts not known to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding anatomiſts.</p>
               <p>We now arrive at a period when a very ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate work was publiſhed at Rome by Galen, who is ſaid to have been born at Pergamus,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035232_0011_10017F3426E91AF8"/>
about the year one hundred thirty and one, and flouriſhed about one hundred and ſeventy.</p>
               <p>It is worthy of remark, this celebrated phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician and philoſopher, though a very great admirer and accurate obſerver of nature, lived to nearly the meridian of life an atheiſt, till one day alone in ſearch of natural productions, he found a human ſkeleton, which lay expoſed on the way ſide—the ſingularity of the event drew his attention, and in examining the wonderful machiniſm of his own frame, he was well aſſured it was of too curious and beautiful a formation to be the production of chance, and that none but a power infinitely ſuperior to man could produce ſo ſtrangely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable a phenomenon; he was inſtantaneouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converted to the belief of a Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and fell upon his knees and burſt forth in loud acclamations and praiſe—<q>My Lord and my God! nothing but a Being Infinitely great as thou art, could ever form ſuch a creature as man is,</q> or to this effect.</p>
               <p>His works contain all the learning of the foregoing ages, more eſpecially of the Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrian ſchool, where he ſtudied. They are alſo enriched with deſcriptions drawn from diſſections of the organs of animals, which are frequently compared with thoſe of the human body, and in ſome inſtances has thrown light on the functions of organs by real ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, particularly on the motion of the

blood and the importance of the pulſe. Theſe works, therefore, are ſtudied with entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if not with inſtruction—however, in general, it muſt be admitted that his opinions were hypotheſis, but they were ſo plauſibly connected into a ſyſtem, that he was implicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed for fourteen centuries.

               <p>Dr. Motherby, in his Medical Dictionary, has ſaid, "The medicine of Galen had much affinity with that of Hippocrates, with this difference, that Hippocrates's depends on facts o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <head>THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ALEXANDRIAN SCHOOL.</head>
               <p>In thu ſixth century Alexandria was taken by the Saracens, and the academy, which had ſubſiſted near one thouſand years, was entirely diſperſed, and its celebrated library, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitory of the learning of the eaſtern parts of the world, was almoſt conſumed. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when the Saracens were quietly ſettled in their conqueſts, they began to examine the remains of the Greek and Roman writers, and by degrees tranſlated them into their own language, and added the hiſtory of ſome new diſeaſes, as the ſmall-pox and meaſles, with ſome new remedies, the produce of their own country.</p>
               <p>In anatomy they made no improvements; for according to the tracts of their religion, a perſon after touching a dead body was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed unclean.</p>
               <p>From the ſuperſtition which at this time overwhelmed Europe, all the ſciences appear to have been at a ſtand, until the eleventh century, when academies began to be built in Europe, the arabians carrying their knowledge into the weſtern parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:035232_0016_10017F3D951EC0E8"/>
Academies and univerſities were inſtituted in Italy, and at Montpelier, in France.</p>
               <p>For ſeveral years, however, the profeſſors of anatomy contented themſelves with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting on the writings of the Arabians; ſo that, from the time of Galen (which was near one thouſand years) the ſtudy of anatomy, ſo far from making any improvements, had been gradually loſing ground; for the writings of the Greeks and Romans had been almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and the original improvements entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglected, while the writings of the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians, which were very imperfect, had been ſubſtituted in their ſtead.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the fourteenth century an original work was written by Mundinus, in the year 1315, and although his deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were extremely ſuperficial and inaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, his books were ſo highly eſteemed, that by the order of the ſenate of Venice, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors at <hi>Padua</hi> were obliged to teach that only which occaſioned a great number of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon it. This law was obſerved for two hundred years</p>
               <p>In 1440 the art of printing was diſcovered, and nearly about the ſame time Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the ſeat of the empire, was taken by the Turks; in conſequence of which learning was revived, and diffuſed over Europe by the learned men, who fled from the ſlavery of the Turks, and carried the original writings

of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> along with them into the weſtern parts.</p>
               <p>The number of books now increaſed very conſiderably, and before the end of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury ſeveral tolerable books of anatomy were publiſhed.</p>
               <p>In the following century, the ſpirit of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement was continued.

               <p>
                  <hi>Andreas Veſſalius</hi> was born at Bruſſels, 1514, and is ſaid to have ſhewn a very early genius for anatomy; and after the advantage of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying in different univerſities, he was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed profeſſor of anatomy at <hi>Padua,</hi> in the twenty-third year of his age. He firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his compendium of anatomy when on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly twenty five years of age, and afterwards his great work, in which he clearly deſcribes the various organs of the body, and teaches

his readers to follow him, by diſſection, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining his deſcriptions by tablets, which are at preſent admired by painters as well as ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts. which ſee in two large folio volumes, written in Latin.</p>
               <p>This genius raiſed him above a ſervile at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the antients: he has taken his deſcriptions from nature, and pointed out the errors of Hippocrates and Galen.</p>
               <p>At the end of his work there are many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments on living animals, in order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the uſe of organs, which merit par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attention, and none more than thoſe on the blood veſſels, which, when conſidered, it appears ſurpriſing that he miſſed the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the circulation of the blood. He made a ligature on an artery, and obſerved that it pulſated on the ſide next the heart on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; he then cut the artery through, and joined the two extremities with a pipe, when the diſtant portion of artery pulſated, though not when there was no communication. This experiment proved that their pulſation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on their being diſtended, which is an opinion diametrically oppoſite to that of <hi>Galen;</hi> he proves that the arteries naturally contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed blood, by making two ligatures, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the piece; he ſays there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication through the ſeptem from one ſide to the other of the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:035232_0019_10017F41F0D4CB20"/>
By opening the cheſt, he obſerved that the heart ceaſed to act, and that the lungs were motionleſs, by inflating the lungs with a pipe in the trachiae, that the heart again perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its actions; notwithſtanding theſe experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he ſtill adhered to the old hypotheſis.</p>
               <p>This great merit drew upon him the envy of his cotemporaries, who did not fail to load him with calumny; but having truth on his ſide, they were at length led to imitate him.</p>
               <p>This great reputation cauſed the Emperor Charles the fifth, to make him his phyſician, by whom he was greatly eſtemed, and which fixed him at court.</p>
               <p>Veſſalius's good fortune now met with a very ſudden reverſe; he having obtained per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to examine the body of a Spaniſh gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, whom he had attended as phyſician, it was obſerved where he opened the cheſt, the heart palpitated.

This ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere tribunal were going to puniſh his crime, when Philip the ſecond, of Spain, found means to intercede in his favor, and he was ordered to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.</p>
               <p>Soon after this, Fallopius died, and he was recalled by the ſenate of Venice, to ſucceed him as profeſſor of anatomy at Padua; but
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035232_0020_100164D206E18150"/>

               <p>Columbus, Fallopius, Euſtachius and Spigelius, improved, in many parts, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of Veſſalius</p>
               <p>Of all Veſſalius's pupils, there is none which merits our attention ſo much as Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtachius who has very accurately deſcribed the ſtructure of many parts which before had not been well underſtood The deſcription he has given of the kidneys has ſcarcely receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any addition by ſucceeding anatomiſts; he has alſo explained their functions by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and given a maſterly account of their diſeaſes—he made ſeveral diſcoveries on the organs of earing—he was the firſt who named the vena azagos, and has alſo clearly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the thoraſic duct, its ſituation and courſe, in a horſe; but from his having ſuppoſed it to be a vein, the diſcovery is not generally given to him.</p>
               <p>He compoſed a ſyſtem of tablets, which lay hid for more than a century, not being brought to light till the year 1712, and which are at this day admired for their elegance and accuracy.</p>

The great outlines of the body, and its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious organs, were now well underſtood and deſcribed, but the oeconomy remained very myſterious.</p>
               <p>Learning became now diffuſed from Italy to the northern parts of Europe, and a ſyſtem was publiſhed at Paris by Riolan, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for many years the common ſtandard of anatomy.</p>

The following extract from Hall's Ency<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clopaedia. on the late improvements of ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, and on the choice of anatomical au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, I preſume may alſo tend further to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the ſtudies of anatomical purſuits.</p>
               <p>The anatomiſts of this century have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved anatomy, and made the ſtudy of it much more eaſy, by giving us more correct as well as more numerous figures. We have had four large folio books of figures of the bones, viz. Cheſelden's, Albinus's, Sue's and Trew's—Of the muſcles we have had two, one from Cowper, which is elegant, and one from Albinus, which, from the accuracy and labor of the work, we may ſuppoſe will never be outdone. Of the blood veſſels we have a large folio from Dr. Haller. We have had one upon the nerves by Dr. Meckel, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other by Dr. Monro, junior. We have had Albinus's, Roederer's, Jenty's and Dr. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's works, upon the gravid uterus; Weit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brecht and Leber on the joints and freſh bones; Soemerring on the brain; Zinn on the eye; Cotunnius, Meckel, junior, &amp;c. on the ear; Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>er on the nerves of the thorax and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen; Dr. Monro on burſae mucoſoe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It would be endleſs to mention the anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical figures which have been publiſhed in this century, of particular and ſmaller parts of the body, by <hi>Morgagni, Ruyſch, Valſalva,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035232_0026_10017F5933531578"/>
Sanctorini, Heiſter, Vater, Cant, Zimmerman, Walterus,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>Thoſe elegant plates on the brain, however, juſt publiſhed by M. Vicq d'Azyr, muſt not paſs without notice, eſpecially as they form part of an univerſal hiſtory of anatomy and phyſiology, both human and comparative, propoſed to be publiſhed in the ſame ſplendid ſtyle; upon the brain alone nineteen folio plates are employed, of which ſeveral are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, The figures are delineated with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy and clearneſs; but the colouring is rather beautiful than correct. Such parts of this work as may be publiſhed, cannot fail to be equally acceptable to the anatomiſt and the philoſopher; but the entire deſign is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently too extenſive to be accompliſhed within the period of a ſingle life.</p>

has alſo obliged the world with an excellent ſyſtem of anatomy, and another work, under the title of "Elements of Anatomy, and the animal oeconomy," in which the ſubjects are treated with uncommon elegance and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity.</p>
               <p>In the latter part of laſt century, anatomy made two great ſteps, by the invention of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, and the method of what we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call "preparations." Theſe two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern arts have rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly been of infinite uſe to anatomy, and beſides have introduced an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance to our adminiſtrations which in former times could not have been ſuppoſed to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
               <p>They aroſe in Holland under Swammerdam and Ruyſch, and afterwards in England un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Cowper, St. Andre, and others, where they have been greatly improved.</p>
               <p>The anatomiſts of former ages had no other knowledge of the blood veſſels than what they were able to collect from laborious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections, and from examining the ſmaller branches of them upon ſome lucky occaſion, when they were found more than commonly diſtended with red blood. But filling the vaſcular ſyſtem with a bright coloured wax, enables us to trace the large veſſels with great eaſe, renders the ſmaller much more conſcpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, and makes thouſands of the very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute ones viſible, which from their delicacy
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035232_0028_10017F61F859C418"/>
and the tranſparency of the natural contents, are otherwiſe imperceptable.</p>
               <p>The modern art of corroding the fleſhy parts with a menſtruum, and leaving the moulded wax entire, is ſo exceedingly uſeful, and at the ſame time ſo ornamental, that it does great honor to the ingenious inventor, Dr Nicholls.</p>
               <p>The wax work art of the moderns might deſerve notice in any hiſtory of anatomy, if the maſters in that way had not been ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in their imitations. Many of the wax figures are ſo tawdry, with a ſhow of unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural colours, and ſo very incorrect in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of figure, ſituation, and the like, that though they ſtrike a vulgar eye with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, they muſt appear ridiculous to an anatomiſt. But thoſe figures which are caſt in wax, plaſter or lead, from the real ſubject, and which of late years have been frequently made here, are of courſe very correct in all the principal parts, and may be conſidered as no inſignificant acquiſition to modern anatomy.</p>
               <p>The proper or principal uſe of this art is to preſerve a perfect likeneſs of ſuch ſubjects as we can but ſeldom meet with, or cannot well preſerve in a natural ſtate—a ſubject in preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, for example.</p>
               <p>The modern improved method of preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing animal bodies, or parts of them, has been of the greateſt ſervich to anatomy, eſpecially
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035232_0029_10017F6505F04768"/>
in ſaving the time and labor of the anatomiſt in the nicer diſſections of the ſmall parts of the body; for now whatever he has prepared with care, he can preſerve, and the object is ready to be ſeen at any time; and in the ſame manner he can preſerve anatomical curioſities of every kind ſuch parts as are uncommonly formed, parts that are diſeaſed, the parts of the pregnant uterus and its contents. Large collections of ſuch curioſities, which modern anatomiſts are ſtriving almoſt every where to procure, are of infinite ſervice to the art, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the hands of teachers, to give clear ideas of many parts which it is eſſential to know, and yet which it is impoſſible that a teacher ſhould be able to ſhow otherwiſe, were he ever ſo well ſupplied with f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
