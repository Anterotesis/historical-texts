         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and took possession of it; The Scope of this Book then, is particularly, to display and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate, Gods Exact Faithfulness, in fulfiling all that he had Promised to his People; As to their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Entrance <hi>into,</hi> and Residence <hi>in,</hi> the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> after their Toilsome, Troublesome, and Tedious March, through the Wilderness, and Conflict with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Enemies, and Oppositions: All which is surely, A representation of the Deliverance of Sinners, from the bondage of Sin, their being outed of all self Sufficiency, and Excellency; in their Wilderness state, of Spiritual Distress; And their entrance <hi>into,</hi> and residence <hi>in,</hi> the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> of Complacency in, and Peace with God: All this being under the Powerful Conduct, of the Blessed <hi>Jesus,</hi> of whom this <hi>Joshua,</hi> was in these things a lively, Tipe and Figure; As he was also in his Name, which is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the same Hebrew word (<hi>JASHANG</hi>) which signifies to save or make safe, and is so interpreted Respecting the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World; <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 21.</p>
            <p>This Twenty fourth <hi>Chapter</hi> Contains, the Declaration of those things, which <hi>Joshua</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, in a way of <hi>Historical Recitation,</hi> and in a way of <hi>Vehement Exhortation,</hi> to the People immediately before his Death.</p>
            <p>Particularly, In it we have (First) <hi>Joshua's Oration</hi> or <hi>Sermon,</hi> in which he Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000644_0012_0FA9616F8A623FB8"/>
the many Mercies they had been parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of, in their coming forth out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and since that unto this day. And this he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, as a Cogent Argument, that they should <hi>wholly,</hi> and <hi>Onely</hi> give up themselves to the <hi>Service</hi> of the Lord, with all truth and sincerity of heart. This from the 1<hi>st.</hi> to the 16. <hi>Verse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, We have account, of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal of Covenant</hi> betwixt God and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or a new Obligation of the People, to the Obedience of the Law; in a Solemn manner, <hi>Verse</hi> 16. to the 29.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We have account of the <hi>Death of Joshua</hi> and <hi>Eleazar</hi> the High Priest; <hi>Ver.</hi> 29. to the end of the Chapter and of the Book.</p>
            <p>In this 15. <hi>v.</hi> we may note Briefly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Explicitely</hi> Propounded, A seeming <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to</hi> them, upon <hi>Supposition</hi> of an Evil Inclination <hi>in</hi> them, to depart from the Lord, to Idolatry and Superstition. <hi>And if it seem Evil unto you, to serve the Lord, Chuse you this day whom ye will serve &amp;c.</hi> Yet in this manner of speaking, there is <hi>Implicitely</hi> contained, a serious warning and solemn Dehortation, against their turning aside, from following the Lord, to the worship and service of false Gods: He desires them to the Plain, Clear, and above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, whom they would Chuse to serve, and worship, whether the God who had done such
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000644_0013_0FA961704C9B99A0"/>
great things for them, or other Gods on this side, or on the other side of the flood, <hi>whether the Gods which your Fathers served &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We have his <hi>Personal,</hi> and <hi>Pious</hi> Resolution, Exhibited to them, for their <hi>Example,</hi> and as a Testimony of his own <hi>Uprightness,—But as for me and my house we will serve the Lord.</hi> Here then we may Note. (1.) The <hi>Person</hi> Engaging, and that is <hi>Joshua</hi> for himself and those under his special Charge, he doth engage <hi>for</hi> them and <hi>with</hi> them; <hi>As for Me and my house &amp;c.</hi> (2.) The <hi>Duty</hi> He Engageth unto the performance of, and that is to <hi>Serve the Lord.</hi> (3.)We have here <hi>A free</hi> and voluntary, and yet <hi>firme</hi> and stedfast <hi>Resolution,</hi> with full Consent of the <hi>Will</hi> engaged for performance thereof? <hi>We Will serve the Lord.</hi> In a word, It is an <hi>Explicite</hi> Declaration, of an <hi>inward,</hi> Pious, Resolution. Now Scripture Examples, are for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and the practice of this Eminent Person, thus Presented <hi>unto us,</hi> ought to be imitated <hi>by Us,</hi> and layes Obligation <hi>upon Us,</hi> to do according thereunto.</p>
            <p>So that the DOCTRINE is, <hi>That it is the special Duty and Peculiar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, of all Religious Housholders, to bind themselves and all under their Charge; by a Firm, Solemn, and Explicite Resolution, to serve the Lord.</hi>

In Opening this Doctrine we may Inquire (1.)How it Appears, that <hi>Joshua</hi> speaks this as an <hi>Housholder</hi> or Master of a Family, (2.)What we are to Understand here by <hi>Serving</hi> the Lord (3.)What Influence a <hi>Solemn</hi> and <hi>

                  </gap>cite Resolution</hi> hath, upon the Vigorous Excercise of Religion in a Family, (4.)Why it is the <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> of a Religious Housholder thus to Resolve and Practice. And so we may Proceed to the Application.</p>
            <p>Quest. 1. <hi>How doth it Appear, that</hi> Joshua <hi>speaks this as an Housholder or Master of a Family?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Answer. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>(BETH)</hi> here rendred <hi>House,</hi> is sometimes taken liter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and properly, for a dwelling House or material building, in which Persons do dwell and inhabit; so it is used, Gen. 19.4. <hi>--They beset the House round,(i.e.)</hi> the dwelling place of <hi>Lot,</hi> and his Family. This House <hi>cannot</hi> serve the Lord. But besides this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> the word <hi>House</hi> hath many <hi>Figurative</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptations in Scripture, I shall mention onely such as tend to clear up the matter now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; sometimes then, it is a Comprehensive Term including a <hi>whole People,</hi> Nation, or Kingdom; Thus the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> are
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000644_0015_0FA96171DD5FA358"/>
called <hi>The House of Israel,</hi> Ezek. 3.1,4,7. <hi>A Rebellious House;</hi> Chap. 2. 5.</p>
            <p>Again, Sometimes it is put for a particular <hi>Tribe,</hi> Thus the Tribe of <hi>Benjemin</hi> is called, <hi>The whole House of Benjamin,</hi> 2 Sam. 3.19. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is taken yet more strictly, for a Particular <hi>Stock</hi> or Linage, Those of the same <hi>Race,</hi> Descending from the same Ancestors; Thus it is said I Sam. 25.3.—<hi>He was of the House of</hi> Caleb, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of his stock or linage. But yet more directly to our present purpose, It is put for all that dwell together in a Family, Collectively considered; and for the several persons there, sustaining several Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, of Superiours, Inferiors, and Equals; Thus Gen. 7. 1. <hi>Come thou and all thy House into the Ark &amp;c.</hi> For the <hi>Salvation of this House, Noah</hi> is said to be greatly concerned; <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7. Here in special a mans Children and natural Posterity are his House; <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. 11.—<hi>That their Houses shall continue for ever &amp;c.(i. e.)</hi> that their Children and Posterity, shall be multiplyed upon the Earth from time to time, and their Race and Linage not be cut off: Of this Houshold and Family, every Master hath a Particular care, and Charge, committed unto him by the Blessed God, the neglect whereof is a great Sin and Shame; as we read 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. Such a neglecter <hi>hath denyed the Faith and is worse than an Infidel.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:000644_0016_0FA96172E2964368"/>
Now <hi>Joshua</hi> was the Chief Captain, Leader, and Ruler of the whole Nation or House of <hi>Israel,</hi> as he was the successour of <hi>Moses;</hi> Hence he had inclusively the Charge of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Particular Tribe, especially his own Tribe; There (more strictly) he had peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his proper Race and Linage, those of his Kindred on whom he had influence by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as well as Office; And in short his own Houshold and Family, were to be the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate objects, of his daily care and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; He therefore in our Text gives us his Resolution to Serve and Honour God, in and with his Family; by his holy Dictates and Examples: Declaring though other Tribes, Families, and Housholds, should forsake the Lord; Yet He and his Family would serve Him, with all their heart.</p>
            <p>Quest. 2. <hi>What are we to Understand by Serving the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Answer. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word (<hi>GNA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BHAD</hi>) here used, is very Comprehensive, and is variously interpreted; being put for the Service of <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> and of the <hi>Earth;</hi> That which we are concerned about, it the Service of the LORD: Hence more generally, it is oftentimes put for all Religion; <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Thout shalt Fear the Lord thy God and Serve
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000644_0017_0FA9617349ACDA38"/>
Him onely.</hi> Thus it Comprehends in it, all kind of Religious Duties, which are to be attended, in a well Ordered and Holy Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, here in the world. For this <hi>Serving</hi> the Lord is enjoyned with <hi>Fearing</hi> of Him; <hi>I Sam:</hi> 12. 24. <hi>Onely Fear the Lord and Serve Him &amp;c.</hi> Fearing the Lord implies a <hi>Gracious</hi> Principle in the Soul, serving of Him denotes the <hi>Exercise</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> manifested by a Cheerfull and Diligent attending unto all Duties which are to be performed: But of those many acceptations of this word (<hi>Serve</hi>) in Scripture, there are principally <hi>Three</hi> which do afford us Light, to the understanding the matter now before us; (1.) It is put for <hi>Worship;</hi> and so read by the Apostle, Hebr. 12. 28.—<hi>To Serve Him acceptably, with reverence and Godly fear. (i. e.)</hi> To Worship Him. (2.) It is put for <hi>Subjection</hi> to his Soveraignty; Psal. 2. 11. <hi>Serve the Lord with fear &amp;c.</hi> The words following clear it, to imply Subjection. <hi>Verse.</hi> 12. <hi>Kiss the Son, least he be Angry, and we perish in the way</hi> That is, with a Kiss of <hi>Subjection</hi> to his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; (3.) It is put for <hi>Obedience,</hi> to his will and Command; so the Three Children, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>The God whom we Serve (i. e.)</hi> Whom we devote our selves to <hi>Obey;</hi> both in doing His will, and Suffering His Pleasure; Thus the Apostle Explaines <hi>Service</hi> by <hi>Obedience; Rom.</hi> 6.16. <hi>His Servants ye are to whom ye Obey &amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:000644_0018_0FA961760D85FD88"/>
These things are implyed in <hi>Serving</hi> the Lord; As therefore the Expression referres to the Constant, and Conscientious performance, of all Religious Family Duties: I reserve the handling of them, to the Application as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging to Practical Godlyness. And Proceed to the Third thing, to be inquired into, for Opening the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Quest. 3. <hi>What influence an</hi> Explicite Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, <hi>hath upon the Vigorous Excercise of Religion in a Family?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This will be cleared up in Considering these things.</p>
            <p>First. An Explicite Resolution denotes a <hi>Particular Choice</hi> Of, <hi>and Determination of the mind</hi> About, <hi>the thing concerning which the</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution <hi>is made.</hi> Man is a cause by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, of his own Acts; He is a Rational A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and while he is debating in his own mind, Comparing one thing with another, and Endeavouring to satisfy his Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is most Eligible, and Advantagious; This or that: His mind hangs in suspense, and is like the <hi>beam</hi> of the <hi>ballances</hi> on an <hi>even poize.</hi> But when Judgment pitcheth on one thing as an Object, much to be preferred to the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000644_0019_0FA9617717E4C2A0"/>
other, the Choice is made; the Scale is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and a firm Resolution puts the matter out of Doubt; and makes appear to every one, the man accounts That, the most <hi>Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and <hi>Excellent</hi> Object, utterly contemning whatsoever stands any way in Competition therewith. Thus <hi>Joshua,</hi> in our Text and Context, declareth his fixed Resolution, and unalterable fixation, by an acquiescing of his Soul on God, and devoting himself to His Service, as the most suitable and adoequate Object of Choice; rejecting and contemning all other Gods;—<hi>Chuse you this day whom you will Serve</hi>—But <hi>As for me and my House we will Serve the Lord;</hi> Now the firmness of this Resolution, it grounded on the <hi>Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> of the Properties of this Act of Choos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. (1.) It is a <hi>Free Act</hi> being the very Elicite Act of the will; hence where there is not an absolute freedom of will in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject chusing, there cannot be a choice made, of <hi>This</hi> more than of another object. (2.) It is a <hi>Deliberate Act;</hi> When the judgment is called in, to cast the Scale and deterimne the matter; Thus <hi>Joshua</hi> here signifies, he had weighed the matter in the ballance of sound judgment, and found that the Service of the LORD, out weighed all other Service whatsoever. (3.) It is <hi>an Act that puts Respect, Preference, and Preheminence, upon the thing chosen;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000644_0020_0FA96177CC4D17F8"/>
above all other things;</hi> So here in the Text, (<hi>q. d.</hi>) <hi>Chuse you whom you will,</hi> to Serve and Worship, whom you will value and Esteem, as the supreme Object, of Divine Honour and Adoration; for my part, I am fully satisfied, there is none like unto the LORD the God of Heaven, <hi>Neither is there any</hi> other god <hi>to be Compared with Him;</hi> Isa. 46. 50.</p>
            <p>Secondly. An Explicite Resolution, <hi>layes a Person under special Awe of GOD, in the things concerning which the Resolution is made.</hi> These Resolutions are Covenant Transactions with God, and Obligations of Soul to Him. Now to transact with the Infinitely Holy GOD, in a way of Covenant, is a very Awful thing; Yea it cannot be done, without the greatest care imaginable, to comply with out Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Thus <hi>Joshua</hi> Endeavours to possess the minds and Souls of the People, with the Solemnity of their binding themselves by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to Serve the Lord; and Him onely, as in the 19. <hi>Verse</hi> of this Chap, <hi>Ye cannot Serve the Lord your God, for He is an Holy God, He is a Jealous God, He will not forgive your Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and your Sin &amp;c. (i. e.)</hi> Ye Cannot, unless you are Resolved in your minds, by the help of His Grace, to cleave close to Him, with all sincerity of heart, so: if you are deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in <hi>Making,</hi> or negligent in <hi>Keeping,</hi> your
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000644_0021_0FA961788A9D4900"/>
Covenant with God; He will <hi>Return and do you Hurt, after that He hath done you Good;</hi> Verse. 20. So Solemn is the Obligation of an <hi>Explicite Resolution,</hi> in this great Duty of <hi>Serving</hi> the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. An Explicite Resolution, <hi>will in its own</hi> Nature, <hi>produce those Effects, which may prevent a Persons neglecting or delaying, the things about which he is Resolved.</hi> This Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <hi>Jephtha</hi> used, to his Daughter; <hi>Jud.</hi> 11. 35. <hi>I have opened my mouth to the Lord, and I cannot go back.</hi> He had not onely thought in his heart, but spoken with his mouth, and thereby <hi>Explicitely</hi> engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the matter; This made <hi>David,</hi> take special care of performing his Vows; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause; <hi>His Lips had uttered them, and his Mouth had spoken, when he was in distress. Psal.</hi> 66. 14.</p>
            <p>Particularly; these Effects are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Diligent Attending unto these means,</hi> which tend directly to promote, that unto which a person is resolved. Such a Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a <hi>General</hi> Obligation, under which all <hi>Particular</hi> Duties, are comprehended.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Stedfast Withstanding, and careful Avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whatsoever might hinder our Complying with
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000644_0022_0FA9617948CDFF70"/>
our Resolution.</hi> So soon as any Person comes up to a firme Resolution, in a matter of such importance, there are many Enemies and Oppositions step into the way to hinder their Compliance with it, and if Possible to make them break and violate it. I shall mention three.</p>
            <p>First. <hi>Satan;</hi> He Endeavours, all he can to divert us <hi>From,</hi> or interrupt us <hi>In,</hi> our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; But a resolved Soul Answers the Temptation, with Detestation, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan,</hi> I am Resolved to Serve the Lord, and will not (Divine Grace Assisting) be diverted, from my stedfast Obedience to Him; or betrayed by any of thy <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Policy,</hi> to the Service of any false God whatsoever.</p>
            <p>Secondly. <hi>Corruption within;</hi> Such is the Property of that Corrupt Principle, that is in every one by nature, that so soon as any Check is given to its motions and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, immediately it swells, strives, and struggles; appears in its Colours, looks like it self, and becomes <hi>Exceeding Sin ul;</hi> Rom. 7. 8. Now Holy and <hi>Solemn</hi> Resolutions, and Covenants, are as Dammes to stop the Tide, and Obstruct the Course of Sin; And when firmely, and Regularly made, they cannot readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be over-born, no not by the Rapid torrent of Original Concupiscence: Because the Lord
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000644_0023_0FA9617A0D31AB98"/>
Himself will Assist unto the fulfilling of them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. <hi>Carnal and Sensual Objects;</hi> Or, <hi>Worldly things;</hi> are ready to ensnare and intangle us. The <hi>World</hi> is an Enemy to a Christians Holiness, and thence Opposeth all things tending thereunto: So that unless our Resolutions be well fixed, the Whisperings of this business; and Emergency of the other affair; will Obstruct the course of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Worldly things, will be as so many Snares and Traps, to intangle us, unless we can chase them away, with like <hi>Holy Zeal</hi> as the Psalmist did his <hi>wicked Enemies Psal.</hi> 119. 115. <hi>Depart from me ye Evil doers; for I</hi> Will <hi>keep the Commandments of my God. (i. e.)</hi> I will maintain my stedfastness of holy Resolution, and not let go my Integrity, so long as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I live.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and Lastly. Explicite Resolutions, <hi>have influence upon others, As <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> render those about us inexcuseable,</hi> who do not take Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by them, and Endeavour to Practice accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. This is implyed in this Text, <hi>Chuse you this day whom you will serve &amp;c. (q.d.)</hi> But if you do not choose to serve the Lord, be Assured I shall by my Practice Condemn you; and bear Testimony against you; for I am come to a point in the matter, <hi>I and my House &amp;c.</hi> Thus
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000644_0024_0FA9617AC97280B8"/>
               <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family, where God was Served, and his Worship Celebrated, <hi>Condemned the</hi> Old <hi>World,</hi> Heb. 11. 7. Thus <hi>Lot</hi> and his Family, <hi>Condemned</hi> Sodom, and Gomorrah; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 6,7. Yea a Particular <hi>Godly Family,</hi> in the midst of a Sinful, and Degenerous People, doth <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn their Neighbours;</hi> for not Serving the Lord. And the <hi>Master</hi> of a Family, who is Conscientious in his Duty; will <hi>Condemn</hi> all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Charge, if they do not joyn with him in serving the Lord, with full <hi>Purpose</hi> of heart, and <hi>Resolution</hi> of Soul.</p>
            <p>The REASONS of the Doctrine are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>REASON.</hi> I. Because <hi>Our Service doth in all Respects, and by special Right belong unto God.</hi> He hath a Soveraign Right unto Us, and Ours, and all that <hi>We</hi> and <hi>They</hi> have and are: And that on these accounts.</p>
            <p>First. <hi>He is our Creator by His Power.</hi> Thus we read; Gen: I. 26,27. <hi>God Created man &amp;c. (i.e.)</hi> the first man, and all mankind in him: Now he that made us; may by right of Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aingty, challeng all that we <hi>Have, Are,</hi> and <hi>Can do;</hi> for his Service and Glory. He hath given us being, and in the making of us, hath <hi>Power as the Potter over the clay,</hi> (Jer. 18. 6.) and therefore, may justly Require our
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000644_0025_0FA9617BB48D1C18"/>
utmost Service and Obedience, by this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, the Psalmist moveth Himself and others, to humble and Holy Adoration; Psal. 95. 6.—<hi>Let us Worship and fall down and Kneel before the Lord Our Maker.</hi> On this Account also; he Presseth the most Triumphant and Elevated Praises, to be Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the Lord; Psal.100.1,2,3. <hi>Know that the Lord He is God, He hath made us and not We our selves &amp;c.</hi> Now <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Praises,</hi> are duties of <hi>Natural Worship,</hi> which we owe unto God as our Creator, and are Constantly to be attended, in the Exercise of Religion in Families.</p>
            <p>Secondly. <hi>He is Our Preserver, by His Providence.</hi> As he did at first gives us our Beings, so he upholds us in our beings: Our Lives; Motions, and Actions, are continually Dependent upon His Influence; Acts. 17. 28. <hi>In Him we Live, and Move, and have our Being.</hi> Now this Providence is over us, in Two Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects. (1.) <hi>In Providing for us,</hi> all that is Necessary; to the maintaining both our Bodys, and Souls in Life. Hence we read, That He hath <hi>According to his Divine Power, given unto us, all things which pertain to Life and Godlyness;</hi> 2. Per. 1, 3. It is from this Liberal Hand of Divine Bounty, that Common Favours are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously dispensed, to Good and Bad; <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 45.

—<hi>Maketh His Sun to Rise, on the Evil and on the Good, and sendeth Rain, on the Just &amp; on the Unjust.</hi> Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> acknowledged, the Lord to have been his <hi>Feeder, all his Life long;</hi> Gen. 48. 15. (2.) <hi>In Protecting of us</hi> from Injuries. We are every Day, every Night, yea every Hour, exposed unto Various Dangers, and Casualties; Wrongs and Injuries; form which the Lord doth <hi>Preserve</hi> and <hi>Deliver</hi> us, He then, that is our Defender, may well chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge our Service at all times; Now it is the Lords Peculiar Property, to Defend us <hi>from ALL Evil; To Preserve our Goings out, and our Comings in from hence forth and for ever.</hi> Psal 121. 7,8. Hence without His Protection, we cannot be safe; <hi>Except the LORD Keep the City, the Watchman waketh in vain.</hi> Psal. 121.1. On this account, the People of God apply themselves to Him, under such Metaphors and Titles, as denote the greatest Security, Protection, and Defence; Thus <hi>David, I Love Thee O Lord my Strength, my Rock—Fortress, Deliverer,—Buckler, Horn of Salvation, and High Tower,</hi> Psal. 18. 1,2. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> A Suitable and Sufficient Defence, at all Times and on all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions; Hereby then are we strongly oblidg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to <hi>Love, Fear,</hi> and <hi>Serve</hi> Him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. <hi>He is our Rewarder;</hi> and There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may Challenge our Service. Thus He is
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000644_0027_0FA9617F21165258"/>
Propounded, in the Gospel as the Adaequate Object of our Faith; Heb. 11. 6. <hi>He that cometh unto God must Relieve that He is; and that He is a</hi> Rewarder <hi>of all them that Diligently seek Him;</hi> His Faithfulness, is engaged by His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, to Reward those that Serve Him. And the Apostle assures us, Heb. 6. 10. <hi>God is not Unrighteous, that He should Forget our Work and Labour of Love, &amp;c.</hi> Yea so Faithful is He that hath Promised, in this Respect, that even the <hi>Smallest Service,</hi> shall not pass unrewarded. As our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, hath Affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us. Matt. 10. 42. <hi>Whosoever shall give to Drink unto one of these Little ones, a Cup of cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; in the Name of a Disciple; Verily I say unto you, He shall in no wise loose his Reward.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the LORD is our <hi>Creator, Preserver,</hi> and <hi>Rewarder,</hi> our Service must needs of Right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>REASON. II.</hi> Because <hi>the Lord doth Expect, Command, and Require, Our Service, Worship, and Obedience.</hi> I need not insist long here. It is plain, that the Maine End and Design of God is; by all the Precepts of the Scriptures, to <hi>Oblige</hi> us; by the Precedents, To <hi>Encourage</hi> us; by the Promises To <hi>Allure</hi> us unto his Service; and by the Threatnings, To <hi>Deterre</hi> us from the neglect thereof. Thus the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Summs up the People's Duty, in two
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000644_0028_0FA96180B0F1D8A0"/>
Words; I Sam. 12.24. <hi>Onely Fear the Lord, and Serve Him in Truth; &amp;c. David</hi> also, Declares, it to be the Lord's <hi>Command,</hi> that we should <hi>Keep His Precepts Diligently.</hi> Psal. 119.4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>REASON. III.</hi> As it is the <hi>Duty,</hi> so it is the <hi>Property,</hi> of the Religious Housholder thus to do; Appears <hi>From the Tendency of Grace, in such as do themselves sincerely Serve the Lord.</hi> The Grace of God is of a Diffusive, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative Nature; Compared therefore by our Saviour to Leaven, <hi>a little</hi> whereof will <hi>Leaven the whole Lump,</hi> and Over-spread by is influence <hi>the three Measures of Meal,</hi> in which it is hidden; Matt.13.33. So <hi>So Grace</hi> will sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Sanctify the whole man, in <hi>Body, Soul,</hi> and <hi>Spirit:</hi> And having obtained Dominion over <hi>That Man,</hi> proceedeth to the <hi> Next, </hi> and Extendeth its Efficacy, to the Sanctification of <hi>Others,</hi> so far as may be. Hence the true Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Lord Jesus, are said to be <hi>the Salt of the Earth;</hi> Matt. 5. 13. <hi>Salt</hi> to prevent Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction; <hi>Salt</hi> to di<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>use a <hi>Savoury Relish</hi> to those with whom they Converse. Again Saints are <hi>Lights of the World;</hi> Matt. 5.14. <hi>Lights</hi> for their own Lustre, and Brightness of Holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation; As also to give Guidance and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, to others with whom they Converse. Thus the Religions Housholder, is willing to bring as many others as possible he can, to Serve the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000644_0029_0FA961822054DB00"/>
               <hi>LORD;</hi> Endeavouring to have his Family like that of the Devout Cornelius; <hi>Who Feared God with All his House, &amp;c.</hi> It is a special token of Sincerity, to Endeavour to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of our Capacity, the Good and Salvation of others: and to be grieved, when we cannot prevaile upon them; hence David, Psal. 119. 136. <hi>Rivers of waters run down mine eyes; Because men keep not thy Law.</hi> So if we would approve our selves, to have a Principle of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> in us, we should mourn over the Sins of others, which we cannot prevent. Thus shall we come to be Known, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Acknowledged, and Accepted of God, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was; Gen. 18. 19. <hi>For I Know him, that he will Command his Children and he Houshold, &amp;c.</hi> This will be matter of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to us now, and Rejoiceing in the Day of the Lord.</p>
            <p>For <hi>APPLICATION</hi> of this Doctrine to our selves.</p>
            <p>There are three Uses to be insisted upon <hi>(First)</hi> Of <hi>Exhortation</hi> and <hi>Direction;</hi> how it may be so with us in our Families. <hi>(Secondly)</hi> OF <hi>Lamentation,</hi> because it is not so. <hi>(Thirdly)</hi> Of <hi>Caution</hi> against these things, which do Oftentimes hinder it from being so.</p>

Incumbent on the Heads of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. Now those Relative Duties which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the several Persons in Families, are to be reduced to Three heads. (1.) The Duties of <hi>Superiours,</hi> to <hi>Inferiours.</hi> (2.) Of <hi>Inferiours,</hi> to <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours.</hi> (3.) Of <hi>Equals,</hi> one towards another. Those which we are now Concerned to Enquire into, are the Duties of Superiours to Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours; for the maintaining a Constant course of Religions Service to God in Families; which belongs unto Practical Godliness, and consists in daily Excercise of these things. The People are wont oftentimes to say unto the Preachers; The Life of <hi>Doctrine</hi> lyes in <hi>Application;</hi> surely the Preachers may as truly and Properly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer them, The Life of <hi>Application</hi> lyes in <hi>Practice.</hi> Especially in these Important Duties, of such Universal Concernment.</p>
                  <p>The Duties are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Reading the Scriptures, daily in the Family.</hi> A Duty too too much neglected (I fear) even amongst Professors. The Scriptures are the Words of the <hi>Eternal God;</hi> Containing the Words of <hi>Eternal Life;</hi> Written by men <hi>Inspired</hi> by the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> 2 Pet. 1. <hi>ult.</hi> Now <hi>What is written is written for our Learning; &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 15. 4. Therefore surely for our <hi>Reading,</hi> without which we are not Capable to Learn. It is Recorded in Commendation of <hi>Timothy</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15. <hi>That from a Child, thou hast Known the Holy Scriptures &amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="unknown:000644_0032_0FA96183CCAF2D58"/>
Surely the way to know them, so as to grow Wiser unto Salvation, is to Read them. Once more, It is Required of the King; Deut. 17.19. <hi>That he should Read in the Book of the Law, all the Dayes of his Life.</hi> If the King is to Read daily in the Book of the <hi>Law,</hi> then surely Professors of the Name of Christ ought to Read in the Books of the <hi>Gospel</hi> every day; As proper means, to prepare them <hi>For,</hi> and quicken them <hi>To,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Duties of <hi>Family-Worship.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Follow this with <hi>Family prayer,</hi> This is a Duty belonging to <hi>Natural Worship,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore binds all Persons, at all Times; As the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle Exhorteth, Eph. 6.18. <hi>Praying Alwayes, with All Prayer and Supplication, &amp;c.</hi> Of which <hi>Family Prayer</hi> is one kind, and is necessary, both for the <hi>Example,</hi> and <hi>Encouragment,</hi> of those that are under our charge. This is brought in, as a special evidence of <hi>Cornelius's</hi> Devoutness, in the <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> of the Lord, with all his House, <hi>He Prayed Alwayes,</hi> Act. 10. 2. Besides <hi>Prayer</hi> is a <hi>Necessary duty,</hi> Pertaining to a Christians Walk, when he walks like himself; Surely then <hi>David</hi> did not walk in his House or Family, with a Perfect heart, but that he Prayed for them and with them; as <hi>Psal.</hi> 101.2. There is indeed, a Praying for our Children and Servants, in <hi>Secret;</hi> which is the Duty of all sincere Christians: An earnest Plying the Throne of

Grace, As <hi>Abraham</hi> did, Gen. 17. 18. <hi>O that</hi> Ishmael <hi>might Love before Thee.</hi> So should we, particularly Recommend our Children to the Mercy of God, in our <hi>Secret Addresses</hi> every day; But that <hi>They</hi> may be <hi>Assured,</hi> that we pray <hi>For Them,</hi> and may also be <hi>Encouraged</hi> to do the like, if they shall Live to come into the same Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Family-Government, we ought Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously, to attend Family-Prayer <hi>With Them</hi> every day.

Otherwise we cannot Expect, to obtaine any Mercy at the Hand of God, for our Selves or Ours. The Apostle <hi>James</hi> informs us, That such a man as is <hi>Faint, Weak,</hi> Doubting, <hi>Cannot Expect to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing of the Lord;</hi> Jam. 1.6.

(2.) Let us Watch against <hi>Distractions in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Duties.</hi> Many Occasions will Intrude upon us, to Distract our minds, and abate the Intens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our Souls in these Duties. Let us do our Utmost, so to Order and Compose every <hi>Business,</hi> and to Govern every <hi>Person,</hi> in their several Capacities, that there may be no distraction but what is purely Accidental; but as much as possible we may <hi>Attend upon the Lord,</hi> in Family-Prayer <hi>Without Distraction;</hi> I Cor. 7.35. Remembring we are in the <hi>Presence of GOD,</hi> who cannot Endure to behold Iniquity; About things of <hi>Everlasting Concernment,</hi> that our Hearts and Souls, may be Engaged in the Duty; and we may do it with <hi>ALL</hi> our <hi>Might;</hi> Distractions in Duties are very Evil things, and we are never more in Danger to be <hi>Pestered</hi> with them, than in Family Prayer; Let us do by them as <hi>Abraham</hi> did by the <hi>Birds,</hi> that annoyed his <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> Gen 15. 11. Use our utmost Endeavour, by the Assistance of the Spirit of God, to <hi>Drive them away.</hi> Heartily grieving, for what we cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us Carefully Attend <hi>Catechising of Our Families.</hi> This is a Duty of Great Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the bringing Young ones, to a Sound and Methodical knowledge of God, Christ, and the Way of Salvation. Indeed the <hi>Word</hi> is not Expresly set down in Scripture, yet in

many places, we find the <hi>Thing</hi> intended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; Particularly, Gal.6.6. <hi>Let him that is Taught in the Word Communicate &amp;c.</hi> The Greek word <hi>(CATECHOUMENOS)</hi> there used, for <hi>Him that is Taught</hi> gives us the derivation of the Name, and the true Notion of the thing.

To the Dishonnour of God, and our Profession of Godlyness; Convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us by our own Wofull Experience, of the truth of what the <hi>Wise Man</hi> Asserts, Eccl.8.6. <hi>Because to Every Purpose, there is Time and Judgment: therefore the Misery of man is Great upon him (i. e.)</hi> because he hath not Understanding, to comply therewith.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>RULE. II. Be sure to Begin with Religion, Earth in the Morning.</hi> This will have a Special Influence, upon the Orderly management of All the Duties of the Day, both in our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Particular calling.

<pb n="36" facs="unknown:000644_0044_0FA9618F6197BF28"/>
the other Business <hi>Calls</hi> for Attendance, and the pretended Necessary delay of them, doth too often issue, in a <hi>Sinful</hi> and therefore <hi>Shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> Obstruction or Omission for that Day and Time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>RULE. III. Let all General Family Duties, be attended in such Seasonable manner, as that Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Person of Understanding, and Capacity to Profit, may Without Faile be Present at them.</hi> We ought not to let our Children or Servants, want a Meal for their Bodies; Oh! Let none of them Miss of a <hi>Chapter,</hi> a <hi>Prayer,</hi> An <hi>Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> or <hi>Counsel,</hi> for their Precious and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls. For if they do Perceive Us, not to be concerned, about their being Present at such Duties; they may well imagine, the Attending of them is of <hi>No Great Importance,</hi> and the Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of them is of <hi>No very Dangerous Consequence.</hi> And under those Pernicious Misapprehensions, may be ready to harden themselves in Sin, and to Persist in Careless and Sinful Neglect of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; so as to hazzard the Utter Ruin and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of their Souls for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>RULE. IV.</hi> And Lastly. <hi>Be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edious in Family-Duties.</hi> I Confess, this is an Error on the Right hand, yet it is an Error; which some Professors Do fall into: Now if we are Over-Tedious in Duties, it detracts from
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000644_0045_0FA9619018CFB710"/>
the Seasonableness of them, hence a Duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in good Time, may be Unseasonably Ended by the Length of it. <hi>God is in Heaven, and thou on Earth, therefore let thy Words be few, (i. e.) Humble, Sensible, Faithful,</hi> and <hi>Fervent;</hi> I would not be thought, to Diswade or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Pious Souls, from enlarging their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, when they want any <hi>Special Family-Mercies,</hi> and would Jointly Apply themselves to the Throne of Grace to obtain them: Or when they have received any <hi>Family-Blessings,</hi> and would Jointly return their Praises, and Thans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings for them; But it hath been observed, that the most <hi>Pious</hi> and <hi>Zealous</hi> Ministers; have not been long in Family Duties, no nor yet in Publick Prayer on Ordinary Occasions; giving this Reason, they were willing to Pray their Hearers Hearts <hi>Into Heaven</hi> (by a warmth of Holy Zeal and Fervency) but not by Tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to Pray them <hi>Out again.</hi> Besides the <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> are not many, and the Petitions in the Lords Prayer, that <hi>Most Excellent Platform,</hi> are but Six, besides the Preface and the Conclusion. Again the <hi>Spirit</hi> is never so willing as it ought to be; but when it is <hi>Most willing, the Flesh is Weak.</hi> Finally, God is not moved by a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Words, he needs not <hi>Information,</hi> but hath Commanded us onely to be his <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers,</hi> who hath graciously Commended, and Encouraged, Sincerity and Fervency; James 5.

The Miserable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of such Masters and Families, as do not Serve the Lord.</hi> They are the Objects of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Fury. The Inspired Penmen of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, have by the Holy Ghost; uttered direful Imprecations, That Divine Wrath might not onely be <hi>Dropped,</hi> but <hi>Poured down, upon those that Call not on the Name of the Lord (i.e.)</hi> Such as Live in the Total Neglect, of Family Worship and Religion; <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 25. A Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which do not Serve and Worship the Lord, is an <hi>Heathenish Family;</hi> And is therefore Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the Wrath and Curse, of the Infinite and Eternal God.

                  <p>
                     <hi>CONSIDER. III. If any of those that make the fairest Profession, can allow themselves in the Neglect or Slighty Performance of Family Duties, they have
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:000644_0056_0FA9619BDC19C190"/>
great Reason to question the Truth of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</hi> It is one thing to <hi>Fall</hi> Into, or to be <hi>Forced</hi> Unto, a Neglect of Duty; and another thing to <hi>Allow</hi> our selves in that Neglect. The best of all, may Casually be Interrupted or hindred, but it is their grief. To allow the Omission of Known Duty; or Commission of Known Sin; Shews that Person to be under the Power of some Lust, which layes a Wound at the very Root and Foundation, of their Profession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Now the most distinguishing signes; of a Sincere Profession, are taken from a Spiritual and Fervent Performance, of Private Duties; Hence a man is not to Judge of himself or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by the shew that he or they make, of Zeal and Devotion, in the Church, Town, or Company of Godly men: But by his or their Care, and Conscience; Zeal, and Fervency; in the <hi>Private, Secret,</hi> and most retired Duties, of Practical Godliness. It is oftentimes said, and that too truly, that Some men are <hi>Saints abroad, &amp; Devils at home.</hi> Amongst those that Countenance Religion, they can look as Demure, and speak as Fair as the best; but observe them at home, and they are guilty of many Sinful, and Shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Neglects, of Family Worship and Religion. Surely such may Justly fear, that God will one day Write upon their whole Profession. <hi>TEKEL thou are weighed in the ballance, and art found wanting.</hi>

Now a Natural Affection may move us to take care of the <hi>Bodies</hi> of our Children; Our own Worldly interest may Excite us to take care of the Bodies of our Servants, that they may Serve us the better; but it is onely a <hi>True Christian-Love</hi> that will Engage us to Concern our selves about their <hi>Souls.</hi> The <hi>Soul</hi> of man is the <hi>Better Part,</hi> and Love of that is the <hi>Best of Love.</hi> Hence those Duties of Religion which do in a special Manner tend to the good of <hi>SOULS</hi> are of the Highest concernment: For our Saviour Himself saith, <hi>What will it Profit a man, if he should Gain the whole World, and Loose his own SOUL: or What shall a man give in Exchange for his SOUL.</hi> Matt.16.26.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>CONSIDER. VII. A Family, which Live in the Total Neglect of Religious Duties, is a meer Nurse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Satan, and Cage of Unclean Birds.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there <hi>GOD</hi> is Dishonoured; His <hi>Name</hi> Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed; His <hi>Worship</hi> Neglected; and <hi>Sin</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, without Controule; Insomuch that <hi>SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAN</hi> hath <hi>Therein</hi> and <hi>Thereby Dominion</hi> over them; Hence those <hi>Spriggs,</hi> which are Transplanted out of such a <hi>Nursery;</hi> into the Orchard of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth, cannot bring forth any, but <hi>Sowre</hi> and Unsavoury fruit, which will be <hi>Rejected</hi> of

and <hi>Conscientiously;</hi> But since That Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is gone off the Stage, they have Finished their Course, <hi>Done their Work</hi> in their Day, according to the Will of God, and are <hi>Fal'n Asleep in Jesus;</hi> How justly may the Lord Upbraid us, As He did his People of Old; Jer.2.21. <hi>Yet I had Planted thee a Noble Vine, wholly a right seed, how then art thou turned into the Degenerate Plant, of a Strange Vine unto me.</hi> Hence then it may Sadly; and yet Too truly be said, that there is <hi>Risen</hi> and Riseing, <hi>Another Generation; which Know not the Lord; nor the Works which He hath Done.</hi> Now that ever there should be Families, yea <hi>Many</hi> Families in <hi>New-England;</hi> a Land of <hi>Light,</hi> and Famous for <hi>Religion;</hi> Yea and in the Chief Places there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which are without the Practice of Religious Duties in them; this is matter of Great Grief, to all Serious and Piour Observers; But Oh!

So as never to turn aside, by Occasional Omissions, or Perfunctory Performance of these Duties: Are there not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Children and Servants in Professors (yea and (Alas for us) in Church-Members) Families; of <hi>Twelve, Fourteen,</hi> or <hi>Sixteen, Years of Age,</hi> who (To my great Grief I have Observed) can Read <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> and Understand <hi>Less,</hi> of the Holy Scriptures: Are <hi>Strangers</hi> to Catechetical Instructions; And hence <hi>Are;</hi> and cannot but <hi>Be;</hi> most Shamefully, and Unaccountably Ignorant, of those Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Principles, of Christian-Religion, which are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensibly Necessary to be known, in order to the Salvation of their Immortal Souls. How justly then, may we fear, that the <hi>Controversy</hi> of the <hi>Great GOD,</hi> with the People of this Land, at This Time, in those many Afflictions that are upon us; Is for the <hi>Degeneracy</hi> of Professors, and the <hi>Unbecoming</hi> Carriage of those that are in Visible Covenant; For the <hi>Provoking of His Sons &amp; Daughters;</hi> and the Prophaneness, of Our <hi>Sons,</hi> and <hi>Daughters:</hi> Occasioned by too much Indulgence of Parents, and too Great Neglect of Family-Duty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction: In and by which they should from their <hi>Infancy,</hi> be devoted to God, and His Service in their Day and Generation.
