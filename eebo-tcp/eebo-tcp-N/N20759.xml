            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE occaſion on which the following Diſcourſe was delivered, ought not to be deemed too inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any farther notice. The opening of an <hi>African Church,</hi> in <hi>America;</hi> and, perhaps, <hi>the firſt,</hi> is a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able event in the progreſs of Chriſtian knowledge. At the requeſt, therefore, of the People expreſsly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and with the countenance of ſeveral moſt reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble characters, who wiſh well to them, the Author of this Diſcourſe, aſſents now to its proceeding from the preſs. It was prepared in unavoidable haſte, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch peculiar circumſtances of failure of health at the time, that it could not have been undertaken at all, or even tolerably executed, when undertaken, had it not been for <hi>Dr. Ruſh</hi>'s diſtinguiſhed attentions, and his moſt valuable hints, of which the Preacher was fortunate in availing himſelf.</p>
            <p>The familiarity of the <hi>Stile,</hi> and plainneſs in the <hi>manner</hi> of addreſs, it is to be preſumed, require no apology.</p>

            <p>O Lord, our heavenly Father, almighty and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God; Creator, Preſerver, and Governor of the Univerſe; regard, we beſeech thee, the prayers and praiſes we this day offer unto thy divine Majeſty, in the place which we are now aſſembled in, to dedicate unto thee. Dwell in this houſe, we pray thee; accept and ſanctify it, as an holy Temple, devoted to thy ſervice, and to the maintenance of thy true religion and virtue.</p>
            <p>We know, O Lord, that thou dwelleſt not in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples made with hands, ſo as to be circumſcribed by them, as thou haſt created the boundleſs expanſe of Heaven

Yet, though thy divine nature be thus unlimited, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe, we beſeech thee, to be more eſpecially preſent in this Sanctuary, by thy grace and heavenly benediction; that, as often as two or three are gathered together <hi>here</hi> in thy name, thou mayeſt be in the midſt of them, to hear and to fulfil their petitions: ſo that this houſe may be for ever ſacred to the worſhip of thee the only true God; where the Goſpel of thy bleſſed ſon, our ſaviour Jeſus Chriſt, may be faithfully preached, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his inſtitution rightly and duly adminiſtered—that Goſpel, which is "the power of God unto ſalvation to as many as believe"—thoſe holy Sacraments, which, being worthily received, are able to "nouriſh us unto eternal life."</p>
            <p>And do thou, O merciful God, who before all Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, prefereſt a pure and upright heart; enlighten, preſerve, convert us. "May thy Prieſts," <hi>here</hi> mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering before thee, "be clothed with righteouſneſs, and may thy Saints," uttering their reſponſes, "ſing with joyfulneſs."

May they ever poſſeſs a lively remembrance of the mercy thou haſt vouchſafed unto them, in being graciouſly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to call them out of the darkneſs of Paganiſm, and the bondage of ignorance and error, into the clear light of Goſpel Revelation, and "the glorious liberty of the children of God." May their underſtandings be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more illuminated by that heavenly light, and may they ever "ſtand faſt in that liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made them free." May they ſo diligently learn the precepts of thy bleſſed ſon, and ſo conſtantly follow his good example, that, having faithfully worſhipped thee in thy church upon earth, they may, when the preſent period of their probation ſhall be accompliſhed, be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the general aſſembly and church of the firſt-born

            <p>AS <hi>I paſſed by,</hi> ſoon after the walls of this Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were carried up,—<hi>and beheld</hi> the Marble on the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Front, <hi>inſcribed</hi> with theſe words, my attention was exceedingly attracted by them; for I was ſtruck with the propriety of ſuch a <hi>choice.</hi> And, I know of none more ſuitable to direct our thoughts on the preſent intereſting occaſion.

            </p>
            <p>The ſtile of holy Scripture is often figurative; and notices are taken from familiar objects, and circumſtances generally known, in common life, in order to convey ſpiritual conceptions with the greater clearneſs, and to render their impreſſion the ſtronger and more abiding. This is remarkably ſeen in the writings of the ſublime Iſaiah. We have an inſtance of it before us, in the Text,—where the words Darkneſs, and Light, which, literally, denote qualities univerſally underſtood, as they reſpect worldly things, are applied to certain qualities and conditions relative to ſpiritual things.</p>
            <p>—"The people that walked in Darkneſs"—is the Prophet's expreſſion;—"The people" who lived in
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027259_0008_0FD3F32E2739DEC0"/>
blindneſs and error, <hi>have ſeen a great light,</hi>—the light of the truth—the light of the glorious goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>With ſome variation, how ſtrongly is the ſame thought repreſented in the cloſe of the verſe—"they that dwell in the land of the ſhadow of death, upon them hath the light ſhined."—</p>
            <p>—Yes; of all darkneſs, that of the Soul is moſt dark: and of all who wander—the wanderers from the path of life, are moſt forlorn, and to be pitied.—Of courſe, Divine illumination, the light from God, is, of all things, the moſt precious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You</hi> are a people who have "walked in Darkneſs."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You</hi> who walked in darkneſs, have been favoured with a change of that condition; you have been brought <hi>to ſee Light</hi>: And</p>
            <p>That Light is a glorious one—a <hi>great</hi> Light.</p>
            <p>From theſe conſiderations, do clearly flow certain Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which eminently claim your obſervance.</p>

            <p n="1">1. In being brought up as Pagans, or Heathen, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Divine Revelation, and the covenant of grace, <hi>in your own country.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">This is meant of the <hi>general</hi> ſtate of the black people, or Africans.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Your fathers, and ſome, perhaps, of you now preſent, did, near the ſhores of <hi>Senegal</hi> and <hi>Gambia,</hi> on this or the other ill-fated range, or coaſt, of <hi>Africa,</hi>—may be in <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin, Congo</hi> or <hi>Angola,</hi>—ignorant of "God that made the world, and all things therein,"—bow down in adoration before ſtocks, ſtones, beaſts, and the vileſt creeping things,—pray to the hollow winds; or, dancing in wild circles, mutter to Devils;—or, in affrighted gaze, yell to the pale moon, to ſave you!—And it is known, that proportioned to the degrees of darkneſs, in the aforementioned reſpects,—eſpecially the "groſs dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs" covering the people,—muſt, of courſe, be the corrupt ſtate of their manners.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You have "walked in darkneſs," as being ſlaves in <hi>this country</hi>—for ſlavery, and darkneſs, or ignorance, go hand in hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:027259_0009_0FD3F32E2BB95430"/>Can a poor African, dragged in fetters from his native land,—and here, driven and tormented under the laſhes of cruelty, be any thing elſe than dark, dark! Can a people, kept back from knowledge, expreſsly for this reaſon—leſt it ſhould unfit them for being beaſts of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,—<hi>can they</hi> be any other than dark?</p>
            <p>To the credit of humanity, in <hi>this</hi> part of America, and ſeveral other parts, <hi>ſuch treatment</hi> hath been held in abhorrence. It is unknown, except in narratives from abroad.</p>
            <p>Still, at the very beſt, ſlavery is an hard allotment. It ſinks the mind, no leſs than the body: it weakens its ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity: deſtroys all <hi>principle</hi>; corrupts its feelings; prevents it from either diſcerning, or chooſing aright in any thing. Yes—and in the proportion that it exiſts any where, it has its effect in vitiating the general manners.</p>
            <p>PENNSYLVANIA!—thou haſt conſidered this: Thou haſt mitigated its ills, in the firſt inſtance, and in the moſt proper manner which the evil would admit of, art purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the plans for its entire abolition.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You "have walked in darkneſs," as <hi>ſinners.</hi> In this reſpect, all mankind are upon a footing—they all <hi>walk in darkneſs.</hi> The term is fitly choſen indeed, to expreſs <hi>the ſtate of man.</hi> He has loſt ſight of his chief end, and of the means to attain it. He miſtakes his ſupreme good. He wanders in crooked paths. He expoſes himſelf conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to dangers. He falls into innumerable vices and corruptions—and no wonder—for he walketh in darkneſs.</p>
            <p>This darkneſs may be conſidered in a two-fold view,—as <hi>external</hi> and <hi>internal.</hi> The <hi>external</hi> darkneſs includes that ſtate of things in the world, which is oppoſed to the knowledge of God, and true religion; thoſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſeverally, or taken together, which the <hi>evil one</hi> makes uſe of, as a medium, through which, to carry on his own foul buſineſs. It comprehends all thoſe erroneous ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems of religion which prevailed among the different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, before the appearing of the Meſſiah, Jeſus Chriſt; and all the ſchemes or ſyſtems, whatever may be their names, that have been ſubſtituted for his religion, ſince.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:027259_0010_0FD3F33049A34130"/>The <hi>internal</hi> darkneſs is ſeated in man's mind. It is an immoral diſpoſition of the heart; a corrupt ſtate of the affections. It is THE ENMITY AGAINST GOD, ſpoken of by St. Paul. It is that aching, wrathful abyſs (if I may ſo expreſs it) <hi>void and without form</hi>—till the ſpirit of God "moveth upon the face of it," and ſaith, "Let there be light."—</p>
            <p>The depraved condition of the ſoul, being the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effect of man's fall, you find ſet forth in holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by no expreſſion ſo frequent, as that of "Darkneſs." And, what is very obſervable—this internal darkneſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways implies that extreme evil, <hi>Unbelief</hi>—a diſtruſt in the Almighty, and his declarations: and, in relation to the redemption offered to the world—it is a refuſal to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thereof, or to comply with its gracious terms.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In the next place, let us obſerve, agreeably to our text, that a "People that walked in darkneſs," <hi>external,</hi> and <hi>internal,</hi> "have ſeen a great light."— They have perceived by the eye of their underſtanding—they have diſcovered—they have become acquainted with, that which will guide them to liberty and happineſs.</p>
            <p>By this "great light," is meant the knowledge of true religion—the inſtruction contained in the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt;—"the light of the glory of God in the face" of his beloved Son,—who is himſelf called "the light of men;" "the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world." Verily, under the circumſtances in which his world lay by reaſon of ſin; and, in the expectations of deliverance through the grace and virtue of a meſſenger ſent from GOD, who is <hi>the eternal eſſential light;</hi> there could not be a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per word ſummarily to characterize that divine meſſenger, than LIGHT. Well therefore, may the beautiful meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor be uſed, as it often is, to deſignate or expreſs <hi>his influence.</hi> This is called light, as oppoſed to darkneſs. It diſpels darkneſs. It irradiates the external and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal hemiſphere of the mind. It is that <hi>ſpiritual</hi> medium of ſight, by which we <hi>ſee</hi> ſpiritually. It ſhows God to be what he is. Our altars need no more to have this inſcription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. It reveals his name, his nature, his perfections.—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:027259_0011_0FD3F3321588C970"/>It ſhows man, as a creature, and a ſinner. It ſhows him in a very different view from what he is diſpoſed to conſider himſelf, by the light of his own reaſon. It diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers to him his littleneſs, his dependance on a ſuperior, his depravity,—and withal, his utter inability to ſave himſelf. Particularly, does it open <hi>the way of ſalvation;</hi> ſetting forth, in a manner moſt comfortable, moſt eaſy to be underſtood by people of all capacities—high, or low,—that "God may be juſt, and yet the juſtifier of him who believeth in Jeſus." It ſhows, that grace is the true ſpring of holineſs: that divine pardon produces divine peace; and this peace to be inſeparable from puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and virtue. It ſhows, moreover, all the ſocial and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative duties; and points out the connection of each of them with the glory of God, and with general and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual happineſs. Yes, my brethren,—and to complete the whole, it opens the divine abodes of exiſtence in the world to come. It carries your hopes ſtedfaſt and ſure, to the morning of that bright day, in the which, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ones ſhall put on immortality,—ſhall all meet one another, and meet the Lord;—when dignity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence that cannot now be uttered, ſhall be theirs for ever.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It is called a <hi>great</hi> light. Let us enquire into the reaſons of this epithet. It is <hi>great,</hi> both with reſpect to its <hi>object,</hi> its <hi>origin,</hi> and its <hi>circumſtances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Its object: Here indeed, there is not <hi>one</hi> only; but many: and in the like multiplied view, may the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin be contemplated, together with the other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>In regard to the firſt,—I ſhall try a moment to direct your attention to the principal of all—It is a <hi>great</hi> light, becauſe it manifeſts to the world, the <hi>Great Being.</hi> The knowledge of God, or the religious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of an intelligent, almighty <hi>Cauſe</hi> of all things,—"the rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him," is as <hi>eſſential</hi> to human happineſs, as the breath we draw, is now to human life. Man may exiſt without knowing God: but exiſtence merely is not happineſs. A ſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on our part, of the relation we ſtand in to the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great and good Creator, and of the duty flowing from that relation,—it is this that gives man his dignified
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:027259_0012_0FD3F3337A1CBD50"/>
place in the arrangement of the univerſe. Yet, it is too certain, to be diſputed, that ſuch knowledge or ſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might, through human degeneracy and weakneſs, in a great meaſure, or altogether become loſt.—It actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally did ſo—What was the ſtate of the world, in this reſpect, before the revelation of goſpel light? What hath been its ſtate ever ſince, in places where that light has not reached? or in minds which refuſe its friendly aid, under all the circumſtances that appreciate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it? One cannot give a more expreſs, and at the ſame time, a more full anſwer to the above, than in theſe few ſcriptural words, "Having no hope, and <hi>without God.</hi>"—</p>
            <p>The great light I am ſpeaking of, immediately tends to the removing from human minds, that obſcurity which covered them, with regard to that infinite Being. It is light that <hi>doth make manifeſt.</hi> And it is this <hi>great</hi> light that hath revealed or manifeſted God—not in <hi>the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of his nature;</hi> but, as far as by us, he may be known; a Being great and good,—in whom the moſt entire confidence may be repoſed; a Being who ordereth and governeth univerſally, and in the moſt perfect man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; a Being who is the ſtandard of excellence; and who is ſtill the compaſſionate benefactor of man though fallen; a Being who is reconciling the world unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; who is eſtabliſhing an intercourſe between earth and heaven; beſtowing forgiveneſs through a Mediator; and opening all the ſprings of righteouſneſs and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Here there ariſes in view</p>
            <p>Another object of this light, enhancing its exalted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and qualities; I mean the great ſalvation by the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt; a ſalvation from ſin and death, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to holineſs and life eternal: for, wherever its gracious influence is experienced—<hi>there</hi> peace is eſtabliſhed; the dominion of ſatan is overturned, and a new domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fixed in the ſoul—the reign of God; new principles are implanted—the principles of light and love; a new life communicated—the life of heaven.</p>
            <p>This ſketch muſt ſuffice at preſent—</p>
            <p>Other particulars, numerous and important, might here be brought forward, as <hi>objects</hi> of the <hi>great light</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us: but as the <hi>principal</hi> ones contemplated juſt now,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:027259_0013_0FD3F335534A85B8"/>
do virtually include or refer to all the reſt; I forthwith paſs on</p>
            <p n="2">2. To the greatneſs of this light, in reſpect of its <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> or <hi>ſources.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is <hi>great,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Becauſe it comes from the <hi>Great</hi> Being, "the Father of Lights," the Author and Creator of all things. He "who commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs," <hi>in the beginning,</hi>—hath now "ſhined into our hearts, to give us" this light.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Becauſe it was conveyed to the word, by the <hi>great</hi> Immanuel, the Son of God, "the brightneſs of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's glory, and the expreſs delineation of his perſon;" of whom it was predicted, that "he ſhould be great."— It was conveyed by him, whoſe immenſe dignity, and divine attributes, atteſted and announced in the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt manner, muſt give it value. It was conveyed by him, who was THE WORD, and in the beginning, "with God;" —"who hath a name above every name;" of whom it is ſaid, as "the firſt begotten," "and let all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God worſhip him;" and "thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever"—upon whoſe ſhoulder is "the government," as Mediator—the WONDERFUL,—the <hi>Counſellor,</hi> the <hi>Mighty God</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The Mighty Lord, or Heir of all things—Lord over all.</note>, the <hi>Everlaſting Father</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">The Father of the perpetual <hi>age to come,</hi> the age of the Goſpel.</note>, the <hi>Prince of Peace</hi>—"able and willing to ſave unto the uttermoſt:" I repeat it,—This light, this "Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is from above," conveyed by Him, muſt be <hi>great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) It is <hi>great,</hi> becauſe it is communicated by the agency of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> whoſe power is great to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all reſiſtances from earth and hell; whoſe office it is, to "reprove the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgment;"—the ſpirit who led the diſciple Peter, to make the memorable confeſſion which his Lord entitles THIS ROCK, "on which he will build his church,—and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it;"—the ſpirit,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:027259_0014_0FD3F3369728D540"/>
through whoſe divine irradiations, the ancient prophets, and all the men of God from the beginning, ſaw, and foretold the ſeveral periods of the Meſſiah's kingdom;— its dawn, its commencement, its gradual unfolding, and the unutterable glory in which it is to iſſue;—the Spirit, whoſe guidance and inſpiration were given in a manner ſtill more extraordinary, unto the Apoſtles—leading them unto all truth: bringing to their remembrance all that their Maſter had taught them; enduing them with miraculous powers; accompanying their preaching with irreſiſtible energy and demonſtration; inſtructing them how to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and refute their adverſaries; ſupporting them and their pious followers againſt the ſpirit and malice of the world; qualifying them ſeverally to fulfil the great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of the miniſtry; and abiding with all the faithful ſervants of Chriſt, miniſters and people, to the end of the world: the Spirit who is the author at firſt, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter ever afterwards, of all ſaving impreſſions, graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous influences, and heavenly virtues in the human mind; —the inſpirer of the gifts of faith, of purity, of love, of conſolation:—Through his agency and operation, is this <hi>light</hi> communicated.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſaid it is <hi>great,</hi> in relation to the circumſtances ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to it: and this is the third head, with which the conſideration of the greatneſs of this light, ſupplies me.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) It is <hi>great,</hi> becauſe it hath endured a great while —from the fall of man, to the preſent day. It is as old as the creation. With its early rays it comforted and refreſhed the patriarchs. Increaſing gradually, it was a guide to the prophets. From one age to another, down to the "fulneſs of the time," it taught the good and juſt, to "live by faith." It was reflected back in hope and conſolation, from every type and ordinance of the law. It encircled every altar. It interpreted every ſacrifice. It enabled the members of the church of God, to look through each emblem and ſhadow, to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. In a word,—it may be traced in a diſtinguiſhable ſtream, up to the beginning of time: it will extend down to the end of time; and it will ſhine more and more "un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the perfect day."</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) It is <hi>great,</hi> becauſe it ſhall illuminate the whole world. Yes, "from the riſing of the ſun, unto the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027259_0015_0FD3F33802377588"/>
down of the ſame," it will cauſe the name of the Meſſiah to be "great among the heathen." In a more eminent degree than we can have any juſt conception of, at preſent,</p>
            <p>"One tide of glory, one unclouded blaze"— ſhall cover the earth.—</p>
            <p>Innumerable paſſages of Scripture prove the future univerſal prevalence of this light: meanwhile, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt compariſons, and moſt expreſſive charming proſpects are made uſe of often, to repreſent its excellency and increaſing brightneſs.</p>
            <p>I refer you, particularly to the Book of Pſalms;— to the Prophets, Iſaiah, Zechariah, and Malachi;— to the books of the holy Goſpel, expreſsly ſo named;— to the epiſtles of St. Paul,—and the revelation of St. John: the ſubſtance of their report, is, That by the prevailing and expanding of this light, the "Dominion" of Chriſt, ſhall be from ſea, even to ſea; and from the rivers, even to the ends of the earth<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. 7<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note>: That every where, the walls of his church ſhall be called "ſalvation, and its gates praiſe<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſa. 60.</note>:" That "in every place, incenſe ſhall be offered to his name, and a pure offering<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mal 1.</note>:" That "the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and ſolitary places ſhall be univerſally made glad; and the deſerts ſhall bloſſom as the roſe<note n="§" place="bottom">Iſa. 35.1.</note>;—The mountains exult,—the vales be filled with melody;— the trees of every foreſt break forth into ſinging<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ch. 44.</note>:— the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf unſtopped<note n="¶" place="bottom">Ch. 29. Ch. 35.</note>:"—That "the fulneſs of the Gentiles ſhall come; for the ſame Lord over all, is rich unto all that call upon him<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 11.</note>;" That "the ranſomed of the Lord, ſhall return, and come to Zion with Songs, and everlaſting joy upon their heads<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſa. 3<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>;" That "a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude"—countleſs by men; "of all nations, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, and people, and tongues, ſhall ſtand before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palms in their hands<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev. 7.</note>."—</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:027259_0016_0FD3CDCFA0986410"/>(3.) Laſtly, it is <hi>great,</hi> becauſe, as it will ſhine on, with unceaſing luſtre, until the end of time; ſo it will ſhine hereafter, in the glory which it produces, throughout all eternity.</p>
            <p>From the words thus opened and explained, there clearly ariſe certain duties, which you are expreſsly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in. Allow me, with affectionate plainneſs to ſtate and recommend them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is, <hi>Gratitude to God,</hi> for having directed, in his own wiſe Providence, that you ſhould come from a land of Pagan darkneſs, to a land of Goſpel light; from a ſtate, afterwards, of ſlavery, to a ſtate of liberty; and now, from guilt and ſinfulneſs, to this ſtate of ſalvation, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe who brought you, or your fathers, from your own country,—one may ſay of them, with a little variation,—becauſe of the different circumſtances—as <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid to his brethren, "But as for you, ye thought evil againſt us; but God meant it unto good, to bring to paſs, as it is this day, to ſave much people alive."</p>
            <p>I am aware, that your condition, or caſes ſeverally, may differ a good deal, one from the other. I will ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify an inſtance, and conſider it with you, a moment; not loſing ſight of the gratitude juſt mentioned.—As the greater number of you are free; ſo, there may be others of you yet in bondage: theſe nevertheleſs, have received mercies enow to thank God for. His diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are unqueſtionably wiſe and proper. Whatever he permits, will turn to the real profit of ſuch as do reſign themſelves to his good pleaſure. Your preſent ſituation does not hinder you from being <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s freemen. Your preſent ſituation gives you ſome advantages above what others have: yes, and very poſſibly, above what your Maſters have,—in that your humbleneſs of mind, your patience, faithfulneſs, and truſt only in God, will add to the greatneſs of your future happineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next duty is <hi>gratitude</hi> to your <hi>earthly benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> who planned your emancipation from ſlavery.</p>
            <p>There are certain evils, which, when once they have obtained footing, and become <hi>epidemick,</hi> as it were, are ſcarcely ſeen as evils: no wonder then if they be ſlow and difficult to remove: ſo it hath been with ſlavery. A few humane, conſiderate perſons, at an early period of our
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:027259_0017_0FD3F33AF9C39900"/>
ſettlement in this country,—yes, in <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, were moved by the Divine Spirit, to open <hi>light</hi> upon this darkneſs. Their Teſtimony was treated as viſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for a while; but, in time, it gained upon the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſciences of men.</p>
            <p>Here, you will recollect the names of LAY, of WOOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAN,—and above all, ANTHONY BENEZET;—whoſe labours were unwearied in your behalf; whoſe works of benevolence and love, have followed them to the regions of peace and bleſſedneſs beyond the grave.</p>
            <p>There are alſo living characters not a few, in this city, and throughout the <hi>United States,</hi> heartily engaged in the ſame buſineſs of humanity. Behold, how intent they are to do your people good!</p>
            <p>You owe much likewiſe, to thoſe perſons who planned ſchools for the inſtruction of your children. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is as the <hi>door</hi> introducing the young people to the <hi>great light.</hi> Knowledge is the beſt foundation for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and uſefulneſs: and it is the element and life of <hi>Freedom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You owe much to the "Pennſylvania Society for promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the abolition of ſlavery, and the relief of free negroes unlawfully held in bondage." The memory of <hi>Franklin</hi> here riſes before you. He was its Preſident. With the like views in which it originated, may it perſevere— till its work be completed.</p>
            <p>But eſpecially, do you owe a large debt of gratitude to the citizens of Philadelphia, who aſſiſted you by dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and loans, in the building of this handſome, ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and very convenient church<note n="*" place="bottom">Dimenſions—60 feet, by 40—height proportional.</note>. You thought that to have an houſe of your own to aſſemble in for public worſhip, was, in conſideration of your increaſed num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, now deſirable and expedient. In the ſame view have your patrons and friends regarded the matter, and countenanced your proceedings. And, as with brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kindneſs and complacency, they leave it to yourſelves to fix upon, or adopt ſuch ſyſtem, order, and mode of worſhip as may be moſt agreeable to you; ſo have they found a perfect freedom in helping you to prepare a
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027259_0018_0FD3F33C8E019628"/>
place, where that ſyſtem, order, and mode may peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reſide, and operate.</p>
            <p>On the pleaſing ground marked out above, I <hi>could</hi> go farther,—indulging <hi>your</hi> feelings,—and <hi>my own,</hi> by particularly mentioning ſome characters in this place, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent for generous actions, wherever they have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; and who truly have been ſo, with regard to you:—But we are reſtrained in that ſatisfaction. There is, however, what will be infinitely more acceptable to them; namely, to ſee that their acts of kindneſs <hi>do good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moſt favourably aſſiſted, the pious labour of your hands hath proſpered thus far; and you are now happily aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, for the firſt time, within theſe walls;—<hi>we</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our congratulations; and cheerfully uniting with <hi>you</hi> to worſhip the God of All.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another duty, is compaſſionate love to your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who are yet in darkneſs, or bondage, in other parts of the world. Be tenderly affectioned towards their condition. Pray publicly, and privately, that "the Lord may hear your voice, and look upon their affliction, and their labour, and their oppreſſion."—</p>
            <p>O mighty God! Thou doſt encourage us in this thing. For, notwithſtanding the confuſion of nations, and the corruption and madneſs of human paſſions;—there is ſome proſpect that the general cauſe of juſtice and of freedom, and of peace on earth, will at laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail!</p>
            <p n="4">4. Humility is the next duty.—Remember your former condition. Pride was not made for man, in any, even the higheſt ſtations in life; much leſs for perſons who have juſt emerged from the loweſt. It is ſaid, there is a great deal of this among your people, already; and that it is increaſing extremely faſt. I wiſh this might be no more than a ſurmiſe: and then, that even the ſurmiſe itſelf might be dropped; for your friends meet with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements on this head. Will you, my brethren, guard againſt pride? Will you reflect on the nature of the evil itſelf; the offences that come by it; and other unhappy conſequences!</p>
            <p>It was a cuſtom among the Jews, as you find recorded by Moſes, in the book of Deuteronomy, ch. 26.5—when the Prieſt received the <hi>Baſket of firſt fruits</hi> from them;—
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:027259_0019_0FD3F340454503A8"/>
for each perſon to declare, in the houſe and preſence of the Lord,—the hiſtory of the mean and wretched ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of his family: "A <hi>Syrian</hi> ready to periſh, was my father."</p>
            <p>In like manner, when you are tempted to cheriſh the leaſt pride, in your freedom—in dreſs—in your favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reception among your fellow-citizens,—and even in this <hi>ſtately building;</hi>—or in any of your civil, as well as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious privileges;—then check yourſelves, by confeſſing privately and publicly, that "a ſlave ready to periſh was my father:" Or, if all cannot ſay this; you may unite in expreſſions ſtill more humbling, and ſay "A ſinner—a fallen man—a rebel againſt God—an heir of wrath; and, until redeemed, a child of hell, <hi>was my father.</hi>"</p>
            <p n="5">5. Circumſpection in your conduct and intercourſe with the world, is another duty that you are eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in. "See that ye walk circumſpectly; not as fools, but as wife." Remember, that you have enemies, as well as friends; that you will be narrowly watched; and that leſs allowance will be made for your failings, than for thoſe of other people. This circumſpection will be the more neceſſary, as you have became a religious ſociety.—</p>
            <p>Peaceableneſs among yourſelves, and with all men, is indiſpenſable to a fair character; as alſo truth in your dealings, in your words, and in your inner man; diligence in providing things honeſt: temperance and ſobriety; an obliging, friendly, meek converſation.—</p>
            <p>Here a particular thought occurs to me, which is not to be ſuppreſſed: With regard to thoſe of you who are <hi>not free,</hi>—you muſt not be caſt down, nor diſcontented. It is a diſpenſation of Providence, as I hinted already, to which you ſhould ſubmit in quietneſs, for conſcience ſake: and in ſo doing, you ſhall certainly meet with good. I give you St. Paul's advice, adapted exactly to your ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "Let as many ſervants as are under the yoke, count their own maſters worthy of all honour; that the name of God, and his doctrine be not blaſphemed<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. vi.1.</note>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:027259_0020_0FD3F34163815718"/>To proceed: You have built an houſe for the public worſhip of God; and this day, ſolemnly dedicated it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.—</p>
            <p>O may the Lord our God accept of the dedication! Let him not leave this people, nor forſake them: "Hear thou in heaven, their prayers and their ſupplications, and maintain their cauſe!"</p>
            <p>Come then ye people, highly favoured! Your houſe is <hi>Holineſs unto the Lord!</hi> Let none who ever worſhip in it, diſhonor it at any time, or in any way. You have here, in the moſt public manner named the name of Chriſt, and told us, You "have ſeen his ſtar in the eaſt, and are come to worſhip him;"—depart then,—depart from all—yea, even from the ſhadow of iniquity.</p>
            <p>It is not a ſmall matter, to have even heard of the true God. It is ſtill a greater to have been taught his pure religion: But, together with the above,—for <hi>you</hi> to be encouraged, in the courſe of events, to build a temple to that God, wherein his name may be adored,—this is indeed <hi>an honour</hi> beſtowed upon you. Here then, be aſſured,—is a period in your progreſs and profeſſion, which will prove very remarkable: For, according as your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct henceforth, turns out well or ill; your example will be a praiſe in the view of all around you,—or a reproach. Yes, this very houſe—or rather, the converſation of thoſe belonging to it, "is ſet for the fall, or riſing again of many"—of the people <hi>of your colour.</hi> On the right improvement of your preſent advantages, depends, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the fate of your brethren in bondage, in every part of the world. Strengthen the hands of your friends every where by your pure and unexceptionable conduct. This will be to "let your light ſhine," in favour of the multitudes yet covered with darkneſs. This will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the deliverance of thoſe who are bound.</p>
            <p>A contrary behaviour will certainly increaſe their dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and tend only to rivet ſtill cloſer their chains. It may render the yet exiſting reproach of our country per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual.</p>
            <p>To conclude;—Strive to eſcape from the darkneſs of ſin. O let it not be "your condemnation, that light is come into the world, and that you have choſen dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than light, becauſe your deeds are evil."
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:027259_0021_0FD3F34343C6B878"/>
With your own eyes, behold the <hi>great light</hi> that has been deſcribed; and walk ye in it. Prize beyond all things the inſtructive, renovating grace of the goſpel. Reflect on the conſiderations now offered for that purpoſe. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, I beſeech you, to the admonitions of your own conſciences; to the calls of Providence; to the word of the Lord; to the teachings of the Divine Spirit; to the terrors of neglecting ſo great a ſalvation; to the hopes, and the joys of obtaining it;—to the ſure proſpects of glory, honour, and immortality in the life to come.</p>
            <p>Thus have we aſked, O great God! for the counſel, and light, and Bleſſing which we need. Thus have we opened theſe doors, for thy ſacred worſhip, and to thine honour. Thus, with thy permiſſion, have I ſpoken to this people, whom we take by the hand as <hi>Brethren</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus.—Who can doubt, but thou wilt, look down from Heaven, and caſt upon us the bright beams of thy mercy!</p>
            <p>MY RESPECTED AUDIENCE,</p>
            <p>What if now, before we part, ſome free-will offering ſhould be made, in favour of this dedicated houſe— Prayers never come up more acceptably before God, for a memorial, than when united with alms: And I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe, that there are very few occaſions, if any, on which ſuch an union could, with more propriety than the preſent, take place.</p>
            <p>Under ſome difficulties, though highly favoured,— after conſiderable delay, and apprehenſions, at times, of much greater;—it hath pleaſed Providence to permit this goodly building to be brought on to its preſent ſtate. There is more muſt be done to it yet, you ſee, ere it will be quite ſafe and convenient to aſſemble in: and very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, notwithſtanding the economy of the managers or truſtees, a ſhare of the paſt account, is yet unpaid.</p>
            <p>The people of the congregation may by eaſy contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from time to time, help themſelves in this laudable buſineſs. Yes: and it may be reaſonably expected, that each of you now preſent,—I ſpeak to thoſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation—will, this day, give ſomething for that purpoſe. And, for your encouragement, theſe reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:027259_0022_0FD3F344C72548E0"/>
citizens, a number of your benefactors,—your Fellow-Chriſtians alſo—will cheerfully go on to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and aſſiſt you.</p>
            <p>Will <hi>you</hi> then—(I addreſs myſelf to ſuch benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) will you allow me to ſolicit a preſent contribution, in the generous view intimated above! and then—we ſhall depart with ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>To preſs this matter much, is totally unneceſſary: For, it has ever appeared to me a trait in the <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi> character, that the citizens looked not for <hi>preſſing ſolicitations</hi> to do beneficent actions; but for <hi>opportunities.</hi> "And God is not unrighteous, that he will forget your works, and labour that proceedeth of love."</p>
