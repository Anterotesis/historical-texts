            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>"IF there is joy in the preſence of the angels of GOD, over one ſinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine juſt perſons, who need no repentance;"—and "if the SON of MAN came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance," certainly it is the incumbent duty of thoſe to whom he hath committed the "DOC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRINE of remiſſion of ſins," and "recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to GOD," not only to "go through the cities and villages," preaching PEACE by JESUS CHRIST;" but alſo, to "vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit the priſon-houſe," even the dungeon, and to communicate the "glad tidings of ſalvation" to thoſe "who ſit under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death."</p>
            <p>To turn ſuch "as are faſt bound in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and iron, from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto GOD, that they may have a portion among thoſe who are ſanctified through the blood of Jeſus, is the deſign of the following manual, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the morning and evening, and other holy offices of the church.</p>
            <p>Though there is in the hands of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, a great variety of devotional tracts, yet
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:023776_0003_0FC1239C7570B1D0"/>few or none of them (ſo far as the author knows) are profeſſedly written for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate victims of juſtice: therefore, to render the matter and the manner of the following devotions, unexceptionable in the eyes of Chriſtians, and promotive of faith and repentance in convicts, they are written after the manner of the antient liturgies; and the matter is principally ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the word of GOD.</p>
            <p>N. B. As the following devotions are moſt likely to fall into the hands of the benevolent and humane, "who weep with thoſe that weep, and mourn with thoſe that mourn;" the author has to requeſt their candor for any inaccuracies they may diſcover, either in the compoſition or printing, as they were carried directly from the pen to the preſs; in order that, with all poſſible expedition, they might be put into the hands of <hi>James Williams</hi> and <hi>Thomas Mount,</hi> now lying under ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death in the gaol of Newport.</p>

                  <p>Ye who are dead to the law, and under the ſentence of condemnation, liſten to the voice of your gracious and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate GOD calling you to repentance, in order that ye may find mercy in the day of judgment. Humble yourſelves under the mighty hand of GOD—If ye do ſincerely repent, confeſs and forſake your ſins, <hi>"tho' they were as ſcarlet, they ſhall be made white as ſnow; tho' your wickedneſſes have gone over your heads, they ſhall not be your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction!"</hi> Therefore—Be afflicted—mourn, and weep,—humble yourſelves in the ſight of GOD. Turn unto the Lord, with all your heart, with faſting, with weeping, and with mourning. For, the ſacrifices of GOD are a broken ſpirit—a
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:023776_0004_0FC1239DA72BD118"/>broken and a contrite heart, O GOD, thou wilt not deſpiſe. He that covereth his ſins ſhall not proſper; but whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh them ſhall find mercy. Ye ſhall remember your ways, and all your doings wherein ye have been defiled; and ye ſhall loathe yourſelves in your own ſight, for all your evils that ye have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. If ye confeſs your ſins, GOD is faithful and juſt to forgive you your ſins, and to cleanſe you from all unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Caſt away from you all your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions <hi>(by confeſſing them freely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve)</hi> and turn yourſelves from all your tranſgreſſions <hi>(by ſincere repentance)</hi> ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruin. "<hi>The</hi> LAW <hi>is made for the lawleſs and diſobedient.

But, O Lord, thou art my Father; I am the clay, and thou the potter—I am the work of thy hands—thy bleſſed and adorable Son died for me a violent death: O may the purifying ſtream of his blood flow upon me, to cleanſe me from my guilty ſtains!

Juſtly haſt thou delivered me over to the tormentors, that I ſhould pay the forfeiture of my life! and therefore, O my GOD! horror taketh hold of me,—my bowels are turned within me!—O that my head were waters, and mine eyes fountains of tears, that I might weep day and night, to waſh away the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of my guilty ſoul and body!

                  <p>Our GOD is a conſuming fire: clouds and darkneſs are round about him, juſtice and judgment are the habitation of his throne: a fire goeth before him, and burneth up
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023776_0008_0FC123AFB2E2A068"/>his enemies round about. His lightnings enlightened the world; the earth ſaw and trembled. The hills melted like wax at the preſence of the Lord; at the preſence of the Lord of the whole earth. He put on the garments of vengeance for cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and was clad with zeal, as a cloak. According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay—fury to his adverſaries, and recompence to his enemies. And none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, what doſt thou. Hell is naked before him, and deſtruction hath no covering. His eyes are upon the ways of man, and he ſeeth all his goings: there is no darkneſs, nor ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death where the workers of iniquity may hide themſelves. There is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is not manifeſt in his ſight. Now, conſider this, ye that forget GOD, leſt he tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver you.</p>

All hearts ſhall quake; all faces ſhall ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paleneſs, when Jehovah ſhall viſit the wickedneſs of ſuch as dwell upon this earth; when he ſhall ſcatter hail, fire, and brimſtone, upon the impenitent and the ungodly! O repent in time, and ſeek an intereſt in the atonement of JESUS, whilſt the day of interceſſion laſteth. O ſtrive— wreſtle with GOD, as Jacob wreſtled of old with the ANGEL of the covenant, for the bleſſing: plead with GOD, to have mercy upon you, for the ſake of the world's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; "for he is merciful and gracious,

Now, and in your laſt moments, pray for CHRIST'S univerſal church, to which ye profeſs to belong; and in the communion of which ye deſire to die; that every member of the ſame may live in unity and charity: pray for the protection and bleſſing of GOD up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the land of your pilgrimage, and upon all the people that dwell therein; ſo that all who have "ſold themſelves to work

Godlineſs is great riches, if a man be content with that which he hath; for we brought nothing into the world, neither may we carry any thing out. And having food and raiment, let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023776_0013_0FC123C7A5DE3AA8"/>be content. But they that will be rich, fall into temptation, and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition. For the <hi>love</hi> of money is the <hi>root</hi> of all evil; which, while ſome coveted after, they have erred from the ſaith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows. <hi>Therefore,</hi> let him that ſtole, ſteal no more; but rather let him labor, working with his hands, the thing that is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth. The thoughts of the diligent tend to plenteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but the robbery of the wicked ſhall deſtroy them. Speak every man truth to his neighbor, and love no falſe oath. Know this, that the LAW is not made for a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, but for the lawleſs and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, for the ungodly and for ſinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and murtherers of mothers, for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayers, for whore-mongers, for them that defile themſelves with mankind, for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtealers, for liars, for perjured perſons, and whatever elſe there is contrary to ſound doctrine. Be not deceived; neither forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023776_0016_0FC123CDA5FD72D8"/>he ſhall be exalted and extolled, and be very high. As many were aſtoniſhed at thee; his viſage was ſo marred more than any man, and his form more than the ſons of men: So ſhall he ſprinkle many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: the kings ſhall ſhut their mouths at him: for <hi>that</hi> which had not been told them ſhall they ſee, and <hi>that</hi> which they had not heard ſhall they conſider. Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed? For he ſhall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comelineſs: and when we ſhall ſee him, <hi>there is</hi> no beauty that we ſhould deſire him. He is deſpiſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of men; a man of ſorrows, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with grief: and we hid as it were <hi>our</hi> faces from him: he was deſpiſed, and we eſteemed him not.

Afterwards, the chief prieſts and rulers of the Jews were inſtant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And Pilate gave ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that it ſhould be as they required. And the ſoldiers crucified him! And ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down, they watched him; and ſet up over his head his accuſation, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS! Thus, Jeſus bore our ſins in his own body on the tree; and by being made a curſe for us, redeemed us from the curſe of the law: for it is written, curſeth is every one that hangeth on a tree.

Then the chief prieſts and phariſees went and made the ſepulchre ſure, ſealing the ſtone and ſetting a watch. In the end of the ſabbath, as it began to dawn toward the firſt day of the week, came Mary Magdelene and the other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to ſee the ſepulchre. And behold there was a great earthquake; for the angel of the Lord deſcended from heaven, and came and rolled back the ſtone from the door, and ſat upon it. His counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was like lightning, and his raiment white as ſnow, and for fear of him, the keepers did ſhake, and became as dead men. And <hi>the women</hi> entering into the ſepulchre, ſaw a young man ſitting on the right ſide, clothed in a long white gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and they were affrighted. And he ſaith unto them, be not affrighted; ye ſeek JESUS of Nazareth, who was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he is riſen; he is not here. Why ſeek ye the living (HIM THAT LIVTEH) among the dead? <hi>Afterwards,</hi> the eleven diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples went away into Galilee, into a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain where JESUS had appointed them.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023776_0019_0FC123E2C61EE118"/>And JESUS came and ſpake unto them, ſaying, ALL POWER IS GIVEN UNTO ME IN HEAVEN AND IN EARTH.—Go ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and teach (diſciple) all nations, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them in the name of the FATHER, and of the SON, and of the HOLY GHOST; teaching <hi>them</hi> to obſerve <hi>all things</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have commanded <hi>you;</hi> and lo, I am with you alway even unto the end of the world.

And when he had ſpoken theſe things, while they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their ſight. And while they looked ſtedfaſtly toward heaven, as he went up, behold two men ſtood by them in white apparel, who alſo ſaid,—"ye men of Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee, why ſtand ye gazing up into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?

                  <p>"O Gracious GOD, who haſt ſet forth thy Son Jeſus Chriſt to be a propitiation for the ſins of all mankind, and haſt not excluded any from the covenant of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, who deſire with ſincerity to embrace and apply it:" we preſent our ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in behalf of theſe perſons under ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death, who deſire to confeſs their unworthineſs of the leaſt of thy mercies, yet deſirous to turn to thee in acts of contrition and penitence; humbly imploring thy grace to direct them, the knowledge of thee and of thy Son Jeſus Chriſt to guide them into all truth: that, before they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part hence, they may evidence the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their repentance by fully confeſſing their ſins both againſt thy laws and thoſe of civil ſociety. Teach them to know, that a full and free confeſſion of their crimes, together with a ſuitable diſcovery of their accomplices in robbery, theft, and ſuch like violent and fraudulent deeds, is a debt not leſs due the good of their country in general, and the health of their own ſouls in particular, than the life of their bodies to the demands of inflexible juſtice. May they be deeply humbled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

Work in them, O Father of mercies, every heavenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that ſhall tend to qualify them for joining the company of bleſſed ſpirits, where the temptations of the Devil, the world, and the fleſh ſhall never aſſail them.

                  <p>Man! your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity! The voice of your brother's blood crieth unto the Lord, who hath pronounced you <hi>curſed</hi> from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hands! As I live, ſaith the Lord, I will even do according to your anger, and according to your envy, which you have uſed againſt your brother. The hand of the Almighty hath overtaken you, his hot diſpleaſure flameth againſt the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer! Ah! how have you troubled the land, and cauſed it to mourn becauſe of the innocent blood that you have ſhed therein!
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:023776_0027_0FC123FFEB6B8250"/>Did all your other evil deeds appear but trivial in your eyes, that you muſt ſum them up with the <hi>additional,</hi> the <hi>horrible</hi> guilt of ſheeding innocent blood? Had you then put off the nature of a <hi>man,</hi> and aſſumed that of a <hi>Devil?</hi> But now, that your murderous paſſion has ſubſided, does not the atrocity of your crime harrow up your inmoſt ſoul, and make you, under the moſt powerful conviction of guilt, fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cry out "what ſhall I do to be ſaved and eſcape the wrath to come?" Look at your <hi>hands,</hi> bloody man! do they not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the eye of our diſtempered ſoul, all <hi>crimſoned over,</hi> as when they did the horrid deed! your <hi>clothes,</hi> look at them, all blotted with the gore of him whom you have mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered!—Influenced by the ſpirit of the <hi>evil one,</hi> whoſe delight is in blood, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the human race, you have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageouſly exalted yourſelf againſt the meek and loving ſpirit of HIM, who came into the world to ſave men's lives, and to give his own life a ranſom for many; by doing all that in you lay, to deface the divine likeneſs ſtamped upon you by the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Creator, as alſo to eraſe your brother's name from the catalogue of the living
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:023776_0028_0FC1240173ACB6C8"/>and his exiſtence from the volume of creation! againſt whom have you lifted up your hand? againſt whom have you exalted yourſelf? againſt the HOLY ONE of Iſrael, who is a jealous and avenging GOD, and whoſe ears are always open to the voice of blood: againſt MAN and the LAWS of civil ſociety; for you have broken down the hedge of peace, and plundered man of one of the higheſt bleſſings of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that of <hi>"ſitting quietly under his vine, or under his fig-tree, and none to make him afraid."</hi> Alſo you have ſinned againſt your own life, by incurring a debt, which nothing can pay off, but your blood. And therefore the arrows of the Amighty drink up your ſpirits, and the ſword of temporal juſtice rages furiouſly to have your blood. Jehovah, in tremendous majeſty, on mount Sinai proclaimed this law, "thou ſhalt not kill;" and all nations have adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it into their ſyſtem of juriſprudence. Tell me, ſon of blood, was a man ready to give you the fatal blow, would you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind him of this prohibitory command, and beg of him to ſpare your life, at the price of all you had? Yes, doubtleſs. And did not your conſcience forbid you? Did
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:023776_0028_0FC1240173ACB6C8"/>it not again and again, with the ſtern voice of prohibition, aſk you, "what! <hi>will thou do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt</hi> GOD?" But, your conſcience, O murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er! your conſcience you had artfully ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as with an hot iron! you had labored hard to extinguiſh every ſeed of goodneſs, humanity and virtue in your ſoul! you had deſpiſed the admonitions of conſcience ſo long, that ſhe ceaſed to warn you! you had long turned away your eyes from read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leſſons of divine love and godly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, tendered to you on the page of revelation; and rather choſe to copy into your practice the example of him, who was a murderer from the beginning! GOD was not among your thoughts! Ah! the end of theſe things is death! Think—murderer—think, if all that is human, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the form, hath not quite abandoned you to moſt infernal obduracy of heart, and inſenſibility to the woes of others—think, what poignant anguiſh rends the ſoul of the diſconſolate widow <hi>(here name the kindred, if any)</hi> ſorrowing with the moſt bitter lamentation, for <hi>his</hi> untimely death, whoſe blood your impious hands have poured out, as water upon the ground, that

Suffer ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination to preſent you with a view of the helpleſs orphans bedewing their father's bloody body with floods of tears!—See, with bitter cries and doleful lamentations, the diſconſolate widow falling upon <hi>his</hi> neck and kiſſing that ghaſtly face, which now for wife nor children has no ſmiles— no look of complacency, but the bitterneſs of untimely death ſettled in every feature, expreſſive of the anguiſh of the inner man, when your impious hands tore ſoul and body apart! That parent-eye, which ere while beamed looks of love, gladdening with <hi>his</hi> approbation all the family—thou —how ſhall I addreſs thee!—haſt veiled in darkneſs, no more to behold the light of day—no more to ſee the jovous objects of induſtry and love!—Ah! what haſt thou done!—How has thy murderous touch ſtamped lamentation and woe on every ſcene of their domeſtic happineſs!— No more does the tender glance of pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal eye, returning from the labor of the day, invite the dependant young to claſp their father's knee, or climb up upon him to preſs their ſpotleſs breaſts to <hi>his,</hi> and ſmile like cherubim in <hi>his</hi> face!—No more
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:023776_0029_0FC1240E9E82D638"/>do the cheeks and forehead, furrowed with care and honeſt labor, borrow the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of youth, the inſtant the lovely babes approach to greet their parent welcome, and to ſalute him with their prattling ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and their little loves! O man! bloody man! what haſt thou done! what thick cloud of darkneſs and blackneſs haſt thou brought upon all this gay ſun-ſhine of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity! How haſt thou blaſted, with thy murderous breath, as with a curſe, this fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant bleſſing of GOD upon his ſervants! That body which roſe with the riſing ſun, in order to go forth to honeſt work and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor—with baneful malice, thou haſt ſtopt in its wonted courſe, and extinguiſhed its lamp of light and life, at noon day! Who gave <hi>thee</hi> authority to ſave life or to kill? Haſt <hi>thou</hi> a right of ſovereignty over thy brother? By what authority couldſt <hi>thou</hi> preſume to exert upon him the power of the deſtroying angel of death? But why need I any more to harrow up thy ſoul!— Look inward, baſe man! and if thou canſt ſee through the black darkneſs which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſeth it, view thy guilty conſcience! Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold upon it engraven the words of thy condemnation, <hi>"He that ſheddeth man's
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:023776_0030_0FC1240FA94CC8D0"/>blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed."</hi> The innocent blood thou haſt ſhed, crieth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee from the duſt, with a voice like thunder,—it <hi>will</hi> be heard—and juſtice would ceaſe to be juſtice, were ſhe to ſtop her ears againſt it. Juſtice hath heard the voice of blood, and, miſerable man! your own conſcience beareth witneſs that you are juſtly doomed to die for your offence! to die an ignominious death, to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed accurſed from the earth and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; as it is written, "curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree!"—GOD is juſt and holy, but you have been unjuſt and cruel; and now the meaſure you have meted to another is ready to be meted out to yourſelf.—Your <hi>body,</hi> the inſtrument of your crime, muſt repay <hi>blood for blood,</hi>— your ſoul, by conforming to the conditions offered you by the covenant of evangelical grace, may, and I pray GOD it may, find mercy in the day of his righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, through the merits and interceſſion of Jeſus. You have therefore no time to loſe, no dallying in making up your peace with your highly offended GOD—on every moment hangs your everlaſting happineſs or woe. If yet, while the day of mercy
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:023776_0030_0FC1240FA94CC8D0"/>laſteth, before the interceſſion of Jeſus is finiſhed, you neglect the things that belong to your everlaſting peace—how will dire agonies, and pangs unfelt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſeize upon your guilty ſoul, when you ſhall feel the full force of the wrath of the Omnipotent,—and be delivered over to the inexpreſſible tortures pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Devil and his angels!!!—It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of an angry GOD! And a wounded ſpirit who can bear? Murder and idolatry have ever been obnoxious to the hotteſt indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Jehovah; and have brought down his moſt terrible judgments from time to time, to viſit the earth! For theſe crimes the world has frequently been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to mourn! Murder and idolatry pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Almighty to drown the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men by a flood of waters; to ſend down ſtreams of lived flame from heaven to conſume the cities of Sodom and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah; they occaſioned the ſeveral cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivities of the Jews, and the amazing revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and ſubverſions of government among the Gentiles; they have cauſed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines and peſtilences, and the deſtruction of cities and countries! and finally, as the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:023776_0031_0FC124114E412798"/>EARTH has been in every age and nation ſo greatly polluted with blood, whether in the field of battle, or by the ruffian hand of perſonal violence, or by the blood of numberleſs victims offered to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, by idolatrous nations; IT, with all the words that are thereon, ſhall be burnt up, in the day of the fierce anger of the LORD: but firſt IT ſhall be compelled to deliver up IT'S dead, and to diſcloſe all IT'S ſlain. Alas! who ſhall live when GOD doth this? If, in the day that tribulation and wrath ſhall be poured out upon all the ungodly of the earth, the <hi>righteous</hi> and the <hi>penitent</hi> obtain redemption from the ſecond death and the unextinguiſhable fire, through the merits and interceſſion of a Mediator, where ſhall the ungodly and the impenitent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, who have deſpiſed the interceſſion of Jeſus? therefore, flee, O ſinner, flee from the wrath to come, leſt the long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and patience of GOD toward thee, become like oil caſt on fire, leſt thy guilt and puniſhment preſs thee down to the loweſt depth of miſery! GOD is merciful; if thou canſt repent, yea, if with a true heart thou prayeſt for it, he will grant thee repentance unto life: but in proportion to
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:023776_0031_0FC124114E412798"/>the heinouſneſs of thy crime muſt be the fervency of thy prayer. Did the world's REDEEMER, in atoning for the guilt of man—in paying the redemption-price for penitents, ſweat drops of blood, groan, and voluntarily offer up his pure and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly body to die, the <hi>innocent</hi> for the <hi>guilty,</hi> to reconcile us to GOD; and thinkeſt thou that a few "Lord have mercies," will pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify the offended MAJESTY of heaven and earth? No! If thou deſireſt to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life, having ſo grievouſly offended by breaking the command, <hi>thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> thou muſt copy ſo far as thou canſt, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of thy Lord, when he was in an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony for thy ſins; a due ſenſe of them will rend thy heart, then will flow the fountains of thy tears, ſighs and ſtrong crying, with prayers offered up through the merits and interceſſion of the ADVO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATE for man, will aſcend up before GOD, and prove available for thy pardon. At the right hand of the Eternal, contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually ſtandeth the ANGEL of the covenant, the gracious Mediator, in his human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ready to offer up the ſighs, the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and tears of all penitents, who deſire to come to the Father through him. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:023776_0032_0FC12412B7325730"/>there is no other way of obtaining mercy, but through CHRIST; he is the <hi>way,</hi> the <hi>truth,</hi> and the <hi>life,</hi> and no man can come to the FATHER but by his means. He was called JESUS, becauſe he ſaves his people from the guilt and puniſhment due to their ſins; and as he is appointed the only MEDIATOR between an offended GOD and his offending creature MAN; there is no other NAME given to men, under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, whereby they can be ſaved, but only the name of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, who is GOD over all bleſſed for evermore. Think not, ſinful man, think not of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the pardoning mercy and grace of GOD, by any other means, or on any other conditions, than thoſe of his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; by JESUS CHRIST only, thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt be made whole—therefore, labor to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace with meekneſs and patience, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and promiſes of evangelical grace; pray, earneſtly pray for a portion of that ſpirit which was poured out upon the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent thief on the croſs. Learn to realize the hour of thy death,—let it be as the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to which thou art to bend thy courſe, in order that thou mayeſt, in thy death, be conformed to the death of Jeſus, ſeeing
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:023776_0032_0FC12412B7325730"/>thou wouldeſt not conform to his life in thine. If thou feeleſt no godly ſorrow, no heart-rending woe, how canſt thou preſume to have any hope towards GOD? If thou really feeleſt thy ſpirit ſo exceedingly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted within thee, on account of the blood that is on thy hands, as to allow thee no reſt to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, reaſonably then thou mayeſt hope in GOD; for he is merciful and gracious, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin to the penitent; and takes delight in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a troubled and broken ſpirit.—A broken and a contrite heart GOD will not deſpiſe.—According to thy ſincerity and contrition be it done unto thee.</p>

So ye ſhall not pollute the land wherein ye are; for blood defileth the land, and the land cannot be cleanſed of the blood that is ſhed therein, but by the blood of him that ſhed it. The murderer, riſing with the light, killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is a thief, who ſleepeth not except he hath done ſome miſchief; and whoſe ſleep is taken away unleſs he hath cauſed ſome to fall. Thus the murderer lieth in wait for his own blood, he lurks privily for his own life. The murderer liveth not half his days, for GOD ſhall ſuddenly ſhoot at him with a ſwift arrow, and ſhall overthrow him with his bloody companions. The bloody and deceitful man GOD abhorreth; and ſuch ſhall have their part in the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death.</p>

O may this prayer be heard, and I truſt it will, for the prayer of the righteous availeth much. But, is it, O my GOD, is it in wrath, or in mercy, that thou haſt commiſſioned inexorable juſtice, to ſtop up the way before me, to ſhut me up in the dungeon, and appoint me an ignominious death on a gallows? With tears of the moſt heart-rending pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itence, I deplore—that I have deſpiſed the light, the light of life, and now the Sun in the heavens diſdains to ſhine upon me. Yet, my ſoul, becauſe the mercy of my GOD is over all his works, I will hope he hath done all theſe things to me in mercy. I will hope he hath not caſt me off for ever, but by ſending his ſervants the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned executioners of temporal juſtice,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:023776_0041_0FC1243F2EFB6B88"/>from time to time to call upon me with the loud thundering voice of the LAW, by <hi>impriſonments,</hi> by <hi>ſcourgings,</hi> and by various correcting diſpenſations, he intended that I ſhould learn conſideration, and aſk my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, "ah! me, what have I done?" But alas! charmed to ſleep in the lap of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence, by the deep and repeated draughts I had taken of the bewitching cup of vice, I turned away mine ear, and like the deaf adder, would liſten to nothing ſhort of the thunderings of legal condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now do I feel, as if awaked out of a deep ſleep; before, I was not myſelf— carried away captive both by evil compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and an evil heart; depraved affections continually ordering me about the Devil's ſervice! Wiſely and juſtly, haſt thou thus dealt by me, O offended Father! when gentler corrections were found ineffectual, in mercy haſt thou been pleaſed to compel me, an infamous wretch, and abominable prodigal, "to come to myſelf."—"Come to myſelf"—I tremble—I ſtand amazed —Oh!—it is impoſſible for this heart to conceive how great my guilt has been!!! O how merciful has my heavenly Father been to me, that when I was ſo ſteeled in
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:023776_0042_0FC124451D4E9040"/>vice, as to be beyond the reach of gentler methods, even <hi>thus</hi> to arreſt me, in my way to deſtruction, and draw me to him by a paternal but juſtifiable violence!—Had my GOD caſt me quite out of his ſight, as a maſs of crimes and impenitency, no more to be the object of his care, and delivered me over to the powers of darkneſs, to whom, alas! I had entirely devoted myſelf, what muſt have been my final portion?—Think, O my ſoul, think ſeriouſly—had the plunge of an avenging <hi>ſword,</hi> or the well-aimed <hi>ball</hi> ſent me to eternity, with all my robberies, thefts, burglaries, lies, oaths, crimes, and evil words and deeds beyond number, hanging heavy upon my ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders—no time allowed for repentance—no power granted, not even ſo much as to pray "Lord have mercy upon me!"—O horrible! horrible! horrible!!! My ſoul, thou recoileſt at the tremendous thought, like a man from the brink of ſome dreadful precipice, ready to fall and involve him in its ruins!</p>
