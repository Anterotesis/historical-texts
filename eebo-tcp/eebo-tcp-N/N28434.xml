            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>UNITED AMERICA aſſemble this day to pay their laſt reſpects to the admired hero and ſage, the father of his country, the friend of mankind. He hath reſigned his ſpirit into the hand of his maker. "He lives only in his own great actions, and in the hearts of an affectionate and afflicted people."</p>
            <p>A FAITHFUL hiſtory of his life, and an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial delineation of his public and private virtues, would be the only eulogy worthy of WASHINGTON. But who can define that ſublime philoſophy which directed and animated all his actions—his genius enriched with information and fruitful in reſources —his wiſely concerted and well executed plans! Who can deſcribe his purity of morals, dignity of manners, mildneſs and equanimity, patience in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity and moderation in proſperity, firmneſs in danger and perſeverance in difficulties! If, in the ſketch of his hiſtory and character, a ſtrong affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the man ſhould appear, blended with a rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence for his talents, your candor and the ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of your feelings will be the ſpeaker's apology.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:037886_0003_100F61FF308CD158"/>THIS day completes ſixty eight years ſince the pariſh of Waſhington, in the county of Weſtmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in Virginia, gave birth to this great man. He was educated by private inſtruction. An excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent underſtanding early convinced him of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of virtue, the pleaſure of knowledge, and the neceſſity of labor. An uncommon mildneſs and moderation of temper preſerved him from the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of paſſion, and the allurements of vice. By the natural ſtrength and ſuperiority of his genius, without experience, he broke out at once a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and a hero. At the age of twenty-three, he was ſent, by his native ſtate, with the command of four hundred men againſt the French, in the vicin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the Ohio, who had committed many acts of hoſtility againſt the Britiſh ſubjects. Attacked at Redſtone, by an army nearly four times as nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as his own, valiant as Achilles, he made a brave defence, killed two hundred of the enemy, and obliged the French to grant him an honorable capitulation. The maſterly manner in which he ſoon after covered the retreating army of Gen. Braddock, drew upon him the higheſt encomiums from his country. Through the whole of that war, he diſplayed an energy of character, which preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that he might be deſigned by Providence for a future ſaviour of his country.</p>
            <p>IN the Congreſs of 1775 he was diſtinguiſhed by every deference, which ſuperior merit is ſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from noble minds. He felt an early indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the oppreſſions of the Britiſh. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037886_0004_100F62018B270AA0"/>
of her armies being intruſted to him by his country, he accepted it from duty, relinquiſhing the enjoyments of affluence, and the higheſt domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic felicity. Having no intereſted views, the friends of liberty repoſed the higheſt confidence in his abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities and integrity. How well this confidence was placed, every page of our revolution bears glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous atteſtation. What difficulties did he not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter? What danger did he decline? Who has marked his fortitude in the hour of adverſity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hoping relief from his prudence? Who has beheld him in battle, without confiding in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his arrangements, and repoſing on the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of his arm? Who, among his followers, did not find his ſufferings ſolaced in ſeeing them ſhared by his chief? Thoſe can beſt deſcribe his military character, who followed him in his expeditions, who ſtudied his marches, his encampments, his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions before a battle, and his courage in the heat of conflict; who beheld him penetrating, at a glance, the projects of the enemy, multiplying around them almoſt inevitable ambuſhes, creating and preſerving a happy diſcipline in his army, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing, by new and efficacious methods, the ardor of his ſoldiers, and unremittingly exerting himſelf for their preſervation.</p>
            <p>TO view him as a perfect model of military great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to rank him with the greateſt generals of any age, is no amplification. In him were blended ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, vigilance, great force of judgment, and never failing preſence of mind. He could unite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037886_0005_100F620327962BA8"/>
with talents, reflection with experience, and ſtratagem with glory. Cautious, ſyſtematic, and inflexible, his genius was ſingularly adapted to our revolutionary war. Diſtinguiſhing, with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, the difference between great difficulties and impoſſibilities, and never diſcouraged by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, he often appeared to execute the latter. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigably laborious and active, coolly intrepid in action, he diſcerned as by intuition, ſeized with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and improved with ſkill, the favorable, and often deciſive, moments of battle. Never tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the enthuſiaſm of patriotiſm, never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by the ardor of courage, he preferred ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem to action, and victory to glory. Modeſt and magnanimous after victory, he became the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous protector of his ſubdued and captive enemies. Reſolute and undejected in misfortunes, he roſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to diſtreſſes, and ſurmounted difficulties, which no courage, no conſtancy, but his own, would have reſiſted. His letters, during his moſt gloomy proſpects, announce a hero, conſcious of his danger, but ſtill deriving a well grounded hope from the reſources of his own mind. His valor was never unequal to his duty or the occaſion. He attempted great things with means that appeared totally inadequate, and ſucceſsfully proſecuted what he had boldly reſolved. He was never diſheartened by difficulties, but had that vigor of mind, which, inſtead of bending to oppoſition, riſes above it, and ſeems to have a power of controling even fortune itſelf. His character combined a cool and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating judgment and prompt deciſion, caution and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037886_0006_100F6205894F3590"/>
intrepidity, patience and enterpriſe, generous ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and compaſſion, with undaunted heroiſm. He was a never failing reſource to thoſe who want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his aſſiſtance. No one could have more happily concentrated the confidence of his troops. Their obedience was leſs owing to the authority of his poſt, than to their opinion of his valor; ſo attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him were the officers and ſoldiers, that if a principle of duty and virtue had not ſecured their obedience to their country, gratitude and reſpect for their general would have confirmed it. Even when worn out with fatigue they were ever ready to execute his orders, and no danger could intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date them when they were commanded by WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON. He himſelf always ſhared in the toils he was obliged to impoſe, viſited in perſon the ſick and the wounded, and expreſſed, on every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the greateſt regard for a body of men, whoſe welfare was ſo cloſely connected with that of his country. By the ſtricteſt rules he labored to inſpire them with a ſenſe of duty, and neglected no cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which might render them formidable to their enemies. He was eloquent, perſuaſive, ſtrong, and pathetic, as occaſion required. He had argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and tears at his command. In a word, he was a general formed by heaven for juſt ſuch a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, country, and cauſe, as ours. And you too well know to be informed, that his great talents and patriotiſm, his equally judicious and vigorous meaſures, effected the ſalvation of his country, and commanded the admiration and applauſe of the whole world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:037886_0007_100F62098D6F83A0"/>AFTER the ratification of a treaty of peace, which ſatisfied our moſt ſanguine wiſhes and expectations, he reſigned his commiſſion, enjoying the pleaſing hope of ſpending the reſidue of his days in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats and occupations of private life. Having paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a rapid revolution from the dangers of ſlavery to the poſſeſſion of liberty, the whole country, in the tranſports of gratitude, forgot their own mighty exertions, the influence of general cauſes, and the irreſiſtible energy of man fighting for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and aſcribed their ſucceſs to the virtues and talents of WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>THE character of this great man would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by a compariſon with the moſt diſtinguiſhed generals either of ancient or modern times. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, Charles</hi> of Sweden, and <hi>Kouli Khan,</hi> were born with an inſatiable thirſt for human blood, and habituated, from their infancy, to the moſt inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man actions. Their immoderate ambition made them the ſcourge of mankind and the peſt of the world.—<hi>Hannibal's</hi> talents and victories were tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by cruelty, treachery, and a total diſregard to truth, honor, and morality.—<hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was provident in council, fearleſs in action, humane and generous to exceſs; but his glory was ſullied by an inordinate love of pleaſure, and an unbounded ambition. His great talents would have made him the firſt citizen of Rome; but he diſdained the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a ſubject. The great object of his life was to rule, and Cato very juſtly remarked, that "he came, with ſobriety and meditation, to the ſubverſion
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037886_0008_100F620BDEBBC088"/>
of the republic."—None ever exhibited greater bravery in dangerous undertakings, or more preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of mind and conduct in their execution, than <hi>Trajan</hi>; but the praiſes of Alexander, blazoned by a ſucceſſion of panegyriſts, kindled a dangerous emulation in his mind. "Like him," ſays Gibbon, "the Roman emperor undertook an expedition againſt the nations of the eaſt; but he lamented, with a ſigh, that his advanced age ſcarcely left him any hopes of equalling the renown of the ſon of Phillip."—<hi>Charles the firſt</hi> of France, <hi>Edward the third</hi> of England, and the Emperor <hi>Charles the fifth,</hi> diſplayed aſtoniſhing military talents, and were not leſs illuſtrious in the cabinet than in the field. But the firſt wantonly maſſacred 4500 Saxons ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their loyalty to their prince. He appeared to regard truth, juſtice, and humanity, only as impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate monitors, which ſhould be kept at a diſtance, or puniſhed for their intruſion. The love of glory was the ruling paſſion of the two laſt, to the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of which they ſacrificed the intereſts of their country, and every ſentiment of humanity.—<hi>Fred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erick the ſecond</hi> and the <hi>Duke of Marlborough</hi> were, perhaps, perfect maſters of the military art. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been, from their childhood, continually in war, and at the head of armies, they joined to all the capacity which genius could give, all the knowledge and ſkill whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h experience could teach. But the former "ſlaughtered the armies of half the nations of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, merely to extend the limits of an electorate," and, being an open conſpirator againſt the religion of JESUS, infected the world with his impieties—the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037886_0009_100F28C24683B980"/>
latter, hurried to exceſs by the violence of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, was much leſs fitted to prevent evils by his wiſe precautions, than to remedy them by his vigor and enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>NONE of theſe heroes could claim the aſſemblage of coolneſs and ſpirit, humanity and munificence, prudence and vigor, patient unſhaken conſtancy, untainted patriotiſm and ſuperiority to popular clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, which diſtinguiſhed the Father of our country. None of them eſtabliſhed the freedom and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of his nation; or exchanged the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of war for the implements of huſbandry; or was rewarded by the honeſt pride of virtue, the exquiſite delight of beholding the general hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of which he was the author. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of armies are taught, by the example of WASHINGTON, that well earned military applauſes may be preſerved, without power or ſplendor, in private life.</p>
            <p>RESTORED to his endeared retirement, and to thoſe rural occupations which conſtituted his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enjoyment, he was ſcarcely permitted to repoſe from the fatigues of the war, when the imperious voice of his country again ſummoned him to her aſſiſtance. The confederation, formed under the preſſure of foreign war and domeſtic diſtreſs, was found incompetent to the ends propoſed, and both the honor and happineſs of the United States requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a reformation. For this purpoſe a convention was called in the year 1787, of which he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Preſident. His opinions and example, at this

time, largely contributed to a ſpirit of national ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, and ſecured an harmonious acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in our preſent ſyſtem of federal government. Invited by his fellow-citizens to organize and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter this government, he complied, without bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancing a moment between perſonal conſiderations and public duty. His acceptance was the preſage of a proſperity, which was to remedy the evils of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal diſſenſions and a feeble government. Cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him as the anchor of their hope, the people were not diſappointed. Of the ability and integrity with which he diſcharged the functions of this high and arduous office, the public voice and public re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret bear ample and merited teſtimony. It may, indeed, be truly ſaid, that the annals of no nation record a ſeries of ſervices, commenſurate in their conſequences, with thoſe, which he rendered his country, during his adminiſtration. To an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed ardor for the public good, he joined a perſeverance in the purſuit of it, which ſubdued all obſtacles. His genius, adequate to every trying occaſion, appeared to expand as difficulties occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. His diſcerning judgment filled the ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments of ſtate with officers of approved merit, with whom he invariably conſulted, before he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially decided, on buſineſs of moment to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. His well timed and efficient meaſures preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from the deſolation and horrors of foreign and domeſtic war. Under his adminiſtration, the excellent organization of the different branches of the federal conſtitution, the judicious appointments, and the energy applied to all its operations, gave it a baſis which ſecured the happineſs and proſperity of our country.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:037886_0011_100F6213162E92D8"/>IN no ſituation did WASHINGTON appear more truly great than at the helm of our federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Here he diſplayed an aſtoniſhing extent and preciſion of political talents, a diſintereſted integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, an incorruptible heart, a conſtant attention to the grand principles of rational liberty, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable attachment to his country. His genius was equal to the moſt enlarged views, and minute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails, of civil policy. A vigorous mind, improved by the experience and ſtudy of mankind, dexterity and application in buſineſs, a judicious mixture of liberality and oeconomy, ſteadineſs to purſue his ends, and flexibility to vary his means, marked his adminiſtration. He guided the paſſions of others, becauſe he was maſter of his own. Had his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter and feelings been more fervid, his conduct might not have been ſo exemplary, nor his glory ſo exalted and permanent. Patriotic from principle, and temperate from conſtitution, he neither diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor ſought elevation; but always retained a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, which demonſtrated, even to political jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſy, that a man, capable of bearing ſo many hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, fully deſerved them. He was provident with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out timidity, ſevere in the execution of juſtice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rigor, moderate when his own intereſts were the ſubject of diſcuſſion, and inflexibly firm when thoſe of his country were in queſtion. He ſtood a rock in the midſt of the ocean, receiving unmoved the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of its waves.</p>
            <p>WHEN the revolving period of the third election of a Preſident approached, he conſidered that duty no longer demanded a ſacrifice of inclination, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037886_0012_100F62149BC99A08"/>
publiſhed his valedictory addreſs to the people of the United States. In this ſecond reſignation he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſuperior to ancient or modern examples. Oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have, indeed, relinquiſhed offices of equal truſt; but, generally, the viciſſitudes of fortune, and the diſappointment of their favorite ſchemes, urged them to abdicate a power, which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to their ambition.</p>
            <p>THE American leader now conſoled himſelf with the reflection, that he had entirely quitted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant anxiety and high reſponſibility of public life. Minds long exerciſed in buſineſs rarely form habits of converſing with themſelves, and, in the loſs of power, principally regret the want of occupation. But retirement was natural and delightful to WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON. He diſcharged the duties of a private cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izen with a condeſcenſion and greatneſs of mind peculiar to himſelf. He had, however, been too long in the public ſervice to enjoy, without diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the comforts and ſecurity of retirement. "Angry clouds began to riſe:" And it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that he could be unaffected with the afflictions and dangers of his country. At the public call he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain came forward to direct and command our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, exhibiting another proof of unrivalled great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. On this pinnacle of earthly glory he ſtood, "venerable in ſervices as in years, the cement and bulwark of our nation," till he was ſummoned to join <hi>the armies in heaven.</hi>

            <p>THE private character of this great man emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently correſponded with the ſplendor of his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037886_0013_100F621670C248D8"/>
reputation. The native ſimplicity of his virtue was a ſtranger to vanity or affectation. He enjoyed, with moderation, the advantages of his fortune, and the innocent pleaſures of ſociety. He was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere to himſelf, indulgent to the imperfections of others, juſt and beneficent to all mankind. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and candor, a true ſenſe of honor, juſtice, and public liberty, appeared to be the inherent prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of his nature, and the uniform rule of his conduct. The largeneſs of his heart equalled that of his fortune. Without thinking of his own greatneſs, without fearing leſt others ſhould forget it, he was eaſy of acceſs, untainted with rancor or jealouſy, and ever ready to liſten to juſt complaints. "He appears," indeed, "to have been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete model of that perfect character, which, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the denomination of a ſage or a wiſe man, the philoſophers have been fond of delineating, rather as a fiction of their imagination, than in hope of ever ſeeing it reduced to practice—ſo happily were all his virtues tempered together, ſo juſtly were they blended, and ſo powerfully did each prevent the other from exceeding its proper bounds." In a word, co-temporary jealouſy, envy, and malignity, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to applaud both his public and private char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, and more impartial poſterity will read it with admiration.</p>
            <p>HIS fortitude, in the laſt ſcene of his invaluable life, gave an illuſtrious ſtamp to the traits he had exhibited. Oppreſſed by grievous pain, he breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his laſt with the ſublime tranquillity of a good man, conſcious of having devoted his talents to the ſervice of virtue and mankind.</p>

            <p>SUCH was the man for whom our country mourns. Humanity cannot withhold her tears. We have been deprived of our brighteſt ornament, of the guide and patron, on whoſe wiſdom, experience, and harmonizing influence, we could implicitly rely. To him as the author of our independence, and, while he lived, its firm ſupport, our reverence is particularly due. "He could paſs through no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican ſtate, ſurvey no field, and tread on no ſpot of ground, which he did not ſave from devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." He could "mix with no aſſembly, viſit no family, and accoſt no perſon, who muſt not ſay, <hi>Our freedom, our peace, our ſafety, we owe firſt to God, and next to you."</hi> He could "turn his ear to no ſound of joy, which he had not a ſhare in exciting; and open his eye to no ſcene of comfort, which did not trace him as its origin." Like the central orb of the planetary world, he enlightened and anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, cemented and beautified, our whole political ſyſtem. With a ſkilful, ſteady, yet gentle, hand, he moulded a confuſed maſs of diſcordant materials in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one regular and harmonious compound. And by a ſtrictly juſt and paternal adminiſtration, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

have replied: "Support your government. Reſiſt with care the ſpirit of innovation upon its firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, however ſpecious the pretexts. In all the changes to which you may be invited, remember, particularly, that for the efficient management of your common intereſt, in a country ſo extenſive, a government of as much vigor as is conſiſtent with the perfect ſecurity of rational liberty, is indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Reverence religion and morality. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotiſm, who would labor to ſubvert theſe great pillars of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man happineſs, and the firmeſt props of the duties of men and citizens. Promote inſtitutions for the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral diffuſion of knowledge. As an important ſource of ſtrength and ſecurity, cheriſh public credit. Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate peace and harmony with all nations. Exclude inveterate antipathies againſt ſome, and paſſionate attachments for others. The nation which indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges towards another an habitual hatred or an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual fondneſs, is a ſlave to its animoſity or to its affection, either of which is ſufficient to pervert it from its duty and intereſt. If I may flatter myſelf, that theſe counſels of an old, affectionate friend may be productive of ſome partial benefit, of ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional good—that they may ſometimes recur to mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate the fury of party ſpirit, to warn againſt the miſchiefs of foreign influence, and to guard againſt the impoſtures of pretended patriotiſm; this hope will be a full recompence for the ſolicitude for your your welfare by which they have been dictated."<note n="*" place="bottom">See Gen.
