            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE assemblage of free and enlightened minds is ever interesting and august. Usefulness marks even their recreations; and the object of their festivals is the perpetuity of their country's honor.</p>
            <p>THE anniversary of that great day when our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was born, when our independence of all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreign power was proclaimed, is the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted occasion for serious, deep reflection, for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, grateful acknowledgment.</p>
            <p>THIS day we consecrate to the fame of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's virtues, the principles of our revolution, and the rising glory of our country.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER circumstances more immediately favoured the revolution, its distant causes we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognize in the conduct, and trace its remote source
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:027520_0005_0FD49FA5F4A23670"/>
from the character of our ancestors. Their set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement in America is a phoenomenon in history. If we revert to ancient nations we find their origin disguised by fiction, or inveloped in obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. If we descend to more modern times and contemplate the birth of European empires, we behold fierce and unlettered barbarians pouring forth in successive swarms from the unexplored re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the North, spreading havoc and desolation in their progress, shrouding the light of science in thick clouds of superstition, and entailing those fetters of slavery, which the convulsive efforts of their posterity to unrivet, now crimson their soil with blood. Similar horrors marked the entrance of the Spaniards on the southern continent. To satiate the demands of unbounded avarice, two opulent and peaceful empires, consisting of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of polished and intelligent people, abounding with monuments of art and industry, with luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant fields and magnificent cities, the chosen seats of cultivation and plenty, were ravaged, depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and destroyed. The laws of hospitality, liberally observed by a beneficent people, were basely violated, and the cross uplifted to sanction the most atrocious crimes.</p>
            <p>CONTRASTED with the conduct of such adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:027520_0006_0FD49FAB1FEB3FD8"/>
what examples of moderation, justice and magnanimity did our ancestors exhibit. Among them are seen no vagrant miscreants roaming in foreign climes in pursuit of that wealth which ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or vice prevented them from acquiring in their own; but illumined and discerning minds, prompted by the noblest of motives, the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of civil and religious liberty, relinquishing estates, kindred and country, traversing a widely extended ocean, encountering unaccustomed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clemencies of season, inhospitable wilds, and all the uncertainties of an infant settlement. Regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less of royal grants or nugatory charters, the sport of philosophy, and the ridicule of reason, they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied no portion of the soil until they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed with its possessors an ample equivalent. Instead of spreading misery and desolation in the abodes of happiness and peace, they instructed the savage natives in the arts, and supplied their wants with the conveniences of civilized life. They tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered their ferocious manners by disseminating among them the truths of that religion, whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts are peace, and whose foundation is humanity.</p>
            <p>SENSIBLE of the value of that liberty which they had made so many sacrifices to attain, their first at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was pointed to the means of securing it for
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:027520_0007_0FD49FACB4B2CC88"/>
their children. Hence originated those literary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, which have diffused a degree of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation unknown in those enslaved countries where learning, like other natural rights, has been mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolized by the few, only to multiply, to subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize, and refine the miseries of the many. Hence also those distributive laws, which render the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of property comparatively equal. With us no elder born exclusively riots on the spoils of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial industry, no nerveless arm or vacant head burlesques a title conserved by public admiration on a wise or valiant ancestor. Intelligence, indus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious habits and social equality were the legacies which our fathers transmitted to their posterity, and experience has proved them more powerful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servatives from oppression and tyranny than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded opulence or veteran armies.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH persecution caused the migration to this country, its inhabitants still cherished the warmth of filial affection to the parent state. This was evinced by a patient acquiescence in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly of trade, and many arbitrary restrictions on manufactures. Even when the despotic edict was issued, which declared her right to bind her colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in all cases whatsoever, their first recourse was to supplication and entreaty. In vain, however, did they address the justice and magnanimity of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:027520_0008_0FD49FAE44CE6860"/>
Britain, and conjure her by the ties of kindred only to lighten the accumulated load of oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. In vain did they approach her with humble petition and respectful remonstrance<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to petition, she replied by injury; to remonstrance, she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered by arms. That flame, which affection and prudence had so long repressed, now burst forth with irresistible fury. Reiterated injuries and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied oppression, had enkindled an enthusiasm uncontroled by the idea of impracticability or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and at a moment when veteran armies were ravaging our coasts, and triumphant fleets mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing our shores, the birth of our nation was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. America sent up an approving, exulting shout, her morning stars sang for joy, while the responsive earth echoed their melodious notes with glowing emulation.</p>
            <p>THE illustrious patriot, whose name first sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the august decree, which gave existence to an empire, cannot be recollected without mingled emotions of grief and admiration. That voice now sleeps in eternal silence, whose animated strains, in yonder hall of liberty, once roused your tardy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments, and impelled your souls to heroic reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. That heart, whose expanded affections em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced all your concerns with the ardor of patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027520_0009_0FD49FAFB3A826D0"/>
now lies compressed by the clod of the valley. His illustrious deeds are engraven on the hearts of his countrymen, and shall be called to grateful recollection, oft as the annual acclamations of emancipated myriads shall hail the return of this auspicious day, which consecrated a new era in the annals of freedom.</p>
            <p>THAT reliance on the Supreme Ruler of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse expressed in the first national act, and which marked the conduct of our rulers during the whole struggle for freedom, will account for their consis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent steady attention to the public welfare, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense of all party views, or private considerations. Enthusiasm, excited by the fervid heat of transient patriotism, may serve as a temporary substitute for religion, but can never permanently supply its place. Men of superior talents, uncontroled by any principle stronger than the impulse of passion, rush with equal ardor into opposite extremes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the most sublime and most atrocious actions, and inspire alternate love and detestation. But the uniform inflexible patriot, equally qualified to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play the magnanimous energies requisite in the tempestuous season of public calamity, or the mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er virtues which secure happiness in the calm of peace, regardless of airy fame, or the gratification
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:027520_0010_0FD49FB50420F220"/>
of momentary popular humours, still makes the unerring rule of rectitude his guide, and appeals for approbation to his GOD. Characters like this adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the American revolution, and preserved unanim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity unparalleled in the history of any other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Among the first of these we rank the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sage, who, after a long unsullied life of patriotic labours, now dignifies the first office in this State, by the unabated exertion of extraordinary talents and virtues.</p>
            <p>A CONTEST, originating in the purest motives, was crowned with the most distinguished success, and the ninth revolving season beheld our country in the complete possession of peace, liberty, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence.</p>
            <p>IT could not be expected of men that in the tumultuous years of resistance, they should have been able to ordain and erect those perfect modes of government, that should remain the permanent pillars of civil liberty. Nor can it surprise us, that the first moments of quiet after recent convulsion, should not suddenly furnish the means of ample reward to the meritorious. But relaxation, debil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and disunion too strongly marked the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing period. Our country beheld with too great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference men who, to secure the freedom and peace
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:027520_0011_0FD49FB68332FC28"/>
of its citizens, had encountered the hardships of the field, the perils and vicissitudes of war, sinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded into indigence and wretchedness. This neglect compelled them to sacrifice the evidence of their demands against the public, and to this source may be traced that injustice, the odium of which discontented minds have, with sedulous assiduity, attempted to throw on the present government. A government which, like most human blessings, is undervalued only by those who enjoy its benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant influence. Its basis, a constitution fabricated by the collected wisdom of the continent, by those sages and heroes, whose united prudence and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour had emancipated their country from the yoke of foreign oppression. A constitution not sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resorted to, as a refuge from internal convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or a safeguard from foreign violence, but calmly discussed and deliberately adopted by an illumined people, when the voice of faction had long been hushed, and the mild whispers of peace were heard throughout the land.</p>
            <p>THE united voice of the people has repeatedly summoned to preside in the national government, that illustrious patriot, whose successful efforts in the field had so often conducted their armies to victory. The exalted head, which had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled by a more verdant laurel than that which
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027520_0012_0FD49FB81BDFDD40"/>
adorned the brow of Fabius, now wears a wreath more glorious than that which dignified the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Solon. The unequalled General stands the unrivalled statesman. To draw a just portrait of a character so exalted is equally beyond the lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its of the occasion and the abilities of the speaker. Before an assembly of Americans the attempt is unnecessary. To them the name of WASHINGTON, the splendor of his actions, and the glory of his virtue, are inscribed on every public scene which is interesting either in recollection or in prospect. And the eulogium, which their mingled gratitude, esteem and admiration demand, is as much above the power of language to express, as the rewards due to his piety, magnanimity and patriotism ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the recompense of all terrestrial crowns and honors.</p>
            <p>THE effects of the event we this day commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate were not confined to our own country, but soon extended across the atlantic. The prospect of humbling a powerful rival induced an arbitrary prince to aid the American cause with numerous armies and powerful fleets, exhibiting the paradox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical appearance of slavery fighting the battles of freedom. The subjects of despotism soon imbibed the principles they were employed to defend, and caught the ardor which flamed in the American

bosom. Surrounding circumstances led to reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions highly unfavorable to their own situation. They perceived the tree of liberty profusely water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their blood, its foliage spreading, yet yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them no shelter, its fruit blooming and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in luxuriance, yet denied the delicious taste, it excited no passion but despair. When the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date of their sovereign summoned them to their native shores a deeper horror seemed to shade the darkness of despotism. They beheld with min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled grief and indignation a people in the most fertile country of Europe, amid the profusion of the bounties of nature, obliged to live on the glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their own industry. The scanty pittance, saved from the exactions of arbitrary power, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ignorance and superstition, to satisfy the boundless demands of a rapacious clergy. A king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom converted to a bastile, in which the mind was imprisoned by a triple impenetrable wall of ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, superstition and despotism. The fervid spirit which glowed within them, soon pervaded their country, and threatened destruction to their gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. On the first favorable contingency, the enthusiastic energies of reviving freedom burst the cearments which had confined it for two thousand years, and the gothic fabric of feudal absurdity, with all its pompous pageants, colossal pillars and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:027520_0014_0FD49FBF1301E3F8"/>
proscriptive bulwarks, the wonder and veneration of ages, was instantly levelled with the dust.</p>
            <p>AN astonished world viewed with awful admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the stupendous wreck. They beheld with pleasing exultation the fair fabric of freedom rising in simple proportion and majestic grace upon the mighty ruin. The gloomy horrors of despotism fled before the splendid effulgence of the sun of liberty. The potent rays of science pierced the mist of ignorance and error, "republican visions were realized, and the reign of reason appeared to commence its splendid progress." But the whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind of discord threatened to raze the fabric from its foundation. The lowering clouds of contention hung around and darkened the horizon. Fayette, the apostle of liberty, was abandoned by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom he saved, and became a victim to despo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic cruelty and cowardice. The damp poisonous exhalations of a gloomy dungeon now encircle and chill that bosom, whose philanthropy was coexten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive with the universe, whose patriotism no power could extinguish, no dangers appal. But illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by the rectitude of thy heart and the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity of thy virtue, the trickling dews of thy prison walls, shall sparkle with more enviable lustre than the most luminous diadem that glitters on the brow of the haughtiest emperor.</p>

CANDOR will make every allowance for the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities of an immense people who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated into insurrection by the extreme of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional calamity. Who had not been previously prepared for a revolution by the slow progressive improvements of education. They possessed no happy constitution, including within itself the safe and regular means of redressing such abuses as experience must discover, or such inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as an alteration of circumstances must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>produce in the best system of government. Their political institutions, the accumulated abuses of ages were so entirely corrupt, that they would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no reform, nor could any remedy be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed less powerful than regeneration. In attempting this work they were opposed by those numerous or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of clergy and nobility, who had so long mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolized the wealth and power of the nation, and by the selfish designs of those artful, factious men, who are continually raising popular commotions, that they may by them accomplish their detestable purposes. While perplexed with these internal difficulties, they were attacked from without by nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous armies of combined kings, whose avowed object was the restoration of that tyranny so recent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly banished. Will the history of past ages pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an example of so great convulsion unattended

by the commission of crimes? Great as these have been, are not the annals of successful despotism blackened with still deeper horror? Remotely situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated as we are from the scene of action, our sources of information few, and those discoloured by party and corrupted by faction, we cannot determine where to censure or how far to applaud. This uncertainty must remain until the tumult of passion has subsided and facts shall be fairly ascertained from the pen of an impartial historian.</p>
            <p>A QUESTION of the highest magnitude remains to be determined by the event of the present Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean contest. A question, which affects not France, not the present age only, but which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces the interest of the whole European world and its remotest posterity. Should that nation be subdued by external force or internal treachery, the tyrants who now totter on their thrones, will exult in perfect security, and the shackles of slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be more firmly rivetted on the subjects of their arbitrary governments. But should success crown their efforts, and republicanism, unsullied by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy, be established among them, despotism will be destroyed, and the principles of enlightened liberty pervade the universe.</p>

SEPARATED by an immense ocean we fondly hoped to remain unshaken by the convulsions of Europe. But the depredations made on our late flourishing commerce, has defeated the illusory ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. Piratical spoliations have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted under colour of a British edict unfounded in the laws of nature or nations. The savages of the ocean have crept from their lurking place and seized with relentless hands our unwary mariners. With fearful apprehension we beheld a dark cloud spread itself over our hemisphere and threaten to pour forth a deluge of misery on our devoted shores. But the cloud is broken and scattering. The Mediterranean again imprisons the barbarians of Afric, and we trust that pacific negociation will procure retributive justice from Britain, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the necessity of a resort to arms. The sources of wealth will again open and the prolific streams pour from both Indias in plentiful abundance. The busy hum of men already pervades our cheerful streets, our crowded ports echo the shouts of hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried seamen, commerce whitens our seas, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing Ceres spreads the gifts of harvest waving luxuriant o'er our fertile plains.</p>
            <p>AMERICANS! you have a country vast in extent and embracing all the varieties of the most salubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

climes. Held not by charters wrested from unwilling kings, but the bountiful gift of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Nature. The exuberance of your popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is daily divesting the dreary desart of its rude attire, and splendid cities rise to cheer the gloomy wilderness. You have a government deservedly celebrated as "giving the sanctions of law to the precepts of reason," presenting, instead of the rank luxuriance of natural licentiousness, the corrected sweets of civil liberty. You have fought the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of freedom and enkindled that sacred flame which now glows with vivid fervor through the greatest empire in Europe. We indulge the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine hope that her equal laws and virtuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct will hereafter afford examples of imitation to all surrounding nations. That the blissful period will soon arrive when man shall be elevated to his primitive character, when illuminated reason and regulated liberty shall once more exhibit him in the image of his Maker. When all the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of the globe shall be freemen and fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and patriotism itself be lost in universal phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropy. Then shall volumes of incense inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly roll from altars inscribed to liberty. "Then shall the innumerable varieties of the human race unitedly "worship in her sacred temple, whose pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars shall rest on the remotest corners of the earth, and whose arch will be the vault of heaven."</p>
