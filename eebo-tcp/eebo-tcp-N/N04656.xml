            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM XXVI. 8.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>LORD, I have loved the Habitation of thy Houſe, and the Place where thine Honour dwelleth.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>HAVING by <hi>the good Hand of our GOD towards us,</hi> with ſo much happy Unanimity and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch, built this Houſe to the Honour of his Name; and it being henceforward to be dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to his more immediate Worſhip and Service, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, on this Occaſion, from the Example of the holy Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt before us, to engage your Love to it and Delight in it, that you may always be able to ſay as he does in my Text, <hi>LORD, I have loved the Habitation of thy Houſe, and the Place where thine Honour dwelleth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>David</hi> in this Pſalm pleads for an Intereſt in God's Favour and Protection, in Conſideration of his Sincerity and Integrity in the general Courſe of his Behaviour before him. <hi>Thy Lovingkindneſs,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is before mine Eyes and I have walked in thy Truth,</hi> v. 3. He declares his Abhorrence of evil Practices and evil Company, and his Reſolution to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005795_0004_1026F02F0E9F8BA8"/>
Innocence and Purity, in Order to render his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to GOD in divine Service acceptable to him, ver. 6. <hi>I will waſh my Hands in Innocency, ſo will I compaſs thine Altar, O LORD.</hi> On this Occaſion he profeſſes and declares in my Text, his great Love to the Houſe and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip of GOD; <hi>LORD,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I have loved the Habitation of thy Houſe, and the Place where thine Honour dwelleth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Houſe of GOD, we are to underſtand the Place ſet apart from worldly Uſes for the Worſhip and Service of GOD: and he calls it <hi>the Place where his Honour dwelleth,</hi> becauſe it is the Place where he vouchſafes his peculiar Preſence, and where we meet together to do Honour to him; to worſhip and adore him.—And when he tells us, how much he loved the Houſe of GOD, his Meaning is, not that he loved it for its own Sake, but for GOD's Sake, and upon Account of the Worſhip and Service that is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed to the Honour of GOD in it; or, which is the ſame Thing, that he loved and delighted in the public Worſhip of GOD.—What I propoſe therefore, is, as I ſaid, to explain and inforce the <hi>Great Duty of Loving and Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the public Worſhip of GOD.</hi> In doing which,</p>
            <p>I. I ſhall give a general Account of the Nature of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and particularly of the public Worſhip of GOD.</p>
            <p>II. I ſhall conſider what is implied in our Love to the public Worſhip, the genuine Tokens and Effects of it.</p>
            <p>III. I ſhall ſet before you the Reaſons and Motives on the Account of which we ought to love and delight in it.</p>
            <p>I. I am to give you a general Account of the Nature of Worſhip, and particularly, of the publick Worſhip of GOD. And in order to this, Worſhip muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered both as it is an Act of the <hi>Mind,</hi> and as it is an Act of the <hi>whole Man.</hi>—As it is an Act of the Mind, it implies, a deep and habitual Senſe of GOD, and of all his adorable Attributes and Perfections, and of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005795_0005_1026F030B0A59148"/>
to him, and Dependance upon him, and that we do accordingly from our Hearts give him the Glory of all that we are and enjoy: And conſequently, it muſt imply a deep Senſe of our Need of his Inſtruction and Aſſiſtance, and of his Favour and Bleſſing both for Soul and Body, and our earneſt Application to him therefor, with a hearty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Dedication of our ſelves and all our Powers and Faculties to his true and faithful Service.—This is Worſhip as it conſiſts in the Exerciſe of the Mind.—But, as GOD has given us the Organs and Faculties of the Body where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to expreſs and teſtify the inward Senſe and Exertions of the Mind, it is fit in it ſelf, and therefore he requires, that our whole Man be employed in his Worſhip and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;—that we <hi>glorify him</hi> with our <hi>Mouths</hi> as well as <hi>our Minds;</hi> with <hi>our Bodies</hi> as well as <hi>our Spirits,</hi> which are both equally <hi>his,</hi> being both alike created and redeemed by him.—It is therefore our Duty to teſtify the inward Senſe and Devotion of our Souls by the outward Language and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment of our Bodies; by ſuch a Language, ſuch Geſtures and Deportment of the Body as are moſt expreſſive of the deepeſt Humility, Reverence and Devotion of our Souls.—For, ſince we are ſenſitive as well as rational Creatures, and are apt to be wro't upon by ſenſible Objects, it is fit that we make Uſe of ſome ſenſible Means wherewith the better to exert and affect our Minds.—But we muſt always remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that as our Minds do properly conſtitute our rational Character as being what we really are, ſo our Hearts muſt ever correſpond with theſe outward Profeſſions and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, otherwiſe we may more truly be ſaid to mock God than adore him, and our Performances can be of no Account at all with him: for the <hi>Sacrifice of the Wicked is an Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the LORD,</hi> but it is <hi>the Prayer of the Upright</hi> that is <hi>his Delight.</hi> Prov. 15. 9.</p>
            <p>It is moreover neceſſary to conſider Worſhip both as it is a <hi>ſingle</hi> and as it is a <hi>ſocial</hi> Act.—Every <hi>particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> has particular Sins of his own to confeſs and repent of, and both needs and receives many particular Bleſſings and Favours peculiar to himſelf, for which he ought in all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon daily to pray to GOD, and to give him the Glory of them: And it is neceſſary in the Nature of the Thing that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005795_0006_1026F033519C0A98"/>
Religion be every Man's own perſonal Act and Deed even in ſocial Worſhip; for theſe Reaſons our bleſſed Saviour enjoins it upon all his Diſciples as an indiſpenſible Duty, That each Perſon by himſelf, <hi>enter into his Cloſet, and ſhut too the Door, and pray to his Father in ſecret, that his Father who ſeeth in ſecret, may reward him openly.</hi> Mat. 6. 4.</p>
            <p>But, as we are made for Society, and are a ſocial Syſtem of Creatures ſenſible to each other, and are moſt apt to be engaged <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and affected with what we do in Society and Fellowſhip one with another:—As we have all the ſame common Enjoyments and common Neceſſities both tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and ſpiritual; and what we do in common enjoy, does in all Reaſon demand a common Tribute of Praiſe, and what we all equally ſtand in Need of, it is fit we ſhould jointly and together make our Addreſſes to God for:—As this is our moſt <hi>reaſonable Service</hi> in it ſelf, and nothing is more beautiful, fit and amiable than that a Syſtem of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures ſhould join together with one Heart and Voice in doing the moſt reaſonable Thing in the World, by which their Hearts would be the more effectually unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and knit together in promoting all the Advantages of the ſocial Life;—on theſe and the like Accounts GOD does more eſpecially require and inſiſt upon ſocial Religion as our moſt indiſpenſible and bounden Duty, both in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and Common Wealths.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Families</hi> may be called natural Societies as depending on the Courſe of Nature, and founded in that natural Affection which ſubſiſts among Relatives;—and as theſe are the Foundation of all other Societies, and conſequently the good or ill State of other Communities which are made up of theſe, does chiefly depend upon the good or ill Habits that we contract in theſe original Seminaries of Society;—And as the public Weal of any Communities does in a great Meaſure depend upon a deep Senſe of GOD and Religion; it is therefore neceſſary that this be acquired and cultivated in our Souls from our very Infancy by the conſtant and regular Exerciſe of Family-Religion.—Hence it is the Character GOD gives with ſpecial Commendation of <hi>Abraham</hi> the <hi>Father of the Faithful,</hi> that he would <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

his Houſe and his Children after him to keep the Way of the Lord.</hi> Gen. 18. 10. And it was the pious Reſolution of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> Chap. 24. 15. <hi>As for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> And in <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 25. God threatens to pour out his Fury <hi>upon the People that know not him, and upon the Families that call not upon his Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Civil Governments</hi> or <hi>Common Wealths</hi> are political Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties founded in Compact to promote the general Good of the whole.—Now, as the general Good of every Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the whole depends upon the uniform Practice of every Virtue, Temperance, Meekneſs, and Humility, Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, Truth, Faithfulneſs and Integrity, Charity, Mercy, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Benevolence, and Obedience to Authority, and where the contrary Vices reign, there muſt neceſſarily be an utter Diſſolution of all that is amiable and comfortable in Society: As it is neceſſary, that theſe and the like Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues be founded and rooted in the Heart in Order that they be habitually and ſteadily exerted in the Life and Behaviour:—And as here is nothing can tend ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to operate upon the Hearts and inward Sentiments of the Souls of Men as a deep Senſe of the all-ſeeing and Heart-ſearching Eye of a moſt pure and holy, a moſt kind, true and juſt GOD, ever preſent with us and to whom we are accountable for all our Behaviour:—And laſtly, as this Senſe of GOD is beſt cultivated by a conſtant and public Exerciſe of Religion in the devout Worſhip and Adoration of this glorious Being on whoſe Providence all human Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs do inceſſantly depend; it is hence manifeſt that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever would in the beſt Manner conſult the general Good and public Weal of Mankind, whether in larger or ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Communities and Combinations, muſt maintain and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the public Exerciſe of Religion, and the devout Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Almighty GOD.</p>
            <p>And accordingly, as this ſeems to have been as it were engraven upon the Hearts of all Mankind of every Age and Nation, inſomuch that there never have been any Communities of Men who have not cultivated ſome Sort of public Religion and Worſhip; ſo it is remarkable in the Hiſtory of all Nations, even thoſe who have not had

the true Worſhip of GOD among them, and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of his peculiar People, to whom he has preſcribed the right Method of his public Worſhip, (and whom he has appointed and ſet up <hi>as a City upon an Hill</hi> to hold forth Light and to be Examples to the reſt of the World) that they have ever fared well or ill; have ever met with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous or adverſe Fortune, have ever been treated with Bleſſings or Curſes from Almighty GOD, according as they have been more or leſs religious and virtuous, and have been more or leſs zealous and regardful of his public Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.—So that it is a Matter of the greateſt Importance, eſpecially to us Chriſtians, who are infallibly taught by Revelation from Heaven, the right Method of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing GOD, ſo as to obtain his Favour and Acceptance through the Mediation of his dear Son, and by the Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his Holy Spirit, that we rightly underſtand the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the public Worſhip, and the Obligations we are under to a conſtant and regular Attendance upon it.—Let us therefore be a little particular upon this great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Subject.</p>
            <p>In public Worſhip we meet together into one Place, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred to Almighty GOD, as being devoted or ſet apart to the ſole Purpoſe of doing open and public Honour to him who is the great Maker, Preſerver and Governor of the World.—We there acknowledge ourſelves to be his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; to be made, preſerved, maintained and redeemed by him, and give him the Glory of all that we have and are, of all our Enjoyments, and all our Hopes in Time and to all Eternity: We addreſs our ſelves to him for all that we want both for Soul and Body, and receive his Inſtructions and devote our ſelves to be governed by them in Heart and Life.—So that public Worſhip conſiſts in theſe four Acts; in jointly praiſing GOD, and praying to him, and in receiving his Inſtructions, and devoting our ſelves to his Service.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>firſt</hi> Article of public Worſhip conſiſts in <hi>joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly praiſing GOD.</hi> Now to praiſe GOD is to acknowledge him to be what he is, to recognize his glorious Attributes and Operations, and to acknowledge our ſelves to be what
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005795_0009_1026F03B124064D0"/>
we are, his Creatures and Dependants, and to give him the Glory of all that we derive from him.—So that in praiſing GOD we devoutly confeſs and adore him as a Being of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Perfection, eternal and unchangeable: We admire his all-comprehending Knowledge, his aſtoniſhing Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, his boundleſs Power, and his unlimited and never-failing Goodneſs, which are ſurprizingly diſplayed in all his Works of Nature, Providence and Grace: We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be the Almighty Creator, the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Preſerver and ſupreme Governor of all Things in Heaven and Earth, and declare our ſincereſt Love and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and our profoundeſt Submiſſion and Reverence for the unſpeakable Goodneſs, Kindneſs, Juſtice, Truth and Faithfulneſs of all his wiſe and holy Adminiſtrations, in the Government of the World, and our utmoſt Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Deteſtation of every Thing inconſiſtent with the infinite Perfections of his Nature and the expreſs Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Will. We acknowledge that all that we are and enjoy, we have received from him, and hold intirely at his Mercy; that it is <hi>He that hath made us, and not we our ſelves, we are his People and the Sheep of his Paſture.</hi> (Pſal. 100. 3.) <hi>That he upholdeth our Souls in Life,</hi> and daily <hi>ſatisfieth our Mouth with good Things, and reneweth our Youth as the Eagles: That he forgiveth all our Iniquities, and healeth all our Diſeaſes: He redeemeth our Life from Deſtruction, and crowneth us with his Lovingkindneſs and tender Mercies.</hi> (Pſal. 103. 3, 4, 5.) And that it is he that <hi>giveth us Rain from Heaven and fruitful Seaſons, filling our Hearts with Food and Gladneſs, and beſtoweth upon us all Things richly to enjoy.</hi> (Acts 14. 17. and 1 Tim. 6. 17.) We do moreover moſt gratefully acknowledge, that when we had by Rebellion and wicked Works apoſtatized from him, and caſt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of his Favour, he did, in tender Compaſſion to our Souls, ſend his only Son to redeem us, and his Holy Spirit to ſanctify us, that we might be recovered again to his Service, and be reinſtated in his Favour and Friendſhip.—I ſay we acknowledge GOD to be the ſole Author of all theſe Favours and Bleſſings, and aſcribe the Glory of all to him, ſaying, <hi>Not unto us, not unto us, O LORD, but unto thy Name be the Glory, both for thy Truth, and for thy Mercy's Sake.</hi> Pſal. 115. 1. In ſuch Acknowledgments as
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005795_0010_1026F03CDCC41708"/>
theſe it is, that we perform the great Duty of praiſing GOD, which is the firſt Act of Worſhip: For which Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Church of GOD, and our excellent Church in particular, hath always made Uſe of the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> and other devout Hymns, chiefly taken out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as being in the beſt Manner expreſſive of theſe great Subjects of Adoration, Praiſe and Thankſgiving.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>next</hi> is <hi>public Prayer.</hi> By which, having praiſed GOD for all we enjoy, we make our Addreſſes to him for whatſoever we want, both for our Souls and Bodies, for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others. Our firſt and chief Concern muſt be for our Souls, that we may obtain thoſe ſpiritual Bleſſings without which we muſt be unavoidably miſerable: And theſe are, The Pardon of our Sins, and the Favour and Acceptance of GOD, the Aſſiſtance and Guidance of his Holy Spirit here, and eternal Happineſs in the Life to come.—Sin is the moſt pernicious of all Evils; it is the moſt fatal Bane of our rational and immortal Natures; for while we continue under the Power and Guilt of it, it is, in the Nature of Things, utterly impoſſible but that we muſt be miſerable. The firſt Thing, therefore, that it concerns us to be ſolicitous, and to pray for, is, that we may be delivered from the Power and Guilt of Sin. In Order to this, it is neceſſary that we begin our Addreſſes to GOD, (as our Church does) with a moſt ſerious Act of Repentance, which is the ſole and indiſpenſible Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pardon, and neceſſary in Order to render all our ſubſequent Acts of Prayer and Praiſe acceptable to him. This implies, that we do ſincerely confeſs our Sins unto GOD and bewail all our Rebellions againſt him, and this with the loweſt Proſtration of Soul and unfeigned Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heart, and full Purpoſe and Reſolutions of Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Life, as being the Qualifications abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to render us fit to receive the Bleſſings we ask for at his Hands.—We then implore his Pardon and Mercy, and intreat his gracious Acceptance of our Repentance, and an Intereſt in his Favour through the Mediation and interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his dear Son.—And as we do thus confeſs our Sins and beg his Pardon, ſo we do earneſtly apply our ſelves to him for the Grace of his Holy Spirit to enlighten our
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005795_0011_1026F03FE2DAD230"/>
Souls, to renew our Hearts and to ſtrengthen our Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that we may be able to withſtand the Power of Sin and all Temptations to it, and to aſſiſt us in the Exerciſe of all thoſe Graces and Virtues which are neceſſary to perfect our Natures, to conform us to his Image and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us pleaſing and acceptable in his Sight through the Merits and Mediation of our bleſſed Redeemer: In a Word, to fix and determine the whole Biaſs and Temper of our Souls to a ſincere Union with his Will, and to enable us to perſevere in his Service, in Spite of all the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh, faithful to the End of our Days, that we may be qualified for, and at Length admitted to the Enjoyment of endleſs Felicity and Glory in the Life to come.—And beſides theſe neceſſary Bleſſings that we beg for our Souls, we alſo pray for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we need for the Support of our Bodies; for Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from whatſoever may be afflictive to us, and the Beſtowment of what he ſees needful and convenient for us; Peace, Health, Food and Raiment, &amp;c. but all with a humble Submiſſion to his Will, who knows what is beſt for us, infinitely better than we do our ſelves.—And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, We not only teſtify our Humility and Piety in praying for our ſelves, but alſo our Benevolence and Charity in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceeding for others; <hi>for Kings and all that are in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> both in Church and State, and for all that are in any kind of Affliction either of Body or Mind, and not only for our Friends, but even for our very Enemies.—Theſe are the ſeveral Acts of Prayer, which is the ſecond Part of our public Worſhip; for which Purpoſe our Church is happily provided with an excellent Liturgy judiciouſly collected out of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>third</hi> is, <hi>Receiving GOD's Inſtructions.</hi> For which Purpoſe he hath given us the Holy Scriptures, wherein he hath explained his Mind and Will to us, and taught us what he would have us believe, and how he would have us behave and conduct our ſelves in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our being truly happy. With Regard to each of which (beſides the great Principles and Laws of Nature which are therein clearly explained and inculcated) he hath made known to us ſundry Things of the greateſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005795_0012_1026F04241E50BE0"/>
for the reſtoring us from our State of Corruption and Degeneracy to his Image and Favour, which we could never have had the leaſt Imagination of, without a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and expreſs Revelation.—That therefore we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the divine Inſtructions with Regard to theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous Affairs, in Order to make us <hi>wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> the holy Oracles of GOD are publickly read and explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Churches, and the great Doctrines and Laws are opened and enforced upon us.—And our Devotion to GOD with Reſpect to theſe, conſiſts in hearing and attending to them with the utmoſt Reverence and Seriouſneſs; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them, <hi>not as the Words of Men,</hi> but as being what in Truth they are, the very <hi>Words of GOD;</hi> (1 Theſſ. 2. 13.) and in treaſuring them up in good and honeſt Hearts, and practiſing them in the whole Courſe of our Lives.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the <hi>laſt</hi> Place. The public Worſhip of GOD im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies in it our <hi>devoting our ſelves to his Service,</hi> by whom, and for whom we were made and redeemed.—And tho' this be the Language and Intent of every Act of Worſhip, yet CHRIST hath appointed one holy Ordinance in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular for this Purpoſe, I mean the holy Sacrament of the LORD's Supper: Whereby (having ſolemnly entered into Covenant with GOD by Baptiſm, wherein we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted our ſelves, or been devoted, by our Friends to his Service) we do from Time to Time, refreſh upon our Minds a lively Senſe of the dying Love of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and in Conſideration thereof do renew our Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Reſolutions to live unto him who died for us and aroſe again. And as GOD does therein, on his Part, make over to us all thoſe ſpiritual Bleſſings of the New Covenant which CHRIST hath purchaſed for us by his Blood, ſo we, on our Part, as a neceſſary Condition of our being intereſted in them, do ſeriouſly make over, or give up and devote our ſelves to his true and faithful Service in the Performance of all the Duties he requires of us, in Order to our everlaſting Happineſs. And as we thus conſider this Ordinance as a ſolemn Act of Devotion, we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore receive it in a Poſture of Adoration.—Theſe are the ſeveral Parts of public Worſhip, which, as we are Men,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005795_0013_1026F044979C9610"/>
but eſpecially as we are Chriſtians, we are bound to love and delight in with all our Hearts:—And I am in the</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Second</hi> Place, to ſhew you what is implied in our Love to it.—And as to this, we know, Love is that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Soul whereby we delight in any Thing, and take Pleaſure in all Opportunities for the Enjoyment of it; and conſequently feel our ſelves very uneaſy if we are deprived of it.—Now therefore to apply this general Notion of Love to the Subject we are upon:—Our Love to the public Worſhip muſt imply theſe Things in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we love the public Worſhip of GOD, we ſhall be ſo far from thinking it a Burthen, that it will be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Uneaſineſs to us to be deprived of the Opportunities of attending upon it. We ſhall not be of the Humour of thoſe in the Prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> Ch. 1. Ver. 3. Who ſay, <hi>What Profit is there in ſerving the LORD, and behold what a Wearineſs is it? And when will the Sabbath be ended, that we may buy and ſell and get Gain?</hi>—This is the Language rather of an Atheiſt than a Chriſtian, and favours of a Soul alienated from GOD, immerſed in Fleſh and Senſe, and deſtitute of the ſpiritual and truly rational and divine Life.—Can there be the leaſt Spark of the Love of GOD in our Hearts if we have no Taſte; no Reliſh for his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and take no Delight in his Service, and find it a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to wait upon him and pay our Duty to him?—On the other Hand, if we have any Love for the Houſe of GOD, when we are deprived of it, we ſhall think our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the like melancholly Situation with <hi>David</hi> in the Wilderneſs, and be apt to ſay with him. Pſal. 42. and 43. <hi>As the Hart panteth after the Water-Brooks, ſo panteth my Soul after thee, O GOD; my Soul thirſteth for GOD even for the living GOD; O when ſhall I come and appear before GOD? When ſhall I ſee thy Goings, my King and my GOD, in thy Sanctuary? O ſend forth thy Light and thy Truth, let them lead me, and bring me into thy holy Hill, and to thy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:005795_0014_1026F0464F9F6B90"/>
2. If we love the public Worſhip we ſhall delight in the Returns of the Times and Seaſons of it, and be far from ſuffering any ſlight Temptation to prevail upon us to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it. This was the Temper of the holy Perſon whoſe Example we are now recommending, Pſal. 122. 1. <hi>I was glad,</hi> ſays he, <hi>when they ſaid, Come let us go into the Houſe of the LORD, our Feet ſhall ſtand within thy Gates, O</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, whither <hi>the Tribes go up, the Tribes of the LORD unto the Teſtimony of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to give Thanks unto the Name of the LORD.</hi>—He ſeems to be in a Rapture at the Thoughts of that heavenly Exerciſe wherein he ſo much delighted, nay, ſeems as if he could be glad to be always in the Way of it, Pſal. 27. 4. <hi>One Thing have I deſired,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and that will I ſeek after, that I may dwell in the Houſe of the LORD all the Days of my Life, to behold the fair Beauty of the LORD, and to inquire in his Temple.</hi>—Now how contrary to this is the Temper of the Generality of us now a-days; how dull and lazy, how cold and indifferent with Regard to the public Worſhip? And how little and trifling a Matter will be ſufficient to excuſe many of us from attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it? A little Degree of bad Weather, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps only ſome probable Symptoms of it: A ſlight Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or perhaps only an idle dull Humour will be a ſufficient Temptation to us to neglect it.—How ought we to be aſhamed of ſuch a Spirit of Indifference to that which is our moſt <hi>reaſonable Service,</hi> and to be reſolutely engaged in the Reformation of it? For in vain do we pretend to any true Love to GOD or ſerious Care for our Souls everlaſting Weal, if a ſmall Excuſe will keep us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the public Worſhip, which is the chief Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony we can give of our Love to him, and as neceſſary to the Nouriſhment and Support of the ſpiritual Life of our Souls, as our daily Bread is to the animal Life of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.—As therefore, an utter Loſs of Appetite is a fatal Symptom with Regard to the Health and Life of the Body; ſo, not to <hi>hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs</hi> and the Means neceſſary for it, is a no leſs fatal Symptom with Regard to the Life and Health of the Soul.—So that a good Man who loves the public Worſhip (as we ought all to do) <hi>like his neceſſary Food,</hi> will ſtudiouſly take Care to prevent every Thing that may hinder his Attendance,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005795_0015_1026F049CA245040"/>
and will not only order his Affairs ſo as to attend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly himſelf, but will take his Family; his Children and Servants; all that poſſibly he can with him to the Houſe of GOD; it being, as I ſaid, his ſtedfaſt Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with good <hi>Joſhua, As for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the LORD.</hi> In a Word, I would adviſe every one when he finds himſelf tempted by any Excuſe to neglect the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Worſhip of GOD, as well as any other Duty, ſeriouſly to lay his Hand upon his Heart, and aſk himſelf this Queſtion, Whether he can in earneſt think that Excuſe, whatever it be, will be ſufficient to juſtify him in the great Day of Accounts? and let him conduct according to the Views the he may reaſonably ſuppoſe he will then have of it.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Here began the Afternoon Sermon.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A Man that truly loves the public Worſhip, will make the beſt Advantage he can of it for the Purpoſes for which it is appointed.—As he will come in good Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with a Heart duly prepared for a ſerious Attendance, that he may be preſent at the preparatory Office of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing and repenting of his Sins, and receiving GOD's Declaration of Pardon to all true Penitents; ſo he will take Care, as far as may be, to looſe nothing of it, will attend diligently to every Part of it, endeavouring to <hi>keep his Heart with all Diligence</hi> (Prov. 4. 23.) and be duly intent and engaged in the Exerciſe of all the Acts of Worſhip, making each of them his own Act and Deed; remembring the wiſe Man's Advice, <hi>Eccleſ. 5. 1. Keep thy Foot when thou goeſt to the Houſe of GOD, and be more ready to hear than to offer the Sacrifice of Fools.</hi>—He will endeavour to chaſtize and call back every wandering Thought, and to baniſh every vain and worldly Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: He will rouſe himſelf up and keep his Senſes and Underſtanding awake, and with the utmoſt Struggle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to chaſe away all Dulneſs and Liſtleſſneſs:—He will ſtrive to have devout and raiſed Affections at the Conſideration of the great, ſublime and noble Objects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which his Mind is employed, and to exert all the Powers of his Soul in the heavenly Exerciſe in which he
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005795_0016_1026F04C1F780BA8"/>
is engaged.—His Heart will aſcend up to GOD with earneſt Deſires at the offering up of every Petition, and be inſpired with ardent Devotion at every Act of Praiſe. It will be affected with the ſincereſt Grief, attended with truly pious Reſolutions on Occaſion of the Confeſſion of Sin, and renewing of Repentance, and with lively Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gratitude upon the Recollection of the ſeveral Inſtances of the divine Goodneſs:—It will ſuffer a ſtrong Impreſſion from the Inſtructions, Admonitions and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that are ſuggeſted, and from a deep Senſe of the dying Love of the bleſſed JESUS, be unfeignedly devoted for his Sake, to the faithful Service of Almighty GOD. In a Word, he will endeavour to conduct himſelf through all the Acts of public Worſhip, as in the Preſence and at the Service of that great and all-ſeeing GOD who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves every Motion of his Heart, and to whom he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for all his Behaviour.—And as his Buſineſs there is to worſhip GOD, he will not divert his Tho'ts to pay his Reſpects unto Men, but will employ them to the beſt Advantage he can in anſwering the Ends of his attending upon the public Worſhip, which are the improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perfecting his rational and immortal Nature in all thoſe Qualifications and Accompliſhments that are eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally neceſſary to its everlaſting Happineſs.—According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he applies himſelf with the utmoſt Diligence in the Uſe of all the public Adminiſtrations of Religion, to raiſe his Soul to a truly divine and heavenly Temper, to increaſe in his Mind a deep and devout Senſe of GOD, to mortify and ſubdue all vicious Habits and perverſe Tempers, and to improve himſelf in all Kinds of Virtue and Holineſs, that he may be qualified for and intitled to an everlaſting Intereſt in the Favour and Acceptance of Almighty GOD. Theſe are the Ends he ſincerely aims at: And for that Reaſon he will not, when Service is over, go into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and Diverſion which will diſengage his Thoughts and Heart from what he has heard, and wipe out the good Impreſſions he has received: But he retires home and keeps out of the World that he may cheriſh and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them by private Reading, Meditation and Devotion, and take Care of his Family, his Children and Servants,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005795_0017_1026F04E892195E0"/>
that the Seeds of true Religion may be early ſown in their Hearts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> He that thus loves the public Worſhip of GOD, will chearfully and liberally contribute, according to the utmoſt of his Ability to maintain and provide hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourably for it; whether it be for building or repairing Houſes for the public Worſhip, or for providing Utenſils for it, or for ſupporting the Miniſters of Religion, &amp;c. as knowing that, ſince it is GOD that <hi>gives him all Things richly to enjoy,</hi> it is but his <hi>reaſonable Service</hi> and bounden Duty, that he ſhould, in Teſtimony of his Gratitude to his great Benefactor, and for ſecuring his Bleſſing for the future upon all that he hath, be always ready to <hi>honour the LORD with his Subſtance.</hi> (Prov. 3. 9.) And he that finds himſelf of a reluctant, narrow and contracted Spirit when any good Opportunity offers for doing Honour to GOD this <hi>Way,</hi> has but too much Reaſon to conclude that he <hi>loves the World</hi> and himſelf more than GOD, and conſequently that <hi>the Love of the Father is not in him.</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 15. And if this be the Caſe, his Soul is in a very miſerable Situation indeed.—Theſe and the like, are the genuine Exerciſes and Fruits, and conſequently the true Evidences of this excellent Temper I am recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <abbr>viz.</abbr> A ſincere Love to the public Worſhip of GOD. Let us therefore, my Brethren, earneſtly endeavour to find them in us, and by no Means content our ſelves without them: For if we are deſtitute of them we are void of the true Temper and Spirit of Chriſtianity. And to move us the more ſtrongly hereunto, let us,</p>
            <p>III. In the <hi>third</hi> Place, ſet before our ſelves the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Motives, on the Account of which, we ought to love and delight in the public Worſhip. And to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe let it be conſidered, that it is a Duty moſt reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,—moſt amiable,—vaſtly advantageous,—expreſly commanded,—and was accordingly ever practiſed by all good and holy Communities both of Men and Angels.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is moſt reaſonable in it ſelf that we do publickly and jointly worſhip and adore Almighty GOD.—For
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005795_0018_1026F050EE73CCC8"/>
this is the firſt and moſt important Principle of Reaſon, that we ſhould think and act with Regard to every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; every Perſon and Thing, as being what it really is. Since therefore GOD the great Object of our Worſhip, is that glorious Being who made, preſerves and governs the World and every Creature therein, nothing can be more fit and reaſonable than that we do acknowledge and adore him as ſuch. And ſince we derived our Being from him, and do, by the Neceſſity of our Nature depend upon him every Moment, for the Continuance of it and all the Means neceſſary for the Support of it; and do, on theſe Accounts, ſtand in a moſt near and unalterable Relation to him as his Creatures and Dependents; ſince we are made after his Image, being by him endowed with rational Powers and Faculties, whereby we are capable of underſtanding in what Relation we ſtand towards him, of being ſenſible of our abſolute Dependence upon him and innumerable Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to his infinite Goodneſs, and of being affected and conducting in ſome Meaſure towards him accordingly;—and, ſince, when we had deſtroyed our ſelves by our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt him, he was graciouſly pleaſed, of his meer Mercy, to ſend his bleſſed Son, and holy Spirit to recover us and bring us back to our Duty and his Favour; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered from the greateſt Miſery, we might be put into a Capacity for the Enjoyment of the greateſt Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:—I ſay, the Caſe being really thus, nothing can be more fit and reaſonable than that we ſhould, not only be deeply and moſt gratefully ſenſible of all theſe Things, but likewiſe frequently expreſs this Senſe of our Minds, by our grateful Acknowledgments for all that we have and are, and by ſeriouſly addreſſing our ſelves to him for whatſoever we want, and by living and behaving ourſelves as it becomes ſuch a Condition and Apprehenſion of Things: Otherwiſe we do not act like Men endowed with Reaſon and Conſideration, but rather like irrational and unthinking Beaſts.—And laſtly, Inaſmuch as we all in common partake of theſe Benefits and Advantages of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Preſervation and the Enjoyment of our ſelves and every Thing about us, and all equally <hi>live, move and have our Being in him,</hi> and not only all partake in common of the conſtant Fruits of his fatherly Care and his moſt kind
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005795_0019_1026F053A91A2BC8"/>
and watchful Providence, but are all equally redeemed by the Blood of his dear Son, and conſequently all equally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied to him as our common Father, and to one another as Brethren: there is therefore all the Reaſon in the World that we ſhould jointly and in common meet together to pay our Duty and Acknowledgments to him, and give him the Glory of the common Bleſſings we enjoy, and apply to him for the Supply of our common Wants and Neceſſities. Thus you ſee that to attend conſtantly upon the public Worſhip of Almighty GOD, and there to <hi>preſent our Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy and acceptable to him, is our moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Service,</hi> (Rom. 12. 1.) So that we ſhall act a moſt unreaſonable, unnatural and brutiſh Part if we neglect it.</p>

            <p n="2">2. As it is thus moſt reaſonable, ſo it is on the ſame Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts moſt amiable: For the <hi>Amiable</hi> in the Actions and Behaviour of reaſonable Creatures conſiſts in doing what is fit and right upon all Occaſions, and what will not fail to approve it ſelf as ſuch, to the Reaſon and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of every intelligent Being.—Hence, <hi>Whatſoever Things are lovely,</hi> in St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s Account, (Phil. 4. 8.) are the ſame with <hi>Whatſoever Things are true, juſt, honeſt, pure, and of good Report:</hi> Among which the public Worſhip of GOD muſt be undoubtedly reckoned, ſince it is founded in Reaſon and Truth, and in the Fitneſs and Nature of Things, and conſequently cannot fail of the Approbation and Eſteem of every one that is capable of conſidering Things as being what they really are. For it is what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults as a neceſſary Conſequence from our Relation as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Dependents to him as our great Creator and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor. And by a Conduct fit and ſutable to this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we do him the greateſt Honour we poſſibly can.—And by how much the greater Number there are that join together in the Performance of ſo fit, ſo right, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable a Service as this is, by ſo much the greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour we do to him who is our common Father, Preſerver, and Benefactor.—The Glory of a Prince is the Multitude of his obedient Subjects;—the Glory of a Maſter is the Number of his faithful Servants;—and the Glory of a Father is a numerous, dutiful, obſequious and grateful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005795_0020_1026F056C12C2008"/>
all chearfully owning their Dependance upon him; all thankfully paying their Duty, Homage and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments to him, and obediently conducting themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his Injunctions:—This is indeed a moſt amiable Sight.—In like Manner, what can be more amiable in itſelf, and what can more redound to the Honour and Glory of GOD our kind indulgent heavenly Father, our ſupreme Kind, Lord and Governor, than for a great Number of us, all deeply ſenſible of his All-ſufficiency and our Dependance, and the manifold Bleſſings we receive from him and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him for, to conſpire together, with one Heart and Voice, in a holy Strife, contending as it were, which of us ſhall do him the greateſt Honour, and endeavouring to out-vie each other in aſcribing to him the Praiſe and Glory of all the liberal and plentiful Proviſion he makes for us for our Well-being and Happineſs both in Time and to all Eternity; and not for us only, but for all his numerous Offspring, the <hi>whole Family of Heaven and Earth</hi> on whom, as a moſt tender Parent he is continually pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his innumerable Benefits?—This is indeed, a moſt graceful, a moſt beautiful and amiable Sight!—This is to <hi>worſhip the LORD in the Beauty of Holineſs!</hi>—And what is ſo amiable in it ſelf, ought certainly to attract the Love and engage the Delight of every reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For it <hi>is a good Thing to ſing Praiſes to our GOD, it is pleaſant, and Praiſe is comely; yea, a joyful and pleaſant Thing it is to be thankful.—It is a good Thing to give Thanks unto the LORD, and to ſing Praiſes to thy Name, O moſt High, to ſhew forth thy Lovingkindneſs in the Morning, and thy Faithfulneſs every Night.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> ſings, Pſ. 147. 1. and 92. 1.

3. It is not only moſt reaſonable and amiable, but it is moreover vaſtly for our own Good and Advantage to wait upon GOD in the holy Services of his Worſhip.—It cannot be denied, that whatſoever tends to raiſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our rational and immortal Nature and make it as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as it is capable of being, not only in Time but to the endleſs Ages of Eternity, is of the higheſt Advantage to us. Now it is manifeſt that the Knowledge, Love and Practice of whatſoever is fit and reaſonable in it ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail of perfecting our reaſonable Nature as ſuch, and conſequently muſt render it happy as long as it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues what it is; and ſince it endures for ever it muſt render it happy forever. Since therefore we have proved that Religion and the Worſhip of GOD is the moſt fit and reaſonable Thing in the World, it evidently follows, that this muſt tend in the directeſt Manner to our higheſt Perfection and Happineſs. Eſpecially, ſince the great Object of religious Worſhip and all the glorious Things that attend it, which <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor hath it entered into the Heart of Man to conceive,</hi> are coex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive in their Duration with that of our immortal Souls, and conſequently muſt be their proper Objects, and a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ceaſing Fund of Happineſs to them as long as Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it ſelf endures.—Accordingly, the devout Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Almighty GOD have always experienced that the frequent Practice of worſhipping and adoring him, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uring their Minds to the Contemplation of the glorious and ever enduring Objects of Religion, which are truly the nobleſt and ſublimeſt Objects, does abundantly tend to their greateſt Improvement and Perfection; that as theſe are the proper Objects of their Souls, ſo the more they converſe with them, the more they love them and the greater Reliſh they have for them. They find that it diſengages their Minds from the Love of baſe and ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Gratifications, delivers them from the Entanglements of carnal Appetites and low grovelling Pleaſures, purifies their Intentions, conforms them to GOD, and makes them <hi>Partakers of the divine Nature:</hi> And in a Word, that it is the Source and Nouriſhment of all thoſe heavenly Virtues that do immediately and in the Nature of the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves qualify them for, and give them a Foretaſte of the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005795_0022_1026F05A0C676270"/>
Glories and Felicities of the heavenly State.—In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this, they cannot fail of feeling inexpreſſible Calmneſs and Tranquillity of Mind, a <hi>Peace that paſſeth all Underſtanding,</hi> and a <hi>Joy unſpeakable, and full of Glory,</hi> while they have the comfortable Applauſes of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and the glorious Hopes and Expectations of a bleſſed Immortality.—This enables them to take the moſt ſolid Comfort in every Thing they enjoy in this World, and encourages them to confide in GOD's good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for his Bleſſing on all their Undertakings and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; for <hi>Godlineſs hath the Promiſe of the Life that now is, as well as that which is to come.</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 8.—So many and great Advantages is the devout worſhipping of GOD attended with!—How then can we fail of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in it, and pronouncing with the holy Pſalmiſt, Surely <hi>One Day ſpent in the Houſe of GOD is better than a Thouſand elſewhere. I had rather be a Door-Keeper in the Houſe of my GOD, than to dwell in the Tents of Wickedneſs: For the LORD GOD is a Sun and a Shield: He will give Grace and Glory, and no good Thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Pſal. 84.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It being thus reaſonable, amiable and advantageous, GOD does moreover, and for theſe Reaſons, expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and command us to worſhip him as our bounden Duty, and that not only ſingly but jointly.—<hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the LORD thy GOD, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> Matth. 4. 10. And <hi>the Father ſeeks ſuch to worſhip him as worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> ſays our bleſſed Saviour, Joh. 4. 23. And when the Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>Worſhip the LORD in the Beauty of Holineſs,</hi> (Pſal. 29. 2.) he means as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved above, in that amiable Manner which is implied in the joint Addreſs of a great Number, unanimouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring together in devoting themſelves to the faithful Service of Almighty GOD.—Accordingly we find that the primitive Chriſtians, (Acts 4. 24.) whoſe excellent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample we follow in our Church, <hi>Lift up their Voice with one Accord in the</hi> Worſhip of GOD: And St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires that we ſhould, <hi>with one Mind and one Mouth glorify GOD, even the Father of our LORD JESUS CHRIST.</hi>—Not that GOD requires us to worſhip him becauſe it is any
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005795_0023_1026F05D626CB2C8"/>
Advantage to him; for what Profit can <hi>it be to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty that we ſerve him?</hi> But it is meerly becauſe he knows it is for our own greateſt Good and Advantage, and that we do thereby purſue our higheſt Perfection and Happineſs.—We muſt not therefore imagine that GOD requires us to worſhip him for his own Sake, or that he ſeeks to add any Thing to his Happineſs from it: That he does it becauſe he takes Pleaſure in hearing himſelf applauded by us, or aims at gratifying his arbitrary Will and Pleaſure by exacting our Obedience: No, theſe are Ends infinitely beneath him who has a boundleſs All-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency within himſelf for his own Happineſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot poſſibly ſtand in Need of us or any of our Services: But he does it purely becauſe it is fit and right in it ſelf, and upon many Accounts uſeful and neceſſary for us to live under a conſtant and habitual Senſe of our abſolute Dependance upon him: And that nothing can ſo effectually tend to keep up a lively Senſe of this upon our Minds, which is the Foundation of all other Virtues, as to live in the daily Practice of attending upon his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: He does it becauſe he would have us happy, and he knows we cannot be happy without it. How much the greater Reaſon have we then to love and delight in his Service when we know that he requires it of us ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſtedly, and from ſo much Kindneſs and Good-Will towards us? But let us alſo remember that we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be ſo much the more ſeverely puniſhed for our Ingratitude and Perverſeneſs if we live in the Neglect of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And laſtly, To worſhip GOD, has accordingly been always the Practice of all good and holy Perſons and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities both of Men and Angels: They are ever repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as accounting it <hi>their Meat and their Drink,</hi> and what they <hi>preferred above their chiefeſt Joy.</hi> It would be endleſs for me to exemplify this in the particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that occur in Hiſtory whether ſacred or profane: The Holy Scriptures are full of them from the Beginning to the End: But there is ſcarce any Inſtance ſo remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as that of the holy Perſon whoſe Example we have now under our Conſideration, who beſides innumerable

other Expreſſions of his Love and Zeal for GOD's public Worſhip, tells us in Pſ. 69. 9. That <hi>the Zeal of GOD's Houſe had even eaten him up:</hi> Which Words are applied to CHRIST his great Antitype, by the Apoſtle in St. <hi>John</hi> 2. 17. when he expreſſed his Zeal for the Houſe of GOD by driving away the Money-Changers.

What then can be Matter of greater Love and Delight to us here, than to be of ſuch glorious Company, in ſuch noble Exerciſes, to hold Communion with all the heavenly Hoſts of GOD; to make that our Buſineſs and Delight now, which is to be our Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Happineſs forever?—What can be of ſo great Importance to us, if ever we hope to be happy with the bleſſed Company of pure and holy Spirits above, as to learn their bleſſed Trade and Buſineſs while we are here, by accuſtoming our ſelves to theſe holy and devout Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, wherein the Happineſs of Heaven it ſelf conſiſts, and by which we ſhall acquire that divine and heavenly Temper which will <hi>make us meet to be Partakers of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Saints in Light;</hi> that when our Time is out and we have done with this World, we may be ready to join with our heavenly Kindred above, and enter upon the Poſſeſſion of the inconceivable and everlaſting Glories of the heavenly State?</p>
            <p>Let us then, my Brethren, in Conſideration of all theſe weighty Reaſons and moſt engaging Motives, manifeſt our Sollicitude for the everlaſting Happineſs of our Souls and the Souls of our Children after us, by inuring both our ſelves and them to a devout and conſtant Attendance

            <p>For theſe bleſſed Purpoſes, Let this Houſe be hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward ſacred to Almighty GOD! And as it is built to the Honour of CHRIST, his bleſſed Son, the great Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of our holy Religion, Let it be called by the Name of CHRIST's CHURCH.</p>
            <p>And now, my Brethren, Let us all devoutly pray with the holy Pſalmiſt, in Pſalm 132. Ver 8. &amp;c. <hi>Ariſe, O LORD, into thy reſting Place, Thou and the Ark of thy Strength: Let thy Prieſts be clothed with Righteouſneſs, and thy Saints ſhout aloud for Joy: Let them always enter into thy Gates with Thankſgiving and into thy Courts with Praiſe:</hi> And <hi>let them ever be thankful to GOD and ſpeak Good of his Name: For the LORD is gracious, his Mercy is everlaſting, and his Truth endureth from Generation to Generation.—This is the Houſe of GOD, this is the Gate of Heaven.</hi>—May the good Spirit of GOD perpetually attend the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Houſe, and Succeſs attend the Means of Grace.—Particularly, May the Word of GOD which ſhall be delivered from this Place <hi>never return empty, but accompliſh the End for which it is ſent:</hi> May it ever <hi>take deep Root in all our Hearts, and bring forth Fruit abundantly in our
