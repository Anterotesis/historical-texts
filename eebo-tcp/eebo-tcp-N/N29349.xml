            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>NARRATIVE OF A VOYAGE FROM PHILADELPHIA TO ST. BARTHOLOMEWS.</head>
            <byline>BY WILLIAM WHELAND.</byline>
            <p>ON the 27th day of Auguſt, 1799, I ſet ſail from the port of Philadelphia, on board the ſchoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Eliza, bound for St. Thomas's: American ſeamen being at that time very hard to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I was under the neceſſity of ſhipping three fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners; ſo that my crew conſiſted of two Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, Thomas Croft, (whom I afterwards appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mate,) and Jacob Suſter, together with the three foreigners, who entered with me by the names of Joſeph Baker, Joſeph Brous and Peter Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The name of our ſupercargo was Charles Rey, a French gentleman, who had long reſided in the iſ]and of St. Domingo, and had borne the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of general in the armies of his Catholic ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, previous to the revolution; but, like many others of his unfortunate countrymen, was under the neceſſity of ſeeking an aſylum in America,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:039087_0003_1013997A5863F520"/>
when the Negroes had ſeized upon the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that iſland.</p>
            <p>In this country he married an amiable young lady, of Baltimore, of French extraction, with whom he lived in the moſt perfect ſtate of conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal felicity, and by whom he had one child. He occaſionally reſided at Philadelphia and Baltimore; in both of which places, he had endeared himſelf to a numerous circle of acquaintance, by the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his converſation and the ſuavity of his manners: his fortunes, however, began, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably impaired, by diſappointments in his remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances from St. Domingo, and other real loſſes to a great amount; he reſolved, therefore, to go out ſupercargo, with a view of regaining, if poſſible, ſome part of his immenſe property in the iſland, and to provide for a beloved wife and encreaſing family.</p>
            <p>Neither Mr. Rey nor myſelf had a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the three foreigners. They ſeemed to us to be men of an implacable and revengeful ſpirit; for, ſoon after we had ſailed, in going down the river, one of them, Peterſon, alias Louis Lacroix, having refuſed to obey the orders of the mate, I ſtruck him; on ſeeing this, Baker came to his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and Mr. Rey ſtepped forward to protect me; when I had given Baker a good beating, they both promiſed to do their duty like good men, if I would forgive them, which I immediately
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:039087_0004_101399BD0BA49F10"/>
promiſed to do; after which they behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for 14 days very well, and there was no more diſpute until the 12th of September, being in latitude 28, 30, N. and in longitude 60, 00, W. At about 10 o'clock, P. M. it being the mate's watch on deck, Mr. Rey and myſelf had gone to ſleep in our births, one on each ſide of the cabin. It appears that the three deſperadoes, Baker, Brous and Peterſon, availed themſelves of an opportunity, while the mate was a-ſleep on deck, to give him a blow on the head with an axe: but, as no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was on deck at that time, except the mate and the three ruffians, a circumſtantial account of the murder of the mate cannot be obtained. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, however, that he was murdered and thrown over-board. By their account afterwards to me, Brous is ſaid to have given him the firſt blow, and Baker, alias Boulanger, the ſecond, which finiſhed his exiſtence; but, by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in Philadelphia, before judge Peters, it is ſaid, that the mate and Brous, having ſome quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and Brous declaring himſelf the maſter of the veſſel, and the mate his priſoner of war, the mate ſtruck him, which cauſed Brous, alias Berouce, in his own defence, to lift up an axe, and give him a blow on the head: This was a bad plea of ſelf-defence, as the mate was obviouſly juſtified in ſtriking a man who acknowledged his intention of turning pirate, and taking the veſſel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:039087_0005_1013997BDD764C20"/>As ſoon as Thomas Croft, the mate, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, and while he lay lifeleſs on the deck, they entered the cabin, and, approaching the birth where I lay aſleep, one of them ſtruck me one blow over the head, and another over the arm, with an axe, and immediately I received a ſtab in the arm with a ſword. Upon which, I ſprung up, and ſeized my piſtols, which were under my head; at the ſame time, Charles Rey, awaking from his ſleep by the noiſe which this circumſtance occaſioned, jumped out of his birth, and cried out in French, what is the matter? And ſeeing that I was aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the three villains, by the blood on my face and arm, he ſnatched a piſtol ſuddenly from my hand, and turning upon them, they retreated from the cabin; but, in his attempt to follow them, he received a ſevere blow over the head with the pump brake, which laid him on the cabin floor; however, he ſoon recovered a little, but, as it was dark, neither of us durſt make a ſecond attempt to go up from the cabin, thro' fear of meeting with a ſimilar reception. No words can deſcribe the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of my ſituation for nearly half an hour: my wounds were extremely painful, and I was almoſt covered with blood, while Mr. Rey ſeemed a little delirious from the blow he had received on his head, and I expected every moment to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by the ruffians, and finally murdered.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:039087_0006_101399BF97944140"/>
We were in this ſituation, when Mr. Rey, ſeeing light on deck, ſprung up in a fit of deſperation to make a ſecond effort, when he received another mortal blow on the head.</p>
            <p>Thinking that my generous friend, Mr. Rey, was murdered, and ſeeing myſelf covered with blood, I wrenched the piſtol, with ſome difficulty, from his dying-graſp, and putting myſelf in a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of defence, I begged they would ſpare my life. Not knowing, at that moment, that the mate was murdered, I imagined the whole crew had riſen againſt me, until thoſe murderers informed me, that all, except myſelf, were killed,—bidding me come on deck, which I refuſed, as I was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive that if I did, I ſhould be immediately mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. They then ordered me to hand them up liquor, which I was incapable of doing, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the wounds which I had already received; nevertheleſs, as they ſaw me armed with piſtols, they were afraid of entering the cabin. A kind of parley then took place betwixt us, in which it was agreed, that I ſhould navigate the veſſel to the Spaniſh Main, on condition that they would ſpare my life. Under an aſſurance of ſparing their lives, they entered the cabin, ſupplied themſelves with liquor, and removed Mr. Rey upon deck: he was ſtill in life; but it was impoſſible, even with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical aid, that he could have recovered. He
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:039087_0007_1013997E64674A48"/>
appeared inſenſible to every thing that was going forward after his laſt fatal wound. Theſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, eager to finiſh the diabolical work they had begun, haſtened to throw him over-board, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there was evident ſigns of life. But theſe wretches were not yet ſatiated with blood. Jacob Suſter, the remaining ſeaman, who had not joined in the conſpiracy, and who had been aſleep in the fore-caſtle during this ſcene of horror, was now called aft, under a pretence that I wanted him; but, no ſooner had he advanced within reach of theſe wretches, than he was knocked down with an axe, and immediately thrown into the ſea. At that time we had light winds, and the veſſel was making very little way, ſo that I could diſtinctly hear his groans for at leaſt eight or ten minutes.</p>
            <p>Jacob Suſter was not known to me previous to his entering on board the ſchooner; but, from his ſhipment to the hour of his death, his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was that of a good and faithful ſeaman. He was born in Germantown, in the ſtate of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, where his parents, I am informed, now reſide.</p>
            <p>When theſe villains had finiſhed their work of murder, and conſcious of their own incapacity to navigate the veſſel, they came into the cabin, and dreſſed my wounds: they then proceeded to waſh off the blood from the floor of the cabin and from
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:039087_0008_101399C128A59FD8"/>
the deck, which, when they had finiſhed, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, as ſoon as morning appeared, to pillage the property of the deceaſed.</p>
            <p>When day-light appeared, and perceiving that they conſidered their own ſafety to depend upon my knowledge of navigation, I began to have ſome hopes that my life would be ſpared, and even that the veſſel might be regained; but, tho' I found my piſtols ſerviceable to me in keeping them off, I was apprehenſive, that, in caſe of another conflict, they might be uſed againſt myſelf; I, therefore, threw my piſtols overboard ſecretly,—a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which they never found out; for they always underſtood that I had them in my poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>In this ſituation, in mutual fear of each other, we proceeded as they ſuppoſed towards the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Main, but in this I deceived them, by telling them that a ſtrong current ſet in to the weſtward, and that we muſt keep a more eaſterly courſe, which we did, but without diſcovering a ſail. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this time, though the weather was generally moderate, the ſails and rigging not being well trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, received conſiderable damage; for, I was not capable of handling a rope myſelf, and they were not under my ſubjection or orders; beſides, when my arm, which I had conſtantly kept in a ſling, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to grow better, I endeavoured to conceal it as much as poſſible from them, thinking that my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:039087_0009_1013997FEB8547F8"/>
conſiſted, in a great meaſure, on their ideas of my weakneſs. In the mean while, their principal occupation was in rifling the veſſel, breaking open packages, in ſearch of any thing valuable, or for barrels of hams or other proviſions; whilſt I was on the watch for an opportunity to overcome them, and get poſſeſſion of the veſſel.</p>
            <p>This opportunity preſented on the 21ſt Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, on the ninth day after the murderers had got poſſeſſion of the veſſel. Two of them, Peterſon, alias La Croix, and Baker, alias Boulanger, went down the fore-ſcuttle to bring up ſome hams, while Brous was ſtooping down to make a fire in the cabcuſh; I immediately ſeized a club that lay near me, with my left hand, my right being ſtill in a ſling, and gave Brous, a ſevere blow on the back of the head, which laid him flat on the deck; I attempted a ſecond blow, but miſſed him. Mr. Rey's bull-dog ſeeing me engaged, flew, bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my aſſiſtance, which ſo much deterred Brous from turning upon me, that he run aft, and got up the ſhrouds; I immediately ſnatched up an axe, and ran to the fore-ſcuttle, ſlipping my arm from the ſling, and forgetting my wounds, lifted up the axe, as in act to ſtrike the two that were there, and whoſe heads were then above the deck, attempting to come out; but the moment they ſaw the axe over their heads, they ſunk down into the hold, and I
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:039087_0010_101399C4A79B2900"/>
inſtantly ſhut the ſkuttle over them; and, to make it more ſecure, I dragged a ſmall anchor from the bow, by means of a rope round the windlaſs, and laid it over the ſkuttle.</p>
            <p>Having now Peterſon and Baker ſecured, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to Brous, who was on the ſhrouds; at firſt he had no intention of yielding, but cried out to his companions that they might come aft into the cabin, and proceed that way to his aſſiſtance, while thoſe below were vociferating loudly to him; but, being in French, I did not perfectly underſtand.</p>
            <p>But, when Brous ſaw himſelf entirely at my mercy, he ſupplicated with great earneſtneſs, that I would ſpare his life, which I promiſed to do, on condition that he would come down and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf to be confined, and behave in every reſpect as I directed him. He was ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could be perſuaded to believe that I would ſpare him: However, on my further aſſurances, he was prevailed on to come down; as ſoon as he was on deck, he fell on his knees, took me by the hand, and kiſſed it ſeveral times, making, at the ſame time, the moſt ſolemn proteſtations of ſubmiſſion. I then ordered him to put his hands behind him, that I might tie them, which he inſtantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with; I then got a chain, and chained him upon deck to the ring-bolts. Brous being thus ſecured, I ſet about taking the neceſſary precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:039087_0011_10139982954BEB68"/>
for preſerving what I had gained; I, therefore, went into the cabin, and brought up biſcuit and other proviſions, together with my quadrant, books, &amp;c. and ſecured the cabin, leſt they might force a paſſage that way.</p>
            <p>I now ſaw that I had an arduous taſk to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh, to navigate a ſchooner alone, and to watch my priſoners; from whom (if they had accompliſhed their intents) I could expect no mercy; but, when I compared it with what I had already ſuffered, it appeared a pleaſure. The moſt difficult part I thought was over, and that I had only to ſuffer ſome privations, to truſt to the protection of the Almighty, and my own vigilance. When I regained poſſeſſion of the ſchooner, I found myſelf in latitude 25 deg. North, and in longitude 60 deg. Weſt. My priſoners below had plenty of proviſions; but they were in darkneſs, and had no water. To prevent them making any attempts to regain their liberty, I did not think it proper to drive them to deſperation; but to ſhow them that I was willing to let them live, and enjoy as many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts as was conſiſtent with my own ſafety: I burnt a hole with a ſpike, in the fore-ſcuttle, through which I could pour water and other refreſhments; ſo that, after ſeveral attempts to break through, and believing that I had killed Brous, and thrown him overboard, they deſiſted, and ſeemed to ſubmit to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:039087_0012_101399C72690C5B0"/>
their fate. As for Brous, who was on deck, I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him, at meal times, to have the partial uſe of his limbs, to change his poſition, &amp;c. but I would by no means ſuffer him to ſpeak aloud, or be for a moment totally unfettered; for, my greateſt fears were from his getting looſe, and ſuddenly ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, while I was in a ſlumber; for, I never lay down, or had any profound ſleep while they were under my charge.</p>
            <p>On the 4th of October, being thirteen days after the recapture of the veſſel, Providence dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that time having bleſſed me with favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able weather, except one gale, which laſted twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four hours, I diſcovered the iſland of St. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew's, and at 7, P. M. was off the harbour; and, by the aſſiſtance of a Swediſh ſchooner, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored to the leeward of the harbour, and at 10, P. M. John Peterſon, Eſq. commander of his Swediſh majeſty's brig Houſare, ſent his barge, with two officers and ten men, to my aſſiſtance, in which he was joined by A. Campbell, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the United States brig Eagle, and, on the 5th inſtant, anchored ſafe in port; and after being moored, I landed, and entered a proteſt againſt the priſoners, for murder and piracy, with Job Wall, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> conſul for the United States of America, who had the murderers put in irons, on board of the aforeſaid United States brig Eagle,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:039087_0013_1013998662E7E9C0"/>
with orders to be delivered up to Thomas Tingey, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> commander of the United States ſhip Ganges, and commodore of the leeward ſtation.</p>
            <p>After delivering up my priſoners to captain Campbell, I was politely treated by the merchants and other inhabitants of the iſland; but, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment made a claim of ſalvage, for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance the Swediſh brig had given me, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the veſſel to her anchorage. However, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the claim thus ſet up, and ſhowed that it was contrary to the treaty with Sweden; but was obliged to pay two hundred dollars to the ſailors of the Swediſh brig for their aſſiſtance. Soon after I ſold my cargo, and purchaſed another of ſugars, and having hired freſh hands, I ſailed from St. Bartholomew's on the 4th November, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Glouceſter-Point the 25th of the ſame month.</p>
            <p>When the priſoners were brought to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, they underwent an examination before judge Peters, in which they confeſſed the piracy and murder, differing very little in the detail of the circumſtances from the foregoing narrative: The plea which they ſet up in their defence was, that they were French priſoners, and in the ſervice of the French Republic: That one of them, Brous, alias La Roche, bore a commiſſion under that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and therefore they had a right to make
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:039087_0014_101399C8ADB4E998"/>
prize of an American veſſel, and to kill any perſon that reſiſted the attempt. But, the judge having conſidered that they entered voluntarily into the American ſervice, objected to their plea, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them to priſon for trial. Peterſon, alias La Croix, has not the leaſt appearance of being a Frenchman, though he ſpeaks bad French, having been probably on board a French ſhip, and it is more likely that he is a Dane or a Swede. As for Boulanger, alias Baker, we have good authority to ſay, that he is a Canadian, that he was born at Les-trois-riviers, of a creditable family, and was a ſoldier in a regiment called the Royal Canadians, in the ſervice of his Britannic majeſty, from which he deſerted in the ſpring of 1799, and came into New-York ſtate, by the way of Lake Champlain; ſo that it is not probable that he was ever in the ſervice of France, or at ſea before this fatal voyage. And it is highly probable that Brous, alias La Roche, is alſo a Canadian.</p>
            <p>Their trial came on in the circuit court of the United States, before judges Chaſe and Peters, on Monday, the 21ſt April; they having for council, Meſſrs. Dallas, Moylan and Duponceau; the only evidence againſt them was myſelf, and their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened conduct; and judge Peters, who was called upon to give the ſubſtance of their examination
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:039087_0015_10139987EA0700B0"/>
before him, previous to their commitment for trial, the jury, after retiring a ſhort time, brought in a verdict of GUILTY.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sentences of Death was paſſed upon them on Friday, the</hi> 25<hi>th April, and they are ordered for Execution on the</hi> 9<hi>th May.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I thought it my duty, not only from repeated ſolicitations, but that I might be relieved from numerous verbal narrations, to ſend this to Mr. Folwell's preſs. I have no emolument in its pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication; and ſo far from ſetting down "aught in malice," I forgive them, as they are my fellow-creatures; but they muſt abide by the lenient laws of my country; and hope their God, who is my God, will be merciful.</p>
