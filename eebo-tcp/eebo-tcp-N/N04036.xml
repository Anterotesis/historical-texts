            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>I AM glad to ſee you all here again to Day; and hope you are in Health, and have had ſufficient Proviſion, and am now ready to hear what you have to ſay to Me.</p>

                  <speaker>Loron;</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brother,</hi> We are in good Health this Morning; and rejoice that your Excellency and the Gentlemen are all well alſo this Morning.</p>
                  <p>And as your Excellency deſir'd Yeſterday that we may ſpeak freely, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare we now deſire to renew the Treaty made in the Year 1727.</p>
                  <p>Which Treaty your Excellency has by you; and is the ſame we now mean. This is really the firſt Treaty, and thoſe that were at the Treaty then, and their Children and Grand Children are obliged to obſerve it.</p>
                  <p>This is what we depend upon; and if any Thing ſhould fall out contrary thereto, that Treaty is to be conſulted, and both Sides to be judg'd by it.</p>
                  <p>The Treaty we have ſafe by us here; and though we don't underſtand Writing, the Treaty will ſpeak for it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Article of Trade is the chief and moſt material Thing; therefore is firſt to be conſidered. Some Time after the beginning of which Treaty, in 1726, the Trade was altered: And at the Concluſion of the Treaty afterwards, it was promis'd, That the Trade ſhould be better regulated for the future: And it was further told us, if any Body ſhould ſell cheaper than the Engliſh, this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, would go beyond them, particularly the French, who were poorer than the Engliſh, and could not afford to ſell cheaper. That at the firſt beginning of Trade a Stroud Blanket was <hi>Thirty Shillings</hi>: Corn was <hi>Seven Shillings</hi> per Buſhel: Powder was <hi>Four Shillings</hi> per Pound: Shot at <hi>Ten Pence</hi> per Pound: And a ſtrip'd Blanket was <hi>Twenty Shillings.</hi> And for all other little Things, which can't at preſent be enumerated, they were ſold for a leſs Price at that Time than at this.</p>
                  <p>What is now ſaid is the Truth concerning the Trade; which we are very uneaſy under, that all Things ſhould grow dearer every Year.</p>
                  <p>And as your Excellency deſired us to ſpeak the Truth, we ſhall be very free and open, and ſpeak the whole Truth.</p>
               </sp>

                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:004976_0006_100E4F0F4098D500"/>
                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>That is my deſire that you ſhould uſe the greateſt Freedom and Liberty; it being the End of our Meeting, that we ſhould have a right Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of each other.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Loron,</speaker>
                  <p>The reaſon of our mentioning the Affair of Trade, is becauſe that Matter is the chief Band of our Peace and Friendſhip, and therefore ſhould be well ſetled and concluded.</p>
                  <p>The Trade is not well furniſhed; and Things are not ſuitable as formerly, which will ſlacken Love.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>If you can mention any other Particulars concerning the Trade which you have not ſpoken of, endeavour to recollect them, and enumerate them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Loron,</speaker>
                  <p>At the Treaty in 1727, Governour DUMMER told us, he could ſupply us much cheaper than the French, who us'd yearly to make us a Preſent of Powder and Shot, which the Engliſh could better a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ord than they.</p>
                  <p>Which Preſent we never have had, though we are daily looking out for it.</p>
                  <p>And as to the Truck-Houſe here, it is always wanting Proviſions, Tobacco, and many other neceſſary Things.</p>
                  <p>As for a Hundred Buſhels of Corn, it is nothing; for it will not Supply a Buſhel a Man when we come to Trade. Nay, Two Hundred Buſhels is really nothing when we come to Trade, being ſo very little and inſufficient that we are forc'd to divide it.</p>
                  <p>We deſire there may be ſo much that every Man may have what he can pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, which will then be enough.</p>
                  <p>And we deſire that a Liſt of the Prizes of the Goods may be poſted up here; and that Two Men may be choſen with an Interpreter to view the Truck-Houſes, Spring and Fall by the Government to ſee that nothing be wanting therein.</p>
                  <p>Another Grievance is, That it was ſaid, none of your young Men, ſhould go into our Woods to Hunt; but ſhould continue by the Water-Side, which is not comply'd withal.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon of our mentioning it is, If they kill our hunting Game, we have nothing elſe to live upon; whereas the Engliſh till the Ground, and have other Ways to ſupport themſelves. This Practice if continued, will deſtroy our Livelihood.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to another Head, and ſpeak for our Tribes in general, That <hi>Jabez Bradbury</hi> may be our Truck Maſter here at St. <hi>George</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon thereof is; <hi>Jabez</hi> can underſtand us, and we him; and it is very difficult for one that don't underſtand the Language to Trade with us.</p>
                  <p>When we begun to trade, it us'd to be the Cuſtom to give Money for Peltry, but now we can't underſtand Cyphering; and they tell us, Your Peltry comes to ſo much; by which as we don't underſtand it, we are cheated, being obliged to depend upon the Word of the Truck-Maſter for the Weight by which we often ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>We have done concerning the Trade.</p>
                  <p>

What we have now repeated was engag'd in Governour DUMMER's Treaty; and we deſire thoſe Things may now be remembred and agreed to that we may Live in Love and Peace.</p>
                  <p>As I was the Chief in that Day, and was the Cauſe of our Tribes complying with that Treaty; they deſire me now to ſtrengthen my ſelf and have it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd.</p>
                  <p>This is all we have to ſay at preſent.</p>

                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>Do you mean this is all you have to ſay on any Head whatſoever?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Loron,</speaker>
                  <p>This is at preſent all. We now wait an Anſwer from your Excellency.</p>

                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>I ſhall be glad to hear all you have to ſay on every Head, that I may conſider all the Matters together.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Loron,</speaker>
                  <p>We have one Article more to mention, It was ſaid in the Time of Governour <hi>DUMMER's</hi> Treaty, the Engliſh deſir'd to go no further than the Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Water reliſh'd. The Engliſh then told us, they would not ſtep a Foot over that Liſle. It is a very long Foot that reaches from that Line to the Place from whence we came.</p>
                  <p>This is all we have to ſay at preſent; and we have here the Treaty which we deſire your Excellency to look over, and then return it to us again.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>We have Governour <hi>DUMMER</hi>'s Treaty in the ſame manner you have, which we brought with us, and we will compare that with your's, and ſee that it be ſame, and then will make uſe of our own.</p>
                  <p>Which was accordingly done to the Satisfaction of the Tribes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>The Engliſh Government think as well as you, that they ought to regulate themſelves by Governour <hi>DUMMER</hi>'s Treaty, and that it is binding on our Children and Grand Children, as you have ſaid. And we are glad you have deſired to walk by Governour <hi>DUMMER</hi>'s Treaty, that we may determine Things by it: And I will look over that Treaty and conſider of it; and of every Thing elſe you have ſaid. And I deſire you would with Openneſs and Freedom declare any Thing elſe you have to ſay now, becauſe the great Council of <hi>Boſton</hi> is near at Hand, and we muſt ſoon go there; And I deſire that we may finiſh ſo that we may have an Opportunity to dine together before our Return to <hi>Boſton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Are you ſatisfyed that the Treaty we have now ſhewn you is the ſame with that you have by you?</p>

                  <p>We are grieved at ſome Accidents about killing of Horſes by our young Men. As ſoon as we heard of it, we ſent to them to forbid ſuch Practices.</p>

                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>The Government was alſo ſorry when they heard of it. And upon our hearing that the Men to whom the Horſes belong'd, had taken the Guns from the young Men, we recommended it to them to deliver up the Guns again to them, leſt it ſhould be a Prejudice to them, expecting the young Men would make Satisfaction for the Injuries done: I deſire to know whether they have done ſo?</p>

                  <speaker>Loron,</speaker>
                  <p>There is no Satisfaction, but the keeping their Guns, which has been a great Damage to them.</p>

                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>I am ſenſible of it; and therefore recommended that the Guns ſhould be given them again, upon their engaging Satisfaction, which now we are ſenſible has not been done; and therefore ſhall enquire into that Affair.</p>

                  <p>As your Excellency was mentioning, that the great Court was near; and you wou'd return Home; we are of the ſame Mind, but deſire there may be no more haſte than good Speed; that we may moderately conſider and determine Things, that we may go away in Peace.</p>

                  <p>I have conſidered what Sachem Loron ſaid Yeſterday and what the other Chiefs have now ſaid, and ſhall give you an Anſwer with all Freedom and Sincerity.</p>
                  <p>The Government of this Province is deſirous as well as you, to renew the Treaty made and concluded by Governour <hi>DUMMER</hi> in the Year 1727, at <hi>Caſco-Bay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We think with you, that we and you, with our and your Children and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Children are bound and obliged to obſerve and perform it.</p>
                  <p>And you rightly obſerve the ſaid Treaty to be in writing and <hi>muſt ſpeak for itſelf.</hi> And that as you ſay, It muſt be conſulted by us both and we muſt be judged and concluded by it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſpeak firſt of Trade, becauſe you mention'd it firſt.</p>
                  <p>And it is truly, as you ſay, the chief Tye of Friendſhip and Union between us and your Tribes.</p>
                  <p>It is true, That in Governour <hi>DUMMER</hi>'s Treaty you were told, the Engliſh would ſupply you cheaper than any other Nation whatſoever, in which the <hi>French</hi> muſt be included. And you will find by what I am now going to ſay, the Engliſh have performed their Agreement with you in that Reſpect. The Juſtice of this Government towards you will appear in thoſe very Articles you mention'd.</p>
                  <p>Yeſterday you obſerv'd, That in the Year 1727, when Governour <hi>DUMMER</hi>'s Treaty was made, that ſtroud Blankets were 30ſ a piece. Corn 7ſ pr. Buſhel, Powder 4ſ. pr. Pound, Shot at 10<hi>d.</hi> pr. Pound, ſtrip'd Blankets at 20ſ a peice. And I would obſerve to you, that at that Time a Pound of your Bever was ſold at 9ſ. pr. Pound, and other Peltry in proportion.</p>
                  <p>We are ſenſible, that Strouds are now ſold at the Truck-Houſe from 45ſ. to 50ſ. a piece, Corn is now ſold at 10ſ. pr. Buſhel, Powder at 7ſ. Shot at 19<hi>d.</hi> ſtrip'd Blankets at 38ſ. Now the ſame Strouds which are ſold to you at <hi>St. George</hi>'s Fort from 45ſ. to 50ſ. a piece, are ſold at <hi>Boſton</hi> to the Engliſh for 52ſ. a piece, Corn is ſold at <hi>Boſton</hi> from 12ſ. to 16ſ. a Buſhel, Powder at <hi>Boſton</hi> is ſold for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I will endeavour to explain to you the Reaſon of the Difference between the Prices of theſe Goods at the Time of Governour <hi>DUMMER</hi>'s Treaty, and the preſent Prices.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It was expreſly told you by Governour <hi>DUMMER</hi> that the Prices of Goods would be ſometimes higher and ſometimes lower, according to the Plenty or Scarcity of them.</p>
                  <p>In the next Place the 30ſ. which you obſerve the ſtroud Blankets were ſold for at the Time of that Treaty was 30ſ. Paper Money. And I would obſerve to you, that the Paper Money ſince that Time has ſunk ſo much in value, that 55ſ. of it now is worth no more than 30ſ. was then; ſo that the Blankets which you now give from 45ſ. to 50ſ. for, are not ſo dear as the Blankets at 30ſ. in the time of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>DUMMER</hi>'s Treaty.</p>
                  <p>To make this Matter ſtill more plain, A Pound of your Bever which the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh then gave 9ſ. for, they now give 16ſ. for; and yet we do not complain, tho' the Price of your Bever has roſe more upon us, than the Price of our Proviſions upon you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Loron,</speaker>
                  <p>As to the Price of Bever that is nothing to the purpoſe, for every Thing is at a ſtand. The Price of Bever and the Goods now are the ſame as then.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>To explain this yet further.</p>
                  <p>A leſs Quantity of Bever will purchaſe a ſtroud Blanket at this time, than what would purchaſe one in Governour <hi>DUMMER</hi>'s time. And it is a Demonſtration of the Juſtice of this Government to you, that you have the Goods at the Truck Houſes at a more moderate Price than the Engliſh have at <hi>Boſton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Reaſon of the Advance of the Price of our Goods is, that the War with <hi>Spain</hi> and all Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> at this Time, makes the Powder much dearer than it would otherwiſe be, as alſo all ſorts of Proviſions.</p>
                  <p>And another Proof of our Juſtice and Friendſhip is, that the Government loſe conſiderably every Year by letting you have their Goods at ſuch low Prizes, which they do purely out of Friendſhip and Kindneſs to you.</p>
                  <p>What is now ſaid concerns the Juſtice of the Government only.</p>
                  <p>If you are ever impos'd upon by the Truck Maſters it's a great Fault, which the Government don't allow of; and when they know it, will always endeavour to prevent.</p>
                  <p>I don't like that Practice of the Truck-Maſters which you mention, their tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you what your Bever and Peltry comes to, in the Lump, without giving you a particular Account of it; and then delivering you Goods in exchange for it after the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me Manner.</p>
                  <p>This is ſuch a Method as ſeems to me to give the Truck-Maſters room to blind both You and the Government, if they think ſit.</p>
                  <p>To prevent this for the future, I ſhall take care that the Weight of your Bever and Peltry ſmall be marked down by the Truck-Maſter; and he ſhall deliver. you a Bill of Parcels of the quantity and price of Bever, and the Goods p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in exchange for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="unknown:004976_0012_100E4F1A8E274E68"/>
By this Means you will have a Paper delivered to you containing the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and price of your Bever, and the particulars and price of the Goods delivered to you in exchange for them; and by means of that Paper you will ſee whether you are impos'd upon; and if you will complain to the Government you ſhall always have ſtrict Juſtice done you.</p>
                  <p>And I will order an Account of the ſeveral Prices of your Peltry andour Goods to be poſted up in the Truck-Houſes, that you may be inform'd of the Prices of both.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Col. Lewis,</speaker>
                  <p>That is very well.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>This is what Iat preſent think of; and if the Government at any Time, ſhall find out other or better Methods to prevent your being impos'dup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Truck-Maſters, they will do it.</p>
                  <p>I think it is very reaſonable, ſince you depend upon ſupplying your ſelves at our Truck-Houſes with Proviſions and other Neceſſaries, that they ſhould be ſufficiently ſtored with them for your Wants and Demands; therefore the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will take Care it ſhall be done; and will provide ſufficient Stores for every particular Perſon as they ſhall want.</p>
                  <p>And as you have deſired, I will take Care that the Government ſhall appoint two fit Perſons in the Spring and Fall, with an Interpreter, to view the Truck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Houſes; and you ſhall have ſeaſonable Notice of it, that if you have any thing to complain of, you may have an Opportunity to be heard by the Perſons ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
                  <p>As to Mr. <hi>Bradbury</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wood</hi>'s being appointed Truck-Maſters at <hi>George</hi>'s and <hi>Richmond</hi> Forts, the great Council of the Province which chuſe thoſe Officers, will always chuſe ſuitable Perſons for that Service. Since you deſire to have Mr. <hi>Bradbury</hi> for your Truck-Maſter at <hi>St. George</hi>'s, I will recommend him to the great Council.</p>
                  <p>I think his underſtanding your Language is a conſiderable Qualification for a Truck-Maſter; which I doubt not will have it's Weight with them.</p>
                  <p>I don't find by the Treaty, that Governour <hi>DUMMER</hi> ever promis'd that the Government would (as the <hi>French</hi> did) every Year make you a Preſent of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Shot.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Loron,</speaker>
                  <p>It may not be wrote; but it was told us ſo then.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>As the Treaty is in Writing, we muſt reſort to that for the Truth of Things.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding you never were Friends to the Engliſh, as you have been to the French in Time of War, yet this Government have frequently made you conſiderable Preſents; and the Generoſity of the Government will always be proportion'd to your Friendſhip to the Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall always treat you with Kindneſs; but our Preſents muſt be the Effect of our Friendſhip and Generoſity; and not of any Terms of Agreement to make them to you at certain Times and Seaſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="unknown:004976_0013_100E4F1D340E0108"/>
The Engliſh Government have always look'd upon it as their Honour to treat their Friends with Generoſity.</p>
                  <p>I am ſenſible you ſupport your ſelves by hunting in your Woods, and not by Tillage of your Lands as you have obſerv'd.</p>
                  <p>I therefore think if any of our young Men hunt on your Grounds, it's a great Piece of Injuſtice done you; and I ſhall always look upon it as ſuch.</p>
                  <p>And I will recommend it to the great Council to prevent ſuch Treſpaſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made upon you; and to oblige the young Men for all ſuch Offences to pay double Damages.</p>
                  <p>As to the Settlements of Lands, as you obſerv'd Yeſterday, Governour <hi>DUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MER</hi>'s Treaty muſt <hi>judge</hi> between us and decide that Matter.</p>

                  <speaker>Loron,</speaker>
                  <p>As to the Firſt. We deſir'd the Engliſh might not go where the Freſh Water runs.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>The Treaty muſt determine that Matter; Therefore I ſhall read ſeveral Paragraphs of the Treaty it ſelf.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To which you then made Anſwer</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>We underſtand it very well, and agree to it, that it ſhall be ſo; The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies we underſtand are to be determined by impartial Judges and diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted Perſons, appointed for that Purpoſe, to do equal Juſtice.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And in your Treaty of Submiſſion, at that Time, in</hi> Page 9, <hi>you have ſtipulated,</hi>
                     <q>That His Majeſty's Subjects the Engliſh, ſhall and may peaceably and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly enter upon, improve and forever enjoy all and ſingular their Rights of Lands and former Settlements, Properties and Poſſeſſions, within the Eaſtern Parts of the ſaid Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi>; together with all Iſlands, Iſlets, Shores, Beaches and Fiſhery within the ſame, without any Moleſtation or Claims by us or any other Indians; and be in no ways moleſted, interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or diſturbed therein. Saving unto the <hi>Penobſcott, Norridgewock,</hi> and other Tribes within His Majeſty's Province aforeſaid, and their natural Deſcendants reſpectively, all their Land, Liberties and Properties, not by them conveyed or ſold to or poſſeſſed by any of the Engliſh Subjects as aforeſaid; as alſo the Priviledge of Fiſhing, Hunting and Fowling as formerly.</q>

If any Controverſy or Difference at any Time hereafter happen to ariſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween any of the Engliſh and Indians for any real or ſuppoſed Wrong or Injury done on either Side, no private Revenge ſhall be taken for the ſame; but proper Application ſhall be made to his Majeſty's Government upon the Place for Remedy or Redreſs thereof in a due courſe of Juſtice.</q>

                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>Do you acknowledge that <hi>Winnemouet</hi> was your Sachem?</p>

                  <p>We have heard of that very often, and if we ſhould hear of it again, it would ſignify nothing; if we come to Agreement, we deſire all thoſe Things may be put under the Table.</p>

                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>We don't deſire to croud you in any of your Settlements.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Loron,</speaker>
                  <p>We are more tender of the Engliſh than any People, and deſire their Friendſhip; but would not be crowded nor croud them.</p>
                  <p>We greatly rejoice in your Excellency's laſt Speech.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>As this Government will always be careful that King <hi>GEORGE</hi>'s Subjects ſhall not take away an Inch of Land from you, ſo they will always ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them in their Settlement of Lands to which they have a juſt Right and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion; which you muſt acknowledge to be reaſonable, for we ſhall always keep our Agreements with you, and expect you to keep your Agreements with all King <hi>GEORGE</hi>'s Subjects, both with reſpect to Lands and all other Matters.</p>
                  <p>As to your young Men killing the Horſes; we as well as you are ſorry for it. Your killing our Cattle does our Inhabitants as much Injury as our taking away your Bever and Guns; they being as neceſſary for our Support, as Hunting for yours.</p>
                  <p>The Engliſh have always expected, and you have always acknowledged, that when the young Men commit ſuch Treſpaſſes, they ſhould make Reparation for ſuch Damage done. If we ſhould uphold and countenance our young Men, or you countenance yours in ſuch Matters, it would ſoon break all Friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us. It is therefore neceſſary for us, when our young Men commit Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes that they ſhould be obliged to make Reſtitution And it is as neceſſary that your young Men ſhould be obliged to do the ſame in ſuch Caſes.</p>
                  <p>Since I have been here, I have received many Complaints from the Inhabitants that they have had their Cattle, Horſes and Hoggs kill'd to a great Value.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Loron</speaker>
                  <p>, It may be the Vermin have killed them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>Some Gentlemen of the Council have inquir'd into the Truth and Juſtice of the Complaints; and I have rejected all thoſe that are not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Proof.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Loron,</speaker>
                  <p>I know of my certain Knowledge, that Bears and Wolves have killed a great many.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>We therefore don't take Notice of any ſuch Complaints, as are not certainly proved by Witneſſes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Loron,</speaker>
                  <p>As to the Horſes mentioned Yeſterday; they were killed by young Men, who found them at a great Diſtance from any Habitation; however they are pretty well paid for them, the Owners having their Guns; ſo we ſhould be glad to have that Matter drop. For the future we ſhall take double Care; and Charge our young Men to do ſo no more: And we pray, that when the Cattle ſtray away, and are mir'd or hung in Crotches of Trees, your young Men may not charge us with killing of them.</p>

                  <speaker>GOVRENOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>We will take Care not to be impos'd upon by our young Men in that Matter.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Loron,</speaker>
                  <p>Sometimes the Engliſh deſire us to look for their loſt Cattle, and we find them dead. We ought not to be charged with them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>It is not reaſonable you ſhould.</p>
                  <p>But beſides the Horſes, one Mr. <hi>Kogg</hi> loſt an Ox, which <hi>Ackumbuett's</hi> Sons own, they had killed before Witneſſes. Another Ox was kili'd which Col. <hi>Lewis</hi> ſaw the Bones and Hoofs of, (two Engliſh Men being preſent.) As to our young Men making themſelves Satisfaction for their Horſes which were killed by taking away your Guns, we don't like it; becauſe when either Side pretend to take their own Satisfaction, it will create Quarrels, and break Friendſhip; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Method muſt be to complain to the Government, and leave to them to order proper Satisfaction.</p>

                  <speaker>Moxus,</speaker>
                  <p>As for two of the Cattle kill'd by <hi>Ackumbuett's</hi> Son, and my Son; they were in Liquor, and hardly know what they did; when I came to know it I paid 25 ſ. for them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>That Money was paid for a Horſe and Steer that I have not mentioned.</p>

                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>As to the two Oxen which you acknowledge were killed, what Satisfaction do you propoſe to make for them?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Loron,</speaker>
                  <p>As for them, we believe our young Men killed them; and when we return, we ſhall have a Meeting, and ſee that they be paid for.</p>
                  <p>As to the Horſes, the Guns we think may ſatisfy for them, and we ſhould be glad to hear no more about that Matter.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>I have appointed two Gentlemen on Oath to apprize the value of the Oxen; and they have valued them at 40 <hi>l.</hi>

                  <speaker>Col. Lewis</speaker>
                  <p>, As to the Oxen I view'd the Bones; and don't think they were ſo big as Oxen's Bones, and therefore not worth ſo much.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Loron,</speaker>
                  <p>There was a Sloop come in here and ſhe run aground: Two Canoes were coming along and the Sloop Men deſired the Indians to help them, which they did; and for a Reward the Sloop Men made them drunk, put them on the Beach, and before they got ſober they loft their Canoes and three Guns.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>We are inform'd, That the Indians came on board of their own accord; and would not leave the Veſſel, though often deſired, till they were Drunk; therefore ought to charge their Loſs to their own Folly in drinking too much.</p>

                  <speaker>Loron,</speaker>
                  <p>As to theſe Things you have mentioned them; and they may be ſettled between two or three.

                  <p>The Inhabitants complain, that ſometimes your young Men ſtop the Oxen and prevent their bringing Home their Hay.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Loron,</speaker>
                  <p>We are old Men, and can't have our Eyes every where.</p>

                  <speaker>Loron,</speaker>
                  <p>We are loth to enter into little Complaints, about the Engliſh killing our Dogs, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> But are reſolved on our Part to endeavour to prevent ſuch Things for the future. You have an Advantage with regard to reſtraining your young Men, having better Government than we. But we will do what we can in theſe Matters.</p>
                  <p>There was ſomething forgot about the Truck-Trade Yeſterday. One Thing is, that the little Skins call'd Sable-Skins us'd to be ſold for 10ſ.; but now for 8ſ. We deſire they may be at the firſt Price.</p>
                  <p>Another about Bear-Skins, they grow ſcarce, and we can't afford to bring them at the cuſtomary Price.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>GOVERNOUR,</speaker>
                  <p>As to the Sable-Skins, we did give 10ſ. a piece for, two Years ago, and ſold them for 8ſ.; and now we can't get but 8ſ. Therefore as you have our Goods at the ſame or leſs Price than the People at <hi>Boſton</hi>; ſo we ought to give no more for your Peltry than we can get for it there.</p>
