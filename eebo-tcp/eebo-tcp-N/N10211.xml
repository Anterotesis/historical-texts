            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT is not with any de≈øign or de≈øire unnece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to expo≈øe the late oppre≈ø≈øors of that good prote≈øtant people which is in <hi>New-England,</hi> that the authors of the en≈øuing <hi>vindication</hi> have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhed what is herewith emitted. But the <hi>agents</hi> lately ≈øent from thence could not be faithful to their tru≈øt, if when the people whom they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent are publicly (as well as privately) <hi>a≈øper≈øed,</hi> they ≈øhould not (either by them≈øelves, or by furni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øome other with materials for ≈øuch an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking) <hi>vindicate</hi> tho≈øe who have been ≈øo deeply injured.</p>
            <p>As for Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> his account, which he calls <hi>impartial,</hi> he has wronged <hi>New-England</hi> thereby, in ≈øome other particulars be≈øides tho≈øe in≈øi≈øted on, in the ≈øub≈øequent <hi>apology.</hi> For he does en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012973_0003_0F903FD788328A90"/>
to make the world believe that the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts</hi> refu≈øed to an≈øwer to the <hi>quo-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto</hi> pro≈øecuted again≈øt their <hi>charter:</hi> Than which mi≈ørepre≈øentation nothing can be more untrue or injurious. An account concerning that matter hath formerly (and more than once) been made public, in the which it is mo≈øt truly affirmed, <q>That when the <hi>quo-warranto</hi> was i≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øued out again≈øt the governor and company of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts</hi> colony in <hi>New-England</hi> in the year 1683, the then king did by his decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration enjoin a few particular per≈øons to make their defence at their own charge, without any public ≈øtock; which ≈øhewed that there was a re≈øolution to take away that charter: yet the governor and company appointed an attorney to an≈øwer to the <hi>quo warranto;</hi> but the ≈øuit was let fall in the court of <hi>king's-bench,</hi> and a new ≈øuit began by <hi>≈øcire facias</hi> in court of <hi>chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> where time was not allowed to make defence. The former attorney for that colony brought ≈øeveral merchants to te≈øtify that in the time allowed (which was from <hi>April</hi> 16, till <hi>June</hi> 18) in was impo≈ø≈øible to have a new let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of attorney returned from <hi>New-England.</hi> The then lord keeper <hi>North</hi> replied, that no time ought to be given. So was judgment entered again≈øt them before they could po≈ø≈øibly plead for them≈øelves.</q> By this the impartial reader may judge what ingenuity and veracity is in Mr. <hi>Palmer's</hi> account.</p>
            <p>There is lately come forth another <hi>≈øcandalous pamphlet,</hi> called <hi>New-England's faction di≈øcovered.</hi> The author has not put his name to it: But it is ≈øuppo≈øed to be written by a certain per≈øon
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012973_0004_0F903FD8CFEAD440"/>
known to be a prodigy for impudence and lying. The reflection in it not only on <hi>New-England</hi> in general, but on particular per≈øons there as well as in <hi>England,</hi> are ≈øo notoriou≈øly and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciou≈øly fal≈øe, as that it mu≈øt needs be much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath a great mind to take notice of ≈øuch <hi>latra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> or to an≈øwer them any otherwi≈øe than with contempt. When we are treated with the buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonry and railery of ≈øuch ungenteel pens, it is good to remember the old ≈øaying, <hi>mognum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliae remedium, negligentia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for what Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> does in his preface in≈øinuate concerning the <hi>New-Englanders</hi> being <hi>common-wealths-men, enemies to monarchy, and to the church of England,</hi> that is ≈øuch a <hi>≈øham</hi> as every one ≈øees through it.</p>
            <p>There are none in the world that do more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concur with the <hi>doctrine</hi> of the church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> contained in the 39 articles, than do <hi>the churches in New-England,</hi> as is manife≈øt from the confe≈ø≈øion of their faith publi≈øhed in the year 1680. Only as to <hi>liturgy and ceremonies</hi> they differ; for which cau≈øe alone it was that they, or their fathers, tran≈øported them≈øelves into that <hi>American de≈øert,</hi> as being de≈øirous to wor≈øhip God in that way which they thought was mo≈øt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ≈øcriptures. The <hi>platform of church di≈øcipline</hi> con≈øented unto by the elders and me≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øengers of the churches a≈ø≈øembled in a general ≈øynod at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> in the year 1647, ≈øheweth that they are as to <hi>church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for the <hi>congregational way.</hi> The judiciou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned Mr. <hi>Philip Nye</hi> has long ≈øince evinced that no form of church-government (no not that which is epi≈øcopal) is more con≈øi≈øtent with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012973_0005_0F903FD9073179F8"/>
or with the king's ≈øupremacy, than that of the <hi>way-congregational,</hi> which ≈øome will needs call <hi>independent.</hi> But there are a ≈øort of men, who call tho≈øe that are for <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> liberties, and that rejoice in the government of their pre≈øent maje≈øties, king <hi>William</hi> and queen <hi>Mary,</hi> by the name of <hi>republicans,</hi> and repre≈øent all ≈øuch as enemies of monarchy and of the church. It is not our ≈øingle opinion only, but we can ≈øpeak it on the behalf of the generality of their maje≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ≈øubjects in <hi>New-England,</hi> that they believe (without any diminution to the glory of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer princes) the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> nation was never ≈øo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in a <hi>king,</hi> or in a <hi>queen,</hi> as at this day. And the God of heaven, who has ≈øet them on the throne of the≈øe kingdoms, grant them long and pro≈øperou≈øly to reign.</p>

                  <head>THE REVOLUTION IN NEW-ENGLAND JUSTIFIED.</head>
                  <p>THE doctrine of <hi>pa≈ø≈øive obedience</hi> and <hi>non-re≈øi≈øtance,</hi> which a ≈øort of men did of late, when they thought the world would never change, cry up as divine truth, is by means of the happy <hi>revolution</hi> in the≈øe nations, exploded, and the a≈ø≈øertors of it become ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>No man does really approve of the <hi>revolution</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> but mu≈øt ju≈øtify that in <hi>New-England</hi> al≈øo; for the latter was effected in compliance with the former, neither was there any de≈øign among the <hi>people in New-England</hi> to rea≈ø≈øume their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>charter-government,</hi> until his pre≈øent maje≈øty's intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed de≈øcent into <hi>England,</hi> to re≈øcue the nation from <hi>≈ølavery</hi> as well as <hi>popery,</hi> was known to them (for indeed to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted it before that would have been madne≈øs.) They
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012973_0007_0F903FDA86D5ADF8"/>
con≈øidered that the men then u≈øurping government in <hi>New-England</hi> were king <hi>James</hi>'s creatures, who had invaded both the <hi>liberty and property of Engli≈øh prote≈øtants</hi> after ≈øuch a manner as perhaps the like was never known in any part of the world where the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> nation has any government; and the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion</hi> which they had obtained from the late king <hi>James</hi> was more illegal and arbitrary, than that granted to <hi>Dudley</hi> and <hi>Emp≈øon</hi> by king <hi>Henry</hi> 7th. Or than it may be was ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given to any by king <hi>James</hi> him≈øelf, or by any one that ever ≈øwayed the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> ≈øcepter, which was a grievance into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable; and yet they de≈øired not to make them≈øelves judges in a ca≈øe which ≈øo nearly concerned them, but in≈øtead of har≈øher treatment of tho≈øe who had tyrannized over them, they only ≈øecured them that they might not betray that country into the hands of <hi>the late king,</hi> or of king <hi>Lewis,</hi> which they had rea≈øon enough to believe (con≈øidering their characters and di≈øpo≈øitions) they were inclined to do. They de≈øigned not to revenge them≈øelves on their enemies, which they could as ea≈øily have done as a thou≈øand men are able to kill one, and therefore when they ≈øecured their per≈øons, they declared (as in their <hi>declaration</hi> printed at <hi>Bo≈øton</hi> in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is to be ≈øeen) that they would <hi>leave it to the king and parliament of</hi> England, <hi>to inflict what puni≈øhment they ≈øhould think meet for ≈øuch criminals.</hi> Their ≈øeizing and ≈øecuring the governor, was no more than was done in <hi>England,</hi> at <hi>Hull, Dover, Plymouth, &amp;c.</hi> that ≈øuch a man as Mr. <hi>John Palmer</hi> ≈øhould exclaim again≈øt it, is not to be wondered at, ≈øeeing he was one of the governor's tools, being of his council, made a judge by him, and too much concerned in ≈øome illegal and arbitrary proceedings; but his confidence is wonderful, that he ≈øhould publi≈øh in print that neither him≈øelf nor ≈øir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Andro≈ø≈øe,</hi> nor others of them who had been ≈øecured by the people in <hi>New-England, had any crimes laid to their charge,</hi> whereas the fore≈øaid declaration emitted the very day they were ≈øecured, doth plainly ≈øet forth their crimes. And in the preface of his book he hath the≈øe words; viz.</p>
                  <p>

And whereas by con≈øtant u≈øage any per≈øon might remove out of the country at his plea≈øure, a law was made that no man ≈øhould do ≈øo without the governor's leave.

liberty to go for <hi>England</hi> to complain of their being oppre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed by <hi>arbitrary governors?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4.

                  <p>It hath indeed been pleaded that all this was but what the laws of the country before the change of the government did allow. But this is vainly pretended, for there was no ≈øuch law in force at the time when the≈øe ≈øums were levied, the former laws which did authorize it, were repealed <hi>October</hi> 10, 1683, ≈øome years before Sir <hi>Edmund Andro≈ø≈øe</hi> and his accomplices had invaded the rights and liberties of the people there. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, in tho≈øe parts of the country where there were never any ≈øuch laws in force, particularly in <hi>Plymouth</hi> colony, this money was levied, which they heavily complained of. Yet further, in another act dated <hi>Feb.</hi> 15, 1687, they did without any colour of ancient law make an additional du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of impo≈øt and exci≈øe, which rai≈øed the duty, ≈øome ten ≈øhillings, ≈øome twenty ≈øhillings <hi>per</hi> pipe on wines, and ≈øo on other things. Nay they levied monies on <hi>Connecticut</hi> colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny contrary to their charter, which was never vacated, than which nothing more illegal and arbitrary could have been perpetrated by them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They did not only act according to the≈øe illegal taxes, but they did <hi>inflict ≈øevere puni≈øhment on tho≈øe true Engli≈øh men who did oppo≈øe their arbitrary proceedings,</hi> as ≈øhall be made to appear in many in≈øtances. When the inhabitants of <hi>Ip≈øwich</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> were required to choo≈øe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øioner to tax that town, ≈øome principal per≈øons there that could not comply with what was demanded of them, did mode≈øtly give their rea≈øons, for which they were committed to goal, as guilty of high mi≈ødemeanours, and denied an <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beus corpus,</hi> and were obliged to an≈øwer it at a court of <hi>oyer</hi> and <hi>terminer</hi> at <hi>Bo≈øton.</hi> And that they might be ≈øure to be found guilty, <hi>jurors</hi> were picked of ≈øuch as were no freehol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, nay of ≈øtrangers; the pri≈øoners pleading <hi>the privilege of Engli≈øhmen</hi> not to be taxed without their own con≈øent, they were told that <hi>the laws of</hi> England <hi>would not follow them to the end of the earth,</hi> they meant the privileges of the Engli≈øh law, for the penalties they re≈øolved ≈øhould follow

them <hi>quo jure qu√¢que injuri√¢.</hi> And why ≈øhould they in≈øi≈øt on, and talk of the privileges of Engli≈øhmen, when it had been declared in the governor's council, <hi>that the king's ≈øubjects in</hi> New-England <hi>did not differ much from ≈ølaves, and that the only difference was, that they were not bought and ≈øold?</hi> But to go on with the matter before us; in as much as the pri≈øoners mentioned had a≈ø≈øerted their <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> liberties, they were ≈øeverely handled, not only impri≈øoned for ≈øeveral weeks, but fined and bound to their good behaviour; Mr. <hi>John Wi≈øe</hi> was fined fifty pounds be≈øides co≈øts of court, deprived of the means of his ≈øub≈øi≈øtance, and gave a thou≈øand pounds bond for good behavior. And Mr. <hi>John Appleton</hi> was fined fifty pounds and to give a thou≈øand pounds bond for good behavior, and moreover declared incapable to bear office, be≈øides unrea≈øonable fees. After the ≈øame manner did they proceed with ≈øeveral others belonging to <hi>Ip≈øwich.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe the towns men of <hi>Rowley, Sali≈øbury, Andover,</hi> &amp;c. had the ≈øame mea≈øure. And the king's ≈øubjects were not only oppre≈ø≈øed thus in the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts</hi> colony, but in <hi>Plymouth.</hi> For when <hi>Shadrach Wild boar</hi> the town-clerk of <hi>Taunton</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> did, with the con≈øent of the town, ≈øign a mode≈øt paper ≈øignifying their not being free to rai≈øe money on the inhabitants without their own con≈øent by an a≈ø≈øembly, the hone≈øt man was for this committed clo≈øe pri≈øoner, and after that puni≈øhed with a fine of twenty marks and three months impri≈øonment, and bound to find ≈øureties by recognizance to appear the next court, and to be of the good behaviour. As to the matter of fact, the per≈øons concerned in <hi>the≈øe ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and arbitrary judgments</hi> will not have the face to deny them; if they do, there are <hi>affidavits</hi> now in <hi>London</hi> which will evince what hath been related when ever there ≈øhall be occa≈øion for it.</p>
                  <p>It is a vanity in Mr. <hi>Palmer,</hi> to think that he hath an≈øwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this by affirming, but not proving, that the <hi>Ip≈øwich men</hi> a≈ø≈øembled them≈øelves in a <hi>riotous manner;</hi> for that ≈øaying of his is very fal≈øe.

                              <p>Being called by tho≈øe in pre≈øent authority to give my te≈øtimony to the di≈øcour≈øe between Sir <hi>Edmund Andro≈ø≈øe</hi> and my≈øelf, when he came from the Indian war, as he pa≈ø≈øed through <hi>Salem</hi> going for <hi>Bo≈øton</hi> in <hi>March</hi> 1688-9, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refu≈øe it, and therefore declare as followeth, what was the ≈øub≈øtance of that di≈øcour≈øe. Sir <hi>Edmund Andro≈ø≈øe</hi> then governor being acompanied with the attorney-general <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> ≈øecretary <hi>We≈øt,</hi> judge <hi>Palmer,</hi> the room being al≈øo full of other people, mo≈øt of them his attendants, he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to tell me, he would have my judgment about this que≈øtion; <hi>Whether all the lands in</hi> New-England <hi>were not the king's?</hi> I told him I was ≈øurprized with ≈øuch a que≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and was not willing to ≈øpeak to it; that being a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter, if it was a que≈øtion about a matter of religion, I ≈øhould not be aver≈øe, but this being a ≈øtate matter, I did not look upon it as proper for me to declare my mind in it, therefore entreated again and again that I might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øed. Sir <hi>Edmund Andro≈ø≈øe</hi> replied and urged me with much importunity, ≈øaying, Becau≈øe you are a mini≈øter, therefore we de≈øire to know your judgment in it, then I told him, if I mu≈øt ≈øpeak to it, I would only ≈øpeak as a mini≈øter from ≈øcripture and rea≈øon, not medling with the law. He ≈øaid, the king's attorney was pre≈øent there to inform what was law. I then ≈øaid, I did not under≈øtand that the lands of <hi>New-England</hi> were the king's, but the king's ≈øubjects, who had for more than ≈øixty years had the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion and u≈øe of them by a twofold right warranted by the word of God. 1. By a right of ju≈øt occupation from the grand charter in <hi>Gene≈øis</hi> 1≈øt and 9th chapters, whereby God gave the earth to the ≈øons of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> to be ≈øubdued and repleni≈øhed. 2. By a right of purcha≈øe from the Indians, who were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inhabitants, and had po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the land before the Engli≈øh came hither, and that having lived here ≈øixty years. I did certainly know that from the beginning of the≈øe plantations our fathers entered upon the land, partly
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012973_0018_0F903FE507038458"/>
as a wilderne≈øs and <hi>Vacuum Domicilium,</hi> and partly by the con≈øent of the Indians, and therefore care was taken to treat with them, and to gain their con≈øent, giving them ≈øuch a valuable con≈øideration as was to their ≈øatisfaction, and this I told them I had the more certain knowledge of, becau≈øe having learned the Indian language in my younger time, I was at ≈øeveral times made u≈øe of by the government, and by divers particular plantations as an interpreter in treating with the Indians about their lands, which being done and agreed on, the ≈øeveral town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhips and proportions of lands of particular men were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ≈øettled by the government of the country, and therefore I did believe that the lands of <hi>New-England</hi> were the ≈øubjects properties, and not the king's lands. Sir <hi>Edmund Andro≈ø≈øe</hi> and the re≈øt replied, that the lands were the king's, and that he gave the lands within ≈øuch limits to his ≈øubjects by a charter upon ≈øuch conditions as were not performed, and therefore all the lands of <hi>New-England</hi> have returned to the king, and that the attorney general then pre≈øent could tell what was law, who ≈øpake divers things to the ≈øame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe as Sir <hi>Edmund Andro≈ø≈øe</hi> had done, ≈ølighting what I had ≈øaid, and vilifying the Indian title, ≈øaying, they were brutes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if we had po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed and u≈øed the land, they ≈øaid we were the king's ≈øubjects, and what lands the king's ≈øubjects have, they are the king's, and one of them u≈øed ≈øuch an expre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, <hi>where-ever an Engli≈øhman ≈øets his foot, all that he hath is the king's,</hi> and more to the ≈øame purpo≈øe. I told them that ≈øo far as I under≈øtood, we received only the right and power of government from the king's charter within ≈øuch limits and bounds, but the right of the land and ≈øoil we had received from God according to his grand charter to the ≈øons of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and with the con≈øent of the native inhabitants as I had expre≈ø≈øed before. They ≈øtill in≈øi≈øted on the king's right to the land as before, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I told them, I had heard it was a ≈øtanding principle in law and rea≈øon, <hi>nil dat qui non habet;</hi> and from thence I propounded this argument, he that hath no right, can give no right to another, but the king had no right to the lands of <hi>America</hi> before the Engli≈øh came hither, therefore he could give no right to them. I told them, I knew not of any that could be pleaded but from a Popi≈øh principle, that chri≈øtians have a right to the lands of heathen, upon which the Pope as the head of the chri≈øtians had given the <hi>We≈øt-Indies</hi> to the king of <hi>Spain,</hi> but this was di≈øowned by all prote≈øtants. Therefore I left it to them to affirm and prove
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012973_0019_0F903FE5C5AEB640"/>
the king's title. They replied and in≈øi≈øted much upon that, that the king had a right by his ≈øubjects coming and taking po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of this land. And at la≈øt Sir <hi>Edmund Andro≈ø≈øe</hi> ≈øaid with indignation, either you are ≈øubjects or you are rebels, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating, as I under≈øtood him, according to the whole ≈øcope and tendency of his ≈øpeeches and actions, that if we would not yield all the lands of <hi>New-England</hi> to be the king's, ≈øo as to take patents for lands, and to pay rent for the ≈øame, then we ≈øhould not be accounted ≈øubjects but rebels, and treated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. There were many other various replies and an≈øwers on both ≈øides, but this is the ≈øum and ≈øub≈øtance of that di≈øcour≈øe.</p>

the ≈øame, <hi>June,</hi> 21, 1688, he hath the≈øe words. <q>I went to one <hi>Shurte</hi> town-clerk of <hi>Pemyquid,</hi> to know what lea≈øes were made lately, and by whom, and for what quit rent, he told me that above a year ago Captain <hi>Palmer,</hi> and Mr. <hi>We≈øt</hi> produced to them a commi≈ø≈øion from Colonel <hi>Dungan,</hi> to di≈øpo≈øe of all their lands to whoever would take lea≈øes at five ≈øhillings the hundred acres quit rent.

                  <p>And that <hi>oppre≈ø≈øive fees have been extorted by indigent and exacting officers</hi> is declared by Mr. <hi>Hinckley</hi> the pre≈øent gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>New-Plymouth</hi> in his <hi>narrative of the grievances and oppre≈ø≈øions of their maje≈øties good ≈øubjects in the colony of</hi> New-Plymouth <hi>in</hi> New-England, <hi>by the illegal and arbitrary act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the late Government under Sir</hi> Edmund Andro≈ø≈øe, which <hi>narrative</hi> is too large to be here in≈øerted, but it is po≈ø≈øible it may be publi≈øhed by it≈øelf, whereby it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that every corner in the country did ring with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the oppre≈ø≈øions, and (to ≈øpeak in Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi>'s phra≈øe) <hi>horrible u≈øages</hi> of the≈øe ill men. Some pa≈ø≈øages out of Mr. <hi>Hinckley's narrative</hi> re≈øpecting this matter, we ≈øhall here tran≈øcribe, who≈øe words are the≈øe which follow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The bill of co≈øt taxed by judge <hi>Palmer</hi> ≈øeems al≈øo to be the greate≈øt extortion ever heard of before, as thrice twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ≈øhillings for three motions for judgment at the ≈øame term, (and was it not their courte≈øy they did not move ten times one after another at the ≈øame rate) and taxed al≈øo, <hi>five pound for the king's attorney, and one and twenty ≈øhillings for the judges, and ten ≈øhillings for the ≈øheriff,</hi> and other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars as by the ≈øaid bill appeareth, and that which makes it the greater extortion is, that the whole bill of co≈øt was exacted of every one of them, which each of them mu≈øt pay down, or be kept pri≈øoners till they did, though all ≈øeven of them were jointly informed again≈øt in one infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</q> Thus Mr. <hi>Hinckley.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The cry of poor widows and fatherle≈øs is gone up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven again≈øt them on this account; for the probate of a will and letter of admini≈øtration above fifty ≈øhillings hath been extorted out of the hands of the poor, nay they have been ≈øometimes forced to pay more than four pounds, when not much above a crown had been due. Let <hi>Andrew Sergeant</hi> and <hi>Jo≈øeph Quilter</hi> among many others ≈øpeak if this be not true, who were compelled to travel two hundred miles for the probate of a will, and to pay the unrea≈øonable and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øive fees complained of.</p>
                  <p>Be≈øides the≈øe things, under Sir <hi>Edmund</hi>'s government they had wicked ways to extort money when they plea≈øed. Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Coleman</hi> complains (and hath given his oath according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that upon the ≈øuppo≈øed hired evidence of one man he ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012973_0038_0F903FF896A0A210"/>
forty pounds damage in his e≈øtate. And there were complaints all over the country that Sir <hi>Edmund's exci≈øe men</hi> would pretend ≈øickne≈øs on the road, and get a cup of drink of the ho≈øpitable people, but privately drop a piece of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and afterwards make oath that they bought drink at tho≈øe hou≈øes, for which the innocent per≈øons were fined mo≈øt unrea≈øonably, and which was extorted from them, though the≈øe villanies were declared and made known to tho≈øe then in power. <hi>William Goodhue,</hi> and <hi>Mary Dennis</hi> might be produced as witne≈øs hereof, with many more. Some of Sir <hi>Edmund</hi>'s creatures have ≈øaid, that ≈øuch things as the≈øe made <hi>his government to ≈øtink.</hi> Al≈øo <hi>John Hovey</hi> and others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of ≈øu≈øtaining ten pounds damages by the extortion of officers, though never any thing (they could hear of) was charged upon them to this day, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øtoper O≈øgood</hi> complain of their being ≈øent to pri≈øon nine or ten days, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a mittimus, or any thing laid to their charge,</hi> and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they were forced to pay exce≈ø≈øive charges‚ÄîIt would fill a volume, if we ≈øhould produce and in≈øert all the <hi>affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits</hi> which do confirm the truth of the≈øe complaints.</p>
                  <p>In the time of that unhappy government, if the officers wanted money, it was but ≈øeizing and impri≈øoning the be≈øt men in the country for no fault in the world, and the greedy officers would hereby have gri≈øt to their mill. Thus was Major <hi>Appleton</hi> dealt with. Thus Captain <hi>Brad≈øtreet.</hi> Thus that worthy and wor≈øhipful gentleman <hi>Nathaniel Sal≈øtori≈øtal,</hi> E≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, was ≈øerved by them and <hi>barbarou≈øly pro≈øecuted,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any information or crime laid to his charge; for he had done nothing worthy of bonds, but it was the plea≈øure of Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> and ≈øome others, thus to abu≈øe a gentleman far more honourably de≈øcended than him≈øelf, and one concerned in the government of <hi>New-England</hi> before him, but (to his eternal renown) one who refu≈øed to <hi>accept of an illegal and arbitrary commi≈ø≈øion,</hi> when in the reign of the late king <hi>James</hi> it was offered to him.</p>
                  <p>We have now ≈øeen a whole jury of complaints which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in their verdict again≈øt Sir <hi>Edmund Andro≈ø≈øe</hi> and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates.

him. For fir≈øt, His commi≈ø≈øion was ≈øuch as would make any one believe that a courtier in the time of the late king <hi>James</hi> ≈øpoke true, who ≈øaid Sir <hi>Edmund Andro≈ø≈øe was ≈øent to</hi> New-England <hi>on purpo≈øe to be a plague to the people there.</hi> For he with three or four more, none of them cho≈øen by the people, but rather by that <hi>implacable enemy who pro≈øceuted the</hi> quo warranto's <hi>again≈øt their charters,</hi> had power given them to make laws, and rai≈øe what monies they ≈øhould think meet for the ≈øupport of their own government, and he had power him≈øelf alone to ≈øend the be≈øt and mo≈øt u≈øeful men a thou≈øand miles, (and further if he would) out of the country, and to build cities and ca≈øtles (in the air if he could) and demoli≈øh them again, and make the pur≈øes of the poor people pay for it all. Such a commi≈ø≈øion was an un≈øufferable grievance, and no hone≈øt Engli≈øhman would ever have accepted of it, or acted by it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Jealou≈øies were augumented by his involving the country in a war with the Indians, by means whereof he hath occa≈øioned the ruin of many families and plantations; yea the death or captivity of we know not how many ≈øouls. <hi>For he went (with the</hi> Ro≈øe <hi>frigate, and violently ≈øeized, and took and carried away, in a time of peace all the hou≈øhold goods and merchandi≈øes of</hi> mon≈øieur Cakeen <hi>a Frenchman at</hi> Penob≈øcot <hi>who was allied to the Indians</hi> having married the daughter of one of their <hi>princes</hi> whom they call <hi>Sagamores</hi> or <hi>Sachems;</hi> and when this was done, it was ea≈øy to fore≈øee, and was generally concluded that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> would ≈øoon be upon the Engli≈øh, as it quickly came to pa≈øs. After the flame was kindled, and barbarous outrages commited by the Indians, Sir <hi>Edmund</hi>'s managery was ≈øuch as filled the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with greater fears of an <hi>horrid de≈øign.</hi> For bloody Indians whom the Engli≈øh had ≈øecured, were not only di≈ømi≈ø≈øed, but rather courted than puni≈øhed by him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It cannot be expre≈øt what ju≈øt and amazing fears ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the people of <hi>New-England</hi> when they had notice of the late <hi>king James</hi> being in <hi>France,</hi> le≈øt Sir <hi>Edmund Andro≈ø≈øe</hi> who≈øe governor and confident he was, ≈øhould betray them into the power of the <hi>French king,</hi> other circum≈øtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to ≈øtrenghen the≈øe fears. The <hi>Mohawks</hi> and other Indians were in ho≈øtility again≈øt the <hi>French</hi> and it was very advantagious to the Engli≈øh intere≈øt to have it ≈øo, but Sir <hi>Edmund cau≈øed them to make a peace with the French,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the French intere≈øt in tho≈øe parts was ≈øtrengthened, and the Engli≈øh weakened. Mr. <hi>Peter Reverdy</hi> (a French pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtant) in his <hi>memoirs</hi> concerning Sir <hi>Edmund Andro≈ø≈øe</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="unknown:012973_0040_0F903FFC401D2CC0"/>After that Sir <hi>Edmund Andro≈ø≈øe and his accomplices</hi> were ≈øecured, ≈øuch reports and informations came to hand, as made <hi>New-England</hi> admire the divine providence in accompli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was done again≈øt the late oppre≈ø≈øors.

And the Lieutenant of a French man of war profe≈ø≈øed, that if Sir <hi>Edmund Andro≈ø≈øe</hi> had not been impri≈øoned, they would then have gone to <hi>Bo≈øton.</hi> This ≈øhews what a good opinion the French had of him, and ≈øuch reports ≈øo te≈øtified made a ≈øtrange impre≈ø≈øion on the ≈øpirits of the people throughout the country: And that the world may ≈øee we do not write fictions of our own, the ≈øub≈øequent <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidavits</hi> are produced and here in≈øerted.</p>

                  <p>And now we need no further <hi>di≈øcovery of the man.</hi> Could the people of <hi>New-England</hi> who are zealous for Engli≈øh li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties ever endure it long, that ≈øuch a per≈øon as this ≈øhould be made one of their <hi>judges,</hi> that by ≈øqueezing of them, he might be able to pay his <hi>debts?</hi> And can any rational man believe, that per≈øons of ≈øuch principles did not <hi>tyrannize</hi> over that people when once they had them in their cruel clutches, and could pretend the authority of the late king <hi>James</hi> for for what they did? in our opinion Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> hath not done like a wi≈øe man thus to expo≈øe him≈øelf to the ju≈øt re≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and indignation of all the <hi>Engli≈øh plantations.</hi> If ever it ≈øhould be his chance to be among≈øt them again, what could he expect but to be looked on as <hi>communis ho≈øtis,</hi> when he thus openly declares that they have no Engli≈øh liberties belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them? ‚Äî That worthy gentleman Sir <hi>William Jones</hi> (who was <hi>Attorney General</hi> in the reign of king <hi>Charles</hi> the ≈øecond) had certainly more under≈øtanding in the law than Captain <hi>Palmer,</hi> and yet Captain <hi>Palmer</hi> (we ≈øuppo≈øe) is not ignorant that when ≈øome propo≈øed, that <hi>Jamaica</hi> (and ≈øo the other plantations) might be governed without any a≈ø≈øembly, <hi>that excellency Attorney</hi> (not like Captain <hi>Palmer</hi> but like an Engli≈øhman) told the then king, <hi>that he could no more grant a commi≈ø≈øion to levy money <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Thus did Sir <hi>Edmund Andro≈ø≈øe</hi> and his creatures, who were deeply concerned in the illegal actions of the late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy reigns, contrary to the laws of God and men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a rape on a whole colony; for which violence it is hoped they may account, and make reparation (if po≈ø≈øible) to tho≈øe many who≈øe properties as well as liberties have been inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by them.</p>
                  <p>Captain <hi>Palmer</hi> in the clo≈øe of his <hi>partial account of New-England</hi> entertains his readers with an <hi>harangue</hi> about the <hi>≈øin of rebellion,</hi> and mi≈øapplies ≈øeveral ≈øcriptures that ≈øo he might make the world believe that the people of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have been guilty of wicked <hi>rebellion</hi> by their ca≈øting off the arbitrary power of tho≈øe ill men who invaded liberty and property to ≈øuch an intolerable degree as hath been proved again≈øt them.

But ≈øince he hath thought meet to take a ≈øpiritual weapon into his hand, let him know that the ≈øcripture ≈øpeaks of a lawful and good <hi>rebellion,</hi> as well as of that which is unlawful. It is ≈øaid of good <hi>Hezekiah that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled again≈øt the king of A≈ø≈øyria and ≈øerved him not,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.7.

It is hard to believe that Captain <hi>Palmer</hi> does not rebel again≈øt the light of his own con≈øcience, when he affirms as in page 38, that in <hi>New-England, every thing that hath any relation to their maje≈øties is neglected and unregarded, without any recognition of their authority over tho≈øe dominions.</hi> He cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the humble <hi>addre≈ø≈øes</hi> which the people in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have from time to time made to their pre≈øent maje≈øties, acknowledging their authority. He knows that on the fir≈øt notice of their maje≈øties being proclaimed <hi>king</hi> and <hi>queen</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> both tho≈øe now in government in <hi>New-England,</hi> and the body of the people with them, did (without any command) of their own accord, with the greate≈øt joy proclaim their maje≈øties in <hi>New-England.</hi> He knows that their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øties have no ≈øubjects more cordialy and zealou≈øly devoted to them than tho≈øe in <hi>New-England</hi> are, or that do with greater fervor pray for their long and happy reigns, or that are more willing to expo≈øe them≈øelves to the utmo≈øt hazards in their ≈øervice, and yet this man that knoweth all this, to ca≈øt an <hi>odium</hi> on that loyal and good people, in≈øinuates as if they were <hi>rebels,</hi> and <hi>di≈øaffected</hi> to the pre≈øent government, and de≈øigned to ≈øet up an <hi>independent common wealth,</hi> and had <hi>no regard to the laws of God or men.</hi> After this lying and malicious rate hath he expre≈ø≈øed him≈øelf.

When <hi>Sanballat</hi> wrote that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and the Jews with him <hi>intended to rebel,</hi> did he believe what he had written? no, he did not, but <hi>feigned tho≈øe things out of his own heart.</hi> The like is to be ≈øaid of tho≈øe <hi>Sanballats</hi> that accu≈øe the people

                     <hi>Government,</hi> we would give ≈øome information of the <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and male-admini≈øtrations</hi> under the ≈øame. Upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration had thereof, and in an≈øwer thereunto, we cannot but own and declare, that <hi>not only our≈øelves and many others in the ≈øame ≈øtation</hi> (not now pre≈øent to join with us) were of a long time much <hi>di≈ø≈øati≈øfied and di≈øcouraged with very many of the proceedings and admini≈øtrations in the ≈øaid government;</hi> and had little rea≈øon to wonder that ≈øo great a number of the people were ≈øo too. It might well have been expected that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor (not ≈øo ≈øucce≈øsful heretofore) notwith≈øtanding the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarine≈øs (to ≈øay no more) of many clau≈øes and powers in his commi≈ø≈øion; yea the rather and the more, becau≈øe thereof would have cautioned and moderated the execution of the ≈øame: But to our great trouble we found it very much otherwi≈øe. Many were the things that were account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed irregular and grievous therein, far from conducing to the public weal of the territory, and not a little to the di≈ø≈øervice of the crown, as tending rather to the di≈øturbing and di≈øaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the ≈øubjects here, than to the furtherance of that chearful obedience, loyalty, love and duty in them, which ought by all good means, to have been nouri≈øhed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted. And of all this unhappine≈øs, we mu≈øt reckon the fir≈øt ≈øtep and in-let to be that <hi>the governor did</hi> ≈øo quickly neglect the great number of the council, and <hi>chiefly adhere unto and govern by the advice</hi> only of a few others, the principal <hi>of them ≈øtrangers to the country, without e≈øtates or intere≈øt therein to oblige them, per≈øons of known and declared prejudices again≈øt us, and that had plainly laid their chiefe≈øt de≈øigns and hopes to make unrea≈øonable profit of this poor people.</hi> Innumerable were the evil effects that from hence were continually growing up among≈øt us; <hi>the debates in council were not ≈øo free as ought to have been,</hi> but too much over-ruled, and a great deal of har≈øhne≈øs continually expre≈ø≈øed again≈øt per≈øons and opinions that did not plea≈øe. <hi>The greate≈øt rigour and ≈øeverity was too often u≈øed towards the ≈øobere≈øt ≈øort of people,</hi> when any thing could be found or pretended again≈øt them, their humble ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øions were little regarded, and <hi>inexorable per≈øecutions order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again≈øt them,</hi> whil≈øt in the mean time <hi>the notorious viciou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and profanene≈øs of others met not with</hi> the like <hi>di≈øcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> but per≈øons of ≈øuch a character were put into places of bu≈øine≈øs and tru≈øt. The long ≈øettled maintenance of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick mini≈øtry, even from tho≈øe that applied them≈øelves to no other way of wor≈øhip, but continued ordinary hearers, could not be upheld by any act of authority providing for the ≈øame, and ≈øchools of learning ≈øo well taken care of formerly, were
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:012973_0052_0F904007F3F12A38"/>
in mo≈øt places fallen to decay, and many more ≈øuch like might be reckoned up. But we ≈øhall more e≈øpecially in≈øtance fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the particulars following, as not the lea≈øt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was as we thought a great ≈ølight put upon the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and to the prejudice of the good people of the territory, that whereas at the governor's fir≈øt coming a committee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thereunto by him≈øelf, and a full council had with great care and ≈øeveral weeks trouble revi≈øed a very con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of orders and laws collected out of the ≈øeveral law-books of the≈øe colonies found by long experience very needful and agreeable to the good of the≈øe plantations, which laws ≈øo collected and revi≈øed, were again pre≈øented unto, and upon further advi≈øement approved by the governor and council and pa≈ø≈øed. Yet upon the introducing Mr. <hi>We≈øt</hi> from <hi>New-York</hi> to be deputy ≈øecretary, they were, for what cau≈øes we know not, totally laid a≈øide, and the people denied the benefit of them. And this grievance was ≈øo much the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and a plainer indication of the ≈øeverity of ≈øome men in their intended management of things, becau≈øe on good deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration they had al≈øo pa≈ø≈øed an order of council, that until the council ≈øhould take further order, the ≈øeveral ju≈øtices, town-officers, and others ≈øhould proceed according to former u≈øages, and ≈øuch local laws in the ≈øeveral parts of this domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as are not repugnant to the laws of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> Yet becau≈øe by virtue of the ≈øaid order ≈øome in authority have proceeded to put forth their power for the ≈øupport of the mini≈øtry, and ≈øome others did ju≈øtify them≈øelves in ≈øome actions done by them that were not plea≈øing; hereupon when a di≈øcour≈øe only, and ≈øome debate thereof had pa≈ø≈øed in council, but <hi>without any regular determination made,</hi> and contrary to the expre≈øs word of the ≈øaid order, <hi>it was entered in the council-book</hi> concerning it, re≈øolved that the ≈øame was only in force till the next ≈øe≈ø≈øion of the council, and ≈øo deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined as null of it≈øelf, and that none pre≈øume to act pur≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to ≈øuch laws as are or ≈øhall be made here.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Whereas</hi> the act for the continuing and e≈øtabli≈øhing of ≈øeveral rates, duties and impo≈øts, was one of the fir≈øt of ≈øo great moment that came out in a form under the ≈øeal of the territory, and was publickly proclaimed, we that were pre≈øent have great cau≈øe to remember what trouble and di≈ø≈øatisfaction there was among the members of the council concerning the ≈øame. As that act was framed and urged upon us, <hi>a very con≈øiderable number (and we believe we were
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:012973_0053_0F9040095125E480"/>
the major part) di≈ø≈øented</hi> from and argued much again≈øt it. And though the governor expre≈ø≈øed not a little heat and po≈øitivene≈øs alledging his in≈øtructions, and held the council together, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea≈øonably a very long time about it. Yet when we did at la≈øt break up we could not imagine that he could take the bill to be agreed to; <hi>neverthele≈øs it was the next day (to our wonderment) brought in fairly engro≈ø≈øed in parchment, and quickly ≈øigned by the governor without any counting of voices</hi> either then or the day before, which was the more needful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe ≈øome did continue ≈øtill to make their objections, others that had ≈øpoken again≈øt the bill the day before, declaring their adherence to what they had then ≈øaid; and many more under ≈øo great di≈øcouragement and di≈øcountenance, as was manife≈øted ≈øitting ≈øilent, which we are ≈øure in the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar pa≈ø≈øing of laws can never be reckoned for a con≈øent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The way</hi> and manner u≈øed afterwards of propo≈øing and pa≈ø≈øing all laws was very uncertain and unequal, not an≈øwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the nature of ≈øo great a power, nor to the largene≈øs of the territory that was to be obliged by them, or to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the councellors appointed therein; for after a little while there were no ≈øet times appointed or given notice of for the making of laws, that ≈øo the members of the council might attend in a fuller number to be helpful therein. Bills of the greate≈øt concernment were u≈øually fir≈øt con≈øulted and framed in private, and ≈øo unexpectedly brought into council at any time, and then our work too was often under great di≈øad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, not to advi≈øe freely and con≈øult about the making of a law thought nece≈ø≈øary, but to maintain a conte≈øt in oppo≈øition to a very inconvenient one, too far promoted and engaged in already; and above all, <hi>there was never any fair way of taking and counting the number of the councellors con≈øenting and di≈ø≈øenting,</hi> that ≈øo the majority might be known in any matter that admitted of any con≈øiderable rea≈øonings and debates, by rea≈øon whereof both laws and other orders and re≈øolutions might be ≈øet down as pa≈ø≈øed by the council, which ought not to have been. And when it hath been (as often it was) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øly and earne≈øtly prayed when matters of greater moment than ordinary were in hand, that the debate and re≈øolution of them might be put off till a fuller council of members from other ≈øeveral parts of the dominion might be convened ≈øuch motions were ever di≈øaccepted, and entertained with no little di≈øplacency; <hi>≈øo that it might be too truly affirmed, that in effect four or five per≈øons, and tho≈øe not ≈øo favourably inclined and di≈øpo≈øed as were to be wi≈øhed for, bear the rule over, and
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:012973_0054_0F90400A70D5ADB0"/>
gave law to a territory the large≈øt and mo≈øt con≈øiderable of any belonging to the dominion of the crown.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>In pur≈øuance</hi> of this way and manner of pa≈ø≈øing laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove expre≈ø≈øed, there were two in ≈øpecial that came forth, which we are ≈øure in fuller and freer councils would have had a full ≈øtop put to them; <hi>viz. Fir≈øt,</hi> The act for regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the choice of ≈øelect-men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein the liberty of towns to meet for the managing of their publick affairs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to their common lands, and all other their concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which they had enjoyed for ≈øo many years, to their great benefit, was mo≈øt unrea≈øonably re≈øtrained to once a year, and all other convening of inhabitants as a town meeting, upon any pretence or colour what≈øoever, was ≈øtrictly forbidden: And the other act was that intituled, an act requiring all ma≈øters of ≈øhips or ve≈ø≈øels to give ≈øecurity, in which there were ≈øuch re≈øtraints laid upon all per≈øons from tran≈øporting them≈øelves freely (as their occa≈øion might call) out of their territory, that it would have been a meer pri≈øon to all that ≈øhould be found therein, and ≈øuch bond required of all ≈øhips and ve≈ø≈øels (extending in the practice even to ≈øhallops and wood-boats) as would quickly have intolerably di≈øcouraged, if not ruined the trade thereof; and all without any other ordinary gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral benefit of the ≈øaid act, but the filling ≈øome men's poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets with fees: And (as it might be thought from the time of moving this act, which was when Captain <hi>Hutchin≈øon</hi> was already gone, and Mr. <hi>Mather was known to be intending for</hi> England) <hi>the ob≈øtructing of ≈øuch men's going home as were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there to make ju≈øt complaints, and ≈øeek redre≈øs of publick grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances;</hi> and when this act had been ≈øtrenuou≈øly oppo≈øed in council here at <hi>Bo≈øton,</hi> where it was more than once vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently urged, and as often denied, <hi>it was carried as far as</hi> New York, <hi>and there an opportunity found for the obtaining of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>The</hi> great matter of properties and titles to our lands is the next to be in≈øi≈øted on, his maje≈øty that granted the charter did fully inve≈øt the patentees with right to the ≈øoil through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole limits thereof, and here on the place, the right of the natives was hone≈øtly purcha≈øed from them. The di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øal, di≈øtribution, and granting of lands by the patentees, who were al≈øo incorporated, and made a body politick, was in ≈øuch a plain, ready, ea≈øy way, without any charge to the planters, as in the ≈øettlement of ≈øo large a country was thought to be mo≈øt agreeable: And ≈øo much of a publick
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:012973_0055_0F90400A9719C5C8"/>
≈øpirit and de≈øign were tho≈øe noble gentlemen, that (though well they might) they ≈øettled not one ≈øingle penny of ≈øervice or acknowledgment to them≈øelves and heirs of any of their grants, a thing ≈øo ≈øelf-denying and worthy, that few in≈øtances can be given of the like. All which notwith≈øtanding, and the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, de≈øcents and valuable purcha≈øes of ≈øo many years that have pa≈ø≈øed ≈øince, <hi>the governor and tho≈øe he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to re≈øolved and practi≈øed to make all men's titles in effect quite null and void.</hi> The purcha≈øing of the natives right, was made nothing of, and next to a ridicule. The enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and improvement of lands not inclo≈øed, and e≈øpecially if lying in common among≈øt many was denied to be po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øion; it was not enough that ≈øome men that thought it convenient, and were both willing and able, did take confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of their lands, the numbers of whom in time might have been a con≈øiderable gain to them; but <hi>nothing would ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy unle≈øs all in general might be compelled ≈øo to do; hence tho≈øe that refu≈øed were declared intruders upon his maje≈øty, and put in fear of having their lands granted unto ≈øtrangers.</hi> Many were ≈øolicited, and encouraged to petition for other men's lands, and had a ≈øhameful example ≈øet them by ≈øome of the chief contrivers of all this mi≈øchief. <hi>When ≈øome men have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned for a confirmation of their own lands, a part of the≈øe only was offered to be granted to them, and another part denied.</hi> Nor could any man's own land be confirmed to him, without a particular ≈øurvey of every part and parcel of them fir≈øt made, the great charges whereof, and of other fees to be taken would have been to mo≈øt men in≈øupportable: <hi>Yea it hath by ≈øome been computed that all the money in the country would not ≈øuffice to patent the lands therein contained.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And yet further,</hi> a con≈øiderable quit-rent to the king was to be impo≈øed upon all lands, though already a con≈øtant yearly tax for the ≈øupport of the government had been laid on them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And for</hi> all this mo≈øt unrea≈øonable vexation to a laborious and indu≈øtrious people, the only ground pretended was ≈øome defects and wants of form and due manner alledged to be in the way of the di≈øpo≈øing and conveying of all lands from the patentees to the town≈øhips and people here; which whatever it amounted to might have been ea≈øily remedied, either by an application and repre≈øentation to the king for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a general ≈øettlement of all properties (which would have been highly worthy and generous for the governor to have engaged in, on behalf of the people) or by ≈øome other ways
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:012973_0056_0F90400B4F3B94F8"/>
that were propo≈øed. But nothing but the way of particular patenting as above≈øaid could prevail. In pro≈øecution where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all actions intended upon informations of intru≈øions in his maje≈øty's behalf, or between old proprietors and new grantees mu≈øt have had their deci≈øion at the ordinary courts of common law here upon the place where matters of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and of a con≈øideration tran≈øcending all ordinary ca≈øes could not have a proper cognizance and due influence in the deci≈øion, determination and judgment.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Though</hi> ≈øufficient courts of ju≈øtice were appointed, and held in the ≈øeveral counties for the trial of all offenders, yet it <hi>was too frequent upon more particular di≈øplea≈øure to fetch up per≈øons from very remote counties before the governor and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at Bo≈øton</hi> (who were the highe≈øt, and a con≈øtant court of record and judicature) not to receive their tryal but only to be examined there, and ≈øo remitted to an inferior court to be farther proceeded again≈øt. <hi>The grievance of which court was exceeding great,</hi> for hereby not only the charge was made exce≈ø≈øive upon ≈øuch per≈øons by the <hi>notorious exactions of the me≈ø≈øenger,</hi> the ≈øecretary's fees for examination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the≈øe examinations them≈øelves were unrea≈øonably ≈øtrict, and rigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and very unduly di≈øparing to plain unexperienced men. <hi>And</hi> the trials of ≈øeveral, were by this means over-ruled to be at <hi>Bo≈øton,</hi> and not in the proper counties, and were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe ≈øo far prejudged as to be rendered le≈øs equal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> extraordinary oppre≈ø≈øive fees taken in all matters by indigent and exacting officers, the≈øe were at the fir≈øt for a long time arbitrarily impo≈øed and required without any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of an e≈øtabli≈øhment of them by the council. Afterwards a committee was appointed, to bring in a table of fees, that ≈øpent a long time without fini≈øhing any thing, the rea≈øon whereof was becau≈øe ≈øome therein <hi>e≈øpecially the deputy ≈øecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary We≈øt,</hi> in≈øi≈øted upon fees much more extraordinary than ≈øome others could con≈øent to. In conclu≈øion; there was a table of fees drawn up to be pre≈øented to the council, and ≈øigned by ≈øome of the committee, one of whom, (who≈øe ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription is to this paper) declaring expre≈øly, that by his ≈øigning he did no otherwi≈øe agree, but only that it might be pre≈øented to the council, to do therein as they ≈øhould ≈øee cau≈øe, who al≈øo when it was ≈øo pre≈øented to the council, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that many of the particulars in that table contained, were unrea≈øonable, and ought to be abated, and of this mind
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:012973_0057_0F90400C9F2528E8"/>
were many others. But the entry after the u≈øual manner was an approbation thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>La≈øtly.</hi> As to tho≈øe <hi>great jealou≈øies and ≈øu≈øpicions of ≈øini≈øter de≈øigns in the governor as to our troubles by the Indians,</hi> we have to ≈øay, That although divers things too uncertain, if not untrue have been too ea≈øily reported and ≈øpread concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, a practice which ≈øome of us have formerly with no little prejudice to our≈øelves di≈øcountenanced and borne te≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony again≈øt; yet <hi>there have not wanted ≈øome other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars that might give too great a ground for the ≈øame.</hi> The principal of them (as far as we have any knowledge of things of that kind) are the≈øe.</p>
                  <p>The governor's <hi>≈øeizing and taking away the goods of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur St.</hi> Ca≈øtine <hi>of</hi> Penop≈øcot, the ≈øummer before the war broke forth, which thing hath been e≈øteemed not a little to have ≈øtirred up and furthered the ≈øucceeding troubles. The governor's not ha≈øtening his return to <hi>Bo≈øton</hi> when the≈øe troubles were actually begun, but lengthening out his tarrience in places ≈øo remote till the ho≈øtility of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and the great mi≈øchiefs thereof were too far advanced. That during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence he was not plea≈øed ≈øufficiently to impower and in≈øtruct any to act things nece≈ø≈øary for the ≈øafety of the out plantations and the pro≈øecution and ≈øuppre≈ø≈øion of the enemy, tho' he had ≈øpeedy and true accounts from time to time ≈øent him of all that happened. That all that was done to this purpo≈øe in a ca≈øe of ≈øuch nece≈ø≈øity, either by the lieutenant governor, or by the ju≈øtices of the peace, and military officers in many places, by ≈øecuring and di≈øarming of neighbouring <hi>Indians,</hi> ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up, warding and watching, garri≈øoning ≈øeveral hou≈øes for the ≈øecurity of the inhabitants, e≈øpecially the women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in ca≈øe of ≈øudden inroads and ≈øurprizings that might be, ≈øending ≈øome relief of men to ≈øome places that were mo≈øt in danger, and al≈øo what was done by tho≈øe members of the council that were at <hi>Bo≈øton</hi> in conjunction with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief left in the ≈øort there, who rai≈øed and ≈øent ≈øome forces to <hi>Ca≈øco-Bay,</hi> where greate≈øt harms were done. We ≈øay, that all that was thus done, was ≈øo extreamly di≈øapprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by the governor upon his return back from <hi>Albany</hi> and <hi>New-York,</hi> and an unaccountable di≈øplea≈øure manife≈øted again≈øt all per≈øons that had ≈øo acted, and that he was ready to call them to an account as high offenders for the ≈øame, and refu≈øed a long time, though much ≈øolicited, to give any order concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ≈øoldiers ≈øent to <hi>Ca≈øco,</hi> either for the continuance of them there, where they were very nece≈ø≈øary, or for their di≈ømi≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

home. Unto all which may be added the governor's ≈øending me≈ø≈øengers both <hi>John Smith</hi> the quaker from <hi>Albany,</hi> and ≈øoon after Major <hi>Macgregory</hi> to <hi>Keybeck</hi> upon ≈øuch errands and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈øs as were not communicated and laid open to the council. And further, <hi>his relea≈øe and ≈øetting at liberty ≈øundry</hi> Indians <hi>that were in hold, ≈øome of them known enemies to the</hi> Engli≈øh, and particularly objected again≈øt by ≈øeveral of the council, and that without any exchange of our <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> captives then in the enemies hands.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe are the chief matters which upon this occa≈øion (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any undue prejudice again≈øt any man, or de≈øign to ju≈øtify the defects of our≈øelves in the performance of our own ≈øhares of duty, but in an≈øwer to the de≈øire ≈øignified to us as above) we have to ≈øet forth, profe≈ø≈øing truly that by ≈øuch a ≈øtate of things as we had the experience and feeling of, the places that we held were rendered exceeding unea≈øy to us, and that out of a ≈øincere re≈øpect to the pro≈øperity of the≈øe their maje≈øties plantations, we could not but be very de≈øirous that through the favour of God and our ≈øuperiors, all due redre≈øs might in a good happy ≈øea≈øon be obtained; and the way of governing <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> ≈øubjects in their maje≈øties dominions without an a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembly of the people's repre≈øentatives bani≈øhed out of the world for ever.</p>
