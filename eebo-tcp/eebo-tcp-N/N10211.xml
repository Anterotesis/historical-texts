            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT is not with any deſign or deſire unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to expoſe the late oppreſſors of that good proteſtant people which is in <hi>New-England,</hi> that the authors of the enſuing <hi>vindication</hi> have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed what is herewith emitted. But the <hi>agents</hi> lately ſent from thence could not be faithful to their truſt, if when the people whom they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent are publicly (as well as privately) <hi>aſperſed,</hi> they ſhould not (either by themſelves, or by furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome other with materials for ſuch an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking) <hi>vindicate</hi> thoſe who have been ſo deeply injured.</p>
            <p>As for Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> his account, which he calls <hi>impartial,</hi> he has wronged <hi>New-England</hi> thereby, in ſome other particulars beſides thoſe inſiſted on, in the ſubſequent <hi>apology.</hi> For he does en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012973_0003_0F903FD788328A90"/>
to make the world believe that the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> refuſed to anſwer to the <hi>quo-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto</hi> proſecuted againſt their <hi>charter:</hi> Than which miſrepreſentation nothing can be more untrue or injurious. An account concerning that matter hath formerly (and more than once) been made public, in the which it is moſt truly affirmed, <q>That when the <hi>quo-warranto</hi> was iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out againſt the governor and company of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> colony in <hi>New-England</hi> in the year 1683, the then king did by his decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration enjoin a few particular perſons to make their defence at their own charge, without any public ſtock; which ſhewed that there was a reſolution to take away that charter: yet the governor and company appointed an attorney to anſwer to the <hi>quo warranto;</hi> but the ſuit was let fall in the court of <hi>king's-bench,</hi> and a new ſuit began by <hi>ſcire facias</hi> in court of <hi>chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> where time was not allowed to make defence. The former attorney for that colony brought ſeveral merchants to teſtify that in the time allowed (which was from <hi>April</hi> 16, till <hi>June</hi> 18) in was impoſſible to have a new let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of attorney returned from <hi>New-England.</hi> The then lord keeper <hi>North</hi> replied, that no time ought to be given. So was judgment entered againſt them before they could poſſibly plead for themſelves.</q> By this the impartial reader may judge what ingenuity and veracity is in Mr. <hi>Palmer's</hi> account.</p>
            <p>There is lately come forth another <hi>ſcandalous pamphlet,</hi> called <hi>New-England's faction diſcovered.</hi> The author has not put his name to it: But it is ſuppoſed to be written by a certain perſon
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012973_0004_0F903FD8CFEAD440"/>
known to be a prodigy for impudence and lying. The reflection in it not only on <hi>New-England</hi> in general, but on particular perſons there as well as in <hi>England,</hi> are ſo notoriouſly and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly falſe, as that it muſt needs be much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath a great mind to take notice of ſuch <hi>latra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> or to anſwer them any otherwiſe than with contempt. When we are treated with the buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonry and railery of ſuch ungenteel pens, it is good to remember the old ſaying, <hi>mognum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliae remedium, negligentia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for what Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> does in his preface inſinuate concerning the <hi>New-Englanders</hi> being <hi>common-wealths-men, enemies to monarchy, and to the church of England,</hi> that is ſuch a <hi>ſham</hi> as every one ſees through it.</p>
            <p>There are none in the world that do more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concur with the <hi>doctrine</hi> of the church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> contained in the 39 articles, than do <hi>the churches in New-England,</hi> as is manifeſt from the confeſſion of their faith publiſhed in the year 1680. Only as to <hi>liturgy and ceremonies</hi> they differ; for which cauſe alone it was that they, or their fathers, tranſported themſelves into that <hi>American deſert,</hi> as being deſirous to worſhip God in that way which they thought was moſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſcriptures. The <hi>platform of church diſcipline</hi> conſented unto by the elders and meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of the churches aſſembled in a general ſynod at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> in the year 1647, ſheweth that they are as to <hi>church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for the <hi>congregational way.</hi> The judiciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned Mr. <hi>Philip Nye</hi> has long ſince evinced that no form of church-government (no not that which is epiſcopal) is more conſiſtent with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012973_0005_0F903FD9073179F8"/>
or with the king's ſupremacy, than that of the <hi>way-congregational,</hi> which ſome will needs call <hi>independent.</hi> But there are a ſort of men, who call thoſe that are for <hi>Engliſh</hi> liberties, and that rejoice in the government of their preſent majeſties, king <hi>William</hi> and queen <hi>Mary,</hi> by the name of <hi>republicans,</hi> and repreſent all ſuch as enemies of monarchy and of the church. It is not our ſingle opinion only, but we can ſpeak it on the behalf of the generality of their majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſubjects in <hi>New-England,</hi> that they believe (without any diminution to the glory of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer princes) the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation was never ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in a <hi>king,</hi> or in a <hi>queen,</hi> as at this day. And the God of heaven, who has ſet them on the throne of theſe kingdoms, grant them long and proſperouſly to reign.</p>

                  <head>THE REVOLUTION IN NEW-ENGLAND JUSTIFIED.</head>
                  <p>THE doctrine of <hi>paſſive obedience</hi> and <hi>non-reſiſtance,</hi> which a ſort of men did of late, when they thought the world would never change, cry up as divine truth, is by means of the happy <hi>revolution</hi> in theſe nations, exploded, and the aſſertors of it become ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>No man does really approve of the <hi>revolution</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> but muſt juſtify that in <hi>New-England</hi> alſo; for the latter was effected in compliance with the former, neither was there any deſign among the <hi>people in New-England</hi> to reaſſume their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>charter-government,</hi> until his preſent majeſty's intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſcent into <hi>England,</hi> to reſcue the nation from <hi>ſlavery</hi> as well as <hi>popery,</hi> was known to them (for indeed to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted it before that would have been madneſs.) They
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012973_0007_0F903FDA86D5ADF8"/>
conſidered that the men then uſurping government in <hi>New-England</hi> were king <hi>James</hi>'s creatures, who had invaded both the <hi>liberty and property of Engliſh proteſtants</hi> after ſuch a manner as perhaps the like was never known in any part of the world where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation has any government; and the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> which they had obtained from the late king <hi>James</hi> was more illegal and arbitrary, than that granted to <hi>Dudley</hi> and <hi>Empſon</hi> by king <hi>Henry</hi> 7th. Or than it may be was ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given to any by king <hi>James</hi> himſelf, or by any one that ever ſwayed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſcepter, which was a grievance into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable; and yet they deſired not to make themſelves judges in a caſe which ſo nearly concerned them, but inſtead of harſher treatment of thoſe who had tyrannized over them, they only ſecured them that they might not betray that country into the hands of <hi>the late king,</hi> or of king <hi>Lewis,</hi> which they had reaſon enough to believe (conſidering their characters and diſpoſitions) they were inclined to do. They deſigned not to revenge themſelves on their enemies, which they could as eaſily have done as a thouſand men are able to kill one, and therefore when they ſecured their perſons, they declared (as in their <hi>declaration</hi> printed at <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is to be ſeen) that they would <hi>leave it to the king and parliament of</hi> England, <hi>to inflict what puniſhment they ſhould think meet for ſuch criminals.</hi> Their ſeizing and ſecuring the governor, was no more than was done in <hi>England,</hi> at <hi>Hull, Dover, Plymouth, &amp;c.</hi> that ſuch a man as Mr. <hi>John Palmer</hi> ſhould exclaim againſt it, is not to be wondered at, ſeeing he was one of the governor's tools, being of his council, made a judge by him, and too much concerned in ſome illegal and arbitrary proceedings; but his confidence is wonderful, that he ſhould publiſh in print that neither himſelf nor ſir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Androſſe,</hi> nor others of them who had been ſecured by the people in <hi>New-England, had any crimes laid to their charge,</hi> whereas the foreſaid declaration emitted the very day they were ſecured, doth plainly ſet forth their crimes. And in the preface of his book he hath theſe words; viz.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>We appeared at the council-board where the worſt of our enemies, even the very men who had ſo unjuſtly impriſoned and detained us, had nothing to ſay or object againſt us.</q>—</p>
                  <p>By theſe enemies he ſpeaks of, we ſuppoſe he means thoſe who were lately ſent as <hi>agents</hi> from <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>New-England;</hi> he hath therefore neceſſitated us to inform the world, that the following objections (though not by his enemies, yet) by thoſe <hi>agents</hi> preſented at the council-board.</p>

                              <p n="2">2. That in the time of his government, he without form or colour of legal authority made laws deſtructive of the liberty of the people, impoſed and levied taxes, threatened and impriſoned them that would not be aſſiſting to the illegal levies, denied that they had any property in their lands without patents from him, and during the time of actual war with the <hi>Indians,</hi> he did ſupply them with amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and ſeveral <hi>Indians</hi> declared, that they were incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by him to make war upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced making defence againſt the <hi>Indians.</hi>

                              <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="1">1.

of Mr. <hi>John Winſlow,</hi> who affirms that being in <hi>Nevis</hi> in <hi>February</hi> 1688, a ſhip arrived there from <hi>England</hi> with <hi>the prince of Orange's</hi> declaration, and intelligence of the happy change of affairs in <hi>England,</hi> which he knew would be <hi>wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come news in New-England,</hi> and therefore was at the charge to procure a written copy of that princely declaration with which he arrived at <hi>Boſton</hi> about a fortnight before the <hi>revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> there. He concealed the declaration, from Sir <hi>Edmund,</hi> becauſe he believed if it came into his poſſeſſion, he would keep the people in ignorance concerning it; but intimation being given that Mr. <hi>Winſlow</hi> had brought with him the declaration, he was therefore committed to priſon (though he offered two thouſand pounds bail) for bringing into the country <hi>a treaſonable paper.</hi> For the ſatisfaction of ſuch as are willing to be informed in this matter, Mr. <hi>Winſlow</hi>'s teſtimony as it was given upon oath before a magiſtrate in <hi>New-England</hi> ſhall be here inſerted.

He told me I was a ſaucy fellow, and bid the ſheriff carry me away to the juſtices of the peace, and as we were going, I told the ſheriff, I would chooſe my juſtice, he told me, no, I muſt go before doctor <hi>Bullivant,

                  <p>By theſe things it appears that it was abſolutely neceſſary for the people in <hi>New-England</hi> to ſeize Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe</hi> and his accomplices, that ſo they might ſecure that territory for their preſent majeſties king <hi>William</hi> and queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe,</hi> &amp;c. did <hi>make laws deſtructive to the liberty of the ſubjects,</hi> is notoriouſly known, for they made what laws they pleaſed <hi>without any conſent of the people, either by themſelves or repreſentatives,</hi> which is indeed to <hi>deſtroy the fundamentals of the Engliſh</hi> and to <hi>erect a French government.</hi> We cannot learn that the like was ever practiſed in any place where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are planters, but only where Sir <hi>Edmund An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſſe</hi> hath been governor: For whereas in <hi>New-England</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant uſage under their charter government, the inhabitants of each town did aſſemble as occaſion offered to conſider of what might conduce to the welfare of their reſpective towns, the relief of the poor, or the like, Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe, with a few of his council,</hi> made a law prohibiting any town-meeting except once a year, <hi>viz.</hi> on the third Monday in <hi>May.</hi> The inhabitants of the country were ſtartled at this law, as being apprehenſive the deſign of it was to prevent the people in every town from meeting to make complaints of their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances. And whereas by conſtant uſage any perſon might remove out of the country at his pleaſure, a law was made that no man ſhould do ſo without the governor's leave. And all fiſhing boats, coaſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were to enter into a thouſand pounds bond, whereby fees were raiſed for himſelf and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. This law could not paſs at <hi>Boſton,</hi> becauſe many of Sir <hi>Edmund</hi>'s council there oppoſed it; but then a <hi>juncto</hi> of them meeting at <hi>New-York,</hi> paſſed it; and after that law was made, how ſhould any diſſatisfied perſons ever obtain
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012973_0012_0F903FDFC4A3E978"/>
liberty to go for <hi>England</hi> to complain of their being oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>arbitrary governors?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. But beſides all this, they made laws for the <hi>levying monies without the conſent of the people either by themſelves or by an aſſembly;</hi> for in order to the ſupporting their own go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they did by an act bearing date <hi>March</hi> 3, 1686, raiſe conſiderable ſums of money on the king's ſubjects in that part of his dominions, <hi>viz.</hi> a penny in the pound on all eſtates perſonal or real, twenty pence <hi>per</hi> head as poll mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, a penny in the pound for goods imported, beſides an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe on wine, rum and other liquors.</p>
                  <p>It hath indeed been pleaded that all this was but what the laws of the country before the change of the government did allow. But this is vainly pretended, for there was no ſuch law in force at the time when theſe ſums were levied, the former laws which did authorize it, were repealed <hi>October</hi> 10, 1683, ſome years before Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe</hi> and his accomplices had invaded the rights and liberties of the people there. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, in thoſe parts of the country where there were never any ſuch laws in force, particularly in <hi>Plymouth</hi> colony, this money was levied, which they heavily complained of. Yet further, in another act dated <hi>Feb.</hi> 15, 1687, they did without any colour of ancient law make an additional du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of impoſt and exciſe, which raiſed the duty, ſome ten ſhillings, ſome twenty ſhillings <hi>per</hi> pipe on wines, and ſo on other things. Nay they levied monies on <hi>Connecticut</hi> colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny contrary to their charter, which was never vacated, than which nothing more illegal and arbitrary could have been perpetrated by them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They did not only act according to theſe illegal taxes, but they did <hi>inflict ſevere puniſhment on thoſe true Engliſh men who did oppoſe their arbitrary proceedings,</hi> as ſhall be made to appear in many inſtances. When the inhabitants of <hi>Ipſwich</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> were required to chooſe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner to tax that town, ſome principal perſons there that could not comply with what was demanded of them, did modeſtly give their reaſons, for which they were committed to goal, as guilty of high miſdemeanours, and denied an <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beus corpus,</hi> and were obliged to anſwer it at a court of <hi>oyer</hi> and <hi>terminer</hi> at <hi>Boſton.</hi> And that they might be ſure to be found guilty, <hi>jurors</hi> were picked of ſuch as were no freehol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, nay of ſtrangers; the priſoners pleading <hi>the privilege of Engliſhmen</hi> not to be taxed without their own conſent, they were told that <hi>the laws of</hi> England <hi>would not follow them to the end of the earth,</hi> they meant the privileges of the Engliſh law, for the penalties they reſolved ſhould follow
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012973_0013_0F903FE0F7B0A338"/>
them <hi>quo jure quâque injuriâ.</hi> And why ſhould they inſiſt on, and talk of the privileges of Engliſhmen, when it had been declared in the governor's council, <hi>that the king's ſubjects in</hi> New-England <hi>did not differ much from ſlaves, and that the only difference was, that they were not bought and ſold?</hi> But to go on with the matter before us; in as much as the priſoners mentioned had aſſerted their <hi>Engliſh</hi> liberties, they were ſeverely handled, not only impriſoned for ſeveral weeks, but fined and bound to their good behaviour; Mr. <hi>John Wiſe</hi> was fined fifty pounds beſides coſts of court, deprived of the means of his ſubſiſtance, and gave a thouſand pounds bond for good behavior. And Mr. <hi>John Appleton</hi> was fined fifty pounds and to give a thouſand pounds bond for good behavior, and moreover declared incapable to bear office, beſides unreaſonable fees. After the ſame manner did they proceed with ſeveral others belonging to <hi>Ipſwich.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the towns men of <hi>Rowley, Saliſbury, Andover,</hi> &amp;c. had the ſame meaſure. And the king's ſubjects were not only oppreſſed thus in the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> colony, but in <hi>Plymouth.</hi> For when <hi>Shadrach Wild boar</hi> the town-clerk of <hi>Taunton</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> did, with the conſent of the town, ſign a modeſt paper ſignifying their not being free to raiſe money on the inhabitants without their own conſent by an aſſembly, the honeſt man was for this committed cloſe priſoner, and after that puniſhed with a fine of twenty marks and three months impriſonment, and bound to find ſureties by recognizance to appear the next court, and to be of the good behaviour. As to the matter of fact, the perſons concerned in <hi>theſe ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and arbitrary judgments</hi> will not have the face to deny them; if they do, there are <hi>affidavits</hi> now in <hi>London</hi> which will evince what hath been related when ever there ſhall be occaſion for it.</p>
                  <p>It is a vanity in Mr. <hi>Palmer,</hi> to think that he hath anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this by affirming, but not proving, that the <hi>Ipſwich men</hi> aſſembled themſelves in a <hi>riotous manner;</hi> for that ſaying of his is very falſe. The world knows that <hi>New-England</hi> is not the only place where honeſt men have in theſe late days been proceeded againſt as guilty of <hi>riots,</hi> when they never deſerved ſuch a cenſure any more than theſe accuſed by Mr. <hi>Palmer.</hi> But the truth of what hath been thus far related is confirmed by the following <hi>affidavits.</hi>

                              <p>Being called by thoſe in preſent authority to give my teſtimony to the diſcourſe between Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe</hi> and myſelf, when he came from the Indian war, as he paſſed through <hi>Salem</hi> going for <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>March</hi> 1688-9, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refuſe it, and therefore declare as followeth, what was the ſubſtance of that diſcourſe. Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe</hi> then governor being acompanied with the attorney-general <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> ſecretary <hi>Weſt,</hi> judge <hi>Palmer,</hi> the room being alſo full of other people, moſt of them his attendants, he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to tell me, he would have my judgment about this queſtion; <hi>Whether all the lands in</hi> New-England <hi>were not the king's?</hi> I told him I was ſurprized with ſuch a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and was not willing to ſpeak to it; that being a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, if it was a queſtion about a matter of religion, I ſhould not be averſe, but this being a ſtate matter, I did not look upon it as proper for me to declare my mind in it, therefore entreated again and again that I might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed. Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe</hi> replied and urged me with much importunity, ſaying, Becauſe you are a miniſter, therefore we deſire to know your judgment in it, then I told him, if I muſt ſpeak to it, I would only ſpeak as a miniſter from ſcripture and reaſon, not medling with the law. He ſaid, the king's attorney was preſent there to inform what was law. I then ſaid, I did not underſtand that the lands of <hi>New-England</hi> were the king's, but the king's ſubjects, who had for more than ſixty years had the poſſeſſion and uſe of them by a twofold right warranted by the word of God. 1. By a right of juſt occupation from the grand charter in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 1ſt and 9th chapters, whereby God gave the earth to the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> to be ſubdued and repleniſhed. 2. By a right of purchaſe from the Indians, who were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inhabitants, and had poſſeſſion of the land before the Engliſh came hither, and that having lived here ſixty years. I did certainly know that from the beginning of theſe plantations our fathers entered upon the land, partly
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012973_0018_0F903FE507038458"/>
as a wilderneſs and <hi>Vacuum Domicilium,</hi> and partly by the conſent of the Indians, and therefore care was taken to treat with them, and to gain their conſent, giving them ſuch a valuable conſideration as was to their ſatisfaction, and this I told them I had the more certain knowledge of, becauſe having learned the Indian language in my younger time, I was at ſeveral times made uſe of by the government, and by divers particular plantations as an interpreter in treating with the Indians about their lands, which being done and agreed on, the ſeveral town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and proportions of lands of particular men were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſettled by the government of the country, and therefore I did believe that the lands of <hi>New-England</hi> were the ſubjects properties, and not the king's lands. Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe</hi> and the reſt replied, that the lands were the king's, and that he gave the lands within ſuch limits to his ſubjects by a charter upon ſuch conditions as were not performed, and therefore all the lands of <hi>New-England</hi> have returned to the king, and that the attorney general then preſent could tell what was law, who ſpake divers things to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe</hi> had done, ſlighting what I had ſaid, and vilifying the Indian title, ſaying, they were brutes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if we had poſſeſſed and uſed the land, they ſaid we were the king's ſubjects, and what lands the king's ſubjects have, they are the king's, and one of them uſed ſuch an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>where-ever an Engliſhman ſets his foot, all that he hath is the king's,</hi> and more to the ſame purpoſe. I told them that ſo far as I underſtood, we received only the right and power of government from the king's charter within ſuch limits and bounds, but the right of the land and ſoil we had received from God according to his grand charter to the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and with the conſent of the native inhabitants as I had expreſſed before. They ſtill inſiſted on the king's right to the land as before, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I told them, I had heard it was a ſtanding principle in law and reaſon, <hi>nil dat qui non habet;</hi> and from thence I propounded this argument, he that hath no right, can give no right to another, but the king had no right to the lands of <hi>America</hi> before the Engliſh came hither, therefore he could give no right to them. I told them, I knew not of any that could be pleaded but from a Popiſh principle, that chriſtians have a right to the lands of heathen, upon which the Pope as the head of the chriſtians had given the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> to the king of <hi>Spain,</hi> but this was diſowned by all proteſtants. Therefore I left it to them to affirm and prove
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012973_0019_0F903FE5C5AEB640"/>
the king's title. They replied and inſiſted much upon that, that the king had a right by his ſubjects coming and taking poſſeſſion of this land. And at laſt Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe</hi> ſaid with indignation, either you are ſubjects or you are rebels, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating, as I underſtood him, according to the whole ſcope and tendency of his ſpeeches and actions, that if we would not yield all the lands of <hi>New-England</hi> to be the king's, ſo as to take patents for lands, and to pay rent for the ſame, then we ſhould not be accounted ſubjects but rebels, and treated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. There were many other various replies and anſwers on both ſides, but this is the ſum and ſubſtance of that diſcourſe.</p>

The deed being conſidered by Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe,</hi> he ſaid it was worded well, and recorded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>New-England</hi> cuſtom or words to the ſame purpoſe. He further enquired how the title was derived, he the ſaid <hi>Lynde</hi> told him, that he bought it of, had it of, his father-in-law in marriage with his wife, and his ſaid father from <hi>Charleſtown,</hi> and the ſaid town from the general court grant of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> and alſo by purchaſe from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and he ſaid, my title were nothing worth if that were all.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012973_0020_0F903FE697837090"/>
At another time after ſhewing him an Indian deed for land, he ſaid, that their hand was no more worth than a ſcratch of a bear's paw, under-valuing all my titles, though every way le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal under our former charter government. I then petitioned for a patent for my whole eſtate, but Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> deputy ſecretary told me I muſt have ſo many patents as there were counties that I had parcels of land in, if not towns, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thing ſo chargeable and difficult I delayed, upon which I had a writ of intruſion ſerved upon me in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſummer 1688, the copy whereof is in the <hi>Charleſtown</hi> men's complaint, and was at the ſame time with that of Mr. <hi>James Ruſſell</hi>'s, Mr. <hi>Seawall</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Shrimpton</hi>'s, it being for the ſame land in part that I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my title unto Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe</hi> as above, being my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and thoſe I derived it from poſſeſſed, incloſed, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for about fifty years, at which time I gave Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> attorney general three pounds in money, promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if he would let the action fall I would pay court charges, and give him ten pound, when I had a patent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated for that ſmall parcel of land, that ſaid writ was ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon me for, which I did becauſe a Quaker that had the promiſe of it from the governor, as I was informed in the governor's preſence ſhould not have it from me, the ſaid <hi>Lynde,</hi> having about ſeven acres more in the ſame common field or paſture, about a mile from his forty-nine acres near unto the land that the ſaid governor gave unto Mr. <hi>Charles Lidget,</hi> of divers of my neighbours which I concluded muſt go the ſame way theirs went and therefore though deſired to be patenteed by the ſaid <hi>Lynde</hi> with the forty-nine acres, he could not obtain a grant for it. About the ſame time Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> attorney general aſked the ſaid <hi>Lynde</hi> what he would do about the reſt of his land, telling him the ſaid <hi>Lynde</hi> that he would meet with the like trouble about all the reſt of his lands that he poſſeſſed, and were it not for the governor's going to <hi>New-York</hi> at this time, there would be a writ of intruſion againſt every man in the colony of any conſiderable eſtate, or as many as a cart could hold, and for the poorer ſort of people ſaid Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe</hi> would take other meaſures, or words to the ſame purpoſe. The ſaid <hi>Lynde</hi> further ſaith, That after judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments obtained for ſmall wrongs done him, triable by their own laws before a juſtice of the peace, from whom they allowed no appeals in ſmall cauſes, he was forced out of his own county by writs of falſe judgment; and although at the firſt ſuperiour court in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> the thing was ſo far oppoſed by judge <hi>Stoughton</hi> as illegal, as that it was put by,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012973_0021_0F903FE743D68F28"/>
yet the next term by judge <hi>Dudley</hi> and judge <hi>Palmer,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Lynde</hi> was forced to anſwer <hi>George Farewell</hi> attorney aforeſaid, then ſaying in open court in <hi>Charleſtown,</hi> that all cauſes muſt be brought to <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> becauſe there was not honeſt men enough in <hi>Middleſex</hi> to make a jury to ſerve their turns, or words to that purpoſe; nor did <hi>Suffolk,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by their practice, for they made uſe of non-reſidents in divers caſes there.

At the ſame time ſome of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil

deſired Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> that this <hi>Hope Hood</hi> might be ſent for before the council, to which he replied, that he never had had a quarter of an hour's conference with any of them, and that he ſcorned to diſcourſe with any heathen of them all, yet all this notwithſtanding, at the ſame time whilſt the council was thus met, did Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> privately withdraw himſelf, and repair to the priſon where this <hi>Hope Hood</hi> was priſoner, and did there continue with him two or three hours in private, the truth of what is above related is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by ſundry gentlemen that were of <hi>Edmund's</hi> council, and were then ear witneſſes, and likewiſe by others that ſaw Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> at the priſon; <hi>and as it is now verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that at that very time he conſulted the miſchief that is now acted by the ſaid</hi> Hope Hood and company.</q> Thus Mr. <hi>Danforth.</hi>

                  <p>That Sir <hi>Edmund's high ſheriff was a ſtranger in the country, and one that had no eſtate there</hi> needs no proof, and that <hi>ſtrangers who had no freehold, were impannelled for Jurors</hi> is notoriouſly known. So it was in the caſe of the <hi>Ipſwich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> as hath been noted, and when that reverend perſon Mr. <hi>Charles Morton,</hi> was cauſeleſly and maliciouſly proſecuted, he was not only compelled to anſwer (contrary to law) in another county, and not in that wherein the good ſermon they found fault with, was preached, but that if poſſible, they might give him a blow, there was ſummoned to ſerve as a jury man, one <hi>John Gibſon</hi> no houſholder nor of any eſtate or credit, and one <hi>John Levingſworth</hi> a brick-layer, who lived in another colony two hundred miles diſtance.

                  <p n="11">11. That the perſons objected againſt, were ſome of them <hi>guilty of great extortion</hi> is manifeſt from what has been rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and may yet be further proved, for (as by ſome inſtances we have already ſeen, and ſhall now hear more) they <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled men to take patents for their own lands,</hi> which they and their fathers before them, had quietly poſſeſſed till theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous creatures became a <hi>nuſance</hi> to the country, and it may be, none more criminal, as to this particular, than Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> and Mr. <hi>Weſt.</hi> A friend of their own, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Randolph,</hi> does in ſeveral of his Letters bitterly complain of them upon this account.

                  <p>
                     <q>I believe all the inhabitants in <hi>Boſton</hi> will be forced to take grants and conformations of their lands, as now intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the inhabitants of the province of <hi>Maine</hi> which will bring in <hi>vaſt profits to Mr. Weſt,</hi> he taking what fees he pleaſes to demand.

the ſame, <hi>June,</hi> 21, 1688, he hath theſe words. <q>I went to one <hi>Shurte</hi> town-clerk of <hi>Pemyquid,</hi> to know what leaſes were made lately, and by whom, and for what quit rent, he told me that above a year ago Captain <hi>Palmer,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> produced to them a commiſſion from Colonel <hi>Dungan,</hi> to diſpoſe of all their lands to whoever would take leaſes at five ſhillings the hundred acres quit rent. They let there and at a place called <hi>Dartmouth</hi> twelve or ſixteen miles diſtant from <hi>Pemyquid</hi> about one hundred and forty leaſes, ſome had eight hundred or ten hundred acres, few leſs than a hundred, ſome but three or four acres and all paid 2<abbr>l.</abbr> 10<abbr>s.</abbr> for paſſing their grants of 100 acres of wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, with twenty acres of marſh where-ever it could be found, but this bred a great miſchief among the people; few or none have their lands meaſured or marked, they were in haſte, and got what they could, <hi>they had their emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries among the poor people, and frighted them to take grants,</hi> ſome come and complained to the governor, and prayed him to <hi>confirm their rights which he refuſed to do,</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and whole proceeding being illegal, having notice they were to be under his government, they reſented it, but ſerved their turn. <hi>The poor have been very much oppreſſed here,</hi> the fort run all to ruin, and wants a great deal to repair it. Captain <hi>Palmer</hi> and Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> laid out for themſelves ſuch large lots, and Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> though not there, had a child's portion, I think ſome have eight thouſand or ten thouſand acres. <hi>I hear not of one penny rent comming in to the king, from them who have their grants confirmed at York.</hi> and the five ſhillings an hundred acres was only <hi>a ſham</hi> upon the people: at our return we ſaw very good land at <hi>Winter Harbour,</hi> enough to make large ſettlements for many people. The governor will have it firſt meaſured, and then ſurveyed, and then will diſpoſe of it for ſettlements, Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> and his family are ſettled at <hi>Boſton,</hi> he is made <hi>Attorney general, and now the governer is ſafe in his</hi> New-York <hi>Confidents,</hi> all others being ſtrangers, to his <hi>council.</hi> 'Twas not well done of <hi>Palmer</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> to tear all in peices that was ſettled and granted at <hi>Pemyquid</hi> by Sir <hi>Edmund,</hi> that was the ſeene where they <hi>placed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed at pleaſure and were as arbitary as the great Turk. Some of the firſt ſettlers of that eaſtern country were denied grants of their own lands, whilſt thoſe men have given the improved lands amongſt themſelves,</hi> of which I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> hath complained.</q> In another, <hi>May</hi> the 10th 1689, he ſays; <q>I muſt confeſs there have been <hi>ill men from

New-York,</hi> who have too much ſtudied the diſeaſe of this people, and both in courts and councils, they have not been <hi>treated well.</hi>
                     </q> Thus does <hi>Edward Randolph,</hi> a bird of the ſame feather with themſelves confeſs the truth, as to this matter, concerning <hi>his brother</hi> Palmer <hi>and</hi> Weſt.</p>
                  <p>And that <hi>oppreſſive fees have been extorted by indigent and exacting officers</hi> is declared by Mr. <hi>Hinckley</hi> the preſent gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>New-Plymouth</hi> in his <hi>narrative of the grievances and oppreſſions of their majeſties good ſubjects in the colony of</hi> New-Plymouth <hi>in</hi> New-England, <hi>by the illegal and arbitrary act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the late Government under Sir</hi> Edmund Androſſe, which <hi>narrative</hi> is too large to be here inſerted, but it is poſſible it may be publiſhed by itſelf, whereby it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that every corner in the country did ring with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the oppreſſions, and (to ſpeak in Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi>'s phraſe) <hi>horrible uſages</hi> of theſe ill men. Some paſſages out of Mr. <hi>Hinckley's narrative</hi> reſpecting this matter, we ſhall here tranſcribe, whoſe words are theſe which follow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The bill of coſt taxed by judge <hi>Palmer</hi> ſeems alſo to be the greateſt extortion ever heard of before, as thrice twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhillings for three motions for judgment at the ſame term, (and was it not their courteſy they did not move ten times one after another at the ſame rate) and taxed alſo, <hi>five pound for the king's attorney, and one and twenty ſhillings for the judges, and ten ſhillings for the ſheriff,</hi> and other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars as by the ſaid bill appeareth, and that which makes it the greater extortion is, that the whole bill of coſt was exacted of every one of them, which each of them muſt pay down, or be kept priſoners till they did, though all ſeven of them were jointly informed againſt in one infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</q> Thus Mr. <hi>Hinckley.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The cry of poor widows and fatherleſs is gone up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt them on this account; for the probate of a will and letter of adminiſtration above fifty ſhillings hath been extorted out of the hands of the poor, nay they have been ſometimes forced to pay more than four pounds, when not much above a crown had been due. Let <hi>Andrew Sergeant</hi> and <hi>Joſeph Quilter</hi> among many others ſpeak if this be not true, who were compelled to travel two hundred miles for the probate of a will, and to pay the unreaſonable and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive fees complained of.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe things, under Sir <hi>Edmund</hi>'s government they had wicked ways to extort money when they pleaſed. Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Coleman</hi> complains (and hath given his oath according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that upon the ſuppoſed hired evidence of one man he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012973_0038_0F903FF896A0A210"/>
forty pounds damage in his eſtate. And there were complaints all over the country that Sir <hi>Edmund's exciſe men</hi> would pretend ſickneſs on the road, and get a cup of drink of the hoſpitable people, but privately drop a piece of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and afterwards make oath that they bought drink at thoſe houſes, for which the innocent perſons were fined moſt unreaſonably, and which was extorted from them, though theſe villanies were declared and made known to thoſe then in power. <hi>William Goodhue,</hi> and <hi>Mary Dennis</hi> might be produced as witneſs hereof, with many more. Some of Sir <hi>Edmund</hi>'s creatures have ſaid, that ſuch things as theſe made <hi>his government to ſtink.</hi> Alſo <hi>John Hovey</hi> and others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of ſuſtaining ten pounds damages by the extortion of officers, though never any thing (they could hear of) was charged upon them to this day, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Chriſtoper Oſgood</hi> complain of their being ſent to priſon nine or ten days, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a mittimus, or any thing laid to their charge,</hi> and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they were forced to pay exceſſive charges—It would fill a volume, if we ſhould produce and inſert all the <hi>affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits</hi> which do confirm the truth of theſe complaints.</p>
                  <p>In the time of that unhappy government, if the officers wanted money, it was but ſeizing and impriſoning the beſt men in the country for no fault in the world, and the greedy officers would hereby have griſt to their mill. Thus was Major <hi>Appleton</hi> dealt with. Thus Captain <hi>Bradſtreet.</hi> Thus that worthy and worſhipful gentleman <hi>Nathaniel Salſtoriſtal,</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, was ſerved by them and <hi>barbarouſly proſecuted,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any information or crime laid to his charge; for he had done nothing worthy of bonds, but it was the pleaſure of Sir <hi>Edmund</hi> and ſome others, thus to abuſe a gentleman far more honourably deſcended than himſelf, and one concerned in the government of <hi>New-England</hi> before him, but (to his eternal renown) one who refuſed to <hi>accept of an illegal and arbitrary commiſſion,</hi> when in the reign of the late king <hi>James</hi> it was offered to him.</p>
                  <p>We have now ſeen a whole jury of complaints which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in their verdict againſt Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe</hi> and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates. Were theſe things to be heard upon the place, where the witneſſes who gave in their <hi>affidavits</hi> are reſident, they would amount to legal proof, as to every particular which was by <hi>the agents of the Maſſachuſetts colony in</hi> New-England objected againſt Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe,</hi> and others ſeized and ſecured by the people there.</p>
                  <p>Moreover there are other matters referring to Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe</hi> which cauſed great, and almoſt univerſal jealouſy of
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012973_0039_0F903FF98EC82630"/>
him. For firſt, His commiſſion was ſuch as would make any one believe that a courtier in the time of the late king <hi>James</hi> ſpoke true, who ſaid Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe was ſent to</hi> New-England <hi>on purpoſe to be a plague to the people there.</hi> For he with three or four more, none of them choſen by the people, but rather by that <hi>implacable enemy who proſceuted the</hi> quo warranto's <hi>againſt their charters,</hi> had power given them to make laws, and raiſe what monies they ſhould think meet for the ſupport of their own government, and he had power himſelf alone to ſend the beſt and moſt uſeful men a thouſand miles, (and further if he would) out of the country, and to build cities and caſtles (in the air if he could) and demoliſh them again, and make the purſes of the poor people pay for it all. Such a commiſſion was an unſufferable grievance, and no honeſt Engliſhman would ever have accepted of it, or acted by it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Jealouſies were augumented by his involving the country in a war with the Indians, by means whereof he hath occaſioned the ruin of many families and plantations; yea the death or captivity of we know not how many ſouls. <hi>For he went (with the</hi> Roſe <hi>frigate, and violently ſeized, and took and carried away, in a time of peace all the houſhold goods and merchandiſes of</hi> monſieur Cakeen <hi>a Frenchman at</hi> Penobſcot <hi>who was allied to the Indians</hi> having married the daughter of one of their <hi>princes</hi> whom they call <hi>Sagamores</hi> or <hi>Sachems;</hi> and when this was done, it was eaſy to foreſee, and was generally concluded that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> would ſoon be upon the Engliſh, as it quickly came to paſs. After the flame was kindled, and barbarous outrages commited by the Indians, Sir <hi>Edmund</hi>'s managery was ſuch as filled the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with greater fears of an <hi>horrid deſign.</hi> For bloody Indians whom the Engliſh had ſecured, were not only diſmiſſed, but rather courted than puniſhed by him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It cannot be expreſt what juſt and amazing fears ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the people of <hi>New-England</hi> when they had notice of the late <hi>king James</hi> being in <hi>France,</hi> leſt Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe</hi> whoſe governor and confident he was, ſhould betray them into the power of the <hi>French king,</hi> other circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to ſtrenghen theſe fears. The <hi>Mohawks</hi> and other Indians were in hoſtility againſt the <hi>French</hi> and it was very advantagious to the Engliſh intereſt to have it ſo, but Sir <hi>Edmund cauſed them to make a peace with the French,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the French intereſt in thoſe parts was ſtrengthened, and the Engliſh weakened. Mr. <hi>Peter Reverdy</hi> (a French pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant) in his <hi>memoirs</hi> concerning Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="unknown:012973_0040_0F903FFC401D2CC0"/>After that Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe and his accomplices</hi> were ſecured, ſuch reports and informations came to hand, as made <hi>New-England</hi> admire the divine providence in accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was done againſt the late oppreſſors. They then ſaw the perſons from whom they ſuſpected the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, were now incapable of betraying them.</p>
                  <p>If an unaccountable inſtinct and reſolution had not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imated the inhabitants in and about <hi>Boſton,</hi> to ſeize on thoſe few men, the people there believe <hi>New-England</hi> would have been in the hands not of <hi>king William</hi> but <hi>king Lewis e'er this day:</hi> For in <hi>Sept.</hi> 1689, ſeveral veſſels belonging to <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were taken near <hi>Canſoe</hi> in <hi>America</hi> by ſome French men of war. The priſoners ſince at liberty, inform, that the French told them, that there was a fleet of ſhips bound from <hi>France</hi> directly for <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> but ſome of them were taken by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhips of war, and three or four of them loſt at <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> and that Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe</hi> had ſent to the French king for them to come over, and the country ſhould be delivered up. And the Lieutenant of a French man of war profeſſed, that if Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe</hi> had not been impriſoned, they would then have gone to <hi>Boſton.</hi> This ſhews what a good opinion the French had of him, and ſuch reports ſo teſtified made a ſtrange impreſſion on the ſpirits of the people throughout the country: And that the world may ſee we do not write fictions of our own, the ſubſequent <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidavits</hi> are produced and here inſerted.</p>

                     <pb n="44" facs="unknown:012973_0043_0F903FFF437F8DB8"/>But as to one of the crimes objected againſt Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe</hi> and his accomplices, <hi>Habemus confitentem reum.</hi> Mr. <hi>Palmer cannot deny but that they levied monies on the king's ſubjects in</hi> New-England, <hi>contrary to the fundamentals of the Engliſh government,</hi> which doth not allow the impoſition of taxes without a <hi>parliament.</hi> The <hi>New-Englanders</hi> ſuppoſed that their late oppreſſors had been guilty of no leſs than a capital crime by their raiſing money in ſuch a way as they did; and we are aſſured that one of them after he received, and before he acted by virtue of his illegal commiſſion from the late king, profeſſed, that <hi>if ever he had an hand in raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a penny of money without an aſſembly, his neck ſhould go for it;</hi> and yet no man that we know of had a deeper hand in it than this perſon had. But Mr. <hi>Palmer,</hi> for the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this ſo foul a buſineſs, lays down ſeveral poſitions which he would have no man deny; one of his poſitions is. <hi>That it is a fundamental point conſented to by all chriſtian na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, That the firſt diſcoverer of a country inhabited by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, gives a right and dominion of that country to the prince in whoſe ſervice and employment the diſcoverers were ſent.</hi> Theſe are his words, p. 17. We affirm, that this <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal point</hi> (as he calls it) is not a <hi>chriſtian,</hi> but <hi>an unchriſtian principle.</hi> It is controverted among the School-men, <hi>an domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium fundatur in gratiâ. Papiſts are</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> is) for the <hi>affirmative,</hi> but the <hi>ſcripture teaches us to believe</hi> that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then nations, <hi>and the ſons of Adam,</hi> and not <hi>the children of Iſrael</hi> only, have a right to the earth, and to the inheritance which God hath given them therein, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.8. When Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> hath proved that <hi>infidels</hi> are not the <hi>ſons of Adam,</hi> we ſhall conſent to his notion, that chriſtians may invade their rights, and take their lands from them, and give them to whom they pleaſe, and that the <hi>pope</hi> may give all <hi>America</hi> to the <hi>king of Spain.</hi> But let him know, that the firſt plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in <hi>New-England,</hi> had more of conſcience and the fear of God in them, than it ſeems Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> hath. For they were not willing to <hi>wrong the Indians in their properties;</hi> for which cauſe it was that they purchaſed from the natives their right to the ſoil in that part of the world, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what right they had by virtue of their charters from the kings of <hi>England.</hi> Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi>'s poſition is clearly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Jus Gentium &amp; Jus Naturale,</hi> which inſtructs every man, <hi>Nemini injuriam facers.</hi> He that ſhall violently, and without any juſt cauſe take from infidels their lands, where they plant, and by which they ſubſiſt does them manifeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. And let us know of Mr. <hi>Palmer,</hi> if <hi>chriſtian</hi> princes
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012973_0044_0F90400023C4EFC8"/>
have power to diſpoſe of the lands belonging to <hi>infidels</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> whether they have the like dominion over the lands belonging to the <hi>infidels in the Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and if theſe <hi>infidels</hi> ſhall refuſe to conſent that ſuch <hi>chriſtians</hi> ſhall poſſeſs their lands, that then they may lawfully <hi>vi &amp; armis</hi> expel or deſtroy them, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did! We may ſend Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> for further inſtruction in this point to <hi>Balaam's aſs,</hi> which ingenuouſly acknowledged that her maſter (though an infidel) had a property in, and right of dominion over her, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.30. But this <hi>gentleman</hi> hath ſome other <hi>aſſertions</hi> which he would have us take for <hi>poſtulata,</hi> and then we ſhall be his <hi>ſlaves</hi> without all peradventures. He tells us in page 17, 18, 19, that the <hi>Engliſh plantations (in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulur</hi> New-England) <hi>are no parts of the empire of</hi> England, <hi>but like</hi> Wales <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>which were conquered, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the dominion of the crown of</hi> England, <hi>and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that wears the crown, may ſet up governments over them, which are deſpotick and abſolute, without any regard to</hi> Magna Charta, <hi>and that whereas in</hi> Barbadoes, Jamaica, Virginia, <hi>&amp;c. they have their aſſemblies, that is only from the favor of the prince, and not that they could pretend right to ſuch privileges of Engliſhmen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now we need no further <hi>diſcovery of the man.</hi> Could the people of <hi>New-England</hi> who are zealous for Engliſh li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties ever endure it long, that ſuch a perſon as this ſhould be made one of their <hi>judges,</hi> that by ſqueezing of them, he might be able to pay his <hi>debts?</hi> And can any rational man believe, that perſons of ſuch principles did not <hi>tyrannize</hi> over that people when once they had them in their cruel clutches, and could pretend the authority of the late king <hi>James</hi> for for what they did? in our opinion Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> hath not done like a wiſe man thus to expoſe himſelf to the juſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and indignation of all the <hi>Engliſh plantations.</hi> If ever it ſhould be his chance to be amongſt them again, what could he expect but to be looked on as <hi>communis hoſtis,</hi> when he thus openly declares that they have no Engliſh liberties belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them? — That worthy gentleman Sir <hi>William Jones</hi> (who was <hi>Attorney General</hi> in the reign of king <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond) had certainly more underſtanding in the law than Captain <hi>Palmer,</hi> and yet Captain <hi>Palmer</hi> (we ſuppoſe) is not ignorant that when ſome propoſed, that <hi>Jamaica</hi> (and ſo the other plantations) might be governed without any aſſembly, <hi>that excellency Attorney</hi> (not like Captain <hi>Palmer</hi> but like an Engliſhman) told the then king, <hi>that he could no more grant a commiſſion to levy money <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

When Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> hath proved that he hath ſaid ſomething. They have (through the mercy of God) obtained conqueſts over many of their enemies, both <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> to the enlargement of the Engliſh dominions. But except Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> and the reſt of that crew will ſay, that his and their <hi>domineering</hi> a while was a <hi>conqueſt,</hi> they were never yet a <hi>conquered people.</hi> So that his alledging the caſe of <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> before Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh liberties were granted to them, is an impertinent ſtory. Beſides, he forgets that there was <hi>an original contract</hi> between the king and the firſt planters in <hi>New-England,</hi> the king promiſing them, if they at their own coſt and charge would ſubdue a wilderneſs, and enlarge his dominions, they and their poſterity after them ſhould enjoy ſuch privileges as are in their charters expreſſed, of which that of not having taxes impoſed on them without their own conſent was one. Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> and his <hi>brethren oppreſſors</hi> will readily reply, their <hi>charter</hi> was condemned. But he cannot think, that the judgment againſt their charter made them ceaſe to be <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen.</hi> And only the colony of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> had their charter condemned. And yet theſe men ventured to levy monies on the king's ſubjects in <hi>Connecticut colony.</hi> For the which <hi>invaſion of liberty and property</hi> they can never anſwer. Indeed they ſay the corporation of <hi>Connecticut ſurrendered their charter.</hi> But who told them ſo? It is certain, that no one belonging to the government there, knoweth of any ſuch thing; and how their oppreſſors ſhould know that <hi>Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticut</hi> made a ſurrender of their charter when the perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned know nothing of it, is very ſtrange. We can produce that written by the ſecretary of that colony with his own hand, and alſo ſigned by the preſent governor there, which declares the contary to what theſe men (as untruly as boldly) affirm.

                              <p>In the ſecond year of the reign of king <hi>James</hi> the ſecond we had a <hi>quo warranto</hi> ſerved upon us by <hi>Edward Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph,</hi> requiring our appearance before his majeſty's courts in <hi>England,</hi> and although the time of our appearance was elapſed before the ſerving of the ſaid <hi>quo warranto,</hi> yet we humbly petitioned his majeſty for his favour, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of our charter with the privileges thereof. But we received no other favour but a ſecond <hi>quo warranto,</hi> and we well obſerving that the <hi>charter of London</hi> and other conſiderable cities in <hi>England</hi> were condemned, and that <hi>the charter of the Maſſachuſetts</hi> had undergone the like fate, plainly ſaw what we might expect, <hi>yet we not judging it good or lawful to be active in ſurrendering what</hi> had coſt us ſo dear, nor to be altogether ſilent, we impowered an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney to appear on our behalf, and to preſent our humble addreſs to his majeſty, but quickly upon it as Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe informed us,</hi> he was impowered by his majeſty to receive <hi>the ſurrender of our charter,</hi> if we ſaw meet ſo to do and us alſo to take under his government. Alſo, <hi>Col.

                  <p>Thus did Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe</hi> and his creatures, who were deeply concerned in the illegal actions of the late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy reigns, contrary to the laws of God and men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a rape on a whole colony; for which violence it is hoped they may account, and make reparation (if poſſible) to thoſe many whoſe properties as well as liberties have been inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by them.</p>
                  <p>Captain <hi>Palmer</hi> in the cloſe of his <hi>partial account of New-England</hi> entertains his readers with an <hi>harangue</hi> about the <hi>ſin of rebellion,</hi> and miſapplies ſeveral ſcriptures that ſo he might make the world believe that the people of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have been guilty of wicked <hi>rebellion</hi> by their caſting off the arbitrary power of thoſe ill men who invaded liberty and property to ſuch an intolerable degree as hath been proved againſt them. But does he in ſober ſadneſs think, that if when wolves are got among ſheep in a wilderneſs, the ſhepherds and principal men there ſhall keep them from ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, that this is the ſin of rebellion condemned in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? How or by whoſe authority our <hi>lawyer</hi> comes to play the <hi>divine</hi> we know not. But ſince he hath thought meet to take a ſpiritual weapon into his hand, let him know that the ſcripture ſpeaks of a lawful and good <hi>rebellion,</hi> as well as of that which is unlawful. It is ſaid of good <hi>Hezekiah that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt the king of Aſſyria and ſerved him not,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.7.

And is this the <hi>ſincerity and chriſtian moderation</hi> which he boaſts himſelf of in his preface? Surely theſe are the <hi>hiſſings of the old ſerpent,</hi> and do ſufficiently indicate whoſe children the men are that uſe them. Since he will be at divinity, let him (if he can) read the <hi>apologies</hi> written by <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and there ſee if <hi>Pagans</hi> did not accuſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of old, juſt after the ſame manner, and with the ſame crimes that he wickedly upbraids that good and loyal people with. Who are they that uſe to call the holieſt and moſt conſcientious men in the world <hi>hypocrites, liars, rebels, and what not?</hi> but they that are themſelves the greateſt <hi>hypocrites, liars,</hi> and <hi>rebels</hi> againſt heaven that the earth does bear? It is hard to believe that Captain <hi>Palmer</hi> does not rebel againſt the light of his own conſcience, when he affirms as in page 38, that in <hi>New-England, every thing that hath any relation to their majeſties is neglected and unregarded, without any recognition of their authority over thoſe dominions.</hi> He cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the humble <hi>addreſſes</hi> which the people in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have from time to time made to their preſent majeſties, acknowledging their authority. He knows that on the firſt notice of their majeſties being proclaimed <hi>king</hi> and <hi>queen</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> both thoſe now in government in <hi>New-England,</hi> and the body of the people with them, did (without any command) of their own accord, with the greateſt joy proclaim their majeſties in <hi>New-England.</hi> He knows that their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties have no ſubjects more cordialy and zealouſly devoted to them than thoſe in <hi>New-England</hi> are, or that do with greater fervor pray for their long and happy reigns, or that are more willing to expoſe themſelves to the utmoſt hazards in their ſervice, and yet this man that knoweth all this, to caſt an <hi>odium</hi> on that loyal and good people, inſinuates as if they were <hi>rebels,</hi> and <hi>diſaffected</hi> to the preſent government, and deſigned to ſet up an <hi>independent common wealth,</hi> and had <hi>no regard to the laws of God or men.</hi> After this lying and malicious rate hath he expreſſed himſelf.

                  <p>THE particulars mentioned in the enſuing <hi>narrative,</hi> are but a ſmall part of the grievances juſtly complained of by the people in <hi>New-England,</hi> during their three years oppreſſion under Sir <hi>Edmund Androſſe.</hi> For a more full account, the reader is referred to the juſtification of the revolution in <hi>New-England,</hi> where every particular exhibited againſt Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> and his accomplices, by the agents lately ſent to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is by the <hi>affidavits</hi> of honeſt men confirmed. If ſome men find themſelves thereby expoſed to the juſt reſentments and indignation of all true chriſtians, or true Engliſhmen, they muſt thank themſelves for publiſhing ſuch untrue accounts as that which goes under the name of Captain <hi>John Palmer</hi>'s, and that ſcandalous pamphlet called <hi>New-England's Faction diſcovered,</hi> ſuppoſed to be written by an implacable enemy of all good men, and a perſon that for impudence and lying has few equals in the world. This which follows, being ſigned by ſeveral gentlemen of great integrity, who likewiſe had a particular knowledge of the things by them related, is therefore of unqueſtionable credit. The deſign in making of it thus public, is to vindicate their majeſties loyal ſubjects in <hi>New-England,</hi> and to give a true repreſentation of things unto thoſe who have by falſe relations been impoſed on.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="unknown:012973_0051_0F90400541BF0580"/>
                     <hi>Government,</hi> we would give ſome information of the <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and male-adminiſtrations</hi> under the ſame. Upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration had thereof, and in anſwer thereunto, we cannot but own and declare, that <hi>not only ourſelves and many others in the ſame ſtation</hi> (not now preſent to join with us) were of a long time much <hi>diſſatiſfied and diſcouraged with very many of the proceedings and adminiſtrations in the ſaid government;</hi> and had little reaſon to wonder that ſo great a number of the people were ſo too. It might well have been expected that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor (not ſo ſucceſsful heretofore) notwithſtanding the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarineſs (to ſay no more) of many clauſes and powers in his commiſſion; yea the rather and the more, becauſe thereof would have cautioned and moderated the execution of the ſame: But to our great trouble we found it very much otherwiſe. Many were the things that were account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed irregular and grievous therein, far from conducing to the public weal of the territory, and not a little to the diſſervice of the crown, as tending rather to the diſturbing and diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the ſubjects here, than to the furtherance of that chearful obedience, loyalty, love and duty in them, which ought by all good means, to have been nouriſhed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted. And of all this unhappineſs, we muſt reckon the firſt ſtep and in-let to be that <hi>the governor did</hi> ſo quickly neglect the great number of the council, and <hi>chiefly adhere unto and govern by the advice</hi> only of a few others, the principal <hi>of them ſtrangers to the country, without eſtates or intereſt therein to oblige them, perſons of known and declared prejudices againſt us, and that had plainly laid their chiefeſt deſigns and hopes to make unreaſonable profit of this poor people.</hi> Innumerable were the evil effects that from hence were continually growing up amongſt us; <hi>the debates in council were not ſo free as ought to have been,</hi> but too much over-ruled, and a great deal of harſhneſs continually expreſſed againſt perſons and opinions that did not pleaſe. <hi>The greateſt rigour and ſeverity was too often uſed towards the ſobereſt ſort of people,</hi> when any thing could be found or pretended againſt them, their humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions were little regarded, and <hi>inexorable perſecutions order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt them,</hi> whilſt in the mean time <hi>the notorious viciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and profaneneſs of others met not with</hi> the like <hi>diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> but perſons of ſuch a character were put into places of buſineſs and truſt. The long ſettled maintenance of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick miniſtry, even from thoſe that applied themſelves to no other way of worſhip, but continued ordinary hearers, could not be upheld by any act of authority providing for the ſame, and ſchools of learning ſo well taken care of formerly, were
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:012973_0052_0F904007F3F12A38"/>
in moſt places fallen to decay, and many more ſuch like might be reckoned up. But we ſhall more eſpecially inſtance fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the particulars following, as not the leaſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was as we thought a great ſlight put upon the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and to the prejudice of the good people of the territory, that whereas at the governor's firſt coming a committee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thereunto by himſelf, and a full council had with great care and ſeveral weeks trouble reviſed a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of orders and laws collected out of the ſeveral law-books of theſe colonies found by long experience very needful and agreeable to the good of theſe plantations, which laws ſo collected and reviſed, were again preſented unto, and upon further adviſement approved by the governor and council and paſſed. Yet upon the introducing Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> from <hi>New-York</hi> to be deputy ſecretary, they were, for what cauſes we know not, totally laid aſide, and the people denied the benefit of them. And this grievance was ſo much the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and a plainer indication of the ſeverity of ſome men in their intended management of things, becauſe on good deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration they had alſo paſſed an order of council, that until the council ſhould take further order, the ſeveral juſtices, town-officers, and others ſhould proceed according to former uſages, and ſuch local laws in the ſeveral parts of this domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as are not repugnant to the laws of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> Yet becauſe by virtue of the ſaid order ſome in authority have proceeded to put forth their power for the ſupport of the miniſtry, and ſome others did juſtify themſelves in ſome actions done by them that were not pleaſing; hereupon when a diſcourſe only, and ſome debate thereof had paſſed in council, but <hi>without any regular determination made,</hi> and contrary to the expreſs word of the ſaid order, <hi>it was entered in the council-book</hi> concerning it, reſolved that the ſame was only in force till the next ſeſſion of the council, and ſo deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined as null of itſelf, and that none preſume to act purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to ſuch laws as are or ſhall be made here.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Whereas</hi> the act for the continuing and eſtabliſhing of ſeveral rates, duties and impoſts, was one of the firſt of ſo great moment that came out in a form under the ſeal of the territory, and was publickly proclaimed, we that were preſent have great cauſe to remember what trouble and diſſatisfaction there was among the members of the council concerning the ſame. As that act was framed and urged upon us, <hi>a very conſiderable number (and we believe we were
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:012973_0053_0F9040095125E480"/>
the major part) diſſented</hi> from and argued much againſt it. And though the governor expreſſed not a little heat and poſitiveneſs alledging his inſtructions, and held the council together, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably a very long time about it. Yet when we did at laſt break up we could not imagine that he could take the bill to be agreed to; <hi>nevertheleſs it was the next day (to our wonderment) brought in fairly engroſſed in parchment, and quickly ſigned by the governor without any counting of voices</hi> either then or the day before, which was the more needful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome did continue ſtill to make their objections, others that had ſpoken againſt the bill the day before, declaring their adherence to what they had then ſaid; and many more under ſo great diſcouragement and diſcountenance, as was manifeſted ſitting ſilent, which we are ſure in the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar paſſing of laws can never be reckoned for a conſent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The way</hi> and manner uſed afterwards of propoſing and paſſing all laws was very uncertain and unequal, not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the nature of ſo great a power, nor to the largeneſs of the territory that was to be obliged by them, or to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the councellors appointed therein; for after a little while there were no ſet times appointed or given notice of for the making of laws, that ſo the members of the council might attend in a fuller number to be helpful therein. Bills of the greateſt concernment were uſually firſt conſulted and framed in private, and ſo unexpectedly brought into council at any time, and then our work too was often under great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, not to adviſe freely and conſult about the making of a law thought neceſſary, but to maintain a conteſt in oppoſition to a very inconvenient one, too far promoted and engaged in already; and above all, <hi>there was never any fair way of taking and counting the number of the councellors conſenting and diſſenting,</hi> that ſo the majority might be known in any matter that admitted of any conſiderable reaſonings and debates, by reaſon whereof both laws and other orders and reſolutions might be ſet down as paſſed by the council, which ought not to have been. And when it hath been (as often it was) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly and earneſtly prayed when matters of greater moment than ordinary were in hand, that the debate and reſolution of them might be put off till a fuller council of members from other ſeveral parts of the dominion might be convened ſuch motions were ever diſaccepted, and entertained with no little diſplacency; <hi>ſo that it might be too truly affirmed, that in effect four or five perſons, and thoſe not ſo favourably inclined and diſpoſed as were to be wiſhed for, bear the rule over, and
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:012973_0054_0F90400A70D5ADB0"/>
gave law to a territory the largeſt and moſt conſiderable of any belonging to the dominion of the crown.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>In purſuance</hi> of this way and manner of paſſing laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove expreſſed, there were two in ſpecial that came forth, which we are ſure in fuller and freer councils would have had a full ſtop put to them; <hi>viz. Firſt,</hi> The act for regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the choice of ſelect-men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein the liberty of towns to meet for the managing of their publick affairs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to their common lands, and all other their concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which they had enjoyed for ſo many years, to their great benefit, was moſt unreaſonably reſtrained to once a year, and all other convening of inhabitants as a town meeting, upon any pretence or colour whatſoever, was ſtrictly forbidden: And the other act was that intituled, an act requiring all maſters of ſhips or veſſels to give ſecurity, in which there were ſuch reſtraints laid upon all perſons from tranſporting themſelves freely (as their occaſion might call) out of their territory, that it would have been a meer priſon to all that ſhould be found therein, and ſuch bond required of all ſhips and veſſels (extending in the practice even to ſhallops and wood-boats) as would quickly have intolerably diſcouraged, if not ruined the trade thereof; and all without any other ordinary gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral benefit of the ſaid act, but the filling ſome men's poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets with fees: And (as it might be thought from the time of moving this act, which was when Captain <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> was already gone, and Mr. <hi>Mather was known to be intending for</hi> England) <hi>the obſtructing of ſuch men's going home as were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there to make juſt complaints, and ſeek redreſs of publick grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances;</hi> and when this act had been ſtrenuouſly oppoſed in council here at <hi>Boſton,</hi> where it was more than once vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently urged, and as often denied, <hi>it was carried as far as</hi> New York, <hi>and there an opportunity found for the obtaining of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>The</hi> great matter of properties and titles to our lands is the next to be inſiſted on, his majeſty that granted the charter did fully inveſt the patentees with right to the ſoil through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole limits thereof, and here on the place, the right of the natives was honeſtly purchaſed from them. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, diſtribution, and granting of lands by the patentees, who were alſo incorporated, and made a body politick, was in ſuch a plain, ready, eaſy way, without any charge to the planters, as in the ſettlement of ſo large a country was thought to be moſt agreeable: And ſo much of a publick
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:012973_0055_0F90400A9719C5C8"/>
ſpirit and deſign were thoſe noble gentlemen, that (though well they might) they ſettled not one ſingle penny of ſervice or acknowledgment to themſelves and heirs of any of their grants, a thing ſo ſelf-denying and worthy, that few inſtances can be given of the like. All which notwithſtanding, and the poſſeſſions, deſcents and valuable purchaſes of ſo many years that have paſſed ſince, <hi>the governor and thoſe he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to reſolved and practiſed to make all men's titles in effect quite null and void.</hi> The purchaſing of the natives right, was made nothing of, and next to a ridicule. The enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and improvement of lands not incloſed, and eſpecially if lying in common amongſt many was denied to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; it was not enough that ſome men that thought it convenient, and were both willing and able, did take confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of their lands, the numbers of whom in time might have been a conſiderable gain to them; but <hi>nothing would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy unleſs all in general might be compelled ſo to do; hence thoſe that refuſed were declared intruders upon his majeſty, and put in fear of having their lands granted unto ſtrangers.</hi> Many were ſolicited, and encouraged to petition for other men's lands, and had a ſhameful example ſet them by ſome of the chief contrivers of all this miſchief. <hi>When ſome men have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned for a confirmation of their own lands, a part of theſe only was offered to be granted to them, and another part denied.</hi> Nor could any man's own land be confirmed to him, without a particular ſurvey of every part and parcel of them firſt made, the great charges whereof, and of other fees to be taken would have been to moſt men inſupportable: <hi>Yea it hath by ſome been computed that all the money in the country would not ſuffice to patent the lands therein contained.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And yet further,</hi> a conſiderable quit-rent to the king was to be impoſed upon all lands, though already a conſtant yearly tax for the ſupport of the government had been laid on them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And for</hi> all this moſt unreaſonable vexation to a laborious and induſtrious people, the only ground pretended was ſome defects and wants of form and due manner alledged to be in the way of the diſpoſing and conveying of all lands from the patentees to the townſhips and people here; which whatever it amounted to might have been eaſily remedied, either by an application and repreſentation to the king for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a general ſettlement of all properties (which would have been highly worthy and generous for the governor to have engaged in, on behalf of the people) or by ſome other ways
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:012973_0056_0F90400B4F3B94F8"/>
that were propoſed. But nothing but the way of particular patenting as aboveſaid could prevail. In proſecution where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all actions intended upon informations of intruſions in his majeſty's behalf, or between old proprietors and new grantees muſt have had their deciſion at the ordinary courts of common law here upon the place where matters of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and of a conſideration tranſcending all ordinary caſes could not have a proper cognizance and due influence in the deciſion, determination and judgment.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Though</hi> ſufficient courts of juſtice were appointed, and held in the ſeveral counties for the trial of all offenders, yet it <hi>was too frequent upon more particular diſpleaſure to fetch up perſons from very remote counties before the governor and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at Boſton</hi> (who were the higheſt, and a conſtant court of record and judicature) not to receive their tryal but only to be examined there, and ſo remitted to an inferior court to be farther proceeded againſt. <hi>The grievance of which court was exceeding great,</hi> for hereby not only the charge was made exceſſive upon ſuch perſons by the <hi>notorious exactions of the meſſenger,</hi> the ſecretary's fees for examination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe examinations themſelves were unreaſonably ſtrict, and rigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and very unduly diſparing to plain unexperienced men. <hi>And</hi> the trials of ſeveral, were by this means over-ruled to be at <hi>Boſton,</hi> and not in the proper counties, and were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſo far prejudged as to be rendered leſs equal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> extraordinary oppreſſive fees taken in all matters by indigent and exacting officers, theſe were at the firſt for a long time arbitrarily impoſed and required without any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of an eſtabliſhment of them by the council. Afterwards a committee was appointed, to bring in a table of fees, that ſpent a long time without finiſhing any thing, the reaſon whereof was becauſe ſome therein <hi>eſpecially the deputy ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Weſt,</hi> inſiſted upon fees much more extraordinary than ſome others could conſent to. In concluſion; there was a table of fees drawn up to be preſented to the council, and ſigned by ſome of the committee, one of whom, (whoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription is to this paper) declaring expreſly, that by his ſigning he did no otherwiſe agree, but only that it might be preſented to the council, to do therein as they ſhould ſee cauſe, who alſo when it was ſo preſented to the council, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that many of the particulars in that table contained, were unreaſonable, and ought to be abated, and of this mind
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:012973_0057_0F90400C9F2528E8"/>
were many others. But the entry after the uſual manner was an approbation thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly.</hi> As to thoſe <hi>great jealouſies and ſuſpicions of ſiniſter deſigns in the governor as to our troubles by the Indians,</hi> we have to ſay, That although divers things too uncertain, if not untrue have been too eaſily reported and ſpread concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, a practice which ſome of us have formerly with no little prejudice to ourſelves diſcountenanced and borne teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony againſt; yet <hi>there have not wanted ſome other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars that might give too great a ground for the ſame.</hi> The principal of them (as far as we have any knowledge of things of that kind) are theſe.</p>
                  <p>The governor's <hi>ſeizing and taking away the goods of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur St.</hi> Caſtine <hi>of</hi> Penopſcot, the ſummer before the war broke forth, which thing hath been eſteemed not a little to have ſtirred up and furthered the ſucceeding troubles. The governor's not haſtening his return to <hi>Boſton</hi> when theſe troubles were actually begun, but lengthening out his tarrience in places ſo remote till the hoſtility of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and the great miſchiefs thereof were too far advanced. That during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence he was not pleaſed ſufficiently to impower and inſtruct any to act things neceſſary for the ſafety of the out plantations and the proſecution and ſuppreſſion of the enemy, tho' he had ſpeedy and true accounts from time to time ſent him of all that happened. That all that was done to this purpoſe in a caſe of ſuch neceſſity, either by the lieutenant governor, or by the juſtices of the peace, and military officers in many places, by ſecuring and diſarming of neighbouring <hi>Indians,</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up, warding and watching, garriſoning ſeveral houſes for the ſecurity of the inhabitants, eſpecially the women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in caſe of ſudden inroads and ſurprizings that might be, ſending ſome relief of men to ſome places that were moſt in danger, and alſo what was done by thoſe members of the council that were at <hi>Boſton</hi> in conjunction with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief left in the ſort there, who raiſed and ſent ſome forces to <hi>Caſco-Bay,</hi> where greateſt harms were done. We ſay, that all that was thus done, was ſo extreamly diſapprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by the governor upon his return back from <hi>Albany</hi> and <hi>New-York,</hi> and an unaccountable diſpleaſure manifeſted againſt all perſons that had ſo acted, and that he was ready to call them to an account as high offenders for the ſame, and refuſed a long time, though much ſolicited, to give any order concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoldiers ſent to <hi>Caſco,</hi> either for the continuance of them there, where they were very neceſſary, or for their diſmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:012973_0058_0F90400CC609C6C0"/>
home. Unto all which may be added the governor's ſending meſſengers both <hi>John Smith</hi> the quaker from <hi>Albany,</hi> and ſoon after Major <hi>Macgregory</hi> to <hi>Keybeck</hi> upon ſuch errands and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs as were not communicated and laid open to the council. And further, <hi>his releaſe and ſetting at liberty ſundry</hi> Indians <hi>that were in hold, ſome of them known enemies to the</hi> Engliſh, and particularly objected againſt by ſeveral of the council, and that without any exchange of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> captives then in the enemies hands.</p>
