            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE following pieces were originally addreſſed to the Editors of the Federal Gazette in Baltimore, and publiſhed in that paper. It being thought, by some persons whose opinion deserves respect, that a republication of them, in a form more connected, and more convenient for circulation and perusal, might be of use, they are now presented again to your conſideration.</p>
            <p>Their author is a person reſiding among you, whose present lot in life, as well as his future hopes, is embarked in the same bottom with yours; and who, therefore, has a common intereſt with you, in the great subject to which he calls your attention. It is by no means neceſſary that you ſhould know his name. It is not by the authority of names, but by truth, that the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of freemen ought to be guided. If opinions be founded in reason, and ſtatements supported by fact, it is of no importance by whom they are advanced.</p>
            <p>In attempting, however, to impress on your minds the neceſſity of adopting the legiſlative choice of electors, at this time, he thinks it important to declare to you, that he is decidedly in favor of diſtrict elections, whenever they can be permanently and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally eſtabliſhed. This can be done only by an amendment of the conſtitution. Such an amendment, he knows it to be the intention of a federal member of congress, with whom he is well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to propose at the next seſſion of that body. It may also be proposed by the legiſlature of Maryland. By inſtructing your members in the ensuing aſſembly to propose it, you may greatly promote its adoption by the other ſtates. Should it be adopted, of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037074_0004_100C46A744FD34D8"/>
which I think there is little doubt, all the ſtates will ſtand on equal ground, in the future elections of a chief magiſtrate for the nation. The people, in diſtricts, will every where choose the electors. The mode cannot be altered by one ſtate, as Virginia has lately done, in order to favor unduly the success of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular candidate. And the chief magiſtrate of the nation will be the fair choice of a majority of the nation.</p>
            <p>This will be the effect of eſtabliſhing, universally and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, the choice of electors by the people in diſtricts; and this is the wiſh of the federal party. They will exert themselves to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. But till it is obtained, while the friends of Mr. Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in one ſtate aboliſh diſtrict elections to favor him, I truſt that you will be convinced, by a candid perusal of the following pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, that it is both juſt and neceſſary for the friends of Mr. Adams, in this ſtate, to employ the same weapon in defending themselves, and in preventing the rights of the majority from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing usurped by the minority.</p>

               <p>THE alarm which the anti-federaliſts feel, at the idea of changing the mode of election in this ſtate, ſo as to counteract the policy of their party in Virginia, is perfectly natural and well founded—And their conduct, in attempting to raiſe a clamor againſt the meaſure, is altogether conſiſtent with the principles whereby their party has, at all times, been actuated. To change the mode of election in Virginia, ſo as to deprive the federaliſts in that ſtate of all ſhare in the choice of electors, was, as they well knew, the only ſtep which could give their party a chance of ſucceſs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they took it; and it was applauded by the party through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the union, as a maſter-ſtroke of policy. Blind and fooliſh as they are, they did not recollect, or did not foreſee, that the blow was capable of being retorted on their own heads.</p>
               <p>Finding now that this retort is likely to be made, they wake from their ſhort dream of ſucceſs, and cry out againſt the meaſure, as in the higheſt degree unjuſt. They now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a wonderful ſolicitude about the "rights of the people," which they ſay would be invaded and even deſtroyed, by the meaſure of chooſing electors by the legiſlature. Having firſt taken the ſtep themſelves, for their own benefit, they are now wonderfully alarmed leſt the federal party ſhould take it alſo, and thus reſtore the balance of fair choice.</p>
               <p>But they do not recollect, that the rights of the people are as effectually preſerved by a choice by the legiſlature, as in any other mode. The conſtitution is the work of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the expreſſion of their will, and the fence placed by themſelves round their rights. Nothing, therefore, which is expreſsly authoriſed by the conſtitution, can be contrary to the rights of the people. Whatever is done purſuant to the conſtitution, is their own act, flowing from their own authority, and therefore not only conſiſtent with their rights, but even an exerciſe of thoſe rights.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:037074_0006_100C46ABAA51F430"/>But the conſtitution provides, that the electors ſhall be appointed in ſuch mode as the legiſlature of each ſtate ſhall direct.—Conſequently, any manner of chooſing which the legiſlature ſhall direct, is conformable, and not contrary, to the rights of the people.</p>
               <p>Virginia, they tell us, did not reſort to a choice by the legiſlature, but only to a general ticket, which is ſtill a choice by the people, and therefore fair and proper. Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low pretext! Does not a general ticket in Virginia produce preciſely the ſame effect, that a choice by the legiſlature would have produced? Does it not as effectually deprive the federaliſts, who are the minority in the ſtate as well as in the legiſlature, of the ſix votes which they would have gained by the diſtrict election? Every man muſt ſee that it does, and that, therefore, there is no ſort of difference between the two modes, except that the choice by the legiſlature is attended with the leaſt trouble, tumult and inconvenience, and for that reaſon preferable to the other. The reſult is preciſely the ſame; but by the choice by the legiſlature, it is produced with leſs inconvenience than by a general ticket.</p>
               <p>Virginia, they further tell us, was not the firſt to take this ſtep. She was forced into it, in ſelf-defence, and in order to counteract the policy of other ſtates. But this is a miſtake in point of fact. Virginia ſet the example of chooſing the mode, with a view to a <hi>particular election,</hi> and to this particular election.—Pennſylvania had no eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed mode—ſhe had choſen in different ways at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent elections. The law under which the laſt choice was made, was a temporary law, and had expired when the legiſlature of that ſtate laſt met. The federal party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for a diſtrict election; that mode of which the anti-federaliſts of this ſtate are ſo greatly enamored. The anti-federaliſts in that ſtate, acting in perfect concert with thoſe of Virginia, oppoſed this faireſt of all poſſible modes of election, and oppoſed it with ſuch violence and obſtinacy, that they prevented any law from paſſing, and ſeem fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved rather to leave their ſtate without a vote, than to yield to diſtrict elections. So much for the attachment of the anti-federaliſts in Pennſylvania to this faireſt of all poſſible modes, with which the ſame party here are ſo much in love.</p>
               <p>Why are they in love with it here? Becauſe they expect
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037074_0007_100C46AD3013D898"/>
to gain ſome votes to their party by it. Why are they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to it in Pennſylvania and Virginia? Becauſe they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their party to loſe ſome votes by it there. The end therefore is the ſame, namely, to enſure the ſucceſs of their party, although the means are different: and their great ſolicitude for the "rights of the people" turns out, in this caſe as in ſo many others, to be nothing more than a deſire to promote their own views. Thoſe rights are ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed without the leaſt heſitation, whenever the ſacrifice can promote a party purpoſe.</p>
               <p>In all the other ſtates, except Pennſylvania, the mode of election was fixt, and the federaliſts were well content to let it remain ſo. They were content that this election ſhould be made, according to the ſame principles that governed the former. But the anti-federaliſts ſet the example of change, where it ſuited their purpoſe to make it. Having done ſo, they ſtickle violently to preſerve the old mode, where that happens to ſuit them beſt.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid by their advocates, that they attempted to change the mode in New-York, and to introduce a diſtrict election, inſtead of a choice by the legiſlature. This example is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate. The anti-federaliſts themſelves introduced the choice by the legiſlature in New-York, in ſpite of the efforts of the federaliſts; and their object was to promote the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of general Clinton, as vice-preſident, in oppoſition to Mr. Adams. When they found that this work of their own hands was likely to operate againſt themſelves, they wiſhed to change it, and to reſort again to diſtrict elections.</p>
               <p>We are told that the legiſlature of Maryland, at its laſt ſeſſion, had the general ticket ſcheme of Virginia before its eyes, and yet took no ſtep to counteract it; and this is uſed as an argument againſt calling the legiſlature. But here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain theſe ignorant perſons miſtake or miſtate the fact. The legiſlature of this ſtate never had the Virginia general ticket ſcheme before its eyes: It had adjourned long before that ſcheme was adopted in Virginia, and even before the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to adopt it was publicly avowed. The law for carrying it into effect, was one of the laſt acts of the ſeſſion. It was not introduced till a day or two before the adjournment, and then was hurried through with indecent haſte. We all know the feint that was practiſed, moſt probably with a view
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037074_0008_100C46AF76B280A0"/>
to deceive the legiſlature of Maryland, on the ſubject of this law. It was talked of; the pulſe of the legiſlature was felt; the ſcheme was well matured and completed. Now in order to gain time, and to deceive the oppoſite party, by which means ſome of them might be prevailed on to go home, its authors gave out that it was abandoned. One of their chiefs, colonel Taylor, carried his duplicity ſo far as actually to go home, giving out that he was gone for the ſeſſion. The ſcheme being ripe for execution, he ſuddenly returned, the bill was introduced, and puſhed through the two houſes with unprecedented celerity; and then the legiſlature adjourned. All this was ſome time after the legiſlature of this ſtate had adjourned. Conſequently, that body never had the meaſure under its eye, and nothing can be inferred from its omitting to take any countervailing ſtep.</p>
               <p>The truth of the whole matter is, and it need not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, that while the mode of chooſing electors remains on its preſent footing, variable according to the will of the ſtate legiſlatures, variations will be made, in ſome ſtates, to ſerve the canditate who may happen to be the favorite there. This has been done in Virginia. The anti-federaliſts began the game. Other ſtates muſt play it againſt them, in order to prevent the election from becoming perfectly unfair; from being controled by the minority. Maſſachuſetts has ſet the example of this retort; and the anti-federaliſts, awaking from their golden dream of power and office, begin to quake and cry out. Maryland, I have no doubt, will follow up the blow; in which caſe their defeat is certain. This they well know; and hence their new found ſolicitude for the "rights of the people," which they utterly diſregard, for diſtrict elections, which they firſt ſet aſide.</p>
               <p>Let an uniform and fixt mode of chooſing electors be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and the federaliſts will agree to it. They will even propoſe one themſelves, at the next ſeſſion of congreſs. All then will ſtand on the ſame ground; and the mode of choice cannot be changed to ſuit party purpoſes of the moment. But while this mode remains changeable, if one party be allowed to change it where it ſuits them, and to prevent change where the other party might gain by it, the election becomes manifeſtly unfair, in its general reſult, which is the only proper method of conſidering it; and the caſe put by

               <p>ON a former occaſion I pledged myſelf to prove, by a fair ſurvey of the continent, and a ſtatement of the ſtrength of parties in each ſtate, that if diſtrict elections for preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and vice-preſident were univerſally eſtabliſhed, which ought to be, and I truſt will be, done by an amendment of the conſtitution, Mr. Jefferſon could have no chance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elected; but on the contrary, that the reſult, in that caſe, would be far leſs favorable to his party, than even in caſe Maryland, to counteract the meaſures of his ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſhould adopt, for this time, the plan of chooſing by the legiſlature.</p>
               <p>Col.

federal party have always, till the preſent legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, poſſeſſed a clear and even a large majority in both branches. Even now they have a majority in the whole legiſlature; their majority in the ſenate being ſeven, and that of the anti-federaliſts in the other houſe, only two. But if we take the votes on the election for governor, as a fair criterion of the ſtrength of parties, we ſhall find that the anti-federaliſts are in the proportion of eight to ſeven. Mr. M'Kean had, I think, 38,000 votes, and Mr. Roſs 33,000. The difference, I perfectly recollect, was about 5000, not more, and the whole number about 70,000. It muſt be recollected, moreover, that the majority of Mr. M'Kean was given by the two inſurgent counties of Berks and Northampton, which were almoſt unanimous in his favor; and that in the reſt of the ſtate Mr. Roſs had a clear majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It is alſo to be remembered, that a majority of the counties was in favor of Roſs; and that a vaſt number of the votes for M'Kean, were obtained by the impoſitions practiſed on the Germans, relative to the houſe tax; which have ſince been detected and done away by the actual aſſeſſment. From theſe da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tums we may very ſafely conclude, that, by a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict election, the anti-federaliſts could not gain more than nine votes in Pennſylvania—that number we will allow them<note n="*" place="bottom">The fair calculation, indeed, is, that they could get but eight, eight to seven being their proportion, in the votes given for governor.</note>.</cell>

They have hopes of two other diſtricts. The cities of Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more and Annapolis, with the county of Anne-Arundel, compoſe one; the counties of Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Allegany the other. In the firſt of theſe they even affect to be confident; but their ſecret convictions are far different. They know that in the election between general Smith and Mr. Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, they had a majority in Baltimore town of on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 300, and that many who ſupported gen. Smith, are now decidedly for the federal elector. They alſo know that in the election between Mr. Thomas and Mr. Sprigg, there was in the city of Annapolis and Anne Arundel county, a much greater majority for the federal candidate; and that, conſequently, ſhould things remain as they were, the latter majority muſt overpower the former, and the federal elector be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. They therefore found their hopes, entirely, on the vain expectation of a change in their favor in the public ſentiment; of which there is not the leaſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect or appearance. As to Allegany and Waſhington, it is leſs certain. The former county is known to be nearly unanimous for the federal candidate, while the latter, which is much larger, and the ſtrong ground of the anti-federaliſts, is much divided. From this ſtate of things nothing certain can be concluded. At the laſt election, Mr. Lynn, of Allegany, who had but little ſtrength in Waſhington, was the federal candidate. The election was extremely cloſe, but he ſucceeded. In the preſent, Mr. Williams, of Waſhington, who is very ſtrong in that county, and will be as ſtrongly ſupported in Allegany, which is a moſt federal county, as Mr. Lynn himſelf, is the candidate; from which arrangement a much more
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037074_0013_100C46BAC89115B0"/>
favorable reſult than that of the laſt election, may be expected. Upon the whole we may conclude, that the anti-federaliſts have ſome chance, though but a ſmall one, in theſe two diſtricts; and that in the other two the probability is ſtrongly in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor. This will warrant the further concluſion, that no probable ground exiſts for the expectation, on their part, of more than three; and nothing like certainty of more than two. We will, however, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them three.</cell>

               <p>Thus it appears that were diſtrict elections univerſally eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed, the anti-federaliſts, on the moſt liberal allowance, could get but ſixty-three votes in all the ſtates, out of one hundred and thirty-eight, of which it requires ſeventy to make a majority. That is, that if the ſenſe of the nation could be expreſſed, by the faireſt of all poſſible modes, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral election by the people in diſtricts, there would be a large majority of the nation againſt that candidate, whom his friends are now attempting to ſmuggle in, by changing the mode of election from diſtricts to a general ticket, where it ſuits their views, and clamoring, at the ſame time, for diſtrict elections, where they hope to get ſomething by them.</p>
               <p>In Virginia they began the game. They took away the fair mode of diſtrict elections, and ſubſtituted a general tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, whereby the voice of ſix federal diſtricts was ſilenced in the election of preſident. In Pennſylvania they contended to the laſt for a general ticket, and refuſed to the federaliſts a diſtrict election, on the faireſt diviſion of the ſtate, which was repeatedly offered to them. A perſon, indeed, under the ſignature of "A Pennſylvanian," who is ſaid to be Mr. Dallas, has had the unaccountable effrontery to aſſert, in a paper of this city, that the anti-federaliſts in the Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia legiſlature, did not object to the principle of a diſtrict election, but to the mode of dividing the ſtate; an aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which that perſon himſelf, and every man in Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, knows to be falſe. In Maryland, on the contrary, theſe ſame friends to Mr. Jefferſon, hypocritically affect the moſt violent attachment to diſtrict elections, raiſe a loud clamor about the rights of the people, and contend, tooth and nail, for that very mode which their coadjutors have abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in Virginia, and prevented in Pennſylvania; hoping by theſe means to cheat the federal party, who conſtitute the majority in Maryland, as well as in the nation at large,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037074_0015_100C46BF21D7CD98"/>
out of their choice, out of their right, as a majority, to have a preſident of their choice, and to impoſe on the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a chief magiſtrate to whom the majority is unqueſtionably oppoſed. In a ſubſequent number, I will examine, more at length, this pretence about the rights of the people, whereby they are attempted to be cheated, in fact, out of their rights; and the foundations of this clamor, by which the good ſenſe of the majority is attempted to be impoſed on, and a preſident to be choſen by a factious minority. In the meantime, I will aſk the federaliſts in Maryland, who conſtitute the majority by the confeſſion even of their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, what is the right which they hold moſt dear? Is it not to have a preſident of their own choice? If ſo, will they ſuffer themſelves to be defrauded of this dear and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial right, by a few cant phraſes; by the artifices of the enemies of government in other ſtates, aided by their noiſy clamors in this?

This number is ſeven ſhort of a majority. The majority of the nation is therefore oppoſed to Mr. Jefferſon, and in favor of Mr. Adams, general Pinckney, or ſome other federal candidate.</p>
               <p>The anti-federaliſts of Virginia, who are a majority in that ſtate, knowing this to be the true ſtate of the matter, aboliſhed the diſtrict election in their ſtate; where Mr. Adams and general Pinckney would, upon that plan, have

got ſix votes at leaſt. By this ſtep they took ſix votes from thoſe candidates, and gave them to Mr. Jefferſon. Situated as the election actually is in the other ſtates, theſe ſix votes, taken from Mr. Jefferſon's opponents by depriving them of diſtrict elections, and added to him, will ſecure him the election, though the majority of the nation is againſt him; unleſs Maryland, where the federaliſts are a decided majority, ſhould take the ſame ſtep in her own defence. Unleſs by ſetting aſide diſtrict elections, for the preſent, Maryland ſhould deprive the anti-federaliſts of their influence in this ſtate, as the federaliſts of Virginia have been deprived of their influence in Virginia, and ſhould reſtore the election to its fair balance, the preſident of the United States will be choſen by the minority of the nation. This it is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the federaliſts of Maryland, that is of the majority, to do; not by ſtealth and underhandedly, but openly, upon fair and avowed principles, and with the concurrence of a majority of the people.</p>
               <p>The anti-federaliſts, alarmed at the idea of ſeeing their unjuſt advantage thus ſnatched out of their hands, and the election of preſident placed again under the controul of the majority, make a terrible outcry againſt this plan. They become, all at once, the zealous defenders of diſtrict elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; which they have ſo lately trampled under foot on the other ſide of the Potowmac, and do now obſtinately oppoſe in Pennſylvania. They ſay that the right to diſtrict electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they themſelves have aboliſhed in Virginia in order to promote the election of Mr. Jefferſon, and do now reſiſt in Pennſylvania for the ſame purpoſe, is a moſt ſacred right; and that an attempt to change them, even for this time alone and in order to counteract the plans of the ſame party in Virginia, ought to be treated by the people of Maryland, as an invaſion of their deareſt conſtitutional privileges.</p>
               <p>The foundations of this clamor I now intend to examine. I intend to enquire into the nature and extent of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional right.

                  <p>Let us in the firſt place aſk what is the conſtitutional right of the people, relative to the choice of preſident? I anſwer, their conſtitutional right is, to have the preſident choſen by electors appointed in each ſtate, "in ſuch manner as the legiſlature thereof ſhall direct."

                  <p>"The executive power ſhall be veſted in a preſident of the United States of America. He ſhall hold his office dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the term of four years; and, together with the vice-preſident, choſen for the ſame term, be elected as follows:</p>
                  <p>"Each <hi>ſtate</hi> ſhall appoint, <hi>in such manner as the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof may direct,</hi> a number of electors equal to the whole number of ſenators and repreſentatives to which the ſtate may be entitled in the congreſs, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>This is every word contained in the conſtitution, on the ſubject of appointing electors. Each <hi>ſtate,</hi> we ſee, not the people of each ſtate, but each <hi>ſtate</hi> in its united political capacity as a ſtate, is to appoint a certain number of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. And how are they to be appointed? By diſtricts? By a general ticket? By the legiſlature? No! But in ſuch manner <hi>as the legiſlature of the ſtate ſhall direct.</hi> So ſays the conſtitution. Such are its plain and expreſs words. The legiſlature of each ſtate, therefore, has a conſtitutional right, to direct the mode of appointing electors, and to direct it in whatever manner it ſhall think fit.</p>
                  <p>But no, ſay the anti-federaliſts, thoſe ſkilful expounders of the conſtitution. When the conſtitution ſays that "each <hi>ſtate</hi> ſhall appoint electors, it does not mean each ſtate in its political capacity as a ſtate—but the people of each ſtate, as individuals." Let us try this explanation by the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037074_0018_100C46C75F810C58"/>
itſelf, and by the conſtruction which it has received from the people of the ſeveral ſtates.</p>
                  <p>When the conſtitution means that the <hi>people</hi> of the ſtates ſhall act, it uniformly mentions the people. When it means to ſpeak of the ſtates in their political capacities, it always uſes the word <hi>"ſtates"</hi> alone.</p>
                  <p>Thus, in the 10th ſection of the 1ſt article: "<hi>No ſtate</hi> ſhall enter into any treaty of alliance," &amp;c. <hi>No ſtate</hi> ſhall, without the conſent of congreſs, lay impoſts, &amp;c. <hi>No ſtate</hi> ſhall, without the conſent of congreſs, lay any duty of tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage," &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>So in the 2d ſection of the 3d article: "The judicial power ſhall extend to controverſies between two or more <hi>ſtates,</hi> between a ſtate and citizens of another <hi>ſtate</hi>—and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>ſtate,</hi> or the citizens thereof, and foreign ſtates, citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens or ſubjects."</p>
                  <p>"In all caſes affecting ambaſſadors, other public miniſters, and conſuls, and thoſe in which a <hi>ſtate</hi> ſhall be party, the ſupreme court ſhall have original juriſdiction."</p>
                  <p>So in ſection 3d of the 4th article: "New <hi>ſtates</hi> may be admitted by congreſs into this union; but no new <hi>ſtate</hi> ſhall be formed or erected within the juriſdiction of any other <hi>ſtate,</hi> nor any ſtate be formed by the junction of two or more <hi>ſtates,</hi> or parts of <hi>ſtates,</hi> without the conſent of the legiſlatures of the ſtates concerned," &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>So in ſection 4th, ſame article: "The United States ſhall guarantee to every <hi>ſtate</hi> in this union a republican form of government," &amp;c. And in ſection 5th, "No <hi>ſtate,</hi> without its conſent, ſhall be deprived of its equal ſuffrage in the ſenate."</p>
                  <p>So in the 9th ſection of the 1ſt article: "The migration or importation of ſuch perſons as any of the <hi>ſtates</hi> now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting ſhall think proper to admit, ſhall not be prohibited," &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In all theſe inſtances, it is perfectly clear, that the word <hi>ſtate</hi> is uſed to ſignify, not the <hi>people</hi> of the ſtate, but the ſtate itſelf, in its collective capacity, as a community and body politic. When the conſtitution, therefore, uſing the ſame expreſſion, ſays, that "<hi>each ſtate</hi> ſhall appoint electors, in ſuch manner as the legiſlature thereof ſhall direct," does it not evidently intend to convey the ſame meaning,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037074_0019_100C325AED0ECE28"/>
and to ſpeak of the ſtate in its political capacity? Does it, contrary to its conſtant tenor and meaning in every other part, intend to ſay that the <hi>people</hi> of each ſtate, individually, ſhall appoint electors? When it means to introduce the <hi>people</hi> in their individual capacity, what is its language? Let it ſpeak for itſelf.</p>
                  <p>Section 2. article 1. "The houſe of repreſentatives ſhall be compoſed of members choſen every ſecond year, by the <hi>people of the several ſtates.</hi>" Is this the ſame language? Does it convey the ſame meaning? If the conſtitution had meant that the electors, as well as the repreſentatives, ſhould be choſen by the <hi>people</hi> of the ſeveral ſtates, would it not have ſaid ſo, in expreſs terms, in one caſe, as well as in the other? Certainly it would.</p>
                  <p>We are therefore warranted to conclude, that as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution has provided, not that the <hi>people</hi> of the ſeveral ſtates ſhould chooſe electors, but that each <hi>ſtate</hi> ſhould chooſe them, it meant, in this inſtance, as in every other where the ſame expreſſion is uſed, to ſpeak of the ſtate in its collective political capacity, and to provide that there ſhould be a certain number of electors for each ſtate, and that the legiſlature thereof ſhould direct, in whatever man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it might think fit, the mode of making the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>"Each <hi>ſtate</hi> ſhall appoint, in ſuch manner as the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof may direct, a number of electors equal," &amp;c. Is not this, when compared with the conſtitution itſelf, and the language uſed by it in every other part, ſo plain that he who runs may read?</p>
                  <p>What has been the conſtruction put on it by the ſtates? Surely their opinions, not warped by particular objects and the purpoſes of the moment, but deliberately and uniformly expreſſed, will be allowed to poſſeſs ſome weight in a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion like this.</p>
                  <p>There have already been three elections of preſident. In all of them, South-Carolina has choſen the electors by the legiſlature. Tenneſſee having been but lately erected into a ſtate, has choſen but once, and then it was by the legiſlature. In all three, Jerſey and Delaware have choſen by the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature. In the two laſt, certainly, and I believe in all three, New-York has choſen by the legiſlature. Every
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037074_0020_100C46CB35E20D58"/>
choice that Rhode-Iſland has made, if I recollect aright, has been by the legiſlature. At the laſt election, and I think at ſome of the former, Maſſachuſetts choſe part of her electors by the legiſlature.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee, that out of ſixteen ſtates, ſeven, not under the influence of any particular project, not with a view to any party election, but freely and impartially, have adopted the mode of appointing electors by the legiſlature; thereby declaring, in the moſt authoritative manner, their opinion about the true meaning of the conſtitution. This declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the people of thoſe ſtates have approved; for otherwiſe, they would have expreſſed their diſcontent; and by electing different perſons into the legiſlature, would have cauſed the adoption of a different mode.</p>
                  <p>Two other ſtates, New-Hampſhire and Vermont, are ſaid, and I believe truly, to have lately adopted the ſame mode; not in order to ſecure all the votes to the federal intereſt, for of that they were ſure, by the eſtabliſhed mode of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ticket; but for the purpoſe of preventing votes from being thrown away from either of the federal candidates. Thus nine ſtates have concurred in this conſtruction of the conſtitution; which indeed, as we have ſeen, is ſo plain from the face of the inſtrument itſelf, that one is at a loſs to conceive, how it could ever have been called into queſtion.</p>

                     <hi>PART SECOND.</hi> That the subſtantial conſtitutional Right of the People of Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the Right to have a Preſident chosen by the Majority, is in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vaded by diſtrict Elections; and can be reſtored only by a Legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative choice of Electors.</head>
                  <p>I moſt readily admit that the people have a right, a moſt undoubted right, under the conſtitution, not indeed to vote immediately in the choice of electors, but to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſubſtantially, and direct, not only that choice, but the choice of preſident alſo. The preſident is the elective chief magiſtrate of the nation. He ought to be choſen by the majority of the nation. The ſenſe of that majority ought to be fairly expreſſed. This is the real ſubſtantial right of the people. To have a chief magiſtrate who is the choice of the majority; not to chooſe electors in this,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037074_0021_100C46CE2717FAF8"/>
that or the other manner, or to vote for this, that or the other man as an elector. The latter is the ſhadow; about which none but children or blockheads can be ſolicitous, nor any but deſigning party-men would make a fuſs. The former, to have a preſident of their choice, is the ſubſtance; and whatever tends to ſecure that ſubſtance, to promote that choice, promotes, inſtead of ſubverting, the "rights of the people."</p>
                  <p>People of Maryland, who is your choice as preſident? Whom do you wiſh to have as chief magiſtrate? You an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, at leaſt a large majority of you, who muſt ſpeak for the whole, anſwer, Mr. Adams or general Pinckney.— Whom do you wiſh to prevent from being elected preſident? The ſame majority anſwers, Mr. Jefferſon. Who are they then, who wiſh to take from you your rights? Thoſe who have deſtroyed diſtrict elections on the other ſide of the Potomak, in order to ſecure the election of Mr. Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, while they loudly clamor for them here for the ſame purpoſe; or thoſe who wiſh, by introducing the choice by the legiſlature, to replace the election in the hands of the majority, and continue Mr. Adams, the man of your choice, in the preſidential chair? Turn then, with juſt diſdain from the noiſy, deceitful, deſigning demagogue, who proves that he holds your rights and your underſtandings in equal contempt, by endeavoring to impoſe on the one, in order to beguile you of the other; by endeavoring to pay you for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with words; to perſuade you that in order to preſerve the right of voting in a particular mode, you muſt ſubmit to have thoſe votes rendered abſolutely ineffectual, and a chief magiſtrate impoſed on you, who are the majority, by the tricks and clamors of a profligate minority.</p>
                  <p>Is there any man in any diſtrict or county of Maryland, who wiſhes for the election of Mr. Adams, who prefers him to Mr. Jefferſon, and yet does not ſee that his rights, which are to have a chief magiſtrate of his own choice, are ſubſtantially promoted and ſecured by whatever conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal meaſure tends to ſecure the man of his choice? Is there any Marylander, who prefers Mr. Adams to Mr. Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and is yet ſo fooliſhly attached to voting at a particular election, as to ſacrifice the former object in order to retain the latter? Is there any ſuch Marylander, who can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037074_0022_100C325E04454EB8"/>
by the advocates of Mr. Jefferſon, to ſell his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right for a meſs of pottage? Why does he wiſh to vote? Is it that he may go to the polls, and pronounce the name of Jeremiah Townley Chaſe, of Philip Thomas, or of any other perſon; or that he may promote the election of Mr. Adams as preſident, in preference to that of Mr. Jefferſon? If the latter be his object, ſurely the moſt effectual ſteps for attaining it, muſt be the moſt conformable to his wiſhes, and to his rights.</p>
                  <p>The preſident is the elective chief magiſtrate of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ought, therefore, to be the fair choice of a majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the nation. Diſtrict elections, I know, are, in themſelves, the faireſt mode of expreſſing that choice; but in order to be fair, they muſt be general and permanent. If one ſtate can change from a diſtrict election to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ticket, or a legiſlative choice, and not another, the election becomes unfair, and the minority may chooſe inſtead of the majority. Of this any one may be convinced, by a very ſimple illuſtration.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe three neighboring ſtates, like Delaware, Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Virginia, to form a ſeparate union, to have three votes each for preſident, and to elect by diſtricts. There will be nine votes in all, and five will be a majority. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that in Virginia two are for Mr. Jefferſon and one for Mr. Adams, and in Maryland two for Mr. Adams and one for Mr. Jefferſon, and in Delaware two for Mr. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams and one for Mr. Jefferſon. Or in figures thus:

                  <p>In giving Mr. Jefferſon 2 votes by diſtricts in Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, and 3 in Maryland, we allow him the utmoſt to which his partizans lay claim.

                  <p>Virginia, underſtanding this matter, alters the mode of election, aboliſhes diſtrict elections, and thus takes from Mr. Adams his 6 votes in Virginia, and gives them to Mr. Jefferſon. The poll, then in thoſe 3 ſtates, ſtands thus:

                  <p>The balance, even then, will not be completely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.

                  <p>But ſhould the ſtate of Maryland ſuffer itſelf to be bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied out of its rights as a ſtate, by the clamors of the partizans of Virginia; ſhould the majority of the people of Maryland, who are friendly to the adminiſtration, and deſirous of the re-election of Mr. Adams, ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be tricked out of their right to a preſident of their own choice, by the artifices of the minority, Mr. Jefferſon's adherents? then will fraud be triumphant over right, the fair voice of the nation will be ſuppreſſed, and a man be placed in the preſidential chair, contrary to the wiſhes of the American people.</p>
                  <p>This muſt be the conſequence of ſuffering diſtrict electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to remain in Maryland, while they are aboliſhed in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia. Yet this conſequence, we are told, muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, becauſe to change the mode of election, and adopt the legiſlative choice, would be an invaſion of the rights of the people! In order to preſerve their right of voting, their votes, when given, muſt be rendered ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al! In order to preſerve their right of voting, they muſt be deprived of the right of having a preſident of their own choice, and compelled to take one who is the choice of the minority!

                     <hi>PART THIRD.</hi> That if the Electors are appointed by the Legiſlature, ſtill both they and the Preſident will be chosen by the people, who elect the members of the Legiſlature.</head>
                  <p>But how are the people deprived of their right of vot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by transferring the choice of electors, from diſtricts to the legiſlature? Do not the people chooſe the members of that legiſlature by which the choice of electors is made? Do they not chooſe thoſe members with a direct view to that choice of electors? And do they not, in this way, as effectually influence the election of preſident, as if they themſelves choſe the electors? Moſt certainly they do. Let us take Ann-Arundel county, as an inſtance, or Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timore county. The people of Anne-Arundel county, a large majority of them at leaſt, are in favor of Mr. Adams as preſident, in preference to Mr. Jefferſon. They will vote for Mr. Chaſe, ſhould diſtrict elections remain. Why will they vote for Mr. Chaſe? Becauſe they know that he, as an elector, will vote for Mr. Adams. Their object, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is to promote the election of Mr. Adams. If, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, inſtead of voting for Mr. Chaſe, in order that he may, if choſen, vote for Mr. Adams, they ſhould vote for Dr. Wharfield, major Brogden, Mr. Worthington and Mr. Weems, who as members of the legiſlature will chooſe an elector that will vote for Mr. Adams, do they not as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually influence and promote the election of Mr. Adams in one caſe as in the other? Is not the preſident as much choſen by them in one caſe as in the other? How then are they deprived of their right of voting in the election of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident? In either caſe, they chooſe the men by whom the preſident is choſen. The only difference is, that in one caſe they vote for four men who will chooſe Mr. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams as preſident, and in the other caſe they vote for one man who will chooſe Mr. Adams as preſident. The reſult is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the ſame, as far as reſpects the influence of the people in the election. In both caſes they ſubſtantially chooſe the preſident, by chooſing the men by whom he is to be choſen, and chooſing them with an expreſs view to that choice. In one caſe, moreover, they have the trouble of two elections; firſt for members of aſſembly and ſecondly for electors; whereas in the other, one election is ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="unknown:037074_0028_100C46DB19C2E4F8"/>And yet there are perſons who hold the underſtandings of the people in ſuch contempt, as to tell them, that they will be deprived of their votes in the election of preſident, by transferring the choice of the electors from themſelves to the legiſlature, whoſe members they themſelves are to chooſe!</p>
                  <p>There is one other argument of moſt concluſive force, for the legiſlative choice, to the people of Baltimore, Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gany and Anne-Arundel counties. In each of thoſe three counties there is a majority of federaliſts. If, therefore, the electors are choſen by the legiſlature, the federal majorities in thoſe three counties, will have their due weight in the election of electors and of preſident: for they will each chooſe four members of the legiſlature; and thoſe members will have an equal vote with the members of any other counties in the choice of electors. Of conſequence, thoſe counties will have as much influence in the election of preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as any other three counties in the ſtate.</p>
                  <p>But how will it be if the diſtrict election ſhould continue? Allegany is united in the ſame diſtrict with Waſhington. In Waſhington there is an anti-federal majority, which may overbear the federal majority of Allegany; and in that caſe the county of Waſhington chooſes the elector, and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gany is deprived of all influence in the election of preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The ſame obſervation applies to Anne-Arundel county, which is united in the ſame diſtrict with Baltimore town; and to Baltimore county, which is united with Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. In caſe of a diſtrict election, thoſe two counties may be deprived of all influence in the choice of preſident; ſince their federal majorities may be overpowered by the anti-federal majorities of Baltimore town and Harford county: whereas ſhould the legiſlature appoint the electors, their members will have their due weight in the appointment, and of courſe in the election of preſident.</p>
                  <p>The remark will alſo apply to the city of Annapolis, which is connected, in the diſtrict election, with Baltimore town: and perhaps to Talbot county; where there is reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the majority is federal, and will be overborne by the anti-federal county of Queen-Anne.</p>

                  <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
                  <p>Why then, people of Maryland, are the advocates of Mr. Jefferſon ſo clamorous in favor of diſtrict elections here, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037074_0029_100C46DCB630A288"/>
having aboliſhed them in Virginia, and ſucceſsfully op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed their eſtabliſhment in Pennſylvania! Is it from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the rights of the people, about which they affect to have become, all on a ſudden, ſo zealous! No, no. The veil is too thin to reſiſt the moſt ordinary penetration. If they were indeed actuated by a ſacred regard to the rights of the people, they would wiſh to ſee the ſenſe of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority prevail. If they were indeed actuated by a ſacred regard to the rights of the people, they would make no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to deprive the people, under flimſy pretexts, of their only valuable ſubſtantial right, their right to a preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of their choice! If they were indeed of opinion that diſtrict elections are a ſacred right of the people, they would not have aboliſhed them in Virginia, and prevented them in Pennſylvania! They would not contend for one right on one ſide of the Potowmac, and for another right on the other ſide! Whence then their new-found and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous zeal for diſtrict elections; with the vital blood of which the hands of their friends beyond the Potowmac are ſtill reeking? The ſecret lies here. They know that by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict elections in this ſtate, Mr. Jefferſon might get two or three votes, and therefore they ſtruggle to retain them. They knew that by diſtrict elections in Virginia, Mr. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams would have obtained ſix or eight votes there; and therefore they exultingly aboliſhed them in Virginia. They know that by diſtrict elections in Pennſylvania, Mr. Adams would divide that ſtate with Mr. Jefferſon, and probably get a majority: and therefore they oppoſe their eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there; in hopes of at length wearying out the fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts, and obtaining a general ticket, whereby all the votes would be ſecured to their candidate. This is the true ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of their conduct, and not an attachment to diſtrict e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, or the rights of the people; for both of which they manifeſt the utmoſt contempt, whenever it ſuits their purpoſe to trample them under foot.</p>
                  <p>Their real object is to ſecure the election of their candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, by all means, fair or foul; to impoſe him on the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as preſident, contrary to the clear and known wiſh of the majority; to ſtifle the voice of that majority, by arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in one ſtate, clamors in another, and the violation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very right in a third; while diſtrict elections are their

ſtalking horſe, and a clamor about the rights of the people is the inſtrument wherewith they work.</p>
                  <p>People of Maryland, diſtruſt ſuch clamors. When the wolf, with his jaws ſtill red with the gore of the lamb, affects an extraordinary ſolicitude about the ſafety of the ſheepfold, believe that he is as much in earneſt, as the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents of Mr. Jefferſon are, when they affect an ardent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to diſtrict elections on one ſide of the Potowmac, after having juſt finiſhed their deſtruction on the other ſide. The clamor about diſtrict elections and the rights of the people, coming from ſuch a quarter, is moſt evidently intended as a cloak to conceal the moſt fatal attack that can be made on your rights; an attack on your right to a chief magiſtrate choſen by the majority of the nation. This is the great eſſential right, for the preſervation of which, all ſubordinate rights are inſtituted. Diſtruſt the men who adviſe you to adhere to the latter at the expence of the former. While that great right, the right of being govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a chief magiſtrate choſen by the majority, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to you unimpaired, your liberties will be ſafe. Let that once be ſnatched from you; let the choice of chief magiſtrate once be transferred from the majority to the minority; and whether it be done by fraud or by force, by the violence of ſtrangers, or the artifices of ſome among yourſelves; the effect is the ſame. Your ſolid valuable rights are annihilated; all that could diſtinguiſh you as freemen diſappears; and your boaſted liberty becomes an unſubſtantial name, "the baſeleſs fabric of a viſion."</p>
                  <p>I have now, Meſſrs. printers, executed as well as I am able, the taſk which I ſometime ago undertook. I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted it with a zeal inſpired by truth, and warmed by the cauſe for which I contend, the rights of the majority, and the fair choice of a chief magiſtrate by the ſuffrage of the American people. Whatever ſucceſs may attend my feeble exertions, I ſhall enjoy the ſatisfaction reſulting from a conſciouſneſs of having diſcharged my duty, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my ſtation, and to the beſt of my abilities; and confiding the event to that Providence, which in ſo many trying emergencies, has watched over the deſtinies of the American nation, I ſhall remain a reſigned, though anxious</p>
