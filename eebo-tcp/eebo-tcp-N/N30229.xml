            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>EADING in ſome of the News-Papers, the laſt ſitting of the Honourable Aſſembly of this Province, of a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſign'd by a great Number of the Freeholders of this Town, was preſented to the Court, for Relief under their preſent difficult and diſtreſſing Circumſtances, for want of a ſufficient Medium; whereby the Trade and Buſineſs of the Town is very much decayed, Law-Suits increaſed, and Caſh to purchaſe the Neceſſaries of Life hard to be attained, even by many of good Eſtates among them. It muſt plainly appear, to a Mathematical Demonſtration, that nothing can help or relieve this Town out of its preſent great Difficulties and bad Circumſtances, but Frugality and Induſtry, and purſuing juſt and reaſonable Schemes. For any reaſonable Man living to think that the Printing a few Rheams of Paper, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Shadow of Foundation, and calling it Money, will relieve them, they are vaſtly miſtaken, it will only lead them into a vaſt Labyrinth of Evils.</p>
            <p>THE following Scheme will appear to a full Demonſtration what vaſt Service it will be to this Town.</p>
            <p>IT muſt be allowed that a Number can perform more than a few, which is juſt and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

who have got Money by their firſt Scheme: Their Maxims are thus, when they have a Mind to bring any Manufactury into their Country, they always procure the beſt Workmen from that Country where that Manufactury is carried on to the utmoſt Perfection. Having procured Workmen, they perform to thoſe Men their Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Contracts to the leaſt Tittle: And thoſe Workmen finding themſelves juſtly dealt withal, they directly bring that Manufactury to as great Perfection as it is carried on in the Country they came from. And thus from theſe wiſe Maxims, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> have followed, they have brought them to that glorious Figure which they now make in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>NOW to my Scheme.</hi> There is the compleateſt Place for the Erecting and Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Twenty Mills on of any Place I ever ſaw in my Life; it is from the Warehouſe of JO<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>OUR <hi>Mother</hi> Country will be much pleas'd with this Scheme, becauſe not one Mill will interfere with any of the Manufactur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It's plain to a Demonſtration, that thoſe Corn Mills which are erected on the Mill Pond, will in a few Years be of no Service. The Reaſon is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Pond fills ſo faſt with Filth, that there will not be ſufficient Water to carry on the ſaid Mills. And ſuch a fine, beautiful Tract of Land will be more fit to build Streets of Houſes on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ten Times the Improvement than they are at preſent em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in. And theſe Corn Mills (to be built on the aforementioned Place) may be built to the ſame Advantage as they are now in <hi>England.</hi> The Corn Mills have been vaſtly improved in <hi>England</hi> within theſe Twenty Years. And thoſe Mills being built to the ſame Perfection they are now built in <hi>England,</hi> they will grind more Flour by ſix lb. Weight out of a Buſhel of Wheat, and make better Flour, than any Mill now built in <hi>America.</hi> (For all the Mills now built in <hi>America,</hi> are built in the old Form) So that the Merchants of <hi>Boſton</hi> may purchaſe Wheat from the Wheat Countries, and ſupply the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> Cheaper than either <hi>New-York</hi> or <hi>Philadelphia.</hi> For the Tenth of theſe Fac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is now an abſolute Neceſſity for coming into a juſt Scheme in order to have Money paſs for a Supply of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Neceſſities, till ſuch time as by our Frugality and Dent of Induſtry we bring Silver and Gold to paſs as a proper Medium; which was the real Deſign of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

the Parliament for the Drawback to be taken off, it would be done, and a Royal Bounty granted: And the Gentlemen of this Province coming to a juſt Way of thinking, they might flow in Riches as they pleaſe. And theſe Gentlemen or Society that are concerned in the aforementioned Mills, might directly bring this Scheme of the Pot-Aſh to Perfection; and what glorious Farms would be produced from this Scheme of Pot-Aſh?</p>
            <p>I had almoſt forgot to mention one more great Benefit to this great Town of <hi>Boſton</hi> in the building theſe Mills, which all Mankind muſt allow to be juſt; that is thus, Suppoſe it ſhould happen a War, by having ſuch a fine Communication with the Caſtle, we might ſoon ſupply that Fortreſs with Ten Thouſand brave Fellows that would face any Enemy on the whole Earth. And by this Scheme the great Town of <hi>Boſton</hi> may be made impregnable. We may ſee to what a glorious Spirit the Engliſh Nation are arrived to, in improving every Thing that's poſſible to be done for the Good of the Publick; witneſs the advancing 700,000 <hi>l.</hi> towards building a Bridge from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> acroſs to <hi>Lambeth</hi>; and there is no Gentlemen, that are thinking Men, but knows the Profits ariſing by Tole of the ſaid Bridge will not bring in more than Two per Cent Intereſt; but they all know it's for the Good of their Country, therefore they ſee it neceſſary it ſhould be done notwithſtanding the Inſufficiency of the Premium for ſuch a vaſt Undertaking. Therefore as the aforementioned Mills can be mathematically proved, to produce Twenty per Cent. it will be look'd upon in <hi>England,</hi> if it is not done, that the Gentlemen of this Country do not conſult their own Intereſt and the general Good the whole Country will reap therefrom. And for any Perſon or Perſons to ſend Home any diſmal Complaint of the State of the Province, it will be look'd upon as only noiſy Faction and Clamour.</p>
            <p>I have been always ſuprized to think what vaſt Improvements have been performed by the Gentlemen of this Province in one Century. But now, provided our young Nobility, Gentry and Farmers come over, with their Pockets full of Money, what vaſt Improvements may be expected in the next Century.</p>
            <p>I don't in the leaſt doubt but theſe fifteen Colonies will arrive to as great a Pitch of Glory as thoſe fifteen Provinces of <hi>China.</hi> And as Sir WILLIAM TEMPLE ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth, it muſt be allowed to be the greateſt, richeſt and moſt populous Kingdom now known in the World; and will be found perhaps to owe its Riches, Force, Civility and Felicity to the admirable Conſtitution of its Government, more than any other. The Empire conſiſts of fifteen ſeveral Kingdoms, which are govern'd by Vice-Roys, who yet live in Greatneſs, Splendor and Riches, equal to great and ſovereign Kings. In the whole Kingdom there are 145 Capital Cities, of mighty Extent and magnificent Buildings; and 1321 leſſer Cities, but all walled round; the Number of Villages is infinite: And no Country in the known World is ſo full of Inhabitants, nor ſo improved by Agriculture and Manufacturies, by infinite Growth of numerous Commodies, by Canals of incredible Length, Conjunction of Rivers, by Convenience of Ways for the Tranſportation of all Sorts of Goods from one Province to another; ſo as no Country has ſo great a Trade.</p>

Labour and Pains in ſerving this moſt noble Province. Mankind nothing more imitates almighty God, than by rewarding thoſe that lay out their Powers and Faculties in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Mankind, This <hi>Coaſting Pilot</hi> gives me a juſt Idea of the Coaſt of his Majeſty's Provinces from <hi>New-York</hi> to the Bay of <hi>Funday.</hi> The very Iſlands are able to contain Millions of People; which abſolutely deſtroys that vile ſelfiſh Principle of ſome People which ſay they are not for Strangers coming amongſt them, becauſe they ſhall not have Land enough for their Children; which is really a childiſh Story.</p>
            <p>UPON moderate Computation the Gentlemen Farmers have borrowed on Bond and Mortgages upwards of <hi>Five hundred thouſand Pounds</hi>; of which the greateſt Part is let at 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> And according to the preſent Scituation of Affairs, it is impoſſible for thoſe Gentlemen to pay off their Securities: So that a Gentleman that has Mortgaged his Form for 500 <hi>l.</hi> that is worth 2000, his Farm on Proſecution is certainly forfeited for want of the 500 <hi>l.</hi> And its impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe whilſt the griping Uſurers Monopolizes into their own Coffers, the Bulk of that ſmall Quantity of running Specie that is now Extant amongſt us. And as the old ſaying is, The juſt Value of any Commodity whatever, is what it will fetch. The only Remedy to avoid this great Evil, is for the Aſſembly of this Province, as I obſerved before, to lay juſt Schemes, to perſwade and allure our young Nobility, Gentry and Farmers to come and ſettle among us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, and it's not to be doubted, but theſe Gentlemen would purchaſe the Farms of thoſe Gentlemen that have involved themſelves, and are now in a State of Bondage; and they may put Money ſufficient in their Pockets to proceed on the Settlement of new Farms on the out Lands, with Reſolution and Vigour. And in a few Years, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nduſtry, they will have as good Farms as they at firſt parted with, and an entire Freedom from the grand Oppreſſion they then labour'd under. And upon the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of a Number of our young Nobility and Farmers, with a Quantity of Money, it would make it a Year of Jubilee for all thoſe Gentlemen that now labour under the preſent grand Oppreſſions. For all Gentlemen well knows what a vaſt Number of Farms muſt be put to Sale in few Years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And no Purchaſers can appear to buy of theſe Country People The Reaſon is, becauſe they will not have Money to pay for them. And further, I obſerve to the Gentlemen Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
