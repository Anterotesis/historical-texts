            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>WHEN the Lord our God plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe Heavens, and laid the foundations of this Earth, and ſaid to</hi> New England, <hi>Thou art my People</hi>: I mean when he firſt Founded and Erected, both an Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Conſtitution here; together and at once; and thereby made us not only a People, but <hi>His People</hi>; he put it into the hearts of his Servants in both Orders to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour a Coalition of both thoſe fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Intereſts, (<hi>viz</hi>) that of Heaven, and that of Earth; which is to ſay, that of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and that of Civil Government, that the latter might be ſanctified by the former, and our Churches and People be confirmed

and flouriſh, with both temporal and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Proſperities, under a concurrence &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of all the bleſſings of both. Hence the firſt original, and long continuance of our Religious Solemnities, Celebrated by the Word of God, Prayer, and Praiſe, on the morning of our <hi>Aniverſary Dayes of Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion,</hi> in order to the more ſolemn and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful management of that great Affair of thoſe days, under the propitious aſpect of Heaven, by Divine Counſel and Conduct, unto ſuch an happy Choice as might make ſufficient proviſion for ſuch an Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Government ſucceſſively, as may be effectual unto the preſervation &amp; promotion of our publick Weal, in all the reſpects of it, both Civil and Sacred; and in this way of waiting upon God, his People heretofore have obtained ſignal inſtances of his Favour, Grace, and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; and which are hitherunto continued in a degree above our deſerts; yet not without a very humbling diminution of our joy and comfort, from a ſenſe of our own ſinfulneſs and unworthineſs, and of Gods holy and juſt (though very ſevere) diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, moved thereby, eſpecially ſince he hath entred into, and ſo long continued in, a way of Judgment with us; in which proceſs he hath cauſed us to paſs under divers very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive

and humbling Changes and Bereave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and to ſee and feel things hard to bear: It concerns us therefore to know and acknowledge, and to be very humbly and penitentially ſenſible, that our not hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto, and not obeying the voice of the Lord our God by his Miniſtry, hath been the radical cauſe of that detection in the life and power of Religion, whereby our God hath been ſo far provoked againſt us; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that we have given no more profitable effectual attention, unto thoſe more awful awakening voices of his unto all <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> uttered with the greateſt ſolemnity in our <hi>Election Sermons,</hi> delivered with much evidence of the Preſence and Aſſiſtance of the Spirit, in the moſt publick Audience of our Great and General Aſſemblies, wherein God hath commanded his Servants to <hi>Cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, and not to ſpare, to lift up their voices like Trumpets to ſhew us his people our tranſgreſſions and our ſins,</hi> and whereby he hath plainly charged us with, powerfully convinced us of, juſtly and ſeverely judged, condemned, and dreadfully denounced againſt us for thoſe tranſgreſſions and ſins, more eſpecially thoſe ways of ſinning wherein we have been forſaking of him, and breaking covenant with him, and thereby exchanging our Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (even our God for that which doth not

And all this (before he actually engaged <hi>in pleading of his Controverſy (which is the Quarrel of his Covenant</hi>) with us by theſe his moſt eminent Servants, by whoſe Miniſtry and Service he firſt tranſported his Goſpel and Kingdom into this part of the world, who (as moſt able and faithful watchmen) diſcovered, declared and gave timely, both general and particular warning of, &amp; againſt all dangerous evils of ſin preſent &amp; prevailing; &amp; all thoſe Judgments impending &amp; approaching, which God hath ſince executed upon us; ſo that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' our Fathers &amp; Prophets have faithfully ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified their Teſtimony &amp; are removed yet we have been &amp; are forced to own and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>that Gods word which he commanded them to deliver hath taken bold &amp; that as God thought</hi> (&amp; by them ſaid he would) <hi>do unto us, ſo be hath dealt with us</hi>; and altho' God hath gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly granted to us ſome reſpite by an interim of outward peace, &amp; proſperity, for

our farther probation; yet we perſiſting in our former ways of tranſgreſſion &amp; provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may fear (if not conclude) that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy will not be iſſued with us, nor our Salvation perfected &amp; confirmed, in ſaving mercy; <hi>until we have heard &amp; obeyed the words which the Lord hath cried to us by the voice of thoſe former Prophets</hi>; &amp; until they have had their ſaving efficacy and effect upon us in a general Converſion &amp; Reformation: In the mean time we have great cauſe, and much matter of thankfulneſs unto our moſt gracious &amp; merciful God, that he hath not only ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us &amp; ſaved us from general deſtructions &amp; deſolations, &amp; from overwhelming, overtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Changes. But that he hath continued us in the peaceable poſſeſſion of his houſe, and all the furniture of it, his Word, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Miniſtry, Adminiſtrations, according to Divine Inſtitutions, with ſo much of the Spirit, &amp; Power thereof as doth remain, tho' not without very humbling declenſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; &amp; with ſo much of the ſpiritual &amp; graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence of God, as he is yet pleaſed to continue, tho' not without very ſad &amp; ſignal degrees of Deſertion, by the gradual removes of the Glory: As alſo for that God hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us ſuch a Civil Government, &amp; hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſo far provided for the juſt &amp; righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Adminiſtration thereof: That we have
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000968_0008_0FAE3999D86112D8"/>
made no better improvement for the time we have enjoyed ſo great a benefit, may have moved God in diſpleaſure to remove that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſonage &amp; great Patriot whom he had made Governour &amp; Commander in Chief with us; &amp; alſo to threaten us with a further (&amp; in that reſpect) a greater breach, by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that Honourable &amp; Excellent Perſon yet ſurviving in Chief place of Government, but living &amp; languiſhing under very doubtful &amp; dangerous ſymptoms: Surely God having ſo eminently qualified him with Wiſdom and grace, and thereby made him ſo great a Benefactor and Bleſſing to his People and Churches here, 'tis our duty to give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the glory thereof with great thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, for the great and publick benefit of the long labour of his life paſt, and to pray ſincerely and fervently for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continuance of both.</p>
            <p>As for the Sermon herewith publiſhed, the Author deſires to be, and to appear cloathed with Humility and Modeſty; and therefore to predicate any thing more of him would be an Injury. Only 'tis a duty to give unto God that Glory of his Grace through which his Servant hath obtained praiſe in the Goſpel, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Churches.

Government and Power of man over man, is indubitably the Appointment and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God. The Moſt High, who has Eſtabliſht his Throne in the Heavens and whoſe Kingdom Ruleth over all Creatures, both in Heaven and in Earth; although he be under no neceſſity of nature, or defect of Power (as Earthly Princes are, who cannot do all alone, but are under a neceſſity to execute by inferiour hands) yet has he been pleaſed (from the good pleaſure of his will, the ſuperabundance of his Goodneſs, and in favour and compaſſion to the Children of men) to make uſe of Inſtruments, and to exert and put forth his power by men, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sword into the Hands of Creatures of our own kind and likeneſs. And indeed ſuch is the immenſity of his Perfections, that our frailty cannot bear his immediate converſes; If God ſhould ſpeak to us, and judge us (as when he promulgated the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>) in an immediate way, his appearance would certainly be aſtoniſhing, the Judgment would be moſt dreadful and terrible. (There being no man can ſee him and live) He has therefore, in his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant goodneſs, as well as infinite wiſdom, appointed men (who are of our own make, and ſubject to the like paſſions and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with our ſelves) to be our Rulers, that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000968_0013_0FAE39A06B86E608"/>
ſo there might be a greater tryal of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Subjection in thoſe who are to obey and be ſubject, and a greater ground of tenderneſs and compaſſion in thoſe who are to Rule and Govern. In this way of Government which God has been pleaſed to ordain (and which is ſo convenient and adapted to our preſent condition and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances) it muſt be acknowledged that the perſons whom he either appoints or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to execute the Office, are not all alike Qualified to promove and advance (which is the common end of Government) the publick Weal. Among thoſe who (in the Providence of God) are veſted with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of this kind, ſome are not ſo capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to hold the Reins of Civil Government for the publick advantage; we read of Childrens being Princes, and of Babes bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rule; and, <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

till they ſigh by reaſon of the bondage; and their cry comes up unto God by reaſon of the bondage. But others there are, who are veſted with this kind of Authority, who look upon themſelves ſet in high Station, not ſo much for themſelves, as for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſake; and accordingly are men ſeeking the Welfare of <hi>Gods Iſrael</hi>; They ſeem to be the accompliſhment of the Lords pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to his people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.23. <hi>Kings ſhall be their Nurſing Fathers, and Queens their Nurſing Mothers.</hi> Such is the ſincere affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and tender regard which they carry to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe whom they have the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of, that they are as careful in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for them, in protecting and defending of them, in dealing compaſſionately &amp; ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly with them, and in extending comforts and conſolations to them, as Nurſes are with reſpect to their Children. It is ſometimes ſuch a ſmile of Divine Favour to a people, as that thoſe who are in place of Civil Rule, and have the Government of them, are ſo wiſe and prudent in their whole deportment, ſo juſt and righteous in all their Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, as is to univerſal ſatisfaction: They are ſo renown'd and famous both for abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and integrity, that whatſoever they do (as it is ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.36.) <hi>pleaſes all the people</hi>; and a ſpecimen we have of

this in the Perſon whom we have giving an account and pourtrait of himſelf as a chief Magiſtrate or Judge, in the Chapter before us.</p>
            <p>At the ſeventh verſe of this Chapter, we have <hi>Job</hi> beginning to ſpeak of himſelf as a Perſon veſted with great Power &amp; Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He had before ſpoken, how it had been with him in his private capacity, as a man, and Maſter of a Family; He there deſcends to ſet forth how it had been with him in his publick capacity as a Magiſtrate, and Ruler of the people. In this Station and Capacity which he ſuſtained, he was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected and applauded: Reſpect and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was paid him, not only from a few, or from thoſe only of Inferiour Quality, but univerſally from perſons of all Ranks &amp; Orders. When he went from his Dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the Streets to the place of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, he was obſerv'd and reverenc'd both by old and young; and when he came to ſit in Judgment, he was eyed and honoured not only by the Body of the people colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, but even by thoſe that were chief and higheſt in Eſteem and Dignity. Such was the reſpect and honour that was paid him, and this not meerly becauſe of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer &amp; Greatneſs, becauſe he was the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all the men in the <hi>East, Chap.</hi> 1.3.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000968_0016_0FAE39A2A9F92DA0"/>
Nor was it from any flattering and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical Courtſhip uſed by him, as <hi>Abſalom</hi> once by his plauſible and fawning carriage, ſtole the hearts of the men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.6. Nor was it becauſe he prevaricated in his Office, as if he ſeem'd to bear the Sword in vain, to hold it only as a Scepter of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament for himſelf, and improved it not as a Sword to be a Revenger, and to Execute wrath upon them that did Evil (a thing moſt pleaſing to thoſe who walk after the Luſts of Ungodlineſs) but it was becauſe of his pity to the Afflicted, <hi>the poor that cried, and the fatherleſs, and him that had none to help him</hi>: It was becauſe he lookt upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf highly concerned in matters of Juſtice: <hi>He put on Righteouſneſs and it cloathed him, his Judgment was as a Robe and a Diadem</hi>: And becauſe he was Impartial in puniſhing the Wicked and Injurious; <hi>He brake the jaws of the wicked, and pluckt the ſpoil out of his teeth:</hi> I ſay ſuch was the reſpect and honour that was paid him by all, together with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of his own univerſal Integrity, that he was ready to conclude and perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this his proſperity, that he ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be moved, that God by his favour had made his <hi>Mountain to ſtand ſo ſtrong,</hi> as that he ſhould multiply his days to a <hi>Good Old Age,</hi> and then come to his <hi>Grave in peace,</hi> leaving

the precious perfume of a Good name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, and a plentiful Inheritance to his Off-ſpring; and to make it apparent, that this was no vain imagination, or unground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed preſumption, he proceeds to propound and illuſtrate his reaſons for this his perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and confidence. I ſhall not ſtand to enumerate and make any reflections upon the ſeveral things which he inſtances in (in the latter part of the Chapter) &amp; by which he argues the reaſonableneſs of his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (in former times) that his flouriſhing ſtate ſhould not wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>I choſe out their way, and ſat chief, &amp; dwelt as a King in the Army, as one that comforteth the Mourners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the words themſelves we may take notice of two things.</p>
            <p>1. A Copy or Tranſcript of <hi>Jobs</hi> Power and Authority; and in this there are two things obſervable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:000968_0018_0FAE39A46AD3E9B8"/>
1. The degree of it. <hi>I ſat Chief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Illuſtration of this by the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a King in the Army: <hi>I ſat Chief, and dwelt as a King in the Army.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Here is an account or relation how he acted in this Capacity or Station; and here are two things which he aſſerts concerning himſelf.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>He choſe out their way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>He was as one that comforteth the Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The terms are very obvious, too plain to call for any laborious Explication, I ſhall therefore give but a brief paraphraſe upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Sat Chief</hi>] The Original Word rendred <hi>Chief,</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Head</hi>: He was the Head or Chief Ruler of the People. It ſeems to Intimate as if he had the Supream Power and Authority: as one ſuſtaining ſuch a Place, <hi>he</hi> Sat while others Stood waiting for his Counſel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And dwelt as a King in the Army</hi>] Some there are who run his Authority ſo high as to place him upon the Throne, affirming that he was a King: Several Expoſitors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for this; I don't ſee that the word of Similitude here <hi>as a King</hi> does affirm that he was a King, as it does not deny that he was a King, but that he was a Magiſtrate, a
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000968_0019_0FAE39A4E0967BC8"/>
Perſon in great Authority, a Chief in his Country, is moſt clear from the account which he here gives of himſelf. <hi>He dwelt as a King in the Army.</hi> As the preſence of a King with the Army does animate, and put courage and chearfulneſs into the whole Army, ſo acceptable was his preſence to his People. As a King is had in great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour when he is among, or with his Army, ſo was he in as much honour among his people: But this is not that which I princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally deſign, and therefore ſhall not dwell upon it any longer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I choſe out their way</hi>] The word in the Original tranſlated <hi>Choſe,</hi> has ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sence and Emphaſis: It imports not only a Chuſing, but a very careful &amp; diligent Chuſing: a Chuſing upon good tryal and proof, and it may hold forth thus much, as if he ſhould have ſaid, in all their doubtful and difficult buſineſs they had recourſe to me for advice; in all their perplex, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous, knotty, and moſt intricate caſes, to me they made application for counſel; I was as it were the Law, or an Oracle to them, and I carefully and diligently chalkt out their way, I made their path plain, ſhewed them what courſe they were to Steer, what methods they were to attend, in order to their coming to the accompliſhment of their deſires.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:000968_0020_0FAE39A84FFACE18"/>
               <hi>As one that comforteth the mourners</hi>] I was notwithſtanding the comforter of the mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: ſo the vulgar tranſlation reads it. <hi>q. d.</hi> Though I ſat chief and dwelt as a King in the Army, yet I, was alſo as one that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth the mourners. Some indeed do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain theſe words, <hi>as one that comforteth the mourners,</hi> to the clauſe immediately preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I dwelt as a King in the Army as one that comforteth the mourners.</hi> As a King or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in the Army does by his preſence and ſpeech, comfort and encourage his Army, mourning and dejected by reaſon of ſome danger that they are in, or loſs which they have ſuſtained: So <hi>Job</hi> is apprehended to have dwelt among his People, as a King comforting his mourning Army But let us take it which way we will (as is obſerved by thoſe who beſt comment upon the place.) It preſents us with a moſt excellent Pattern of a wiſe and gracious Ruler, who is ready to ſympathize and take part with his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to uphold and comfort their Spirits in their moſt calamitous condition: And moſt clearly may be inferred, moſt plainly may be read the happy condition of that people who have ſuch to be their Heads or Rulers, who will do thus: What can a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple deſire more in thoſe that have the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of them, then that they ſhould be
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000968_0021_0FAE39A9BAE9B5F8"/>
men of ſuch wiſdom, as to be able to chuſe out their way, and yet men of ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion as to be moſt willing to comfort them in, and rid them of their troubles?</p>
            <p>The words preſent us with a foundation for a far larger Diſcourſe than the limits aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned at this time can contain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contract my ſelf into as narrow a circle as may be, and take notice of theſe two (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the many) <hi>Propoſitions</hi> or <hi>Doctrinal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions</hi> which might be raiſed from the words.</p>
            <p>
               <label>DOCTRINE I.</label>
That it is a neceſſary Qualification in thoſe who are Heads or Rulers of a People; that they be able to Chuſe out the Peoples way.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, Piety and the Fear of God is the prime and principal Qualification in thoſe who Sit Chief in Place of Authority: If thoſe who are to Govern Gods People have not given up themſelves to be Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, they are not like to Govern for him: If they have not devoted themſelves to God, they are not like to devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Publick Good. We have it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laid down as a principal Character of a Head or Ruler, in that excellent advice of <hi>Jethro</hi> to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 18.21. <hi>That they be ſuch
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000968_0022_0FAE39AADB741F38"/>
as fear God</hi>; but yet certain it is, that the fear of God is not enough to make a perſon in that Station ſufficiently ſerviceable unto man. Every Pious Man is not fit and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to be a Ruler. Such muſt be <hi>able men,</hi> as well as <hi>men fearing God.</hi> That which is ſaid concerning <hi>David</hi> when God Choſe him, and Set him over <hi>Jacob</hi> his People, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> his Inheritance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. <hi>ult. That he guided them by the skilfulneſs of his hands,</hi> is a moſt neceſſary thing in thoſe who are Heads or Rulers of a people, they ſhould be able to guide them by the skilfulneſs of their hands. They ſhould be men of ſingular wiſdom and prudence for the managing of Publick Affairs. <hi>Moſes</hi> preſcribes this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and prudence as a very neceſſary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, when he was giving direction to the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the choiſe of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, <hi>Deut</hi> 1.13. <hi>Take ye wiſe men and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> (Perſons of knowledge, wiſdom, and experience) <hi>and I will make them Rulers over you</hi>; and this was that which <hi>Solomon</hi> was ſo deſirous of, and which he obtained. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Wiſdom and Knowledge to go out and to come in before the People. i. e.</hi> That he might be able wiſely to conduct them in all their Affairs. And how requiſite this is in thoſe who are Heads or Rulers of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, will be ſufficiently apparent if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe two or three things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:000968_0023_0FAE39AB162FFA38"/>1. <hi>Thoſe who are Heads or Rulers of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, have a very great Truſt repoſed in them.</hi> This is moſt clear, if we conſider the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they bear to their People: the Heads or Rulers of a People are the Fathers of the People; Kings are called <hi>Fathers, Iſa.</hi> 49 23. And Magiſtrates ſuſtain the Relation of a Father to their faithful People: <hi>Job</hi> in his Civil capacity ſpeaks of himſelf as being a Father to the poor, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16 <hi>context.</hi> And as careful and provident are thoſe in Authority to be for their people, as if their people were their Children; and this is a very great charge and requires a great deal of Wiſdom and Prudence to manage it. A great deal of Wiſdom and Prudence is requiſite in the father of a Family for the right diſcharge of his truſt in that Relation, and if ſo much be requiſite in an Aeconomical father, the father of a Family, how much more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in a Political father, the father of a Country? When the Apoſtles found it neceſſary to appoint Inferiour Officers in the Church for the caſing themſelves of their care and burden in ſerving Tables, and making proviſion for the Poor, they give this in charge, <hi>Act.</hi> 6 3. <hi>Brethren, look you out among you men of honeſt report, full of the holy Ghoſt and</hi> Wiſdom: and if perſons are not fit to manage ſo inferiour a Service as

the buſineſs of the Poor, unleſs they are full of the holy Ghoſt and Wiſdom, how requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite is it for thoſe who have the charge of a People, that they be like the men of <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> of whom its ſaid, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.32. <hi>That they were men that had underſtanding of the times, to know what Iſrael ought to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Thoſe who are Heads or Rulers of a People, have many curious and critical obſervers, and are obnoxious to a great deal of cenſure. A city that is ſet on a hill cannot be hid, Math.</hi> 5.14. It is obvious to every eye. As long as a man lives in a private capacity he ſtands as it were in the croud, but when once he comes to ſuſtain a Publick, he is erected upon the Stage, and the eyes of all the People are upon him, as they were upon <hi>Saul,</hi> who was higher than any of the People, from his Shoulders &amp; upward. The leaſt aberration in them is preſently beheld, as the leaſt Eclipſe in the Heavenly bodies is inſtantly obſerv'd and taken notice of. A little folly is very prejudicial and injurious to him that is in reputation for wiſdom and honour, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.1. Yea, and how frequent is it for ſome to ſeek advantages againſt ſuch? to watch for their halting? And hence, if any evil befall the Publick, how apt are they to charge it upon thoſe who are their Heads or Rulers? When a people are in any conſiderable
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000968_0025_0FAE39AC694D8C20"/>
diſtreſs, what is more common than to throw the firſt ſtone of complaint at thoſe who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> over them in Authority? When we proſper never ſo much, we are wont to applaud only our ſelves; when we ſuffer never ſo little we are too apt to murmur only againſt our Rulers: need have ſuch therefore to have their eyes in their heads, and to be much in making the Prayer of the Pſalmiſt; <hi>Teach me thy way O Lord, and lead me in a plain path, becauſe of mine enemies, Pſal.</hi> 27.11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>When thoſe who are Heads or Rulers of a People, are not able (in ſome meaſure) to chooſe out their way, it will be difficult and next to an impoſſibility to maintain the honour and dignity of Government, which is a matter of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</hi> An ability for this commands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and honour: <hi>a mans wiſdom</hi> (and eſpecially a Rulers) <hi>makes his face to ſhine, Eccl.</hi> 8.1. There is ſcarce any thing that do's more affect the hearts of a People, than to ſee a Divine Spirit in thoſe that are over them: <hi>Solomons</hi> wiſdom made him more glorious &amp; ſought to than his wealth; when in one ſpecial inſtance he gave proof of his ability, the <hi>Text</hi> ſayes, <hi>That all Iſrael heard of the judgment that the King had judged, and they feared the King, for they ſaw that the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God was in him to do judgment,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.28. But when ſuch as are Heads or Rulers
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000968_0026_0FAE39AD252B7508"/>
of a People, are deſtitute of thoſe endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; qualifications which are neceſſary for the executing of their Places, they will be deſtitute of that reſpect and honour which otherwiſe would have been attributed and given to them in ſuch places. If folly be ſet in great dignity, men will be ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe that dominion, to ſpeak evil of that dignity. When the wiſe are in low place, it is as when a goodly Candle (which on a Table would give a comely &amp; comfortable light) is put under a Buſhel: and when ſuch as are otherwiſe, are exalted; it is (as one expreſſes it) like a little Hay ſet up to give light, which with its ſmoak and ſmell is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to all that are about it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>For thoſe who are Heads or Rulers of a People, to be able to chooſe out the Peoples way is a matter of ſuch moment, that when they are uncapable of this, it is very fatal and ruinous to a People.</hi> As the want of this is diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in thoſe that Govern, ſo it is very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to thoſe who are to be Governed. When thoſe that ſhould lead a People are not able to chooſe out their way, inſtead of ſhewing them the right way, they will lead them out of the right way. Thus we read, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.12. <hi>As for my people, Children are their op<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſſours, and women rule over them</hi> (weak and effeminate are they that govern them) and

what follows? <hi>O my people they which lead thee, cauſe thee to err, and deſtroy the way of thy paths</hi>: and this is fatal and ruinous, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.16. <hi>The leaders of this people cauſe them to err, and they that are lead of them are deſtroyed.</hi> When thoſe that ſhould chooſe out their way lead them quite out of the way, whither will that way lead, but to deſtruction? <hi>If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the Ditch, Mat.</hi> 15.14</p>
            <p>But I might loſe my ſelf in multiplying particulars here, for the evincing the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a peoples having ſuch for their Heads or Rulers as are able to chuſe out their way, I have mentioned but a very few of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which I might have named, and poſſibly many others far more pregnant and pertinent, may offer themſelves to your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations: we muſt paſs to the ſecond <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propoſition,</hi> or <hi>Doctrinal Concluſion,</hi> viz.</p>

            <p>It is requiſite that ſuch as are Heads or Rulers of a People (as we have ſaid) be able to chuſe out the peoples way, this is
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000968_0028_0FAE39AEEBE34678"/>
neceſſary in order to their making their people happy, but this in it ſelf is not enough to make their people happy. However, thoſe who are Heads or Rulers of a People may be able to lead &amp; direct their people; yet if they are not diſpoſed to ſeek the comfort and proſperity of their people, ſuch a people may be miſerable notwithſtanding ſuch Heads or Rulers. But on the other hand, when thoſe that are in high Station, &amp; have the Government of a people, are <hi>thus</hi> able to Chuſe out their <hi>way,</hi> and likewiſe ready to promote their comfort and weal, it is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular happineſs to ſuch a people.</p>
            <p>I ſhall mention but a very few things for the Illuſtration (&amp; to make out the truth) of this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That for which God hath appointed and ſet up Civil Government in the world, is the common good of Mankind.</hi> It is remarkable that the Scripture applieth the ſame Title to thoſe that Preach the Word, and to thoſe that bear the Sword; they are both of them called Gods Miniſters; and as they have the ſame Title, ſo they have the ſame common end: as they are both Gods Miniſters, ſo there is the ſame common end of their Miniſtry, &amp; that is the good &amp; welfare of the Children of men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4 <hi>He is the Miniſter of God unto thee for Good,</hi> ſpeaking of the Civil Ruler, or Magiſtrate; <hi>q. d.</hi> that's the end of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000968_0029_0FAE39AF95D752E8"/>
for this reaſon hath God veſted him with his Autho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thoſe in Authority are Rulers over the perſons of the People; but yet they are appointed and ſet up by God to be Miniſters or Servants to the good of the People. As it is the Duty of all to ſerve them, ſo it is their Office to ſerve all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence thoſe that are Heads or Rulers of a People ought to deſign and endeavour the good and comfort of their People.</hi> This is written with a beam of the Sun: as God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſome to the Dignity of Headſhip, or to bear Rule for the Good of his People: So it is the Duty of thoſe who are Heads or Rulers, to promote and further this. The end of every thing ſhould direct the means; now that of Government being the Good of the whole, nothing leſs ſhould be the aim and endeavour of thoſe who are Governours; the Adminiſtration of their Power ſhould be attended with the exerciſe of their Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: they are called <hi>Gods, Pſal.</hi> 82.6 And in this in an eſpecial manner they ſhould imitate God, <hi>viz</hi> their mercy ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all their works; as the <hi>Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious,</hi> was the firſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Name, whereby God proclaimed himſelf of old, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. So in this is He in an eſpecial manner to be imitated by thoſe who are called by his name. Thoſe

that are Heads or Rulers of a People ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uld deſign the love and affection of their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as well as the obedience and ſubjection of their people. He ſpake no ways becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Head or Ruler of a People, who ſaid of his Subjects, <hi>Oderint dum probent,</hi> Let them hate me ſo long as they ſuffer my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings to paſs. That was more becoming the Head or Ruler of a People which <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crobius</hi> Relates of <hi>Octavius Auguſtus, viz.</hi> that he carried ſuch an entire and fatherly affection to the Common Wealth, that he called it <hi>filiam ſuam,</hi> his own Daughter; and therefore refuſed to be called <hi>Dominus,</hi> the Lord or Maſter of his Country, and would only be called <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Country, becauſe he Governed it <hi>non per timorem, ſed per amorem,</hi> not by fear but by love: or as it is ſaid of that Mirrour of men among the Heathen <hi>Nemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem a ſe dimiſic triſtem,</hi> he never diſmiſſed any Petitioner with a tear in his eye, or with a heavy heart. 'Tis true, there is ſometimes a neceſſity of uſing Severity, but it ſhould be the choiſe and delight of thoſe in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to exerciſe Clemency. Tho' there are caſes wherein ſeverity ought to caſt the ſcale, yet the Sword of Juſtice (as one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it) ſhould be furbiſhed with the oyl of mercy; Rulers <hi>are to be a terror to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:000968_0031_0FAE39B68DF1AFD8"/>
evil works, Rom.</hi> 13.3. <hi>to puniſh Evil doers,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. But it is the beſt and moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable part of their work to comfort the mourners.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>For a people to have Heads or Rulers, is in in it ſelf accounted a great and neceſſary bleſſing to them.</hi> It is a Bleſſing to the complex body of a people in general, and alſo to every private man in particular; and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable are the inconveniences and miſeries which will inevitably enſue upon the want of ſuch. It is propheſied of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their deſolate eſtate, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.4. <hi>That they ſhould abide many days without a King, and without a Prince</hi>; the word that is there tranſlated <hi>Prince,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth a <hi>Governour</hi> or <hi>Ruler</hi>; and truly it is a ſad condition that a people is in, when they are without any Governours or Rulers. Even bad Government is acknowledged bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than none at all: who is there but will grant that Tyranny (except it grow to a great extremity indeed) is better than A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy? Through this our very lives are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in ſafety: and without this the world would <hi>Ipſo facto,</hi> be in a ſtate of War, and fall into endleſs diſorders. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was but a bad man, an evil Prince, and yet the Prophet gives him this honourable Title, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4 20. <hi>The breath of our noſtrils, i. e.</hi> our life; and certain it is that a man may as ſoon live
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000968_0032_0FAE39B6E764C720"/>
without breath, as a people or common-wealth ſubſiſt without Government. Thoſe in Authority are called <hi>Pillars of the earth,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.8. And certain it is that the world would ſoon run into confuſion (and upon ſome accounts) ſhatter to pieces, if the Lord had not founded it upon pillars of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ſet up Governours as the pillars of it. How vile would multitudes be who have not the fear of <hi>God,</hi> were they not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained and kept back by the Laws of <hi>men?</hi> It was for want of Government among the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that things went ſo ill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that every man did <hi>that which was right in his own eyes,</hi> and to what an height of Impiety they arrived when they were thus deſtitute of perſons in Authority, we may Read in the Story of the <hi>Levites</hi> Concubine.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Sometimes God gives ſuch to a People to be their Heads or Rulers, who are able to chuſe out their way, and will alſo be a Comfort to them.</hi> Such a Head or Ruler was <hi>Moſes</hi>; how did he chuſe out the peoples way? and how ſollicitous was he of their comfort when he wiſht, if it were poſſible, that God would accept of him as a ſacrifice in their ſtead, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.32. What deſtruction had come upon them, had not <hi>Moſes</hi> by his prevailing interceſſion prevented? therefore he ſaid,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:000968_0033_0FAE39B7A6E8BD38"/>
               <hi>that he would deſtroy them, had not Moſes his Choſen ſtood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath, leſt he ſhould deſtroy them, Pſal.</hi> 106.23. Such a Head or Ruler was <hi>Joſhua,</hi> a man <hi>in whom was the ſpirit,</hi> Numb. 27.18. <hi>Full of the ſpirit of wiſdom, Deut.</hi> 34 9. And he faithfully endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Good of that People. Such a Head or Ruler was <hi>David</hi> over Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Iſrael</hi>; as he guided them by the <hi>skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his hands, ſo he fed them according to the integrity of his heart, Pſal.</hi> 78. <hi>ult.</hi> Sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſought the comfort and welfare of his People; and ſuch an one was <hi>Solomon,</hi> to whom God gave ſuch a wiſe and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding heart, that no meer man ſince the Fall ever equalled him in univerſal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and eſpecially the art of well Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his people, and it was for their good and comfort as well as his own, that he was ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Happineſs to them.</hi> It is a great and neceſſary Bleſſing (as we have ſaid already) for a People to have Heads or Rulers, and if ſo, much more is it a great and neceſſary Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to have ſuch Heads or Rulers as theſe. God promiſes ſuch Heads or Rulers as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular happineſs to his People: when they were pining and languiſhing under a very uncomfortable Government, God ſupports them with this bleſſed promiſe, <hi>I will restore thy Judges as at the firſt, and thy Counſellors as at the beginning, Iſa.</hi> 1.26. <hi>i. e.</hi> I will give thee ſuch Heads or Rulers as thou hadſt at the beginning, either of thy Common-Wealth, ſuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> or of thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſuch as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſuch Heads or Rulers are ſaid to be given in great mercy to a People; <hi>Becauſe the Lord loved Iſrael, therefore made He thee King, to do Judgment and Juſtice,</hi> was it ſaid of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10.9. Yea and ſuch Heads or Rulers as are couragious and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in promoting the comfort of their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, have the promiſe of Gods protection &amp; bleſſing in their promoting the ſame, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 19. <hi>ult.</hi> and conſidering of this, we may ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal</hi> 144. <hi>ult.

                  <hi>Hence we are informed, What cauſe of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs the People have who enjoy ſuch Heads or Rulers as theſe</hi> The Bleſſings of God call for thankfulneſs; Such Heads or Rulers as we have been ſpeaking of, being ſuch a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular bleſſing, the People that enjoy them, ought to be very thankful to God for them. When ſuch as are Heads or Rulers of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are otherwiſe, are contrary to theſe, it is matter of mourning: The Prophet was greatly affected and troubled upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thoſe Rulers who ſought themſelves only, and not the good of the Publick, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Thy Princes are Rebellious, and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Thieves, every one loveth Gifts, and followeth after Rewards, they judge not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, neither doth the cauſe of the Widow come unto them.</hi> So when the Princes of that People, inſtead of being Examples of Piety and Vertue, and promoters of the Publick Weal were Patrons and Actors of wickedneſs, <hi>Ezek</hi> 11.1, 2. The Spirit of God ſeems to be affected with it, and affects the Prophet with it. Well, but when ſuch
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:000968_0036_0FAE39BA472BC8F0"/>
are Heads or Rulers of a People, as we have been deſcribing, it is matter of joy, and we ought to thank our God always upon the account of ſuch. It is ſpoken with reſpect to <hi>Solomon,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord thy God, which delighted in thee to ſet thee on his Throne, to be King for the Lord thy God.</hi> God deſerves all Bleſſing and Praiſe when he advances ſuch to be Kings, or Governours, or Inferiour Rulers of his People.</p>

                  <hi>Hence it is a Judgment upon a People, and a matter of deep Lamentation to them, when God is removing and taking away ſuch Heads or Rulers from them.</hi> God threatens this as a ſore Judgment upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Judah, Iſa</hi> 3 1, 2. <hi>That he would take away from them the Judge; the Civil Magiſtrate.</hi> And when God frowns thus upon a People, they ought to lie in the Duſt.

Give me leave to ſay, that it is highly honourable, <hi>it deſerves Honour.</hi> Some of the worſt of Rulers have had high Encomiums and Praiſes, but good Rulers deſerve high Encomiums &amp; Praiſes; it is a truth with reſpect to thoſe in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy as well as thoſe in the Miniſtry, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Let the Elders that Rule well be accounted worthy of double honour. And as it deſerves honour, ſo it is the way to have honour.</hi> I know ſome will never be ſatisfyed, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be murmuring, let thoſe that are over them do what they can; but yet ſuch Rulers as are a comfort to their People, are in the faireſt way to hear well from their People; and God who has the hearts of all men in his hands, is wont to give unto ſuch Heads and Rulers a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And alſo let me add this, that it will be comfortable both in life &amp; at Death. When a man as a Head or Ruler of his People, has choſe out their way and endeavoured their comfort and proſperity, then may he well deſire of God with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.5, 6. <hi>Remember me O Lord with the favour that thou beareſt to thy People, that I may ſee the good of thy choſen, that I may rejoyce in the gladneſs of thy Nation, that I may glory with thine Inheritance.</hi> And as <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> after all his great undertakings for the Publick Weal, <hi>Think upon me my God for good, according to all that I have done for this people, Neh.</hi> 5.19.</p>
