         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Sin of <hi>ONAN,</hi> and GOD's ſudden Vengeance upon it, are ſo remarkable, that every Body will eaſily perceive, that from his Name I have d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>riv'd the running Title of this little Book; and tho' I treat of this Crime in Relation to <hi>Women,</hi> as well as <hi>Men,</hi> whilſt the Offence, is <hi>SELF-POLLUTION</hi> in both, I could not think of any other Word which would ſo well put the Reader in Mind both of the <hi>Sin</hi> and its <hi>Puniſhment</hi> at once, as this.</p>
            <p>THIS Practice is ſo frequent, and ſo crying an Offence, eſpecially among the MALE YOUTH of this Nation, that I have Reaſon to imagine, a great many Offenders would never have been Guilty of it, if they had been thoroughly acquainted with the Heinouſneſs of the Crime, and the ſad Conſequences to the BODY as well as the SOUL, which may, and often do enſue upon it. This was the chief Motive that induc'd me to write on this Subject.</p>
            <p>THOSE who are of Opinion, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Frequency of this Sin, it never ought to be ſpoke of, or hinted at, becauſe the bare mentioning of it may be dangerous to ſome, who without it, would never have thought of it, I hope will find themſelves fully Anſwer'd.</p>

               <pb n="ii" facs="unknown:002573_0004_0FDB15D5FB7688C0"/>AND as I am fully perſwaded, that there are very few Sentences throughout the BOOK, which do not more or leſs tend to the Mortification of Luſt, and not one that can give Offence to the chaſteſt Ear, ſo I dare recommend the ſerious Peruſal of it to both Sexes: And that it has been look'd upon as Inſtructive, without being hurtful, (by others as well as my ſelf,) will appear from the following LETTER ſent me by a very Learned and Pious Divine.</p>

They ſtudy Caſes of Conſcience</hi> (as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds) <hi>in the Caſe of carnal Sins, not to avoid, but to learn Ways how to offend God, and pollute their own Spirits, and ſearch their Houſes with a Sun-Beam, that they may be instructed in all the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Nastineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am perſwaded, that thoſe who have defil'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by this Practice already, or elſe by wicked Thoughts are tempted ſo to do, muſt underſtand what I mean by SELF-POLLUTION, as I have defin'd it, without any farther Interpretation. To them it is that I chiefly recommend theſe Pages, with my hearty Deſire of their moſt ſerious Conſideration on what is contain'd in them: And as to ſuch who never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted this Guilt, and being perhaps of ſmall Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience may be wholly ignorant of the Sin I would warn them againſt, I think them happy in their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; aſſuring them withal, that they ſhall meet here with nothing but what ſhall more and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them to Chaſtity, and deter them from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Uncleanneſs.</p>
            <p>SELF-POLLUTION we ſee remarkably puniſh'd in <hi>Onan,</hi> by a particular Stroke from Almighty God, for it is not to be thought that his Guilt lay totally in
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002573_0009_0FDB1622CF073E88"/>
not raiſing up Seed to his Deceaſed Brother <hi>Er,</hi> tho' we'll own that this was an aggravation of it, but the Way he took to prevent it would have been highly culpable at any other Time; and from the Words of the Text, which informs us of this Part of Sacred Hiſtory, it is reaſonable to imagine, that the greateſt Part of the Offence lay in the act of defiling himſelf, rather than in the Neglect of his Duty; <hi>the thing which he</hi> Did <hi>diſpleaſed the Lord, wherefore he ſlew him alſo,</hi> Gen. 38. ver. 10. It was therefore the thing he <hi>Did,</hi> rather than the thing he omitted, which moſt diſpleas'd the Lord, as may be further ſeen in, <hi>Deut.</hi> Chap. 25. from ver. 5, <hi>to</hi> 10. Be that as it will, this is certain, that as it was, it prov'd ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable a Provocation, that Almighty God could not bear with it, and therefore immediately cut him off by Reaſon of it.</p>
            <p>SOME eaſy Caſuiſts notwithſtanding the Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Puniſhment that has attended this Sin, have made ſlight of it, and ſhamefully deceiv'd thoſe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted them, ſeveral of them perhaps to their Ruin. Others, by being too open though ſevere enough, have treated this matter ſo groſly in the learned Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, that it is impoſſible to tranſlate any part of them, wihout offending Chaſtity.</p>
            <p>THE Learned <hi>Oſtervald,</hi> in his uſeful Treatiſe on Uncleanneſs in all its Branches, has through an exceſs of Modeſty, paſs'd over this abominable Sort of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity in Silence, or at leaſt ſpoke of it in ſuch gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Terms, blending it with leſſer Treſpaſſes of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, that he has fail'd of Repreſenting the Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs that is in it. Having hinted at the Sins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and ſpoke at large of <hi>Adultery</hi> and <hi>Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> he adds, <hi>That, beſides thoſe, there are many Actions contrary to Modeſty and Chastity, ſome
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002573_0010_0FDB15EEAACF1B40"/>
whereof,</hi> ſays he, <hi>by the Violence of the Paſſion, and full Conſent of the Will, or by Reaſon of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity and Infamy of the Action, almost equal the Crime to which th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>haſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are hurried by their Luſt, to try in every thing to gratify their Brutal Paſſion, as far as they can conceive to do it, without committing the Fact. But here,</hi> continues he, <hi>I must be very wary, and leave to my Readers, the Trouble of conſidering with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, what I may not ſay, and apply to all the Actions of Impurity, what I may but juſt touch upon very briefly, and only in general Terms</hi> — And lower he ſays, <hi>Now foraſmuch as I cannot well repeat all thoſe Actions which are hurtful to Purity, and yet my Readers may be doubtful of ſome of them, and may queſtion whether this or that be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, I ſhall lay down this one general Rule in this Place, whereby theſe Doubts may be eaſily reſolv'd. Let Natural Chaſtity and Modeſty be first conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; becauſe, provided a Habit of Wickedneſs has not quite extinguiſh'd in us the ſenſe of Modesty, which is natural to us as Men, we ſhall readily diſcern whether an Action be unchaste or no. Next; this principle is to be attended to, that a Chriſtian is bound to ſhun whatever ſenſualizes the Soul, whatever tends only to ſatisfie the Paſſions, and whatever is wont to excite them in us, or other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>AND again, Enquiry ſhould be made what is neceſſary, or at leaſt, what is expreſly allowed. I ſay then, that whenſoever we are aſham'd of what we do, and dare not venture upon it in the ſight of others, when it is only the Effect of a diſorderly Paſſion, and aims only at indulging Senſuality, and kindling impure Deſires, either in our own, or others Hearts; and when moreover it is neither ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary nor expreſly allow'd, we ſhould be ſure to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from it.</hi>—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:002573_0011_0FDB1627CA412328"/>THIS is admirable Advice, and excludes not the leaſt Act of Impurity; but there is wanting that Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, with which the Reader ought to be fill'd againſt SELF POLLUTION, above other Acts of Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs leſs criminal. But that this Author only forbore to pronounce his juſt Cenſure againſt this ſort of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity in particular, for no other Reaſon than his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too ſcrupulouſly modeſt, is manifeſt from his own Confeſſion, that he was forc'd to be defective in many particulars. <hi>Some Points,</hi> ſays he, in his Preface, <hi>ſhould have been more enlarg'd upon; and ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections more particularly conſider'd; but this would have neceſſitated me to touch up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n ſome Things, which Decency forbids. There are alſo divers Things, which I am obliged to expreſs only in general Terms; others which I dare but juſt hint; and others again that I am forc'd totally to ſuppreſs.</hi>—</p>
            <p>THERE have been other Caſuiſts again, who treating of this Subject, have been neither too plain, nor too remiſs, but by too much Subtilty ſtrain'd their Arguments beyond their natural Force, and done an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to Truth and good Senſe, by being too Sophiſtical. One of theſe having premiſed, that Luſts of Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are committed firſt with ones ſelf: Secondly with others, expreſſes himſelf in the manner following: <hi>First,</hi> ſays he, <hi>we will begin with thoſe committed with ones ſelf, which are greater in themſelves (ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract them from all other Circumſtances) than with any other, as Self-Murder is worſe than the Murder of any other; ſo in and of it ſelf, this is worſe than polluting of another. For the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ule is, that the Sin that doth break the Order of Love moſt is the worst, Love being the keeping of the Commandments. I muſt not defile my Neighbour, becauſe I am to love my Neighbour's Chaſtity, but I am to love my ſelf, and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002573_0012_0FDB15F0337854A0"/>
my own Chaſtity, before the Chaſtity of any elſe; and this is a foul Sin, much againſt Nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the worſe; for the more unnatural the Sin is, the greater the Guilt is ſtill in that reſpect; and whereas it is thought, that there is not that wrong in it, as in taking away the Chaſtity of another, I urge it, that there is moſt Wrong when a Man doth Wrong to himſelf; and as the Thief doth in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, ſo theſe Self-Defilements do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot and weaken the Body by the Curſe of God exceedingly. Beſides, (as in all ſuch inordinate Practices) there is a ſecret kind of Murder, what if not in the intention of the Doer, yet in the Condition of the thing done; wherefore God is much diſpleaſed with theſe kind of Sins.</hi>—</p>
            <p>TO all the latter Part of theſe Aſſertions I could readily agree; but in the beginning of them this Caſuiſt hath been groſly overſeen in his way of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. The Difference he ſtates between the Murder of another, and that of ones ſelf, is very juſt; but then he has forgot to conſider, that that difference ceaſes, when the Murder of another neceſſarily includes the Murder of ones ſelf: Thus by endeavouring to prove too much, his Argument has not proved what it might have done. At this rate, SELF-POLLUTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON would be more criminal than the moſt unnatural Abomination with others, which is falſe, becauſe it is impoſſible to defile others without defiling ones ſelf at the ſame time in as high a Degree.</p>
            <p>TO condemn and expoſe a Sin ſo diſpleaſing to God, ſo detrimental to the Publick, and ſo injurious to our ſelves, requires no Flights of Wit, nor any other way of arguing, than what is agreeable to the plaineſt Truth, and can ſtand the Teſt of the ſevereſt Reaſon. To prove the many Injuries it may do to our ſelves, as it is the whole Buſineſs of the next Chapter, ſo I refer
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002573_0013_0FDB1629FB0BFF50"/>
the Reader to it; and that it is very detrimental to the Publick, will ſoon appear, if we conſider what is undeniable, that it hinders Marriage, and puts a full ſtop to Procreation. What remains, is to demonſtrate, that it is diſpleaſing to God; and that it is ſo in a very high Degree, is evident both from the Holy Scripture, and our own Reaſon.</p>
            <p>THERE is not a Place either in the Old or New Teſtament, where Uncleanneſs, the Luſts of the Fleſh, or the Abominations of <hi>Sodom</hi> are condemn'd, but this Sin is hinted at among others; and there is no doubt, but thoſe who are guilty of it, are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended among the Abominable, <hi>who ſhall have their Part in the Lake, which burneth with Fire and Brimstone,</hi> Rev. 21. v. 8. <hi>What! know ye not,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, that your Body is the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, which is in you, which you have of God?</hi> And this is a very powerful Conſideration to diſſwade from Uncleanneſs, being taken from the Glory where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God has rais'd us, even in regard as to our Bodies. They are the Temples of the Holy Spirit, becauſe the Holy Spirit dwells in us, and pours forth his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits upon us, ſanctifies us, and conſecrates us to the Service of God; wherefore our Bodies partaking of this Honour, we are bound to preſerve them in purity, and to employ them to holy Purpoſes; for if the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples dedicated to the Worſhip of God, may not be prophan'd by any POLLUTION, but muſt be kept pure and undefiled, how great ought the Holineſs of our Bodies to be, ſeeing God has condeſcended to make them the Temples of His Holy Spirit? This Reflection of St. <hi>Paul</hi> lets us ſee plainly, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any give themſelves over to Uncleanneſs, they ceaſe to be the Temples of the Holy Spirit, juſt as the Apoſtle had ſaid before, that they ceaſe to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002573_0014_0FDB15F207D32898"/>
be the Members of Jeſus Chriſt, which ſhews this Sin to be the Occaſion that the Holy Spirit of God withdraws from the Hearts of ſuch as are guilty of it, becauſe his Spirit cannot dwell with POLLUTION. He tells us afterwards in the ſame Chapter, <hi>Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a Price, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore glorifie God in your Bodies, and in your Spirits which are God's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſame Apoſtle affirms of the Heathens, <hi>that being given up to Uncleanneſs, they diſhonoured their own Bodies between themſelves.</hi> And in another Place, <hi>that it is the Will of God, that we abſtain from Uncleanneſs.</hi> But it would be endleſs to quote all the Texts, which tend to the ſame Purpoſe. Let any Man examine all the Places of the New Teſtament, where mention is made of Vices and Sins, and he will find, there is not any one other Crime ſo many times named as Uncleanneſs; and how can a Perſon be more ſuperlatively unclean, than when he is guilty of SELF-POLLUTION.</p>
            <p>BUT if it was not reveal'd to us that God is highly offended at all manner of Uncleanneſs; when we reflect on the End of Marriage in all Countries, and in all Societies, and the manner after which God has ordain'd that our Species ſhould be continu'd, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion, and our own Reaſon would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us, that to deſtroy that End, muſt be very offenſive to God, if there is one; for whether we commit Abomination with thoſe of our own Sex, as the Scripture ſays, <hi>Men with Men;</hi> or with Beaſts; or that we defile our own Bodies our ſelves with this ſhameful Action, the Conſequences are the ſame to the Society and our Species; and what a learned Divine has ſaid of the firſt, is equally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002573_0015_0FDB162B0B2B40C0"/>
to all three, <hi>That the Crime in it ſelf is monſtrous and unnatural; in its Practice filthy and odious to Extremity; its Guilt is crying, and its Conſequences ruinous; It deſtroys conjugal Affecti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>FOR <hi>Fornication</hi> and <hi>Adultery</hi> it ſelf, tho' hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Sins, we have Frailty and Nature to plead; but SELF-POLLUTION is a Sin, not only againſt N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but a Sin, that perverts and extinguiſhes Nature, and he who is guilty of it, is la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouring at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his Kind, and in a manner ſtrikes at the Creation it ſelf. That this Sin, and all the Miſchiefs that may attend it, are equally ruinous in either Sex, in regard to the civil Society, as well as themſelves, ſhall be demonſtrated in the following Chapter. In the Remainder of this, I ſhall examine into the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of SELF-POLLUTION, and offer ſome Thoughts to prevent at leaſt the Frequency of it.</p>
            <p>I Shall not here meddle with the Cauſes of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs in general, ſuch as <hi>Ill-Books, Bad Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, Love-Stories, Laſcivious Diſcourſes,</hi> and other Provocatives to <hi>Luſt</hi> and <hi>Wantonneſs;</hi> as theſe are ſufficiently treated of in moſt Books of Devotion and Practical Divinity, ſo I refer the Reader to them, and deſign only to ſpeak of thoſe peculiar Cauſes, which belong to this Sin, and hardly any other.</p>
            <p>THE firſt Cauſe is Ignorance: There are Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands among the Youth of both Sexes <hi>Ingenious, Docile, Diligent,</hi> and <hi>Tractable,</hi> who either by the Example of their Intimates; through their own Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs; or by being idle and alone; and ſome by meer Accident, have learn'd to Pollute themſelves
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002573_0016_0FDB15F5D3070478"/>
after this manner, that would have abhorred the Thoughts, had they underſtood the Nature of the Sin, and been acquainted with the Heinouſneſs of the Crime. There are likewiſe many adult Perſons, both Men and Women, who are guilty of this Sin, and perhaps Reprobates enough to Commit any, as to Religious Fears, that would never have ventur'd upon this, if they had known what Bodily Suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rings and Infirmities it may be, and often is the Occaſion of.</p>
            <p>THE Second, is the Secrecy, with which SELF-POLLUTION may be committed: All other Actions of Uncleanneſs muſt have a Witneſs, this needs none. Some luſtful Women of Senſe, have made all the outward Shew of Virtue and Morality that can be required; they have had Prudence enough, in the midſt of ſtrong Deſires, to refuſe diſadvantageous Matches, and yet have abandon'd themſelves to this Vice, when at the ſame time, they would rather have died, than betray'd a Weakneſs to any Man living, as afterwards becoming Penitents they have confeſs'd themſelves. And again ſome young Men of vicious Inclinations, have either naturally, or for want of a liberal Education, been ſhamefac'd to Exceſs; they have not dar'd to look upon a Woman, and their Baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs has ſecur'd them from every Act of Impurity, but This. From all which, it is evident, that the Secrecy of this Sin has betray'd many into it, whom hardly any thing elſe would have tempted.</p>
            <p>THE third and laſt Cauſe I ſhall alledge, is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity. Tho' the Laws againſt <hi>Fornication</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,</hi> are in many Places either very remiſs, or ill executed, yet the Dread of them keeps the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Awe. The Puniſhment for unnatural Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties committed with others, is Capital. But the Laws
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002573_0017_0FDB1630EC2E5D20"/>
are not the only thing which vicious Perſons are afraid of. Some are with-held from Proſtitutes by their Covetouſneſs only. Others again abſtain from <hi>Fornication</hi> for nothing elſe but the fear of Diſeaſes, or the having of Children. Laſcivious Widows, who underſtand the World, have reaſon to ſcruple ſecond Marriages, on many Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts; ſome love their Liberty; others their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and if they value their Reputation, they'll not dare to venture on unlawful Embraces; whereas in SELF-POLLUTION, neither the cautious, nor the covetous, imagine that they have any thing to fear.</p>
            <p>IT is not eaſy to determine, whether it be more monſtrous or unaccountable, that rather than commit a Sin before others, who would be their Accomplices, and uphold them in it, Men ſhould chuſe to be guilty of a greater before God, who has vow'd to revenge it. To ſay that this proceeds from <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and want of <hi>Faith,</hi> is contrary to Experience, for let us take a thouſand People to task, that ſhall have all been guilty of this or any other the moſt Heinous Crime, and we ſhall hardly find one, but what will not only acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a <hi>Deity,</hi> but likewiſe tell us, that he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of his <hi>Ubiquity</hi> and <hi>Omniſcience,</hi> his <hi>Wiſdom, Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> and that he is ready to ſubſcribe to every Article of Chriſtianity. What can be ſaid of this, is, that Man contradicts himſelf, and acts directly againſt his own Principle. What could be more abſurd in humane Affairs, than that a Thief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to ſteal a Horſe, ſhould endeavour to ſhun the Eyes of all the World but the Owners; eſpecially if he was fully perſwaded, that this Owner could catch him whenever he would, and inſtict what Puniſhment upon him he pleas'd? What Spiritual darkneſs muſt ſurround Man, that ſhould be ſtark blind in his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Concerns, and clear ſighted only in Trifles? When
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002573_0018_0FDB15F7C2501638"/>
a Man ſhews Baſhfulneſs, and the utmoſt Cowardice to the moſt impotent Wretch of his Fellow Creatures, is it not unconceivable he ſhould behave himſelf with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antick Boldneſs and Impudence, to affront the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Creator of Heaven and Earth? Yet there is one thing more contradictory ſtill, which is, that at the ſame time he'll affect to be thought Brave as to Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and a Chriſtian as to Religion.</p>
            <p>IT is the general Opinion, that the Shameleſs are the worſt of People; yet Shame when ill plac'd, has often wrought worſe Effects than the Reverſe alone has ever been able to produce. When a Baſtard Infant is found dead, and the Mother lately deliver'd without Witneſs, is not able to prove either that ſhe had made Proviſion for it, or during her Pregnancy, imparted the Secret to another beſides the Father, our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Law, without any other Evidence, preſumes the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to have Murder'd the Child. From whence it is evident the Legiſlators muſt have ſuppos'd that ſome Women may have Cruelty enough to commit the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unnatural Murder of all, and at the ſame time want Courage to bear Shame: But is there no Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be found againſt this prepoſterous Shame? Is it impoſſible to imbue Youth with better Notions of it than are commonly received either by <hi>Example</hi> or <hi>Inſtruction?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WOMEN for the generality, are more Baſhful and reſerv'd than Men, and there are things that a Man of the ſtricteſt Morals ſhall not ſcruple to do in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, which yet would ſhock moſt Women, even after Proſtitution: From hence to imagine, that Women are naturally more modeſt than Men, is a Miſtake; all the Difference between them, depends upon Cuſtom and Education; and I am much miſtaken, if this great Power of Faſhions and Inſtruction does not point at a
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002573_0019_0FDB16322B30C340"/>
Remedy, that would be very ſerviceable againſt SELF-POLLUTION. It is a Rule I know among the moſt prudent People, never to mention any thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Vice, to the Youth of either Sex, for fear that either the Deſire after Things forbidden, or elſe Curioſity itſelf, might prompt the Pupils to what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they never might have thought on, had it not been for the too inſtructive Caution of the Teachers. But there are other Methods: The Inſtruction of Youth I hint at, ſhould commence from their Infancy. If Children were ſtrictly forbid, never to touch their Eyes or Noſe, but with their Handkerchief, and that only upon very urgent Neceſſities; if likewiſe they ſaw every Body comply with this Cuſtom, and it was counted abominable to touch them with their naked Hards, I can't ſee why this might not be ſo ſhocking to 'em when grown up, as now the moſt guilty Denuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to well-bred People.</p>
            <p>I Would have the Reader reflect on the Matter I treat of, which differs much from other Points of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality; for in handling other Topicks, a Man may ſafely ſay whatever he thinks any way advantageous to his Deſign; and has nothing to hinder him from rallying together whatever he apprehends neceſſary, and propoſing his Arguments in their utmoſt Extent and Force, making them as plain as poſſible, and anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wering all Difficulties imaginable. But in arguing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Uncleanneſs, eſpecially this ſort of it, which of all, as it is the moſt loathſome, the ſame Liberty is not to be taken, but a Man is extremely confin'd, and is oblig'd to expreſs himſelf with the utmoſt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection and Caution, for fear of intrenching upon Modeſty; which as I promis'd I would not be Guilty of doing, I ſhall all along with the greateſt ſtrictneſs obſerve, as knowing I ſhould be oblig'd to name ſome
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002573_0020_0FDB15F7C50E6730"/>
Things that might betray my Readers into the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of what it is much better that they ſhould for ever forget, as they would not then be able to ſet ſuch a watchful Guard upon their Thoughts and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but that ſome ſoul or filthy Deſires would in Spight creep in; the leaſt imagination only of which, would render them Odious in God's ſight, who ſeeth the Heart, and Delights in none but thoſe who are pure and upright there; with which Apology, hoping it will be thought ſufficient for what Omiſſions and Obſcurity I have been guilty of, I conclude this Chapter.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Frightful Conſequences of <hi>SELF-POLLUTION.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HAVING ſet forth the Heinouſneſs of this Sin in the preceeding Chapter, one might juſtly imagine, that the Impreſſion which the Uglineſs of Incontinence and Uncleanneſs in general there repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented muſt make, would not ſo immediately wear out, as not to ſecure, for ſome ſmall time, the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination even of vicious Perſons againſt any ſlight At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of Unchaſtity; but there are Laſcivious People of ſuch corrupt Minds, that at no time excepted, they may be rais'd to impure Thoughts by bare words, without Coherence, and the Names of Parts, even when made uſe of in the Diſcription of Calamitous Caſes and Nauſeous Diſeaſes; Therefore as I ſhall be
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002573_0021_0FDB1633AE70CB40"/>
forc'd to make uſe of ſome expreſſions in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which tho' ſpoke with a Deſign the moſt remote from Obſcenity, may, working by the reverſe, perhaps furniſh the Fancies of ſilly People with Matter for Impurity; therefore I ſay, I beg of the Reader to ſtop here, and not to proceed any further, unleſs he has a Deſire to be chaſt, or at leaſt be apt to conſider whether he ought to have it or no.</p>
            <p>THE Afflictions which may, and often do fall upon thoſe who are or have been guilty of the ſinful Practice of SELF-POLLUTION, belong either to the Soul or the Body: I ſhall begin with thoſe of the leaſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. In the firſt place, it manifeſtly hinders the Growth both in Boys and Girls, and few of either Sex, that in their Youth commit this Sin to exceſs for any conſiderable time, come ever to that Robuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Strength which they would have arriv'd to without it. In Men as well as Boys, the very firſt Attempt of it has often occaſion'd a <hi>Phymoſis</hi> in ſome, and a <hi>Paraphymoſis</hi> in others; I ſhall not explain theſe Terms any further, let it ſuffice that they are Accidents which are very troubleſome &amp; painful, and may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be tormenting for ſome time, if not bring on Ulcers and other worſe Symptoms; eſpecially if manag'd by raw unskilful People, whom to employ, it is moſt commonly the Fate of young Men, who being conſcious of their Guilt, have not the Aſſurance to addreſs themſelves to Men of Worth and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Whoever wants to know the Signification of thoſe Words, any <hi>Surgeon</hi> will imform him.</p>
            <p>THE frequent Uſe of this POLLUTION; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cauſes <hi>Stranguries, Priapiſms,</hi> and other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the <hi>Penis</hi> and <hi>Teſtes,</hi> but eſpecially <hi>Gonorr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haea's,</hi> more difficult to be cur'd, than thoſe contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Women actually labouring under ſoul Diſeaſes.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002573_0022_0FDB15FDEB4F8640"/>
When the Seminal Veſſels are firſt ſtrain'd, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards relax'd, the Ferment in the <hi>Teſtes</hi> is deſtroy'd and the Seed grown thin and wateriſh, comes away unelaborated, without any provocation; this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per often proves fatal, even under the Hands of the moſt skilful. Theſe <hi>Gonorrhaea's</hi> are chiefly occaſion'd, ſays <hi>Etmuller</hi> (a famous Phyſician) <hi>a damnata Maſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pratione,</hi> from that damnable SELF-POLLUTION; and as Dr. <hi>Baynard</hi> alſo confirms, (ſpeaking of this Practice) by that curſed School-Wickedneſs of Maſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation <hi>(Res faeda dictu)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN ſome it has been the Cauſe of fainting Fits and Epilepſies; in others of Conſumptions; and many young Men who were ſtrong and luſty before they gave themſelves over to this Vice, have been worn out by it, and by its robbing the Body of its balmy and vital Moiſture, without Cough or Spitting, dry and emacia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſent to their Graves. In others again, whom it has not kill'd, it has produc'd Nightly and exceſſive Seminal Emiſſions; a Weakneſs in the <hi>Penis,</hi> and loſs of Erection, as if they had been Caſtrated. <hi>Many a young Gentleman</hi> (ſays the ſame Dr. <hi>Baynard) has been for ever utterly undone by it:</hi> The Reaſon he gives for it, is, <hi>That uſed when young, it ſo forces and weakens the tender Veſſels, that when they come to Manhood, it renders them ridiculous to Women, becauſe impotent, a Curſe half</hi> tanti <hi>to Caſtration; many of them not being able to touch a Woman, but</hi> ad primum labiorum contactum ſemen emittunt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In ſome Men of very ſtrong Conſtitutions, the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs may not be ſo viſible, and themſelves perhaps capable of Marrying; and yet the Blood and Spirits impair'd, and the Seed render'd infertile, ſo as to make them unfit for Procreation, by its changing the Crafts of the Spermatick Parts, making them become bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002573_0023_0FDB16352B9DB1F8"/>
as Land becomes poor by being over-till'd; and few of thoſe that have been much accuſtom'd to this Vice in their Youth, have ever much reaſon to boaſt of the Fruits of their Marriage-Bed; for if by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's extraordinary Helps, they ſhould get any Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which happens not often, they are commonly weakly little ones, that either die ſoon, or become tender, ſickly People, always ailing and complaining; a miſery to themſelves, a diſhonour to humane Race, and a ſcandal to their Parents.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>WITH what Encouragement to Virtue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> ſays a certain Author, <hi>may young People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in a Man at the Age of Fourſcore, with a Wife of the like Antiquity, both bleſs'd with healthy hail Conſtitutions, and freſh wholeſome Countenances, with ſound Minds, and perfect Senſes, with active Limbs, and of chearful Tempers, preſiding over a healthful Progeny, perhaps to the third or fourth Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and all theſe Bleſſings, owing under Providence, to their Temperance and Continence; when if we turn our Eyes upon licentious Maſturbaters, we ſhall find them with meagre Jaws, and pale Looks, with feeble Hams, and Legs without Calves, their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Faculties weakon'd, if not deſtroy'd in the Prime of their Years. A Jeſt to others, and a Torment to themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN Women SELF-POLLUTION if frequently practis'd, relaxes and ſpoils the retentive Faculty, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions the <hi>Flour albus,</hi> an obnoxious as well as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing Illneſs attending that Sex, which upon account of the Womb, may draw on a whole Legion of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; among other Diſorders, it makes 'em look pale, and thoſe who are not of a good Complection, ſwarthy and hagged. It frequently is the Cauſe of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002573_0024_0FDB15FF347A6320"/>
               <hi>Hyſterick Fits,</hi> and ſometimes, by draining away all the radical Moiſture, <hi>Conſumptions.</hi> But what it more often produces than either is <hi>Barrenneſs,</hi> and at length a total ineptitude to the Act of Generation it ſelf, Misfortunes very afflicting to them, becauſe ſeldom to be redreſs'd.</p>
            <p>THE Reaſon why I am not more particular in deſcribing the many Calamities and bodily ſufferings, which this Practice may be the occaſion of in Women, I hope will be obvious to every Reader that is capable of making Reflections. It would be impoſſible to rake into ſo much Filthineſs, as I ſhould be oblig'd to do, without offending Chaſtity. One thing I ſhall add, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing my ſelf to young Women, who have any Eſteem for their Honour, and would keep their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation unſpotted, which is, that many of them who thus defile their Bodies, by being needleſs, or perhaps more fill'd with impure Deſires than ordinary, actually deflower themſelves, and fooliſhly part with that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Badge of their Chaſtity and Innocence, which when once loſt, is never to be retriev'd. This may be the fatal Cauſe whenever they marry, of endleſs Jealouſies and Family-Quarrels, and make their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands ſuſpect more than they have deſerv'd, wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully imagining, that there is but one Way by which Maids may forfeit their Virginity.</p>
            <p>THE next evil Conſequences to be apprehended from SELF-POLLUTION, are all thoſe other Vices which it may lead the way to, and in time be the Occaſion of: Let us once ſuppoſe, what ſome raw ignorant People imagine, that this is only a ſilly Practice, that there is no ſuch great harm in it, and, if it be a Sin, it is at leaſt leſs criminal than <hi>Fornication.</hi> Let us, I ſay, ſuppoſe this, tho' not grant it, and after that, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider what Effects this fooliſh Trick of Youth
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002573_0025_0FDB163A6E7B2798"/>
(as ſome favourably term it) is like to have on either Sex, and what Impreſſion it muſt neceſſarily make on the Minds of thoſe, that have given themſelves over to it.</p>
            <p>AS we are conceiv'd in Sin, it is impoſſible but luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Deſires will now and then ariſe, eſpecially in young People that are in Health. By the Reluctancy which all innocent Perſons feel againſt complying with them, it is eaſily to be diſcover'd, that they are evil, and that the more violently they attack us, the more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly we ought to reſiſt them. While this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict betwixt Luſt and Chaſtity laſt, we are Proof againſt many Temptations, and our Virtue remains trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant. But when once we abandon our Guard, and allow thoſe wanton Thoughts the Liberty of roving and wandering where-e'er they pleaſe, and looſe Fancy can lead them, we make the firſt ſtep to our Undoing; and our Chaſtity is always in Danger, as ſoon as our Dread and great Apprehen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> of loſing it, is gone. We ought not to truſt to frail Reaſon, becauſe it is no Match for our Inclinations, which are infinitely ſtronger. All carnal Temptations ought to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhunned, if it be poſſible; but if met with, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defy'd; for whoever admits of a Parley with Luſt, will be vanquiſh'd at laſt, and is already capitulating with the Enemy. Therefore for our lives, ought we to forbear all Parley with the Fleſh, obſerving the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Rules the Scripture give, between mortifying thoſe Sins the Devil would put us upon, and mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Luſts the Fleſh would tempt us to; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is done by reſiſting, <hi>reſiſt the Devil, and he will flee from you.</hi> There when a Man grows ſtout and couragious, Satan grows cowardly, but it is not ſo with the Buſineſs of the Fleſh; there our greateſt Safety is in flying; when we have to do with Satan,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002573_0026_0FDB1605035DB1C0"/>
the Enemy is without us; but when we have to do with Luſt, the Enemy is within us.</p>
            <p>THE Devil may ſuggeſt to the Haughty and the Baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that in SELF-POLLUTION they'll run no Hazard of their Reputation, and that no body in the World ſhall know it but themſelves; and to the Covetous, that they ſhall loſe nothing by it; or elſe repreſent he Impunity of it to the Cautious and Fearful; but he won't tell them that the All-ſeeing God muſt be a Witneſs to an Act, which his Holineſs ſo much abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, that the greateſt Loſs that can be ſuſtain'd, is that of the Divine Favour, which, to Ballance, the Gain of the whole World is not Equivalent? and that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Damnation infinitely exceeds all Temporal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that can be invented. When the firſt plauſible Suggeſtions are once admitted, the latter Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are at leaſt as certain, are not ſuffered to intrude, or are preſently ſhov'd out as troubleſome Companions. But whatever Reſervedneſs before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they may flatter themſelves with, whenever the Fact is once committed, if it was but a trifling Sin, they can have no Innocence to boaſt of afterwards. The Barrier that fenc'd their Chaſtity is broke, and the Enemy to Purity and Holineſs makes daily Inroads, and ravages through every Paſſage of the conquered Soul.</p>
            <p>THE Senſuality of ſuch, by being the Occaſion of abundance of inordinate Inclinations in them, hurries them on to many Inſtances of Lewdneſs, for ſatisfying this brutiſh Paſſion. But the State of the Soul is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be conſidered; whilſt it is ordinarily poſſeſs'd by luſtful Thoughts and Deſires; the unchaſt Perſon has his Mind rarely free from laſcivious and ſhameful Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations and Fancies, His Heart is a continual
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002573_0027_0FDB163BF9B6EED0"/>
Spring of evil Thoughts, bubling up in it every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So that there needs only the Preſence of an Object to inflame his Deſire. Let him but ſee or hear any thing relating to his beloved Sin, and his Luſt is preſently kindled by it. And not only ſo, but at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times when none of theſe Obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cts preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, his Memory ſerves to furniſh him with ſuch former Paſſages as had gratify'd his Senſuality; theſe he recalls to his Mind, and pleaſes himſelf with the Though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s of them, inſtead of reflecting upon them, as he ought with Sorrow of Heart, and Confuſion of Face.</p>
            <p>WHERE this Sin is become habitual, there muſt be a Diſtaſte to Godlineſs and Virtue in general, and whatever Wantonneſs, obſcene Diſcourſes, ſhameful Actions, and fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>thy Repreſentations are to be met with, (how cautiouſly ſoever they may to the World ſeem to be avoided) are treaſured up with Care, conſtantly to feed this Flame of Impurity. For no ſooner has Uncleanneſs got the Maſtery over the Heart, but forthwith it purſues the Man every where, and keeps its Poſſeſſion of him at all Times, and in all Places. Upon the moſt ſerious Occaſions, and in the very Acts of Religion, he ever and anon finds himſelf tranſported with luſtful Conceptions and Deſires, which inceſſantly follow him, and take up his Thoughts. I ſhall not need to ſay, how great a Part of Mankind find their Mind flag and languiſh, and wander from their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and are full even of wicked Thoughts, when they ſhould be praying to God, or hearkening to his Word. But it is certain, that in many, Impurity is the Cauſe of this Diſorder, a Soul that is not chaſt, will not know how to be devout. To ſuch an one, the holy Exerciſes of Prayer, Meditation, Reading, &amp;c. are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid and unpleaſant. A Love of Voluptuouſneſs is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with ſpiritual Delights, and thoſe pious
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002573_0028_0FDB1606AC51A848"/>
Affections, and Joys, and Raptures, which accompany a ſincere Holineſs of Converſation.</p>
            <p>I Have in the foregoing Chapter ſpoke of ſome, who gave themſelves over to this, and yet were Proof againſt any other groſs Sin of Uncleanneſs, but it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s not ſo with all: Thouſands have been guilty of <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> as well as <hi>Fornication,</hi> who would never have yielded to thoſe Temptations, which overcame them, if they had never been initiated in Laſciviouſneſs, and acquir'd to themſelves a Habit of Impurity by SELF-POLLUTION firſt. In ſuch, not only the groſſer Crimes of Uncleanneſs I juſt now named, but likewiſe all others that may be occaſioned by them, as <hi>Lying, Forſwearing,</hi> perhaps <hi>Murder,</hi> and what not, muſt be laid to the Charge, and brought in as the Effects and Conſequences of their fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AMONG the Conſequences of the Sin I treat of, ought not to be forgot the Troubles and Agonies of a wounded Conſcience, whenever it is rous'd, and makes the polluted ſtartle, affrighted at the Enormity of their Crime. To let the Reader ſee how this Guilt of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Impurity can alarm the Offenders, when they awaken from their Lethargy of Sin, I ſhall inſert the <hi>Preface</hi> to a little Book, entituled, <hi>Letters of Advice from Reverend Divines, to a young Gentleman about a weighty Caſe of Conſcience.</hi> This <hi>Preface,</hi> wrote likewiſe by way of LETTER, is addreſs'd to all young Men, who have or may be tempted to this great Sin in the following Manner.</p>

following Chapter; whom I entreat to lend his ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſideration, on what ſhall be further ſaid is this.</p>
            <p>THERE are many heinous Offenders, who are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd in Sin, and continue in it and all worldly Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without relenting; but few go ſo to their Graves; moſt great Sinners before they die, feel a deep Remorſe, and are tormented with the bitter Stings of Conſcience, upbraiding them with their Guilt, and repreſenting it to them in its true Colours, and moſt frightful Forms. What Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort muſt a Man have, in reflecting on the paſt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Life, who hardly comes to half the Age he might reaſonably have expected to arrive at, finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf enervated by the practice of SELF POLLUTION, his Spirits ſunk, his Body waſted, and his Strength decay'd; in continual Danger of being forc'd to reſign his impure Breath, upon the leaſt Rigour of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or any other ſmall Accident? What Comfort, I ſay, muſt a Man have, when his Crime, repreſenting it ſelf before him, in its moſt ghaſtly Shape, Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall upbraid him, that by ſo many repeated Acts of Murder, he has at laſt deſtroy'd himſelf before he is Thirty Years of Age, as by my own Experience I have known it the caſe of ſeveral? It ſuch great Misfortunes happen but ſeldom, there are other infirmities that may occaſion very diſagreeable Reflections. When Perſons of good Eſtates, in the Flower of their Age, find themſelves bereft of their Manhood, and conſcious of their Impotence, and the curſed Cauſe of it, are forc'd to decline the moſt advantageous Matches, and without the leaſt Hopes of Poſterity, remain the Contempt of others, and a Burden to themſelves; to which perhaps, the Mortification ſhall be added, that the Name and Honour of an Ancient Family, extinct with themſelves, muſt be for ever buried in Oblivion, whilſt the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002573_0031_0FDB163F378E4E28"/>
Seats and venerable Structures of their more vertuous Anceſtors, are inherited or pull'd down by Strangers.</p>
            <p>OTHERS again, who can't be ſaid to die without Offspring, have puny ling'ring Children, more brought up by Phyſick than Kitchin Diet, which they are forc'd to leave at Fourteen or Fifteen Years of Age, perhaps younger, without any probability that they ſhall ever come to Maturity: When Perſons of large Poſſeſſions have no better Views to turn to, than theſe, and withal ſo much Reaſon to lay all the Blame upon themſelves, as the frequent practice of SELF-POLLUTION in their Youth, can furniſh them with, the Proſpect can be but Melancholick. Some Women likewiſe, tho' married to ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d and fertile Husbands, who through the <hi>vileneſs of their Affections,</hi> have <hi>chang'd,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, <hi>the natural uſe into that which is againſt Nature,</hi> are all their Life-time wiſhing for Children in vain; every Year perhaps they change the Air, try all the Baths in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and follow the Advice of moſt Phyſicians, and yet are either ſubject to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Miſcarriages before the Fifth Month, or elſe are never impregnated at all. If ever ſuch Women were guilty of SELF-POLLUTION to Exceſs, and are wiſe enough to know the Conſequences of it, with what Sorrow and Anxieties muſt the Remembrance of it fill them, even when their Troubles are not extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond Temporal Affairs? But when once they are touched with the quick Senſe of their heinous Offences to GOD, how muſt the Reflection on the Things I have named confound the Guilty of either Sex? What Aggravations will they not heap on their Crimes, even to their own Imaginations?</p>
            <p>LET no Body imagine that the Conſequences of this Sin, and all other Acts of Uncleanneſs, will be
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002573_0032_0FDB1609B0197230"/>
leſs Calamitous to thoſe, whom either the bodily Sufferings and Infirmities I have ſpoken of, never reach, or no Temporal Afflictions make any Impreſſion upon, in order to Repentance. Thoſe who never feel any Trouble for their Sin, are oftentimes as inſenſible of the Puniſhments of it, ſuch Puniſhments I mean as befall them by reaſon of it in this Life. Sometimes one may perceive the Judgments of GOD hanging o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Heads of the Unchaſte, and threatning to fall upon them; ſometimes actually and viſibly purſuing them in their own Perſons, or in their Relations, or Affairs in the World, making them groan under the Miſeries, Sorrows, and divers Evils they have brought upon themſelves; and yet we may ſee how little Senſe they have of the Reaſon, why theſe ſad Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are laid upon them, and how ready they are to attribute their Misfortune to any other Cauſe, rather than to themſelves; ſome of them continuing in their Security, till the Judgment of GOD ſeizes them, and they die in their Impenitence, which is the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable and moſt dangerous State a Man can fall into. For ſo long as the Sinner has a Senſe of his Guilt, and the Vengeance juſtly due to him for it, there is ſome hope of him; but when he is come to this Degree of Obduracy, there is very little to be expected from him; for he is then upon the very Brink of Miſery, and but one Step from everlaſting Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>FROM what has been ſaid laſt then, it is manifeſt, that neither our eſcaping the Bodily Sufferings which ſo often enſue upon this Crime, nor our inſenſibility of the Sin, or the Temporal Puniſhments of it, make any Amendment in our Condition; and on the other Side, as evident, from what has been ſaid before, that the Conſequences of this Crime, may on ſeveral Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts render the Reflection on the Cauſe of it, moſt
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002573_0033_0FDB7B08B7E32CB8"/>
terrible to the Offenders, and excite in them ſuch an Inconceivable Indignation againſt themſelves, as (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out GOD's Mercy) cannot poſſibly end but in Deſpair.</p>
            <p>LET us now conſider, once, That theſe Pangs of Conſcience (terrible as they are) are moſt neceſſary to Repentance, which yet no Body can be ſure that it will be accepted. But if thoſe Anxieties to be ſuffer'd on Earth, are moſt frightful to all that will reflect on them, how much more ought the Guilty to ſtand in awe of thoſe other more inevitable, and more intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Puniſhments which are reſerv'd for the other Life? The unclean are not always puniſh'd in this World, but they will be moſt certainly in the next, unleſs they take Care to prevent it, by a timely and hearty Reformation. This the Holy Scripture teaches, as expreſly as may be; <hi>Neither Fornicators,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, nor Adulterers, nor the Abominable, ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God;</hi> cautioning alſo at the ſame time, that we don't abuſe our ſelves, nor flatter our ſelves in this reſpect. And the ſame Doctrine he repeats, Gal. 5.19, 20, 21. <hi>I have told you before, as I have told you in times paſt, that they who commit ſuch things, ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> So Eph. 5.6. <hi>Let no man deceive you with vain words, for becauſe of theſe things, cometh the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> likewiſe, in the 2d Epiſt. Chap. 2. ver. 9. declares and proves by many Examples, that <hi>God reſerves the Wicked,</hi> and chiefly the carnal and impure, <hi>unto the Day of Judgment, to be puniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE are the Conſequences of SELF-POLLU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION; this is that dreadful State to which it brings Men; and theſe the Sins into which it drives them, and the Puniſhment to which it renders them obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.

And one would think them enough to inſpire all Perſons with a Deteſtation againſt this Vice. I am ſure, every one has Reaſon to dread the Thoughts of falling into that Bruitiſhneſs and Hardneſs of Heart, of which all are in great Danger, who at any time paſs the Bounds of Modeſty, and part with their Chaſtity; and ſhould therefore ſeriouſly ſtudy to prevent that Remorſe, which ſooner or later will be the Portion of the Laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious; and to keep at a Diſtance from a Sin, that draws ſo many others after it, and in a Word, caſts its Slaves and Votaries into an Abyſs of Evils.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IN the foregoing Chapter, it has been prov'd, that the Hurt which either Sex may receive from SELF-POLLUTION, is Corporal as well as Spiritual: But becauſe every Body, who but once has committed this Fact, has in a grievous manner offended GOD, and wrong'd his Soul, and many of ſtrong Conſtitutions may for ſome Time have been guilty of this Sin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſiderable, or at leaſt perceptible Harm to their Bodies, yet how to redreſs the ſpiritual Injury received, ſhall be our firſt and chiefeſt Care. There is no Chriſtian who can be ignorant, that no Pardon can be obtain'd for this as well as other Sins, without Repentance in general; but many are apt to deceive
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002573_0035_0FDB7B0E6A0E4028"/>
themſelves concerning the Nature of Repentance, as not well knowing in what it conſiſts; wherefore, it is requiſite I ſhould ſay ſomething of the Manner after which this Duty ought to be performed, as well as the Neceſſity of it.</p>
            <p>THE firſt Branch of Repentance, and the firſt Duty of the polluted, is a Sorrow for what they have done; after this, it is very neceſſary that the Sinner ſhould examine himſelf, to know what Principle it ariſes from; for if his Sorrow only proceeds from any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Affliction, which this Sin already has brought upon him; or the Fear that it may do ſo in time to come, it is not ſaving, unleſs the Sinner makes a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Progreſs, and improves the Almighty's Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to beget in him an unfeign'd Abhorrence of his Tranſgreſſions. Wherefore, the principal Cauſe of his Grief muſt be the greatneſs of the Sin it ſelf, and the woful Eſtate whereinto it brings Men, in relation to GOD and their own Salvation; for it is certain, that no Repentance is acceptable in the ſight of GOD, that does not ariſe from ſuch Meditations as theſe.</p>
            <p>NEITHER is it ſufficient to be ſomewhat grieved and aſhamed; but this Grief muſt be affecting, ſuch as enters deep, and pierces the very Heart, filling it with Sadneſs and Remorſe, Deteſtation and Fear; or if it be not ſuch at the beginning, it muſt be ſuch at length. This is above all others the one infallible Mark of a hearty Sorrow, and ſincere Repentance; that the Sinner finds no longer any Pleaſure or Satisfaction in the things he had formerly delighted in, but ſeeks to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw and get out of the way of them, and finds more Comfort in his Sadneſs and Tears for them: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thoſe that have renounced this and other Sins of Uncleanneſs, have turned aſide another way; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002573_0036_0FDB160FC0681C58"/>
themſelves to Pleaſures of another Nature. But ſo long as they retain an Affection for worldly Pleaſures and Joys of whatſoever kind, this is a certain Sign of their not being touch'd with a true Repentance.</p>
            <p>BUT above all, Care muſt be taken, that this Grief be laſting; for Mens Sorrow is oftentimes but light at the beginning of their Converſion, as will eaſily be apprehended, if we but call to mind that there are two ſorts of Sins. Some there are for which a Man is apt to have an extream Concern, as ſoon as he ever has committed them, and they are ſuch as he is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed into by his own Inclination, nor can take Delight in. Thus, when one has committed Murder, or ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Blaſphemy, he will perhaps be immediately ſtruct with the Horror of his Crime, and a ſtinging Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, by reaſon of it. But it is quite otherwiſe with thoſe Sins into which Men are drawn by Pleaſure, and which gratify their Inclinations, and eſpecially when they are become habitual. Though they take up a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of quitting theſe, they do not at firſt look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 'em with the Averſion due to them; they could yet pleaſe themſelves with them, and it is not without doing Violence to themſelves, and reſiſting their own Inclinations, that they get rid of them. So that their Diſlike of theſe ſorts of Sins is but ſmall at firſt, the Fire of Luſt not being yet wholly extinct. But the chief Commendation of it, is, that it is laſting. And this is what they ought to have an eſpecial regard to, the cauſe of moſt Mens Failings in theſe Attempts, being, that in time the ſenſe of their Crimes abates, and at laſt wears quite away.</p>
            <p>THE Repentance of thoſe who are polluted by this Sin, or any other ſort of Uncleanneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould remain with them to their Lives end. Theſe are not Sins
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002573_0037_0FDB7B10EBF5D860"/>
which a Man can forget, and the Memory of them ought to be always freſh, that the Penitent may truly ſay with <hi>David, My Sins are ever before me.</hi> Not only the time that has paſt ſince the Commiſſion of it, but even an Amendment of Life does not take away the Senſe of ſo great a Fault; but on the contrary he becomes more and more ſenſible of it. Even this Thought, that the Sinner has had the Happineſs to obtain the Pardon of his Guilt, will render the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it the more bitter, and the greater Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs he makes in Holineſs, the more abominable will his wickedneſs appear. The greater Experience he has had of GOD's Mercy, the more he will accuſe and loath himſelf; &amp; the more hope he has of Salvation through GOD's Goodneſs, the more will he be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the danger of being excluded from it to which he had expos'd himſelf.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER great Duty that belongs to Repentance, is Converſion and Amendment: The Guilty muſt forſake their Sin, and continue no longer in it. When our Bleſſed Saviour pardon'd the Woman taken in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,</hi> he ſaid to her; <hi>Go and Sin no more.</hi> The Crime muſt therefore be totally renounc'd; and they which do not this, but relapſe into it, have not repented of it. Every Act, and every repetition of their Sin is an Aggravation of both their Guilt and Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>BUT this is but the beginning of Converſion; and this firſt ſtep will be to no purpoſe, if the Offenders ſtop here; it is not enough to renounce their Crime, without renouncing likewiſe all the Approaches to it: All the ſeveral Species of Imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THERE are two Reaſons why it is neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe Species of Impurity: Firſt, becauſe they will be apt to make Men fall again into the Crime; and then, becauſe a true Repentance is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Defi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ment. The Soul is not changed, whilſt it is not pure, but preſerves a Kindneſs for thoſe filthy and ſhameful Paſſions. In a Word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever there is any Love of Sin, there is no true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
            <p>IT ſuffices not barely to fly Impurity, but they likewiſe muſt ſhew forth their Repentance, by a Life of Mortification; and if it be a general Doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians, not to take Care of the Fleſh but to mortify the Body, and keep it under, and bring it into Subjection, none have more reaſon for the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of theſe Injunctions than thoſe whom the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Fleſh have drawn into Sin. A love of Pleaſures and compliance with the Fleſh, are no where more highly blameable, than in ſuch as are guilty of Impurity. And it muſt alſo be granted, that when
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002573_0039_0FDB7B11D087B080"/>
any one is touch'd with a lively Senſe of this Crime, he goes on no longer in queſt of his vain Delights, he is not then in a Condition to rejoyce and pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but places his Conſolation rather in the Exerciſes of Repentance: Diverſions, and frivilous Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, reading vain Authors, Dreſſing, and the Care of the Body; all theſe make but vain Impreſſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o him. And on the contrary, when choſe that have been impure and diſſolute, and who have left off to Sin, as they have grown into Years, do not mortify themſelves; when they loſe their Eaſe, and make it their ſtudy to obtain the Pleaſures and Advantages of Life, paſſing their time in Idleneſs, or at Play, and ſetting their Minds upon Dainties and ſumptuous Entertainments, moſt certainly theſe are yet in a State of Impenitence, and have never been truly ſenſible of their Fault, not duly ſet themſelves to make amends for it.</p>
            <p>THE Sincerity of Converſion, muſt not only appear in the things which have relation to Impurity, but in the whole Courſe of their Converſation. So great a Fall ſhould render a Man Wiſe, Pious, Circumſpect in all things: All that is in him is to become new: He would take occaſion from every thing to ſhew his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, to diſcharge his Duty towards GOD, to edify his Neighbour, and to purify himſelf more and more. He ought with the greateſt Exactneſs and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity to practice the Duties of Religion, to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Meditation and Prayer, and to be conſtant in Holy Exerciſes, caſting himſelf, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> adviſes, upon GOD, who will not withdraw himſelf from him, nor leave him to fall, but will help him, if he relies upon, and puts confidence in him: There are only two things requir'd of him, one, that he would fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with it; and the other, not to truſt in his own Strength or Prudence, but in the Omnipotence and infinite Love of GOD. He ought likewiſe to do all the Works he ſhall be able, and eſpecially to employ his Goods to the Uſes of Piety and Charity, following the Counſel of the Prophet <hi>Daniel, Redeeming their Sins by Alms, and their Iniquities by ſhewing Mercy to the Poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAPPY are the Guilty who diſcharge theſe Duties aright, who with the ſinful Woman in St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, weep bitterly for their Faults, who have renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and forſaken them, and are altogether converted, <hi>Their Sins, though great ſhall be forgiven them.</hi> Theſe are by no means to be deſpiſed: For there is a great deal of Love due to all Sinners, but more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to ſuch as forſake their Wickedneſs, and cauſe <hi>Joy in Heaven</hi> by their Return.</p>
            <p>BUT he that allows himſelf in any known Sin, is a wicked Man, and he that teaches, or any ways en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages another to commit a Sin, as is too cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily done in the Practice of SELF-POLLUTION, is likewiſe a wicked Man, for he is Partner with him in that Sin which he tempts him to, and conſequently without ſincere Repentance, muſt expect to ſhare with him in the Puniſhment; and no wicked Man hath any Portion in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

Now ſuch Acts are noted in the Scripture, as horrible Crimes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe otherwiſe many might commit them, and not know the Evil of them. It is conceived that his Brother <hi>Er,</hi> before, was his Brother in Evil thus far, that both of them ſatisfied their Senſuality againſt the Order of Nature, and therefore the Lord cut them off both alike, with ſudden Vengeance, which may be for the Terror of thoſe, who in the neglect

Do not handle thoſe Parts at any Time, but when Neceſſity of Nature requires, for handling of them puffs up, irritates and raiſes Fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inclinations; and I ſhould think likewiſe, that it will be good, after you have humbled your ſelf ſo far for this Sin as to forſake it, then not to think of it any more, or as little as ever you can; for even the thinking upon that Sin, doth but renew the Deſire of it.

and make them ſwell, even as upon other Occaſions, they ſend them to the Muſcles in the Legs or Arms, when we would uſe them.

Reader, after he hath peruſed this little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, to judge whether it be reaſonable to think, that any Mortal ſhould be induc'd to run the Hazard of drawing upon themſelves the frightful Conſequences of SELF-POLLUTION, as here related, by what has been ſaid of the Poſſibility of being Cur'd, when la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under them: More eſpecially, when I ſhall have added the Caution I intend to conclude with, and which is, <hi>That whatever Remedies may be applied, or Phyſicians made uſe of, no Rule nor Preſcription, can ever be effectual in removing the Bodily Infirmities occaſion'd by SELF-POLLUTION, without they are likewiſe accompany'd with an entire Ceſſation of this Practice, a total Abſtinence from the Sin it ſelf, and an unalterable Reſolution of never falling into it again, and that all Relapſes are ever fatal in thoſe Caſes.</hi>

            <p>THOUGH I am altogether a Stranger to your Perſon, yet having read a little Book of yours, I am become acquainted with your refined Notions, and like what you have ſaid againſt one particular Species of Uncleanneſs: I bought your Book in hopes you had ſaid ſomething concerning the Married State; what Decorum there muſt be obſerv'd not to defile the Marriage Bed; I wiſh you had ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more on that Point, for the ſake of ſome of my own Sex, I have diſputed with: They have ſuch groſs Notions, they imagine the Marriage-Bed can't be defil'd unleſs they commit <hi>Adultery.</hi> I fancy, <hi>Sir,</hi> you have finer Thoughts than to think Marriage a Proviſion for the Man's Brutality, therefore I have uſed the Freedom to addreſs my ſelf to you, hoping you will vouchſafe to tell me whether I am not right in this Particular. First then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I conſider thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations were given for the Continuance of our Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and no other end, and Marriage inſtituted that it might be in a decent regular manner; therefore, <hi>Fornication</hi> was forbid, not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the Creative Power, and very properly I think you term it Murder. Now what is in ſelf Evil, Marriage can't make Good, therefore I conclude the Marriage-Bed defil'd, the Man and Wife committing Sin, when the End can't be had for which that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was given; for tho' the Man be at all Times capable of Generation, the Woman is not, as when ſhe has Conceiv'd; and when ſhe, accoring to the Courſe of Nature, is past it, it then centers in the Pleaſure of Senſe, and is a Frustraneous Abuſe of their Bodies, the ſame in my Opinion with SELF-POLLUTION and SODOMY. The Man being at all Times capable of Generation, has made me ſometimes think the Men might have Plurality of Wives; but then I conſider, GOD made but one Woman for the Man. <hi>Sir,</hi> I'll tire you no longer with my Impertinency, only to beg Pardon for this Freedom, and to crave the Favour of a Line or two, which I aſſure you <hi>Sir,</hi> will infinitely oblige her that is</p>

            <p>THE Reaſon why in the ONANIA, I did not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with any Part of Uncleanneſs relating to the Married-State, is, becauſe I always did as I ſtill do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:002573_0059_0FDB7B505004C4E0"/>
that no Branch of it could have any Affinity with the Sin of ONAN, and conſequently was foreign to my Purpoſe. But as your ingenious Letter, and the Scruple you ſeem to labour under, are well worthy of the moſt ſerious Reflections, I ſhall endeavour, as far as I am able, to ſatisfy you in the Particular on which you require my pinion; and in order to it, deſire you to be referr'd to the following Anſwer.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt Place I am altogether of your Opinion, and think it undeniable, that the Inclinations you hint at were given us for the continuane of our Species, and no other End. Secondly, I am forc'd to allow, that where that End cannot be had, as when the Woman has conceiv'd or by the Courſe of Nature is paſt it, all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces are Fruſtraneous, and can center in nothing but the Pleaſure of ſenſe, and I would think my ſelf oblig'd to ſubſcribe to all the Conſequences you can infer from it, if I was not aſſur'd that you are miſtaken as to the End of Marriage and the Sinfulneſs of <hi>Fornication.</hi> In Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the latter you imagine that it is forbid, not becauſe it is in it ſelf Evil, but as it is deſtructive to the good of Society: This is a dangerous Aſſertion, and gives too great a handle for <hi>Deiſts</hi> and other <hi>Libertines,</hi> who would perſwade the World, that Religion is only a Political Invention, and no farther to be minded, than as it is Beneficial to the Order and Government of Society.</p>
            <p>THE only Rule a Chriſtian is to walk by, is the Word of God; where his Precept is Plain, we are reſtrain'd from any other Standard of the Lawfulneſs or Unlawfulneſs of an Action whether it brings a viſible Good or a viſible Evil, either to our ſelves or the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. The Juſtice of GOD is as incomprehenſible, as his Mercy. What could, to humane Underſtanding, be more innocent than the Eating of an Apple? And yet
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:002573_0060_0FDB7B30D261E6F0"/>
what Crime was ever more ſeverely puniſh'd? The Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> was not Luxury, nor Wantonneſs, but Diſobedience, and conſiſted ſolely in the Tranſgreſſion of a direct Command of his Creator; that <hi>Fornication</hi> is forbid, is plain from Holy Writ; but why is it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, is Arrogance to determine. When our Notions are too much refin'd, they are apt to lead us into Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. You ſay that <hi>Fornication</hi> not making for the good of Society, it is better one Man abide by one Women, that there may be a due care taken of the Offsprings Education: This is as ſtrong an Argument againſt <hi>Poligamy,</hi> as it is againſt <hi>Fornication,</hi> and therefore is not calculated for the good of Societies in general; for among the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and thoſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens whoſe Religion allows them a Plurality of Wives, there are Nations as Flouriſhing and Populous as there are among the Chriſtians, and the Neglect of the Offspring is no greater Complaint among them than it is among us. What you add to ſtrengthen your Argument, that to be Inſtrumental to introduce poor Creatures into the World, and not to take Care of them, is to be worſe than the Brutes, I will eaſily grant, but am apt to think, that in ſaying this, you made not a due Reflection on the true Reaſon why <hi>Fornication</hi> among us, is ſo often the Cauſe of this Piece of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity which you juſtly condemn.</p>
            <p>MARRIAGE is honourable throughout Chriſtendom, not ſo much on a Religious Account, and becauſe it is a State entered into by the Inſtitution of GOD; but chiefly as it is a Faſhion and Cuſtom every way countenanc'd and encourag'd by the Laws of the Land, a Formality, which we ſee that even thoſe of the higheſt Rank, Kings and Emperors not excepted, are proud to ſubmit to. Among all Ranks and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of People, there are Women deeply involved in
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:002573_0061_0FDB7B5198DCF1C8"/>
Sin, and wholly neglectful of almoſt every Chriſtian Duty; yet thoſe of them who are Faſhionable, and would be counted to underſtand themſelves, will, out of Pride only, without any other Conſideration, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways refuſe to converſe with any of their Sex, that are openly known to have forfeited their Honour. As by this caution Strumpets are render'd deſpicable, ſo becomes their Offspring, and all Baſtards muſt infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bring Shame and Ignominy, which prove ſo often fatal to the Lives as well as Fortunes of illegitimate Children. But notwithſtanding all this, thoſe who are Spurious, and born out of Wedlock, are only infamous in Compariſon to thoſe who are born in Wedlock from the ſame Parents, or others of the ſame Degree: The natural Son of a great Prince, will always have the Precedency of the moſt legitimate Child of a Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; from whence it is plain, that in a Country where one Man was not to be confin'd to one Woman, and no Body was to be Married, the Iſſue of one Woman would not be leſs honourable to the Father, than the Iſſue of another, and conſequently no Man could be aw'd by that Ignominy and Reproach, which with us are certainly the chief, if not the only Cauſes of the little Proviſion you complain, is generally made for the Offspring of <hi>Fornication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is not to be imagin'd, that Men or Women ſhould take leſs Care of their Offspring than other Creatures, if they were not diverted from it by a more preſſing Motive than Brutes are capable of acting from. Avarice is ſometimes more powerful then the ſtrongeſt Ties of Nature; and the Fear of Death it ſelf, is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the fear of Shame only: However our Paſſions may impoſe upon us, Men generally love every Thing for their own ſakes, and Self love is, conſpicuous, even in Suicide. The Love of rational Creatures to their
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:002573_0062_0FDB7B32C5A246A8"/>
Children, ariſes not ſo much from a natural Inſtinct, as is commonly imagin'd, and depends very much on the Delight they take in, and the various Comforts they receive from them; and if we would enter into the true Cauſe why illegitimate Children are generally more neglected than others, we muſt compare the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of having half a dozen Baſtards, to the Applauſe and Credit which People receive from the Education and all the good Qualities of ſo many lawful Children, and we ſhall find that it is altogether owing to the Shame &amp; Ignominy of it, occaſion'd by a Cuſtom, which never could be introduced in any Society, before Marriage had been Time out of Mind in faſhion among them. I have urged this ſo far to make it evident, that you are miſtaken as to the End of Marriagei; becauſe it would be abſurd to imagine that Marriage was inſtituted to prevent a Miſchief, which could have no Being, if People did not Marry at all. Marriage then is of a more Sacred Original, and was inſtituted for Reaſons more worthy of the Holineſs of GOD, than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of temporal Felicity, the Good of Society, or any other political Conſideration. Throughout the Scriptures it is manifeſt, that GOD has no greater A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to any Thing than Uncleanneſs of all Sorts; it would be inconſiſtent with his Purity, that he ſhould ſuffer rational Creatures, made after his own Image, promiſcuouſly to mix themſelves with one another like brute Beaſts: For this Reaſon he has will'd, that one Man ſhould abide with one Woman, and, <hi>vice verſa,</hi> till the Death of either; and to render this Agreement for Life more ſolemn, he has honour'd it with that Inſtitution which we call Marriage.</p>
            <p>FROM what has been ſaid, it will eaſily appear, that the moſt palpable End of Matrimony to be trac'd from Holy Writ, is to prevent the Sin of Uncleanneſs,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:002573_0063_0FDB7B544A844E78"/>
that is, hinder all People in whom Carnal Deſires are ſtirred up, from <hi>Fornication,</hi> SELF-POLLUTION, and other ſorts of Defilements. From this End of Matrimony I argue thus; Whatever, inſtead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting, is deſtructive to the ſacred End of Marriage, could never be requir'd from us by GOD; but the Forbearance you plead for is ſuch, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it could never, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for Inſtance, could you imagine that a young luſtful Man, full of Health, after having lain four or five Weeks with a Woman he likes, ſhould now be more able to reſtrain and curb his carnal Appetites, than he was before he had touchd a Woman? Matrimony at this Rate, inſtead of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering People more chaſte, would ſerve rather to whet their Luſt, and prompt them on to all manner of Uncleanneſs. If it be objected, that a laſting Sickneſs of the Wife, or the long Abſence of the Husband, to which moſt Military, and all Seafaring Men are ſubject, may produce the ſame Inconveniency, I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, that there is a great difference between Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and Misfortunes, that may put a ſtop to the Commerce between a Man and his Wife, and a ſettled Abſtinence as it were entail'd on the State of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and which you imagine all married People ought to comply with. Beſides, the Sickneſs of the Wife is a Calamity inflicted by the Hand of GOD on the Husband, as well as her ſelf, and may ſerve to put them both in mind of their Duty: And thoſe who are expoſed to the Sea, or engag'd in other perilous Enterprizes, may even from thence reap Materials to ſubdue Luſt and other diſorderly Paſſions; and in theſe Caſes, to overcome all Temptation, they ſhall have the expreſs Word of GOD to aſſiſt them: The Hope of everlaſting Glory may excite them to the Obedience of the divine Commands, as the Fear of eternal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment may deter them from doing Evil, for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:002573_0064_0FDB7B3462BFFF00"/>
the Man or his Wife be Sick or Well, preſent or far off, the nuptial Vow, till the Death of either ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates the Union, cannot be broke, and GOD's Command againſt Adultery is as plain as it is ſtrict.</p>
            <p>BUT what ſhall we ſay to a young Couple, both in Health, that live in Peace and Harmony, and have been a conſiderable Time ſtriving to render themſelves delightful and endearing to each other? How ſhall they practice this Forbearance, when every Night, naked, they lie in the ſame Bed together, as moſt mean People can make no other Shift? This to ſome would be an inſupportable Temptation: But what Reaſons, what Inducements, ſhall make them undergo this ſevere Abſtinence, or rather excruciate themſelves with this intollerable Pennance? What Hope have they to excite them to this extraodinary Piece of Purity, or what can frighten them from an imaginary Sin, againſt which there is no expreſs Command of GOD? Nay, which way ſhall they imagine That to be a Tranſgreſſion, concerning which the Scriptures are altogether ſilent, both Old and New Teſtament?</p>
            <p>IT is inconſiſtent with the Goodneſs, nay the Juſtice of GOD, that any Action in his Eye ſhould be ſo heinous a Sin as Sodomy, and that he either by his Precept, or the Example of Puniſhment in others, ſhould not have warn'd us againſt it. There are many Duties incumbent on married People that are expreſly commanded, and not ſo eaſily obſerv'd: The real Difficulties that may occur in that State, are ſufficient; we need not, by being over nice, invent any more.</p>
            <p>I Am of your Opinion, that there is a Decorum to be obſerv'd as to the Marriage-Bed, and therefore
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:002573_0065_0FDB7B5542E5D240"/>
think that all Exceſſes and Indecencies, that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive either to Health or Chaſtity, are Sinful, and from this I have my Warrant from Scripture; but I likewiſe think that it cannot actually be defiled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a third Perſon, and then my Sentiment is, that all ſhameful Freedoms with others, defile it almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually with Adultery it ſelf. The Compliment you deſign me, by fancying that I have finer Thoughts than to think Marriage a Proviſion for the Man's Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, I cannot accept of, for I ſincerely believe that State to be a lawful Refuge to all, who from a Fault either of their Conſtitution or manner of Living, find themſelves incapable of remaining ſingle without Sin; therefore I would not ſcruple to call Marriage a Proviſion for Incontinence in either Sex.</p>
            <p>BUT I am at a loſs for the meaning of the word Brutality; for if you give this Name to all Embraces in general, you include the moſt Lawful ones, even thoſe tending only to Procreation, &amp; then the Expreſſion is very injurious; but if you call ſo all Commerce with Women after they have conceiv'd, or are paſt it, the Word is the moſt improper in the World; for how can that be Brutality, what Brutes are not won't to do?</p>
            <p>I WOULD not have you tell me, that what I ſay now, ſhews the Practice to be againſt Nature, and that Men, always refining upon their Paſſions, have by their Luxury wrapt the very Bent of their natural Appetites, and ſo accuſtomed themſelves to Enormities, which Beaſts themſelves are not guilty of. There is a vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt irrational Creatures and our own Species; we may often obſerve the ſame Operations in both from very different Principles. It is true, that the Females of moſt Brutes never admit the Males all the Time of their Pregnancy. But at the Seaſons
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:002573_0066_0FDB7B35DF2DBC38"/>
when their procreative Appetite ſtimulates them to Coition, ſuch a Ferment is ſtirr'd up within them, as Advertiſes all Males round them, and ſome at a great diſtance, of their Salacity. The Females that are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with this, are always capable of being impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and without it no Male ſollicites them. I need not tell you that our Species is deſtitute of this Piece of Knowledge; but ſhall only obſerve, that the very want of this Inſtinct in Men, is another Argument againſt you. For is it to be imagin'd, that GOD ſhould have denied us a Faculty, (granted to Brutes) if it was of ſo great a Concern to our eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as this would be, if what you urge was true? Would it not be claſhing with the divine Juſtice, to have made an Action heinouſly Criminal, of which we are not ſure whether we commit it or not?</p>
            <p>THE Buſineſs of Conception is full of Uncertainty; Many Women, even ſuch as had been Mothers before, have been impos'd upon by Flatulencies and other Ailments, and thought themſelves with Child, and to be Deliver'd, when at laſt they have brought forth nothing but Wind; others again have attributed that to Diſeaſes, for Months together, which has been really owing to their being impregnated, and fallen in Labour before they ſuſpected themſelves to be with Child: And in ſome the only Sign to be rely'd on that Women have not Conceiv'd, has continu'd to appear regularly all the Time of their Pregnancy. Multitudes of Women likewiſe, have had reaſon to think themſelves paſt Child-bearing, and after that brought fine Children into the World: From whence it is evident, that if what you condemn, was ſo heinous a Sin as <hi>Sodomy,</hi> and by every Body believed to be ſuch, Procreation it ſelf would ſuffer very much. The Danger of committing ſo capital a Crime, would render
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:002573_0067_0FDB7B5B4DE95EF0"/>
good People cautious beyond Neceſſity. The Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty I have ſpoke of, would raiſe a thouſand Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to obſtruct the nuptial Enjoyments, and the Fear of having conceiv'd already, would in many Caſes hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from conceiving at all.</p>
            <p>THERE is in the Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Circumſtance that ſeems to make againſt you, and which I would have you ſeriouſly to conſider. If GOD has willed, that Men ſhould practiſe the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance you urge, it is not to be thought that the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> to whom GOD has from Time to Time revealed himſelf in ſo peculiar a Manner, could have been ignorant of it. <hi>Abraham</hi> then we'll ſay was well acquainted with GOD's Will as to this particular; but how comes it, that in this Part of the ſacred Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, there is not the leaſt Shadow of Reaſon to make us believe, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had left off all carnal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with <hi>Sarah,</hi> when it had ceas'd with her to be after the Manner of Women, but rather the contrary? For had <hi>Abraham</hi> diſcontinued the nuptial Embraces, there is no doubt but he would have acquainted <hi>Sarah</hi> with the Reaſon of it, which alone would have been ſufficient Ground for her Disbelief, when the <hi>Angel</hi> foretold that ſhe was to a have Son. She knew that when ſhe was young, and her Husband likewiſe in the Prime of his Age, and there was no viſible Impediment why ſhe ſhould have no Children, ſhe had all along re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd infertile, which made her wonder how ſhe ſhould now conceive, when ſhe had ſuch manifeſt To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of being paſt Child-bearing, and her Husband was of a declining Age, and his Vigour much diminiſhed. It was this that provoked her Laughter; ſhe was far from reflecting on the Forbearance of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Benevolence, and ſeemed rather, when ſhe laughed, conſcious of the many fruitleſs Endeavours they had
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:002573_0068_0FDB7B3D409961A0"/>
made ſince their Youth. It is likewiſe to be obſerved, that when <hi>Sarah</hi> ſaid that her Lord was <hi>likewiſe</hi> Old, ſhe could not mean that he was impotent by Age, and incapable of performing the conjugal Rites: The contrary appeared after <hi>Sarah</hi>'s Death; for he marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another Wife, and had at leaſt ſix Children by her, ſo that ſhe only called him Old in reſpect to his firſt Vigour, which certainly was decreas'd.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, if <hi>Sarah</hi> had the leaſt Suſpicion that it was a Sin for Men to meddle with their Wives after they were paſt Child-bearing, ſhe would never have alledged, as a Reaſon of her Unbelief, that her Lord <hi>likewiſe</hi> was Old; for if the Act it ſelf had been an Indecency, a Thing never practis'd, what had it ſignified whether <hi>Abraham</hi> was Old or Young?</p>
            <p>WHEN in the beginning of this LETTER, I allowed the Embraces you condemn to be fruſtraneous, I would only be underſtood as to Procreation; for elſe it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt they are of great uſe to Society: They are the Bond of conjugal Amity, and by their means a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand little Differences and petty Quarrels are made up between a Man and his Wife, which without them would become wide Breaches, and often render the married Couple for ever irreconcileable. That (as you ſay) they only center in the Pleaſure of Senſe, is true, but ſo does Muſick, yet it is not forbid us. What I ſay of SELF-POLLUTION, you would apply to this, which is wrong. SELF-POLLUTION is not Murder, becauſe what is waſted might prove a Child; if it were, all nocturnal POLLUTIONS, which no Body can prevent, would be ſo many Murders: But becauſe the Seed is waſted in a ſinful Manner, it is a Crime, which GOD has puniſh'd with Death. This ought not to be confounded with an Action which GOD allows of, if not encourages.</p>
