            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

What Effect a Diſcourſe of this
<pb facs="unknown:003624_0003_1002355E97053810"/>
Nature will have upon the Minds of thoſe who ſhould have ſo much Patience as to read it, I know not; but muſt leave that to him who hath the Hearts of all Men in his Hand. My Subject I am ſure is good and neceſſary: And as for my plain and practical way of handling it, it is that which my Text requireth, in that it commanded, that in our Chriſtian Congregations, <hi>All Things be done to Edifying.</hi> So that unleſs I had endeavoured to ſuit it to the Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all there preſent, and to make it as <hi>Edifying</hi> as I could unto them, my Sermon had been a Contradiction to my Text: And beſides that, I had loſt my Deſign in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: Which was, to convince thoſe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, whoſe Souls, under your Lordſhip, are committed to my Care and Conduct, of <hi>the Excellency and Uſefulneſs of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer,</hi> and ſo to perſuade them to the conſtant and conſcientious Uſe of it; not only becauſe it is conformable to the Doctrine, Diſcipline, and Practice of the Univerſal Church, nor only becauſe it is eſtabliſhed by the Laws both of our Church and State (though they alſo be very great Reaſons) but likewiſe becauſe that Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Benefit and Advantage which they would receive from it, for the <hi>Edifying</hi> of
<pb facs="unknown:003624_0004_1002356270CFAE88"/>
their Souls in whatſoever is neceſſary to their Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible, that much more might have been ſaid upon this Excellent Subject; but intending no more than a plain Sermon upon the Occaſion, I was forced to omit many things, and to confine my ſelf to ſuch only, which were moſt obvious, and ſeemed the moſt neceſſary for People to know and practiſe, in order to their being reconciled unto, and <hi>Edified</hi> by our Publick Prayers. And if upon Your peruſal of that little which I have ſaid, You ſhall find any thing not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Doctrine of our Church, I humbly ſubmit it to Your Lordſhip's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Cenſure; only deſiring that you would be as ready to pardon, as I am to retract it.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN <hi>Judas Maccabeus</hi> had new built the Altar, and repaired the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> after it had been polluted and laid waſte for Three Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Church of God at that time and place rejoiced ſo much at it, that they kept the Dedication of it eight Days, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that the ſame ſhould be obſerved every Year, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 4.59. And ſo we find it was in our Saviour's time; for he himſelf was pleaſed to honour that Feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tival, though only of Eccleſiaſtical Inſtitution, with his own Preſence, <hi>John</hi> 10.22. In the like manner, we of this Pariſh have Cauſe to be tranſported with Joy and Gladneſs, and to ſpend this Day in praiſing and adoring the moſt High God, for that our Church which hath lain waſte for above five times Three Years, is now at laſt rebuilt and fitted again, for his Worſhip and Service. For what the Altar and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were unto the <hi>Jews</hi> then, the ſame will our Church be unto us now. Did they there offer up their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices unto God, as Types of the Death of Chriſt? We ſhall here commemorate the ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Death of Chriſt, typified by thoſe Sacrifices. Did they come from all parts of <hi>Judea</hi> to worſhip God there?
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003624_0007_100235665623C150"/>
So ſhall we, I hope, come from all parts of this Pariſh to worſhip God here. Was the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple an Houſe of Prayer to them? So is this Church to us. Was that the place where God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Promiſe, came unto his People to bleſs them? I do not doubt but he will do the ſame to us in this place, if we come unto it, and carry our ſelves in it as we ought to do. In ſhort, was the Temple the place where all things were performed, that could any way conduce to the <hi>Edifying</hi> of God's People, as things then ſtood? The ſame may be ſaid of our Church, as things now ſtand. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is, or can be, Neceſſary to the <hi>Edifying</hi> of our Souls here, and ſo to their Eternal Salvation hereafter, is clearly and fully comprehended in thoſe ſeveral Offices, which according to the Laws of the Land, are now to be performed in this placed. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any thing contained in any of them, but what doth really conduce to theſe great Ends and Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>BUT this being a thing which is denied by ſome, and underſtood but by few amongſt us, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to explain and demonſtrate unto all. Which I chuſe to do at this time, becauſe it is the moſt proper Subject I could think of for this Occaſion. For unleſs what is to be now done in this place, will anſwer the Ends wherefore it is erected, all the Coſts and Charges that have been laid out upon it, will be to no purpoſe at all. But if it can be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made out, That the Service which is here to be performed, doth highly conduce to the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God's Glory and your Happineſs, the great End wherefore ſuch places are erected, then you cannot but acknowledge, that whatſoever any of you have contributed towards it, is the beſt Money that ever you ſpent; and that this Day, wherein the ſaid Service is begun to be performed in it, is one of the moſt joyful days that this Pariſh ever ſaw.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:003624_0008_1002357566551470"/>THIS therefore is that which I ſhall endeavour to prove at this time: And for that end I have choſen theſe Words for the Ground and Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all that I ſhall ſay upon this Subject. <hi>Let all Things be done to Edifying.</hi> For the right Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding whereof we muſt know, that the Apoſtle having in this Chapter diſcourſed at large concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way and manner of holding Chriſtian Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, and having proved, that whatſoever is there ſaid, ought to be ſpoken in ſuch a Language, that all there preſent may underſtand, and ſo be <hi>edified</hi> by it; he at laſt ſums up the whole in this Propoſition; <hi>How is it then Brethren? When ye come together, every one of you hath a Pſalm, hath a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, hath a Tongue, hath a Revelation, hath an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation: Let all Things be done to Edifying</hi>: As if he ſhould have ſaid, Whatſoever Gifts any of you have, or pretend to, yet when you meet together upon a Religious Account, for the Publick Worſhip of God, take ſpecial care that <hi>all Things be</hi> there <hi>done, to</hi> the <hi>Edifying</hi> of all who are there preſent. From whence it is plain, that the Apoſtle lays down this as a general Rule, neceſſary to be obſerved in all Chriſtian Congregations. So that whenſoever we meet together to Worſhip and Serve God, if any thing be there done which is not for our <hi>Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> we come ſhort of this Rule, and ſo we do too, if any thing be there wanting that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to that end. For according to this Rule, as nothing is to be there done but what is for our <hi>Edifying,</hi> ſo alſo on the other ſide, all Things that are, or can be, for our <hi>Edifying,</hi> ought to be there done.</p>
            <p>BUT for our better underſtanding the true Senſe and Purport of this Rule, it is neceſſary to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what the Apoſtle here means by <hi>Edifying</hi>: For which we muſt know, That all Chriſtians being, as
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003624_0009_10023567E25BDA48"/>
the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>of the Houſhold of God, built upon the Foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief Corner-ſtone,</hi> Eph. 2.19, 20. Hence whatſoever tends to the Strengthening, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, Cementing, or Raiſing this Fabrick higher, whatſoever it is whereby Men are made more firm and ſolid Chriſtians, more Holy and Perfect Men than they were before, by that they are ſaid to be <hi>Edified.</hi> And therefore it is a great Miſtake for Men to think, as many do, that they are <hi>Edified</hi> by what they hear, merely becauſe they know per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome little thing which before they were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of. For <hi>Knowledge</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>puffeth up,</hi> it is <hi>Charity that Edifieth,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.1. And therefore, whatſoever Knowledge we attain to, we cannot be ſaid to be <hi>Edified</hi> by it any further than as it influences our Minds, excites our Love, and inclines our Hearts to God and Goodneſs. And that this is the rrue Notion of <hi>Edifying,</hi> is plain from the Apoſtle's own Words, where he ſaith, <hi>Let no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Communication come out of your Mouths, but that which is for the uſe of Edifying, that it may miniſter Grace unto the Hearers,</hi> Eph. 4.29. For from hence it is manifeſt, that that only is properly ſaid to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dify,</hi> that miniſters Grace unto us; whereby we are made more Pure and Holy than we were before. And therefore, we read of <hi>Edifying our ſelves in Love,</hi> Eph, 4.16. <hi>And building up our ſelves in our moſt holy Faith,</hi> Jude 20. which are the two Graces that make up a real and true Chriſtian. And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſaid to <hi>Edify,</hi> but what tends to the exciting and increaſing of them: <hi>Until we come</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>in the Unity of the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the Fulneſs of Chriſt</hi>

God, all things there are to be ſo done, that we may return home wiſer, and better than we came thither; with our Knowledge of God and Chriſt increaſed, our Deſires inlarged, our Love inflamed, our Faith confirmed, all our Graces quickned, and ſo our whole Souls made more humble, more Holy, more like to God, than they were before.</p>
            <p>THE Words being thus briefly explained, I ſhall now apply them to our preſent purpoſe, and ſhew that that Form of Religious Worſhip, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by our Church, eſtabliſhed by the Laws of the Land, and therefore to be uſed now in this place, agrees exactly with this Rule, or Canon of the Holy Apoſtle, even that <hi>all things in it are done to Edifying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT before we prove that that Form in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, which our Church hath preſcribed, is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this <hi>Apoſtolical Rule,</hi> it is neceſſary to prove firſt, That the preſcribing a Form in general is ſo. For unleſs the preſcribing a Form in general, be according to this Rule, no Form in particular, that is preſcribed, can poſſibly agree with it. But now that this Rule admits, yea, requires the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing of ſome Form, is evident from the Rule it ſelf. For the Apoſtle here commands the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and ſo all Provincial Churches, to take care that in their Religious Aſſemblies <hi>all Things be done to Edifying.</hi> But how is it poſſible for any Provincial Church to ſee that this be done, except ſhe preſcribes ſome certain Form for the doing of it? If every <hi>Miniſter</hi> of a <hi>Pariſh</hi> ſhould be left to his own Liberty, to do what he pleaſed in his own Congregation, although ſome perhaps might be ſo wiſe and prudent as to obſerve this Rule, as well
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003624_0011_1002356A40C2CB30"/>
no way ſecured that all would; and therefore muſt needs be obliged to conſider of, and appoint ſome ſuch Form to be uſed in all her Congregations, by which ſhe may be fully aſſured, that this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Rule is every where obſerved, as it ought to be. And although we ſhould ſuppoſe what can never be expected, that all the Clergy in every Province ſhould be as wiſe and as good as they ought to be, yet it cannot be ſuppoſed that every one of them ſhould underſtand what is for the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification</hi> of the People, as well as all together. And therefore it muſt needs be acknowledged, that the ſureſt way to have this Rule obſerv'd, is, for the Governors of every Church, and the whole Clergy, to meet together by their Repreſentatives in a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, or Convocation, and there, upon mature Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, agree upon ſome ſuch Form, which they in their Prudence and Conſciences judge to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Rule, which the Apoſtle here lays down before them.</p>
            <p>AND beſides that, the preſcribing a Form in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, is more for our <hi>Edifying,</hi> than to leave every one to do what ſeems good in his own Eyes. We have the concurrent Teſtimony, Experience, and Practice of the Univerſal Church. For we never read or heard of any Church in the World, from the Apoſtles days to ours, but what took this courſe. Though all have not uſed the ſame, yet no Church but have uſed ſome Form or other. And therefore for any Man to ſay, that it is not Lawful; or not Expedient, or not ſo <hi>Edifying,</hi> to uſe a Form of Prayer in the Publick Worſhip of God, is to contradict the general ſenſe of Chriſtianity, to condemn the Holy Catholick Church, and to make himſelf wiſer than all Chriſtians that ever were before him. Which, whatſoever it may be thought now, was always here <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> Sins and Follies</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:003624_0012_10023578AC5D50A8"/>NAY, more than all this too: For this is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make a Man's ſelf wiſer than all Chriſtians, but wiſer than <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf: For it is impoſſible to preſcribe any Form of Prayer in more plain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Terms than he hath done it, where he ſaith, <hi>When ye Pray, ſay, Our Father which art in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.2. And I hope none here preſent but will acknowledge that Chriſt, by whom alone we can be <hi>Edified,</hi> knows better what is, or what is not for our <hi>Edification,</hi> than we, or all the Men in the World can do. And therefore ſeeing he hath not only preſcribed a Form of Prayer for his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to uſe, but hath expreſly commanded them to uſe it, we, who profeſs our ſelves to be his Diſciples, ought to reſt fully ſatisfied in our Minds, that uſing of a Form of Prayer is not only Lawful, but much more for our <hi>Edifying,</hi> than it is poſſible for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of Praying to be.</p>
            <p>THE ſame may be proved alſo from the Nature of the thing it ſelf, by ſuch Arguments, which do not only demonſtrate that it is ſo, but likewiſe ſhew how it comes to be ſo. For <hi>Firſt,</hi> In order to our being <hi>Edified,</hi> ſo as to be made better and holier, whenſoever we meet together upon a Religious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it is neceſſary, that the ſame good and holy Things be always inculcated and preſſed upon us af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one and the ſame manner. For we cannot but all find by our own Experience, how difficult it is to faſten any thing that is truly good, either upon our ſelves or others, and that it is rarely, if ever ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, without frequent Repetitions of it. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good things we hear only once, or now and then, though perhaps upon the hearing of them, they may ſwim for a while in our <hi>Brains,</hi> yet they ſeldom ſink down into our <hi>Hearts,</hi> ſo as to move and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

as, by a <hi>Set Form of Publick Devotions</hi> rightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, as we are continually put in mind of all things neceſſary for us to know or do, ſo that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways done by the ſame Words and Expreſſions, which by their conſtant uſe will imprint the things themſelves ſo firmly in our Minds, that it will be no eaſy matter to obliterate or raze them out; but do what we can they will ſtill occur upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; which cannot but be very much for our <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Edification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MOREOVER, That which conduceth to the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our Souls, and to the raiſing up our Affections in our publick Devotions, muſt needs be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to conduce much to our <hi>Edification.</hi> But it is plain, That as to ſuch purpoſes, a Set Form of Prayer is an extraordinary help to us; for if I hear another Pray, and know not before-hand what he will ſay, I muſt firſt liſten to what he will ſay next; then I am to conſider, whether what he ſaith be agreeable to ſound Doctrine, and whether it be proper and lawful for me to joyn with him in the Petitions he puts up to God Almighty; and if I think it is ſo, then I am to do it. But before I can well do that, he is got to another thing: By which means it is very difficult, if not morally impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to joyn with him in every thing ſo regularly as I ought to do. But by a <hi>Set Form of Prayer</hi> all this trouble is prevented; for having the Form con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in my mind, being throughly acquainted with it, fully approving of every thing in it, and always knowing before hand what will come next, I have nothing elſe to do, whilſt the Words are ſounding in mine Ears, but to move my Heart and Affections ſuitably to them, to raiſe up my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of thoſe good things which are prayed for, to fix my mind wholly upon God, whilſt I am praiſing of him, and ſo to employ, quicken, and lift up my whole Soul in performing my Devotions
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003624_0014_1002357D4B53A0B0"/>
to him. No Man that hath been accuſtomed to a <hi>Set Form</hi> for any conſiderable time, but may eaſily find this to be true by his own Experience: And by conſequence, that this way of Praying is a greater help to us, than they can imagine that never made tryal of it.</p>
            <p>To this may be alſo added, That if we hear another praying a Prayer of his own private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or voluntary Effuſion, our Minds are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound up and confined to his Words and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and to his Requeſts and Petitions, be they what they will: ſo that at the beſt we can but pray his Prayer. Whereas when we pray by a <hi>Form</hi> preſcribed by the Church, we pray the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the whole Church we live in, which are common to the Miniſter and People, to our ſelves, and to all the Members of the ſame Church: So that we have all the devout and pious Souls that are in it, concurring and joining with us in them: which cannot ſurely but be more effectual for the <hi>Edifying</hi> not only of our ſelves in particular, but of the Church in general, than any private Prayer can be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> IN order to our being <hi>edified</hi> by our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Devotions, as it is neceſſary that we know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand what we are to pray for, ſo it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that we afterwards know what we have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, when we have done: For I ſuppoſe you will all grant, that all the good and benefit we can receive from our Prayers, is to be ultimately reſolved into God's gracious hearing, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them: Without which they will all come to nothing.</p>
            <p>BUT there are two things required to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Anſwer of our Prayers:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:003624_0015_1002356E1BD32B40"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> THAT we ſincerely and earneſtly deſire good things at the Hands of God, to which, as I have ſhewn, a <hi>Set Form of Prayer</hi> couduceth very much:</p>
            <p>AND then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> IT is required alſo, that we truſt and depend up on God for his granting of them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Promiſes which he hath made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> And I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that one great Reaſon why Men pray ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to no purpoſe, is, becauſe they do not take this courſe: But when they have done their Prayers, they have done with them, and concern themſelves no more about them, than as if they had never prayed at all. But how can we expect that God ſhould anſwer our Prayers when we our ſelves do not mind whether he anſwers them or no? Nor believe and truſt upon him for it? For certainly truſting in God, as it is one of the higheſt Acts of Religion that we can perform, ſo it is that which gives Life and Vigour, Vertue and Efficacy to our Prayers, without which we have no ground at all to expect they ſhould be anſwered: For God hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing promiſed to anſwer our Prayers, except we truſt on him for his performance of ſuch Promiſes, we loſe the Benefit of them, and by conſequence our Prayers too. And therefore, as ever we deſire that he ſhould grant us what we pray for, when we have <hi>directed our Prayers to him,</hi> we muſt ſtill <hi>look up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pſal.</hi> 5.3. expecting and hoping for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of them.</p>
            <p>NOW as this is a thing of greater conſequence, ſo a <hi>Set Form of Prayer</hi> is a greater help to us in it, than it is commonly thought to be. For if we hear another utter a Prayer <hi>ex tempore,</hi> which he
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003624_0016_1002357ED847C648"/>
never ſaid, nor we heard before, nor ever ſhall do it again, it is much if he himſelf can remember the tenth part of what he ſaid: How much leſs can we that heard him, do it? And if we cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly remember what we prayed for, How is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for us to expect it at the Hands of God? or to depend upon him for it? But now it is quite otherwiſe when we uſe a <hi>Set Form of Prayer</hi>: For by this means, when we have prayed, we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect our ſelves, look over our Prayers again, either in a Book, or in our Minds, where they are im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>printed; we can conſider diſtinctly what we have asked at the Hands of God, and ſo act our Faith and Confidence on him, for the granting every Petition we have put up unto him, according to the Promiſes which he hath made us to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And as this is the ſureſt way whereby to obtain what we pray for, it muſt needs be the moſt <hi>Edifying</hi> way of Praying that we can poſſibly uſe.</p>
            <p>THESE Things being duly weighed, I ſhall now take it for granted, That the uſing a <hi>Form</hi> in <hi>general</hi> in the <hi>publick Worſhip</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> is agreeable to this Apoſtolical Rule, <hi>Let all Things be done to Edifying</hi>; and ſo ſhall proceed to ſhew, That that <hi>Form</hi> in particular, which <hi>our Church</hi> hath appointed to be uſed upon ſuch Occaſions, is ſo too. For which end it is not neceſſary that I ſhould run through every particular Word, Phraſe or Expreſſion in the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> much leſs that I ſhould vindicate and defend it from every little Exception, that Ignorance and Malice may make againſt ſomething in it. For nothing ever yet was, or can be ſaid or written but ſomething or other may be ſaid or written againſt it, either well or ill. But my Buſineſs muſt be to prove, That the <hi>Form of Divine Service</hi> contained in the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> which is now uſed in the Church

of <hi>England,</hi> conduceth ſo much to the <hi>Edifying</hi> thoſe that uſe it, that it agrees exactly to the Rule which the Apoſtle here preſcribes in that caſe. And this I ſhall demonſtrate from four Heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>From the Language.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>From the Matter, or Subſtance of it.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>From the Method.</hi> And,</item>
               <item>4. <hi>From the Manner of Performing it.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>FOR if it be <hi>Edifying</hi> in all theſe Reſpects, it muſt needs be acknowledged to be ſo in the whole. There being nothing in it but what may be reduced to ſome of theſe Heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> THEREFORE as to the <hi>Language,</hi> you all know that the whole Service is performed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> the Vulgar and the common Language of the Nation, which every one underſtands, and ſo may be <hi>Edified</hi> by it. And this, indeed, is the Ground and Foundation of all the Benefits that we can poſſibly receive from our publick Prayers. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the common People are made uncapable of being <hi>Edified</hi> by the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church, in that they are all made in <hi>Latin,</hi> a Language which they do not underſtand. So that when they meet to worſhip God, there are ſeldom any in the Congregation that knows what is ſaid there, except the Prieſt that reads it, and oftentimes not he neither. By which means they have no ſuch thing really amongſt them as <hi>Common-Prayer.</hi> Neither is it poſſible for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People to be ever <hi>Edified</hi> by what is there ſaid, or done, except they could be once convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by it of the horrible abuſe which their Church puts upon them; in commanding all her publick
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003624_0018_1002358063728DF0"/>
Devotions to be performed in an unknown Tongue, directly contrary not only to the Rule in my Text, but to the Deſign of this whole Chapter.</p>
            <p>BUT bleſſed be God for it, it is not ſo with us. For ours is truly <hi>Common-Prayer</hi>; for it is written and read in that Language which is <hi>common</hi> to all the Congregations in the Kingdom, and to every Perſon in each Congregation. So that all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Land, whatſoever Rank or Condition they are of may joyn together in the uſe of every thing that is in it, and ſo be jointly <hi>Edified</hi> by it: Eſpecially, conſidering that it is not only all in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but in <hi>common</hi> and <hi>plain Engliſh,</hi> ſuch as we uſe in our common Diſcourſe with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There are no unuſual or obſolete Words, no hard or uncouth. Phraſes in it, but every thing is expreſſed as clearly and plainly as Words can do it. So that the meaneſt Perſon in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, that underſtands but his Mother-Tongue, may be <hi>Edified</hi> by it, as well as the greateſt Scholar.</p>
            <p>BUT that which is chiefly to be conſidered in the Language of the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> is, that it is not only <hi>common</hi> but <hi>proper</hi> too. Though the Words there uſed are but common Words, yet they are ſo uſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they <hi>properly</hi> expreſs the things that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by them. This, I confeſs, may ſeem to be no great matter at firſt ſight, yet it is that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we might be ſubverted, by that which was intended for our <hi>Edification.</hi> For impropriety of Speech in Matters of Religion, hath given oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>moſt</hi> of the Schiſms, Errors and Hereſies, that ever infeſted this, or any other Church, as might eaſily be demonſtrated. Hence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle gave <hi>Timothy, A Form of ſound Words,</hi> and charged him to hold it faſt: <hi>Hold faſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Form of ſound Words which thou haſt heard of me,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.13. As knowing that except the
<pb n="14"
                   facs="unknown:003624_0019_10023581F5FF8838"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
Words, whereby he uſually expreſſed Divine Truths, were ſound and proper, it would be impoſſible for his Notions and Opinions of the Things themſelves to be ſo. And certainly, if ever there was <hi>A Form of ſound Words,</hi> compoſed by Men ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times, our <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> may juſtly deſerve that Title; it being all made up of ſuch fit and proper, ſuch ſound and wholſome Words, and if we do but hold faſt to them, there is no fear of our falling, either into Hereſie, or Schiſm. For they being duly conſidered, will ſuggeſt to our Minds, right and true Apprehenſions of all the Articles of our Chriſtian Religion, and ſo not only make us ſound, but build us up ſtrong and firm in our moſt Holy Faith: So that conſidering the plainneſs and perſpicuity, the ſoundneſs and propriety of Speech which is uſed in it, the leaſt that can be ſaid of the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> is, that all Things in it are ſo worded, as is moſt for the <hi>Edifying</hi> of all thoſe that uſe it.</p>
            <p>AND as the Words in the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> are all as <hi>Edifying</hi> as Words can be, ſo in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, is the <hi>Matter</hi> expreſſed by thoſe Words. For there is nothing in it, but what is neceſſary for our <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> and all things that are, or can be for our <hi>Edification,</hi> are plainly in it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſay there is nothing in our <hi>Liturgy</hi> but what is neceſſary for our <hi>Edification.</hi> There are no ſuch <hi>Fables</hi> in it, or <hi>End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Genealogies,</hi> which (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Queſtions, rather than Godly Edifying, which is in Faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.4. There are none of thoſe vain Diſputations, and impertinent Controverſies, which have of late been raiſed in the Church, to its great Diſturbance, rather than its <hi>Edification.</hi> There are no new Opinions, nor airy Speculations in it, which ſerve only to tickle Mens Ears, and pleaſe their Fancies, and ſo divert their Thoughts from what they are about. Look it all over without Prejudice

and Partiality, conſider ſeriouſly every thing that is in it, and you will find nothing aſſerted, but what is conſonant to God's Word, nothing prayed for, but according to his Promiſe, nothing required as a Duty, but what is agreeable to his Commands, nothing ſaid or done, but what is grave and ſober, ſolemn and ſubſtantial; nothing but what becomes the Worſhip of our Great and Almighty Creator. And therefore, nothing but what we may ſome way or other be <hi>Edified</hi> by it.</p>
            <p>AND as there is nothing in it, but what is <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,</hi> ſo all Things that are or can be <hi>Edifying,</hi> are in it. For nothing can be neceſſary to <hi>Edifie,</hi> and make us ſolid and perfect Chriſtians, but what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary either to be <hi>believed,</hi> or <hi>done,</hi> or elſe <hi>obtained</hi> by us. But there is nothing neceſſary to be <hi>known</hi> or <hi>believed,</hi> but we are taught it; nothing neceſſary to be <hi>done,</hi> but we are enjoined in it; nothing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be <hi>obtained,</hi> but we pray for it in our <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Form</hi> of <hi>Divine Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR firſt, As to thoſe things which are neceſſary to be <hi>known,</hi> or <hi>believed,</hi> it is acknowledged by all <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that they are fully contained in the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures,</hi> which make a great, if not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of our <hi>Divine Service</hi>; and are conſtantly read over, the <hi>Pſalms</hi> once every <hi>Month</hi> the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> once, and the <hi>New</hi> thrice every <hi>Year.</hi> And all the Fundamental Articles of our Chriſtian Faith, revealed in the Holy Scriptures, being briefly ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up in the <hi>Apoſtles Creed</hi>; that we may be ſure to keep them always in our Minds, we have that <hi>Creed</hi> read, and repeated always once, and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly twice every day in the <hi>Year.</hi> And ſeeing the Godhead of our Bleſſed Saviour, the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our whole Religion, hath been, and ſtill is denied by ſome, left we ſhould be led away with the Error of the Wicked, every Sunday and Holy-day
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003624_0021_1002358487B674F0"/>
we read the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> wherein the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, both of the Son and Holy Ghoſt, is aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and explained. And that we may not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any Erroneous Opinions concerning the moſt Holy Trinity, or the Incarnation of the Son of God, but the true Catholick Faith whole, and undefiled, upon certain days every Year, we read that which is commonly called, <hi>The Creed of St.</hi> Athanaſius, wherein thoſe great Myſteries are unfolded, in the moſt proper and perſpicuous terms that they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of.</p>
            <p>AND as all things neceſſary to be believed, are ſummarily contained in the <hi>Three Creeds,</hi> ſo they are frequently explained in the other parts of our <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi>; Inſomuch, that it would be eaſy to frame a <hi>compleat Body of Divinity</hi> out of the Words there u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: At leaſt of all ſuch things as are needful for any Man in the World to believe or know, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his <hi>Eternal Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſame may be ſaid alſo of all thoſe things which we ought to do: For, as we here do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is neceſſary to be done, in order to our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God in this place, ſo we here are taught whatſoever is neceſſary to be learnt, in order to our ſerving God in all other places. So that no Man that frequents our publick Congregations, where the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> is uſed, can ever plead Ignorance of any one Duty whatſoever: For if it be not his own Fault, he may there be inſtructed in every thing which he that made him requires of him. For here, as I obſerved before, we conſtantly read the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, which as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Righteouſneſs, that the Man of God may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, throughly inſtructed unto all good Works,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16, 17. And ſeeing it hath pleaſed the Moſt High God to compriſe his whole Will, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003624_0022_100235A796F0C998"/>
our Duty, in the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> hence we read them conſtantly every Sunday and Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day throughout the whole Year: By which means every one, that doth not wilfully ſhut his Eyes, may clearly ſee, and fully underſtand, his whole Duty, both to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi> Eſpecially conſidering that in your Prayers themſelves alſo, there is frequent mention made of all thoſe Vices which ought to be avoided, and of all thoſe good Works which ought to be performed by us. So that we can never come to Church, but we are ſtill put in mind, both of <hi>what we ought,</hi> and <hi>what we ought not</hi> to do, that we may be ſaved.</p>
            <p>AND then, as there is nothing neceſſary to be <hi>known,</hi> or <hi>done,</hi> but we are taught it; ſo neither is there any thing neceſſary to be <hi>obtained,</hi> to make us either Holy, or Happy, but we pray for it in the <hi>Common-Prayer.</hi> For here we have the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> a Prayer compoſed by Wiſdom it ſelf; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs be the moſt perfect and Divine Prayer that ever was made. Neither do we uſe it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly once, but in every diſtinct Service of the Church, in our Prayers before we read the Holy Scripture, and in our Prayers after; towards the end of the <hi>Litany,</hi> and in the beginning of the <hi>Communion</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and in every Office of the Church beſides. And the reaſon is, becauſe although our Saviour hath not forbidden us to uſe any other Prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet he hath expreſly commanded us to ſay this, whenſoever we pray. And therefore, in obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, our Church hath wiſely ordered, that in all, and in every Solemn Addreſs that we make to the moſt High God, we always ſay this Prayer, leſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, by our Tranſgreſſion of his Command, in omitting this, we make all our other Prayers to be ineffectual. And beſides, by the conſtant uſe of this amongſt our other Prayers, we are always ſure to uſe one Prayer, both abſolutely perfect in it ſelf, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003624_0023_100235879B088C28"/>
moſt acceptable unto him, to whom we pray; it being a Prayer of his own Compoſure: So that we ſpeak unto God in his own Words, and ſo may be confident, that we ask nothing of him, but exactly according to his own Will.</p>
            <p>AND though all things neceſſary for us be vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually contained in the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> yet our Church, in Conformity to the Catholick and Apoſtolical, hath thought good to add ſome other Prayers, in which the ſame things are more particularly expreſſed and deſired, at the hands of our great and moſt boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Benefactor. All which are ſo contrived, that there is nothing Evil, or Hurtful for us, but we pray againſt it; nothing Good, or Uſeful, but we pray for it. There is no Vice, or Luſt, but we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it may be ſubdued under us: No Grace or Vertue, but we pray it may be planted and grow in us. Inſomuch, that if we do but conſtantly and ſincerely pray over all thoſe Prayers, and ſtedfaſtly believe and truſt in God for his anſwering of them, and ſo obtain what we there pray for, we cannot but be as real and true Saints, as happy and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Creatures, as it is poſſible for us to be in this World. Neither do we here pray for our ſelves only, but according to the Apoſtle's Advice, we make <hi>Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and giving of Thanks for all Men</hi>; yea, <hi>for our very Enemies,</hi> as our Saviour hath commanded us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. And what can be deſired more than all this, to make the Matter of the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> Edifying, either to our ſelves or others? Nothing certainly, but Truth and Sincerity of Heart in the uſing of it.</p>
            <p>I cannot paſs from this Head, before I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved one thing more unto you, concerning the Prayers in general, and that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That they are not carried on in one continued Diſcourſe, but divided into many ſhort Prayers, or Collects, ſuch as that
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003624_0024_100235A9F4B4C858"/>
is, which our Lord himſelf compoſed; and that might be one Reaſon, wherefore our Church ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, that ſo ſhe might follow our Lord's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in it, who beſt knew what kind of Prayers were fitteſt for us to uſe. And indeed, we cannot but all find, by our own Experience, how difficult it is to keep our Minds long intent upon any thing, much more upon ſo great things as the Object and Subject of our Prayers are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but do what we can, we are ſtill liable to Diſtractions: So that there is a kind of neceſſity to break off ſometimes, to give our ſelves a breathing time, that our Thoughts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loofned for a while, they may with more eaſe, and leſs Danger of Diſtraction, be tied up again, as it is neceſſary they ſhould be, all the while that we are actually praying to the Supreme Being of the World.</p>
            <p>BESIDES that, in order to the performing our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions aright to the moſt High God, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that our Souls be poſſeſſed all along with due Apprehenſions of his Greatneſs and Glory. To which purpoſe our ſhort Prayers contribute very much: For every one of them beginning with ſome of the Properties or Perfections of God, and ſo ſuggeſting to our Minds right Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of him at firſt, it is eaſy to preſerve them in our Minds during the ſpace of a ſhort Prayer, which in a long one would be apt to ſcatter and vaniſh away.</p>
            <p>BUT that which I look upon as one of the principal Reaſons, why our <hi>publick Devotions</hi> are, and ſhould be divided into ſhort Collects is this: Our Bleſſed Saviour, we know, hath often told us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That whatſoever we ask in his Name, we ſhall receive: And ſo hath directed us in all our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to make uſe of his Name, and to ask nothing but upon the Account of his Merit and Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="20"
                   facs="unknown:003624_0025_1002358927B01860"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
for us; upon which all our Hopes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from God do wholly and ſolely depend. Hence therefore, (as it always was, ſo) it cannot but be judged neceſſary, that the Name of Chriſt be frequently inſerted in our Prayers, that ſo we may lift up our Hearts unto him, and act our Faith upon him for our obtaining the good things we pray for. And ſo we ſee it is in the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> for whatſoever it is we ask of God, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently add, <hi>Through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to that purpoſe. And ſo ask nothing but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Lord's Direction, even in his Name. And this is the reaſon that ma<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> our Prayers ſo ſhort: for take away the Concluſion of every Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or Prayer, <hi>In the Name of Chriſt,</hi> and you may join them all together, and make them but as one continued Prayer. But this would be to offer manifeſt Violence to the Prayers, by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that which gives them all their Force and Energy, and ſo making them ineffectual to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes for which they are uſed. For certainly the asking all things in the Name of Chriſt, as we do in the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> is the only way whereby to obtain what we deſire, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the moſt <hi>Edifying Way</hi> of Praying in the World.</p>
            <p>THE next thing to be conſidered in the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> is the <hi>Method,</hi> which is admirable, and as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying,</hi> if poſſible, as the <hi>Matter</hi> it ſelf. This none can deny, that doth but fully underſtand, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider of it. Which therefore, that you may all do, I ſhall briefly run through the whole, and give you what Light I can into it, that you may clearly ſee, not only the Reaſonableneſs, but the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of it all along.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:003624_0026_100235AC4A237198"/>FOR which purpoſe I ſhall inſtance only in ſuch things which offer themſelves at firſt ſight, to any one that doth but caſt his Eye upon it.</p>
            <p>LET us therefore ſuppoſe a Congregation of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and devout Chriſtians (ſuch as we all ſhould be) met together to perform their publick Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Almighty God; every one of which hath lift up his Heart privately unto him already, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring his Aid and Aſſiſtance in the Performance of ſo great a Work, and ſo are all now ready to ſet about it.</p>
            <p>THE firſt thing we do, is to Read ſome <hi>Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of Holy Scripture, that ſo we may begin our Devotions unto God in his own Words. And they are all ſuch <hi>Sentences</hi> as put us in mind of our ſins againſt him, and of his promiſe to pardon them if we do repent: That ſo we may preſent and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry our ſelves with that Reverence and Godly Fear before him, as becometh thoſe who are ſenſible of their own Vileneſs and Unworthineſs to approach ſo great a Majeſty: And likewiſe, with that Faith and humble Confidence, which becometh thoſe who believe, that he upon our Repentance will pardon our Sins, and accept both our Perſons and Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, according to the Promiſes which he hath made unto us.</p>
            <p>THEN follows a grave <hi>Exhortation,</hi> concerning the end of our preſent Aſſembling, which is of great Uſe, and ought never to be omitted. For Men generally are apt to ruſh into the Preſence of God, without ever conſidering what they go about Whereas, this <hi>Exhortation</hi> puts us upon conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greatneſs of the Work which we are now ingaged in, and ſo upon compoſing our Thoughts,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003624_0027_1002358AF328AA18"/>
and preparing our ſelves for the due performance of it.</p>
            <p>OUR Minds being thus brought into a right Frame and Temper for it, we all, both Miniſter and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, proſtrate our ſelves before the moſt high God, <hi>Confeſſing</hi> upon our Knees, the manifold Sins and Wickedneſs that we have committed againſt him. Which <hi>Confeſſion</hi> is ſo contrived, that all, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Perſon in any Congregation whatſoever, may join in it. For it runs in general Terms: And yet ſo too, that every particular Perſon may and ought in his own mind to confeſs and acknowledge his own Sins, which he knows himſelf to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of. As where we ſay, <hi>We have left undone thoſe things which we ought to have done, and we have done thoſe things which we ought not to have done.</hi> At the ſaying of this every one ſhould call his own Sins to remembrance, and what Duties he knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have omitted, and what Vices he knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have committed, and confeſs them according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto God. And when we have thus confeſſed our Sins to God, we preſently implore his Mercy in the pardon of them, and his Grace, that for the future we may forſake them.</p>
            <p>AND whilſt we are thus upon our Knees, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly confeſſing and bewailing our Sins before the Lord our God, the Miniſter ſtands up, and in the Name of God, declares and pronounceth to all thoſe who truly repent, and unfeignedly believe his Goſpel, <hi>The Abſolution and Remiſſion of all their Sins</hi> Which though ſpoken alſo in general Terms, yet every particular Perſon there preſent, ought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to himſelf, ſo as to be fully perſuaded in his own mind, that if he doth but ſincerely repent, and believe the Goſpel, he is perfectly abſolved from all his Sins by God himſelf, according to the Promiſes
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003624_0028_100235ADD6444588"/>
which he hath made to Mankind in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now looking upon our ſelves as <hi>abſolved</hi> from our Sins, upon our Repentance and Faith in Chriſt, and by conſequence, as reconciled to God, we take the boldneſs to call him Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> humbly addreſſing our ſelves to him in that <hi>Divine Form</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> which he himſelf hath given us. Which done, we lift up our Hearts and Voices unto God, for his Aſſiſtance of us in what we do, in the words of <hi>David,</hi> the Miniſter crying out, <hi>O Lord, open thou our Lips,</hi> and the People anſwering, <hi>And our Mouths ſhall ſhew forth thy Praiſe.</hi> The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter again, <hi>O God make ſpeed to ſave us,</hi> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>O Lord, make haſt to help us.</hi> And them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately we all lift up our Bodies to ſtand upon our Feet, and ſo put our ſelves into a poſture of Praiſing and Magnifying the Eternal God, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Holy Ghoſt, for his infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mercy towards us; for which purpoſe the Miniſter firſt ſaith, or ſings, the <hi>Gloria Patri, Glory be, to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghoſt</hi>; and the People to ſhew their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, anſwer, <hi>As it was in the Beginning, is now, and ever ſhall be: World without end.</hi> Amen. But not thinking this to be enough, the Miniſter calls upon the People again, ſaying, <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord,</hi> and the People anſwer, <hi>The Lord's Name be praiſed</hi>; and then we go on to praiſe him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſaying, or ſinging, the Ninety-fifth <hi>Pſalm, Venite exultemus Domino, O come let us ſing unto the Lord, let us heartily rejoice in the ſtrength of our Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo proceed to the <hi>Pſalm</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Day. After every one of which, to teſtify our Belief in the moſt Sacred Trinity, and our acknowledgment of that infinite Love and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003624_0029_1002358E98DE2660"/>
Goodneſs, which every one of thoſe Divine Perſons hath manifeſted to us, we repeat that incomparable Hymn, <hi>Glory be to the Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>OUR Hearts being thus raiſed up to God in praiſing and admiring of him, we are now in a fit Temper and Diſpoſition to hear what he ſhall ſpeak unto us. And therefore have a Chapter read out of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi>; and that in its ordinary courſe, except upon Sundays and Holydays, when more people attending the publick Worſhip of God, than can conveniently come upon other days, we read ſome ſelect Chapter proper for the day, and ſuch as is judged moſt <hi>edifying</hi> to all that are there preſent. And having thus heard God ſpeaking unto us in his Holy Word, we preſently fall upon prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of him again, for ſo unſpeakable a Mercy, ſaying, or ſinging in the Morning, the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> one of the moſt Heavenly and Seraphick Hymns that was ever compoſed by Men: Or elſe, the <hi>Song of the three Children,</hi> which is nothing but a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe upon that which <hi>David</hi> ſang ſo often upon Earth, and which the Holy Angels ſing continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Heaven, even <hi>Hallelujah, Praiſe ye the Lord.</hi> Wherein we being all ſenſible how far ſhort we our ſelves come of praiſing God ſufficiently, we call upon all the Creatures of the World to do it, <hi>Bleſs ye the Lord, praiſe him and magnifie him for ever.</hi> In the Afternoon, we ſing either the <hi>Magnificat,</hi> or elſe the Ninety eighth <hi>Pſalm,</hi> both which being taken out of God's own Word, cannot but be very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and acceptable unto him.</p>
            <p>AFTER this, our Soul being got upon the Wing again, and ſoaring aloft in the Contemplation of the Divine Perfections, we are now rightly qualified to hear and receive the Sublime Myſteries of the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi> And therefore have a Chapter read to us out of the <hi>New-Teſtament.</hi> After which, we being revived
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003624_0030_100235AF73434A80"/>
with the good tidings of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and filled with admiration at the infinite Goodneſs of God therein revealed to us, we break forth again into Praiſing and Adoring of him, in the Song of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> or elſe the hundredth <hi>Pſalm,</hi> in the Morning; and at Evening, either the Sixty ſeventh <hi>Pſalm,</hi> or elſe the Song of <hi>Old Simeon,</hi> ſtill concluding with <hi>Gloria Patri.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW having thus heard ſome part of the Word of God read to us, and expreſſed our Thankfulneſs unto him for it, to ſignify our Aſſent, not only to what we have heard, but to the whole Scripture, we all with one Heart and Voice repeat the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> wherein the Sum and Subſtance of it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. And ſo profeſs our ſelves to continue in the number of Chriſt's Diſciples, and that as we were at firſt Baptized, ſo we ſtill believe in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, <hi>God</hi> Bleſſed for evermore.</p>
            <p>HITHERTO we have been moſtly taken up with Confeſſing our Sins to <hi>God,</hi> imploring his Mercy in the Pardon of them, hearing his moſt Holy Word, acknowledging his Goodneſs to us, and praiſing and magnifying his Name for it. By which means, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we have been extreamly wanting to our ſelves, our Hearts cannot but be ſo united and fixed upon <hi>God,</hi> that we are now rightly diſpoſed to make known our Wants, and preſent our Petitions before him. This therefore is the next thing we ſet upon: But ſeeing that neither Miniſter nor People can poſſibly do it aright, without the Aſſiſtance of <hi>God</hi> himſelf, therefore each of them firſt pray for his ſpecial Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with the other. The one ſaying, <hi>The Lord be with you,</hi> the other, <hi>And with thy Spirit.</hi> And then immediately falling down upon our Knees, we A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore and Supplicate each Perſon of the moſt Bleſſed Trinity to have mercy upon us, <hi>Lord have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003624_0031_10023590E9F67A38"/>
us, Chriſt have mercy upon us, Lord have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</hi> After which we Addreſs our ſelves to <hi>God</hi> in the Words that he hath put into our Mouths, ſaying the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Prayer</hi>; which ended, the Miniſter and People, by turns lift up their Hearts to <hi>God</hi> in ſome ſhort and heavenly Ejaculations, ſtriving as it were to out-vye each other in prevailing with the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to pour down his Bleſſings upon us. And then, in an humble and ſolemn manner, we join together in ſupplicating his Divine Majeſty for his Grace and Favour, his Defence and Protection, his Mercy, and Bleſſing, for our <hi>ſelves,</hi> for the <hi>King,</hi> for the <hi>Royal Family,</hi> for his <hi>Church,</hi> and for all <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND thus we do ordinarily in the Collects appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>BUT upon <hi>Wedneſdays</hi> and <hi>Fridays</hi> (upon which days the Primitive Church uſed to perform their more than ordinary Devotions) as alſo upon the <hi>Lord's-Day</hi> in the Morning, we do it in the <hi>Litany,</hi> and in ſuch a <hi>Litany</hi> as comprehends all, and every thing that we can ever need to deſire of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> either for our ſelves or others.</p>
            <p>AFTER this, upon Sundays and Holy-days, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the <hi>Communion-Service</hi>: And therefore, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to the Lord's Table, we begin it with his own Prayer. And after another ſhort Prayer to <hi>God</hi> to cleanſe the Thoughts of our Hearts by the Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Holy Spirit, we read the <hi>Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which he hath enjoyn'd us to obſerve; and after every Commandment we ask <hi>God</hi> Mercy for our Tranſgreſſion thereof, for the time paſt, and Grace to keep the ſame for the time to come; ſaying, <hi>Lord have Mercy upon us, and incline our Hearts to keep this Law.</hi> And then, after a Prayer for the <hi>King,</hi> and the Collect for the day, we read the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003624_0032_100235B28ABFF7E8"/>
               <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that is, moſt commonly, a ſhort Paragraph taken out of the Canonical <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> and another out of one of the Holy <hi>Goſpels,</hi> which was the antient way of reading the Scripture, before it was divided into Chapters And we do it now to prepare us the better for the <hi>Communion</hi> of the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> therein revealed to us. But ſeeing we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do, nor can read over the whole, we repeat the ſubſtance of it in the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> which it is very neceſſary we ſhould do at this time, that ſo we may demonſtrate our ſelves to be Chriſtians, and ſo capable of receiving the moſt holy <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that all this while hath employed himſelf as he ought to do in the Service of our Church, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but find himſelf ſtrangely <hi>edified</hi> by it. Yet howſoever, that nothing may be wanting that may any way conduce to our <hi>Edification,</hi> after the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> our Church hath appointed a <hi>Sermon</hi> to be Preached, which if ſound, plain and practical, as it ought to be, cannot but be very <hi>edifying</hi> too.</p>
            <p>And now we may be well ſuppoſed to be ſo far <hi>Edified,</hi> as to be raiſed up to the higheſt pitch of Devotion that we can arrive at in this World, and ſo are fit to be admitted to the <hi>higheſt Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi> And therefore we now betake our ſelves to it. But that we may not appear before our Lord empty, we firſt offer up ſomething to him of what he hath beſtowed upon us, to be diſpoſ'd of to Pious and Charitable Uſes; teſtifying thereby our acknowledgment of his Goodneſs to us, and that we have nothing but what we receive from him. And to excite and encourage us to do this, all the while that we are offering, we have ſome ſelect Sentences of Scripture read to us, wherein God either commands us to be Charitable, or elſe
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003624_0033_100235929AF5D718"/>
promiſeth a Bleſſing to thoſe that are ſo. And then we pray <hi>for Chriſt's whole Church Militant here on Earth,</hi> whereby we profeſs our ſelves to be real Members of it, and deſirous to hold Communion with it in Chriſt's Myſtical Body and Blood. And ſo we proceed to the celebration of it; in which the <hi>Method</hi> is ſo clear, ſo apparently <hi>Edifying,</hi> that I need not ſay any thing of it. But ſhall only obſerve <hi>two</hi> things in General concerning it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> THAT the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> being the higheſt Myſtery in all our Religion, as Repreſenting the Death of the Son of God to us, hence that place where the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, was always made and reputed the higheſt place in the Church. And therefore alſo it was wont to be ſeparated from the reſt of the Church by a Skreen or Partition of Net-work, in Latin <hi>Cancelli,</hi> and that ſo generally, that from thence the place it ſelf is called the <hi>Chancel.</hi> That this was antiently obſerved in the Building of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Churches (for I ſpeak not of private Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories or Chapels) within few Centuries after the Apoſtles themſelves, even in the days of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, as well as in all Ages ſince, I could eaſily demonſtrate from the Records of thoſe Times. But having purpoſely waved Antiquity hitherto, I am loath to trouble you with it now. But I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it at preſent, only becauſe ſome perhaps may wonder why this ſhould be obſerved in our Church, rather than in all the other Churches which have been lately built in this City, Whereas they ſhould rather wonder, why it was not obſerved in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as well as this. For beſides our Obligations to conform as much as may be to the Practice of the Univerſal Church, and to avoid Novelty and Singularity in all things relating to the Worſhip of God, it cannot be eaſily imagin'd, that the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> in all Ages and Places for 13 or
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003624_0034_100235B419292980"/>
1400 Years together, ſhould obſerve ſuch a Cuſtom as this, except there were great Reaſons for it.</p>
            <p>WHAT they were, it is not neceſſary for us to enquire now. It may be ſufficient to obſerve at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that the <hi>Chancel</hi> in our Chriſtian Churches was always looked upon, as anſwerable to the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> in the Temple, which, you know, was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Sanctuary or Body of the Temple, by the Command of God himſelf. And that this place being appropriated to the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> it ought to be contrived, as may be moſt convenient for thoſe who are to partake of that Bleſſed Ordinance. But it muſt needs be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for thoſe who are to enjoy <hi>Communion</hi> with Chriſt, and in him with one another, in this <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> to meet together, as one Body, in one Place, ſeparated for that purpoſe, than to be diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as otherwiſe they would be, ſome in one and ſome in another part of the Church. Or in ſhort, it is much better for the place to be ſeparate, than the People.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, IT is not only convenient, but in ſome Senſe neceſſary, for every <hi>Communicant</hi> to obſerve and take ſpecial Notice of the ſeveral Circumſtances which our Lord hath ordained to be uſed in this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as the Breaking of the Bread, and the Conſecrating both that and the Wine, to repreſent his Death, the breaking of his Body, and the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his Blood for our Sins; that ſo our Hearts may be the more affected with it, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence our Souls more <hi>Edified</hi> by it. But this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo well done, except there be a place ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for it, where they may all be placed, about or near the <hi>Communion Table,</hi> and ſo behold what is there done at the Conſecration of the Elements. Hence alſo it is, that the Seats there, are and ought o be ſo ordered, that all that are in them may ſtill

                   facs="unknown:003624_0035_100235942B09DA50"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
look that way, and contemplate upon their Bleſſed Saviour, there evidently ſet forth as crucified for them.</p>
            <p>THE other thing that I would obſerve unto you concerning the <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> is this, that our Church requireth, or at leaſt ſuppoſeth it to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred every Lord's Day, and every Holy-day throughout the Year, as it was in the Primitive Church. For that is the Reaſon that the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Service</hi> is appointed to be uſed upon all ſuch Days, and to be read at the Communion Table, that ſo the Miniſter may be there ready to Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter it unto all that deſire to partake of it. Which ſhews the great Care that our Church hath of all her Members, that they might be <hi>edified</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed</hi> in the Faith; to which nothing contributes more, that <hi>frequent Communion</hi> at our Lord's Table. Which if People could once be perſuaded to, they would ſoon find greater Benefit by it than I can expreſs, or they themſelves, till then, imagine. I ſhall ſay no more of it at preſent, but only this, That I am ſo ſenſible of what I now ſay, that could I be ſure to have a ſufficient Number of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, I ſhould be heartily glad to Adminiſter the <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> every <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> both for their ſakes, and my own too.</p>
            <p>THUS I have given you a ſhort Scheme of that Excellent Method wherein our <hi>Divine Service</hi> is performed; which whoſover rightly conſiders, will need no other Argument to convince him, that it is, according to the Apoſtle's Rule, very <hi>Edifying</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. The laſt thing to be conſidered in it, is the Manner of its Performance; by which I mean only the ſeveral Poſtures of the Body, as <hi>ſtanding</hi> and <hi>kneeling,</hi> which are uſed in it: for they are alſo done to <hi>Edifying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:003624_0036_100235B6ABC0AB18"/>WHILE we ſay or ſing the <hi>Hymns</hi> or <hi>Pſalms</hi> to the Praiſe and Glory of God, we <hi>ſtand</hi> up, not only to ſignifie, but to excite the Elevation of our Minds at that time. For as on the one hand, if our Souls be really lift up in the Praiſes of God, our Bodies will naturally lift up themſelves, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them as far as they can towards Heaven; ſo on the other hand, the raiſing up of our Bodies helps towards the raiſing up of our Souls too, by putting us in mind of that High and Heavenly Work we are now about; wherein, according to our weak Capacities, we join with the Choir of Heaven in praiſing God now, as we hope to do it for evermore. For this Cauſe alſo we <hi>ſtand</hi> at the <hi>Creeds,</hi> for they being Confeſſions of our Faith in God, as ſuch they come under the proper Notions of Hymns, or Songs of Praiſe to him. All our praiſing God being really nothing elſe but our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing and acknowledging him to be what he is in himſelf and to us. And beſides that, by our <hi>ſtanding</hi> at the Creeds and Goſpels, we ſignifie our Aſſent unto them, and our readineſs to defend them to the utmoſt of our Power, againſt all Oppoſition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. And as for the Goſpels particularly, they contain the very Acts which our Lord did, and the very Words which he ſpake when he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth; and therefore we who profeſs him to be our Lord and Maſter, cannot ſurely but <hi>ſtand</hi> up, when we hear him ſpeaking, and liſten diligently to thoſe gracious Words which proceed out of his Divine Mouth.</p>
            <p>AND as when we praiſe God, we raiſe up our ſelves as high as we can towards Heaven, ſo when we pray unto him, we fall down as low as we can towards the Earth, not daring to preſent our Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to the abſolute Monarch of the whole World, any other ways than upon our <hi>Knees.</hi> Which
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:003624_0037_10023597157BE0C0"/>
is ſo proper, ſo natural a Poſture of Supplicants, that if all Men would but duly conſider what they do when they pray to Almighty God, the Church need never have commanded them to <hi>kneel</hi> at that time. For they could not chooſe but do it: No, not although the place where they are, ſhould ſeem never ſo inconvenient for it. For we find our bleſſed Saviour himſelf <hi>kneeling</hi> at his Prayer in the Garden, upon the <hi>bare Ground, Luk.</hi> 22.41. and St. <hi>Paul</hi> upon the <hi>Sea-ſhore,</hi> where he could have no other Cuſhion but <hi>Stones</hi> or <hi>Sand, Acts</hi> 21.5. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to take off all thoſe little Excuſes that Men are apt to make for themſelves in this caſe, the Seats in this Church are ſo diſpoſed, and all things ſo prepared in them, that there can be no Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience at all in it, but rather all the Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences for <hi>Kneeling</hi> that can be deſired. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any one of you ſhall neglect to <hi>kneel,</hi> while the Prayers are read, they will give us too much Cauſe to call their Religion into Queſtion, or to ſuſpect they have none at all. For if they had, they durſt not, they could not offer ſuch a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Affront to the great Creator of the World, as to carry themſelves no otherwiſe while they pray to him, than as if they were converſing with their Fellow Creatures. But why do I ſpeak of their praying unto God! It is too much to be feared they do not pray at all, nor come to Church for any better purpoſe, than only to ſee and be ſeen. I am ſure they perform no Act of external Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Adoration unto God, nor ſhew him that Reſpect and Reverence which is due unto him; and ſo give very great Offence to all pious and devout Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>WHEREAS if all and every Perſon in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation would always be upon their <hi>Knees,</hi> while they put up their Petitions to the moſt High God, what a mighty Advantage would this be, not only
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003624_0038_100235B914866118"/>
to every one in particular, but to the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation in general? For as every one would by this means keep his Heart more ſtedfaſt in the true Fear and Dread of God, and likewiſe more certainly obtain the good things he prays for, as the Fathers frequently aſſert, ſo the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo would be very much <hi>edified</hi> by it. For by this means we ſhould excite and inflame each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Devotions, confirm and ſtrengthen one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others Faith, and convince both our ſelves and all that ſee us, that Religion is indeed a ſerious thing; and that we believe it to be ſo, by our ſerving God with ſo much <hi>Reverence and godly Fear,</hi> as this humble Poſture repreſenteth. And therefore as you tender the Love of God, the Credit of Religion, or the Salvation of your own Souls, I beſeech you all, in the Name of him who made you, that whenſoever you come hither to pray unto him, you do it in that awful, lowly, and ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which our Church commandeth, and as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh Creatures, when you ſpeak to your Great and Almighty Creator; that ſo you may give true Worſhip and Honour unto him, and alſo receive that Benefit and <hi>Edification</hi> to your ſelves, which he hath promiſed, and you expect from your publick Prayers. This being certainly the moſt <hi>Edifying</hi> Poſture that you can poſſibly uſe upon ſuch Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>FROM what hath been hitherto diſcourſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Language,</hi> the <hi>Matter,</hi> the <hi>Method,</hi> and the <hi>Manner</hi> of performing <hi>Divine Service,</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and preſcribed in the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi>; we may poſitively conclude, that it agrees exactly with the Rule in my Text, even that <hi>All things in it are done to Edifying</hi>: Which was the Thing I undertook to prove. I know that many ther Arguments might be brought to ſhew the Excellency and Uſefulneſs of the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi>;
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003624_0039_1002359A2BDACE80"/>
but theſe already produced, are ſufficient to convince any ſober and conſidering Chriſtian of it. And if there be any here preſent, who are not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by what they have heard of it, I deſire only one thing of them, and that is, That they would make Tryal of it for a while For my Charity prompts me to believe, that all the Zeal that ſome expreſs againſt the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and all that Indifferency that is in others for it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds only from their Ignorance of what it is, or at leaſt from their want of an Experimental Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it. For let any Man that ſeriouſly minds the Worſhip of God, and the Salvation of his Soul, before all things elſe, let ſuch a one, I ſay, ſet himſelf in good earneſt to uſe the <hi>Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> as he ought to do, for ſome conſiderable time, and I not doubt but that by the bleſſing of God, he will find that benefit and <hi>Edification</hi> by it, that his own Experience ſhall convince him of all that I have now ſaid, more than all the Arguments that I have, or any Man in the World can ever produce to him. Some perhaps may think this to be a Paradox; but I do not queſtion but that many here preſent can atteſt it upon their own Knowledge; having found themſelves more confirmed in their Faith, more ſettled in their Religion, more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for their Sins, more ſupported under their Troubles, more inflam'd with Love to God and Deſires of Heaven, every way more <hi>Edifi'd</hi> by the conſtant uſe of the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> than they could ever have believed it poſſible to have been, except they had found it to have been ſo by their own Experience.</p>
            <p>NOW theſe things being thus briefly conſidered, I ſhall obſerve only two things from them.</p>
            <p>THE firſt is the extraordinary Prudence, as well as Piety, of our firſt Reformers, who firſt compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003624_0040_100235BB6E4CF760"/>
the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> ſo exactly confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the Word of God, and the Apoſtolical Canon in my Text; which I cannot but aſcribe to the ſame extraordinary aid and aſſiſtance from God, whereby they were afterward inabled to ſuffer <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,</hi> yea, <hi>Martyrdom</hi> it ſelf for his ſake, and ſo to confirm what they have done with their own <hi>Blood.</hi> Which certainly is no ſmall Commendation of it.</p>
            <p>The other thing I would obſerve unto you, is the Reaſon why the Devil hath had ſuch a Spight againſt the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> ever ſince it was firſt made. For the more <hi>Edifying</hi> it is to God's People, the more Deſtructive it muſt needs be of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's Kingdom. And therefore it is no wonder that he hath all along imployed the utmoſt of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Policy to blaſt its Reputation, and ſo to diſcourage and diſſuade Men from the uſe of it. And by the Permiſſion of God, for the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this ungrateful Nation, he hath ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in his Deſign, that the <hi>Liturgy</hi> hath been <hi>twice</hi> caſt out of the Church ſince it was firſt brought into it, once in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and then again in the Days of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> you all know, who were her Inſtruments in the doing of it, even the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> For they clearly and truly foreſaw that their Erroneous Opinions could never be believed, nor Superſtitious Practices obſerved in the Nation, ſo long as the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> was uſed. Foraſmuch as there is nothing in it but what is ſound and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and ſo contary to the groundleſs Opinions which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would obtrude upon the World for <hi>Articles of Faith.</hi> And beſides that, there are many Expreſſions purpoſely inſerted in it, to arm us againſt the <hi>Pope's
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:003624_0041_1002359BE338E050"/>
Supremacy, Indulgences, Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints, Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantion,</hi> and other <hi>Popiſh</hi> Errors; ſo that it would have been impoſſible for the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion to be ever reſtored in the Nation, unleſs the <hi>Common-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> was firſt removed. Which therefore they took care to have done as ſoon as poſſible. But within a few Years after, even the Firſt of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> it was brought in again. And as the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was begun before, ſo from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it was carried on and perfected chiefly by the means of <hi>Common-Prayer.</hi> For it is very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and for ſeveral Years too of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> there was little or no Preaching in moſt parts of the Kingdom, and few then could read <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and yet by the conſtant and general Uſe of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and God's Bleſſing upon it, the whole Nation was ſo <hi>Edified</hi> in the True Religion, that there was ſcarce <hi>one</hi> in an <hi>hundred</hi> but forſook and abhorred all <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrines and Superſtitions; which is an undeniable Argument, that in this reſpect alſo it is as <hi>Edifying,</hi> as it is poſſible for a thing of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be. Inſomuch that ſo long as the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> is uſed and frequented as it ought to be, it is morally impoſſible for <hi>Popery</hi> to get any ground amongſt us. But if this Bulwark was once removed (which God forbid) our grand Adverſary would ſoon accompliſh his malicious Deſigns upon us, one way or other.</p>
            <p>THIS he knows well enough, and therefore hath left no Stone unturned ſo effect it. But what he hath done before by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> he afterwards brought about again by other means in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt. For by what kind of Spirit the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> was then caſt out you all know, and ſome of you found by <hi>woful Experience.</hi> All that I ſhall ſay of it, is only this, that the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> that then ſtirred up People ſo violently
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:003624_0042_100235BDC3768538"/>
againſt the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> ſtirred them up at the ſame time to <hi>rebel</hi> againſt their <hi>King,</hi> to take away Mens <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Lives</hi> contrary to all <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi>; and at laſt to <hi>murther</hi> one of the moſt <hi>pious Princes</hi> that ever lived. And whether that was the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> or <hi>Antichriſt, God</hi> or the <hi>Devil,</hi> judge you. Be ſure the Conſequences of its being laid aſide at that Time were very ſad. For Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being deprived of that whereby they ſhould have been <hi>Edified,</hi> were immediately toſſed to and fro with every <hi>Wind</hi> of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> until at length many of them fell into the moſt <hi>pernicious</hi> and <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Hereſies</hi> that were ever heard of in the <hi>Church.</hi> Yea, together with the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> they laid aſide all Diſtinction betwixt ſacred and common things; by which means the whole Nation was in Danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overſpread with Prophaneneſs and Irreligion.</p>
            <p>But bleſſed be the Name of the moſt high God for it, he was once more pleaſed to appear for us, and in a miraculous manner to reſtore our <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> to his Church, together with our Gracious Sovereign to his Kingdoms. But what ſhall we render to the Lord for ſo great a Bleſſing as this is? All that he expects, or we can give him for it, is only to make the beſt uſe of it that we can. This therefore is that which I now pray and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you all for the future to do. Do not think it enough to be for the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and to come now and then to hear it. This you may do, as many do, and yet receive no more Benefit by it, than as if there were none at all to be received. Which therefore can by no means be imputed to the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> it ſelf, but to the Negligence of thoſe that uſe it. Neither muſt you think it enough to talk high for it, or to rail at thoſe who are not ſo happy as to be rightly informed about it. But rather take all Opportunities to inform them, and by all means poſſible to convince them of the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:003624_0043_1002359DC0032C80"/>
               <hi>Excellency</hi> and <hi>Uſefulneſs</hi> of it. Which you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do ſo effectually, as by your out-ſtripping and exceeding them in Virtue and good Works. For this is, and ever will be, a plain Demonſtration, that the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> is indeed far more <hi>Edifying</hi> than thoſe New Modes of Religion, which they are ſo unhappily ſeduced into. That therefore you may do this, and ſo both experience in your ſelves, and demonſtrate unto others, the Truth and Certainty of what you have now heard concerning the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer,</hi> I deſire you to obſerve theſe few Rules in the uſing of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> COME not to your publick Prayers only out of Cuſtom, or for Faſhion-ſake, as the manner of ſome is, but out of a ſincere Obedience to God's Commands, and with a ſure Truſt and Confidence in his Promiſes for his Bleſſing upon what you do. For which end it will be very good, as you go to <hi>Church,</hi> to bethink your ſelves whither you are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and what you are to do there, that ſo laying aſide all other Buſineſs, you may put your ſelves into a right Temper for ſo great a Work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> FREQUENT our publick Prayers as often as conveniently you can, The oftner you are at them, the better you will like them, and the more <hi>Edify'd</hi> you will be by them. And therefore do not ſatisfy yourſelves with hearing them once a Week. In this <hi>City,</hi> as alſo in many other places of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> eſpecially where there are <hi>Cathedrals,</hi> or <hi>Collegiate</hi> Churches, you may enjoy the Benefit of them publickly every Day, and ſo keep your Hearts continually in an Holy and Heavenly Frame, and always live as becometh Chriſtians: And if you neglect ſuch Opportunities as are now put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Hands, you will one Day wiſh you had not; but then wiſhing will do no good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:003624_0044_100235BF50251268"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> IF poſſible, come always at the Beginning of Divine Service. Otherwiſe you will certainly miſs of ſomething that would have been <hi>Edifying</hi> to you, and perhaps of that, which at that time might have done you more good than all the reſt. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will you loſe the Benefit only of part of it, but in ſome meaſure of the whole too; all the parts of it being linked together in ſo excellent a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and method, that they influence and aſſiſt each other. So that nothing can be omitted either by Miniſter or People, but the whole will ſuffer by it, and loſe ſomething of that Virtue and Efficacy, which otherwiſe you will find in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> ALL the while that you are in <hi>God's Houſe,</hi> carry yourſelf as in his ſpecial Preſence, and ſuitably to the work you are about: <hi>ſtanding</hi> while you praiſe God, and <hi>kneeling</hi> when you pray unto him, as our Church hath directed you. For tho' theſe may ſeem but little things in themſelves, yet they are of great Conſequence, both to our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of God aright, and to our being <hi>Edified</hi> by what we do, as I have ſhewed before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> TAKE ſpecial care all along to keep your Minds intent upon the matter in hand; when you confeſs your Sins to God, do it with an hearty and ſincere Repentance for all the Errors of your Life paſt. When the <hi>Abſolution</hi> is pronounced, receive it with a firm and ſtedfaſt Faith in Chriſt our Saviour. When yon Repeat or Sing the <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Pſalms,</hi> raiſe up your Spirits as high as you can, to join with thoſe above in praiſing and magnifying the Eternal God. When the Word of God is Read, hearken diligently unto it, and conſider ſeriouſly what he that made you, ſaith to you, and requireth of you, and reſolve by his Bleſſing to believe and live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. And all the while that you are upon your
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:003624_0045_100235A069F5DDF8"/>
               <hi>Knees,</hi> putting up your Petitions to the moſt high God, let your whole Souls be imployed in it, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſiring the good things you pray for at his gracious Hands, and humbly confiding on his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Promiſes for the granting of them. By this means you will perform reaſonable Service unto God, and by conſequence that which will be very accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto him, and as profitable and <hi>edifying</hi> to your ſelves. Whereas they that do not obſerve this Rule, cannot be properly ſaid to pray, or ſerve God at all. And therefore it is no wonder that they come to Church and hear the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> read, and yet are no way <hi>edified</hi> by it. Indeed it is impoſſible they ſhould. Foraſmuch as all the Benefit and <hi>Edification</hi> that we can poſſibly receive from any of our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, depends very much upon the due Intention of our Minds in the Performance of them. To which, as I have ſhewn, both a Form of Prayer in general, and ours in particular, is a very great help.</p>
            <p>DO but obſerve theſe plain and neceſſary Rules in uſing of the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> (without which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be truly ſaid to uſe, but rather to abuſe it) and you will ſoon find what I have ſaid about it to be true, even that <hi>All things in it are done to Edifying.</hi> And therefore I would to God, that not only you that hear me at this time, but all the People of the Nation, could be once perſuaded to do ſo. What an holy Nation, what a peculiar People ſhould we then become? How <hi>Pious</hi> towards <hi>God</hi>? How <hi>Loyal</hi> to our <hi>Sovereign</hi>? How <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Charitable</hi> to one another? For by our conſtant Worſhipping Almighty God in ſo ſolemn and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout a manner as this is, our Hearts will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed with ſo great a Fear of his Divine Majeſty, that we ſhould never dare willingly to offend him.
