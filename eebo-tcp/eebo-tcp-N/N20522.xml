            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IF this aſſembly were convened, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of liſtening to a diſſertation on the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ſubjects of freedom and ſlavery, the fact would appear ſingular, in the view of a ſtranger. For certainly, a nation, which has led the reſt of the world to the conſideration of theſe moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting topics, and fully diſcloſed the nature of the latter, ought to furniſh no employment for the advocate of the former. And if any thing can ſound like a ſoleciſm in the ears of mankind, it will be this ſtory—That in the United States of America, ſocieties are formed for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of freedom. Will not the enquiry inſtantly be made—"Are the United States of America not free? Poſſeſſed of the beſt country, the wiſeſt gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, and the moſt virtuous inhabitants, on the face of the earth; are they ſtill enſlaved?" No—America is not enſlaved; ſhe is free. Her country is ſtill excellent, her government wife, and her inhabitants virtuous. But this reply muſt be mixed with one baſe ingredient. The ſlavery of negroes is ſtill ſuffered to exiſt. The anſwer being given, the aſtoniſhment will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:026922_0003_0FD264292BEF9AB8"/>
ceaſe, and the enquiry become cool and ſpiritleſſ. Whether negroes are enſlaved, or free; miſerable, or happy; are queſtions not intereſting to their whiter maſters. Placed by Providence in a more fortunate ſituation, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by that love of domination, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in man, they become much more active in ſecuring the ſubjects of their tyranny, than in the extenſion of human happineſs. Nor is this all. Such is the depravity of our nature and the force of habit, that Reaſon is too often called in to aid the dictates of Paſſion, and ſanction the cruelties of Tyranny,</p>
            <p>THE exiſtence of African ſlavery then even in the ſtate of Connecticut, being a fact which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits not of contradiction, the propriety of Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions like that, which has brought this audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence together, will ſufficiently appear. Nor will the frequent recurrence of this meeting, in the ſmalleſt degree leſſen the importance of its duty. For tho' to the ear of cold and nerveleſs Apathy, the frequent detail of iniquities ſteadily commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and of duties too often neglected, may be a tedious and painful talk; yet the benevolent heart can never be unintereſted, when liſtening to a rehearſal of the wretchedneſs of man, or when contemplating the proſpect of his encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing felicity.</p>
            <p>THERE is not a point of view, in which Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſlavery has not been conſidered by men of the firſt talents for reſearch, for detail, and for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. The labours of the poet, the hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, the legiſlator, and the divine, have often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the ſubject in the ſtrongeſt, and moſt odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous colours. Still the evil exiſts; and Intereſt
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:026922_0004_0FD2642A45F36830"/>
alone has been able to withſtand the united force of imagination, of eloquence, of truth, and of religion. I ſay Intereſt alone; for I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to aſſert, that when it ſhall ceaſe to be for the intereſt of mankind, to torture their fellow creatures in this wicked commerce, not one ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary individual will be found trafficking in human fleſh. Thoſe commands of the Deity, which are now impiousſly appealed to, as a ſanction for barbarity and murder, will then be paſſed by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded; and theſe defenceleſs objects of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, will be left in the quiet enjoyment of their native ſimplicity, innocence, and happineſs. Where is the zealous apoſtle of truth, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it to be the will of the compaſſionate God, that every being, among his creatures, who wears a fable complexion, ſhould be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the moſt abject ſervitude, would riſque his property, his health, and his life, on a tedious and dangerous voyage, merely to fulfil the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Heaven, It is preſumed, that ſuch an inſtance cannot be found, among the ſons of men. And thoſe perſons who juſtify ſlavery by the permiſſion, or command of God, muſt believe that the omniſcient Jehovah paid but a ſlender regard to a part of his will, which is oppoſed by every emotion of generoſity, compaſſion and ſenſibility, when he ſubmitted the chance of its propagation, to the uncertain management of human intereſt.</p>
            <p>PERSUADED that Intereſt then is the only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a practice ſo wicked, ſo deteſtable, and ſo deſtructive in its effects on the human mind, I ſhall be pardoned for the manifeſtation, at leaſt of earneſtneſs, in the following deſultory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, on ſome of the reaſons, urged againſt
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026922_0005_0FD2642DA6C60298"/>
the total abolition of ſlavery, in the ſtate of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut. Theſe remarks may perhaps be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſed, or ſucceeded by others, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure deſcriptive of its nature, and of its effects on the human mind.</p>
            <p>WITHIN a few years paſt, the ſubject of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very has been repeatedly diſcuſſed, in the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature of this ſtate, with great force of reaſoning, and eloquence. The injuſtice of it has been generally, if not uniformly acknowledged; and the practice of it ſeverely reprobated. But when the queſtion of total abolition has been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly put, it has met with ſteady oppoſition, and has hitherto miſcarried, on the ground of politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal expediency—That is, it is confeſſed to be <hi>morally wrong,</hi> to subject any claſs of our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatures to the evils of ſlavery; but aſſerted to be <hi>politically right, to keep them</hi> in ſuch ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Without attending to this ſtrange, and unfounded doctrine, in itſelf, I will conſider ſome of the arguments, uſed in ſupport of that political rectitude.</p>
            <p>IT is ſaid, that the ſlavery of negroes was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced <hi>by our anceſtors</hi>—who, are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to have been generally humane and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and yet never queſtioned its rectitude; from them it <hi>deſcended to us</hi>; therefore, as <hi>we inherit</hi> the evil, we are at liberty to extricate our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from it <hi>by degrees</hi>; and are not bound to do it <hi>immediately.</hi> In ſupport of this doctrine, we are told—that, tho' <hi>the blacks</hi> have a claim to juſtice, <hi>the whites</hi> have alſo a claim; that by doing <hi>ſtrict juſtice</hi> to them, we ſhall do <hi>injuſtice</hi> to ourſelves; and that we ought not to conſult the intereſts of <hi>one part of the community,</hi> at the expenſe of <hi>another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:026922_0006_0FD2642EC9037AD8"/>IT being then acknowledged, that the enſlav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Africans was wrong in the firſt inſtance, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that the continuance of it is wrong: for a continued ſucceſſion of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt actions, can never gain the pure character of juſtice. If it was originally wrong, it has never ceaſed to be wrong for a moment ſince; and length of time, inſtead of ſactioning, aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the tranſgreſſion. This mode of reaſoning is uniformly adopted by courts of juſtice, when deciding on queſtions of property, by the rules of municipal law. No tribunal ever admitted a plea of injuſtice on the part of a father, in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his ſon, to whom the fruits of his ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, or wicked conduct had deſcended. So far is this from the fact, that every perſon, found guilty of withholding ſtrict juſtice from his neighbour, on ſuch a frivolous pretence, is forced by the laws of his country to compenſate the perſon injured, for every moment, during which the claim remains unanſwered. And certainly, the moral law enjoins a very different doctrine from that, againſt which I am contending. <q>I the Lord, am a jealous God, viſiting the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of the fathers, upon the children</q>—is the ſtrong, and unequivocal language of the decalogue. And if any man ſhould deny ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial right to another, for the reaſons which I have mentioned, the voice of common ſenſe, as well as of law, would juſtify his creditor in caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him into priſon, until he ſhould pay the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt farthing. And what is the real ground of this difference, in the adminiſtration of juſtice, between white men, and negroes? Simply this—the white men can appeal to the laws of their country, and enforce their rights. The negroes whom our fathers, and ourſelves have enſlaved,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026922_0007_0FD26431EE1D30E8"/>
have no tribunal to liſten to their complaints, or to redreſs their injuries. Forced from their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, their friends, and their families, they are dragged to the ſufferance of ſlavery, of torture, and of death, with no eye, and no arm, but the eye and arm of God, to pity, and to puniſh their wrongs. Society recognizes their exiſtence, only for the purpoſes of injuſtice, oppreſſion, and puniſhment.</p>
            <p>BY doing ſtrict juſtice to the negroes, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume is meant, totally to aboliſh ſlavery, and place them on the ſame ground, with free white men. The injuſtice, which, it is conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, will proceed from the immediate accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of this end, in the firſt place reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects the property of the perſons, who hold ſlaves. It is ſaid, that they were purchaſed under the ſanction of the laws of the country; and therefore, arbitrarily to deprive the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſuch property, without any retribution, would be injuſtice. This is combining two queſtions, which have no relation to each other. The right of the ſlave to liberty, is a diſtinct conſideration, from the right of the maſter to a compenſation for the loſs of his ſlave. Nor will the act of government, in granting freedom to the ſlave, weaken the maſter's claim for that compenſation; but if it is juſt, at the time when the ſlave is ſet at liberty, it will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever remain juſt until it is ſatisfied. Emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating the ſlave, then, ſubject the maſter to no diſadvantage, in obtaining from govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the value of the ſlave; and therefore holding the ſlave in bondage, until com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation is made to the maſter, is clearly unjuſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:026922_0008_0FD26433BA240880"/>BUT this queſtion muſt be conſidered on ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different ground. "The rights of perſons," ſays a ſenſible writer on the laws of England, <q>conſidered in their natural capacities, are of two forts, abſolute, and relative. By the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute rights of mankind, we mean thoſe, which are ſo in their primary, and ſtricteſt ſenſe; ſuch as would belong to their perſons merely in a ſtate of nature, and which every man is entitled to enjoy, whether out of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, or in it. And theſe may be reduced to three principal, or primary articles; the right of perſonal ſecurity, the right of perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al liberty, and the right of private property.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Blackſtone's Commentaries.</note> No perſon, who hears me, will deny the juſtice, or reaſonableneſs of this doctrine. Conſidering it, then, as acknowledged, it is evident, that the right of private property, ſtanding in a ſtation, ſubordinate to the right of perſonal ſecurity, and the right of perſonal liberty, merits an inferiour conſideration. Therefore, previouſly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing, and eſtabliſhing the right of private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, the rights of perſonal ſecurity, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal liberty, muſt be diſcuſſed, and eſtabliſhed. If this reaſoning be juſt, it is impoſſible, in any ſituation, or under the authority of any laws, to acquire a property in a human being. For it cannot be acquired, without a violation of rights, to which he has a prior, and abſolute claim; and which are of inconceivably greater import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The reſult, then, muſt neceſſarily be, that, in aboliſhing African ſlavery, no injury is done to private property.</p>
            <p>BUT granting, for the moment, that proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026922_0009_0FD26434A60E8DC0"/>
can be gained in the body and mind of man; a conceſſion which can ſcarcely be made, for the ſake of argument, without horror; I deny, that any ſuch property ever was gained, in this ſtate, under the ſanction of law. Search the ſtatute books of Connecticut, from the date of its Charter to the preſent moment, and tell me where is the law which eſtabliſhes ſuch an inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man privilege? Happily for the honour of the ſtate, thoſe books were never ſtained with ſo black a ſtatute. But it will be replied, that ſlavery is ſanctioned by Preſcription, and impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly allowed by the laws of the land. "To make a particular Cuſtom good," ſays the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed juriſprudent, from whom I have already quoted, <q>the following are neceſſary requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites—That it have been uſed ſo long, that the memory of man runneth not to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. So that if any one can ſhew the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, it is no good cuſtom.</q> It would not be a difficult taſk, to diſcover the beginning of the Cuſtom under conſideration. "It muſt have been continued. Which muſt be underſtood of the right; for if the right be any how diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a day, the Cuſtom is quite at an end."—The right of the Cuſtom of ſlavery, is given up by much the greater part of the community. "It muſt have been peaceable—It muſt be reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble." Surely no man will contend that this Cuſtom is either peaceable, or reaſonable. The reaſon of man riſes in uniform oppoſition to it; and it is marked in every ſtage with war, barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and murder.</p>
            <p>BUT if this Preſcription, or Cuſtom, when tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the rules of the Engliſh common law, would ſtand the teſt, ſtill I contend, that no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptive right, can infringe the abſolute rights of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026922_0010_0FD264364E867D98"/>
mankind. Theſe, eſpecially perſonal ſecurity, and perſonal liberty, cannot be violated but by the poſitive laws of ſociety. Such laws, I have already remarked, do not exiſt, in the code of Connecticut. But in that code there does exiſt a law, which ſpeaks emphatically the oppoſite language. <q>No man's perſon ſhall be arreſted, reſtrained, or any ways puniſhed—No man ſhall be deprived of his wife, or children—No man's goods or eſtate ſhall be taken away from him, nor any ways indama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, under colour of the law, or countenance of authority, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs clearly warranted by the laws of this ſtate.</q> Are not negroes men? Are they not arreſted, reſtrained, and puniſhed? Are they not depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of their wives, and children? Are not their goods and eſtate taken from them, and endama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, under colour of law, and countenance of authority alone? For the Cuſtom, ſo often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, can have no force, if there is a poſitive ſtatute authorizing African ſlavery; and if there is no ſuch ſtatute, African ſlavery muſt owe its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, ſolely to the countenance of authority.</p>
            <p>BUT to make a ſtill ſtronger conceſſion, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the friends of ſlavery than thoſe already made, viz. That the abſolute rights of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals <hi>are</hi> ſubject to violation, under the author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of Cuſtom, and that ſuch Cuſtom, having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, <hi>is</hi> clearly warranted by the laws of this ſtate, yet I venture to aſſert, that no Cuſtom and no Law, which a ſtate where ſlavery is practiſed, either has made, or can make, ought to affect the enſlaved negroes at all, unleſs deſigned as a partial compenſation for the injuries which they have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered—injuries, for which all the wealth of man can never alone. The right of ſociety to make
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:026922_0011_0FD26437B78C5258"/>
laws of any deſcription, depends entirely on the original compact, which formed the ſociety. This compact, muſt have the real, or implied aſſent of every perſon, who is to be bound by the regulations of the ſociety. Every perſon, then, who is forced to ſubmit to the laws, and inſtitutions of ſociety, has a right to be heard, either in perſon, or by his repreſentative, when thoſe laws and inſtitutions are framed; and every perſon, who is forced to ſubmit to ſuch laws and inſtitutions, without the opportunity of being thus heard, is forced to ſubmit to the hard, and oppreſſive hand of Tyranny. Slaves then, having never really, nor impliedly agreed to any ſocial compact, and never being heard, either perſonally, or repreſentatively in the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, form no part of the ſocial body; and therefore cannot juſtly be the object of laws, except in the caſe I have already inſtanced. On the contrary, ſo far from uniting voluntarily with ſocieties, in this country, they are bro't in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by force, and by force ſubjected to the laws, and regulations of powers, which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acknowledged, and to which they owe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obedience, nor gratitude. Being thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into a ſtate of hoſtility, if defenſive war is ſuſceptible of juſtification, in any poſſible inſtance, this is that inſtance. Their lives, their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, their liberty, their happineſs, are perpetually expoſed to the inroads of every mercileſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader. And tho', as the finiſhing ſtroke to their ſyſtems of guilt, ſocieties think fit to puniſh thoſe acts in ſlaves, which indeed in their own mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, would be both civil and moral evils; yet, probably on the ſtrength of reaſoning ſimilar to that which I have adopted, an elegant Engliſh writer, pronounces it "impoſſible for a ſlave, to be guilty of a civil crime."

For proof of this, we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to thoſe parts of the United States, where ſlavery is moſt extenſively practiſed. In the four ſouthern ſtates, there exiſts the ſtrongeſt ſpirit of ariſtocracy to be found in the union. This aſſertion I dare to make, in defiance of all the clamour, which can be raiſed to contradict it. Where is that ſpirit of republicaniſm, equality, freedom, and enmity to tyranny, of which they ſo arrogantly boaſt? Believe me, they exiſt but in found. Domeſtic deſpotiſm rides tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly over the liberties, and happineſs of thouſands of our fellow-creatures, in each of thoſe pretended republics. In no other country on earth, is ſlavery carried to ſuch a length of oppreſſion. Not contented with the common round of cruelty and wickedneſs, the maſters there mock their ſlaves with the name of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, which they never enjoy; and thus force them to contribute to the ſtrengthening of the powers, which hold them in bondage. Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no rank in the community, and poſſeſſing no voice, either in elections, or legiſlation, the ſlaves are bro't into exiſtence, in the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the United States, merely to afford oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for a few more of their maſters, to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over their liberties. And no event could fill theſe ſtates with ſuch alarming apprehenſions, as the erection of the ſtandard of Freedom among their enſlaved ſubjects. Therefore, before they upbraid the citizens of the northern ſtates, with an attachment to the principles of ariſtocracy, or monarchy, let them begin the equal commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of thoſe privileges, which <hi>in theory,</hi> they confeſs to be the birth right of man.

            <p>ON the whole, every ſpecies of wickedneſs reſults from ſlavery, wherever it exiſts.

All the honeſt, and virtuous em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of life, falling to the ſhare of the ſlaves, the maſter naturally avoids them as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his dignity, and plunges into habits of indolence, and vice, equally deſtructive, and diſgraceful to ſociety. Even the females, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe amiable, and endearing qualities, which bend the fiercer nature of man to gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and love, indulge themſelves in paroxiſms of rage; and under the influence of the moſt ferocious paſſions, ſeize the engines of torture,

            <p>AT the preſent period, when the principles of liberty are ſo highly revered, and the practice of them ſo juſtly admired, every queſtion, in which they are involved, ought to be diſcuſſed by the ſoundeſt reaſon, and eſtabliſhed on the moſt ſubſtantial juſtice. For when the perſons intereſted in the event of ſuch diſcuſſion, are of ſufficient force to be formidable, thoſe who are hardy enough to withhold their unalienable rights, will find themſelves plunged in a deluge of calamity. Every inſtance on hiſtorical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and every example before our eyes, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly teaches this ſolemn truth. Without waſting time in multiplying caſes, I will only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to one of the latter deſcription. The ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of France, and ſome of her moſt important
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:026922_0015_0FD2644166DE8BD8"/>
colonies, affords a melancholy proof, that a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation from the path of reaſon and juſtice, in the purſuit of freedom, is neceſſarily attended, with the moſt diſtreſſing evils. When the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of the nation were guided by diſcretion and integrity, the ſurrounding world beheld with admiration and applauſe, a ſtupendous object in the great ſyſtem of Providence—one of the moſt numerous and mighty nations, on the earth, led by the hand of Reaſon alone to the acquiſition of freedom and happineſs. But when the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment was ſiezed by a profligate, and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty junto, which, for a period, forced the infatuated republic to aſſaſſination and ruin,
<q>
                  <l>Then fell the flower of Gallia, mighty names,</l>
                  <l>Her hoary ſenators, and gaſping patriots.</l>

            <p>FROM France, turn your attention to the iſland of St. Domingo. A ſucceſſion of unjuſt, and contradictory meaſures, in both the national and colonial governments, at length highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated the negroes, and rouſed their ſpirits to unanimity and fanaticiſm. Seized by the phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy of oppreſſed human nature, they ſuddenly awoke from the lethargy of ſlavery, attacked their tyrannical maſters, ſpread deſolation and blood over the face of the colony, and by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of vigorous efforts, eſtabliſhed themſelves on
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026922_0016_0FD26442E4949FC0"/>
the firm pillars of freedom and independence. Driven from their houſes and poſſeſſions, by new and exulting maſters, the domeſtic tyrants of that iſland wander over the face of the earth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on the uncertain hand of Charity for ſhelter, and for bread. To the honour of Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans, it is true, that in this country, they have realized the moſt liberal humanity. But by a diſpenſation of Providence which Humanity muſt applaud, they are forced to exhibit, in the moſt convincing manner, this important truth—that deſpotiſm and cruelty, whether in the family, or the nation, can never reſiſt the energy of enrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and oppreſſed man, ſtruggling for freedom.</p>
            <p>THESE evils may perhaps appear diſtant from us; yet to ſome of our ſiſter ſtates they are probably nigh, even at the doors. Ideas of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty and ſlavery, have taken ſuch ſtrong hold of the negroes, that unleſs their ſituation is ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ameliorated, the inhabitants of the ſouthern ſtates, will have the utmoſt reaſon to dread the effects of inſurrection. And with the example of the Weſt-Indies before their eyes, they will be worſe than mad, if they do not adopt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al meaſures to eſcape their danger. To oppoſe the ſlaves by force when in a ſtate of rebellion, or to hold them in their preſent condition, for any conſiderable length of time in future, will be beyond their ſtrength. Courage and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, form but a feeble front, to check the onſet of freedom.

warfare? Surely, no friend to freedom and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice will dare to lend them his aid. In a caſe, not eſſentially different in principle from the one under conſideration, except its being leſs aggravated, the God of Heaven has uttered the following denunciation. <q>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty every one to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and every man to his brother: Behold I proclaim a liberty for you, ſaith the Lord, to the ſword, to the peſtilence, and to the famine.

And I will give the men that have tranſgreſſed my covenant, into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them, which ſeek their life.

Indeed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy has been moſt minutely fulfilled in the iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and already mentioned.</p>
            <p>IN this ſtate indeed, and with the ſincereſt pleaſure I make the remark, in conſequence of the ſmall number of ſlaves, the advancement of civilization, and the diffuſion of a liberal policy, the ſituation of the negroes is eſſentially differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Expoſed to few ſevere puniſhments, and indulged in many amuſements, compared with what is found in moſt other countries, they are here flouriſhing, and happy. But even here they are ſlaves.

So neceſſary is freedom to happineſs, that the mind, well informed of its nature, and acquainted with its bleſſings, if ſubjected to the will of an arbitrary and cruel maſter, would be wretched and ſolitary, altho' ſurrounded by all the pleaſures of the garden of God. But as ſlaves do in fact exiſt in Connecticut, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the ſtate, as it reſpects this great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, muſt be divided into two claſſes—thoſe, who juſtify ſlavery in the abſtract—and thoſe, who condemn it. And this general diviſion will be found to comprehend every intermediate ſtage of character. For tho' the number of perſons is ſmall, who will avowedly advocate the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of ſlavery; yet ſuch perſons do not only exiſt, but have the hardihood to appeal for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to ſupport their barbarous ſentiments, to the fountain of our holy religion, which breathes nought but peace and good will to man. But there is another more ſpecious deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perſons, which I claſs among the enemies of the freedom and happineſs of mankind. Theſe perſons proſeſſedly acknowledge the wickedneſs of ſlavery, and ſtill, on the pretence of political expediency, uſe every artifice of ingenuity and fraud, to rivet the fetters, which bind their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creatures in bondage. Such perſons, deaf to the voice of Reaſon, and the ſupplications of Humanity, bend every object to the advancement of their wealth, and the gratification of their ambition; while the groans of dying Innocence, the ſcreams of violated Chaſtity, and the ravings of tortured Maniacks, would ſleep on their ears like the gentle muſick of the paſſing gale. To ſuch perſons, as well as to thoſe of the ſecond claſs, which I have mentioned, a few enſlaved, wretched beings, appeal for the bleſſings of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

On the part of the ſlaves, it is a queſtion of right; and on that of the ſtate, a queſtion of juſtice—a queſtion, which cannot be ſuppreſſed by the ſtrong pleadings of Avarice, nor hidden in the ſubterfuges of Sophiſtry. The firſt of theſe ſpirits is not more oppoſed to humanity, than the latter is to integrity. Sophiſtry may at times aſſiſt the advocate at the bar, when eſpouſing the cauſe of iniquity; but in a legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor it muſt ever be infamous, and the conſcience of an honeſt man will never ſubmit to its impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. Nor ſhould motives of ambition be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to operate, to the deſtruction of human happineſs. It is a poſſeſſion of too much value, to be held by ſo frail a tenure. Depraved indeed muſt be the heart of that man, who will ſwerve from the rigid rules of juſtice and duty, to aid his ambitious projects. Equally depraved, and if poſſible more execrable, is the unfeeling fav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, who will lengthen out the miſery of a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low being with a ſmile of ſarcaſtic pleaſure on his fraudful countenance. In the hour of diſtreſs and apprehenſion, gloomy and bitter muſt be the reflections of ſuch a mind. But to the mind animated with a love of juſtice, and glowing with the pureſt benevolence, the valley of the ſhadow of death, will open a peaceful paſſage to the preſence of his God.</p>
            <p>IF the arguments which I have uſed, as well as innumerable others which are conſtantly urged in oppoſition to ſlavery, cannot be fully anſwered and refuted, may it not be hoped, that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique of oppreſſion, ſo odious and ſo wicked, will be ſpeedily extirpated in the ſtate of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut. Why ſhould a countenance in this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py land, be ſaddened with the melancholy evil!

Can it be urged as a reaſon for its continuance, that the ſlaves, not being numerous enough to become troubleſome, are unworthy of the pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lic attention? A regard to the happineſs of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, occupying but a point in his dominions, deſtitute even of the claim of juſtice, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on his will for exiſtence, induced the Son of the living God to exchange the boſom of his Father, for a cruel, and ignominious death. And ſhall we refuſe ſo ſlightly to imitate this illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous example? The ſlaves are ſufficiently nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and ſufficiently important, to be highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, by being ſtripped of the only bleſſing, which can render life worth enjoying. For where is the being, who would not rather yield up his life a ſacrifice, than part with his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? The wretch, if ſuch an one can be found, is unworthy of the name of man.</p>
            <p>WHO then can charge the negroes with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, or cruelty, when "they riſe in all the vigour of inſulted nature," and avenge their wrongs? What American will not admire their exertions, to accompliſh their own deliverance? Every friend to juſtice and freedom, while his heart bleeds at the recital of the devaſtation and ſlaughter, which neceſſarily attend ſuch convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of liberty, muſt thank his God for the emancipation of every individual from the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſlavery.
