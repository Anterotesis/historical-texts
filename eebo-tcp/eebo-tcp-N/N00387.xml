            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN true Love and Good will I have writ the following Treatise unto you, hoping it may find entertainment with some among you, to give it the Reading, and seriously to consider what ye read; and my earnest Exhortation and Advice is unto you, that in all your reading, whether in this or any other Book, ye turn your minds to that Light of Christ within you, wherewith he hath enlightned you, and all men, as the holy Scriptures declare; and that ye may believe in Christ, the Light, and Life, in you, who is the Wisdom and Power of God, and who was in all the holy Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,

And so it is, as to us, we plead not for any new Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of any new Doctrine, Faith or Gospel, differing from what Christ, and the Prophets, and Apostles have taught before us, and is large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully declared in the holy Scriptures; but for a new Revelation of the same Doctrine, Faith and Gospel which was revealed unto them: For as the Faith of the Prophets and Apostles is not enough to us, but we must also <hi>have the like precious Faith with them,</hi> 1 John 1.12. and we must see with our <hi>spiritual Eyes,</hi> and hear with our <hi>spiritual Ears,</hi> and handle with our <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual handling</hi> the <hi>Word of Life,</hi> as they did, so it must be newly revealed to us, and in us.</p>

And thus, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto these mens Doctrine, the alone adequate formal Object of all <hi>faith, knowledge, fruition, enjoyment, sight</hi> and <hi>sense</hi> of the Souls of the most excellent Saints, either now living, or that have lived in all Ages past since the Apostles lived, is the Scripture-words. But this is all meerly begged, and taken for granted, without all proof, and altogether contradictory to the experience of all the true Saints of God, who have an inward sight, knowledge and enjoyment of God, far surpassing all Words or Writings; And thus, according to these mens Doctrine, all the knowledge or sight that the Saints have of God in this Life, is but as one that seeth <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in a Map, but never saw the Land it self; or as an hungry man, heareth and readeth good words of Meat, but neither seeth, nor tasteth it; and as a Woman heareth of a Husband she is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried unto, or seeth his Picture on a Table, or on

But if the inward Light, or Illumination be altogether an unknown Principle to him that hath it, having no Evidence, or Light, or Demonstration of its own, whereby to discover it, how shall any man be sure, or know surely that he hath any inward divine Light or Illumination; for no Scripture can tell him that he hath it, or that he hath the Works of one that is divinely illuminated. One would think the bear naming, or mentioning such Doctrine, is enough to refute it, as to say, God and Christ is, and can only be known by words, or report and hear-say, whereas the Scripture saith, <hi>Ear hath not heard, nor Eye seen, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And Christ opened the understanding of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, to understand the Scriptures of the Old Testament, what they did declare of him; and <hi>Paul</hi> freely confesseth, that the Scriptures of the Prophets were writ for his Learning, as well as of other men, and yet he had great plenty of <hi>divine Revelation,</hi> beyond what many of them had; and <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>he had more knowledge then his Teachers,</hi> and yet no doubt profited by them, and especially by the Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> and others

that lived with him, and before him. Next, as to the <hi>sensible</hi> and <hi>intuitive knowledge of God,</hi> it can be, and oft is without all Words, either out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly heard, or inwardly conceived, I mean words co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And so, often the Souls of God's people enjoy a sweet sight, taste, and repast of him in a deep inward quiet and stillness of mind, having no words of any sort, that can be expressed in Letters or Syllables, so much as in their present thoughts or remembrance; and this is the most excellent degree of Knowledge, and as far excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and transcendeth the other sort, as the sight, taste and feeling of a thing doth the report or hear-say of it. It is also acknowledged, that oft it pleaseth God, to joyn of his Life to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture words, as <hi>Promises, Prophecies,</hi> or any others, as we hear, read, or meditate on them, and make them as Conduits, Pipes or Cisterns, or as Cups and Flaggons, to convey the divine Influences of his Life, and living Spirit of Life, and love to our Souls, but then they hinder not our <hi>Revelation,</hi> to be a real, and true, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Revelation,</hi> as well <hi>objective,</hi> as <hi>subjective</hi>; for as in drinking of outward Wine in a Glass,

And this was it that made the two Disciples, going to <hi>Emanus,</hi> say, <hi>How did our Hearts burn within uss, while he spoke to us by the way, and opened the Scriptures unto us?</hi> And when Christ preached to the People, it is said, <hi>he spoke with Authority,</hi> that is, Power, and not as the <hi>Scribes</hi>; and so did the Apostles, as <hi>Paul</hi> declared, <hi>That his Preaching was in Demonstration of the Spirit, and of Power.</hi> And Christ and the holy Spirit spake in him to the People, when he preached; and so did it in all the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Ministers of Christ, and the Hearers, who had and knew Christ in their own hearts, had a Proof sufficient that Christ spoke in <hi>Paul,</hi> by what they felt of that spiritual Virture and Power that did flow forth through him in his Ministry. And according to this, <hi>Peter</hi> exhorted, <hi>That he who ministers, should minister of the Power that God giveth, as good Stewards of the manifold Grace of God</hi>; So they ministred not only Words, but Grace, and Power, and Life to

the hearers. And thus there is a communication of the Grace, and Graces of God, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Ministers and Hearers, but among all the Faithful, who are as one living Body, but many Members, and every Member a living Member, and ministring Life one to another, as it is in the natural Body; and this is that <hi>Communion of the Saints</hi> that the Scripture testifieth, that they had together in the Spirit, which did knit their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But he that speaketh Words, as suppose Scripture-words, and not by the Spirit of Christ speaking in him, there is no divine Seed in the Words, there is the form or body of the Words, but there is no Soul or Life in them, as he speaks them.

And it is also grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That as God hath provided that Grace, whereby some shall certainly be saved, so by the same all are put under a capacity or possibility of Salvation: and therefore that any are not saved in this world, is not because of any want, or defect in the sufficiency, or efficacy in the Grace in its own Nature; but because of them, whom God in his infinite Justice and Counsel permits finally to resist it, even as in the Parable of the Sower, the Seed was one and the same in all the

The place of Scripture, I say, they mainly abuse and wrest, to favour this evil and pernicious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, is that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9·11, 12, 13. But for the opening and vindicating of this place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, let it be considered, that here is only a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference mentioned of <hi>Iacob</hi> before <hi>Esau,</hi> how that the Elder shall serve the Younger, but this saith nothing of <hi>Esau</hi> his being absolutely repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated. The great design of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> being to show that God had chosen the Line of <hi>Iacob</hi> before the Line of <hi>Esau,</hi> and given unto that Line and Posterity of <hi>Iacob,</hi> a Preference and Dignity over the Line and Posterity of <hi>Esau,</hi> and that the reason of this Preference was not
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:000472_0089_0FA673F8E053BDD8"/>
any Works that they had done, but for some other cause hid in the secret counsel of God; and this Preference did appear, first, in chusing the Line and Posterity of <hi>Iacob,</hi> to be his Church in that peculiar Dispensation of the <hi>Mosaical Law,</hi> and given them many Prophets, and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent men, to be raised up among them, and honouring them with many great and signal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, Signs and Wonders; whereas the Posterity of <hi>Esau</hi> was not so highly favoured, and yet they had a divine Dispensation among them, which did suffice unto that present time and state. Secondly, in that God did chuse the Line of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and his Posterity, out of whom Christ should be born after the Flesh, and also the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and that out of <hi>Iacob</hi> the Gospel should go forth and be preached to all the World. 3dly, That the Nation that should come of <hi>Esau</hi> should really become Servants, and Tributaries to the Nation of <hi>Israel</hi>; and this was fulfilled in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s time, and was also a Figure of another thing to be spiritually fulfilled. And therefore this <hi>Election</hi> doth not infer any <hi>Reprobation</hi> of <hi>Esau,</hi> or his Posterity, as to their eternal estate, no more then when <hi>David</hi> said, 1 <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And because many of the People of <hi>Israel</hi> were proud, because of this choice and prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that God made of their Nation, above the Nation of <hi>Esau,</hi> so as to make them a Church to himself, when the Nation of <hi>Esau</hi> was not so favoured, for Reasons best known unto God, and for that cause did conclude, that they were always to remain a People singularly favoured of him above all other People, from first to last. To beat down this vain Conceit of theirs, <hi>Paul</hi> telleth them, <hi>first,</hi> That they are not all <hi>Israel,</hi> which are of <hi>Israel: Secondly,</hi> That as God did prefer, and make choice of the Nation of <hi>Israel,</hi> to be a gathered People and Church unto him, before the Nation of <hi>Esau,</hi> and that without any regard to their Works, or to the Works of their Fathers, but for some other hid Cause and Reason in the depth of Gods secret Counsel; so God could as freely, yea, and would prefer the poor <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were no People, to be a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto him, and a Gospel-Church, to become true Believers in the Lord Jesus Christ, when in the mean time the bulk and body of the Nation of <hi>Israel</hi> should be rejected, and cast off, at least for some time, from having any such dignity

and favour (a Remnant only being reserved, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Election of Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5.) and this <hi>Paul</hi> proveth at large, from Verse 25 of that 9th Chapter, to Verse 33. and doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prosecute it in the two following Chapters. Verse 25. &amp;c. <hi>As he saith also in</hi> Osee, <hi>I will call them my People, which were not my People, and her beloved, which was not beloved.</hi> And verse 30. <hi>What shall we say then? that the</hi> Gentiles <hi>which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed not after Righteousness, have attained to Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, even the Righteousness of Faith; but</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>which followed after the Law of Righteousness, hath not attained to the Law of Righteousness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they sought it not by Faith,</hi> &amp;c. So, we see how <hi>Paul</hi> maketh the Parallel, that as God once preferred, or chused <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Nation, before the Nation of <hi>Esau,</hi> so again he prefered and chused the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (that had no good Works to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, and to move God to make that choice) out of his free Mercy, before the People of <hi>Israel</hi>; and of these <hi>Gentiles,</hi> no doubt, many of them did belong to the Posterity of <hi>Esau,</hi> and also of <hi>Ishmael,</hi> yea, of <hi>Cain</hi>; for their is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Promise made to the Remnant of <hi>Edom,</hi> and of all the <hi>Heathen,</hi> upon whom his Name is, or shall be called, <hi>Amos</hi> 9.12. <hi>And it is but a Remnant also of</hi> Israel <hi>that is saved, until the great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fulness of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>come in, and then all</hi> Israel (to wit, the true <hi>Israel,</hi> which is not all who are of <hi>Israel</hi> after the Flesh) <hi>shall be saved</hi>; see <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.27. and 11.5.25, 26. And lastly, it is
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:000472_0092_0FA6742C401EB360"/>
to be again considered, that what God spoke unto <hi>Rebecca,</hi> before the Children were born, not having done Good or Evil, did not so much regard the singular Persons of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> as their Posterities, as is clear from <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.23. <hi>And the Lord said unto her, Two Nations are in thy Womb, and two manner of People shall be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from thy Bowels; and the one People shall be stronger t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>an the other People, and the Elder shall serve the Younger.</hi> So we see here, the words are said of the Nations of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> and not the Persons of them; for we read not any where that ever <hi>Esau</hi> in Person served <hi>Iacob,</hi> but only in his Posterity, as was fulfilled in <hi>David</hi>'s time, when the <hi>Edomites</hi> became Tributaries to the People of <hi>Israel</hi>: nor was it said before the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were born, <hi>Iacob have I loved, and</hi> Esau <hi>have I hated,</hi> as it is commonly alledged, but many hundred Years after he was deceased. And if it had been so said, it could not prove an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute rejection either of <hi>Esau,</hi> or his Posterity, as to their eternal state; for God is said in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to hate all Evil-doers, and yet many Evil-doers repent, and obtain Salvation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Hatred doth not signifie absolute and final hatred, either in God or men: for it is said, <hi>Iacob loved</hi> Rachel, <hi>and hated</hi> Leah; that is, he loved <hi>Rachel</hi> more: and Christ said, <hi>He that hateth not Father and Mother for my cause, is not worthy of me</hi>; that is, He that loveth me not more than Father and Mother.

And that Faith was the Substance of things hoped for, and had a regard to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Blessing of <hi>Esau,</hi> and of his Posterity; for though <hi>Iacob</hi> got the first Blessing, yet <hi>Esau</hi> got the second, and their two Blessings did not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in Substance, but in some weighty Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of order and time; and <hi>Isaac</hi> prophesied in <hi>Esau's</hi> Blessing, that he should have the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Earth, and dew of Heaven (the same, but the order inverted with <hi>Iacob's</hi> blessing) and that in process of time he should be a free Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to wit, in Gospel dayes, signified by these words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.40. <hi>And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt have Dominion,</hi> to wit, in Christ, in Gospel dayes, <hi>in thy Posterity, that thou shalt break his Yoke from off thy Neck.</hi> And so we find that divers (<hi>Mark</hi> 3.8.) <hi>Idumeans,</hi> that were of <hi>Esau,</hi> followed Jesus; and <hi>Iacob's</hi> putting on <hi>Esau's</hi> goodly Rayment, signified how in Gospel dayes, the true Believers of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> should become one Body of a Gospel-Church, and in this Body they of <hi>Esau</hi> should be as Hands, but the Voice is <hi>Iacob's,</hi> that is, the Word of

And if any further urge, <hi>If there be no reprobate Infants, that then all Infants are sanctified and holy, both the Children of unbelieving Parents, as well as of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</hi> I answer; It doth not follow by any necessary consequence, although to admit of that Consequence, is much more tollerable, then to say, that any Infants perish eternally, only for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin. And as for the general state of Infants, and how they are particularly disposed of immediately after Death, who dye in Infancy, seemeth a great depth, and is a great mystery, and is best known unto the Lord: For it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally granted, that God hath his way to reach to Infants, and deal with them, both in the Womb, and upon the Mothers Breasts; and therefore let us leave secret things unto God, until he reveal them, and be satisfied with what he hath revealed. Now this is plainly revealed, and declared in the Scriptures, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is not simply that <hi>Adam</hi> sinned, or his Posterity in, and with him, <hi>but that Light is come into the World, and men love Darkness more
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:000472_0096_0FA67431F9CDAB20"/>
than Light</hi>; And as by the offence of one, to wit, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And though men generally are by Nature, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Wrath (if it should be granted or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that by <hi>Nature,</hi> signifieth their natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as they are born into the world) yet by the great Mercy, Grace and favour of God, they all have an opportunity or possibility to be converted, and become the Children of God. And what that Holiness or Cleanness is, that the Children of one, or both the believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have, is a great Mystery, I am sure to many who have that Scripture place oft in their Mouthes, and greatly glory in it, that they are in Church-Covenant, and therefore they are holy, and their Children; also some call it federal or Covenant-Holiness, but what it is they know not, whether it be any real thing, or principle of Holiness, lodged or placed in their Children, more than in the Children of others that are not in their Church-Covenant, they dare not affirm; for many, yea, very many Children of professed <hi>Christians</hi> of all sorts, when they grow up to Youth, are as unholy, and sometimes worse, as the Children of Unb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lievers. But that Children generally either of Believers, or Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, are actually sanctified from the Womb, or in the Womb, cannot be proved from Scripture,

or any Observation that we can make. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded as a rare and great thing, that <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> was sanctified from the Mother's Womb, and the like of <hi>Ieremia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> and so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be gathered of <hi>Moses,</hi> or some others, but these rare and singular Examples, rather prove, that Children are not in general, actually and <hi>de facto</hi> holy from the Womb; and therefore that Holiness of Children, mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. must only signifie some more near capacity in them, than in others, to become actually holy in time to come, and that not of all Children after the Flesh, but the Children of Promise, as <hi>Paul</hi> distinguisheth these two sorts of Children of the same Parents, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8. But who are the Children of the Flesh, and who are the Children of the Promise? though it be well known unto God from the beginning, yet commonly it is not known unto men, until they discover themselves by their Works and Fruits.</p>

As concerning the general state of Mankind by means of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, what the Scripture saith of it, is readily believed and granted, and it is safest in all things, to keep to Scripture words, especially in all cases and matters that are in Controversie. For the Scripture is a rich Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury or Store-house, sufficiently to afford us Words whereby to express our Faith in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Christian Doctrine</hi>; and it is not safe to leave the Scripture-words, and go to words of mans wisdom, and thereby to declare our Faith

of Christian Doctrine.

And its said in <hi>Iob</hi> 25.4. <hi>How can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean, that is born of a Woman?</hi> to wit, in the ordinary way of Generation. And here the natural state of man is declared, before his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Regeneration in Christ Jesus: and though that was said by <hi>Bildad,</hi> one of <hi>Iob</hi>'s Friends, yet it is confirmed by <hi>Iob</hi> himself, Chap. 14.4.

                  <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</hi> But this Seed, or Principle of Sin and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, is not charged or imputed unto men, until they joyn and consent unto it, and actually obey it, as is clear from <hi>Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 5.13. <hi>For until the Law, Sin was in the World, but Sin is not imputed when there is no Law.</hi> Now, when is it that there is no <hi>law,</hi> but in the time of <hi>infancy,</hi> wherein Children are not capable of any Law, or of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good or Evil, any more then when in the Womb? For until Children begin to have the use and exercise of their reasonable understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so as to know the Right-hand from the Left (according to <hi>Ionah</hi> 4.11.) they cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to be under the Law. But to say, that any Infants are eternally damned for that first Sin, and without any actual Sin, or Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of theirs committed in their own Body, is expresly contrary to Scripture, that saith, <hi>The Soul that sinneth shall dye; and every one shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive according to the Deeds done in the Body, good or evil; and he that soweth to the Flesh, shall reap Corruption, as he that soweth to the Spirit shall reap Corruption, and Life eternal.</hi> And therefore none shall finally perish, or be lost, for that first Sin, according to Scripture, but for their actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Disobedience here in this world, and their final Unbelief and Impenitency. For as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Judgment and Punishment of the first Sin, it was immediatly inflicted after the Fall, to wit, the Death of all in <hi>Adam.</hi> But Christ the second

And how, or in what manner <hi>Adam</hi>'s Children and Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity were concerned in that first Sin, whether only by <hi>Imputation,</hi> as some say, or by <hi>real Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation,</hi> as others say, the Wise in heart may easily judge: Let it suffice at present, to say, that <hi>Adam's</hi> Children, being his Branches, and he their Root, they do really partake with him both in the defilement, and also in the promised Seed, in order to their Restoration; for when God said to <hi>Adam, In the Day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely dye</hi>; His Children and Posterity were included.

                  <hi>Nazareth,</hi> who was crucified and raised again, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.10, 11, 12. But here some will readily object, <hi>How could any of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>be justified or saved by the Man Christ Iesus, and by virtue of his Death and Resurrection, who never heard of him, &amp; never had the Mystery of it revealed unto them, &amp; consequently had not Faith in Christ crucified, and risen again</hi>? And upon this Head the Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Truth, both <hi>Presbyterean, Independent</hi> and <hi>Baptist</hi> Teachers, have taken great occasion, to cry out against the People, called in scorn <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> That <hi>their Religion is only</hi> Paganism, <hi>and not</hi> Christianity, <hi>because they say, that</hi> Heathens <hi>or</hi> Pagans <hi>can be saved by their giving Obedience to the Light within them, without having Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and raised again, outwardly preached unto them.</hi> But these Adversaries of Truth little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what Hypocrites they discover themselves to be, in this very Charge, when they make that a Crime in others, which they judge no Crime in themselves; for they themselves hold, <hi>That there are not only elect Infants, dying in Infancy, who are regenerated, and saved by Christ through the Spirit, who worketh when, where, and how he pleaseth; but other elect Persons, regenerated and saved by Christ, who are uncapable of being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly called by the Word</hi>; citing <hi>Luke</hi> 18.15, 16. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.3.5. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.8. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.8. see Cap. 10. Sect. 3. of the <hi>Westminster</hi>-Confession, owned by the <hi>New-England</hi> Churches, and printed by them at <hi>Boston.</hi> And what they say of Infants, and

other elect Persons, who are uncapable of being outwardly called by the Word, that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, and saved by Christ through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who worketh when, where, and how he pleaseth; the same, these called <hi>Quakers</hi> say, concerning the honest and faithful <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were obedient to the Light of Christ in them, and were not outwardly called by the Word, or by outward Preaching; yea, and were uncapable of being outwardly called, when living in such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Places and Ages of the world, where the outward Preaching never came within their reach. For as a deaf man is uncapable of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mans Voice, so is a man that hath his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (to wit, the faculty or sense of Hearing) uncapable of hearing the Voice of a man, that is at a greater distance than his hearing can reach it. And seeing they plainly confess, that there are such elect Persons in the world, not only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, but these come to age, who are Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and saved by Christ through the Spirit, who worketh when, where, and how he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, as their Words are, (and the Words are true, and a good use can be made of them against themselves, who have confessed them) then let them forever be ashamed to cry out any more against the honest People, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> for saying, These honest <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who have not heard of Christ outwardly preached unto them, belonging to God's Election, are saved by Christ, and regenerated through the Spirit of Christ.
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:000472_0116_0FA6744E672AA450"/>
And if the Spirit work when, where, and how he pleaseth, to wit, both in Infants, and persons at Age, who are not outwardly called by the Word, or uncapable of being so called, then let them recal and condemn their false Doctrine, that saith, <hi>God hath committed his Counsel wholly to Writing; and the former ways of God's revealing his Will unto his People are now ceased, and there is no new Revelation:</hi> as they have expresly, and without any reserve or exception, affirmed, <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 1. and <hi>sect.</hi> 6. For if God hath committed his Counsel wholly to Writing, then nothing of his Counsel is extant, where that Writing is not extant. And if all divine Revelation be ceased, then neither Infants, nor other Persons, who are uncapable of being outwardly called by the Word, have any divine Revelation, or inward Call by the Spirit: Or if Infants, and other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons belonging to God's Election, be inwardly called, and renewed by the Spirit, then God hath not committed his Counsel wholly to Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, nor are all the ways of God's revealing his Will to men ceased: for by their own Confession, it is revealed to all elect Persons, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being outwardly called by the Word, the Spirit working in them, when, where, and how he pleaseth.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But whether any are, or can be saved or justified, without the express Knowledge and Faith of Christ crucified, and risen again, is one Question; and whether without all outward
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:000472_0117_0FA6744F1A044740"/>
hearing of Christ crucified, outwardly Preached unto them, is another Question: for without all outward preaching of men, the mystery of Christ crucified can be revealed, and preached inwardly to men by the Spirit of God, and by the same Spirit, Faith can be wrought in them by that inward hearing, as these men confess. And though it may seem hard and difficult, to prove that all honest <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who did by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (to wit, by the Principle of the <hi>divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> implanted into the true Nature of Men) the things contained in the Law, had that express Knowledge and Faith of Christ crucified, and raised again; yet it is more hard and difficult unto them, who affirm they had it not, to prove it, seeing the Spirit, who worketh when, and where, and how he pleaseth, might reveal it unto them; and that they grant, <hi>the Spirit doth work in all elect Persons, who are not outwardly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Word, and doth regenerate and save them by Christ.</hi> And to the further clearing of this matter, we are to consider, that the Work of Salvation is not a thing that is commonly done in an instant, but hath its gradual Steps, its <hi>beginning, progress</hi> and <hi>finishing,</hi> even as Faith it self hath; for as at the first instant of a man's sincer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So, though they
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:000472_0119_0FA67450A860E618"/>
were entred into a state of Salvation, through Faith in Christ, yet it was not perfected in them, but was to be further wrought out; and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them in this great Work, he told them, <hi>It was God which worketh in them, both to will and to do of his own good pleasure.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the believing <hi>Romans,</hi> &amp; also himself, saying, <hi>Now is our Salvation nearer than when we believed, Rom.</hi> 13.11. And the perfect <hi>Salvation of Souls</hi> is called the <hi>end of Faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.9. And verse 10. <hi>Of which Salvation the Prophets have enquired, and searched diligently, who prophecyed of the Grace that should come unto you.</hi> Verse 11. <hi>Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ, which was in them did signifie, when it testified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand the Sufferings of Christ, and the Glory that should follow.</hi> And Verse 13. <hi>Wherefore gird up the Loins of your Mind, be sober, and hope to the end, for the Grace that is to be brought unto you in the Revelation of Iesus Christ</hi> (so the Greek hath, viz. <hi>Enapokalepsei</hi>) And Phillip. 1.6. <hi>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good Work in you, will perform it unto the Day of Iesus Christ.</hi> And as the Work of the outward Creation, is distinguished into six Dayes, and that a Day of Sabboth, or Rest, which is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: So the Work of the inward Creation, which is the creating men anew in Christ Jesus, by way of Analogy, may be said to have its six Dayes, and then the spiritual Sabboth, or Rest, according to <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.9. <hi>There remaineth therefore

a Sabboth to the People of God.</hi> And verse 11. <hi>For me that is entred into his Rest, hath ceased from his own Works, as God did from his.</hi> And verse 11. <hi>Let us labour therefore to enter into that Rest,</hi> &amp;c. Where its plain , the Writer doth hint at the said Analogy. Now though it ought to be granted, that the Knowledge and Faith of Christ crucified and raised again, doth belong to the finishing and perfecting of the Saints Salvation, yet it is most clear and plain from Scripture, that it doth not universally belong to the beginning of it. For we can prove most clearly from Scripture, that the good Work of God, even the Work of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was begun in them, who had not that Knowledge and Faith of Christ crucified; as first, to instance in <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> of whom Christ gave a noble Testimony, <hi>Behold an</hi> Israelite <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in whom is no Guile,</hi> John 1.47. And yet at that time he had not Faith in Jesus of <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> as being come in the Flesh, but reasoned or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Philip <hi>saith unto him, Come and see,</hi> &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Next, to instance in the Disciples of Christ, who for sometime, after they had followed him, and that <hi>Peter</hi> had confessed to him, that he was the Son of God, and that Christ had told him, his Father had revealed it to him; yet the mystery of his Death and Resurrection was for all that hid from him, and the rest of them: For this, see <hi>Mark</hi> 9.31. <hi>For he taught his Disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:000472_0121_0FA6745400AC9F68"/>
Hands of men, and they shall kill him, and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third Day.</hi> And verse 32. <hi>But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.</hi> See again, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.43. But that instance of <hi>Cornelius</hi> is a most manifest and clear demonstration of this Truth: for this <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> was a <hi>Gentile,</hi> and uncircumcised, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Proselite of the Covenant to be sure; and though some alledge, that he was a Proselite of the Gate (according to that distinction that was among the <hi>Iews</hi> of a two- fold sort of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selites, one of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> that received Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision and the Law, another of the <hi>Gate,</hi> that did not receive Circumcision) yet this is but barely alledged without all proof. But if he was a Proselite of the <hi>Gate,</hi> it is certain at that time, when the Angel was sent unto him, he had no express Knowledge, nor Faith of Christ cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, for that was the thing, which <hi>Peter</hi> was sent to preach unto him, by hearing of which he was to receive the holy Ghost, and be saved; for the Angel told him, <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>should speak Words to him, by which he &amp; all his House should be saved</hi>; see <hi>Acts</hi> 11.14. Now although at that time, when the Angel appeared unto him, <hi>Cornelius</hi> had no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge nor Faith of Christ crucified, yet he was in a good estate; and well were it for many called <hi>Christians,</hi> that they were in as good estate as he then was in: When the Angel appeared to him, he told him, <hi>That his Prayers, and his Alms were come up for a memorial before God,</hi> Acts 10.4.
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:000472_0122_0FA674545842D890"/>
And it is said of him, verse 2. <hi>He was a devou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> man, and one that feared God, with all his House, which gave much Alms to the People, and prayed unto God alway.</hi> And with respect to this, <hi>Peter</hi> began his Preaching, saying, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34, 35. <hi>Of a truth, I perceive that God is no respecter of Persons, but in every Nation he that feareth him, and worketh Righteousness,is accepted of him.</hi> Now who dare be so bold to say, <hi>Cornelius</hi> at this time had no real and true beginning of Salvation, or of saving Grace and Faith, before <hi>Peter</hi> did preach Christ crucified &amp; raised again unto him? For although <hi>Cornelius</hi> had not at that time Faith in Christ crucified, yet he had (without all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion) Faith in God, and in the Word of God that was in his Heart, and that Word was Christ in him, though the Mystery of Christ was not fully revealed unto him at that time, and in that state he was accepted of God, &amp; yet not for his Works sake, but for Christ. And therefore, men may have a beginning of true Faith, and of a true Work of Salvation begun in them, when the Mystery of Christ crucified, and raised again, is not revealed unto them. For that Mystery (being so great as it is) was not in that Day, to wit, before Christ came and suffered in the Flesh, preached, as one of the first and most necessary things to be first known and believed, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Faith and Knowledge of which no man could be in any degree blessed, otherwise, when Christ began to Preach, he would have preached

And each of these Dispensation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And though I say the first belonged to the Law, as inwardly dispensed, yet that very Dispensation of the Law was not meerly Legal, but had Grace and Mercy mixed with it: For no Dispensation, without the Grace and Mercy of God, could have been in any respect serviceable unto men; therefore the Law, both as outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inwardly administred, had always some measure of divine Grace mixed with it; and therefore in the second Commandment, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of all the Ten Commandments, being commonly acknowledged to have been delivered by God himself to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had not the written Law, God did reveal himself <hi>to be a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and merciful God, visiting the Iniquities of the

And since it is so, that Christ is really that Light that doth lighten the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and is Light in them, who have not heard him outwardly preached unto them it is no less than real Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy (though pardonable upon Repentance) to say, as the <hi>Presbyterean</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of both Old and <hi>New-England</hi> have said in their Confession of Faith, <hi>That the Light in men,</hi> (which they call, the Light of Nature) <hi>that doth so far manifest the Goodness, Wisdom and Power of God, as to leave men inexcusable, yet is not sufficient to give that Knowledge of God, which is necessary unto Salvation</hi>; as they expresly affirm <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 1.

And thus the true Faith doth not divide Christ, but receiveth him, and joyneth the Soul unto him intirely, to wit, the whole and intire Christ, both as he did come outwardly in the Flesh, and as he did, and doth inwardly come in the Spirit; and as the said true Faith doth not divide him, so nor doth it divide his Offices, but taketh or receiveth him in all his Offices, as <hi>King, Priest</hi> and <hi>Prophet, Shepherd, Physitian, Husband,</hi> &amp;c.

(2<hi>dly.</hi>) This perfection or freedom from Sin, and Possibility by the Grace of God, to keep his Commandments, we do not say it is attained by every one, at their first Conversion or entrance into the true Faith; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we say, many true Believers, and who have a true measure of sincerity towards God, are yet short of that state of a sinless Perfection; and that it is not attained, but by great diligence, and wrestling against sin, through the ability of the Grace of God, and much watching and
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:000472_0171_0FA67497EB78E030"/>
prayer, and using all the means appointed of God, both inwardly and outwardly, to attain to that blessed Conquest and Victory over sin. (3<hi>dly.</hi>) The most perfect in this Life, have need to watch and pray, that they enter not into Temptation; for as <hi>Adam,</hi> in Innocency, and in the Garden, did sin, and by his sin lost his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, so may men that are inwardly come to this state, if they be not duly watchful, sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord; therefore it is not the impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of sinning in all respects, that we plead for, but the possibility of not sinning, and that by the Grace of God, and not otherwise. Altho' some may arrive to that state in Holiness, in conformity to the second <hi>Adam,</hi> that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sin, nor can sin, in that sence as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth intend it, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.19. which doth at least hold forth, that such who are attained to this noble degree of Holiness, they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any gross sin (although in some things, not for want of love, but not having a full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Knowledge in all things, they may a little fall short, as a most loving Child, not perfectly understanding the Fathers mind in all things, may do a thing amiss, and yet without breach of true Love to his Father, and therefore his Father doth not charge it upon him as a crime; and the like example may be of a most loving Wife, to her Husband, who retaineth her chaste and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Love to her Husband, and yet may do some things not according to his mind; for as the

Scripture saith, <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law</hi> and he that faileth not in his Love, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresseth not against the Law of Love, though in some case he may fall short in understanding, God doth not impute it to be a crime unto him. (4<hi>thly</hi>) It is not temptations or motions unto sin, that may arise either from the Devil, or the World without them, or from the natural and mortal part in them, that we plead a freedom from; for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

their wayes, yet not being consented, or yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, nor obeyed by them, it is not in that case their Righteousness, nor doth it make them in any respect righteous, unless they joyn and yield unto it, in true Obedience. (6<hi>thly.</hi>) It is not the same degree and stature of Perfection, that God requireth of every one, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that measure and degree of Grace and Light that God hath imparted to every one, to some more, to others less, but to every one sufficient to the present time and state. For he that was faithful in the improving his two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents to make them four, was accepted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> although he made them not ten, as he that was faithful in his five, and made then ten, and they were both proportionally rewarded; hence we read of good and holy men, who are said to be perfect in their Generation, according to the Light and Grace that God gave them, in their Day and Age. And the high Priest that had on his Breast the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> that signifieth Lights and Perfections, was a Type of Christ, our great and only high Priest, who hath the <hi>Vrim,</hi> that is Lights, and the <hi>Thummim,</hi> that is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and distributeth of these Lights and Perfections variously towards his Saints and Children, but to all sufficiently. And so the degree of Perfection, and perfect Obedience ought to answer to the degree of Light and Grace that God giveth through Christ unto every one, and he who is faithful in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:000472_0174_0FA674A044CC68A8"/>
though he hath not the same equal degree and measure that another hath, is perfect in that respect; and the Child in the Child's state is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, being faithful to the Grace and Light that is given him; and if he dye in that state, he is safe, and cannot perish, as well as he that is a man in Christ, and is come up to the spiritual stature and growth of a spiritual man. So that Faithfulness in the Work and Service of God, is that which doth render a man perfect in the sight of God, according to the ability of Light and Grace received, whether in the state of a Child, Young-man, or Elder in Christ.

But this Sprinkling was not of Water, but of Blood; and we do not read that it was only on the Fore-head; and the Cups and Vessels that were sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Blood or Water, were sprinkled all ever, and not in one single place. And why did <hi>Iohn</hi> baptize Christ by dipping into Water, and others that he baptized, if sprinkling on the Fore-head was sufficient in that day? Next, as

But this saith nothing of <hi>Water,</hi> and if it were granted that Water-baptism is understood, as it neither is, nor ought to be granted, yet it will not prove that Infants should be any more baptized than taught, seeing <hi>teaching</hi> and <hi>baptizing</hi> are joyned together. Another place they cite is, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.15, 16. where Christ biddeth to <hi>suffer little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to come unto him, and forbid them not,</hi> and that <hi>he blessed them, and laid his hands upon them,</hi> we read in Scripture; but that he baptized them either with dipping or sprinkling, we read not, but on the contrary it is expresly said, <hi>That Iesus himself baptized none,</hi> to wit, <hi>with Water,</hi> see <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.2. Their last place they cite is <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. <hi>If the Root be holy, so are the Branches</hi>; but this doth not prove that Infants are more to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, than to have that called the Supper administred unto them: And these Branches mentioned by <hi>Paul</hi> in that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. were really the unbelieving <hi>Iews,</hi> that because of their Unbelief were broken off at that time, yet the Root being holy, to wit, <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the promised Seed, <hi>Paul</hi> had hope of their conversion, as many as did belong to Gods election, as he expresseth it, vers. 28. and these were not the immediate Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but forty Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations after <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isacc,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi>; and therefore this Scripture saith as much for

the aged unbelieving Children of unbelieving Parents, if they have descended from any of their fore-Fathers, upwards of forty Generations, that were Believers; and if up to forty, why not up to sixty, and further? yea, to <hi>Noah,</hi> who is the common Father of all men, with whom God established his Covenant, and with his Seed after him, until the end of the World, that all his Seed through Christ, might receive the benefit of the same, unless they do wilfully reject it; of which I have said something alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in Chap. 6.</p>

And they can never prove, by all their art and skill, that <hi>Water-Baptism</hi> is commanded by Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19. for all Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and precepts, especially of publick insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, relating to the Church, are express, in so many express Words, and are not left to be gathered by uncertain and doubtful Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. When God sent <hi>Iohn</hi> to baptize with Water, Water was expressed; but in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles Commission to baptize, no mention is made of Water, nor no words of Institution commanded to be used, but the command is, <hi>Go, teach and baptize all Nations into the Name of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost.</hi> And the Name of either the Father, or the Son, or the holy Ghost, is most frequently, if not always used in Scripture, to signifie Power and Life, as <hi>the Name of the Lord is a strong Tower: thy Name is as Ointment poured forth,</hi> &amp;c. And whereas they object, first, <hi>That the Apostles could not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize with the spiritual Baptism.</hi> I answer, yea; they could Instrumentally and Ministerially,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:000472_0196_0FA674F883E5AA58"/>
as well as they could convert, and beget Sons and Daughters unto God; for they were Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Spirit, and did minister of the Spirit, both in <hi>Preaching,</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>laying on of Hands,</hi> although God only was the principal worker and author. Next, they object, <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul, <hi>and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

In short, if these who are so zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for <hi>Water-Baptism,</hi> were cordially zealous, for the inward and spiritual Baptism, they might be the more born with, as Men bear with Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that use Likenesses and Figures of things, that sute most with the age and state of Children, and Charity might be allowed them in that case, to be as Children or Babes in Christ, if they did hunger and thirst after Righteousness, and did

wait for the inward appearance and coming of Christ's Kingdom, and the Revelation of it in their Hearts, as some such there may be. But these, who altogether are for the outwrad Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism and Supper, and deny wholly the inward and spiritual Baptism and Supper of Christ, which is only known and received by the holy Spirit's inward Revelation, no Charity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Next, concerning the Supper: We grant that Christ had an outward Supper with his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, when he did eat the Pascal Lamb with them; and this was a real Supper, and not like that which ye now use, that is neither substantial Supper nor Dinner, being only a little crumb of Bread, scarce so big as a Nut, and a spoonful of Wine, or two, which hath little outward Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and no inward and spiritual Signification unto you, as ye use it, while ye altogether deny, that the Saints are pertakers of the substance of Christ, or that Christ really and substantially dwelleth in his Saints; and while ye also deny all inward Revelation of him in these latter Ages, Your Supper is a meer shadow, and none of Christ's Supper, nor of his Institution. For when Christ did sup with his Disciples, in the Night wherein he was betrayed, he began with the Cup, and blessed, or gave thanks, and said, <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

next he took Bread, and blessed, or gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, <hi>This is my Body, this do in Remembrance of me</hi>: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise after Supper he took the Cup, saying, <hi>This Cup is the New-Testament in my Blood, drink ye all of it,</hi> Luke 22.14. to 20. So we see, he used the Cup twice, and began and ended with it, but so do not ye; and though ye seem greatly to blame the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for not giving the Cup to the People, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And seeing ye say, <hi>Ye have not that infallible Spirit that Christ had, and gave to the Apostles</hi>; and that we find you wholly ignorant of Christ's Body, and that ye have no discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, nor no taste and favour of his Flesh, which is Meat indeed, nor of his Blood, which is Drink indeed, and know not the inward and spiritual supping with Christ, we cannot believe, nor acknowledge, that ye <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> Teachers, have any power to bless either the Bread, or the Cup, as Christ did, or to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, or give of his Body and Blood to any People, which true Ministers of Christ have done, and do at this day, to my certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and joy, and to the certain knowledge and joy of many thousands with me, and that often in the use of outward eating and drinking, being
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:000472_0199_0FA674FC6BC33F40"/>
sanctified and blessed by the Word of God and Prayer, as we have sat down together, whether many or a few, we have truly witnessed the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of that saying, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.35. <hi>And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of Bread.</hi> And as it is, Vers. 30, 31. <hi>And it came to pass, as he sate at Meat with them, he took Bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them, and their Eyes were opened,</hi> (Note, even as <hi>Ionathan's</hi> Eyes were opened, or lightned, when he did eat the Honey; and as <hi>Isaac</hi> blessed <hi>Iacob</hi> when he did eat what he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared of savoury Meat for him; and as the Angel blessed <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he did eat of the Calf, and the Cakes that were set before him; and as <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> blessed <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he brought him Bread and Wine; and divers other the like examples) <hi>and they knew him,</hi> &amp;c. Even so can many say at this day, to God's praise, in the outward Eating and Drinking together, as they have sate together, and waited in true silence, until God has been pleased to move some one or other of his faithful Servants and Ministers of his Word of Life, and of his Flesh and Blood, which is spiritual, to pray unto the Lord, or give Thanks, their outward eating and drinking hath been so blessed unto them, that at one and the same time they have eat both the outward Bread with the bodily Mouth, and the inward Bread, which is spiritual, with the inward &amp; spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Mouth; and they have also drunk outwardly

the outward Cup, and inwardly the inward and spiritual: and so at the same time, they have fed at a two-fold Table, &amp; have been both inwardly and outwardly refreshed, nourished and strenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and this also often-times, in the use only of inward Prayer and Thanskgiving, as well as of both inward and outward; and yet we neither do, nor can limit the spiritual and inward eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ's Body, and drinking of his Blood, to any outward eating or drinking whatsoever. As neither did the ancient <hi>Christians,</hi> who said, <hi>That all true Believers eat Christ's Flesh, and drink his Blood, daily and hourly</hi>; and so we believe. And no doubt, Christ did really give his Body and Blood unto his Discip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And also we do believe, and say, that it is our Duty, not only in these more solemn Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Drinkings, to remember the Lord's death, and what he hath done, and suffered for us, when we thus eat &amp; drink together, perhaps many belonging to divers Families, but also in all our other Eatings and Drinkings, and at all other times, as it doth please the Lord to enable us; and every true <hi>Christian</hi> hath the Lord's Death, Resurrection, and his great Love, and what he hath done and suffered for us, printed as in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Letters, upon his very Heart and Soul, and writ as a living Epistle, with the Spirit of the living God, upon fleshly Tables; and that this ought to be done, not only to his more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant inward and spiritual coming unto us, but to be perpetuated, and continued by all true <hi>Christians,</hi> to the end of the World, and the last coming of Christ.

And though we are not for holding up, or preaching of Figures meerly institute, for to signifie and represent a thing to come, as were these under the Law; yet such a Figure as is natural, and necessarily to be used by us all, as eating and drinking, we may not reject: for the outward eating and drinking is a natural and necessary Figure of the inward, even as the whole outward World is a Figure of the inward and spiritual, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth expresly call it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31. see the <hi>Greek.</hi>

And if ye could not receive my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, I proffered to debate these things fairly with you. And though I neither had, nor have the least mind to Cavil, yet I most assuredly believe, that the Peace of your Churches is not the true Peace of Christ, but that both ye and they are set down in a false peace and rest. And therefore he, who at the command of Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and by the motion of his eternal Spirit, doth proclaim a holy War, and soundeth an alarm in your Ears, that Christ himself is come, and more abundantly coming to take away your false Peace, and to send a spiritual Sword and Fire unto you, is really your best Friend, and such a Friend I am unto you, whether ye will hear or forbear. For I came not unto you in my own will, but a necessity from the Lord, by his living Motion in my Heart, and his living Word, that was, and is as a Sword and a Fire, did lie upon me to clear my self among you. And seeing your Churches are no true Churches of Christ, as I have sufficiently demonstrated in this Treatise,
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:000472_0220_0FA6751544EF84F0"/>
their peace is no true peace, and therefore must and will be broken, and the sooner it be broken, the better it will prove to many poor Souls among you, in order to their being gathered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord. And whereas ye say in your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>If he would have a publick Audience, let him Print</hi>: Ye see how I have complyed with your Proposal, yet not in your will, but in the will of the Lord, who hath laid it upon me, and hath assisted me in this undertaking, to write this Treatise, and direct it more perticularly unto you, and more generally to all the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> Teachers and People, both in <hi>New-England,</hi> or elsewhere, to whose Hands by divine Providence it shall come. And I require thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if in some places I seem to have appeared sharp unto you, or your Brethren, in this undertaking, I would have you to consider, that on a due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, my Arguments and Reasons are full as sharp as my Charges or Conclusions; and sharp <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Conclusions. And what sharpness or tartness, or seeming Severity I have used, true love and compassion to Souls, as well as zeal to God's Glory hath constrained it. Sweet potions of Physick are not always the most safe. The true Prophets of God were generally led and moved of God, to reprove sharply the false Prophets of Old. And Christ, and the Apostles, and other true Teachers, did sharply reprove false Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in that day; and there is the same cause now, and the same Spirit of Truth, and true Zeal now that moveth in God's true Servants in measure in this day. The precious Souls of many Thousands lie at stake, and therefore there ought to be plain dealing, and no daubing with untem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Morter, or sowing Pillows under Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes. I know the wrath of man doth not work the Righteousness of God, and I have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to keep free from that human Passion: and whether I have kept clear and free of it, I can, and do freely submit to the Judgment of the spiritual man, who hath a spiritual discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is able to judge; but to the carnal man's Judgment I have no reason to submit.

For ye take it for granted, that I bring another Doctrine, than the Doctrine of Christ and the Apostles, which I altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Secondly, what <hi>Iohn</hi> did write, was to a private Woman, and therefore doth not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate to you, who reckon your selves publick men, and Rulers as well as Teachers and Pastors in the Church; and I do not find any command or practice in all the Scripture for you to decline a fair Dispute with men, suppose Hereticks or false Teachers, unless ye have first dealt with them, in order to convince them: And even ye ought not to reject an Heretick, till after the first and second Admonition, according to Scripture, but ye never as yet gave me your first: And he who is an Heretick, is self-condemned, which I bless God, I am not; and ye pretend not to that spiritual discerning, whereby ye can know me to be such. It is not always one, nor divers Errors or mistakes in Judgment, that maketh men wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of that odious Name of <hi>Heretick.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Iohn,</hi> and all the other Apostles had the infallible Spirit of Truth, and that gave them a discerning infallibly to judge both Doctrines and Spirits; but this ye neither have, nor lay claim to: And yet we find that the Apostles did not shun to discourse and debate with men of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Principles, as occasion and season required. And Christ also did unweariedly reason with Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of all sorts, <hi>Iews, Pharisees, Sadducies,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Paul</hi> disputed daily in the School of <hi>Cyrannus,</hi> with them that opposed, and with <hi>Epicurians</hi> and <hi>Libertines,</hi> and others at <hi>Athens,</hi> &amp; went into the <hi>Iews</hi> Synagogues, &amp; reasoned with them; &amp; did not excuse themselves with your silly Evasion, that these men were false Teachers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be disputed with. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture commandeth, that in Meekness we should instruct them that oppose themselves, if God peradventure may give them Repentance. And though this is not the work of all private <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> who have not a publick Gift of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and are not called to that Work, yet this is no defence unto you, who pretend to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Teachers. And if it be so, that false Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers are on no account to be received into Houses, ye little consider how this Weapon may ere long be turned against your selves: For my hope is, that in due time, many People, both in <hi>Boston,</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> shall have their Eyes opened by the Spirit of the Lord, which ye blaspheme, to see your sort to be these false Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, who bring not the Doctrine of Christ and the Apostles, and the Houses ye Preach in, not being your Houses, but the Houses of the People, they shall not any more receive you into them, and this warrantably enough, according to your own words. But seeing ye are so unwilling that any called a <hi>Quaker,</hi> should come into your

It wanteth to be insert in his Book, that what hath befallen him of late, is a remarkable Judgment of God upon him, for his Injustice to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and his unjust charging the Innocent with the Crimes of the Guilty. Nor is his last Story, concerning one <hi>Robert Churchman,</hi> living at <hi>Balsham</hi> in <hi>Cambridge</hi>-Shire in Old <hi>England,</hi> related by <hi>H.

But it is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly and inhuman, as well as Unchristian, to charge these things upon the whole Profession. We have always asserted it, that it is one thing to profess to be led by the Spirit of God, and another thing to be really and in deed led by it. We are not ignorant how many have both said and done very bad things, under a pretence of being led by the Spirit of God, and of having the Spirit to be their Rule; and yet this is no Argument against the leading and rule of the Spirit of God, no more than it is an Argument against the Scripture, that many have done bad things, and pretended they have had the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be their Rule in what they did; as in the late Wars, in Old <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> when they rose up against the lawful Authority, wherein many both <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> were concerned, they all did pretend they had the Scripture to be their Rule in what they did;
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:000472_0234_0FA6752A004E6E20"/>
and yet surely, the Scripture was no Rule nor warrant unto them in these bad Practices. The leadings of the true Spirit of God are known, both by the first Motions, and also by the Effects and Fruits that follow after; and that is <hi>to deny all Vngodliness</hi> and <hi>Vnrighteousness,</hi> and <hi>to live Soberly,</hi> and <hi>Godly,</hi> and <hi>Righteo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
