            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>THE great deſign of religious worſhip, as inſtituted by the Moſt High, for the benefit of a revolted world of mankind, is, under its enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and transforming influence, to impreſs upon the mind a proper ſenſe of the glorious Deity; to aſſimilate mankind to a nearer reſemblance of the perfections of God, and hereby to qualify them for the final enjoyment of him.</p>

Divinely inſtituted worſhip, may be conſidered as a medium of intercourſe between the Supreme Author of all being, and his intelligent creatures; in and by which they manifeſt a ſenſe of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon him, their love, eſteem and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him; and by which the devout worſhipper on the wings of faith and prayer, aſcends to the throne of his grace, and receives the tokens of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love and favour, by an increaſe of the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of him, and fervour of affection towards him.</p>
                  <p>The ſelected paſſages of inſpiration may proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly direct our view and inquiry, with reſpect to the proper object and inſtitutor of all religious worſhip.</p>
                  <p>The manner in which acceptable worſhip is to be performed, both as it reſpects the Jewiſh relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, under the law, and the Chriſtian religion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the goſpel; as alſo the powerful motives af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to the devout worſhipper.</p>
                  <p>Anſwerable to the intereſting and important ends of religious worſhip, are the apprehenſions thereof manifeſted in my text.</p>
                  <p>Although theſe paſſages of inſpiration are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, at a diſtance, in the ſacred pages, yet they have a near relation to each other, as to the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant object to which they refer. The former paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage contains the pious breathings of King Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, who was the wiſeſt of all men: The latter are the words of one, greater than Solomon, the Prince of the kings of the earth, the Son of God, the Saviour of the world. The former paſſage di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects our views to that religious worſhip, enjoined by the God of Iſrael, upon his people, under the Jewiſh diſpenſation. The latter, to the more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual worſhip, enjoined upon all Chriſtians, under the goſpel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="unknown:028160_0004_0FD6D81C95326058"/>
I am, firſt, led to ſome obſervations reſpecting the religious worſhip, enjoined by God, upon his people, under the Jewiſh diſpenſation. In order to enable us, the better to underſtand the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and great propriety of the expreſſions, made uſe of by Solomon, in his invocation of the God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, it is to be obſerved that the temple built by Solomon (which, with regard to its curious work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, the richneſs of the materials of which it conſiſted, the overlayings of gold with which it was adorned, and the uſe and deſign for which it was, in all reſpects adapted) was the moſt extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and magnificent ſtructure, ever effected by human art. This temple being built by Solomon, according to divine appointment, at Jeruſalem, was to ſucceed the former uſe of the Tabernacle, which according to divine directions, given to Moſes, he had cauſed to be erected in the wilderneſs: In which were depoſited the Ark of God, the two ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the law, Aaron's Rod, and the pot of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na. In this Tabernacle the great Jehovah was pleaſed to vouchſafe his gracious preſence, in the viſible tokens and manifeſtations thereof, to Iſrael in the wilderneſs; guiding and directing their courſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and movements, by a pillar of cloud by day, and a pillar of fire, by night, which manifeſted itſelf over the Tabernacle, in which was the Ark of God. The motion and the reſt of the cloud gave the ſignal, when the children of Iſrael were to march forward, and when they were to pitch their tents. And we have it obſerved, that "when the Ark ſet forward, Moſes ſaid, Riſe up, Lord, and let thine enemies be ſcattered, and let them that hate thee flee before thee. And when it reſted, he
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028160_0005_0FD6D82152F71270"/>
ſaid, return, O Lord, unto the many thouſand's of Iſrael.<note n="*" place="bottom">Numb. x. 35, 36.</note> The Tabernacle was a moveable tent, while Iſrael journeyed in the wilderneſs; and was, as it were, the Palace of the Moſt High, the dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the God of Iſrael; in which the Iſraelites performed the chief of their religious exerciſes, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered their ſacrifices and worſhipped God. But the ſolemn worſhip of God was, for the future, to be performed at Jeruſalem." "For the Lord hath choſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Zion" He hath deſired it for his habitation: This is my reſt forever: Here will I dwell, for I have deſired it;"<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm cxxxii. 13, 14;</note>Referring to the city Jeruſalem, where was mount Zion, and mount Moriah, on which the Temple of Solomon was erected; in which for the future, the Ark of the God of Iſrael was to be fixed. The Ark was the ſymbol of God's powerful and glorious preſence, from which he was wont to put forth, and manifeſt his ſtrength, on the behalf of his people, when deſired, or need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them. The above obſervations may enable us the better, to apprehend the meaning, and great propriety of the expreſſions made uſe of, by Solomon, in the text.</p>
                  <p>Solomon having, at immenſe expenſe, and with exquiſite art, finiſhed and adorned the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, according to the directions of the Moſt High, to be the ſtated place for the ſolemn worſhip of God; he proceeds to notice the goodneſs of God, manifeſted in the promiſe made to David his father, and in the fulfilment thereof with reſpect to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; in his being ſeated in the kingdom, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing erected an houſe to the name of the Lord, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028160_0006_0FD6D8224DB56258"/>
having put therein the Ark, wherein was the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Lord which he made with Iſrael. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, king Solomon goes on to preſent his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent prayer, as expreſſed in the preceding part of the chapter; at the concluſion of which, he ſaith, as in my text: "Now therefore ariſe, O Lord God, into thy reſting place, thou and the Ark of thy ſtrength." As if he had ſaid, O Thou who ſitteſt in the heavens, ariſe from the throne of thy glory, and come down into this place, which thou haſt appointed for thy conſtant and fixed habitation; from which thou wilt not any more remove, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly thou haſt done, from place to, place: Thou and the Ark of thy ſtrength; or thou <hi>in</hi> the Ark of thy ſtrength, as it may be rendered.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt glory of the Temple was thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary marks of the divine favour with which it was honoured; <abbr>viz.</abbr>1. The Ark of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, in which were put the two Tables of the Law; and the Mercy-Seat, which was upon it; from whence the divine Oracles were given out, by an audible voice, as often as God was conſulted in behalf of his people. 2. The Shechinah, or the divine preſence, manifeſted by a viſible cloud, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the Mercy-Seat. 3. The Urim and Thummim, by which the High Prieſt conſulted God, in difficult caſes, relating to the public inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the nation. 4. The Holy Fire, which came down from heaven, at the conſecration of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Such were the ſignal, and viſible marks of the divine preſence in the Temple, for the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which, Solomon preſented his ſervent pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, at the conſecration of it. In anſwer to which, we have it expreſſed, as follows "Now when
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028160_0007_0FD6D8284EBF7B70"/>
Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and conſumed the burnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering and the ſacrifices, and the glory of the Lord filled the houſe."</p>
                  <p>From what is related, we learn the exalted ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the glorious Deity, which inſpired the breaſt of King Solomon, and ſhould animate the devotion of all true worſhippers.</p>
                  <p>The glorious Deity is the only proper object of all religious worſhip: And his people are forbid to worſhip any other God: And all true and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable worſhip is inſtituted by him." "In vain do ye worſhip me, ſays our Saviour to the Phariſees, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men."<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>Man who receives being and continual ſupport from the agency and pleaſure of the Moſt High, is obligated to perform all acts of religious worſhip to him, only in the manner which he hath preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; in obedience to his commands, and to promote his glory. And it is pertinent to obſerve, that the external mode preſcribed for the worſhip of God, has been different, in different periods of the church, under the Law, and under the Goſpel. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious inſtitutions enjoined upon the Jews, relating to the Temple ſervice, all their religious rites, had reference to the glorious Deity, as juſt and holy; and to mankind, in his lapſed ſtate, as ſinful and polluted. They repreſented God as reconcileable to ſinful man, who had broken covenant with God, his Maker; and that God becomes reconcileable, only, through a Mediator, agreeably to what was compriſed in that early promiſe, <hi>that the ſeed of the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028160_0008_0FD6D7F9CD4F3618"/>
woman ſhould bruiſe the Serpent's head.</hi> The rich bleſſings, included in this promiſe, have been grad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually unfolding, and ripening for complete fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from the early days of the Church. From the promiſe being firſt given out to Adam, this promiſe has engaged the faith, and animated the devotion of God's true Iſrael, in all ages of the Church. As men have ever been under an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to acknowledge the ſupreme dominion of God over them, and whatever belongs to them; and as there have always been found perſons, who have conſcientiouſly acquitted themſelves of this duty, it is probable that there have always been ſacrifices in the world. Adam and his ſons, Noah and his deſcendants, Abraham and his poſterity, Job and Melchizedec, before the Law, have offered to God real ſacrifices. But the Law aſcertained the quality, the number, and other circumſtances of the ſacrifices, which, before, were arbitrary. A great variety of laws, termed ceremonial and judicial, were given to Moſes, to be obſerved by the Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, in addition to the moral Law, which were limited, as to their obligation, to the Jewiſh Econ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omy; all of which had their uſes, and were wiſely adapted, by the righteous Law-giver, to anſwer the ends deſigned; many of which laws reſpected ſacrifices and pollutions, were typical, pointing out the pollutions of human nature, and the neceſſity of atonement. Thus the Temple itſelf, and the Ark, with other things contained in the Temple, the Mercy-Seat, the Altar, &amp;c. together with many of the ſacrifices and ſervices thereof, were typical of Chriſt and the Goſpel Church, which they were to precede and repreſent. All theſe ſacrifices were no

other than prophecies and figures of Chriſt Jeſus, the true Chriſtian ſacrifice; containing the whole ſubſtance, of which the ancient ſacrifices were but ſhadows and repreſentatives. Thus the Jewiſh Diſpenſation, although more obſcure than that of the Goſpel, was ſuch as the wiſdom of God ſaw fit to appoint, to go before, and prepare the way for the latter; and was ſufficient to fix the faith of the true worſhipper, in the promiſe of God, for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, juſtification, and eternal life, through Chriſt, the promiſed Meſſiah, of whoſe appearance here upon earth, they had longing expectation.

                  <p>Which leads me to ſhift our views from the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Diſpenſation, to that of the Goſpel, to the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and commencement of which happy era, the laſt branch of my text has a ſpecial reference.</p>
                  <p>"Jeſus ſaith unto her, woman believe me, the hour cometh, when ye ſhall, neither in this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, nor yet at Jeruſalem, worſhip the Father. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth; for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him."</p>
                  <p>The time having now arrived, when, according to the eternal purpoſe of grace, the types and prophecies which pointed out the coming of Chriſt, the true Meſſiah, ſhould have their fulfilment, by his actual advent; when all the ceremonial rites ſhould ceaſe, under the ſpiritual reign of Chriſt's kingdom; when the typical worſhip of the Jews ſhould be ſhifted, under Chriſt the great Antitype,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028160_0010_0FD6D82D963345F8"/>
to the more pure and ſpiritual Chriſtian worſhip: At the appointed time, and for theſe glorious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, Chriſt made his perſonal appearance here up on earth. Not with that external pomp and grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur which the Jews were led, vainly, to expect; but in the low and humble form of a ſervant. Not in a manner adapted to attract the admiration of the world, and gratify the ambitious expectation of the Jews, by freeing them from the Roman yoke, and conferring upon them the richeſt honours and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of this world; but as was propheſied of him, he appeared meek and lowly, to humble the pride of men, and to ſet up his ſpiritual kingdom in their hearts. To effect the benevolent deſign of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the world, Chriſt frequently introduced and mingled himſelf with perſons of different claſſes and characters; timing his diſcourſes and obſervations, as occaſion preſented, in ſuch a manner as was beſt adapted to excite their attention, and fix their faith in him, as the promiſed Meſſiah.</p>
                  <p>In the proſecution of the benevolent deſign, for which Chriſt came into the world, the Evangeliſt informs us, that, leaving Judea and going to Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee, he took occaſion to paſs through Samaria; that he came to a city of Samaria, which is called Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his ſon Joſeph, where was Jacob's well; and that he, being wearied with his journey, ſat upon the well; unto which there came a woman of Samaria, to draw water; which gave occaſion to the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between her and our Saviour, which proved the occaſion of her faith in him, and alſo the faith of many others: Our Saviour introduces his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, by aſking her to give him to drink. She
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028160_0011_0FD6D82FCB3191F0"/>
aſketh him, why he, being a Jew, aſked drink of her, being a woman of Samaria? Adding, that the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto her, if thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith unto thee, give me to drink, thou wouldeſt have aſked of him, and the would have given thee living water. Upon the converſation which followed ſhe was led to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him to be a prophet, and makes, to him, the following obſervation, by way of queſtion; our Saviour's anſwer to which, is contained in my text.</p>
                  <p>"Our Fathers, ſaith ſhe, worſhipped in this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and ye ſay, that in Jeruſalem is the place where men ought to worſhip." The mountain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to, was an exceeding high mountain, called Gerizim, near Sychem, near to which Jacob had, formerly, made an altar, Gen. xxxiii. 20; and from this mountain Moſes pronounced the bleſſings, Deut. xxvii.12. Mention is made, in the book of Nehemiah, that, according to the covenant expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Ezra x.3, of ſeparating, from the Iſraelites, thoſe who had married ſtrange wives, one of the ſons of Eliaſhib, the High Prieſt, who had married a daughter of Sanballat the Horonite, then Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor in Samaria, was therefore driven out from the congregation of Iſrael: But that by Sanballat's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, he obtained liberty to build a Temple at mount Gerizim; of which he was afterwards High Prieſt. To this Temple thoſe prieſts, and other Iſraelites, who had married ſtrange wives, or had been otherwiſe criminal, after that, reſorted. This Temple, ſtanding the ſpace of two hundred and twenty years, was afterwards deſtroyed. This was the place, where the Samaritans performed
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028160_0012_0FD6D83157D80100"/>
their religious worſhip, while the Temple was ſtanding, and alſo after it was deſtroyed; looking upon the ground as holy, they ſtill reſorted there for their devotion. With reference to this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious practice, the woman of Samaria ſaith, "our fathers worſhipped in this mountain." And the Jews held, that none might worſhip God, by ſacrifice, any where but at Jeruſalem, according to the law, Deut. xii. 14, 26. "Jeſus ſaith unto her, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man believe me, the hour cometh when ye ſhall, neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jeruſalem, worſhip the Father." The import of our Saviour's words may be underſtood as follows. Thou owneſt me as a prophet, whoſe office it is to reveal the will of God unto men. It is therefore thy duty to give credit to what I ſhall reveal to thee, about the true and right way of worſhipping God. The time is coming, yea, nigh at hand, when ye ſhall, neither in this mountain, Gerizim, where your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have ſo long worſhipped God ſuperſtitiouſly, without any direction from him, nor yet at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, which is the place he made choice of for his worſhip, worſhip of the Father. God is put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an end to both theſe places, and to all that worſhip which I ſhall not inſtitute, under the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. The hour was coming, when all difference of places, for God's worſhip, ſhould be taken away; ere long the ſervice of God ſhould not be confined to one place, more than another. "The hour cometh, and now is, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth; for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him." Our Saviour here inſtructed her concerning the worſhip itſelf; that the ceremonial worſhip, which the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028160_0013_0FD6D8336B1DA4B8"/>
Jews and Samaritans had uſed, ſhould ſhortly be aboliſhed, and inſtead thereof, a more ſpiritual form of worſhip ſhould be eſtabliſhed; more ſuitable to the ſpiritual nature of the Deity, and containing in it, the truth and ſubſtance of all that, which the Jewiſh ceremonies prefigured and ſhadowed forth.</p>
                  <p>The true worſhip of God, under the goſpel, doth not conſiſt in the external pomp of any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ceremonies. No worſhip is acceptable to him, who is the Father of Spirits, but that which is truly ſpiritual.</p>
                  <p>From the above comment upon theſe paſſages of inſpiration, ſeveral obſervations are ſuggeſted, for inſtruction and improvement.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The glorious Deity is the only proper object of all religious worſhip; whoſe perfections are, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably, the ſame, and equally merit the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme love and veneration of his worſhippers, in all ages of the church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That manner of worſhip only, is obligatory upon man, and acceptable to the Deity, which he himſelf hath inſtituted. God's prerogative, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſs, is manifeſted in inſtituting and preſcribing the means and manner by which he eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teems himſelf glorified, and to which the promiſe of his bleſſing is annexed. This is equally true, and to be acknowledged, as it reſpects thoſe laws termed ceremonial, under the Jewiſh adminiſtration, which were temporary, and that worſhip which is more ſpiritual, under the goſpel, which is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, during the ſtate of the church militant, here upon earth. And it is a daring affront to the divine Majeſty, to pay religious homage to any creature, or to worſhip God in any other way than he hath appointed. This is offering an inſult to his wiſdom.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:028160_0014_0FD6D8345563E808"/>
3. It will be the earneſt deſire, and prayer of the true worſhippers of God, that he would bleſs his people, in his own appointed way. This is a nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural inference from the prayer of Solomon, in my text. "Ariſe, O Lord God, into thy reſting place, thou and the Ark of thy ſtrength. Let thy prieſts, O Lord God, be clothed with ſalvation, and let thy ſaints rejoice in goodneſs." In this prayer of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omon, <hi>ſaints</hi> are particularly mentioned. Being <hi>clothed with ſalvation,</hi> may be underſtood as a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative expreſſion, alluding to thoſe prieſtly garments, appointed, for beauty and glory, to Aaron and his ſucceſſors in the prieſthood, under the law; point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the ornaments of righteouſneſs and true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; that ſo their perſons and ſervices might be accepted by God, both for themſelves and for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, that they may be encompaſſed on every ſide, with the divine protection and benediction. And let thy people have cauſe, at all times, to rejoice in thy goodneſs, imparted to them, in the ways of thine appointment. Such may be underſtood to be the language of this prayer of Solomon. The pious deſires of which his prayer is expreſſive, will agree with that ſpirit of benevolence, which the goſpel inculcates; and to the apoſtolic direction of doing good unto all men, as we have opportunity, eſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ially to them who are of the houſehold of faith. Such a temper is ſtrongly recommended by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and example of our ſaviour, who prayed for his cruciſiers, ſaying, "Father forgive them, for they know not what they do." And before his crucifixion, we find him putting up a prayer for his Apoſtles in particular, and after that, for all ſuch
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028160_0015_0FD6D835CD650FD8"/>
as ſhould believe on him, through their word.<note n="*" place="bottom">See John 17.</note> With ſuch a temper, will correſpond the prayers and deſires of all true worſhippers. They will ſeek for a bleſſing, in God's appointed way, by attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon inſtituted worſhip, in a regular way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, looking to God, through the Mercy-Seat, that is, through the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, the giver of every good and perfect gift: Like new born babes, deſiring the ſincere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby: Seeking it from the prieſts' lips, which are to preſerve knowledge; who are honoured with the title of Chriſt's ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, proclaiming the glad tidings of ſalvation, and publiſhing the goſpel of peace.</p>
                  <p>Among the enlargement of privileges, under the goſpel, beyond thoſe, enjoyed under the Jewiſh Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, one to be noticed by us is, that the relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious difference of places is now taken away, and the worſhip of God not confined to any one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar place or nation. According to the dictates of human wiſdom, ſuch places for religious and ſocial worſhip, are now to be preferred, as, on account of local ſituation, and comfortable accommodations, afford the greateſt convenience for attending, with frequency and regularity: that the public worſhip, in which all are equally intereſted, may be by all enjoyed, with equal conveniency, as far as it can be effected. Both the dictates of reaſon and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the goſpel point out this rule, for the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of our conduct in appointing places, and erecting convenient buildings for public worſhip.</p>
                  <p>And I charitably conceive that ſuch have been the governing motives for the voluntary expenſe of erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028160_0016_0FD6D837E7684990"/>
a houſe for public worſhip, in this place. May Chriſtian edification, peace, and advancement in ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery Chriſtian virtue, be the happy fruits and effects both to them and their poſterity. In order to which, let every one labour to be of ſuch a character as the Father ſeeketh to worſhip him. From ſpiritual principles; with ſincere love, and filial reverence; for ſpiritual ends, to pleaſe him, and to promote his glory, with the whole heart, mind, and ſoul. The Jewiſh ceremonial worſhip was aboliſhed, to promote the ſpirituality of divine worſhip. Yet it is not to be underſtood, as if God rejected all bodily worſhip, becauſe he requires ſpiritual, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the goſpel. For Jeſus Chriſt, the moſt ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual worſhipper, worſhipped God with his body. God has appointed ſome parts of worſhip, which cannot be performed without the body; ſuch as ſacraments. In a word, God has created the body as well as the ſoul; and Chriſt has redeemed the body as well as the ſoul; therefore it is our duty, to worſhip and glorify God, with our body and ſpirit which are his.</p>
                  <p>May we all be led to greater advancement in the knowledge of God, and our duty, and to worſhip him, in a more acceptable manner; be formed into a nearer reſemblance of his moral character; expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience an increaſe of love and veneration towards him, and become qualified for the full enjoyment of him, in the manſions of eternal glory. Let us all, in our approaches to God in the way of worſhip, diveſt ourſelves of all unworthy thoughts and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the Deity, as conſiſting of any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal parts, or any ſuch paſſions or affections as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate change or imperfection; and conſider him as a pure, intelligent ſpirit, whom the heaven of heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028160_0017_0FD6D838C8A8B490"/>
cannot contain, who is ever preſent with us, and ſearcheth the inmoſt receſſes of our hearts, who cannot be deceived, and who will not be mocked; who, though perfectly independent of any of our ſervices, yet is graciouſly pleaſed to view with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation the devout worſhipper, who worſhippeth him in ſpirit and in truth; but views with diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and abhorrence, the falſe adulation of the hypocrite. "He that offereth praiſe, glorifieth me, ſaith the Lord, by the mouth of the Pſalmiſt, and to him that ordereth his converſation aright, will I ſhew the ſalvation of God." Let us in all acts of religious exerciſe, conſider with whom it is we have to do—an infinitely holy God. And as we are conſcious in ourſelves, of being ſinful and guilty, and thereby unworthy the preſence of an holy God, let us approach him, in the worthy name of Chriſt, the only mediator, with adoring apprehenſions of the divine goodneſs, in the gift of his ſon Jeſus Chriſt; in whoſe name we are encouraged to come, with boldneſs, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in every time of need. Ample encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement is given to the devout worſhipper of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining grace here, and glory hereafter. Let his ſaints therefore rejoice in goodneſs. May we, each one, have our hearts filled with gratitude, and our tongues with praiſe; and with ſincerity of heart, may we ſay, with the Pſalmiſt, "I was glad when they ſaid unto me, we will go into the houſe of the Lord: Our feet ſahll ſtand within thy gates, O Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem."</p>
                  <p>May <hi>this houſe,</hi> devoted to religious worſhip, be always approached with joy and gladneſs, and with proper ſolemnity, remembering that <hi>this is none
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028160_0018_0FD6D83C07134F50"/>
other than the houſe of God, and the gate of heaven.</hi> Let every unhallowed thought, word, and action be ſtrictly guarded againſt and ſuppreſſed remembering that holineſs becomes God's houſe forever. The glorious Deity, the proper object of all religious worſhip, is preſent in worſhipping aſſemblies, to notice with what hearts his people approach him; and will command his bleſſing upon the devout wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper who worſhippeth him in ſpirit and in truth, even life forevermore. If you thus ſeek and ſerve the Lord, he will be found of you; but if you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, he will caſt you off forever.</p>
                  <p>When Solomon had ended his prayer, at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of the temple, the Lord appeared to him, by night, and ſaid unto him, I have heard thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and have choſen this place to myſelf, for an houſe of ſacrifice. And God graciouſly promiſed, that upon their ſeeking and ſerving him, in a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he would hear the prayers which ſhould be made in that houſe, and judgments ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. "If my people which are called by my name, ſhall humble themſelves, and pray, and ſeek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their ſins, and will heal their land. But if ye turn away and forſake my ſtatues, &amp;c, then will I pluck them up, and this houſe ſhall be a proverb, and a by-word among all nations."</p>
                  <p>May we not then, my hearers, with tranſports of joy, anticipate the bleſſings which may be derived from the Father of mercies, to the true worſhippers, in this houſe of the preſent and future generations? For which end, may the worſhip of God ever be duly performed, and attended to, in it: Peace and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028160_0019_0FD6D83F30E74598"/>
concord be ever promoted and cultivated in every heart, and the religion of the Redeemer here flouriſh. Then may the bleſſing be experienced as expreſſed, in Pſalm 133rd, "I will abundantly bleſs her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion; I will fill her poor with bread: I will alſo clothe her prieſts with ſalvation and her ſaints ſhall ſhout aloud for joy."</p>
                  <p>By way of concluſion. As we have begun the year this day, with religious exerciſe, may we, each one, perſerve in religious virtue: that ſo it may prove, indeed, a happy year to each of us. For which end, let us unite in our petitions at the throne of grace, in the language of Solomon, in my text..</p>
                  <p>"Now therefore ariſe, O Lord God, into thy reſting place, thou, and the Ark of thy ſtrength; Let thy prieſts, O Lord God, be clothed with ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and let thy ſaints rejoice in goodneſs."</p>

                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>PSALM xxvi. 8.</bibl>
                     <q>"<hi>Lord I have loved the habitation of thy houſe, and the place where thine honour dwells.</hi>"</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THE Pſalmiſt, in this pſalm, is pleading his integrity before God, and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his heart with the conſciouſneſs of his upright endeavours to walk in the way of piety and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>He appeals to the Searcher of hearts, for the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of his affection towards him, and deſire to pleaſe him. "Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; try my reins and my heart; for thy loving kindneſs is before mine eyes, and I have walked in thy truth." He proceeds to declare that he had made uſe of prudence and caution, to preſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf pure, and keep himſelf out of the way of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in avoiding intimacy with thoſe, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample might be enſnaring. "I have not ſat with
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028160_0022_0FD6D84B41BBAA20"/>
vain perſons, neither will I go in with diſſemblers; I have hated the congregation of evil doers, and will not ſit with the wicked." The duties of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and devotion he conſidered as an important part of the ſervice due from a man to his Maker, without attention to which the human character muſt be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially defective. He was ſenſible on the other hand, that devotion without purity and moral virtue, could never be acceptable to a holy God; and that an outward compliance with the duties of religion, without the homage and affection of the heart, is but like a body without a ſoul, a ſhadow without the ſubſtance. Theſe ideas appear to be ſuggeſted by the following expreſſions. "I will waſh my hands in innocency, ſo will I compoſs thine altar, O Lord; that I may publiſh with the voice of thankſgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works. <hi>I have loved the habitation of thy houſe, and the place where thine hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our dwells.</hi> The meaning and reaſon of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions made uſe of in the text, may be explained by the following obſervations.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>houſe of the Lord,</hi> to which the pſalmiſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, muſt be the Tabernacle, erected originally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the particular directions of God himſelf, in the wilderneſs, but rebuilt, as it ſeems, by David, in the city of Jeruſalem, after the Ark of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which had been taken by the Philiſtines, was returned, and with ſolemn pomp placed in that city. For we read that "they brought in the Ark of the Lord, and ſet it in his place, in the midſt of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it.<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Samuel vi.17.</note> This was called <hi>the habitation of God's houſe,</hi> becauſe it
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028160_0023_0FD6D84C47BD9CF8"/>
was erected for his worſhip, and becauſe it was the place where the choſen people were taught to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his peculiar preſence; the place where he gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly vouchſafed to dwell. Thus it is ſaid, "The Lord hath choſen Zion; he hath deſired it for his habitation: This is my reſt forever; here will I dwell."<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm cxxxii. 13, 14.</note> And again, "In Salem alſo is his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, and his dwelling place in Zion."<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm lxxvi. 2.</note> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the Pſalmiſt further deſcribes the Tabernacle, or the houſe of the Lord, by the following words in the text, <hi>the place where his honour dwells.</hi> It was there that the Lord occaſionally manifeſted, in a viſible manner, his glory; and thence he regularly gave forth his oracles. It was before the Ark that the prieſts were to inquire the mind of the Lord, and receive their directions from him. As God was in a peculiar ſenſe the <hi>King</hi> of the Jews: As he was their immediate Sovereign; ſo the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle was conſidered as his <hi>Palace,</hi> the place of his ſtated reſidence, and the Mercy-Seat as his <hi>Throne.</hi> Therefore he is ſaid to <hi>dwell between the Cherubims.</hi> But as he was their God, as well as their king, ſo the Tabernacle was a Temple as well as a Palace, and here the people offered their worſhip to him, as well as received their orders and directions from him. And it is in this latter view eſpecially, that houſes now dedicated to the ſervice of God, reſemble the Tabernacle or Temple of old.</p>
                  <p>The example of David in his affection for God's houſe, is moſt worthy our imitation. Let us now conſider,

                  <p>I. When we ſpeak of his example as applicable to ourſelves; loving the habitation of God's houſe, is loving the public worſhip of God, wherever it may be performed. His worſhip is not now confined to a particular houſe, or a ſingle city; but wherever ſincere worſhippers aſſemble, there is a houſe for God. This is the nature and genius of the diſpenſation under which we live; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

The period in which a leſs confined, and more ſpiritual worſhip was to take place. For he proceeds to ſay, by way of explanation: The hour cometh, and now is, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth."<note n="*" place="bottom">John iv.21 and 23.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true however, in the Chriſtian world, as well as among the Jews, that worſhipping aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies are ordinarily held in houſes erected for the purpoſe; and which, though not entirely confined to this uſe, are ſo much devoted to it, that it may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impropriety or ſuperſtition be ſaid, that they are dedicated to God.</p>
                  <p>The Temples of the Heathens, as well as the Temple of the Jews at Jeruſalem, were magnificent, coſtly buildings: And they were held in a kind and degree of veneration, which is not common, and which we do not ſay would be proper, among Chriſtians. Chriſtians indeed are far from being all alike in this reſpect. Churches in ſome parts
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028160_0025_0FD6D85854B22FF0"/>
of Chriſtendom, are built and ornamented with a profuſion of expenſe, which humanity might well wiſh had been beſtowed, in part at leaſt, for ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wants of the poor, and alleviating the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of the miſerable. They have owed much of their magnificence to ſuperſtition; yet ſtill I may ſay, they have owed not a little of it to a natural and rational veneration of the Deity, worſhipped therein. If it be an error to beſtow great labour and expenſe on buildings dedicated to God, it ſeems to be an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror not unnatural or unpardonable. The mind will not readily oppoſe, or attempt to confuſe ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning as follows. Should not mankind ſerve and honour the Deity with their beſt? Should not ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing be great and noble, or excellent in its kind, that is dedicated to the ſervice of the greateſt and beſt of beings, the INFINITE MAJESTY OF HEAV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EN? What building ſhould be more firm and durable, than that which is erected to the honour of the ETERNAL GOD? Or what can the labours of the moſt ingenious artiſts; the higheſt efforts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſkill, be more worthily beſtowed, than on the Temples of the SUPREME ARCHITECT, who is wonderful in counſel, and excellent in working? Why the beauty and elegance of houſes dedicated to the worſhip of God, ſhould not keep pace with the increaſe of wealth and refinement among a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and their ability to improve and ornament their own houſes, perhaps no good reaſon, can be given. This at leaſt may be ſaid, that reaſon, if not religion, teaches us to render houſes for religious aſſembling, commodious and comfortable. To ſpare the pains and expenſe neceſſary for this, would betray a want of due regard to ourſelves, our own
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028160_0026_0FD6D85B4CA60D68"/>
caſe, health, and convenience, or an unbecoming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differenceas to the public worſhip of God; and ſhew, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we were willing to be needleſly incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in God's houſe, or be furniſhed with an excuſe for abſenting ourſelves from it.</p>
                  <p>But to return. To love the habitation of God's houſe, you will readily conceive is not merely or principally to take delight in, or ſet our hearts upon the <hi>building</hi> itſelf, however commodious or elegant, but to love the worſhip which is performed there. It is to take pleaſure in drawing near to God in a public, ſocial manner, and coming before him <hi>as his people come.</hi> It muſt herefore imply an uniform deſire and endeavour to be preſent at, and join in the ſolemnities of public worſhip. They who love the habitation of God's houſe, may be ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced that they cannot frequently join the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of his people therein: But they who can, and yet do not, ever, or but very ſeldom, attend, can hardly be ſuppoſed to have that affection for his houſe and worſhip, which the Pſalmiſt expreſſed. If men's hearts be there, they will endeavour to be there alſo. Providence may often diſappoint their wiſhes; but if they ſeek excuſes for abſenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or are ſatisfied with ſuch as are very trifling, there is too much reaſon to fear that their hearts are not right, and that they are either indifferent to, or averſe from the public worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that perſons may attend, and love, or be attached to, the worſhip of God's houſe for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have nothing to do with religion. It may therefore be obſerved that the love which the Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt's example recommends, is founded on pure and worthy principles. The good man does not love God's houſe, or attend his worſhip therein, merely
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028160_0027_0FD6D85DAFAB5E80"/>
becauſe he is accuſtomed to ſuch attendance, though this may be the means of ſtrengthening his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it. He attends, not becauſe it is reputable, and exhibits a good example; though I do not ſay it would be beſt for a man to abſent himſelf, if he had no higher views than theſe, ſince, to ſay noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the poſſibility of his being perſonally benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the appointed means of grace, his attendance might be beneficial to others: Not that he may have an opportunity for tranſacting worldly buſineſs with his neighbours; for this is by no means the deſign of our meeting together: Not that he may have agreeable exerciſe on the day of reſt, or avoid the tediouſneſs of confinement at home; though it reflects honour on the divine inſtitutions, and illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates their wiſdom and benevolence, to obſerve, that one part of the duty of the Lord's day has a tendency to render the others more agreeable. But he loves, and viſits, when in his power, the houſe of God, becauſe he conceives that there <hi>men ought to worſhip,</hi> that aſſembling for ſocial worſhip is a very important part of the duty of the Lord's day; and the giving of opportunity for it, a very diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed end in ſeparating, and hallowing the day. He conſcientiouſly attends, becauſe he conſiders it as an appointed and valuable means of moral and religious improvement, and hopes to be benefited, and contribute to the benefit of others, by joining them in doing homage to their common Lord, praiſing their common Benefactor, ſeeking to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their religious knowledge, and in having their various duties explained to them, or inculcated upon them.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="10" facs="unknown:028160_0028_0FD6D8622911B3D0"/>
2. That he thinks juſtly: That attending pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip is a duty incumbent on Chriſtians; or that we are under obligation to imitate the Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt's example, we ſhall have no reaſon to doubt if we du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider the deſign of the inſtitution, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of it, or what the ſcriptures teach us relative to this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>It is an almoſt undiſputed dictate of reaſon that we ought to worſhip God: That we ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our dependence upon him; thank him for his favours; commit ourſelves to his protection, and ſeek his favour and bleſſing. The external worſhip of him is no more than expreſſing and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, thoſe ſentiments of fear, love, reverence, gratitude, confidence, and hope, which are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly fit in beings, related to him, and dependent upon him as we are. As we are ſocial beings, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial or united acknowledgements are properly offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him. We have common and public bleſſings to be thankful for, as well as common wants to be ſupplied; and therefore it ſeems right and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we ſhould give thanks, and offer up our petitions, in a public, as well as in a private man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Beſides, in the former way only can we ſo clearly manifeſt to others, our regard and reverence for the Deity. In this way he is more highly hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured as the Almighty Sovereign, Lord of heaven and earth. We moſt effectually do him homage, and ſhew forth his glory, when we praiſe him <hi>in the great congregation,</hi> and in the ſanctuary, <hi>talk of all his wondrous works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the propriety of public religious aſſemblies, and our obligation to attend them, will further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we conſider that the deſign of them is, not
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028160_0029_0FD6D865C15C6380"/>
merely that we may pray and praiſe, but that we may hear the truth of God's word; may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and exhorted, and by preaching have our minds enlightened or quickened in the knowledge of divine things. The importance and advantage of the public ſtated teaching of religion and moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity will hardly be denied by any ſerious, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate perſon; by any who attend to themſelves, or to the ſtate of the world around them. The manifeſt utility of ſuch an inſtitution, would afford a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal inducement to all thoſe who wiſh well to the intereſts of mankind, cheerfully to comply with it, were it only of human origin. But its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin is divine. Revelation confirms our reaſoning on this ſubject; and in the ſcriptures we may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read our obligation to frequent and love the hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation of God's houſe, and the place where his hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our dwells. Although we are not bound to obey the directions and commands given to the Jews, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> and which were of an appropriate or local nature, yet from its being enjoined on them by God, to worſhip him in a ſocial, public manner, and the form of their worſhip being ſo particularly preſcribed, we may at leaſt juſtly infer that public worſhip is fit and proper in itſelf, and agreeable to the will of the Deity; for elſe he would never have enjoined it, in any form, upon any people. Nor can it be truly ſaid that we have no warrant for it in the New Teſtament, and under the Chriſtian Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation. Our Saviour frequented the ſynagogues, and thus gave his countenance to that kind of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, before his own kingdom was ſo eſtabliſhed as to ſuperſede or aboliſh it. He prayed with his own diſciples: He preached himſelf: He ſent them out
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028160_0030_0FD6D8674F5C1160"/>
to preach: And he ſaid, "where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them."<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xviii. 20.</note> We find that the diſciples, after Chriſt's aſcenſion, worſhipped together: That they "all continued, with one accord, in prayer and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication:"<note n="†" place="bottom">Acts i. 14.</note> That "they continued ſteadfaſtly in the apoſtle's doctrine and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts ii. 42.</note> We find alſo that when the number of the diſciples was increaſed, and the goſpel ſpread into various regions, particular ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties were formed in different places, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of aſſembling and performing the ſeveral acts of Chriſtian worſhip and communion. Theſe were ſtiled Churches, and had Elders ordained in them reſpectively. That it was the practice, in thoſe early times, for Chriſtians to meet together, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious purpoſes, at leasſt on the firſt day of the week, or Lord's day, we are taught by the two following expreſſions made uſe of by the apoſtle, taken in connexion with the paſſages afterwards mentioned. "If therefore the whole church be come together in one place;"<note n="▪" place="bottom">1 Cor. xiv. 23.</note> and "when ye come together in the church."<note n="‖" place="bottom">ii. 18.</note> We read of the collection for the poor being made on the firſt day of the week, which is juſtly ſuppoſed to imply the aſſembling of the church on that day.<note n="¶" place="bottom">See xvi. 1, 2.</note> More expreſsly, we read of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <hi>coming together on the firſt day of the week, to break bread,</hi> as of ſomething well known and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary, and of Paul's preaching among them on the occaſion.<note n="**" place="bottom">Acts xx. 7.</note> And finally, that this meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for public worſhip, was conſidered as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028160_0031_0FD6D868C795E118"/>
of great importance, and not lightly to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with, we are taught by the exhortation given to Chriſtians, <hi>not to forſake the aſſembling of themſelves together, as the manner of ſome was.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. x. 27.</note> From the connexion in which this caution or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation ſtands, we are led to conclude that thus forſaking the public aſſemblies was viewed as a virtual giving up their profeſſion, and apoſtatizing from the faith. This doubtleſs we may ſet down for a truth, that to the inſtitution of public religious aſſemblies, and its having been generally complied with in the Chriſtian world, the preſervation of Chriſtianity to the preſent day is, under God, to be eſpecially attributed.</p>
                  <p>General inferences from, and reflections upon what has been ſaid, muſt give place to ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional obſervations as have an aſpect on the reaſon and circumſtances of our preſent aſſembling.</p>
                  <p>It is with a view eſpecially to the convenience of meeting together for public worſhip, not only that particular churches conſiſt of ſuch as inhabit the ſame vicinity, but that the civil diviſions into towns and pariſhes have been eſtabliſhed among us. In forming and proportioning the latter more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, it has been an object to have them contain no more people than might conveniently aſſemble at the ſame houſe. As the inhabitants of our country have become more numerous, new towns and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhes have been erected, and old ones divided, as the increaſed numbers and ability of the people, or oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er changes in their ſituation, have dictated. And ſometimes, even before the population and wealth of a pariſh is judged adequate to the conſtant ſupport of two worſhipping aſſemblies, and two public
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028160_0032_0FD6D8746711ADB0"/>
teachers of religion, the local circumſtances of a large portion of the ſociety may be ſuch, as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an imperfect diviſion expedient. Such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances have prompted to the building of <hi>this houſe,</hi> in which for the firſt time, a worſhipping aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly is held this day.<note n="*" place="bottom">A conſiderable part of the inhabitants of Yarmouth, not far from one third, live near the fourth ſhore of the town, at the diſtance of four miles and upwards from the meeting houſe, on the north ſide, where they have hitherto attended public worſhip. By their ſucceſs in the fiſhery, which is flouriſhing and increaſing among them, they have been enabled and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to each the houſe referred to; in which it is their expectation, in conſequence of previous arrangements made, that the preſent miniſter of the town, will preach a certain proportion of the time, to be agreed upon by the inhabitants at large.</note> We hope and truſt that they for whoſe benefit it is more eſpecially intended, have been actuated in building it by a ſincere regard to the honour of that God, to whoſe ſervice it is now dedicated. Is it not becauſe they <hi>have loved the habitation of God's houſe, and the place where his hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our dwells;</hi> becauſe they wiſh to have it in their power more frequently to tread his courts, than oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwiſe they could, that this commodious edifice now ſtands, thus far complete, in the midſt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? We know not of any reaſon to ſuppoſe that party views, or any unbecoming ſpirit, have operated to produce what we ſee this day. We do not conſider it as ſetting up altar againſt altar, but as a peaceable and well meant attempt more fully to accommodate one and the ſame religious ſociety: deſirous to continue the ſame, unleſs Providence ſhould in ſome future time, point out the propriety of a complete ſeparation, and forming two diſtinct worſhipping aſſemblies.</p>
                  <p>We congratulate you on the proſpect which is now preſented, of your being able more generally
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028160_0033_0FD6D8764A169888"/>
and conveniently, with your families and your little ones, to appear before the Lord in his houſe of prayer. And if your paſtor, with a view to your convenience and greater edification, is willing to be in labours more abundant than he had reaſon origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to expect, muſt not his people eſteem him more highly in love, for his work's ſake, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully miniſter to his ſupport and comfort, as reaſon and equity ſhall dictate?</p>
                  <p>And now, brethren, ſuffer the word of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Take heed unto yourſelves, as well as duly regard him who is over you in the Lord. Forſake not the aſſembling of yourſelves together. Expoſe not yourſelves to the imputation of undervaluing an important privilege, becauſe the enjoyment of it may be procured with leſs difficulty and exertion than heretofore. Be thankful unto him who <hi>giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the power to get wealth,</hi> that, by proſpering your in that buſineſs which ſeems to be aſſigned to you by Providence, he is enabling you, with greater caſe and convenience, to enjoy the benefit of public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for yourſelves and your families. It is to your honour that your have been diſpoſed to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the ſervice of your heavenly Benefactor, ſuch a portion of the fruits of your increaſe. But forget not the indiſpenſible obligation you are under to <hi>give your ownſelves alſo unto the Lord.</hi> The pure and holy heart is the temple in which he eſpecially delights to dwell. Let your neal for the worſhip of God, be rendered acceptable to him by your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and aſſiduous obedience unto all his commands.

                  <p>The leading object of the diſcourſe which you have heard, (I now addreſs myſelf to this whole aſſembly,) has been, to recommend an affectionate and rationally zealous regard to the worſhip of God's houſe.

But let us not forget, that the ſtricteſt attendance on the public worſhip of God, and the moſt ſcrupulous obſervance even of all the external parts of religion, will not alone for the neglect of thoſe virtues which are ſtyled, by our Lord himſelf, <hi>the weightier matters of the law;</hi> will not avail us without a vital principle of relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and goodneſs in our hearts, which ſhall manifeſt

itſelf in a holy life and converſation. If while we apparently delight to draw nigh unto God in the ways of his appointment, we really diſregard his authority, and caſt his laws behind us, we may well expect that he will turn away, with abhorrence, from our hypocritical oblations, and, ſeverely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating, ſay unto us, as to the perverſe and wicked among his people of old, "What haſt thou to do to declare my ſtatutes, or that thou ſhouldeſt take my covenant into thy mouth?" Let all be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded ſeriouſly to recollect and conſider how they have received and heard, hold faſt that which is good, and repent of all their paſt miſimprovement of the privileges which they have enjoyed.</p>
                  <p>To ſuch ſelf-examination, ſhould we not be led, not only by the <hi>occaſion,</hi> but by the <hi>time</hi> of our preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent aſſembling? Through the goodneſs of our al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Preſerver and Benefactor, we are brought to the beginning of another <hi>year;</hi> a diviſion of time which bears no inconſiderable proportion to the life of man, when protracted to its greateſt length; and which includes the whole earthly exiſtence of great multitudes that are born into the world. Thoſe congratulations, and wiſhes for each other's happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which mark this <hi>firſt day</hi> of the year, are not more common, than they are natural. But is it leſs natural or proper to diſtinguiſh this day, by offering the tribute of heart-felt gratitude to him who is the length of our days, the health of our counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and the author of all our mercies? Ought it not alſo to be a day of ſolemn recollection? While we pauſe to conſider how many of the years, commonly allotted to man, are, with reſpect to us, paſſed and gone, ſhall we not at the ſame time inquire in what manner they have paſſed, and how far they
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028160_0036_0FD6D8856C37E2A0"/>
have been improved to moral and religious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, or in forwarding the great and all-important and of our exiſtence? While we erect our monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of gratitude, and ſay "hitherto the Lord hath helped us," ſhall we not be abaſed before him on account of our former neglect, our follies and vices; and filled with ſhame and regret that ſo much of our lives has been ſpent in vain, or worſe than in vain, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, yet ſtead faſtly reſolve that, for the time to come, we will conduct ourſelves in a manner more becoming our profeſſions, our obligations, and our hopes?</p>
                  <p>By delaying to ſecure the favour and friendſhip of the Supreme, we riſk the loſs of every thing, that, comparatively ſpeaking, deſerves our care, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or purſuit. We know not what a day, much leſs what a year, may bring forth. The preſent time is all that we can juſtly call our own. To-day, therefore, while it is called to-day, let us all attend to the things of our everlaſting peace. From hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth let us labour to glorify God, in body and in ſpirit, which are his; and by practically loving him, as well as his houſe, and ſacredly regarding his will, at all times, and in all places, earneſtly and with perſerverance, ſeek preparation for, and a final in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND CHURCH OF THE FIRST-BORN, WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN HEAVEN.</p>
