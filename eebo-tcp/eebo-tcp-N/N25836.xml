            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>FACTS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>FROM the firſt appearance, in this city, of the contagious malignant, peſtilential or yellow fever, in 1793, the College of Phyſicians, agreeably to the principles of their inſtitution, ſanctioned by a charter from the legiſlature in 1789, have uſed their beſt endeavours to check the progreſs and to guard againſt the future introduction of this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful calamity. To the repeated applications made to them, by the different departments of the ſtate government on the ſubject, they have ever paid a prompt and reſpectful attention, and they now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it a duty incumbent on them to publiſh a conciſe detail of their former proceedings, and to explain more fully their ſentiments on the nature, origin and prevention of this fatal diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:034355_0003_0FFA6C8C01D5DD28"/>About the latter end of July and beginning of Auguſt 1793, a fever of a new and very alarming nature prevailed in this city. It firſt appeared in Water ſtreet, between Mulberry and Saſſafras ſtreets, and all the caſes of this fever, were, for two or three weeks evidently traced to this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſpot. A conſiderable part of the city, North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Liberties and diſtrict of Southwark became gradually infected, and it was not until the coming of the froſt, that the diſeaſe ſubſided, after having proved fatal to nearly five thouſand perſons.</p>
            <p>The peculiarity of the ſymptoms, the remarkable inefficacy of remedies generally uſed for diſeaſes which commonly occur in the ſame ſeaſon of the year, with ſomewhat ſimilar ſymptoms, its great mortality and contagious nature, ſufficiently evinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that a very unuſual diſeaſe exiſted amongſt us; which was ſoon diſcovered to be what is called the Siam, in the French, and the Yellow Fever in the Britiſh Weſt Indies.</p>
            <p>The College met on the 25th day of Auguſt to conſider what was neceſſary for them to do on the occaſion, and next day ſent to the Mayor of the city, <q>Directions for preventing the further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the malignant fever,</q> which were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:034355_0004_0FFC2359270F5808"/>
Theſe directions may be ſeen at large in a pamphlet entitled, <q>Proceedings of the College of Phyſicians of Philadelphia, relative to the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the introduction and ſpreading of conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſeaſes,</q> publiſhed in January 1798, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a regular account of all that had been done by the College on the occaſion. A copy of this publication was ſent to every member of the fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſtate legiſlatures, and of the ſelect and common council of the city. Theſe directions plainly ſhew that the College regarded the diſeaſe as highly contagious and malignant.</p>
            <p>On the fifth day of November a letter was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Governor of the ſtate, requeſting information of the origin of the diſeaſe, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions beſt calculated to prevent its recurrence, and the proper means to be purſued to purify the city from latent infection. The College entered into a careful inquiry on this ſubject, and although they met with many difficulties in the inveſtigation, difficulties which generally occur on ſuch occaſions, and the ſolution of which would criminate thoſe perſons who are more immediately concerned, and who are the beſt qualified to give the neceſſary accounts, yet they obtained ſufficient information to offer the following anſwer to the Governor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:034355_0005_0FFC23570833DA80"/>
               <q>No inſtance has ever occurred, of the diſeaſe called the Yellow Fever, being generated in this city, or in any other part of this ſtate, as far as we know; but there have been frequent inſtances of its having been imported, not only into this, but into other parts of North America, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing there for a certain period of time; and from the riſe, progreſs and nature of the malignant fever, which began to prevail here about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of laſt Auguſt, and extended itſelf gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally over a great part of the city, we are of opinion, that this diſeaſe was imported into Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia by ſome of the veſſels which arrived in the port after the middle of July. This opinion we are further confirmed in by the various ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts we have received from the beſt authorities we could procure on the ſubject.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The College alſo informed the Governor of the beſt means to purify the city from latent infection, and offered their ſervices to co-operate with the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature in their endeavours to prevent, avert or remove theſe dangerous calamities.</p>
            <p>On the ſecond day of December 1794, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the College was appointed to conſider the defects in the health-laws and to point out a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:034355_0006_0FFC23531FD56618"/>
remedy. On the report of this committee it was reſolved, that a memorial on the ſubject ſhould be preſented to the ſtate legiſlature, which was done accordingly, January 26th, 1795. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal objects of this memorial were, a requeſt that medical characters might be appointed to aſſiſt the conſulting phyſician of the port to prevent the ſpreading of contagious diſeaſes when introduced amongſt us, and to authorize them to remove the diſeaſed and thoſe expoſed to contagion. Alſo that they ſhould be conſulted reſpecting the quarantine and purification of veſſels, and the conſtruction and regulation of the city hoſpital.</p>
            <p>So much attention was paid to this memorial that the legiſlature, in the new health-law, paſſed this ſeſſion, empowered the Governor to appoint four perſons, members of the College, to aſſiſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting phyſician as recommended, who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly appointed in Auguſt following, and were invited to hold one meeting with the Board of Health; but another law was paſſed the ſucceeding ſeſſion which excluded them from any further ſhare in the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>About the latter end of July 1797, the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant contagious fever again appeared in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia:
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034355_0007_0FFC234F9152EBD8"/>
and on the fifteenth of Auguſt a letter was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Governor requeſting information concerning its exiſtence, and <q>an opinion on the beſt mode of preventing the calamity threatened.</q> The College immediately directed, their Preſident to inform the Governor that ſuch a diſeaſe had lately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Penn-ſtreet and its neighbourhood, and on the ſeventeenth of the month, in a letter to the Governor, gave their opinion of the beſt mode of averting the threatened calamity, by firſt, preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the methods for preventing the ſpreading of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious diſeaſes when introduced, and ſecondly, by preventing their introduction.</p>
            <p>To attain the firſt of theſe purpoſes, they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended ſtrict attention to cleaning and watering the ſtreets, habits of temperance, attention to cloathing, exerciſe, &amp;c. to avoid intercourſe with the ſick, and to purify places ſuſpected or occupied by the ſick.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond purpoſe they recommended, a new law on the ſubject, which will be hereafter recurred to. See next page.</p>
            <p>On the twenty-ſecond day of Auguſt the Board of Health requeſted the College to adopt and publiſh ſuch advice as would tend to check the progreſs of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034355_0008_0FFC234E05E3B0C0"/>
The College, accordingly on the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-fifth, furniſhed the board with their ſentiments on the ſubject. Their plan conſiſted, generally, in ſeparating the ſick from the well, great attention to cleanlineſs, free admiſſion of air, purification of bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, cloathing, &amp;c. by expoſing them to the ſmoke of charcoal and ſulphur in cloſe rooms, the free uſe of lime and cold water, and the application of the vapor produced by mixing oil of vitriol and ſalt petre, in ſick rooms.</p>
            <p>October 30th, a letter was read from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of the ſtate requeſting to know <q>what meaſures ought to be purſued to purify the city from any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent infection, and what precautions were beſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to guard againſt the future recurrence of a ſimilar calamity.</q> On the ſeventh day of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember a full anſwer to the Governor's letter was agreed on and communicated to him. This letter is here introduced as giving more fully the ſenſe of the College on this very intereſting ſubject.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>We have duly conſidered your letter of the 24th ult. and ſhall cheerfully comply with the requiſitions contained therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="unknown:034355_0009_0FFC224D91CF3440"/>The meaſures to be purſued for purifying the city from any latent infection, are ſuch as we have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recommended, viz.—A ſtrict attention to clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, waſhing, white-waſhing, and ventilating the infected houſes, bedding and cloathing; and fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating them with charcoal and ſulphur, or a mixture of oil of vitriol and ſalt-petre. Theſe, with the froſt, we believe, will be found ſufficient entirely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy any latent contagion.</p>
                  <p>But the latter part of your inquiry, viz. What precautions are beſt calculated to guard againſt the future occurrence of a ſimilar calamity, is an object of ſuch magnitude, as to demand a more particular reply.</p>
                  <p>We have, on former occaſions, communicated our ſentiments on this head; but as you now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, that it is intended to eſtabliſh a foundation for future regulations, we willingly enter into the detail; and though this will principally conſiſt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, yet it may be uſeful to have our ideas pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in one view for your conſideration. And as theſe ſentiments have been more fully confirmed by recent events, we are again induced earneſtly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend a ſtrict adoption of the meaſures we adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our communication of Auguſt 18th, 1797, as
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034355_0010_0FFC2347BA9930B0"/>
being the beſt calculated to guard againſt the future introduction of contagious diſeaſes. We now recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate thoſe advices with ſome additions.</p>
                  <p>Let an entire new health-law be made, conſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Board of Health, to conſiſt of five perſons, two of whom to be practitioners of phyſic. The ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the number will enſure reſponſibility, and a conſtant reſidence in the city; and the profeſſional knowledge of the medical characters will be neceſſary to aſſiſt in directing the meaſures of the Board. Let no perſon whoſe private intereſt may be affected by quarantine laws, be a member of this Board.</p>
                  <p>Let a ſufficient ſum of money, per annum, be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the draughts of the Board, who ſhall render to the Aſſembly a yearly account of their expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Let this Board ſit daily during the months of July, Auguſt, September, and October; and, during theſe months let every veſſel from the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean, coaſt of Africa, Weſt-Indies, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of America, to the ſouthward of Florida, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form an effectual quarantine. Let the cargoes of ſuſpicious veſſels be unloaded, and, with the veſſels, be purified at the Iſland.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="unknown:034355_0011_0FFC234447AF02B0"/>Let a reſident phyſician, or health-officer be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, who ſhall never be abſent from the Iſland during the above mentioned months, and a conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing phyſician, who ſhall reſide at Philadelphia.</p>
                  <p>Let the puniſhment of a maſter of a veſſel, who evades the law, by landing cargo, crew or paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, contrary to the intent and meaning of it, be the ſame as for murder of the ſecond degree. Let no veſſel of war ever be allowed to come above the fort.</p>
                  <p>Let co-operative laws be procured from the neighbouring legiſlatures or from congreſs.</p>
                  <p>Let the Board of Health have power, with the concurrence of the Governor, to cut off the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with infected perſons and places. Let the long projected Hoſpital be erected.</p>
                  <p>Let the moſt diligent and ſcrupulous attention be given to cleaning and watering the ſtreets, gutters and wharves, throughout the city and liberties.</p>
                  <p>Such are the precautions which we believe beſt calculated to guard againſt the future occurrence of calamities ſimilar to thoſe we have experienced. If

                  <head>To his Excellency, THOMAS MIFFLIN, Esq. Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennſylvania.</head>
                  <p>Although the College had now complied with every requiſition that had been made to them, yet, feelingly impreſſed with the magnitude of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, they judged it proper to preſent to the ſtate legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature their reaſons for believing the diſeaſe to be of foreign origin, hoping that the legiſlature would be induced to make ſuch a change in the health-laws as might ſecure us from its future introduction. This Memorial was accompanied with a narrative of facts relative to the probable origin and progreſs of the malignant contagious fever, which had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared amongſt us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="unknown:034355_0013_0FFC233CD83649B8"/>The Memorial contains our moſt ſtriking reaſons for believing in the foreign origin of the diſeaſe, but for general information, it may be uſeful more fully to adduce our arguments in ſupport of theſe opinions, which have been ſtill further confirmed by the circumſtances that have occurred during the laſt ſummer and Autumn; accompanied with ſuch a ſtatement of facts as we think cannot fail of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing conviction in every unprejudiced mind.</p>
                  <p>Our aim is the inveſtigation and ſpreading of truth on this important ſubject. We are equally intereſted, with our fellow-citizens in diſcovering the means of averting ſo terrible a diſeaſe. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per health-law for the purpoſe has not yet been applied, and unleſs ſomething more efficient be done upon the occaſion, our ſea-port towns may ſoon become uninhabitable.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall give our reaſons for believing that the diſeaſe in queſtion is not of domeſtic origin, and we truſt they will prove convincing to our legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to our fellow-citizens, generally.</p>
                  <p>When the deſtructive peſtilence raged at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcilles in 1720, there were found phyſicians of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, who ſtrenuouſly maintained, that it was
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:034355_0014_0FFC23381ACB15C8"/>
neither a contagious nor an imported diſeaſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">See A Treatiſe on the Plague, by Patrick Ruſſell, M. D. F. R. S. and ſurgeon to the Britiſh factory at Aleppo. Printed, London, 1791.</note> They derived it from the poor diet of the lower claſs of the inhabitants; and although they ſaw the veſſel that brought it, and the moſt unequivocal and dreadful marks of contagion, yet they ſtill perſiſted in their firſt opinions. Similar contrarieties of opinion prevailed at Meſſina in 1743, but efficient quarantine laws have ſince preſerved Marſeilles and Meſſina from this deſtructive viſitant, although con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually expoſed.</p>
                  <p>In the preſent year the city of Baltimore has been preſerved in a ſimilar manner, and we would aſk, Is the city of Boſton more expoſed by its ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the generation of tropical diſeaſes than Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timore. Where do we ſee the firſt appearance of our peſtilential fever? Is it amongſt the marſhes to the ſouth weſt of our city, or in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the wharves? Is it in the confined alleys; or on the ſalubrious banks of the Delaware at Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington? Is it not always near thoſe places where veſſels from foreign countries are found?</p>
                  <p>Look at the diſeaſe itſelf; does any fever of our country ever aſſume ſuch forms, or produce ſuch
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034355_0015_0FFC233698961140"/>
effects? Do our ſevereſt bilious fevers generally ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate fatally in a few days? Do they ſteal on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly, infecting one perſon after another in a family and in a neighbourhood? Are they ever equally ſevere in ſeaſons ſo oppoſite as 1797 and 1798? Do not the riſe, the ſymptoms, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and the termination of this fatal diſeaſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that it is totally different from any thing we have been accuſtomed to?</p>
                  <p>But more particularly to examine the ſubject: our principal reaſons for believing that this diſeaſe does not originate amongſt us, are the following:</p>
                  <p>Firſtly. It differs eſſentially from any other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe which is common to this country, and agrees in its moſt eſſential ſymptoms, with what is called the Yellow Fever in the Weſt Indies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. It has been regularly traced to the vicinity of ſome veſſel or veſſels, from the Weſt Indies; or to perſons or cloathing connected with them.</p>
                  <p>The principal peculiarities of this fever are, its contagious nature, the progreſs of the ſymptoms and the mortality conſequent on it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:034355_0016_0FFC233515EDFF98"/>To endeavour to prove the contagious nature of this diſeaſe would, in our opinion, be equally uſeleſs as to prove the contagion of the plague. But in all our obſervation and practice we know of no caſe, where the autumnal bilious remittents of our country have proved contagious. We are aware that theſe are ſometimes attended with violent and dangerous ſymptoms, but this ſtriking characteriſtic of contagion being always abſent, they never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an object of public dread or concern.</p>
                  <p>The characteriſtic ſymptoms of this diſeaſe are, generally, a conſtant fever for about three days, which, in dangerous caſes, is followed by a ceſſation thereof. The concomitant ſymptoms of yellowneſs of the ſkin, and vomiting of black matter, which are ſo common in this fever, do ſometimes, though rarely, occur in other diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>The mortality which enſues is ſuch as is common when peſtilential diſeaſes prevail. The general confuſion and deſertion of the ſick, naturally add to the fatal conſequences of theſe diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond point, the origin of the fever, we may obſerve, that until the year 1793, no doubts on this ſubject, as far as we know, had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034355_0017_0FFC2330A54CEB70"/>
in America. Doctor Lining of Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, South Carolina, one of the beſt, and the only American author who had then publiſhed on this ſubject, and who wrote in 1753, expreſsly informs us, that the yellow fever had prevailed in that city four times within twenty-five years, and that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it appeared there, it was eaſily traced to ſome perſon who was lately arrived from ſome of the Weſt India Iſlands, where it was epidemical.</p>
                  <p>It may not be improper here to remark, that very erroneous opinions on this ſubject have ariſen from confounding this peſtilential fever with the malignant remittents of the Weſt Indies and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. The difference ſtill holds good, that theſe laſt are not contagious, if we may give credit to the writings and obſervations of Phyſicians who have practiſed in the Weſt Indies, added to our own. But the malignant fever which prevailed in this city in 1793, 1797, and 1798, was always more or leſs ſo, according to circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>A ſtriking peculiarity, which does not occur in any other diſeaſe, attends the yellow fever in the Weſt Indies. The natives and perſons who have reſided long in thoſe iſlands, are very ſeldom ſeized with this fever. It was likewiſe remarked, and it
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034355_0018_0FFC232F2011DE90"/>
is a circumſtance that deſerves particular attention, that very few, if any, of the Creole French in this city, ſuffered from the contagious malignant fever which prevailed here, in 1793, 1797, and 1798, though the diſeaſe was introduced into their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; and children born in this country, of Creole parents, died with it laſt autumn, while the parents and the children born in the Weſt Indies, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely exempt from it. To European French, Iriſh, and other ſtrangers, the diſeaſe was remarkably fatal. It is an obſervation, founded in long and extenſive experience, and which admits not of an exception, that ſtrangers are the greateſt ſufferers from the diſeaſes of the country into which they migrate: were the yellow fever a diſeaſe of our country, the Creoles would probably have been among the firſt to experience its fatal effects; but as it is of Weſt India origin, and their conſtitutions are aſſimilated to it, they eſcaped it here as they do in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive country. The natives of the Weſt Indies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſeldom affected with the yellow fever, has given riſe and currency to the opinion, that it is not contagious in that country, and with reſpect to them the obſervation is well founded; but then it is as highly contagious to Europeans and Americans in the ſea-ports of the Weſt Indies, as it is in this city, when introduced here. [See Note A. in the Appendix.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="unknown:034355_0019_0FFC232D9B16C4C8"/>It is no new opinion that peſtilential fevers are generated in ſhips or tranſported by them from one place to another; and that when they are brought to a ſea-port, where the climate and ſeaſon favor their ſpreading, they always do ſo in a greater or leſs degree.</p>
                  <p>The plague is checked by great heat and ſevere cold in the cities of Europe and Aſia. We have full proof of the effect of cold upon the malignant contagious fever in North America.</p>
                  <p>We have equal proof that efficient quarantine laws have latterly preſerved the ſea-port towns of Europe from the introduction of the plague; and the example of Baltimore, [Note B.] in the preſent year, ſhews us what may be done in America in this reſpect. The inefficacy of our own laws and regulations in this important matter is well known, and much regretted by all who have been concerned in their execution.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps a more particular attention to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the fever of the preſent year, may place this ſubject in a clearer point of light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="unknown:034355_0020_0FFC2327A1526540"/>In the months of June and July laſt, twenty-ſeven veſſels arrived in this port from Cape Nichola Mole, Jeremie and Port-au-Prince in the Iſland of Hiſpaniola or St. Domingo, places which had long been garriſoned by the Britiſh forces, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence more peculiarly adapted to the generation of peſtilential diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>It is a well known fact, that theſe places were evacuated in great haſte, and that a conſiderable number of American veſſels which lay there, were employed to tranſport the Britiſh garriſon; and if we are to give credit to the facts related by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, [Note C.] Lind, [Note D.] Brockleſby, Young, Carmichael Smyth and others, contagion is not only generated in ſuch circumſtances, but for a long time retained, by cloathing, bedding, tents, and ſails, even walls and timber.</p>
                  <p>We have further proof that the yellow fever prevailed in thoſe ports while the above-mentioned veſſels lay there. [Note E.]</p>
                  <p>On the fifth day of July laſt, ſix or eight of theſe veſſels, having a large number of paſſengers on board, of courſe a quantity of cloathing, bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp;c. brought off in the greateſt haſte, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034355_0021_0FFC2325C5CEFBF8"/>
expoſed to all thoſe circumſtances which are generally allowed to produce contagious fevers: in this ſituation they arrived at the fort, where they were detained on board for twenty days, [Note F.] an occurrence well adapted to heighten the violence of the contagion. On their arrival at the city, after this detention, they generally lay at the wharves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Walnut and Spruce ſtreets. [Note G.] And it is well known, that at this part of the city the fever firſt appeared, about the latter end of July and beginning of Auguſt, and ſpread from thence to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every other quarter. Theſe are facts too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and too generally admitted to require further proof.</p>
                  <p>On the evening of the eighth of July, the armed ſhip Deborah, captain Edward Yard, arrived at the fort from Jeremie. She buried <hi>eight</hi> perſons during her ſtay there and return, [Note H.] and ſent <hi>ſix</hi> ſick to the Marine hoſpital. [Note I.] She was one of thoſe employed to tranſport troops in the Weſt Indies. [Note K.] After a detention of ten days this veſſel came up to the city. We have been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that ſome of her crew were brought up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her arrival. [Note L.]</p>
                  <p>On the twenty-eighth of July, the Deborah was moved to Kenſington, where ſhe was hove down.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:034355_0022_0FFC231ECFA17AE8"/>
We can clearly trace the riſe and progreſs of the diſeaſe at that place to this veſſel; [Note M.] and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the firſt appearance of it in ſome other parts of the city to perſons who had been on board her. [Note N.]</p>
                  <p>On the ſixth day of Auguſt, the College recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the managers of the Marine and City hoſpitals, that all the veſſels lying between Walnut and Spruce ſtreets ſhould be removed to a proper diſtance from the city; inſtead of which they were diſtributed indiſcriminately to the other wharves, except in one inſtance, moſt of them being ſent to the upper parts of the city.</p>
                  <p>From the many ſources of contagion above enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated, exiſting at the ſame time, and being ſo generally ſpread, it is not ſurpriſing that the diſeaſe had ſuch an extenſive operation; and it is to this extraordinary circumſtance that we alſo aſcribe the introduction and prevalence of this diſeaſe at Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, [Note O.] Wilmington and Marcus-hook.</p>
                  <p>A diſeaſe ſo fatal and ſo deſtructive, has natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directed the public attention to diſcover the means of preventing its future recurrence. And as men are generally inclined to aſcribe effects to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding circumſtances; ſo in the preſent caſe a
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:034355_0023_0FFC231D4DDD7810"/>
variety of means have been ſuggeſted to prevent any future calamity of a ſimilar nature.</p>
                  <p>But when we reflect, that Philadelphia is one of the cleaneſt beſt aired cities in the union; that Kenſington, Cheſter and Wilmington, enjoy all the advantages of country air; that no poſſible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement with reſpect to water or ventilation, can make our ſituation more eligible than that of theſe places; and particularly when we conſider, that the ſituation of Wilmington precludes all idea of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ventilation, and that New-York, being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with water brought from a diſtance, the bad quality of our water cannot be the cauſe. When we obſerve that our city has become more healthy by the ſalutary improvements made in it, that the number of our common native diſeaſes, ſuch as autumnal remittents and dyſenteries, is greatly dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. When we alſo obſerve that it is only in ſea-ports that this fatal peſtilential fever prevails, why ſhould we refuſe, in this particular inſtance, candidly to deduce effects from cauſes, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that although local circumſtances may favour the ſpreading of ſuch diſeaſes, yet, as they can always be traced to the ſhipping or its neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or to perſons or materials connected with
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:034355_0024_0FFC231AF59C2EA0"/>
ſhipping, that there are the ſtrongeſt reaſons to conclude that they are introduced from thence?</p>
                  <p>From the preceding facts and obſervations we think the following concluſions may be juſtly drawn.</p>
                  <p>That the contagious malignant fever which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in this city in the years 1793, 1797, and 1798, is eſſentially different from the bilious remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent fever of this climate.</p>
                  <p>That the contagious malignant fever of thoſe years is eſſentially the ſame, with the diſeaſe called the <hi>yellow fever</hi> in the Britiſh, and the <hi>maladie de Siam,</hi> in the French Weſt India iſlands.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>yellow fever</hi> or <hi>maladie de Siam</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in a very great degree in the different ports of Hiſpaniola, during the laſt year, and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in Port-au-Prince, Jeremie and Cape Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Mole.</p>
                  <p>That a very great number of veſſels arrived at this city from thoſe ports, during the months of June and July 1798.</p>
                  <p>That this diſeaſe has been ſeveral times introduced into North America by contagion retained in the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:034355_0025_0FFC231852768448"/>
wearing apparel of perſons who had died in the Weſt Indies, although no perſon was ſick on board at the time the veſſel arrived in this country; and that we have demonſtrated, as fully as it is poſſible in a matter which is not obvious to our ſenſes, that the contagion of the fever of 1798 was imported from Jeremie, Cape Nichola Mole or Port-au-Prince, in one or more veſſels, which arrived here in June and July laſt.</p>
                  <p>That efficient quarantine laws, ſimilar to thoſe exiſting in Italy, France and other countries, to prevent the introduction of the plague into their commercial cities, are the only effectual means to guard againſt the future recurrence of a calamity which threatens us with total ruin.</p>
                  <p>To conclude—We have, from the firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this deſtructive peſtilence in 1793 to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, endeavoured to diſcharge our duty, by warning our fellow citizens of its appearance, and by pointing out the means of checking its extenſion when introduced; by informing the legiſlature of the proper methods of preventing its return, by ſtrict quarantine laws and internal regulations; and although our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations have been too little attended to, yet
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:034355_0026_0FFC231568D458C8"/>
we conceive it to be a duty again thus to publiſh our opinions on the ſubject in a more detailed and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar manner, as well for the information of our fellow citizens at large, as of thoſe who are called to the very important office of legiſlation. In doing this we have no deſign of entering into or exciting contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: our ſole aim is truth and the public good.</p>

Fellow of the Royal College of Phyſicians of Edinburgh, and of the Royal Societies of London and Edinburgh; and Phyſician to the Forces in the West Indies.

               </head>
               <p>SOME late authors, who have written on Weſt-India diſeaſes, have roundly aſſerted, that in tropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal countries fevers are not contagious; but whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has had the care of crowded hoſpitals, of jails, of ſhips of war, or of tranſports full of troops, muſt have ſeen numerous and fatal inſtances of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion in the Weſt Indies; more eſpecially where cleanlineſs and free ventilation have been neglected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:034355_0028_0FFC230F378AC7D0"/>From cauſes of this ſort a moſt fatal and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive diſorder broke out in the Weſt Indies in 1793, and ſoon after in Philadelphia, viz. the yellow fever. Dr. Ruſh has claſſed this diſorder with remittents; but every one who has practiſed in the Weſt Indies, knows for certain, that the remitting fevers of warm countries are not contagious. From, Dr. Ruſh's book, and from the numerous letters of my corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondents, there remains not a doubt, in my mind, of the yellow fever being Typhus, exalted to a great degree of virulence from climate, ſituation, and other adventitious circumſtances.</p>
               <p>The yellow fever has appeared in America at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent periods, as we learn from Dr. Lining's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the Edinburgh Eſſays, Phyſical and Literary, Vol. II.; and it was this ſame diſorder that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſuch havock amongſt the troops, under Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Vernon, in 1741.</p>
               <p>The commencement of this fever, in Grenada, is dated from May, 1793, ſoon after the arrival of a Guinea ſhip from Sierra Leone, the crew of which had been ſo ſickly, that moſt of the ſailors died of the yellow fever, either in the voyage, or ſoon after the arrival of the ſhip. It ſuddenly ſpread over the other Leeward iſlands, and from thence was carried to Philadelphia, Hiſpaniola, and Jamaica.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:034355_0029_0FFC230AC7A7E660"/>The firſt account I received of this fever, was from Dr. James Clark, a phyſician of eminence in Dominica; his letter to me is dated July 23, 1793, and runs as follows: <q>I have been haraſſed night and day, for a month paſt, by attendance on people ill of the yellow fever. Since its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this iſland, it has already carried off more than a hundred ſailors, new comers, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants. In its progreſs it has been, and ſtill is, as quick and fatal as the plague; it often finiſhes its courſe in forty-eight hours; but if the ſick get paſt the fifth day, they generally recover.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All the letters I have had from my medical friends agree, that this fever is highly contagious, and that new comers are moſt ſubject to receive it, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſuch as are young, or are addicted to drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirituous liquors. Next to theſe are the nurſes and attendants on the ſick, who breathe the air in their chambers, or handle their bodies or bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes. But ſuch as avoid infected houſes, or keep at a diſtance from people convaleſcent, are no way ſubject to the yellow fever. It appears, alſo, that people of colour, and negroes, are in a manner to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally exempted from this diſeaſe, except ſuch as are employed as houſe ſervants, and fare the ſame as white people.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:034355_0030_0FFC2306CB2A6600"/>The Creole white inhabitants, and others who have long reſided in the iſlands, are, it ſeems, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom attacked with this diſorder, unleſs under the circumſtances above-mentioned. But why the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever ſhould attack ſome, and not others, can only be accounted for in this way: that in order to receive or reſiſt contagion, men's bodies and minds muſt be in a particular ſtate; and that field negroes ſhould not be liable to it is to me inexplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

               <p>During my reſidence in Santo Domingo and the Cape, I received frequent information that the yellow fever prevailed in almoſt all the ſea-port towns in the French part of Hiſpaniola, particularly at Cape Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chola Mole. It raged ſo violently at this latter place, and the mortality was ſo great, that it obliged the Britiſh to abandon the poſt ſooner than they intended. About the ſame time this diſeaſe made its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the harbour of St. Thomas, and was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to foreigners that it obtained the name of
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:034355_0035_0FFC22F6EF91C7B8"/>
                  <hi>the plague</hi> from all thoſe who ſpoke of it. At Santo Domingo I ſaw ſeveral caſes of it, during the months of Auguſt and September. Theſe were entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to American ſeamen, while the native inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of the city were altogether exempt from it. The privateers which frequented this port loſt alſo ſeveral of their crew by this fever, while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at anchor.</p>
               <p>I mentioned to you that a ſimilar diſeaſe had broke out on board of the ſchooner Swift at Porto-Rico. The following are the facts reſpecting that veſſel, viz. On the 11th of laſt March ſhe ſailed from the Delaware, and, after touching at Tortola and St. Thomas, arrived at the city of Santo Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo on the 13th of April, where ſhe continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the 26th of June, when, ſhe went to the Cape, and returned again on the 1ſt of Auguſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out touching at any other port. She remained at Santo Domingo until the 28th of October, and then ſailed for Porto-Rico, where ſhe arrived on the 5th, of November. She anchored at the entrance of the harbour, at a conſiderable diſtance from any other veſſel. A ſhort time before ſhe left the city of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Domingo ſhe took on board, from a French pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateer that had been diſmantled, a quanty of rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, ſails, guns and ammunition. From the time
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:034355_0036_0FFC22F4B32F60D8"/>
that ſhe left Philadelphia until her arrival at Porto-Rico the crew were healthy, except two of the ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors who were affected with venereal complaints. The ſecond day after ſhe anchored at this latter port the mate and one of the ſailors began to complain, and the greateſt part of the crew, together with the captain, were ſucceſſively attacked. The two firſt died after a ſhort illneſs, and one of the others during her paſſage to America. The captain eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in conſequence of being brought on ſhore and carefully attended, at the commencement of the diſorder. When ſhe arrived at Porto-Rico, and during her ſtay there, both the harbour and city were remarkably healthy, and her crew had little or no communication with either the ſhore or the ſhipping. Theſe are all the facts which have come to my knowledge reſpecting the exiſtence of this diſeaſe in the Weſt Indies, during the laſt ſummer and fall. I remain, Sir,</p>

               <head>The following paper was given to Doctor William Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, by Mr. John Purdon.</head>
               <p>Mr. Purdon ſays that on the afternoon of the 1ſt. or 2d. day of Auguſt, being at the houſe of Mr. Alexander Philips in Water ſtreet, he was informed in the courſe of converſation by Mr. Philips, that he himſelf had gone down to a ſhip at the fort, and brought from thence one of his old lodgers, then ſick, to his own houſe in Water ſtreet. Mr. Purdon obſerved to him with horror and aſtoniſhment that he had acted very wrong, and immediately departed from his houſe. Mr. Phillips on that day was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently in perfect health; on the Saturday night following he was a corpſe. Mr. Purdon was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Mr. Philips from what ſhip he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the ſick man, but by Mr. Iſaac Milnor, a few weeks after, that it was from the ſhip Deborah, and on the ninth night of her quarantine.</p>

               <p>I ſhall now proceed to mention a few of the early caſes of yellow fever, that occurred in the immediate neighbourhood of the wharf where the ſhip Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah lay. The ſhip Deborah arrived at George Eyre's wharf in Kenſington on the 28th day of July, and remained there until the 8th day of Auguſt following.</p>
               <p>Joſeph Streeton, the firſt victim in Kenſington, was on board the ſhip Deborah July 21ſt, 1798, whilſt ſhe lay in the city, was taken ſick July 29th, and died Auguſt 3d.</p>
               <p>James Porter, an apprentice boy of Joſeph Griſe, who lived next door to Streeton's, was taken ſick Auguſt 1ſt, and died Auguſt 12th.</p>
               <p>James Aſhmore, an apprentice lad of Wm. Yard's, whoſe dwelling houſe is oppoſite the wharf where the ſhip lay, and who had worked on board while ſhe lay in the city about the 18th or 20th of July, was taken ſick Auguſt 2d and died Auguſt 15th.</p>
               <p>James Kerr, George Adams, — Simons, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice boys of Wm. Yard's, who worked on board the ſhip, were all taken ſick a few days after the firſt
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:034355_0044_0FFC22D940DB0268"/>
appearance of indiſpoſition in J. Aſhmore, their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low apprentice, and all recovered.</p>
               <p>Two labouring men of the name of Sutton, who worked on board the ſhip, were taken ſick Auguſt 3d, one of whom died; the other recovered.</p>
               <p>Samuel Baker, whoſe dwelling houſe is directly oppoſite the wharf where the Deborah lay, was on the wharf July 31ſt, when his noſtrils were aſſailed with a very offenſive ſtench from the ſhip, out of which, the people who worked on board were heaving ſome lumber, and which inſtantly induced him to leave the wharf, was taken ſick Auguſt 3d, and recovered.</p>
               <p>Daniel de Benneville, who rode by the wharf in his chaiſe, daily for a week before his indiſpoſition, and for three days previous walked twice or thrice a day on the banks, nearly oppoſite the wharf where the ſhip lay, the wind blowing directly from the ſhip, wafting a diſagreeable ſtench, which he obſerved to Manuel Eyre, the elder, who was in company; and which produced a violent nauſea, in conſequence of which he left the ſhade on the bank, returned to his houſe, and took ſome lavender water and loaf ſugar, but without any effectual relief, until he
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:034355_0045_0FFC22D72B532BD8"/>
ejected the contents of his ſtomach, with a large proportion of bile, by vomiting; he was taken ſick Auguſt 5th and recovered.</p>
               <p>Catherine Pecky (Daniel de Benneville's houſe-keeper) was taken ſick Auguſt 7th, 11 o'Clock A. M. and died Auguſt 19th.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth de Benneville (wife of Daniel de Benneville) was taken ſick Auguſt 7th, P. M. and recovered.</p>
               <p>Joſhua Baker (ſon of the aforeſaid Samuel Baker) who had been on board the Deborah, was taken ſick Auguſt 9th, and died Auguſt 15th.</p>
               <p>Jacob Miller, who lived about 300 yards from the ſhip, and daily walked by the wharf to his work, was taken Auguſt 9th, and died Auguſt 15th.</p>
               <p>Jane Newman, daughter of the widow Mary Newman, who lived nearly oppoſite the wharf where the ſhip lay, was taken ſick Auguſt 10th, and died Auguſt 25th.</p>
               <p>Suſannah Baker (wife of the aforeſaid Samuel Baker) was taken ſick Auguſt 12th, and died Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 22d.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:034355_0046_0FFC22D4F3CD13F0"/>Sarah Eyre (daughter of Manuel Eyre) was taken ſick Auguſt 15th, and recovered.</p>
               <p>Charlotta Yard (wife of William Yard) was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſick Auguſt 15th, and recovered.</p>
               <p>Jacob Fawns, who worked on board the ſhip Deborah whilſt ſhe lay at Kenſington, was taken ſick and recovered.</p>
               <p>Three apprentice boys belonging to George Eyre, who worked about 100 yards from the Deborah, were all taken ſick, one of whom died, and the reſt recovered.</p>
               <p>Caeſar Maul, a negro lad living with Daniel de Benneville aforeſaid, was taken ſick Auguſt 19th, and recovered.</p>
               <p>John M'Curdy was taken ſick whilſt working on board the Deborah, and recovered.</p>
               <p>Thomas Norris, who worked on board the ſhip Deborah from two days after ſhe arrived, until ſhe ſailed, was ſeized, whilſt working on board, with a violent nauſea, pain in his head, loins and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, was relieved by ſevere vomiting and ſweating
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:034355_0047_0FFC22D0B0053E50"/>
that enſued the night following, and felt no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of indiſpoſition thereafter.</p>
               <p>Henry Underwick, William Moore, George Jenny, and Allen Robinett, who worked on Doughty's wharf, about 100 yards from the ſhip Deborah, whilſt ſhe lay at Kenſington, were all taken ſick about the latter end of Auguſt and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of September, and died.</p>
               <p>I have been ſo repeatedly interrupted in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs that neceſſity obliged me to do it in haſte, and with a pre-occupied mind. The people here are in the day time employed in their ſeveral occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that I have been obliged to take the evening and beſt part of the night to obtain correct intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence on this ſubject, and that at intervals: which of courſe has taken longer time to effect my purpoſe; and which you will excuſe.</p>

                     <p>Mr. Ralſton was attacked with the fever July 25: on the 29th, I firſt viſited him, he died on the 30th. He was at work on board the ſhip Deborah the three days immediately preceding the attack.</p>

               <p>John Butcher, a ſeaman reſiding in Mifflin's alley, worked nine days on board the Deborah, firſt at Race ſtreet wharf, then at Kenſington; until he was taken ſick on the 2d Auguſt laſt. Being oppoſite my laboratory, his wife requeſted I would call and ſee him. He appeared to me to have the ſymptoms of the yellow fever. He was immediately bled plentifully, and briſkly purged; he recovered
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:034355_0049_0FFC22C9ACD5CC68"/>
in 2 or 3 days. Doctor Proudfit alſo viſited him and was of the ſame opinion.</p>
               <p>This being in the evening of the 3d Auguſt and the health office ſhut, I requeſted Captain Lawler to inform the Board thereof, who next morning ſent Doctor Duffield to viſit him; when Butcher, by the operation of the above remedies, was ſo much better that Doctor Duffield doubted his having the diſeaſe. Yet the impreſſion was ſo great on my mind, that I immediately ſent my children to the country. I am ſtill of the opinion, that he was the firſt who brought the fever into Mifflin's alley, where it was ſo fatal.</p>

               <p>I met Davis Bevan in Second ſtreet, who informed me, as a proof of the Deborah's being an unhealthy veſſel, that ſeven boys of Cheſter went in a boat to ſee a comrade on board, ſtaid with him an hour or two, and returned: that in two or three days, ſix of them were taken ill of a fever, ſuppoſed to be the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:034355_0050_0FFC22C72A1982F8"/>
yellow fever, and that five of them died in leſs than ten days. He ſaid he would take his oath of this fact, if required.</p>
               <p>I think I am accurate, for it appeared to me a ſtrong confirmation of the Deborah's importing the yellow fever of 1798.</p>
