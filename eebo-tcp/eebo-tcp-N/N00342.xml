            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thus the Father and the Son are two distinct Persons, although essentially One, yet personally Two. Again, Covenants are <hi>voluntary</hi> Transactions; so it is here, God the Father was voluntary therein, for He might have chose whether He would have accepted of satisfaction for sin from any but the Sinner himself. It was not any necessity of nature, but an Act of His ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Will and Pleasure, to propound terms of Reconciliation. The <hi>Son</hi> was likewise vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary in this matter; for He might have refused to have <hi>accepted</hi> of the Terms of this Covenant, but it pleased Him to accept there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Moreover, where there are Terms and Articles of Agreement accepted of, on both parts, there is a proper Covenant: So it is here (as afterwards will appear.) God saith unto His Son; If Thou willt become a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of My Elect, Thou must goe into the World, and take on Thee the Nature of Man,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000416_0016_0FA5B58B13B7DDE8"/>
and in that Nature <hi>doe</hi> and <hi>suffer</hi> all that is needful to be done in order to Salvation; <hi>I will doe it All,</hi> saith Christ. Here now is a glorious Covenant.</p>
            <p>Propos. 2. <hi>GOD hath made glorious Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to Jesus Christ, on condition of His undertake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work of a</hi> Redeemer. <hi>e. g.</hi> God has promised that He should be every way fitted and qualified for that Undertaking, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that an humane nature should be created for Him, that so He might be in a Capacity for the management of that Undertaking, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 4. <hi>A</hi> Body <hi>hast Thou prepared Me, O God.</hi> And that Gifts and Graces of the holy Spirit should be poured upon Him, according to that great and unparalell'd Undertaking.

It is an higher Expression than can be used concerning any man or Angel, or Creature, but only is it spoken concerning Christ (who is more than a man or Creature.

Therefore look into the 49th Chapter of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> where this Covenant of Redemption which we are now discoursing of, is likewise intimated: In the two first verses Christ speaketh of his Call to the work of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; in the <hi>third verse</hi> there is a promise that the elect <hi>Jews</hi> should be converted to Christ. Nay but saith Christ (<hi>v.</hi> 4.) I must have more than that, My blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

That Will has Respect to the Covenant of Redemption, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Will of God concerning Christs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the world to doe the work of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. The Sanctification of Believers doth originally flow from thence. And their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation was promised to Jesus Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. God promised that Incase Christ would become subject unto Death, all Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers on Him shall receive an everlasting inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. There are also promises made to Christ of <hi>Victory</hi> over all His Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

in order to the Salvation of his <hi>Elect,</hi> he should not continue long in that state of death, but should have a glorious Resurrection to life and immortality. Therefore well might the Apostle say, <hi>It was impossible for him to be held under the pains of death, Act.</hi> 2. 24. And God promised that a glorious Reward should be given to him, as we see in the <hi>last</hi> verse of this Chapter. And accordingly God hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Jesus Christ to sit at his own right hand, and hath made not only men but Angels and Authorities and Powers to subject to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause He hath been obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cross, therefore God hath exalted him, and given him a Name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove every name, that at the Name of <hi>JESUS</hi> every knee shall bow in Heaven, and in the earth, and under the earth.</p>
            <p>Propos. 3. <hi>Jesus Christ the Son of God has accepted of this undertaking according to the terms propounded by the Father.</hi> Hence it is that God is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Propos. 4. <hi>The Generation of the Son of God is a</hi> spiritual <hi>and an</hi> intellectual <hi>Generation.</hi> God is a Spirit, and therefore all <hi>carnal</hi> Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations about this Generation are to be abhorred.

                  </hi> as the son does bear the Image and Nature of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  </q> And the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth set forth the Generation of the Son of God by such expressions as shew that it is spiritual and intellectual. <hi>e. g.</hi> He is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Wisdom of God.</hi> 1.

               <p>Again, Christ is called the <hi>Word of God.</hi> Rev. 19. 13. 1. Joh. 5. 7. Now there is not only a <hi>sensible</hi> word which is pronounced, but <hi>intelligible</hi> word which is brought forth in

the understanding. Words are the <hi>Birth</hi> of the <hi>Understanding:</hi> so the Son of God is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by the Infinite Understanding of the Father.</p>
               <p>Propos. 5. <hi>Though God the Father and the Son are</hi> personally distinct, <hi>they are</hi> es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially <hi>One.</hi> Therefore the Son is called the <hi>express Image of his Person, Heb.</hi> 1. 3.

A son is sometimes very like his father, the <hi>Picture</hi> of his Father, and so the Image of his person: but never any Son so like the father, as the Son of God is like <hi>His</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

are <hi>two</hi> Persons; so are God and Christ; yet are they <hi>essentially</hi> One. Joh. 10. 30. <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and I are</hi> One. If they were not Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially One, there would be more Gods than one, which is <hi>Heresy</hi> and <hi>Blasphemy</hi> to imagine.</p>
               <p>Propos. 6. <hi>The Generation of the Son of God is a wonderful and incomprehensible Mystery.</hi> That Particular insisted on in the former Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, manifests the Truth of this. That <hi>two</hi> Persons should be essentially <hi>One!</hi> That <hi>more</hi> Persons than one should be in the same indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Nature! Among <hi>created</hi> Beings it is not so, nor <hi>can</hi> it be; They that differ <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally</hi> have not the same individual Being, But God the Father and the Son have the same indivisible Essence. A Father and a Son have the same <hi>generical</hi> Essence, but not the same <hi>numerical</hi> Essence, but God the Father and the Son have so. And how wonderful is it to consider, that there should be a Father <hi>no older</hi> than his own Son, and an own Son <hi>no younger</hi> than his own Father! And how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful is it, that the <hi>same</hi> Person should be both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man!</hi> So is Christ. In that Vision to which my Text hath Referrence, He is called <hi>the Son of man.</hi> Rev. 1. 13, 14.

and here <hi>the Son of GOD,</hi> because he is both God and Man in one person. That there should be more Natures than one in the same individual person, is <hi>wonderful.</hi>

an <hi>Arch-Angel</hi> from Heaven said to the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary, that holy thing which shall be born of thee, shall be called the</hi> Son <hi>of</hi> God, <hi>Luc.</hi> 1. 35. Christ <hi>Himself</hi> bare witness to this Truth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his own <hi>Sonship.</hi> Joh. 10. 36. <hi>Say ye of him whom the Father has sanctified &amp; sent into the world, thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?</hi> And God from heaven has preached this Truth; At the Time when Christ was baptized, <hi>Lo, a voice from Heaven saying, this is my beloved</hi> Son, <hi>hear ye Him,</hi> Mat. 3. 17. Also at His Transfiguration, unto which the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> has respect when he saith, <hi>We were eye-witnesses of His Majesty, for he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came from the excellent Glory</hi> (i. e. from <hi>God,</hi> whom the <hi>Hebrews</hi> are wont to call by the Name of Glory) <hi>this is my beloved</hi> Son <hi>in whom I am well pleased: and this voice which came from Heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy Mount,</hi> 2. Pet. 1. 16, 17. 18.</p>
               <p>Arg. 2. <hi>From the Miracles which hapned at the Time of Christ's Passion.</hi> I do not mention the Sufferings of Christ to prove His Relation to God. His state of <hi>Humiliation</hi> was the great Objection which the <hi>Jews</hi> had against His being the SON of the <hi>Blessed.</hi> Hence Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

became a <hi>Rock of offence</hi> to them that would not believe that he was the Son of God except He <hi>came down from the Cross,</hi> Matth. 27. 42, 43. So the Heathen world; What! <hi>He</hi> be a <hi>God</hi> that was <hi>Crucified!</hi> they thought that <hi>incredible.</hi> But there were such Miracles attending the sufferings of Christ, as did plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifest that he was none other but the son of God. From the Sixth to the Ninth Hour of the day, there was Darkness all the Land over, This was no <hi>ordinary Eclipse</hi> of the Sun, for it was at the <hi>Full of the Moon,</hi> being at the <hi>Passover,</hi> whenas ordinary Solar Eclipses we know are at the <hi>New Moon</hi> Moreover, the <hi>Vail of the Temple was rent</hi> in twain, from the Top to the Bottom; and the Earth did quake, and the rocks rent, and the graves were opened, and Bodies of Saints which slept arose. These Solemn Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences were so convictive as that the <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> who commanded the Souldiers the day that Christ was crucified, cryed out, <hi>Truly, this was the</hi> Son of GOD. Oh the <hi>Jews</hi> have killed the <hi>Son of God.</hi> Mat. 27. 45,—51, 52, 54,</p>
               <p>Arg. 3. <hi>From the Resurrection and Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jesus Christ.</hi> He was declared to be

the <hi>Son of God,</hi> by the Resurrection from the Dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. Christ said that he was the Son of God before he suffered on the Cross; now if he had not been so indeed, we may be sure that God would never have raised him out of his grave. Also Christ raised <hi>Himself:</hi> Therefore did he say to the Jews, <hi>destroy this Temple,</hi> (meaning the Temple of his Body) <hi>and in three days</hi> I <hi>will</hi> raise <hi>it up. Joh.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
               <p>Nor would God have <hi>Exalted</hi> Him so as He hath done, even to <hi>sit at His own right hand,</hi> had He not been his own Son: <hi>For unto which of the Angels said He at any time, sit—at my right hand?</hi> God hath exalted him very high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giving him a <hi>Name above every Name.</hi> And we may therefore conclude, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</p>
               <p>Arg. 4. <hi>From the powerful quickening voice of Christ.</hi> Joh. 6. 63. <hi>The words</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>that I speak, they are spirit and life.</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 68, 69. <hi>Thou hast the words of eternal</hi> life. <hi>Peter</hi> might well therefore add, <hi>we are sure thou art the Son of God.</hi> God is known by His <hi>voice,</hi> Job. 40. 9. <hi>Hast thou an arm like God? canst thou thunder with a</hi> voice <hi>like Him?</hi> The voice of the Lord is powerful, the voice of the Lord is full of Majesty; the voice of

the Lord breaketh the Cedars, the voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire. So is the <hi>Son</hi> of God known by his voice: <hi>The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.</hi> Joh. 5. 25. Certainly, He that can by his <hi>voice</hi> make the dead to <hi>live,</hi> is more than a meer son of man, <hi>He is the Son of GOD.</hi>

<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000416_0046_0FA5B5A91B43B4B0"/>
speakes to the Hebrewes, <hi>When for the time you ought to be Teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God.</hi> Cap. 5. 12. It is marvellous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what Ignorance is in many that call themselves Christians. As an holy man once complained, (not without too much Cause) that <hi>Christ is but little known amongst Christians.</hi> Yea, some that are very knowing in <hi>other</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, yet if they be examined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Christ,</hi> they are found exceeding igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
               <p>Consid. 2. <hi>The surpassing Excellency of this Knowledge.</hi> Hence the Apostle saith, Yea doubtless I count all things but loss, for the <hi>Excellency of the Knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.</hi> Phil. 3. 8.

Christ is not known by the Light of Nature, but by the special Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> held forth in the Gospel. Wherefore the Apostle saith, <hi>It pleased God to reveal his son in me.</hi> Gal. 1. 15.

So the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> they had great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the <hi>Letter</hi> of the Scripture, and yet because they knew not <hi>Christ</hi> they perished to Eternity. Joh. 17. 3. <hi>This is life eternal, to</hi> know <hi>thee the only true God, &amp; Him whom thou hast sent, Jesus Christ</hi> Then they that remain <hi>ignorant</hi> of Christ, must needs be in danger of death, yea of <hi>eternal</hi> Death.</p>
               <p>By way of <hi>Direction</hi> here observe these Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we would have a right understanding in those Truths which concern the Person of Christ the Son of God, We must <hi>Attend the Mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s which the Lord hath appointed in order to the attaining that Knowledge.</hi> e. g. Searching the blessed <hi>Scriptures:</hi> therefore Christ said, <hi>Search the</hi> Scriptures <hi>for</hi> they <hi>testify of me.</hi> Joh.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:000416_0051_0FA5B5ADC184E2B0"/>
5. 39. And <hi>Solomon</hi> sheweth, that the way to know Wisdome is to seek and search after it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 4. h. e. We must <hi>digg</hi> and <hi>dive</hi> into the rich Mines of Scripture. In things of this nature, we must take heed of our own Conceits, but be sure to keep close to the Scriptures. And Attendance to the Word preached is also the way to gain and grow in the Knowledge of Christ. For it is the great work of the Ministry to preach Christ, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the Mysteryes of Christ. We read in <hi>Gen.</hi> 29. 3. How the Shepherds rolled the Stone from the Wells mouth, and watered the Sheep; So Ministers are to open the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of Christ and Salvation by Him. The Lord doth bestow gifts of Knowledge upon <hi>some</hi> above others for this end in special, that so they might be fitted for the work of the Ministry and might bring to the Knowledge of the Son of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 13. Prayer also is a meanes to attain this knowledge: <hi>If thou</hi> criest <hi>after knowledge and liftest up thy voice for understanding, then shalt thou find the knowledge of God,</hi> Prov. 2. 3, 5. We should pray for the illumination of the Spirit, and the rather because the Lord Jesus hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to send His Spirit to guide us into all Truth, Joh. 16. 13. Let us be earnest in
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:000416_0052_0FA5B5AE494AB538"/>
Prayer that we may receive that Unction from the Holy One that shall make us know all things, that are necessary to be known in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our Salvation and Consolation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Beware of Presumption &amp; Curiosity.</hi> We must not be wise above what is written. It is good to enquire into these divine and holy Mysteries, so far as God hath <hi>revealed,</hi> but no further: If we do, not <hi>Knowledge</hi> but <hi>Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> will be the effect of those Enquiries. A Vehement Object we say destroyeth the sense: If men come too near the Sun, their eyes are dazled that they cannot see. A <hi>Moth</hi> by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching too near the Light destroyeth it self; so many a proud Presumer by too bold prying into these glorious Mysteryes hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed his own soul.</p>
               <p>Exhort. 2. <hi>Believe this Truth, that</hi> Jesus Christ is the Son of GOD. It is not so easy a matter to believe this as many think for <hi>Reason</hi> cannot comprehend this Mystery, and <hi>thence</hi> it is not ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> after a right manner, with the heart to believe it. Yet It is necessary to be believed, as being a fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Religion. Therefore when <hi>Peter</hi> in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Disciples professed that <hi>Christ is
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:000416_0053_0FA5B5B1E167A6A8"/>
the Son of God,</hi> the Lord replyed, <hi>upon this rock I will build my Church,</hi> Mat. 16. 18. so then they that believe not this, do not belong to Christ, nor to the Church of Christ. All Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, yea <hi>whole Christianity</hi> would fall to the ground if <hi>this</hi> Principle should be plucked up. The Summe of the Gospel is contained in this great Truth. Hence <hi>Paul's</hi> Preaching is summarily expressed by saying, <hi>He preached Christ that He is the Son of God.</hi> Act. 9. 20. There are many Truths of lesser Concern, which through Ignorance may be disbelieved or denyed, and yet a mans Salvation not haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded thereby: But it is not so as to <hi>this</hi> Truth respecting the Sonship of Jesus Christ; whosoever disowneth <hi>it,</hi> will miss of eternal Salvation, 1. Joh. 2. 23. <hi>Whosoever denieth the</hi> Son, <hi>the same hath not the Father.</hi> Hence Satan hath made it his great design to oppose this Truth. The Devil said to Christ, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 3.) IF <hi>thou be the son of God.</hi> The wicked Devil would feign have that questioned. Wherefore in the dayes of the Apostles, he stirred up <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> and other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eticks who denyed the <hi>Deity,</hi> and so the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sonship</hi> of Christ, which is thought to be the occasion of <hi>John's</hi> writing his <hi>Gospel</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he doth most plainly and abundantly assert
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:000416_0054_0FA5B5B213ED8448"/>
the Godhead of Christ. Afterwards, Satan stirred up <hi>Arius,</hi> who maintained that Christ was only a <hi>Creature</hi> and not the eternally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of the Father; and the Church was in danger of being carried away with that flood of <hi>Arian Heresy</hi> which over-whelmed the world Rev. 12. 15. <hi>The whole christian world</hi> (as one of the Ancients speaketh) <hi>sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wondered to see it self become an</hi> Arian. Thus we see Satan layeth Battery against this Truth, because he knowes the souls and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of men are concern'd in the Belief of it. Therefore let us firmly believe it.</p>
               <p>By way of Direction, here remember these two Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We must set this down for a <hi>Principle,</hi> that <hi>we are to believe beyond Reason.</hi> Albeit the great Truths of the Christian Religion are not contrary <hi>unto,</hi> yet they are <hi>above</hi> Reason. Therefore must we believe what we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to comprehend. <hi>Pagans</hi> of old, were wont scoffingly to call the Christians <hi>Credentes,</hi> that is <hi>believing</hi> persons, because they were such as would believe beyond the comprehension of <hi>Reason.</hi> And one reason why <hi>Socinians</hi> in these late dayes have had such gross and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable mistakes about the <hi>Person of Christ,</hi> hath been because they would not believe beyond

Reason; whenas the great and glorious My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>athom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore we must set Faith on work, and though we cannot conceive how <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> should be, yet we are to take Divine Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for it. Take the Word of God for it that it is so, and there rest satisfied.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us not content our selves with a meer</hi> notional <hi>Belief about this matter; but see that our Faith be sincere and cordial.</hi> Let us see that this Truth be not only in our heads but in our hearts also. If men have only a notional Belief concerning this, that's no more than what the Devils have. Jam. 2. 19. <hi>Thou believest that there is one God, thou dost well, the</hi> Devils <hi>also believe and tremble.</hi> So do the Devils believe, that JESUS is the SON of GOD, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and tremble at the Apprehension of His Infinite MAJESTY. A whole Legion of Devils fell a roaring at the presence of the Lord Jesus, Crying, <hi>Jesus, thou Son of God, art thou come to torment us before the time?</hi> Mat. 8. 29.
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:000416_0056_0FA5B5B464554500"/>
But hearty Belief <hi>of,</hi> and Closure <hi>with</hi> this Truth is another thing. <hi>Philip</hi> said, <hi>If thou believest with all thine heart,</hi> unto him that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, <hi>I believe that</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>is the Son of God Act.</hi> 8. 37. That's necessary in order to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 18. <hi>With the heart man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth unto Righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto</hi> SALVATION. When a man doth <hi>so</hi> believe this Truth, as that he could gladly lay down his life for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing and Bearing witness to it, that's hearty Believing. As in the primitive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> it was as much as a man's Life was wort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to Confess this Truth. The Infidel <hi>Jews</hi> and Heathen of those dayes would be ready to kill any one that should profess such a Belief. In which respect the Apostle might well say as the 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>Whosoever confesseth that</hi> Jesus Christ is the SON of God, <hi>God is in him, and he in God.</hi> This is to be understood, not of a meer <hi>notional</hi> but of a <hi>cordial,</hi> yea and a <hi>Practical</hi> Believing.</p>
               <p>We proceed therefore to</p>
               <p>Exhor. 3. <hi>Practise according to this Truth.</hi> Let every one look to it, that they carry towards Christ as becometh towards the Son of God.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Answ. 1. <hi>Attend to whatever He shall say.</hi> That may be the special Reason why Christ in the Preface of his Epistle to the Church in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> mentions His being the Son of God, <abbr>

            <p>THe Apostle having in the preceding Chapters of this Epistle, handled the Doctrine of Justification, he proceeds in this (with several other Chapters following) to discourse concerning the Mystery of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination.</hi> He had before asserted, that the Elect of God could not perish; against which Assertion it might have been objected, That the <hi>Jews</hi> who were an elect Nation perish in their Infidelity: To this he Answers, That not <hi>Elect</hi> but <hi>Reprobate</hi> (whether amongst

Jews or Gentiles) are the persons that shall fall short of Salvation.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of this Chapter, <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth his exceeding great Sorrow, for the Unbelief of the Jews, and for their being thereupon rejected of God: And he mentions several things which were the springs and Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of his sorrow. One thing that made him grieve the more, was, In that the Jews were his <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Kinsmen,</hi> and therefore their misery could not but go the more near to his heart. Another thing which aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his grief, was, the Consideration of those peculiar Priviledges and Glories which are to be affirmed of the Jewish Nation. Two of which are mentioned in this verse:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Theirs are the Fathers.</hi> h. e. They were descended from those blessed Patriarchs, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> Now it is a very sad thing to consider, that the Children and Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </abbr> The <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the Son of God, and the <hi>personal Union</hi> between his two natures.</p>

            <p>In the doctrinal handling of this great Truth, <hi>two</hi> things may be enquired into. (1) How it does appear that the Son of God became <hi>Man.</hi> (2) The Reason why he did so.</p>
            <p>QUEST. I. <hi>How does it appear that the Son of God is</hi> Man, <hi>and not God</hi> only?</p>
            <p>ANSW. 1. <hi>The</hi> Scripture <hi>does expresly and abundantly bear witness to this Truth.</hi> Christ is
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:000416_0086_0FA5B5D2B6A4FF98"/>
expresly called <hi>the MAN Christ Jesus,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. He said to to the Jews, <hi>ye seek to kill a</hi> Man <hi>that</hi> has <hi>told you the truth.</hi> Joh. 8. 40. And he is styled <hi>the Son of</hi> Man. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 13. He is set forth by that Name about fourty times in the <hi>New-Testament.</hi> And he is said to be the son of <hi>David,</hi> Mat. 1. 1. And the son of the <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi> Christ as <hi>God</hi> had no Mother. As <hi>man</hi> He was without <hi>Fatuher,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> without <hi>Mother.</hi> Inasmuch therefore, as the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> is said to be his <hi>mother,</hi> he is <hi>man</hi> as well as God. And the Scripture saith that he was born of a <hi>woman</hi> Gal. 4. 4. And he is called the <hi>seed</hi> of the <hi>Woman,</hi> Gen. 3. 15, And he is called by the name of <hi>Adam:</hi> He is the <hi>last Adam,</hi> 1. Cor. 15. 45. And it is said, <hi>the second</hi> Man <hi>was the Lord from Heaven,</hi> ver. 47. Therefore he is as truly <hi>man</hi> as the <hi>first</hi> Adam was. The Scriptures affirm of him, that He became <hi>Flesh.</hi> Without Controversy, <hi>great</hi> is the <hi>mystery</hi> of Godliness, <hi>God manifest in the flesh,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16.

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Humane (sinless)</hi> Infirmities <hi>are affirmed of Christ.</hi> Therefore he is <hi>man</hi> as well as God. Indeed, as for those <hi>sinful Infirmities</hi> which we are so miserably subject unto, Christ had none of them; but other Infirmities he once had,

The Son of God is not only in the <hi>likeness</hi> of flesh, for he is made <hi>real</hi> flesh but only <hi>like sinful</hi> flesh: As the <hi>Brazen</hi> Serpent was like a Serpent, but had no poison in it; so Christ was like unto sinful flesh, but never had the least degree of sin in his holy nature. Only as to <hi>other</hi> Infirmities he was as all other men are. Its true, that there are many perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal infirmityes of men which Christ had not experience of: there are many <hi>Diseases</hi> which particular persons are afflicted with, that Christ was never subject to, but the <hi>general</hi> infirmities of humane nature, he did subject unto. e. g. To <hi>Hunger, Thirst, Weariness,</hi> &amp;c. which are the general Infirmities of our nature. And so it was with Christ when in this world. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 2. Indeed now he is entred into his <hi>glory,</hi> he is not subject to <hi>any</hi> infirmity; but during his state of humiliation he was so.

He hath flesh and bones, (<hi>glorified</hi> flesh) now in heaven: And therefore a <hi>glorious</hi> body; for so does the Scripture declare and teach us to believe. We have a Saviour in heaven, <hi>who shall change our vile bodyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they be fashioned like unto his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body.</hi> Phil. 3. 21.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We may for the further Confirmation of this Truth, <hi>take notice how it has been mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously signify.</hi> In the dayes of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Son of God did sometimes appear in the form of a man to the Patriarchs; So he did to <hi>Abraham;</hi> and so to, <hi>Jacob</hi> and to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi> and others (and some think that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the likeness that he was to take) we do not read that God the <hi>Father</hi> or that God the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> did ever appear in a <hi>humane shape</hi> to the Fathers, only <hi>God the Son</hi> did so: thereby to signify his future <hi>Incarnation;</hi> that in due time he would <hi>really</hi> be, as then he <hi>seem'd</hi> to be.</p>

And this Truth is still mysteriously signifyed by that Ordinance of the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi> The bread signifies the <hi>Body</hi> and the Wine the <hi>Bloud</hi> of Christ: And that Sacramental Action of <hi>Taking</hi> the Bread in order to the <hi>Consecration</hi> thereof, puts us in mind of Christ's taking our nature. That's a
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:000416_0093_0FA5B5DA05BA6670"/>
Meditation which should be in our hearts, as we see the Minister take the bread in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the <hi>Blessing</hi> &amp; <hi>Breaking</hi> of it, we should then think of Christ's <hi>Incarnation,</hi> that the Son of God has assumed our nature, that so he might <hi>dye</hi> for our sakes</p>
            <p>We come therefore to enquire into the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Reas. 1. <hi>The Word was made flesh, because it was the Will of the Father to have it so.</hi> We have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly treated of the Covenant of <hi>Redemption,</hi> &amp; then was shewed that this was one Article i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that Covenant, that the <hi>Son of God</hi> should take unto him the nature of Man. The Father said to Him, If thou willt be a Redeemer for sinful Man, thou must <hi>thy self</hi> become a man, and in that nature do what concerns a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer to perform. In Compliance with this Will of the Father, <hi>the Son of God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in the flesh,</hi> Heb. 10. 5, 7. Joh. 14. <hi>ult<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>
            <p>Reason 2. <hi>That so he might be a fit</hi> Mediator <hi>between GOD and the children of</hi> men. <hi>There is one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.</hi> 1. Tim. 2. 5. Hence Christ was fit to be a <hi>dayes man</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> speaketh) Between them both. It was altogether ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:000416_0094_0FA5B5DB9CCEB5C8"/>
that the Mediator should be <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> If Christ had been man <hi>only</hi> he could not have been a Mediator; He could not have saved one sinner, nor satisfyed for one sin. And if he had not been a <hi>man,</hi> but God <hi>only,</hi> He could not have been a <hi>Mediator.</hi> He that sanctifyeth and they that are sancctify<hi>ed,</hi> are <hi>all one,</hi> i. e. <hi>of one &amp; the same nature</hi> Heb. 2. 11. Since the <hi>Elect</hi> are partakers of flesh &amp; blood, He Himself took part of the same: Otherwise he could not have dyed, nor have made Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation for the sins of his people. Except he had been made <hi>Flesh,</hi> He could not have shed His <hi>blood</hi> to make attonement for sinners.</p>
            <p>USE. 1. <hi>We must conclude that Ignorance or Error about this great</hi> Truth; <hi>is of dangerous Consequence to the souls of men.</hi> It is indeed a Fundamental Article in our Christian Faith, the Knowledge whereof is necessary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is strange to consider, that any who live under the Gospel, should be ignorant of such a plain, easy, common principle of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: nevertheless there are such. I have discoursed with some that goe under the name of Christians, that yet could not tell whether Christ were God or man, but when asked the question, have replyed that he was only

               <hi>God,</hi> as supposing that a man could not save them. But such dark and horrid Ignorance will be destructive to the souls of men. There are also, who tho' they do in words acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be a great Truth, that <hi>the Son of God became a man;</hi> Nevertheless they hold such, errors as are not well consistent with the Truth which they profess. So do they who maintain the <hi>real Presence</hi> of the Body of Christ in the <hi>Sacrament:</hi> which is to say that Christ's Body hath not the true nature of a Body, and in effect to say, that He has only a <hi>divine</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He that takes away the <hi>Propertyes</hi> of an humane nature denies that nature. A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> if Christ has no other nature but that which is in <hi>all</hi> places, then He hath only a <hi>divine</hi> nature. There are also a sort of men in the world, who hold that there is no Christ but what is <hi>within;</hi> and that Salvation is to be had, not from a <hi>Christ without,</hi> but from at Christ <hi>within.</hi> My Brethren, take heed of such errors, they that maintain them, let them pretend what they will, they deny the <hi>Humanity</hi> of Christ, and so overthrow the Faith, and subvert the <hi>souls</hi> of them that shall be so miserable as to give any Credit to their <hi>strong Delusions.</hi>

Heb. 2. 11. And therefore He bids Believers come and be familiar with Him; and that the Terrour of His infinite Majesty should not make them affraid. When <hi>Joseph'</hi>s Brethren being Conscious to themselves of their own great Guiltiness, were affraid &amp; troubled at his presence, He said to them, <hi>Come near to me I pray you, I am</hi> Joseph <hi>your Brother.</hi> Gen. 45. 4.

And the Son of God who is made man does therefore invite us to his blessed Table, because He would have us humbly Familiar with him, yea and with God through Christ.

All <hi>other humane</hi> natures are distinct persons of <hi>themselves,</hi> but the humane nature of <hi>Christ</hi> is not so: For then there would be <hi>Four</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the Godhead; <hi>Three</hi> of them <hi>eternal,</hi> and one of them <hi>made</hi> of a <hi>woman</hi> in the Fulness of <hi>time.</hi> We must therefore know, that there is in Christ, a <hi>personal Union,</hi> but not an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Persons;</hi> and a Union of <hi>natures,</hi> yet <hi>not</hi> a Union of <hi>Persons.</hi> The Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Christ did not subsist <hi>one moment,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its being <hi>united</hi> to the Son of God, the <hi>second</hi> Person in the Trinity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The human Nature of Christ does subsist <hi>Inseparably</hi> as well as personally with the Son of God. This Union is an <hi>everlasting</hi> Union. The <hi>humane</hi> Nature never did exist one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before its being united to the <hi>divine,</hi> nor ever shall be <hi>dis</hi>united from it. As long as <hi>God</hi> shall be <hi>God,</hi> so long shall the personal union of Christ's <hi>humane</hi> nature with the <hi>divine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.

Hence the Scripture speaks of God's <hi>Suffering</hi> and <hi>Dying.</hi> God bought the Church with his own blood. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Hereby perceive we the Love of God, because he laid down his Life</hi> 1.

A <hi>Bishop,</hi> 1. Pet. 2. <hi>ult,</hi> A <hi>Minister,</hi> Heb. 8. 1, 6. A <hi>Priest,</hi> a <hi>Prophet,</hi> a <hi>King.</hi> (as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards may more fully be declared.) Now all these Names are of <hi>Office.</hi> Moreover, those things which are required to constitute an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, are hereby truly affirmed concerning <hi>Christ.</hi> Three Things have been observed as <hi>Requisites</hi> in one that is invested into Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Office.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Qualifications.</hi> God does first <hi>Fit</hi> men for their Work before he puts them upon it, He never sent any man upon an Errand, but gave him legs to go upon. Now thus it is true, concerning the man Christ Jesus. He, (and he only) is wonderfully qualifyed for the Work of Mediation which my Text speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of. In the Temple (which was a Type of Christ) there were Utensils for every Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice required therein. This signifying, that Christ. (the True Temple) was <hi>every</hi> way furnished for all that work, which as a
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:000416_0129_0FA5B53F6677FDF0"/>
Mediator is incumbent on Him. Hence he is said to be <hi>Anoynted,</hi> Psal 45 2. The Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Messiah,</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> word, <hi>Christ,</hi> is <hi>Anointed.</hi> How? not <hi>materially</hi> but Spiritually; <hi>h. e.</hi> in respect of spiritual Qualifications and endowments fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him for his Work. The gifts of the Holy Spirit were most plentifully poured on Him. <hi>Isai.</hi> 11. 1, 2, 3. There never was man or Angel, that had such gifts of the Spirit as Christ (considered as man) hath. And as to <hi>Grace and Holiness,</hi> he is admirably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed and qualifyed, <hi>He is full of Grace, so as that of his fullness we have all received, and that grace for grace: for God giveth not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by measure unto him.</hi> Joh. 1. 14, 16. and 3. 34.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another thing required to Constitute an Officer is an <hi>outward Call.</hi> Inward Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without <hi>external Vocation</hi> is not enough to make an Officer. No man ought to take that Honour to himself except he be called of God, as was <hi>Aaron.</hi> Heb. 5. 4. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officers have their Call from God by <hi>man:</hi> and <hi>Extra</hi>ordinary Officers have their Call <hi>immediately</hi> from <hi>God:</hi> as the Apostle does distinguish, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 1. Christ had his Call from God, who did (to speak after the
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:000416_0130_0FA5B5402CEAF278"/>
manner of Men) give Him a Commission, as it were under hand and Seal, to undertake the Work of a Redeemer. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 22. <hi>for him has God the Father Sealed.</hi> And of him does God say, <hi>I the Lord have called thee in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and will give thee for a Covenant to the people.</hi> Isai. 42. 6. Therefore he may be <hi>well</hi> called the <hi>Mediator of the new Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In order to Consummating sacred Office<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Relation, <hi>Consecration,</hi> and solemn <hi>Separation</hi> is necessary. <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons were to be <hi>consecrated to the Lord, that they might minister in the</hi> Priests Office. <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 30. And the Holy Ghost said, <hi>separate</hi> me <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> for the work whereunto I have <hi>called</hi> them. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 2. God Himself hath Consecrated his Son Jesus Christ to the work of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. <hi>The Son is consecrated for ever more.</hi> Heb. 7. 28. <hi>Him the Father hath Sanctified and sent into the world.</hi> Joh. 10. 31. Yea, and Jesus has set <hi>Himself</hi> apart for the Work of a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator between God and the Elect. Therefore he saith, <hi>For your sakes I sanctify my self,</hi> Joh. 17. 19. There is a Sanctification in respect of Consecration and Separation to the Service of God: which glorious Mystery is indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Administration of the Lord's
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:000416_0131_0FA5B540DCDE7120"/>
Supper. For when the Elements are separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and solemnly consecrated, we are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by taught that Christ hath been set apart as <hi>the Mediator of the new-Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this will appear further by speaking to the next Proposition.</p>
            <p>Propos. IV. <hi>The Father has committed the Work of Redemption to the Son of God: who hath accordingly undertaken that Charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) I say the, Father has <hi>committed</hi> that work of Christ. God has said to his Son, As for the work of <hi>Redemption,</hi> I leave <hi>that</hi> to <hi>thee</hi> do <hi>thou</hi> take care of that matter. Upon this account it is, that Christ is said to receive a Commandment and Charge from God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Joh. 14. 21. <hi>As the Father gave me Commandment</hi> (said Christ when he was going to dy for the Redemption of his Elect) <hi>even so do I.</hi> He neither <hi>Did</hi> nor <hi>Suffered</hi> any thing in order to the Salvation of his people but what God <hi>bid</hi> him do. Hence all the work which Christ did in the world, is said to be, the work which the <hi>Father gave him to do.</hi> Joh. 17. 4. On this account he is said to be infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the Father; not in respect of <hi>nature,</hi> as he is the <hi>Son</hi> of God, but as he is the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</hi> Joh. 10. 29. Yea, he is God's
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:000416_0132_0FA5B54325D69988"/>
               <hi>Commissioner.</hi> (To express heavenly Mysteries by earthly Similitudes) He hath the <hi>great Seal of Heaven</hi> to Authorize him to act as MEDIATOR. Hence he is called the Lord's <hi>Messenger,</hi> Mal. 3. 1. And in <hi>John'</hi>s <hi>Gospel</hi> Christ is said to be <hi>sent of God,</hi> no less than twenty times over.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) Jesus Christ has <hi>accepted</hi> this Charge. Tho it be the greatest Work, and weighty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Charge that ever was, yet Christ (who alone was able) hath undertaken it. This might serve for a Description of Christ's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial Office, <hi>It is that</hi> Charge <hi>which He hath undertaken in order to the Salvation of the Elect.</hi> Tho he be in respect of nature, <hi>equal</hi> with God, he took upon him the form of a <hi>Servant.</hi> And being found in fashion as a man, he became obedient unto Death, Hence Christ is styled a <hi>Surety. Jesus is made</hi> a Surety <hi>of a better Testament.</hi> Heb. 7. 22. which implyes the same thing with this of his being <hi>the Mediator of the new Covenant.</hi> God saith, My Law must be fulfilled, and my Justice must be satisfied: now Christ the Son of GOD comes in, and sayes, As for those things, I'le undertake to see them alone. He engageth to do that for them, which they are never able to do for <hi>themselves.</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="unknown:000416_0133_0FA5B5448AE45C50"/>

God ruleth over all: but by Christ, into whose hands all things are committed by the Father. Therefore <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in that glorious vision, <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>saw a Throne and a</hi> man <hi>upon it.</hi> Signifying that Christ as <hi>man</hi> &amp; <hi>Mediator</hi> has the Government of the world put into his hands, to dispose of all affairs so as shall be to the glory of the Father, and the good and Salvation of his people. But eminently</p>
            <p>Christ is said to be a <hi>Mediator</hi> in respect of his <hi>Priestly</hi> Office. Hence he is called <hi>Jesus</hi> the <hi>Mediator.</hi> Why <hi>Jesus?</hi> because the great design of the Apostle in his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is to describe the Priesthood of Christ. Now, <hi>Jesus</hi> is a Name which does respect and note Christ's priestly Office. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>We have a great high priest that is passed into the Heavens, [JESUS] the Son of God.</hi> The Priest under the Law, did <hi>two</hi> things especially.</p>

When God was offended, if the Priest did offer Sacrifice for the people, He was pacified towards them. Now that was with respect to the Sacrifice of <hi>Christ.</hi> For it was not possible that those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sacrifices should of themselves expiate

the guilt of the least Sin. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 4. Christ then is said to be a Mediator inasmuch as he has by the Sacrifice of <hi>Himself</hi> purged away our Sins, and obtained our peace with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10, 11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The priest offered <hi>Incense.</hi> So Christ hath not only made <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> but He does make <hi>Intercession</hi> 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1, 2.

               </gap> If the Priest should have only offered <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critice,</hi> and not gone into the Holy place to offer <hi>Incense,</hi> he would not have done His whole work; so if Christ had not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated the Mercy of God for Sinners by <hi>Intercession</hi> as well as Sacrifice, He would not be a perfect Priest: which thing is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apostle, when he saith concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ, <hi>If He were on earth he should not be a Priest,</hi> Heb, 8. 4. Because should he have continued on earth and not gone to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven there to intercede for his people, He would have done but halfe the Work of a Priest.</p>

            </p>

man or <hi>Angel</hi> could go through with it: But since it is in the hand of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> the Son of GOD, there's no fear of miscarriage. If it were trusted in any other hand, woe would be to thee and to me, and to all the world for ever. But it is not possible it should mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry in <hi>Christ's</hi> hand. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 24. Now this is a great Comfort. Suppose a man to be miserably in <hi>Debt;</hi> If a Surety interpose that is able to pay the Debt, that's a Comfort to him: even so is the Case here.</p>
            <p>Consid. 2. <hi>Jesus Christ is a</hi> Willing <hi>Mediator,</hi> Poor souls are apt to be discouraged, not so much in respect of the power of Christ, which they doubt not of, as from his <hi>Will</hi> to save them. They are ready to say as the <hi>Leper</hi> did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 3. <hi>Lord, if thou</hi> wilt <hi>thou canst make me clean.</hi> But know, Christ is <hi>willing</hi> to reconcile thee to God, if thou art will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>be</hi> reconciled to him. Christ by his Messengers, <hi>beseecheth</hi> Sinners to be reconciled unto God. He began the work of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at first most Willingly: He hath gone through the greatest and heaviest part of his Work with much Willingness. He laid down his life of <hi>Himself,</hi> there was none took it from him against his will. That work of
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:000416_0157_0FA5B5607AFE9D88"/>
Suffering for Sin, and Satisfying divine Justice is done: and therefore we may besure, he is willing to attend what remaines respecting the work of <hi>Intercession.</hi> If thou are a <hi>comer</hi> to him, He is willing to intercede for thee. He is ready to put in a good word for thee in heaven before the Father of Glory. He <hi>liveth</hi> for that end. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25.</p>
            <p>Consid. 3. <hi>Now there is a</hi> Mediator <hi>for poor Sinners whose Mediation is</hi> Meritorious. It is so because, <hi>Jesus</hi> is the Mediator. There's Merit in the Bloud of Christ, for he is the Son of GOD. Had we none but saints or Angels to Mediate for us, we were in a said case, because <hi>they</hi> can't <hi>merit.</hi> But <hi>Christ</hi> has merited all saving good for all his. He is a Redeemer by <hi>Price.</hi> As for the Elect, He has bought every one of them, body and soul, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20.

Indeed, If a man come to God without <hi>Christ,</hi> let him not think that he shall receive any thing.

            <p>IN this Chapter, there are <hi>two</hi> Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>Sermon</hi> preached by <hi>John Baptist:</hi> whereby he doth prepare his Auditors for Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Christ's Baptism:</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Evangelist has recorded <hi>three</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Providences, which did at that time come to pass.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="158" facs="unknown:000416_0164_0FA5B565AFB2E448"/>1. The Opening of the Heavens, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. No doubt but the Heavens were really opened, by the infinite power of the Almighty: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by may be signifyed, that <hi>Heaven</hi> which was shutt against all the Children of fallen man is opened to them now, <hi>in</hi> and <hi>by</hi> Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another miraculous Thing which did attend the Baptism of Christ was, that the Holy Ghost did visibly descend upon them like a Dove. <hi>(ibid.)</hi> And this might be, that so the Prophesy of <hi>Isaiah</hi> might be fulfilled <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally</hi> as well as spiritually, <hi>Cap.</hi> 61. 1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is come upon me.</hi> Also there by to Intimate, how Christ was filled was the Spirit of Innocency and Meekness.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There was a miraculous <hi>Voice</hi> which came from God out of Heaven; and that is expressed in this verse, wherein we have a most glorious, Divine Testimony concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ: GOD from Heaven does here testify <hi>two</hi> things of Him:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That He is <hi>His Son,</hi> yea, His <hi>Beloved</hi> Son. <hi>He</hi> is so His <hi>Son,</hi> as none else is; so <hi>Beloved,</hi> as none else is. Angels are the sons of God, but they only in respect of <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Believers</hi> are the Sons of God, but in respect of Adoption: Whereas <hi>Christ</hi> is
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:000416_0165_0FA5B56676820A60"/>
not the son of God on those accounts, but in respect of nature. And therefore Jesus Christ is more dear to God than all Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God does here testi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ie concerning his Son Jesus Christ, that he is <hi>well pleased</hi> In <hi>Him:</hi> Now this pleasure of the Father in Christ, doth intimate not only, that GOD taketh infinite <hi>Delight</hi> in Christ, (though <hi>that</hi> be part of what is intended, these words alluding to <hi>Isa.</hi> 42. 1. and 62. 4.) but also that the Father hath received <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> in <hi>and</hi> by <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Hence, It is not said <hi>I am well pleased</hi> with <hi>him,</hi> but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p n="1">1. It is evident in that God hath <hi>decreed</hi> &amp; <hi>declared</hi> that <hi>Sin</hi> shall be <hi>punished.</hi> There is an Eternal Decree concerning this Thing. Now upon a suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Decree of God, that Sin shall be <hi>punished,</hi> it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily followes that the Event will be accordingly. For the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God are <hi>unchangeable:</hi> Hence are they <hi>fitly</hi> compared

               <hi>to mountains of brass.</hi> Zech. 6. 1. Also this Decree is <hi>published,</hi>
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> In the written Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. Yea, When God made man at at first, He did peremptorily declare that <hi>Sin</hi> should be punished with <hi>Death.</hi> Gen. 2. 17. Wherefore the Apostle saith, that <hi>It is appointed unto men once to</hi> dye, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. There is a <hi>Statute law</hi> which must take place, <hi>sc.</hi> that in Gen. 2. 17. So that it cannot stand with the Wisedom nor with the Veracity of God to pardon sin without Satisfaction; He having decreed and declared otherwise.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Demonstration is, <hi>that God's pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ut from his</hi> Nature. Hence there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Satisfaction, If God punish sin only <hi>voluntarily,</hi> there would not be such a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Satisfaction as indeed there is. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is from the Nature &amp; essential Justice of God that Sin is punished, as appears</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In that when the Scripture speaketh of God's Punishing Sin, it is ascribed not only to his</hi> Will, <hi>but to his</hi> just Nature. <hi>Psal.</hi> 11. 6. 7. The <hi>Psalmist</hi> giveth it as the Reason why God does punish the Wicked, even because he is <hi>righteous.</hi> The Nature of God is such, as that he cannot but love Righteousness, and so hate &amp; punish Wickedness. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 5. 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 6.</p>

               <pb n="162" facs="unknown:000416_0168_0FA5B56B29E910A0"/>2. It is Evident in that <hi>God is the</hi> SU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PREAM <hi>Governour and Judge of All.</hi> Gen. 18. 25. Rom. 3. 5, 6. God hath not only an absolute Soveraignty over his creatures, in respect whereof He may punish or spare, kill or keep alive; but He is moreover a <hi>Judge,</hi> in respect whereof it is necessary he should pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the guilty. It is necessary to a Judge to punish where the Law requires him so to do.

               </gap> that deserved Death, but escaped it from the hands of men. Such a notion was implanted in their minds, that, there is a GOD who will take Vengeance for Sin. From this it came to pass that the Gentiles had so many Sacrifices, thinking that this would pacify a provoked God. And from this principle it is, that the Consciencies of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners do secretly sting them &amp; condemn them, when they do evil in the sight of God, <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> 2. 15. Now Conscience is a man's Judging of himself, as God will judge him forever. Yea, and from this principle it is, that when men do apprehend themselves any wayes injured, they appeal to <hi>God</hi> to right them. Surely, there would not be such a presumption in the minds of <hi>all</hi> men that God will punish sin, if his punishing thereof did proceed meerly from an Act of his Will, and not from an essential property of His Nature.

               <pb n="165" facs="unknown:000416_0171_0FA5B56EA0AAD6B8"/>
without any special Revelation, which shows that it proceeds <hi>not</hi> meerly from the <hi>Will,</hi> but from the righteous <hi>Nature</hi> of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>If God's Punishing Sin be meerly from his</hi> Will, <hi>then it would follow, that he is as free to</hi> reward <hi>sin as to</hi> punish <hi>it.</hi> That Sin or <hi>no</hi> Sin is all one him: for all the meerly-free Acts of God's Will <hi>might</hi> have been <hi>otherwise.</hi> And then whereas he doth will men to <hi>love</hi> &amp; <hi>serve</hi> him, He <hi>might</hi> have will'd them to <hi>hate</hi> &amp; <hi>oppose</hi> him, and that no punishment should have been due to them on the account of any Disobedience: but this cannot stand with the nature of God.</p>

the death of a <hi>man. Only</hi> the Scriptures do most clearly &amp; abundantly reveal this Truth: we shall therefore keep close to the Scripture in producing Arugments for the Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Doctrine before us.</p>
            <p>Arg. I. <hi>All those Sriptures which speak of God being pacified by Christ, prove that he hath satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed the Father.</hi> For that is intended by the Satisfaction of Christ, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That He hath done that whereby God is <hi>pacified</hi> towards His people; all their sins and Injuries offered to him thereby, notwithstanding. But this the Scripture speaketh abundantly of. Hence God is said to be <hi>pleased</hi> in <hi>and</hi> by <hi>Him,</hi> as as we have heard the Text before us express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Hence we read of <hi>Reconciliation</hi> by <hi>Christ,</hi> 2. Cor. 5. 19. Rom. 5. 10. And of <hi>Peace</hi> with God through <hi>Christ.</hi> Cap. 5. 1. Col. 1. 20. And of <hi>Attonement</hi> by Christ. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 11. And of Christ's being a <hi>Propitiation,</hi> Cap. 3. 25. 1. Joh. 2. 2.

<pb n="168" facs="unknown:000416_0174_0FA5B570D8A70130"/>
therefore we are said to be reconciled and at peace with God by Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Arg. II. <hi>All those Scriptures which speake of Jesus Christ's being offered on the account of the sins of his people, evince the Truth of this Doctrine of Christ's</hi> SATISFACTION. For that was the end of Christs being made an Offering for Sin, that Satisfaction to divine Justice might thereby be accomplished. In the Scriptures Christ is said to be an <hi>Oblation,</hi> Heb. 10. 10 &amp; 9. 28. And <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> ver. 26. 1. Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. 7. On the same account Christ is called a <hi>Lamb,</hi> Joh. 1. 29. And an <hi>Altar,</hi> Heb. 13. 10. And this was the great intendment of all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices under the Law, even to hold forth the Satisfaction of Christ. When they were offered God was pacifyed towards his Sinning people: see 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 19. <hi>If the Lord have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> q. d. Let Him be <hi>appeased</hi> or <hi>satisfyed</hi> therewith: see also 2. Sam. 24. 25. <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 20. 26. <hi>The Lord smelled a sweet savour.</hi> The Expression intimates that God was well pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that Offering. Now those Sacrifices could not of themselves satisfy or appease the the wrath of God, it was not possible that they should, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 4. only as they were Types of
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:000416_0175_0FA5B571E74859C8"/>
Christ, and did put the Lord in mind of the Sacrifices of the <hi>New</hi> Testament in due time to be offered. God was pacified towards Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers under the Old Testament on the account of <hi>this</hi> Sacrifice which was to take place when the <hi>Fulness of time</hi> should come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15.</p>
            <p>Arg. III. <hi>All those Scriptures which speak of Christ's bring a</hi> Redeemer, <hi>do evince the Doctrine of His Satisfaction to Divine Justice.</hi> Tit. 2. 14. For Christ is a Redeemer, not only by <hi>Power</hi> but by <hi>Price.</hi> Hence his people are said to be <hi>bought</hi> by him, yea, <hi>bought with a</hi> Price. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>

               </gap>. Nothing can be spoken more clear and express to prove that Christ is a Redeemer, not by <hi>Power</hi> only, but by <hi>Price</hi> also. Hence the Elect of God are said to be <hi>ransomed,</hi> Matth. 20. 28. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. The <hi>Greek</hi> word <hi>[antilutron]</hi> there used, signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the laying down of a just valuable price, even as much as the Thing is worth.

               <pb n="170" facs="unknown:000416_0176_0FA5B5724A5314E8"/>Arg. IV. <hi>All those Scriptures which speak of Sins being done away by the blood of Christ, prove that his Death was Satisfactory.</hi> Hence the Sins of his people are said to be <hi>purged</hi> away thereby. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. And <hi>washed</hi> away, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. And their souls <hi>sprinkled</hi> therewith to the cleansing of them from the Guilt and Filth of sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. That which doth avail to the removing of the Guilt of sin, and so of the punishment due thereunto, is <hi>satisfactory</hi> to Divine Justice, but this we see is true of the Death of Christ.</p>
            <p>Arg. 5. <hi>All those Scriptures which speak of</hi> Christ's standing in our stead <hi>prove the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of His</hi> Satisfaction <hi>to Divine Justice.</hi> He stands in <hi>our stead.</hi> He is called a <hi>Surety,</hi> Heb. 7. 22. And is said to <hi>dye</hi> for us. 2. Cor. 5. 14, 15. h. e. not only for our benefit but in our <hi>room. For</hi> us, i. e. <hi>instead</hi> of us. 2. Sam. 18. 33. Rom. 5. 6, 7.

            <p>Reas. 1. <hi>From the Dignity of Christ's</hi> Person. He is the <hi>SON of GOD,</hi> as the Text, expresseth; and thence a Person of Infinite Worth and Dignity, which doth add value to His Sufferings and Satisfaction. It is true that the <hi>Humane</hi> nature only suffered, (if we speak <hi>strictly</hi>) all Passion being incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible to the <hi>Divine</hi> Nature, nevertheless by Reason of the <hi>personal Union</hi> between the two Natures of Christ, that which does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong to <hi>one</hi> nature is truly affirmed of the <hi>Person.</hi> It is therefore most true that the Second Person of the Trinity, even the <hi>Son of GOD</hi> Himself, became subject to the poenalty of the Law, in order to the appeas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the wrath and satisfying the Justice of

What Christ hath done in order to Salvation, He did as <hi>Mediator;</hi> and therefore not as <hi>God only</hi> nor as <hi>man only</hi> but as <hi>God-man.</hi> Now for <hi>such</hi> a Person to become sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the poenalty of the Law, and to the Wrath of God, is (as I have else-where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed) more than if all Men and Angels had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And whereas the Beauty of Christ is compared <hi>with</hi> and preferred <hi>to</hi> that of any of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>men,</hi> that sheweth that the words are not to be interpreted of Christ in respect of his <hi>Deity,</hi> for <hi>so</hi> His Excellency admits of <hi>no</hi> Comparison, but <hi>of</hi> him as the Son of <hi>man,</hi> 'Tis meant of a <hi>communicated</hi> Beauty, even a glory which the <hi>humane</hi> nature of Christ is for ever blessed with, as the last words in the verse intimate.</p>

            <p>ANSW. <hi>The Scriptures do abundantly bear Witness to the Truth of this Doctrine.</hi> Hence Christ is said to be anointed above all others. In the seventh verse of this Psalm. tis said. <hi>God thy God has anointed thee with the oyl of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness above thy fellows.</hi> The humane Nature of Christ, is a Creature, but it hath an Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which maketh it excel all its fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Hence the Man Christ Jesus is said to be. <hi>The Prince of the Kings of the earth,</hi> Rev. 1. 5. i. e.

And the Scripture saith of the man Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, that he must <hi>in all things have the preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

all men and Angels. As the Elect of God are styled <hi>the Church of the first-born,</hi> Heb. 12. 23. importing their Dignity above others, so the Man <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> is indeed <hi>the first-born</hi> of <hi>the first-born;</hi> the most excellent one of all those that are near and dear to God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Christ as man has a larger measure of the</hi> Holy Spirit <hi>than ever was communicated to any Creature.</hi> In that respect He is said to be <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed with oyl</hi> above <hi>his follows:</hi> as in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but now mentioned.

a measure of the Spirit as is possible to be communicated to a man or Creature. Hence tis said that, all <hi>Fulness</hi> dwells in him. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>For it pleased the Father that in</hi> Him <hi>all</hi> Fulness <hi>should dwell.</hi> As for <hi>that</hi> Fulness which dwells in Him as <hi>God,</hi> it cannot be said properly, that it was <hi>the pleasure of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> that it should be in Him. But this is true with respect to the Fulness, which dwells in him as <hi>man and mediator.</hi> There is a Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of spiritual Gifts in the man Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. He hath a geater measure of Wisdom &amp; knowledge than ever man or Angel did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>In whom are hid all the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge.</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Wisdome, yea, <hi>all</hi> Treasures thereof are in him, i. e. not only objectively in that the wisdome of God does appear in the Mystery of Christ more than in any thing, but all Treasures of Wisdom are in Him <hi>subjectively:</hi> As <hi>man</hi> he has the vastest measure of Knowledge that ever was contained in a finite Understanding. It is written concerning <hi>Solomon,</hi> That he was wiser than all men, and that GOD gave him Understanding <hi>exceeding much,</hi> and Largeness of heart even as the Sand that is on the Sea-Shore.

                  </gap> Solomon</hi> was a Type of Christ. Yet let me say, Solomon had a very shallow understanding and Comprehension of things, if compared with the man Christ Jesus. Christ's Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is a thousand times greater than ever <hi>Solomons</hi> was, or than ever any other man attain'd unto. And the <hi>Soul</hi> of Christ is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed and adorned with all spiritual Graces, in the Highest degree that can be. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Isaiah</hi> saw the Lord sitting upon a Throne, and his train filled the Temple: There are a train of glorious <hi>Graces</hi> which fill the Temple of Christ's humane Nature. There is no other man on earth or in heaven hath so much grace but it is possible for him to have yet more; but the man <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> is so full of Grace, as that it is impossible for him to have more. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>The Word was made flesh, and dwelt amongst us</hi> full of Grace <hi>and truth.</hi> Yea, and <hi>of his Fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.</hi> ver. 16. What aglorious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible fulness of Grace is that! To have so much fulness of Grace, as to be able to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part thereof to <hi>all</hi> the Elect of God. Christ is as full of Grace, as a <hi>Fountain</hi> is full of <hi>water.</hi>
               <pb n="189" facs="unknown:000416_0193_0FA5B58703F18198"/>
Yea, as full of <hi>Grace,</hi> as the Sun is full of <hi>Light:</hi> for which cause He is styled the <hi>Sun of Righteousness.</hi> Mal. 4. 2. And he said of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>I am the</hi> Light <hi>of the world.</hi> Joh. 8. 12. There are some Believers who have received a large measure of spiritual gifts &amp; graces, but have it all from <hi>Christ.</hi> How full is <hi>He</hi> then! We read in <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 11, 12. Of <hi>two Olive trees by the candlestick, which empty the golden oyl out of themselves.</hi> In the Type, <hi>Jushua</hi> &amp; <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> were <hi>the sons of oyl,</hi> who did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the gifts and graces which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, for the benefit of the Candlestick of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church: So Christ is alwayes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting of that fullness which he has received to Believers, and to His Churches, through the golden Pipes of his Ordinances. Then what an unmeasureable Fulness of the Grace of the Spirit has the Lord Jesus received! There is in Christ an inexhaustible Ocean of Grace. Believers are said to have Rivers of Grace flowing into their hearts, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 38. But Christ hath an <hi>Ocean</hi> of Grace flowing in <hi>His</hi> blessed heart. As all Rivers come from the Sea; so all those Rivers of <hi>Grace</hi> in the souls of believers are derived from that <hi>Sea</hi> of Grace which is in Jesus Christ.</p>

And thence the Man Jesus when he conversed among mortals in this lower world, He was wont to speak like a God. He did ordinarily express himself after such a manner as never man did the like. Speaking of <hi>God</hi> he said, <hi>My Father workes hitherto, and I work,</hi> Joh. 5. 17.

Did <hi>God</hi> make the World? So did <hi>I,</hi> said Christ: Doth God preserve the world? So doe <hi>I:</hi> does God quicken whom He will? So doe <hi>I,</hi> sayes Jesus. When the <hi>Jews</hi> heard him that was a <hi>man</hi> talking after such a rate, they thought he was the greatest Blasphemer that ever breathed. And the Truth is, that if any other man that ever liv'd on the earth, should have expressed himself as the Man <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> was went to do, he would have bin guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the highest Blasphemy: but because the Man is <hi>God</hi> as well as Man, all that he spake was <hi>true,</hi> and could not but be true; because of His being <hi>One</hi> in person with God. It was no more possible for that man to speak Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, than for God to lye. If the Man <hi>Jesus</hi> had sinned, it might have been said <hi>God</hi> has sinned, which to imagine is high Blasphemy. A man's Soul is not more truly united to his <hi>Body,</hi> than the <hi>Godhead</hi> is united to the <hi>humane nature</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> which is more than can be said of any creature excepting only the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular <hi>humane nature</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> Now by virtue of the <hi>Hypostatical union,</hi> that Man becometh the Son of GOD. And because He <hi>is</hi> the Son of GOD, all the Glory that possibly can be, becometh His Due: That indeed, when the Man Christ Jesus ascended into heaven, and there sat down at the Right hand of God,
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:000416_0210_0FA5A9F3F4547818"/>
He did but take his place according to the Dignity of his person. And because of this it is but meet that all the Angels in heaven should be made subject to that Man: Yea, and that all creatures in the whole world should be put under his Feet.</p>
