            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> following Sermon is not preſented to the Public, from an idea that it poſſeſſes any peculiar mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, on account of depth of thought; originality of ideas; or beauty of arrangement. The Author, when he wrote it, had not the leaſt idea of its ever thus appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad. But ſuch was the occaſion, upon which it was delivered, that the Church of Haverhill unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly deſired, and continued to deſire a copy of it for the Preſs. And, after declining, for a conſiderable time, the Author complied with their wiſhes, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending, that the truths it contains, may be of ſervice; eſpecially to the Church and People, whom he had left, and for whom he feels a tender concern.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>AUL had preached the Goſpel at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and been the inſtrument of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Church there. He had remained with them for ſeveral years, teaching and admoniſhing them, till he probably viewed them to be <hi>rooted and grounded in the truth.</hi> He then purſued his tour, to preach the glad tidings of ſalvation in the regions round about them. After a while, he found it neceſſary to leave thoſe parts, and to return to Jeruſalem. Upon this journey he touched at Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letus; and from thence he ſent and collected the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church of Epheſus, to addreſs to them his laſt charge; his farewell diſcourſe. This he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces by an appeal to their conſciences, in which he recounts his own miniſterial faithfulneſs among them. "<hi>Ye know from the firſt day that I came into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038515_0004_101248508BF2A3B8"/>
after what manner I have been with you at all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſerving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears and temptations, which befel me by the lying in wait of the Jews; and how I kept, back nothing, which was profitable unto you; but have ſhowed you, and taught you publicly, and from houſe to houſe; teſtifying both to the Jews, and alſo to the Greeks, repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>" He proceeds, and tells them, that he was now going bound in ſpirit to Jeruſalem; <hi>i. e.</hi> convinced in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that God called him thither; that he knew not what trials were to befal him there, except that in every city he was notified, by the Holy Spirit, that bond and afflictions awaited him. But his courage was no<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap>ired. "<hi>None of theſe things move me; neither count I my life dear unto myſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my courſe with joy, and the miniſtry, which I have received, to teſtify the Goſpel of the grace of God.</hi>" Paul then ſuggeſts to them that this was their laſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view on earth; that they ſhould ſee his face here no more. He, therefore, calls on them to bear him witneſs, that he had faithfully cleared himſelf from the blood of ſouls. For he had not concealed from them any part of the revealed counſel of God; but had boldly declared it all. So that, if any at Epheſus now periſhed, their blood muſt be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own heads! Paul, then, ſolemnly enjoins on them <hi>faithfulneſs,</hi> both to themſelves, and to their churches. And to induce them to this, he warns them of approaching dangers. "<hi>For I know, that after my departure, ſhall grievous wolves enter in among you, not ſparing the flock.</hi>" q. d. The enemy will take an advantage from my abſence, and will introduce their favorite teachers; yea, the latter will be ready to introduce themſelves, and to improve ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſubtil argument and opportunity to gain proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, without any regard to the good of ſouls. For, however theſe teachers are adorned with ſheep's clothing, (<hi>i. e.</hi> with great pretences, and ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038515_0005_1012481BB17047D0"/>
of benevolence and religion,) yet they are no better than wolves among ſheep; prowling from fold to fold; caring nothing for the flock; but to gorge their own appetites; and, with <hi>good words, and fair ſpeeches,</hi> to deceive the hearts of the ſimple. Yea, he warns them that ſome of their own members would become perverſe ſchiſmatics; and that diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, (probably from their more looſe and unſtable characters,) would be drawn away after them. He renewedly charges them, therefore, to <hi>watch</hi> and to recollect his warnings, and his care, which for a number of years he had exhibited among them.</p>
            <p>Paul then adds, as in our text; "<hi>And now, breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance among all them, who are ſanctified.</hi>" This he doubtleſs eſteemed a bleſſed privilege, that, inaſmuch as he muſt bid them a final adieu on earth, he might carry them to God, and leave them at his feet.</p>
            <p>Upon the text, it may be ſuitable, at this time, to ſhow,</p>
            <p n="1">I. What was implied in Paul's commending his Epheſian brethren to God, and to the word of his grace. And,</p>
            <p n="2">II. What encouragement he had thus to do. "<hi>Which is able to build you up, &amp;c.</hi>"</p>
            <p>As to the firſt idea, It implied much. It implied his tender affection and concern for them; that he bore them upon his heart; that they were dear to him. It implied, that he was about to leave them. For though it be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>able for chriſtian friends <hi>ever,</hi> though preſent, to commend each other to God; yet this is an expreſſion more peculiarly adapted to a parting ſcene. The Apoſtle was to have the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate charge of them no more. He, therefore, by faith, commits them to God; lays them at his feet, or places them <hi>near</hi> to him, as the word in the orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal, <hi>Paratithemi,</hi> imports. It implies Paul's confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God; in the glory and rectitude of his gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038515_0006_101248531E94CBE0"/>
that God governs all events and things in glorious wiſdom and benevolence. Otherwiſe, Paul would have eſteemed it no privilege to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his dear friends to God; for there would be no ſafety in their lying at his feet. They might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>good</hi> or <hi>ill</hi> treatment; and there would be no foundation for confidence. But Paul's commending them to God implied his full belief, that, under the Divine Government, all things will terminate well; that infinite Power, Wiſdom and Benevolence ſit at helm, and will cauſe that light ſhall, eventually, ſpring out of darkneſs, and order out of confuſion, to the eternal joy and ſalvation of all <hi>the benevolent;</hi> that there is, hence, a glorious foundation for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken confidence in God.</p>
            <p>And his commending them to the word of God's grace, alſo implied much. It implied, that he view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this word as their <hi>guide,</hi> their <hi>polar ſtar,</hi> their <hi>mean</hi> of ſalvation. God could work <hi>without</hi> the means, of which he now makes uſe, if he pleaſed. But it is <hi>not</hi> his will thus to do; but to work <hi>by</hi> means. Certain means are appointed by God, and muſt be attended to by man, <hi>as God directs,</hi> in order that certain ends may be obtained. God of old ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the ark, as the mean of Noah's ſafety from the deluge. He appointed the paſſover, and the ſprinkling of the blood, in Iſrael, as the mean of their ſafety from the ſword of the deſtroying angel. He appointed Moſes' rod, as the mean of producing the plagues upon Egypt; of dividing the Red Sea; and of bringing water from the rock. He appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the brazen ſerpent, as the mean of healing for the bitten, dying Iſraelite. He appointed the blowing of rams' horns by the prieſts, leading the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Iſrael round the walls of Jericho, once a day, for ſeven days; and on the ſeventh day, <hi>ſeven times,</hi> as the mean of the deſtruction of thoſe walls; and of the going in of the choſen tribes to poſſeſs the promiſed land. He appointed the arming of three
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038515_0007_1012481E381AA3F0"/>
hundred men, under Gideon, with trumpets, with pitchers, and lights in them; that they ſhould blow their trumpets, daſh their pitchers, and cry, "<hi>The ſword of the Lord and of Gideon,</hi>" as the mean of rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the numerous hoſts of Iſrael's enemies, who were encamped againſt them.</p>
            <p>And God has, <hi>in like manner,</hi> appointed his word, and the preaching of his Goſpel, as the mean of the ſalvation of ſouls. The two latter inſtances mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were, doubtleſs, lively emblems of this appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To this mean of grace, ſouls muſt attend in love and obedience to God; or they are not in way to heaven. And to this mean of grace, it appears Paul commended his Epheſian brethren. He was ſenſible that "<hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi>" He had fully learned, that it was <hi>by the Goſpel</hi> that ſouls were begotten unto a lively hope; and, <hi>by the word,</hi> that they are waſhed or ſanctified; "<hi>Waſhed in water by the word.</hi>" To this, therefore, Paul joyfully commended his chriſtian friends, when parting from them. I paſs on now to ſhow,</p>
            <p n="2">II. What encouragement he had thus to do. "<hi>Which is able to build you up, and to give you an inher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itance among all them, who are ſanctified.</hi>" The rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>which,</hi> here, may refer either to the antecedent <hi>God</hi>; or the <hi>word</hi> of his grace. And <hi>both</hi> were able thus to build them up; <hi>i. e. God</hi> was infinitely able to do it by his word; and his <hi>word</hi> was able to do it, when he made it ſo, and rendered it a favor of life unto life. Paul was ſenſible, that the word of God was mighty, through the Spirit, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds; and to the deſtroying of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing, which ſtood in the way of their meetneſs for glory; that it was, for this purpoſe, <hi>ſharp</hi> and <hi>powerful, as a two edged ſword.</hi> And knowing this to be God's uſual method, and his ſolemn engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his people; he cheerfully commends them to him for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:038515_0008_10124854C616F9A8"/>Two ideas are contained in the clauſe of the text under conſideration, viz. <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Grace. "<hi>Which is able to build you up." i. e.</hi> Which is able to keep you from falling, until you ſhall be preſented ſpotleſs before the throne of his glory with exceeding joy. Which is able to preſerve your whole ſoul and body blameleſs unto the day of Chriſt, and which <hi>will</hi> do it. This clauſe in the text ſeems to refer to the power and efficacy of God's Spirit, with the word, to keep and prepare his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for heaven. But the divine efficiency in this matter is exerted in a way, which is conſiſtent with the agency of the creature in the ſame thing. This is an idea of importance to be kept in view, that the divine ſovereignty, and creature agency, (with the neceſſity of means in order to ends,) are perfectly conſiſtent. If God work in his people to <hi>will,</hi> and to <hi>do,</hi> of his own good pleaſure, it is that they may work out their own ſalvation with fear and trembling. Therefore, the clauſe of the text under conſideration, implies their own vigorous activity in being built up. According to Jude, ver. 20, 21. "<hi>But ye, beloved, building up yourſelves in your moſt holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghoſt, keep yourſelves in the love of God.</hi>" And many are the divine precepts, which demand the ſame; ſuch as, "<hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate;" "The kingdom of heaven ſuffereth violence, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent take it by force.</hi>" It implies their perſevering in religion. "<hi>He that endureth to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved.</hi>" It implies their growth in grace. "<hi>The path of the juſt is as the ſhining light, which ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day.</hi>" The water of grace not only abides in them a well of water, but is <hi>ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up</hi> unto everlaſting life. It implies their benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent cultivation of harmony among themſelves. "<hi>My dove, my undefiled is one." "That they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee; that they may be one with us.</hi>" It implies their faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to ſupport, and to improve the ordinances
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038515_0009_10124820AB0BE1D8"/>
of the Goſpel. "<hi>Walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameleſs." "Watching daily at my gates, and waiting at the poſts of my doors.</hi>" It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies their remaining ſteadfaſt in the faith. "<hi>Rooted and grounded in the truth." "Not carried about with every wind of doctrine by the ſlight of men, and their cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning craftineſs, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</hi>" It accordingly implies their taking heed, and being aware of falſe teachers; marking and avoiding thoſe who make diviſions contrary to the doctrines of grace. Paul in our context had been warning the Epheſians againſt ſuch impoſtors; and then commends them to God, in hopes of their being built up, as in the text. This circumſtance forms an <hi>antitheſis</hi> between their being ſeduced by impoſtors; and their being built up. The latter, therefore, implies their with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſuch characters. And Paul was ſenſible, not only that God was able to build up his choſen, but that he had engaged to do it; that Chriſt's ſheep ſhall hear his voice, and follow him; that he will give unto them eternal life; that they ſhall never periſh; neither ſhall any pluck them out of his hands; that a ſtranger they will not follow; for they know not the voice of a ſtranger. Thus <hi>grace</hi> is compriſed in the encouragement in the text. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Glory in heaven</hi> is alſo compriſed. "<hi>And to give you an inheritance, among all them, who are ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." i. e.</hi> An inheritance in heaven, among the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral aſſembly and church of the firſt born; among the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect. This is the bleſſed reſult of their being built up; of their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing and perſevering in religion. This is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for all, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation. This inheritance of the ſaints in light, compriſes the moſt glorious excellencies; which are, entire free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from ſelfiſhneſs and ſin; perfect conformity to God; being made perfect in pure and holy love;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038515_0010_10124858B9139280"/>
holy and uninterrupted preſence of God, and of the Lamb; and the bleſſed and holy ſociety of angels, and of the ſaints. It contains nothing pleaſing to carnal hearts; for it is a holy and benevolent happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It affords to holy ſouls a perfect ſatisfaction in God's likeneſs; in beholding his glory ſhining in the face of Jeſus Chriſt; and reflected from all his works. It is a glorious and eternal reſt from all the labors and trials of time and ſenſe; and a free and uninterrupted participation of the river of God's pleaſures. And it probably will compriſe an endleſs progreſſion in knowledge; in ſtrength of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and conſequently in happineſs. This is but an hint of the inheritance in the text. This was the prize, which Paul had in view; this the crown of glory, which animated him in all his perils and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and which he deſired that others likewiſe ſhould ſee and ſecure. This world, he viewed as nothing compared with it. To obtain this prize, he forgot the things, which were behind; reached to them, which were before; and preſſed through all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring difficulties. And, at the affecting moment of parting from chriſtian friends, he could think of noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more comforting, than to commend them to God, and to the word of his grace, confiding in God's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and faithfulneſs to meeten them <hi>for,</hi> and finally confer upon them <hi>this bleſſed inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now attend to ſome</p>
            <div type="improvement">
               <head>IMPROVEMENT.</head>
               <p>AND now, my friends, how far may I be permitted to adopt the words of Paul, in our text and context? You will excuſe me, if I deviate from my uſual meth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of improvements; and attend to the ideas, which preſent circumſtances naturally ſuggeſt. God, in his holy Providence, has afforded me opportunity to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor in the Goſpel, in this place, for a number of years. But now it appears that I have no further call to remain among you. The cauſe of this ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038515_0011_10124823306C2DE0"/>
is well known. And the day is coming, when it will appear, whether there be any thing criminal in the conduct of thoſe, who have occaſioned it in withholding my ſupport. My judgment concurs with the reſult of the Rev. Council, that the intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Providence, relative to my temporal ſupport here, call me to leave this place. Here I ſhall leave this part of the ſubject, after one remark, viz. that I have no hard thoughts of my friends, in this place, for not making greater exertions for my ſupport and continuance among them. I apprehend their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were as great, and as perſevering, as duty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. The Lord graciouſly reward them, in crowning ſimilar exertions with better ſucceſs in ſome other, and better Paſtor!</p>
               <p>As to my faithfulneſs among you, I have nothing of which to boaſt. My conſcience, however, teſtifies that I have ſought your beſt intereſt; and have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to declare to you all the counſel of God; that I have ſet before you the way of life, and the way of death, as exhibited in God's word; and alſo the motives there furniſhed to induce you to purſue the one, and avoid the other. But with many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections I have, doubtleſs, been attended. I pray God to forgive them; and requeſt you to draw over them the veil of candor.</p>
               <p>So far as I have explained to you the Sacred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and ſet before you the truths of heaven, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you that (from a ſacred regard to the authority and the grace of Jehovah, and from a regard to your own immortal intereſt,) you ſolemnly attend to them. Forget not that we are probationers for eternity; that we are here, but for a few days, to cultivate a temper, and form a character, according to which we muſt receive our eternal deſtiny. You have heard, in the former part of this day, how <hi>every one of us ſhall give an account of himſelf to God;</hi> and, among other things, I of my miniſtry among you; and you how you have improved it. And God only knows
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038515_0012_1012485AAFF23350"/>
whether we ſhall ever meet again, till that eventful period.</p>
               <p>And now, ſeeing we muſt part, I leave with you my beſt wiſhes for your happineſs; my cordial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires for your ſalvation. But <hi>what you muſt be,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obtain ſalvation, you have often been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; nor will one ſoul obtain it without this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But what will be your proſpects without the Goſpel? Paul, in our text, commends his brethen to God, <hi>and to the word of his grace.</hi> He left them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the full enjoyment of the ordinances of grace. Happy, indeed, could I leave you, (ſeeing I muſt leave you,) in the enjoyment of theſe privileges! A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, here lies the difference! You are become deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of them. What ſhall I ſay to you concerning this?</p>
               <p>My Fellow Mortals of this vicinity, Is the Goſpel of the grace of God nothing to you? Is it nothing to enjoy it? Nothing to be deprived of it? And noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deſpiſe and reject it? If you remain deſtitute of the Goſpel, mark my words, this place will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come notorious for impiety and wickedneſs. Then what will become of your children, and the riſing generation here? How ſhall you be able to meet their ſouls at the bar of God? And what will become of your own immortal intereſt? O, if you have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for the good of ſociety; and eſpecially for the good of your ſouls, and thoſe of your children, then be entreated ſpeedily to unite with the Church in this place to obtain and ſupport a miniſter of Chriſt. Depend on it, it is your duty, and your weighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. The goſpel miniſtry is the inſtitution of heaven. It is the mean of ſalvation. And, if reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, your ſalvation is loſt! O intereſting thought! Can you, without trembling, read the language of Chriſt to his ambaſſadors, <hi>He, who receiveth you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth me; but he, who deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me; and he, who deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him, who ſent me?</hi> If any of you be found among thoſe, who reject this
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038515_0013_101248259ED82228"/>
gracious inſtitution of heaven, what have you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect? Will Chriſt wink at your impiety; diſpenſe with his ſolemn inſtitutions; and ſtate <hi>other</hi> and <hi>low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> terms, with which you may be pleaſed to comply? Let reaſon judge. If you mean to conduct with any degree of wiſdom, then ſpeedily obtain and improve the privileges of the Goſpel. Appropriate ſo much of your intereſt, as is neceſſary for this purpoſe; and deprive not your ſouls of all the bleſſings of the Goſpel only to ſave a pittance of worldly gain. You will now view me as diſintereſted upon this part of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and will, therefore, permit me to uſe plainneſs of ſpeech. Can a handful of that, which the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtyles <hi>filthy lucre,</hi> do that for you, which the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the grace of God can do? Can the trifling ſum, which you may ſave in refuſing to ſupport the Goſpel, procure you a ſafe retreat at death? Can it open for you the gates of bliſs beyond the grave? Or ſecure you a glorious immortality when the earth is diſſolving in flames? How much can it do for you in ſickneſs; in death; in the judgment day; and in hell? Will riches profit you in the day of wrath? Will it not be a miſerable ſaving, to ſave the coſt of a preached goſpel, at the expenſe of your ſouls, of heaven, and of enduring eternal burnings? Say not theſe inquiries are harſh. They are ſuggeſted by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious truths.</p>
               <p>Conſider on whom you are dependent for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral intereſt; whether God cannot beſtow liberally upon you, if you improve it for him; whether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of the ingratitude and impiety of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a trifle of intereſt to all the bleſſings procured by Chriſt; yea, whether robbing God in tithes and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings be the ſafeſt way to ſecure the bounties of Providence. At your leiſure pleaſe to turn to Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai, i.4—11. and to Malachi, iii.8, 9, 10, where you will find ſomething to the purpoſe upon this idea. Then read Paul's writings upon the ſubject, in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of his Epiſtles; particularly 1 Cor. ix.1—14.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038515_0014_1012485D5F7C12E8"/>
Gal. vi.6, 7, and 1 Tim. v.17, 18. In theſe ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures you may learn your duty as to the ſupport of the Goſpel; and may learn alſo the curſe of God, which lies on thoſe, who rob him in this reſpect.</p>
               <p>And with reſpect to the character of your miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whom you may chooſe; will you prefer a man, who will ſeek, not your ſouls, but to obtain your tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral intereſt? And who will ſeek honor from men in the neglect of faithfulneſs? Will you chooſe one, who will daub with untempered mortar; heal wounds ſlightly; and cry peace, where God ſays there is no peace? Are not our natural hearts full ready enough to deceive us, without the fatal aſſiſtance of ſmooth preaching? Alas, how many among men have their hearts depicted in the following inſpired hint; "<hi>Who ſay to their ſeers, ſee not, and to their prophets, propheſy not unto us right things; ſpeak unto us ſmooth things, propheſy deceit. Cauſe the Holy one of Iſrael to ceaſe from before us.</hi>" The falſe prophets in Iſrael of old were very popular; for their ſmooth preaching ſoothed and pleaſed the carnal heart. But the true prophets were, for their fathfulneſs, hated and put to death. "<hi>I hate him,</hi>" ſays Ahab of Micaiah, "<hi>for he never propheſieth good of me, but evil.</hi>" Chriſt ſays, "<hi>The world hateth me, becauſe I teſtify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</hi>" And the truth of this they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated in putting him to death. How many viewed Paul as an enemy becauſe he told them the truth? And how many thouſands, upon this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, have been put to death? But can it be your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or for your intereſt, to have the ſolemn truths of heaven ſuppreſſed, becauſe the view of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords pain? How long will the pain, in this way, be deferred? Will it not ere long, fall, with an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold weight, upon you? Can any wiſh to be confirmed in fatal deception? Will not ſmooth and falſe teachers ingulf themſelves and their votaries in ruin? Let Chriſt decide it. "<hi>If the blind lead the blind, both ſhall fall into the ditch.</hi>" Which ſurgeon
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038515_0015_101248277493C338"/>
would you prefer? the one, who ſoftly heals the ſurface of your wound, and careleſsly leaves your life in imminent danger? Or the one who benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently performs the painful operation of probing it to the bottom, and ſaves your life, by effecting a thorough cure? Alas, "<hi>The children of this world are wiſer in their generation, than the children of light.</hi>"</p>
               <p>But, know that you are faithfully warned! I muſt rid myſelf of the blood of your ſouls. Permit me, now to remind you, perhaps for the laſt time, that unleſs you do, with humble and penitent hearts, commend yourſelves to God, and to the word of his grace, by prizing and improving the Goſpel; you will fail of heaven; you will be found, at laſt, on the left hand; you will be treated as Goſpel deſpiſers; and will ſink in endleſs woe. With this warning I muſt bid you adieu.</p>
               <p>My young Friends, who are in the morning of your days; What ſhall I addreſs to you, on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion? Will you not lay to heart the things, which have been ſuggeſted, and which you have often heard? If parents, and thoſe, who are advanced in age, in too may inſtances, neglect them, yet will not you attend to them, and ſet better examples? I did expect to ſpend my days with you. But Providence forbids; and I muſt ſubmit. I have eſteemed you as an important claſs of people. I think I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and ſought your beſt intereſt. And I ſtill wiſh your temporal, but eſpecially your eternal proſperity. But permit me, once more, as your friend, to remind you, that you are environed with ſnares, which ruin thouſands. Your danger, while out of Chriſt, is great beyond deſcription. And, probably, it is not leſſened by your preſent proſpects with reſpect to the Goſpel. God grant that you may eſcape the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which attend you, and ſpeedily ſecure a bleſſed immortality. In order to this, be ſober minded. Remember your Creator in the days of your youth. Cultivate true piety. Follow not the multitude to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038515_0016_10124860967D9568"/>
do evil. Dare to break out from the faſcinating charms of popular vice; and to be ſingular for Chriſt. Do not go down to endleſs miſey for the ſake of the multitude, who are goin<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ths of religion, of virtue and peace. Before the faſcinating cup of pleaſures reaches your lip, <hi>pauſe</hi>; conſider who beholds you; what he demands; and what conſequences will follow. And may you be wiſe to avoid the evil, and to chooſe the good. My labors with you will not prove ſo indifferent a matter, as ſome may have viewed them. If I have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, the conſequence muſt fall with dreadful weight upon my own head; but if faithful, as I hope, in ſome good degree, you will find my adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here, (to your joy, or horror,) a ſavor of <hi>life,</hi> or of <hi>death.</hi> God grant it may be the former; and that, though we muſt now part, and I muſt bid you adieu, we may be prepared for an happy meeting in a better world.</p>
               <p>And, now, my Brethren, and Beloved of the Church; it is devolved upon me to addreſs to you my Farewell. — Is this poſſible? Is it a reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Or, is it not a dream? We cannot wake, and find it to be the latter. It is the former. Painful is the ſcene, the diſſolution of the intereſting relation between us!</p>
               <p>What can I now ſay, but in the words of our text, to commend you to God, and to the word of his grace? For he is able, under all your diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to build you up, and to give you an inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance among all them, who are ſanctified. I hope you are intereſted in that celeſtial treaſure. God has afforded us opportunity to form and cultivate an endearing acquaintance with each other; to walk, hand in hand, for a courſe of years, even ever ſince you have been a church. We have mutually waded through ſcenes of trials. And we have been favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many privileges and occaſions of joy. And,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038515_0017_101248298F3520A0"/>
though we muſt now part, I truſt we have a mutual friendſhip formed, which time will never diſſolve; which death will not obliterate; and which eternity will ſtrengthen and refine. If our friendſhip be built on the love of God, this is indeed the caſe. And then, though we muſt be parted in this vale of tears; and God only knows through what trials we may be called to paſs in our different ways; yet one thing we may know, for our mutual conſolation, that "<hi>Neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, our Lord.</hi>" We ſhall then meet in that better world, where there will be no more painful ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; where the wicked ſhall ceaſe from troubling; where the weary ſhall be at reſt in pure and holy love, in the likeneſs and bleſſed preſence of our Savior and Lord.</p>
               <p>O, let us keep that bleſſed world in view. Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not, my brethren, from the path, which leads to it. Be not loſt in this dangerous, intervening wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. Turn not aſide to the right hand, nor to the left, leſt your feet ſtumble upon the dark moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and your ſouls be utterly loſt.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the means of grace, obtain the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of them, if poſſible. Pray to the Lord of the harveſt for this bleſſing. But remember, that an unfaithful ſhepherd, (poſſeſs he ever ſo popular talents,) is, <hi>by far,</hi> worſe than none. Take heed, then, and beware of falſe prophets. Your ſituation, will be critical. I fear that ſectaries and evil work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will be in among you. Errors and damnable her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſies are becoming prevalent and popular; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are their ſubtil advocates, who, if it were poſſible, would deceive the very elect. Take heed, then, <hi>how</hi> and <hi>whom</hi> ye hear. Receive not ſchiſmatics into your houſes. "<hi>Go ye not after them.</hi>" Bid them not God's ſpeed. But mark and avoid them. And
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038515_0018_101248634D8FDCE0"/>
let us watch and pray always, that we may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy to eſcape all the evils, which are coming upon the earth, and to ſtand before the Son of Man.</p>
               <p>I hope you are <hi>rooted</hi> and <hi>grounded</hi> in the truth. God forbid that I ſhould flatter you. But I cannot but feel comforted in the apprehenſion that this is the caſe with you, as a church. May the merciful Savior afford you abundance of grace, that you may <hi>feel,</hi> and exhibit much evidence that this is the fact. In order for this, be blameleſs and harmleſs, the ſons of God without rebuke, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe nation; among whom, ſee to it, that ye ſhine, as lights in the world. Have your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation honeſt among your fellow men; that, if any ſpeak evil of you, they may be aſhamed when they behold your good converſation of Chriſt. Be ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, and immoveable; always abounding in the work of the Lord. If it be poſſible, as much as in you li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, live peaceably with all men. At the ſame time remember to contend earneſtly for the faith once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the ſaints. By no means ſacrifice your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to carnal peace, or to complaiſance; for the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which is from above, is <hi>firſt pure,</hi> then peaceable.</p>
               <p>Should the cauſe of Chriſt be ever ſo much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, or deſpiſed, yet favor not this impiety. Be not aſhamed of Chriſt. Remember Chriſt's moving interrogation to his diſciples, when numbers return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back, to walk 'no more with him, "<hi>Will you alſo go away?</hi>" With melting hearts unite with them in the reply, "<hi>Lord, whither ſhall we go, but unto thee?</hi>"</p>
               <p>"<hi>Let brotherly love continue.</hi>" Let brotherly watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs abound. Remember your vows, and the laws of Chriſt concerning diſcipline. Exhort one another daily, leſt any be hardened through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of ſin. Look diligently, leſt roots of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, ſpringing up, trouble and defile you. And, O, remember to ſanctify the ſabbath! I fear this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will be awfully neglected in this place. If you
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038515_0019_1012482E5EC20600"/>
have no preaching, I beſeech you forſake not the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling of yourſelves together. You have the promiſe of Chriſt's preſence, if but two or three meet in his name. Labor, by word, and example, to prevent all profanation of the Lord's day.</p>
               <p>And, will you not recollect, and comply with this requeſt in the words of Paul. "<hi>Brethren, pray for us.</hi>" Pray for a poor earthen veſſel, who is entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a commiſſion, "<hi>to teſtify the goſpel of the grace of God.</hi>" Pray for him, who has been your Paſtor. <hi>He needs your prayers!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, finally, brethren, farewell; be perfect; be of good comfort; be of one mind; live in love and peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>SOME</hi> may inquire, how Mr. Smith came to be diſmiſſed from his People; ſeeing ſuch a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diality ſubſiſted between him and his Church? The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, merely for want of ſupport. The Church, and thoſe other perſons, who were diſpoſed to join with them, for the purpoſe of ſettling him, were unable to afford him a comfortable maintenance. Thoſe who firſt engaged to pay his ſalary, were but a private ſociety, their number very ſmall, and the ſum propoſed for his ſupport very ſmall. Mr. Smith, nevertheleſs, was adviſed by the Council, to accept the invitation to ſettle; from a conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration, that no objection appeared againſt his ſo doing, which would not lie, with equal force, againſt their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel ſettled at all. After ſeveral years, there was a deficiency in the payment of the ſalary, ſmall as it was, by reaſon, that a number of thoſe who firſt engaged, refuſed to pay their proportion. The difficulty was ſoon increaſed; by the refuſal of ſome others, who were not pleaſed with the place of worſhip; till at length, the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſociety became ſuch, that it was judged expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to diſcontinue their uſual practice, of making an aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the collection of the ſalary. He then (having continued hitherto with much difficulty,) propoſed to call a Council, for advice relative to the expediency of his contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing among them. The reſult of which was, that, although a perfect harmony ſubſiſted between Mr. Smith and his Church; and although they had made great and laudable exertions for his ſupport and continuance among them; yet, inaſmuch as no permanent foundation was laid for his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and ſo many important openings and calls for Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters appeared, theſe diſpenſations of Providence, in the opinion of the Council, evidently called Mr. Smith from this part of the vineyard.</p>

               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:038515_0021_10124865DDC2E968"/>After ſeveral weeks' conſideration, Mr. Smith and the Church unanimouſly viewed it to be their duty to comply with the reſult of Council; which compliance diſſolved their connection.</p>
            <p>The Church, then, unanimouſly voted to preſent the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Addreſs to Mr. Smith; which was delivered at the cloſe of the Public Exerciſes, on the ſame day on which the foregoing Sermon was delivered; and is here annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at the requeſt of a number of reſpectable characters.</p>

            <head>AN ADDRESS TO THE Rev. ETHAN SMITH.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>REV. AND DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT having pleaſed the All Wiſe Diſpoſer of human events, in the courſe of his providence, ſo to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the circumſtances of your Miniſtry and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs relative to your ſupport, amongſt this people, as evidently to point out the expediency of a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between you and this Church, and your paſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al relation to this flock, being conſequently diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by mutual conſent, you will permit the Church, in this public manner, to addreſs you on the affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject. Painful indeed, Sir, to us, is the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that has lately taken place; and it is with the deepeſt regret, that we now view ourſelves deprived of the benefit of your faithful adminiſtrations. But, conſoling thought! we believe that we ſhall ever have an intereſt in your prayers; and, although you and the members of this Church may probably very ſoon be ſeparated in perſon; yet we truſt, that we ſhall not be ſo in affection; but that the fraternal love and chriſtian affection, which has ſubſiſted ever ſince your firſt coming among us, and has been grad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually increaſing through a term of almoſt nine years, will never ceaſe; but be perfected in the realms of love. We hope, and believe, Sir, that nothing ſhort of a full conviction of duty, in the minds both of the Paſtor and Church, has, or could have, finally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to an unanimous compliance with the reſult of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:038515_0023_1012486815323D30"/>
Council; but ſuch a conviction, we are ſenſible, ought ever to produce a quiet ſubmiſſion to the will of Providence; and, however weighty the croſs may be, it is no argument againſt our cheerfully taking it up and following our Divine Leader. We truſt, dear Sir, that we are not altogether inſenſible to the many advantages, which this Church has reaped from your reſidence and labors among us; and we would acknowledge, with gratitude, the obligations which you (under God) have thereby conferred on us. With this view, Sir, permit us to take a retroſpect of paſt ſcenes. And in the firſt place, your active and unwearied exertions, at the time of your firſt entering in to us, in a time of general awakening in this place, more particularly, your readineſs and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduity in inſtructing the ignorant, alarming the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, guiding inquirers, eſtabliſhing the doubtful and comforting the feeble minded; in connection with that eaſy, unaffected and accommodating addreſs, ſo peculiarly your own; your generous ſacrifice of an overture, in a diſtant place, larger than could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from our ſmall number; and your taking the charge of this flock, in the face of a powerful oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, evidence a love and attachment, on your part, which we would gratefully notice. Since your ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, your plain, powerful, and demonſtrative ſtrain of preaching, your fervent prayers, your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic and moving addreſſes, at the celebration of the Lord's Supper; your readineſs, at all times, to viſit the ſick among your people, and to attend on lectures and conferences, whenever requeſted, thus being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in preaching the word, in ſeaſon and out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; your wiſdom and faithfulneſs when preſiding in the Church, and leading them in meaſures deſigned and calculated to promote Goſpel order and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; together with your bold and faithful reproofs; theſe are ſome of the moſt prominent features in your miniſterial character, are gifts by which we have been greatly edified, in the courſe of your miniſtry, and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:038515_0024_101248352358DBD0"/>
the unanimity and love of diſcipline, ſo obſervable in this Church, we eſteem as ſome of the happy fruits thereof. Furthermore, Sir, we feel ourſelves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, in a view of the patience and fortitude, with which you have ſuſtained your peculiar trials and embarraſſments; your deportment having been ſo exemplary, through the whole courſe of your min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry, that not the leaſt impeachment of your mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conduct has been attempted, by any, the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate of your enemies. Theſe things we ought to reflect upon, with pleaſure and joy, being unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thankful, that we have had ſo abundant occaſion (though for a much ſhorter ſeaſon than we hoped) to rejoice in your light. We aſſure you, dear Sir, that whenever you leave us, you have our fervent prayers, for yourſelf, your conſort and family; that an effectual door may be opened, in Providence, for your ſtated and ſucceſsful labors and honorable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in the vineyard of the Lord; where you may prove a happy inſtrument, in the hand of God's Spirit, of turning many to righteouſneſs; and (as your glory and reward) that you may ſhine, as a ſtar of the firſt magnitude, forever and ever. Finally, Sir, we aſk your prayers for this Church and people, in their bereaved ſituation; that we may have grace given us, ſeriouſly to inquire into the grounds of God's controverſy with us; that we may remember how and what we have heard from you, hold faſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, be humbled, and do our firſt works; and when God ſhall have anſwered the gracious deſigns of this chaſtiſement, with reſpect to us, that he will ſend us another Paſtor, after his own heart; under whoſe miniſtrations, may we be trained up for the kingdom of glory; and at length, meet you, our beloved Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, therein, never more to be ſeparated.</p>
            <p>Voted unanimouſly by the Church.</p>
