            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a moment's reflection, he was forcibly ſtrack with the aſtoniſhing coincidence between the principal circumſtances and events of their lives. More of theſe might have been pointed out, but that would have extended the diſcourſe to an unuſual ſize.—It will perhaps, be objected, that any thing like a parallel between an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Prophet of the Lord,</hi> who was aſſiſted, in the execution of his commiſſion, by an extraordinary ſeries of miracles, and a <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The correſpondence between the occaſion which detained the Iſraelites, thirty days in the plains of Moab, and that which has aſſembled us here this day, is ſingularly ſtriking. They had to lament their deliverer, their leader, and their law-giver. And how aſtoniſhingly were all theſe characters united in the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y our grateful tribute of reſpect!</p>
            <p>Let us, only for a moment, advert to the principal circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of their lives, and the great events of their conduct.— When Moſes was tending his flock upon Mount Horeb, he was called by God, to reſcue his nation from the rigor of Egyptian bondage. An encroachment upon the rights of his country called Waſhington from his farm on the banks of the Potomac. It is true, the latter did not, like the former, hear the voice of God, but when he was appointed to command the American army, the moſt hardy ſceptic will ſcarcely dare to doubt, that, in this appointment, Congreſs was directed by the finger of God. If ever there was a time, when the minds of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable body of man were totally diveſted of every paſſion— every intereſted view, or ambitious project, and actuated ſolely by the love of their country, it was at this momentous period. The gallantry, and profound military ſkill, which he diſplayed, in reſcuing the remains of the vanquiſhed army of Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ddock from the unrelenting arms of a ſavage foe, fixed every eye upon Waſhington, as the fitteſt character to conduct the armies of America.</p>
            <p>And here again, we have a wonderful coincidence between the manner in which the Deliverer of Iſrael and of America accepted their commiſſions. Moſes, although he received his appointment from the Supreme Ruler of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, yet his mind was ſo impreſſed with the weight of the unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>g, that he would fain have ſhrunk from the taſk. When the unanimous voice of his country called Waſhington to command, his ſoul, great as it was, labored under the preſſure of ſo vaſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> deſign, and had not a ruling maxim of his life, ſilenced both hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037716_0007_100EF2665A051648"/>
man to be always ready, to exert all his powers, and to riſk his life and fortune in his country's cauſe.</p>
            <p>Diffidence is the attribute of a great mind. Men of little ſouls and feeble underſtandings, who are eaſily elated by honor or intoxicated by diſtinction, will readily undertake any thing, but accompliſh nothing. Whereas thoſe, who have minds ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious enough to ſee and duly appreciate the difficulties of great undertakings, and who are urged on by no ſiniſter mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, will ſeldom fail to feel ſome reluctance in accepting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant offices. From this embarraſſment Moſes was relieved by the voice of God. And had not Waſhington, from having viewed the cauſe in which he was about to embark in every aſpect, and feeling an entire conviction of its juſtice, and the purity of his own motives, been perſuaded that the Lord would be upon his ſide, his ſoul would have recoiled at the proſpect before him. But indeed, this was a principle which, in every arduous undertaking, uniformly ſupported this pious man.</p>
            <p>Moſes was aſſiſted in the execution of his commiſſion, by the viſible hand of God. If it ſhould be contended, that no miracles were wrought in favor of Waſhington—that his foes were neither infeſted with plagues, nor overwhelmed by the ſea, it will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be denied, that this ſingular perſonage was raiſed up by the Supreme Being to accompliſh ſuch a mighty work, as was far beyond the powers of common men. For let us only follow him through his military career, after he took the command of the American army at Cambridge. To diſcipline this body of men, unaccuſtomed to the ſtrictneſs and order of a military life, and with a high ſenſe of their own importance: collected alſo from all parts of an extenſive continent, and poſſeſſing tempers almoſt as various as the climates from which they came, was nearly as difficult as 'to link the jarring elements in peace.' And all this too, was to be done in the face of a powerful foe.</p>
            <p>The brave and undaunted ſoldier, whom no enemy can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, nor danger ſubdue—the great general who can arrange his army with ſkill, and lead it on with gallantry in the field of battle, are characters, though juſtly held in much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſtimation, far inferior to that of Waſhington. It is not at Trenton, where after contending with the elements, that ſeemed to be at war—where after ſubduing the Delaware, rolling on, terrible with ice, he led on, through froſt and ſnow, his half-naked ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſurpriſed and vanquiſhed the enemy.—It is not on the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037716_0008_100EF2695F963268"/>
plains of Monmouth, where he ſeverely checked and compelled to retire under the cover of night, a powerful foe—Nor is it in Virginia, where his ſkill &amp; valour forced to capitulate, a general high in reputation, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t the head of a brave army, that we ſee our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ero moving in his moſt exalted ſphere. Had not his wiſdom been commenſurate with his valour, he might, in a few months, have ruined the American <hi>cauſe.</hi> Had he been only c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lculated for brilliant exploits in the field, he would have been an unfit perſon for the truſt repoſed in him. But when we behold him with an army, moſt even of the officers of which were unacquainted with the art of war—when we find this army ſometimes almoſt without ammunition, and often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed reduced to little more than a name—when we conſider, that it was many times upon the point of mutining for want of pay, and fit to periſh for want of cloaths—and when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect that this army kept in check a formidable foe, protected an extenſive country, in a great meaſure, from rapine, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſurmounted every obſtacle, it is hardly poſſible for us duly to appreciate the merits of its leader.</p>
            <p>The war in America was of a ſingular nature. The Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans had not only to contend with a nation far famed for war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like atchievements, but under the threats of puniſhment for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and almoſt at the point of the bayonet, they had to form a ſyſtem of government, and to reduce all things to order and method. To preſcribe regulations for an army was a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel taſk to thoſe on whom it devolved, and had they not wiſely liſtened to the modeſt ſuggeſtions, and adopted the judicious plans of Waſhington, all might ſoon have been loſt. His great ſoul was unweariedly employed in this arduous buſineſs. As difficulties increaſed, it expanded, and for ſeven long years, which would have exhauſted the perſeverance, and worn out the reſolution of any but this wonderful man, his mind was inceſſantly engaged. Like a torrent, which when interrupted in its courſe, ſwells above its banks and at laſt overcomes every obſtacle; ſo his powers increaſed, as difficulties thickened or dangers preſſed.</p>
            <p>Let us now view the cloſe of this varied and tumultuous ſcene. The enemy ſubdued, and peace about to return to a land worn out with the horrors of war, Waſhington ſtood at the head of an army, that had expoſed their lives, hazarded their he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lth, and injured their fortunes, in their country's cauſe. And this army
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037716_0009_100EF26B5A505400"/>
was unrewarded, and would have followed on, whitherſoever he might have wiſhed to lead them. Had he poſſeſſed an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring and ambitious ſpirit, he might have ſeized the reins of power, enriched his ſoldiers with the ſpoils of his country, and himſelf become its Ruler or its Tyrant. But more like an angel of peace, he ſoothed their diſcontents—he appeaſed their anger. When he took leave of his officers, the ſcene was intereſting indeed! Thoſe hardy veterans, whom no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my could move, or danger overcome, were melted into tears, when about to part with their beloved Waſhington. And when he reſigned that commiſſion, under which he had raiſed his country to independence and to glory, he was more than illuſtrious. This was a point to which the eyes of the whole world were directed with anxiety, and which will command admiration while the world ſhall remain. Nay, methinks I ſee the ſpirits of the heroes of antiquity hovering around to behold and to wonder at this ſcene!!</p>
            <p>When we view the conduct of many great and popular Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, who have ſubdued countries, and overturned govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments—when we caſt our eyes over the horrid ſcenes of revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions in other lands—when we behold demagogues wading thro' blood and ſlaughter to ſeize upon power, we cannot be thankful enough to the Supreme Diſpoſer of nations, for having raiſed up a Waſhington in this favored country.</p>
            <p>And now he returns to the careſſes of his family, and to the tranquility of private life. But dear as this was to his ſoul, it was not long his portion. His country had more ſervices, that required the able hand of Waſhington. Here I might ſtill mark the ſimilarity between the Law-giver of Iſrael and of America. Moſes had not long reſcued the Iſraelites from Egyptian bondage, until he was called up by God into Mount Sinai, to receive a ſyſtem of laws, both civil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious. It is true, when Waſhington was called from his peaceful abode, no mountain ſmoked—no thunder roared—no voice was heard from heaven. But as civil government is the ordinance of God, thoſe, who are inſtrumental in fixing the form and adminiſtering the offices of government, are to be conſidered, in a high degree, as his agents. A conſtituti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n formed amidſt the diſtraction of war, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037716_0010_100EF26F276D1038"/>
of this vaſt and growing empire. And when a new form of government was propoſed, and finally adopted, the wiſhes of all hearts were fixed upon Waſhington, for the adminiſtration of this government. Faction, furious and intolerant as it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is, was afraid to ſhew its hideous face, where once his name was mentioned.</p>
            <p>He now appears in a new character. His fame, as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, had reſounded from one end of the world to the other; his integrity ſtood far above ſuſpicion; but it remained yet to be tried, how he would appear as a ſtateſman. He began his courſe, under many diſadvantages. There was no beaten track to direct: there were no fixed principles to govern: all things, and indeed all characters were new. Heaven, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, always ſmiles upon the virtuous efforts of pious men. He put this grand machine in motion—he conducted it with a maſterly hand. His policy was founded in juſtice, his plans were formed by wiſdom, and executed with vigor. Having no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037716_0011_100EF26D2FDBB198"/>
that no obligation forbid, he placed it in the pleaſing, and advantageous poſition of neutrality.</p>
            <p>This ſtep having been deliberately taken, the intrigues of faction, foreign or domeſtic, could neither ſurprize him at his poſt, nor force him from his ground. Storms aroſe upon every ſide—tempeſts beat—and thunder roared, yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unmoved as a rock amidſt the conflicting elements. Too wiſe, to relinquiſh precipitately the advantages of peace, yet too brave, to dread the horrors of war, he calmly demanded redreſs for the injuries done to his country; and this redreſs the Britiſh nation was pleaſed to give. War between America and that nation, was what the French had long been laboring to produce. And finding themſelves defeated, they attacked the character of Waſhington—they inſulted our government— they plundered our commerce—they abuſed our citizens—they diſſeminated their diſorganizing and wide-wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ting principles, from north to ſouth, from the ſhores of the Atlantic to the banks of the Miſſiſſippi. They vainly hoped to raiſe a faction powerful enough, to cruſh Waſhington, and with him the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and the ſtrength of America. Amidſt all this, he ſteered a correct and an even courſe, faithful to the principles of an impartial neutrality. The unexampled proſperity, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his meaſures, it might have been ſuppoſed, would have ſilenced oppoſition, and ſhamed faction out of countenance. But as well might the Ethiopian expect to change his ſkin, or the leopard his ſpots.</p>
            <p>Having thus guided the helm of ſtate, thro' many danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rocks and tremendous ſtorms, and pointed the courſe, that it ought to be ſteered; old age advancing apace, he thought himſelf at laſt juſtifiable in retiring to the much deſired quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of private life. Still like the great Patriarch, he calls the whole family of America around him, to receive his parting advice. He points out to them thoſe evils, that would moſt endanger their welfare, and tells them, that to be happy, they muſt be united, virtuous and pious—And thus he ends his political career.</p>
            <p>After viewing his character as a general and ſtateſman, we will now turn to his religion. This I conſider as a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant part of the duty of this day, particularly at ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed a time as the preſent. New principles, and new modes of conduct ſeem, every day, to be intruded upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037716_0012_100EF2719C4E5680"/>
and indeed the religious, as well as the political world ſeems to be agitated from one end to the other. In ſuch a ſtate of things, for America to have poſſeſſed a <hi>Chief Magiſtrate</hi> who adhered to the faith and the practice of chriſtianity, is no leſs a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tter of triumph, than his loſs is a ſubject of regret. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity ſeems to have made as bold attempts upon us, as ever the idolatry of the ſurrounding nations did upon the Jews. And, it is much to be feared, that if we had poſſeſſed no Waſhington and other eminent characters, to ward off its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks, it would have found too eaſy admiſſion. Moſes was only forty days abſent from the Iſraelites, when they made a golden calf. And had Waſhington been withdrawn from us at one peculiar criſis, this houſe might have perhaps been a Temple of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> inſtead of a Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>It was his religion, that gave the finiſhing ſtroke to his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. The bluſtering warrior—the impious ſtateſman, will never find a place in the roll of fame, at the head of which, will ſtand the name of Waſhington. Such was his piety, that, on all occaſions, he conſidered himſelf as an humble inſtrument in the hands of God, to accompliſh the purpoſes of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. There are many here who have read, and ſome perhaps who heard the reflections, which he made, upon the wonderful combination of circumſtances, apparently trivial, which ſaved the American army from deſtruction, by the treachery of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold.

               </gap> to our children—we ought to talk of it when we ſit in our houſes—when we walk by the way—when we lie down, and when we riſe up.' Shall we ever again hear in the land where Waſhington lived, that religion is only calculated for men of weak and puny under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings?—That to attend public worſhip is idle and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or that inſtitutions for religious inſtruction are not among the ſtrongeſt pillars of human ſociety! Men of narrow capacities or corrupted hearts, may not ſee the influence of theſe upon public and private felicity, but Waſhington <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of opinion, that it would require a volume to trace all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections. In private life he was no leſs amiable, than he was illuſtrious in public. On both, his principles operated with uniformity—And when he came to die he had nothing to fear. His life, like a river after paſſing over many a tremendous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice, and through many a winding vale, iſſued, calm and ſmooth, into the ocean of eternity. 'Mark, then, the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.'</p>
            <p>Thus lived, and thus died this great man. His country has much reaſon to be grateful to Heaven for his ſervices, and much reaſon to mourn his loſs. His military fame ſtood like a ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part around it, impregnable to foreign force. His well-tried patriotiſm kept foreign incendiaries at a diſtance, and defeated the machinations of internal faction.— The ſplendor of his virtue eclipſed the feeble lights of the illuminati—they diſappeared before it, like the ſtars at the approach of the ſun. But, alas! he is no more!! Methinks I ſee the <hi>Genius</hi> of America weeping over his tomb, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this melancholy lamentation. Would to God, my Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington had lived, till this ſtormy ſcene had paſſed, and peace again beamed upon the earth! Should war deſtroy my ſons, and waſte my country—ſhould diſcord rend, or infidelity corrupt my citizens, to whom ſhall I reſort!!</p>
            <p>But the influence of the good is not confined to the ſhort period of human life. As he has erected a <hi>Fabric of Liberty,</hi> which nothing but the vices or the folly of his ſuc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eſſors can deſtroy, ſo he has left an example, which, like a lamp ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the arch of Heaven, will afford light to America, for many ages. When the mother, anxious for the future fortunes
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037716_0014_100EF275BA5A27F8"/>
of her darling child, ſhall prefer her daily oriſons to Heaven; the will pray to grant him a portion of the ſame ſpirit that Waſhington poſſeſſed. When the father ſhall apply his care to form the character of his ſon, he will place before him the life of Waſhington. When Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica ſhall want a perſon to command her armies or direct her councils, ſhe will look for one, who comes as near as may be, to the character of Waſhington. Indeed, it would be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly wiſe, on all occaſions, when we elect perſons for any of the important offices of government, to inquire how far they reſemble this luminous example. We ought not to conceive ourſelves, for a moment in ſafety, if we allow vice to raiſe its horrible countenance; or permit ourſelves to be under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of aſpiring, wicked, or impious men. Should we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard the bleſſings which God has been pleaſed to beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us—ſhould we ſport with our deareſt rights—and permit ſome ſacriligious hand to lay hold of the helm of ſtate—ſhould we ſuffer his benign and holy religion to be trampled under foot; and modern infidelity to ſeize upon its temples, 'angry Heaven will ſoon mark us out for ruin, and war overwhelm us in the dream of vice—vice!—it is vice that ſhakes the nerves of every ſtate, freezes its veins, and withers all its powers.'</p>
            <p>Let us cultivate with care, and diligently inſtil into the minds of our children, the amiable virtues of the chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which extend their friendly influence through every branch of public and private life. If the faith of this religion govern the hearts, and its precepts regulate the lives of thoſe, with whom we truſt our national concerns, unanimity will ſoon pervade our councils—wholeſome laws will infuſe health and vigor through the whole body politic—the rancor of party-ſpirit will ſubſide—contentions for power, honor or intereſt will diſappear—every conflicting paſſion will be at peace. 'The wolf will dwell with the lamb; the leopard will lie down with the kid, and the calf, and the young lion and the fatling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a little child ſhall lead them.' The ſunſhine of <hi>union</hi> and of peace will gladden the whole land, 'and the Lord thy God will ſet thee on high, above all nations of the earth. And all theſe bleſſings ſhall come upon thee—Bleſſed ſhalt thou be in the city, and bleſſed ſhalt thou be in the field. Bleſſed ſhall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, the fruit of thy cattle and the flocks of thy ſheep. Bleſſed ſhall be thy
