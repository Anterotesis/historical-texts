            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEMOANING the loſs of friends and benefactors—the loſs of the deliverers and protectors of our nation and land, is both decent in itſelf, and warranted by ſcripture example.</p>
            <p>IT has ever been the practice, time immemorial, whenever a prince, princeſs, or perſons, who had been friends and benefactors to the nation, or ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to which they belonged, were removed by death, for the ſurvivors to conſecrate ſome time to lament, and to put on tokens of mourning. This practice we find obſerved, not only by the heathen world, but alſo by the moſt pious, and godly. For when <hi>Sarah</hi> was dead, whoſe name ſignifies a princeſs, or a high mother, <hi>Abraham came to Hebron to mourn for her.</hi> When Jacob yielded up the ghoſt, the Egyptians had ſuch a ſenſe of their loſs, (and well they might,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037962_0005_10102DC622E4A5D0"/>
for Jacob was the father of him, who had been their ſalvation under God in the time of famine, and an interceſſor with God for them) <hi>they,</hi> I ſay, <hi>made a mourning for him threeſcore and ten days. Joſeph made a mourning for his father ſeven days.</hi> When Aaron was dead, <hi>they mourned for him thirty days, even all the houſe of Iſrael. They wept for Moſes in the plains of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab thirty days.</hi> Though they were on a journey, and a toilſome one too, and had not arrived to their ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled habitation; yet, they thought no time loſt to pay ſome reſpect to thoſe worthies. When David received the tidings of Jonathan's death, who was a valiant and friendly man, he ſays, <hi>I am diſtreſſed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleaſant haſt thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, paſſing the love of women.</hi> When Joſiah, king of Judah, was ſlain, the good prophet <hi>Jeremiah lamented him; and all the ſinging men and ſinging women ſpake of Joſiah in their lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> they felt the ſtroke; they were ſenſible of their great loſs. When our bleſſed Lord came to the grave of Lazarus, <hi>he wept;</hi> a good man had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len; the little flock of Chriſt, then in the world, was deprived <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> praiſes of angels, or of men, to add any thing to him, ſhed tears. <hi>Devout men car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF pious and good men, heathen and ſaint, have lamented the loſs of their friends and benefactors; and even the Lord from heaven! Shall we be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Shall we be backward? Shall we refuſe to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the example of the Lord of heaven and earth, the example of the pious and godly in all ages? Shall we demean ourſelv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Be aſtoniſhed, O ye heavens! at this, and horribly afraid, O earth! God forbid.</hi> Surely, reaſon we have to lament, this day, the loſs of him, who, under God, wrought our deliverance, and eſtabliſhed our peace, in the happy enjoyment of our rights.</p>
            <p>IN purſuing our diſcourſe, we ſhall notice two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. The loſs we ſuſtain.</item>
               <item>II. Such a loſs calls for great lamentation.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. The loſs we ſuſtain.</p>
            <p>IT is not my deſign, nor is it in my power, to give you a particular biographical hiſtory of the man, the loſs of whom, we are requeſted to deplore this day. A number of able men have handed to us ſome things reſpecting his excellent abilities and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; no doubt, but we ſhall have a more full and complete hiſtory of the man. But from what hath been ſaid, and from the experience of many of us, we muſt be convinced, that a great and good man hath fallen. No two characters did ever more coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, than Moſes' and WASHINGTON's. To draw their coincidences in character and fortune, a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy divine of late hath done it, and now in print; therefore, it is needleſs for me, in particular, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineate, or to ſay all that might be ſaid of the man. Yet, however, in order to know in ſome meaſure our loſs, it is neceſſary that we have ſome acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with his excellent abilities and qualifications.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS very few, if any, ever exceeded him in every point. He was favored with as great abilities, and with as good qualifications, as any that have been in the world; the meekneſs of Moſes, the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs and patience of Job, the wiſdom of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037962_0007_10102DCAD9CA5B20"/>
and the reſolution of Nehemiah; all theſe centered in WASHINGTON. <hi>When he was reviled, he reviled not again.</hi> He was patient under fatigue and want, and made but few complaints. He was politic in his plans, and wiſe in the execution of them. He was reſolute in oppoſing the <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> the <hi>Sanballats,</hi> the <hi>Tobiahs,</hi> and <hi>Geſhems</hi> of America, both foreign and domeſtic. He ever had the character of <hi>faithful and true;</hi> an eminent Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, <hi>a man of war from his youth</hi>; yet; not delighting in human blood; but in juſtice and in defending the rights of mankind; a father to his country, and the deliverer of it from <hi>the paw of the lion and the bear,</hi> when as weak as the dove, and as feeble as the lamb; an able and wiſe ſtateſman; the giver of the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican Conſtitution; the eſtabliſher of his country's peace, in the full enjoyment of its rights; a friend to literature, virtue, peace and good order; a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of the goſpel of Chriſt, with a great ſenſe of divine providence, which all his writings abundantly teſtify. He was one, <hi>who feared God, and eſchewed evil; given to hoſpitality;</hi> a lover of all men; never elated in proſperity, nor depreſſed in adverſity; ever rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fly to his country's relief, and that in the moſt diſcouraging hour; ever ſteadfaſt, and immovable as a rock.</p>
            <p>HIS character may be viewed as immaculate. No one, whether at home or abroad, was ever able to tarniſh it. All their calumnies had no more effect, than the magician's rods had with Moſes'. The brightneſs of WASHINGTON was ſuch, they could not look ſteadfaſtly upon him. His <hi>face was like the face of an angels.</hi> His brightneſs would diſpel all the darkneſs brought for his diſadvantage, and cauſe it to flee away. <hi>The gates of hell never could prevail
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037962_0008_10102DCF74DF08C0"/>
againſt him;</hi> but were forced to acknowledge, like the magicians of old, <hi>the finger of God is in this; let the people go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HIS abilities as a General and as a ſtateſman have been acknowledged, both by friends and foes, citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and foreigners. I would take notice of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or two: The late King of Pruſſia ſent him a medal, with this inſcription; "From the <hi>oldeſt</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral in Europe, to the <hi>greateſt</hi> General in the world." The Honorable CHARLES J. FOX, one of the ableſt ſtateſmen in Europe, in the Britiſh Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, ('94) delivered the following encomium upon General WASHINGTON: "Illuſtrious man! de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving honor leſs from the ſplendor of his ſituation, than from the dignity of his mind; before whom all borrowed greatneſs ſinks into inſignificance. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indeed," added Mr. Fox, "help admiring the wiſdom and the fortune of this great man:—not that by the phraſe <hi>fortune,</hi> I mean to derogate from his merit; but notwithſtanding his extraordinary talents and exalted integrity, it muſt be conſidered as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly fortunate, that he ſhould have experienced a lot, which ſo ſeldom falls to the portion of humanity; and have paſſed through ſuch a variety of ſcenes, without ſtain and without reproach. It muſt indeed create aſtoniſhment, that, placed in circumſtances ſo critical, and filling for a ſeries of time a ſtation ſo conſpicuous, his character ſhould never once have been called in queſtion:—that he ſhould in no one inſtance have been accuſed either of improper inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or of mean ſubmiſſion in his tranſactions with foreign nations. It has been reſerved for him to run the race of glory, without experiencing the ſmalleſt interruption to the brilliancy of his career. The breath of cenſure has not dared to impeach the

purity of his conduct; nor the eye of envy to raiſe us malignant glance to the elevation of his virtues. Such has been the tranſcendant merit and the unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alleled fate of this illuſtrious man." Thus he.</p>
            <p>THIS we all muſt atteſt to, who have had a knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of the day of WASHINGTON. His enemies never were ſuffered, nor able to crown him with a crown of thorns, nor to array him in a purple robe, with a mock ſceptre in his hand: No; but, by the grace of God, a diadem of glory, a robe of virtue, and a ſceptre of juſtice and humanity, ever attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. Surely, to be deprived of ſuch a patriot, father and friend, muſt be a loſs great indeed, and ought to excite in each of our breaſts great ſorrow and mourning. Which brings me</p>
            <p n="2">II. Such a loſs calls for great lamentation.</p>
            <p>HERE I ſhall give you the reaſons, why we ſhould lament, when great and good men are removed from us by death.</p>
            <p>WHEN great and good men are taken away from us, ſo much of the holy nature of God, as reſided in them when with us, is now taken from the world. Thoſe precious abilities, thoſe excellent qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, gifts and graces, which they were wont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe for the promotion of the honor and glory of God, the peace and proſperity of the nation, with their prayers, have ceaſed. The nation, where they inhabited, had the profit of their abilities, gifts and graces; but now, no more! except only what is kept in remembrance, or upon record, of their holy and inſtructive words and examples.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:037962_0010_10102DD36269FB78"/>THE loſs of great and good men in a nation; men, who have been patriots, deliverers and protectors of their nation and country, demands great lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>They mourned for Aaron</hi> the high prieſt <hi>thirty days, even all the houſe of Iſrael. They wept for Moſes in the plains of Moab thirty days.</hi> And <hi>devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</hi> And why are ſuch to be lamented? Becauſe, thereby, a gap is made to let in the judgments of God upon the remnant that remains. It is ſaid of Moſes; <hi>Therefore he,</hi> i. e. God, <hi>ſaid, that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, had not Moſes, his choſen, ſtood before him in the breach, leſt he ſhould deſtroy them.</hi> Lot was another ſuch; he ſhielded wicked Sodom from the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God; for God ſays to him, <hi>I cannot do any thing till thou art departed.</hi> When the Lord removes ſuch excellent men, he thereby lays open a way to his vengeance. Hence, the death of great and good men is ominous of heavy judgments at hand. Says the prophet, <hi>The righteous periſheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.</hi> Yet, let us hope better things of our nation. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this is a very great and potent argument for our lamentation, this day, for the loſs of him, who was our father and friend.</p>
            <p>WHEN the fathers and defenders of a nation are removed by death, the beauty of that nation is <hi>fallen;</hi> the nation looks not like itſelf Wicked men are the blemiſhes of a people; but good men, upright men, men of ability and integrity, are the beauty and glory of a nation. How deſolate and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly doth a family appear, when the kind huſband, father and governor is removed. How much more ſo, a commonwealth, when a redeemer, father, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector

               </gap>y and nation, and what are they; but, like a vineyard, whoſe hedge is removed, and ſtone-wall broken down?</p>
            <p>THE death of the fathers and defenders of our nation demands bitter lamentation; becauſe, their virtuous walk, pious and wholeſome words, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are no more; and thus a way, for fraud and deceit, ſin and iniquity, and every evil work, to ſpring forth.</p>
            <p>THE time, in which great and good men die, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates the loſs. The day, in which we live, is a day of dreadful war and trouble in <hi>Europe</hi>; and all means have been proſecuted to involve us in the ſame; and we may feel the ſtorm before it be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blown. Thus, to have our General and defender taken from us, at ſuch a criſis, greatly augments the ſorrow of thoſe, who remain; and, that upon the following accounts: Great and good men are often taken away, when virtue and religion, when the ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it and power of godlineſs, are upon the decline; when the love of many has become cold. Ofttimes they are removed, when virtuous and religious men are very few; when men of integrity and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are hardly to be found; when men are full of intrigue and deceit, watching every opportunity to entrap. But, we hope and truſt, that there are ſome crying with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Help Lord, for the godly man ceaſeth; for the righteous fail from among the children of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT that, which moſt aggravates the loſs, is this; when it comes in a time, wherein the ſucceſſion is in any meaſure hindered. In this caſe, the death
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037962_0012_10102DDB5B2566E0"/>
of our political fathers and defenders, is very pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>LASTLY. The removal of great and good men is a juſt ground for lamentation. For, when we conſider what influence our ſins and iniquities have had upon the judgments of God, our unworthineſs of great and good men, our unthankfulneſs for them, and non-improvement of the ſame, have provoked the Lord to remove them. Thus we ſee upon what reaſons our ſorrows are a debt due to the death of great and good men.</p>

They took no delight in them, when living, and ſecretly rejoice when they are dead.

               <p>HERE is reproof for good men, who are too ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and too apt, ſlightly, to paſs over ſuch awful ſtrokes of God. For this it was, God reproved his ancient people the Jews. <hi>The righteous periſheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, none conſidering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.</hi> Such tremendous ſtrokes of God's providence, certainly call for a greater ſenſe and mourning, than is generally to be found in men.</p>

It is true, they lament; yet, they do not lament it as they ought. They ſay ſuch a worthy has <hi>fallen,</hi> the defender of our country and the eſtabliſher of its peace; but they do not lament as they ought, in prayer to the Lord God; they do not cry as the Pſalmiſt did, <hi>Help, Lord! for the Godly man ceaſeth; help, Lord! the remnant that is left; help, Lord! to repair the breach made by death.</hi> Alas! it is to be feared, that the lamentations of the beſt of men are not as they ſhould be.—<hi>Lam.</hi> We may cry with the prophet of old, <hi>My father, my father, the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iot of Iſrael, and the horſemen thereof!</hi> WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON—the GREAT—the GOOD—IS DEAD!— HE, who erected the chariot of the American Iſrael, and formed the harneſs for the government there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of—is no more!
