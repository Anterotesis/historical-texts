            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO The moſt renowned, moſt formidable, and moſt tremendous KNIGHT, GIANT, and <hi>GRAND CALUMNIATOR-GENERAL,</hi> of the Province of <hi>Quilſylvania,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MOST DREADFUL SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>PERMIT me to approach your IMMENSITY with the <hi>firſt Attempt</hi> of a young Genius, ambitious of diſtinguiſhing himſelf in that moſt noble and moſt honourable of all Arts—the ART OF CALUMNY.</p>
            <p>THE Voice of Mankind would condemn me, were I, on this Occaſion, to ſollicit the Patronage of any other than "You, SIR, the great CALUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIATOR of the Province, whoſe dire Delight was ever in the Carnage of Characters, and who, like ſome GIANT in Romance, ſit viewing, with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Pleaſure, the mangled Limbs of murdered Reputations ſtrow'd all around your Caſtle."</p>
            <p>TO you, Sir, are we indebted for thoſe Volumes of unparallel'd Obloquy and Slander, which have ſo largely contributed to the Happineſs of this flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Province.—Not that you deign'd to write yourſelf (tho' ſo highly capable) but that you gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly promoted Writing in others.</p>
            <p>SPEAKING, Sir, is your <hi>Excellence!</hi> Your Mouth alone can utter more true genuine Detraction in one Hour, than all the <hi>learned</hi> Doctors of the College (aſſiſted by the <hi>decent</hi> Mr. <hi>D-ve</hi> and the <hi>magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous</hi> Mr. <hi>D—n</hi>) can diſcharge from their calumniating Pens in a Fortnight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:010014_0003_0F7B98756D7AB728"/>LET a Man but dare to appear even <hi>in Defence</hi> of the Character of his Friend, his Relation, or himſelf; and, in an Inſtant, you beſmear and cover him with ſuch a thick Slime of Slander, that was it not for that powerful <hi>Menſtruum</hi> called TRUTH, he would ſcarcely ever become ſo cleanſed as to be known again by his former Acquaintance.</p>
            <p>SUCH are the happy Effects of your Voyages to <hi>England</hi> in your youthful, and later Days! For ſuch are the Advantages which have reſulted to you from a cloſe Attendance on the Lectures of thoſe celebrated Miſtreſſes of our Art, the —NAIADS <hi>of</hi> BILLINGSGATE!</p>
            <p>I am fully ſenſible, Sir, that this Performance will, in Point of <hi>pure unadulterated Scurrility,</hi> fall far ſhort of thoſe excellent Pieces which your Patronage has lately been the Means of procuring for the Benefit of Society. Should it, however, be the happy Means of my obtaining your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and Encouragement, I cannot but flatter myſelf that I may, fired with Emulation, hereafter rival the <hi>Sentiment-Dreſſer-General</hi> himſelf!</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Obſervations</hi> on Mr. H—s's <hi>Advertiſement,</hi> tho' highly ſeaſon'd with Scurrility, are yet vaſtly inferior in that Reſpect to the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to Mr. F—n's <hi>Remarks.</hi> For this Reaſon I choſe the former for the Subject of my <hi>firſt Eſſay,</hi> hoping that if I ſhould be ſo lucky as to ſucceed in imitating <hi>That,</hi> I might in Time riſe to an Imitation of the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UNPARDONABLE would it be, Sir, were I to paſs over in Silence the Obligations you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on all <hi>Britiſh</hi> America, in ſo wiſely and bravely <hi>daring</hi> the Miniſtry and Parliament to burthen us
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:010014_0003_0F7B98756D7AB728"/>
with Taxes. The good Effects of this <hi>Policy</hi> are now moſt ſenſibly felt, and muſt ever be held in grateful Remembrance.</p>
            <p>NOR ſhould I forget to mention, how much this Province is peculiarly beholden to you for the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>Clubs, Corruption</hi> and <hi>Perjury</hi> at our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual <hi>Elections;</hi> than which nothing could have been better adapted for the Preſervation of that valuable Part of our Privileges.</p>
            <p>AS well might I omit to acknowledge the Services you have rendered this Country, in promoting the Cultivation of the <hi>fine Arts.</hi> The Public Spirit, and Liberality of the famous Society in England, are no ways comparable to what you have exerted and ſhown on this Account. The Art of <hi>Engraving,</hi> in particular, which was thought to be on its Decline among <hi>Britons,</hi> has, by your <hi>generous Bounty,</hi> and under your <hi>Auſpices,</hi> been lately carried to a Height of Perfection unknown to the moſt able Maſters, antient or modern.</p>
            <p>SUFFER me likewiſe, Sir, to congratulate you and the Public, on your new-form'd Alliance with that SCUNK OF SCURRILITY <hi>D—d J—s D-ve!</hi> From an Union of ſuch <hi>kindred Souls</hi> what Bleſſings may not be expected!</p>
            <p>Our ART muſt flouriſh to its full Extent,</p>
            <p>When <hi>D-ve</hi> ſhall <hi>write</hi> what <hi>Al—n</hi> ſhall <hi>invent!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, Sir, ſuch is your unbounded Benevolence of Soul, that, not contented with beſtowing Favours on <hi>Britiſh</hi> America in general, you have even exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded your Obligations to the declared Enemies of your King and Country!—generouſly ſupplying them in the Time of their Diſtreſs with <hi>Warlike Stores</hi> and <hi>Proviſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:010014_0004_0F7B9875B7B5CF70"/>NOR have you, Sir, been more attentive to that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Goſpel, <hi>Love your Enemies,</hi> than you have to that Obſervation of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, <hi>Charity covers a Multitude of Sins:</hi> For tho' your <hi>Charities</hi> have in Reality bore no Proportion to what many others have performed, (your and their reſpective Eſtates conſidered) yet have you, by your Wiſdom and Skill in <hi>ſpreading</hi> them abroad, ſo <hi>covered</hi> many of your Vices, that they are ſcarcely obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable to any but Perſons of nice Diſcernment and Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration.</p>
            <p>HERE, Sir, were I to tread in the beaten Track of Dedicators, I ſhould mention your great Knowledge in Law, Phyſick and Divinity, the Mathematics, Natural and Experimental Philoſophy, and, above all, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Science of <hi>Politics!</hi> Nor ſhould I fail to expreſs my Hopes that you would ſuffer yourſelf to be prevailed upon to oblige the World with the Publication of ſome of thoſe excellent Treatiſes which your leiſure Hours have produced on thoſe Subjects.</p>

            <p>ALLOW me, Sir, tho' you are generally ſo obligingly condeſcending as to ſave others the Trouble of ſounding your Praiſe, juſt to obſerve, That your Politeneſs is equal with your Wit—Your Merit equal with your Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding —Your Love of Truth equal with your Love of Mr. <hi>Fr—n.</hi>

            <p>As to any other <hi>Motive</hi> I had in writing, I can with Truth aſſure my Reader, that I ſhould not have thought of putting Pen to Paper on this Subject, after peruſing what Mr. <hi>H—</hi> publiſhed in Anſwer to <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Obſervations</hi> on his <hi>Advertiſement,</hi> had I not been ſtimulated thereto by the Appearance of a <hi>Print</hi> publiſhed by the Pr—ry Party a few Days after, with a View of blackening the Reputations of ſome of the moſt valuable Men in the Community.</p>
            <p>When I was credibly informed, that the chief Magiſtrate of <hi>Quilſylvania</hi> was principally inſtrumental in obtaining that extraordinary Production, and that he even gave the Author a conſiderable Sum of Money to enable him to bring his Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance into the World, tho' that very Author was well known to have frequently lampoon'd him and his Adherents, I could not but promiſe myſelf, that ſhould I likewiſe be able to ſucceed in laſhing them ſeverely, he might alſo think it proper to <hi>buy</hi> me over to his Party, and afford me that Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Aſſiſtance which are ſo neceſſary to a young Author of ſlender Fortune.</p>
            <p>When I firſt form'd the Reſolution of attacking the Ch—f and his Party, it was my Purpoſe to endeavour to uſe the Weapons of delicate Satire and Ridicule; but upon conſidering the Nature of the <hi>Bodies</hi> I was about to aſſault, I was ſoon convinced that I might as well attempt to penetrate into the Heart of a Butcher's Block with a Razor.—Beſides, as thoſe incomparable Maſters, whom I have taken for my Pattern; have ſo well ſucceeded by the Uſe of the <hi>Cleaver</hi> alone, it would be very imprudent in me were I to make my firſt Attempt with any other Weapon.</p>

            <p>BEHOLD, a <hi>Jack-Pudding</hi> or <hi>Merry-Andrew</hi> is provided! — He mounts the Stage, properly accoutred in his <hi>Maſk</hi> and <hi>Fool</hi>'s-<hi>Cap;</hi> jumps—dances—capers—jingles his Bells— laughs—grins—and chatters like a Monkey—<hi>when he has climb'd ſo high as to ſhow his naked Poſteriors:</hi> Sometimes we ſee him lolling out his Tongue and making game at the gaping Multitude, and ſometimes doing the like at the very worthy <hi>Doctor</hi> himſelf; who, poor Soul, being buſily employed in diſpenſing the <hi>Papers</hi> and <hi>Pacquets</hi> of <hi>poiſonous Drugs</hi> which he had <hi>got prepared</hi> for the Purpoſe, is not the leaſt ſenſible of the ridiculous Figure he makes.</p>
            <p>WITH your Leave, Gentle Reader, we will open one of theſe <hi>Papers,</hi> examine its Contents, and analyſe the Compoſition.</p>
            <p>WE find then, in the firſt Place, that <q>Mr. H—s, for very ſubſtantial Reaſons, is ſuppoſed <hi>not</hi> to be the Author of his Challenge.</q> What thoſe <hi>ſubſtantial Reaſons</hi> may be, we are, however left to gueſs till we come to the laſt Paragraph, where it is intimated, that he is not <q>capable of writing an Advertiſement.</q> Suppoſe this to be really the Caſe (which, by the Bye, no one the leaſt acquainted with Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> will admit) pray, is it the leſs his Challenge on that Account?

Pr—ry Party? — And, after all, why is Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> to be ſuppoſed <hi>not capable</hi> of writing <hi>an Advertiſement?</hi> Surely it cannot be ſaid that any extraordinary Genius or Abilities are neceſſary for ſuch a Purpoſe, ſince we have, in the very News-paper containing Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> Challenge, an Advertiſement wrote by Meſſrs. <hi>Al—n</hi> and <hi>T—er.</hi> Theſe reſpectable Gentlemen, it ſeems, being about to leave off their Buſineſs of <hi>Boiling</hi> and <hi>Baking,</hi> have advertiſed for Sale the <hi>Pots, Pans,</hi> and other <hi>Utenſils</hi> belonging to their Trade.<note n="†" place="bottom">As it is become ſo faſhionable with the Pr—ry Faction, to eſtimate a Man's <hi>preſent</hi> Fitneſs for public Affairs, by what may have been his <hi>former</hi> Occupation, I would humbly recommend to thoſe Dablers in Politics, the learned Doctors of the C—ge, to aſcertain whether a <hi>Baker</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> is not as likely to make a good Politician as a <hi>Baker</hi> of <hi>Sugar:</hi> And when their Hands are in, I wiſh they would likewiſe ſettle to which the Preference ought to be given in Point of <hi>"Rank"</hi>—Whether to the Man who furniſhes us with a <hi>Neceſſary of Life,</hi> or he that procures us a <hi>Luxury?</hi> The Caſe is indeed intricate, and will require a deal of Conſideration, but I truſt thoſe <hi>Sages</hi> are equal to the Taſk.</note>
            </p>
            <p>IF therefore Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> is really not capable of wording an Advertiſement, and is ambitious of acquiring that very profound Knowledge, he has now the happieſt Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity that could poſſibly have offered.

               </gap> and he will find that he has little more to do than to provide himſelf with a large Quantity of WITHS to tye his Words and Sentences together: The reſt will follow eaſy enough. For Example, <q>TO BE SOLD, the Copper Boilers, Copper Coolers and Pans— <hi>with</hi> a large Number of Moulds and Drips—<hi>with</hi> every other Material ready for carrying on the Buſineſs;—toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>with</hi> the Still-Houſe—<hi>with</hi> the Worms and Tubs— <hi>with</hi> a large Shed,</q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>EVERY Author has his Admirers, and 'tis not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable but there may be, among Meſſrs. <hi>Al—n</hi> and <hi>T—r</hi>'s Readers, ſome who will fancy they ſee great Beauties in

their Performance; nor ſhould it be wondered at, if ſome Academical Haberdaſhers of Nouns and Pronouns, ſhould undertake to convince us, that ſo much Clearneſs and claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Elegance of Style, never before entered into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſo trivial a Nature.</p>
            <p>We are told, among other Things offered by Way of Excuſe for the Author of the <hi>Anſwer</hi> not avowing his Performance, that <q>the ſubſcribing political Papers has not been a common Practice either here or in the Mother Country, nor would it be a convenient One.</q> —What the common Practice in the Mother Country may be, with regard to political Papers, I can ſay nothing of my own Knowledge, as I never was there. But I look upon the Paper in queſtion to be not ſo much a <hi>political</hi> as a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal</hi> Paper: Far the greateſt Part of it conſiſts of <hi>perſonal Reflections</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>F—n.</hi> Now, I am told by thoſe who have reſided in England, that it is very <hi>uncommon</hi> there to attack in Print a Perſon's <hi>private Character</hi> on account of any Difference in Sentiments about <hi>publick Affairs;</hi> and that <hi>Wilkes</hi> and <hi>Churchill</hi> are almoſt the only Dealers in that dirty Buſineſs who have appeared there for many Years. The firſt of theſe we find, has on that Account been outlawed by King, Lords, and Commons; and the ſecond held in Deteſtation by every good Man throughout the King's Dominions. Nor can I find that the Practice was ever introduced into this Country, till the <hi>very Revd.</hi> Dr. <hi>S—h</hi> made his Appearance, and we all know what great <hi>Veneration</hi> and <hi>Eſteem</hi> he has thereby acquired.—It is therefore not to be wondered at, if Perſons of their Stamp ſhould not think it <hi>convenient</hi> to be known to the Publick.</p>
            <p>But <q>the Cauſe of Liberty (we are told) would often be left to ſuffer, if her Advocates were obliged to expoſe their Names to the Clamor of Party or the Reſentment of Power.</q> In ſo glorious a Cauſe as that of <hi>Liberty,</hi> no Man ought to be afraid to ſtand forth. Thoſe who have rendered it the greateſt Services have ever been ſuch

                  <hi>Clamor of Party,</hi>
               </q> or the <hi>"Reſentment of Power,"</hi> ſince, according to his <hi>own Account,</hi>

            <p>IT is ſaid, however, that <q>almoſt all Mr. <hi>F</hi>'s political Pieces have appeared without a Name, ſuch as, his <hi>Preface</hi> to Mr. <hi>G—y</hi>'s Speech, his <hi>Cool Thoughts,</hi> his <hi>Narrative,</hi> his <hi>Hiſtorical Review,</hi> and many more, in which he has taken great Freedom with the Characters of others.</q> But, to have ſhown that Mr. <hi>F—n</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct was ſimilar to our Author's, he ſhould have <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>HIS <hi>Preface</hi> is an anonymous Anſwer to Parſon <hi>Pe—rs</hi>'s, Parſon <hi>S—th</hi>'s, Parſon <hi>Al—on</hi>'s, and Parſon <hi>Ew—n</hi>'s anonymous Preface to what was <hi>called</hi> Mr. <hi>Dic—n</hi>'s Speech. Yet tho' he was greatly reflected upon in their Preface, he has but juſt named the firſt as it were, and of the ſecond all that he has ſaid, which is any Ways per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, is, "<hi>S—h</hi> that <hi>Poiſoner</hi> of other Men's Characters."

Was it not expreſsly wrote to ſpirit up the People to defend the G—r, who was inſulted and threatened, and to ſtrengthen the Powers of Government which were deſpiſed and trampled upon?

            <p>THERE remains then on the Liſt, only, "His <hi>Hiſtorical Review</hi>" as it is called; but as I am well aſſured from good Authority, that he did not compile that Work, and as it is little more than a mete Relation of the publick Conduct of the ſeveral Branches of our Legiſlature, there is nothing farther neceſſary to be ſaid on that Head.—And as to the "many more" of his political Pieces, which our Author has not named, he is defy'd to produce one wherein Mr. <hi>F—n</hi> begun an Attack on any Man's Reputation. If in any <q>he has taken great Freedom with the Characters of others,</q> it is only where he has been drove to it <hi>in his own Defence,</hi> and after he had paſs'd by ſo many villainous Aſperſions of his Character, as to induce his Calumniators to think they might continue to abuſe him with Impunity.</p>
            <p>MR. <hi>F—n</hi>'s Friends are next aſked, <q>Why they will inſiſt upon a Practice ſo different from his own, and even make it a Condition on which alone they will make a <hi>Reply?</hi>
               </q> They do not, as appears from what is already ſaid, inſiſt upon any Practice <hi>different</hi> from his own; all they aſk, and in which every honeſt Man will think them right, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that his Adverſaries will act in the <hi>ſame</hi> open Manner he has done, and ſubſcribe their Names to their Performance.— Even his <hi>anonymous</hi> Pieces were ſo far from being diſown'd by him, that he always, upon being aſk'd, acknowledged he was the Author. But of all the Shoal of anonymous Prop—ry Papers which have appeared during our Conteſts, there cannot be found a Man that will own one of them; on the contrary, the greateſt Care and Pains is taken to conceal the Names of their ſeveral Writers.</p>

But ſurely this is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued to mean that, if they <hi>don't avow</hi> it, there will then be <hi>no</hi> Reply made, either <hi>anonymous</hi> or <hi>otherwiſe.</hi> If you really, Gentlemen, do imagine that this was the Intention of either Mr. <hi>H—s,</hi> or any other of Mr. <hi>F—n</hi>'s Friends, you flatter yourſelves egregiouſly. They were determined, from the firſt, to <q>detect and expoſe what was falſe in the Anſwer to the Remarks,</q> but then they wanted alſo to <hi>detect</hi> and <hi>expoſe</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> of thoſe <hi>Falſities,</hi> and thereby prevent his <hi>impoſing</hi> on the Publick in future; which could not be done without he could be made to appear. For this Purpoſe, and to ſhow his Regard for an abſent Friend, Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> publiſhed his Challenge; but, to do you Juſtice, you have had the Addreſs to diſcover the Plot, and have therefore prudently declined entering the Liſts.</p>
            <p>SINCE Matters are thus circumſtanced, and you are determined, like your Brother Savages of the Ohio, to keep to your <hi>Buſh-Fighting,</hi> we muſt engage you in the <hi>ſame Manner.</hi> A prudent Officer will always adapt his Operations to the <hi>Nature</hi> of his Enemy, and attack them <hi>in their own Way.</hi>— By this Conduct <hi>Boquet</hi> conquered; by the contrary <hi>Braddock</hi> was defeated.</p>
            <p>AS to myſelf, I am but young and inexperienced in waging <hi>Wordy-War,</hi> this being the firſt Campaign I ever ſerved; yet have I Spirit enough to attack the great <hi>Giant</hi> himſelf in his <hi>Caſtle,</hi> notwithſtanding all his <hi>Blunderbuſſes.</hi> But ſhou'd I not ſucceed in my Attempt, there is a hardy Band of Veterans, all ſure Markſmen, and long enured to Service, who intend ſoon to charge their <hi>Rifle-barrel'd Quills,</hi> and make one general Aſſault on the Giant and all his Adherents. A Body of light Infantry, all Volunteers

of undaunted Courage, have already entered into the Service, and have undertaken to ſkirmiſh with the Enemy's Flankers and advanced Guards, and occaſionally attack ſome of their Out-Poſts.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, ſetting aſide the "blundering Simplicity" of our Author, who ſtiles Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> a "<hi>Welſh</hi> Squire," tho' he was born in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> I ſhall proceed to the next Sentence, which is indeed a curious One. It is there ſaid, that Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> 
               <q>by calling for a Gentleman of Character to enter the Liſts with him, is made to pay himſelf the Compliment of being a <hi>Gentleman of Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and to allow Mr. <hi>A—n</hi> to be the ſame, tho' the Author of the <hi>Remarks</hi> had aſſerted the direct contrary.</q> On this I would juſt obſerve, that if Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> did really call Mr. <hi>A—n</hi> a Gentleman of Character, he then certainly might call himſelf ſo, without incurring the Imputation of paying himſelf a Compliment. But as he really did <hi>not</hi> make uſe of that Appellation to Mr. <hi>A—n,</hi> he ſtands totally clear of the Charge. His Words are, <q>if Mr. <hi>A—n,</hi> OR any Gentleman of Character.</q> Here is a very plain Diſtinction made by him, and it is evident he could not intend to compliment Mr. <hi>A—n</hi> with that Title; for, if he had, he would have ſaid, <q>or any <hi>other</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Character, &amp;c.</q> — The Author of the <hi>Remarks</hi> likewiſe ſtands as clear of the Charge of having <q>
                  <hi>aſſerted</hi> that Mr. <hi>A—n</hi> was <hi>not</hi> a Gentleman of Character,</q> for he has <hi>aſſerted</hi> no ſuch Thing. It muſt, however, be allowed, that he pointed out ſome Parts of Mr. <hi>A—n</hi>'s Conduct which prove he has not always acted up to the Character of a Gentleman.</p>
            <p>WE are next told, <q>that the greateſt Part of the Charges in the <hi>Anſwer</hi> are taken from the <hi>Proteſt,</hi> which has been ſigned not only by Mr. <hi>A—n,</hi> but nine other Gentlemen of <hi>undiſputed</hi> Character, and therefore any further Signing would have been unneceſſary.</q> This alſo is a groſs Miſrepreſentation; for ſcarce a Tenth Part of the Charges are taken from the <hi>Proteſt.</hi> A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable

Number of them were not even then <hi>invented.</hi> Thoſe contained in the <hi>Proteſt</hi> were fully refuted by the <hi>Remarks,</hi> not only to the Satisfaction of every Man of Candor, but even of ſome of the <hi>Proteſters</hi> themſelves. However, I ſhall leave that Matter to be properly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the <hi>Reply;</hi> and only juſt remark here, that I cannot ſee with what Propriety, Men, who have publickly aſſerted, what ſome of them knew at the Time to be <hi>abſolutely falſe,</hi> and others of them <hi>knew nothing at all about,</hi> merely to blaſt the Reputation of a Fellow Citizen who never did one of them the leaſt Injury, can be ſaid to be Gentlemen of <hi>undiſputed</hi> Character.</p>

            </q>
            <p>I have, however, ſo much Charity as to believe that ſeveral of the <hi>Proteſters</hi> are now ſo aſhamed of the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Part they have acted, that they would refuſe to do the like again, even tho' directed by Mr. <hi>A—n,</hi> and threaten'd with the Loſs of their Commiſſions. It is but Juſtice too that I ſhould mention my having heard that one of them has declared, "He almoſt wiſhed his Hand had been cut off before he ſign'd the Proteſt, but that he was prevailed upon to do it againſt his Judgment."</p>
            <p>AND when Mr. <hi>A—n</hi> himſelf was interrogated concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reaſon of his Conduct on the Occaſion. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he was hurried into it, having ſcarce Time to read the Paper over; for that he received it while he was at Dinner at <hi>New Caſtle,</hi> with a Letter from Philadelphia, purporting, "That if he did not ſign it firſt none of the reſt would, and that there would likewiſe be Danger of ſome of <hi>their</hi> Country Members not joining them at a future Seſſions, unleſs they could carry down with them ſome ſpecious Reaſons to juſtify their Conduct to their Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010014_0010_0F7B987C40992320"/>
which Purpoſe would be beſt anſwered by publiſhing the ſaid Proteſt with their Names ſubſcribed." But, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily for the Gentleman's Veracity, it has ſince come out, that he did read it over ſeveral Times, ſhow'd it to Mr. <hi>C—w,</hi> and deſired his Opinion of it. Mr. <hi>C—w</hi> read it accordingly, and adviſed Mr. <hi>A—n</hi> in Words to this Effect: "By no Means put your Name to it —it is a vey fooliſh Affair —can be of no Service to our Cauſe —and if you ſign it you may depend that Mr. <hi>F—n</hi> will expoſe you in ſuch a Manner as to make you repent it as long as you live." Sign it, however, he did, and gloried in it till the <hi>Remarks</hi> appeared. When they came out, he was in a terrible Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidation indeed. "Wha-wha-wha-What<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (ſays he to one of his Acquaintance) can make Mr. <hi>F—n</hi> uſe me in this Manner —He-he-he ſeems angry! Bla-bla-bla-Bleſs me, I never dreamt he would have ta-ta-ta-taken it ſo ill, or I ſhould not have ſigned it —I don't know that I ever ſpo-ſpo-ſpoke a diſreſpectful Word of him in my Life —I always thought him a Ma-ma-Man of Integrity and a Ma-ma-Man of Abilities, tho' I did not like his Po-po-po-Politicks."</p>
            <p>HOW very little <hi>diſreſpectful</hi> he has talk'd of Mr. <hi>F—n</hi> let thoſe teſtify who have had the <hi>Honour</hi> of being in his Company at any Time within the laſt ſeven Years. I can call on ſome of them who can vouch, that he has not only ſcandalouſly traduced that Gentleman's Character in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and America, but even meanly attempted to blaſt the Reputation of his <hi>Son,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>himſelf</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in their <hi>Political Sentiments.</hi> Though the Son has neither directly or indirectly interfered in our Diſputes ſince his Return from England, has treated all thoſe of the Pr—ry Party, who have fallen in his Way, with as much Civility as he has done thoſe of the other, yet has this venomous Slanderer continually aſperſed his Character, and even had the <hi>Villainy</hi> to accuſe him of a Tranſaction that every Man in the Government where he reſides <hi>knows to be totally FALSE.</hi> Not contented, however, with thus vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying him in private, he has had the Baſeneſs to employ

thoſe Miſcreants <hi>S—th, Ew-n</hi> and <hi>D-ve,</hi> to give him a Spattering of their <hi>Hog Waſh</hi> in almoſt all their execrable Performances! — But this is not the only Inſtance which can be produced of his carrying his Malice and Reſentment to the Children of thoſe who have occaſionally diſobliged him.</p>
            <p>THAT he who is ſo link'd with the Prop—r, and has had, with his Brother-in-law, the almoſt ſole Diſpoſition of Offices in this Province for a conſiderable Number of Years, ſhould be ſtrenuous in oppoſing a King's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not to be wondered at; nor ſhould we blame him greatly, or any others poſſeſs'd of Offices under the Pro—r, for their Struggle on this Occaſion, provided they behaved decently; and did not, for the Sake of ſucceeding in their Schemes, attack the <hi>good Names</hi> of thoſe who are of a different Opinion with themſelves. This is what no Men, who deſerve good Names, can always have ſuch Command over themſelves as not to reſent; nor can it be thought to be wrong, by him who has any Feelings, if at ſome Time or other they take that Revenge which may be in their Power.</p>
            <p>AS to Mr. <hi>F—n's</hi> POLITICS, which Mr. <hi>A—n</hi> has ſuch an <hi>Averſion</hi> to, let the Meſſages on the Minutes of Aſſembly, and his other political Writings declare. They will there be found to be ſuch as muſt do him Honour with all Lovers of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> as long as <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> are held in any Repute.</p>
            <p>TO proceed, <q>Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> ('tis ſaid) knew he trod on ſafe Ground, by calling on Mr. <hi>A—n</hi> particularly in this Affair, as he well knew that Mr. <hi>A—n</hi> would not chuſe to enter the Liſts with <hi>ſuch</hi> an Antagoniſt as <hi>had</hi> yet appeared.</q> But, pray, Mr. Author, who was the Antagoniſt that Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> knew <hi>had</hi> appeared? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as I conceive your Meaning, I ſhan't differ with you about Words.

            <p>Our Author next tells us, <q>that Mr. <hi>A—n</hi> neither was, nor could be <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> the Author of a Performance in which ſo much is ſaid to his own Advantage, and that his <hi>Modeſty</hi> and <hi>Senſe</hi> would at leaſt have prevented this.</q> But as his poſſeſſing thoſe two Qualities was not a Matter of <hi>publick Notoriety,</hi> the <hi>Suppoſition,</hi> if there was any ſuch, is at leaſt excuſeable: And what makes it the more ſo is, that, among the numerous People to whom he harangued by the Hour, there are but few who will not acknowledge that his own Praiſe was the Subject of a conſiderable Part of his Diſcourſe.

Part," and to have ſent the Piece when publiſhed, to all his Acquaintance abroad, recommending it as a very fine Performance, containing a <hi>juſt</hi> Account of Mr. <hi>F—n</hi>'s Conduct; it was but reaſonable to imagine, that he would be either weak or wicked enough to own himſelf the Author, or at leaſt undertake to juſtify the Contents. This too was the rather to be expected, as he had given us a recent Inſtance of his aſſuming to himſelf even what he had <hi>no hand in;</hi> namely, the <hi>Putting off the Stamp-Duty;</hi> as plainly appears by a Letter from Mr. <hi>Huſke,</hi> Member of Parliament, which was <hi>ſigned with his Name,</hi> and <hi>publiſhed</hi> in all the News-Papers on the Continent except thoſe of <hi>Quilſylvania;</hi> and why it was not publiſh'd there needs not to be explained. So far it ſeems was he from contributing thereto, that it was the <hi>"blundering Simplicity"</hi> of our <hi>Quilſylvanian "Squire,"</hi> which made the Miniſtry more determined in that Matter than they otherwiſe would have been. Such a Man as this had needs be, as our Author ſays, <q>not ſo deſtitute of Friends as to be under a Neceſſity of advocating his own Cauſe:</q> For where a Cauſe requires ſuch a deal of advocating, it would be a cruel <hi>Neceſſity</hi> indeed if one ſo little capable was obliged to perform the Whole.

            <p>WHEN theſe ſame <hi>Friends,</hi> or rather <hi>Creatures,</hi> will accompliſh their <hi>Work</hi> 'tis hard to ſay; for tho' they have been a long while induſtriouſly employed in <hi>whitewaſhing</hi> their Cauſe; yet they think it ſtill ſo <hi>very dirty,</hi> that they are aſham'd to be <hi>known</hi> to have had any hand in the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.— It is, hovever, a little ſurpriſing that notwithſtanding they labour ſo hard for their Employer, he ſhould keep them ſo ſcanty both of Victuals and Money as to oblige them to give him ſuch ſhrewd Hints of their wanting to have a little "Eating in the Caſe" even tho' it were but a few <hi>"Pies</hi> and <hi>Cakes."</hi> But leſt he might ſuſpect they only wanted Money to lay out on <hi>Betty Nic-be-raviſhed,</hi> a

            <p>IT is diverting to hear one of theſe "<hi>poor</hi> Authors" (as they juſtly ſtile themſelves when they ſpeak of their <hi>Authorſhip</hi>) talk of the Danger of being "frighten'd out "of his WITS," and yet diſcover to his Readers that he has not even the <hi>Wit</hi> to know the Difference between leaving a Matter to <hi>Arbitration,</hi> and laying a <hi>Wager.</hi> Alas, poor Devil! <hi>even</hi> your Employer has <hi>Wit</hi> enough to know, and could have informed you, that every Man <hi>in his Wits,</hi> who has any Diſpute with the Prop—rs about Property, chuſes, tho' he may have the Law ever ſo clear of his Side, rather to leave the Matter to <hi>Arbitration,</hi> where he has "<hi>Half a Chance</hi> of a favourable Decree," than run the Riſque of a Deciſion from a <hi>Pr—ry C—f-J—ce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the true Reaſon for this <hi>Jack-Pudding</hi>'s terming Mr. <hi>H—s's</hi> Propoſal a <hi>Wager,</hi> was, I imagine, that he might take that Opportunity of ſneering at and ridiculing his <hi>Maſter,</hi> as he had done before in what he ſaid about his "Modeſty and Senſe." This ſeems plain from his very Words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>I have heard a <hi>noiſy Fellow</hi> in a <hi>Coffee Houſe,</hi> after every other Argument failed, offer <hi>(Reaſon</hi> or <hi>not Reaſon)</hi> to lay <hi>Two</hi> to <hi>One</hi> he was right.</q> Now I appeal to every Frequenter of the Coffee-Houſe, and even to thoſe who ſit in another Houſe, whether our illuſtrious Chief has not been more diſtinguiſh'd for that Practice than any other Perſon they know, and whether the Deſcription above quoted is not ſtrictly applicable in all its Parts to his Worſhip's Honour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:010014_0014_0F7B987EB7D234F8"/>Mr. <hi>H—s</hi>'s Motives for propoſing a <hi>Reference,</hi> were noble, generous, diſintereſted, and ſuch as muſt ever do him Honour, with every Man whoſe good Opinion is valuable. They were to put a Stop to any further Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with Regard to the Character of his abſent Friend, <q>and to prevent the Publick from being any longer impoſed on by falſe Repreſentations.</q> He offered for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to leave the Points in Diſpute to the Deciſion of Gentlemen from any of the neighbouring Provinces, as they might be ſuppoſed the moſt unbiaſſed and impartial. And, that the Publick might receive ſome Benefit in whatever manner the Affair might iſſue, he further offered to pay <hi>Ten Pounds</hi> to the Provincial Hoſpital, for every Fact mentioned in the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Remarks</hi> injurious to Mr. <hi>F—n</hi>'s Character, which ſhould be proved to the Satisfaction of thoſe Gentlemen; provided the oppoſite Party would pay <hi>Five Pounds</hi> for every Falſhood, or groſs Miſrepreſentation their ſaid <hi>Anſwer</hi> ſhould be proved to contain. This was acting openly, like a Man of Honour engaged in a Cauſe which his Conſcience approved: He had no Inclinations to have his Friend's true Character concealed from the World: He deſired, for the Sake of the Publick, that it might undergo a ſtrict Scrutiny, and that if Mr. <hi>F—n</hi> was the wicked Man he had been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, he might be recorded as ſuch. This Propoſal, however, was not accepted: But every Perſon muſt be convinced, that if the Party could have ſupported one Half of the Charges brought againſt Mr. <hi>F—n,</hi> they would not have omitted ſuch an Opportunity of deſtroying his Reputation: For every one, the leaſt converſant with our Affairs, knows that the Ruin of that Gentleman's Character is the grand Point they have in View, as they hope thereby to deſtroy the Confidence ſo long placed in him by the Publick— a Confidence that has ſo greatly contributed to baffle the repeated Attempts to render us Slaves to Pr—ry Will and Pleaſure.— If what they have alledged againſt Mr. <hi>F—n</hi> be <hi>Truths,</hi> they are <hi>Truths of Importance</hi> to this
<pb facs="unknown:010014_0014_0F7B987EB7D234F8"/>
Country, eſpecially at this Criſis; and no Man, if he had really the Good of his Country at Heart, would be aſhamed or afraid to ſupport them publickly. But how ſcandalous is the Part the Pr—ry Faction have acted on the Occaſion! They even make the very <hi>Equity</hi> of the Propoſal a Reaſon for not agreeing to it; <q>for (ſay they) that would be ſecuring Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> HALF A CHANCE of a favourable Decree!</q>— Now can theſe Men expect to be deem'd <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> or as having the leaſt <hi>Tincture of Honour,</hi> who will engage in a Cauſe they think ſo <hi>very bad,</hi> that they cannot truſt it to <hi>impartial</hi> Perſons, becauſe there will then be <hi>half a Chance</hi> that it is not decided in their Favour? Nothing leſs, it ſeems, will ſatisfy them than does their Maſter, the Pr—r, who will not ſubmit any Cauſe of his to Judges here, unleſs he can command the Determination of a Majority.— Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> had not any Objection to refer the Matter to Perſons choſen in <hi>Quilſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi> but he imagined that it would be deemed faireſt to leave it to thoſe who might be ſuppoſed to be entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted, and unbiaſſed by Party. If, however, the <hi>Proteſters</hi> are willing to leave it to Gentlemen of their own Province, mutually choſen, I dare ſay, he has not the leaſt Objection, notwithſtanding they ſay, <q>
                  <hi>Five Sixths</hi> of the People of this Province who have ſeen the Anſwer to the Remarks <hi>ſeem</hi> already to have decided in its Favour.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THAT Word <hi>ſeem</hi> is indeed cautiouſly choſen, but it cannot with Truth be applied to any but P—ry Minions; "five Sixths" of whom, it muſt be confeſſed do <hi>ſeem,</hi> and <hi>only ſeem,</hi> to "decide in its Favour"— becauſe they <hi>dare not do otherwiſe:</hi> But even among them there is not a ſingle Man to be found who thinks ſo favourably of it, as to <hi>ſhow himſelf openly</hi> in its Behalf. As to <hi>other</hi> Readers of the <hi>Anſwer</hi> in this Province, there is not even one in Five hundred but what are ſo far from <hi>ſeeming</hi> to approve, that they <hi>publickly</hi> expreſs their Abhorrence of it and its Authors, and think they ought, if poſſible, to be dragg'd into Light, and expoſed to publick Scorn.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:010014_0015_0F7B987FA126ADD8"/>THOSE Words <hi>"Five Sixths"</hi> may likewiſe ſerve well enough to amuſe the Pr—r who lives at a Diſtance, and make him believe that tho' they did not ſucceed in making a Change in the Aſſembly, (which the Party promiſed him they would, in order to enable him to carry all his Points, and ſave him from the Mortification of doing Juſtice to the People) yet that by their Writings and Influence they had brought over a great Majority of the Inhabitants to their Side. In this Manner they amuſed the G—r when he was at <hi>N-w-C—le,</hi> during the laſt Sitting of Aſſembly. Letters were daily ſent him by Mr. <hi>A—n,</hi> to let him know that Matters went on ſwimmingly in the Houſe, that the Pr—ry Party there was encreaſing apace, and that he had not the leaſt doubt but he ſhould have every Thing managed agreeable to his Wiſhes. [For who could withſtand the Force of ſo much Eloquence!] But alas, when Matters came to be put to the Vote, he found that he was not even able to carry a ſingle Point, or to make a ſingle Convert; but on the contrary, ſome of the very Members whom the Pr—ry Party had got choſen, were aſhamed to appear in ſuch a Cauſe, and therefore joined the other Side. The Figure he made when he appeared before the G—r at <hi>N-w-C—le</hi> with the diſmal News of his ill Succeſs, was even more <hi>woeful</hi> than that of the <hi>Knight of the woeful Figure</hi> himſelf.— In the ſame ridiculous Light muſt he appear to the Pr—rs; for they are not quite ſo devoid of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (whatever he may have reaſon to think of them) as to believe it poſſible that ſo great a Majority of the Houſe would have ventured to have choſen Mr. <hi>F—n</hi> to repreſent the Province in <hi>England,</hi> after ſo much had been ſaid and done to prevent it, if they were not aſſured of its being agreable to a great Majority of their Conſtituents.</p>

The Sentence to which the above Quotation from our Author alludes, is this: <q>But as I am fully perſuaded of the Truth of what he [Mr. <hi>F—n</hi>] aſſerted in the Remarks, <hi>That his Reputation is dearer to him than Life,</hi> I think it would be <hi>as inconſiſtent</hi> with the Eſteem and Friendſhip I have long profeſſed for him, were I to ſee his Character ſo inſidiouſly and infamouſly attacked, without my appearing in his Behalf, <hi>as it would</hi> be for me to obſerve a Ruffian attempting to ſtab him <hi>in the Back,</hi> without my offering to avert the Blow.—</q> "Now it may be curious to obſerve, how" our Author, by alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tranſpoſing, and adding to the Words of the latter Part of this Sentence, without paying any Regard to their Connection with the former Part, has, as he thinks, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed himſelf with an Opportunity of diſplaying an infinite deal of <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Humour.</hi> This indeed is no uncommon Practice with Men of heavy Intellects, who having no genuine Wit of their own, are obliged to <hi>ſtudy</hi> how to be <hi>witty.</hi> Thus have I obſerved ſome of your ſecond Rate Punſters, who not being able to ſtart a Pun off hand on Things as they occur in the Courſe of Converſation (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the beſt is ſcarcely tolerable) do therefore labour hard to force the Diſcourſe to ſuch Subjects as may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010014_0016_0F7B988082551F48"/>
introduce the Puns they had previouſly prepared in their Cloſets. And thus has our Author managed: Having furniſhed himſelf with a Quantity of Stuff which he took to be good ſound <hi>Wit,</hi> and being determined to ſquirt it all at Mr. <hi>H—s</hi>'s Advertiſement, he examines that care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully over in order to find ſome Spot proper for its Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not being able to diſcover any, he falls immediately to work to make one; juſt as ſome <hi>Curs</hi> ſtrive hard to ſcratch a Hole in which they may diſcharge their Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>SO much, by Way of <hi>Simile,</hi> in Complaiſance to our Author, who ſeems very fond of the Buſineſs of <hi>Simile-making;</hi> and 'tis no Wonder that he ſhould; for he has a moſt ſurprizing Skill in adapting them to his Subject. For Inſtance: After ſuppoſing Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> "to call out aloud to a <hi>maſk'd Ruffian</hi> (whom he had obſerved to come <hi>behind</hi> his <hi>Friend</hi> and give him a <hi>ſound Drubbing</hi>) that if the Villain would but <hi>ſhow his Face,</hi> or <hi>tell his Name,</hi> he <hi>would grind him to Powder,</hi>" he tells us, that <q>
                  <hi>juſt ſo</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Don Quixote, <hi>meeting</hi> a few Merchants, cried out, Let the whole World ſtand ſtill, and if the whole World will not confeſs, affirm, and ſwear, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs <hi>Dulcinea</hi> (who by the Bye was only a common Trollop) is the moſt beautiful Damſel in the World, I challenge you all to Battle.</q> Now as it may poſſibly happen, that ſome of my Readers may be as ſtupid as I was upon the firſt Reading of this Paſſage, and not comprehend the leaſt Reſemblance between Don Quixote's <hi>meeting</hi> a <hi>few Merchants</hi> Face to Face, and Mr. <hi>H—s</hi>'s <hi>obſerving</hi> a <hi>maſk'd Ruffian</hi> to come <hi>behind</hi> his <hi>Friend, &amp;c.</hi> I ſhall endeavour to give them ſuch Lights into this Matter as I have, by Dint of hard Study, or otherwiſe, been able to procure. I ſuppoſe then the <hi>"few Merchants"</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to allude to thoſe of that Profeſſion among the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſters,</hi> who, it muſt be acknowledged, did at firſt <hi>ſhow their Faces,</hi> and <hi>tell their Names;</hi> but, as they afterwards put on their <hi>Viſors,</hi> and acted a baſe, aſſaſſinating Part,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:010014_0016_0F7B988082551F48"/>
they then became <hi>maſk'd Ruffians,</hi> reſembling the one Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> obſerved to come <hi>behind</hi> his Friend. But what Affinity there is between the DON's challenging the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants <hi>to Battle</hi> if they <hi>did not confeſs</hi> that <hi>Dulcinea</hi> was the moſt beautiful Damſel in the World, and Mr. <hi>H—s</hi>'s threatning the <hi>maſk'd Ruffian</hi> that if he <hi>did confeſs</hi> his <hi>own Name,</hi> or <hi>ſhew his Face,</hi> he would <hi>grind him to Powder,</hi> is what I have not yet been able to diſcover; and I am apprehenſive, that if the <hi>"whole World was to ſtand ſtill"</hi> till Doom's-day in the Afternoon, the <hi>whole World</hi> would not even then comprehend a Whit more of the Matter than myſelf. — I was alſo for a long Time puzzled to find the correſpondent Part of the Simile belonging to <hi>"common Trollop,"</hi> when luckily for me, a worthy <hi>Friend</hi> ſuggeſted that it muſt certainly be "ſound <hi>Drubbing;</hi>" for that our Author having ſome Time ago taken it into his Head to treat a virtuous young Woman at <hi>Frankford,</hi> as if ſhe had been really a <hi>common Trollop,</hi> ſhe ſnatch'd up a Broomſtick and gave him ſuch a terrible <hi>"ſound Drubbing,"</hi> that he has not ſince been able to ſeparate the Ideas. How this may be, I can't ſay, but I think the Solution ingenious, and that it has an Air of Probability.</p>
            <p>BUT ſhould our Author not have properly fitted the ſeveral Parts of his Simile, great Allowance ought to be made for a Man who has been ſo long <hi>obſerving</hi> in the <hi>Dark,</hi> that his very Underſtanding has become <hi>darken'd.</hi> On this Account I can readily excuſe his ſaying, That <q>as his Quarrel with Mr. <hi>H—s</hi>'s Friend was of a <hi>publick</hi> Nature, he would treat him <hi>accordingly;</hi>
               </q> which, to be ſure, he has <hi>accordingly</hi> done by keeping himſelf <hi>private.</hi> The ſame Conſideration too prompts me to readily paſs over ſeveral of his <hi>Grammatical Errors</hi> without Cenſure, particularly where he tells us, that <q>if any <hi>Perſon</hi> of Character who <hi>is</hi> known to be capable of writing an Advertiſement, will, to ſave Trouble, mention what Part of the Anſwer ſtands in need of further Proof, THEY will find the Satisfaction THEY deſire.</q> Beſides I do
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010014_0017_0F7B9880F0C759B8"/>
not ſee any Reaſon why learned Doctors and Profeſſors in a College ſhould be compell'd to the Obſervance of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar Rules: It is ſufficient that they <hi>endeavour</hi> to teach them to others. Perſons who are really <hi>"capable of writing an Advertiſement"</hi> would merit our Cenſure, perhaps, were they not to write grammatically; but as our learned Doctors and Profeſſors cannot, with any Propriety, be included among thoſe, they are therefore very excuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>AS I profeſs myſelf to be a mere Imitator, I ought, according to the Example of our Author, in the Paragraph before me, give you a long String of <hi>Suppoſitions</hi> founded upon <hi>falſe</hi> Repreſentations. But as I have not exhauſted a Hundredth Part of the Stock of <hi>Truths</hi> I am poſſeſſed of againſt him and his Employers, I think I may be excuſed having Recourſe to <hi>Falſities</hi> till the ſaid Stock is nearly expended. The following <hi>Suppoſitions</hi> therefore, muſt be conſidered as having Truth for their Baſis, and conſequently ſo far deviating from thoſe of our Author. <hi>Suppoſe</hi> then, that ſome "dreadful <hi>Giant</hi> or <hi>Knight</hi>" ſhould, partly from the Malice and Envy of his Heart, and partly to oblige his Superior the great HABERDASHER of <hi>Grace-Church-Street,</hi> determine to deſtroy the <hi>Champion</hi> who guarded the <hi>Golden Fruit,</hi> called <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Privileges,</hi> belonging to the People of <hi>Quilſylvania,</hi> which the ſaid <hi>Haberdaſher</hi> wanted to get into his Poſſeſſion. <hi>Suppoſe</hi> that the ſaid <hi>Giant</hi> ſhould for this Purpoſe take to his Aſſiſtance eight or nine of the moſt wicked and obedient of his Vaſſals and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and attack the Champion openly in the Highway, hoping that by their united Strength they ſhould totally overpower him. <hi>Suppoſe,</hi> however, that the Champion ſhould prove too hard for them all, and not only <q>heartily belabour the <hi>Knight</hi>'s Ribs,</q> but alſo give his <hi>Vaſſals</hi> and <hi>Attendants</hi> a "ſound Drubbing." <hi>Suppoſe</hi> then, that as they were afraid to venture to attack the Champion again, and yet were determined on his Deſtruction, that the <hi>Haberdaſher</hi> might be gratified in his Deſires, they ſhould
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010014_0017_0F7B9880F0C759B8"/>
hire a Number of <hi>Bravos</hi> to aſſaſſinate him. <hi>Suppoſe</hi> that thoſe <hi>Bravos</hi> ſhould likewiſe be afraid to engage the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion <hi>face</hi> to <hi>face,</hi> and ſhould therefore take an Opportunity of coming behind his Back, when he was ſo buſily employed as not to have it in his Power to turn upon them again, and then fire upon him from ſome Buſhes where they lay concealed. <hi>Suppoſe</hi> that a <hi>Friend</hi> of the Champion's, upon hearing the Report of their Guns, ſhould come up to his Aſſiſtance; but not being able to diſcover where the Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins were hid, ſhould call upon them to come forth, and that he would engage them in Behalf of his Friend. <hi>Suppoſe</hi> that inſtead of accepting this Challenge, they ſhould continue in their <hi>Lurking-Places,</hi> and from thence alſo diſcharge a Volley at the Perſon who had acted ſo bravely and honourably. Muſt we not then neceſſarily <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> them to be a Set of <hi>mean-ſpirited, daſtardly Wretches,</hi> who ought not only to be expelled the Community, but driven from the Face of the Earth?—"And now (as <hi>Bayes</hi> ſays in the <hi>Rehearſal</hi>) pray, Mr. Author, what becomes of YOUR <hi>Suppoſes?</hi>"</p>
            <p>HAVING now done with our Author, and as I am not the leaſt deſirous of ſtaying longer in his Company than is neceſſary for his Chaſtiſement, I ſhall diſmiſs him with this Advice of <hi>Sancho</hi>'s, viz. <q>Let every Man take Care how he <hi>ſpeaks</hi> or <hi>writes</hi> of <hi>honeſt People,</hi> and not ſet down at a Venture the firſt Thing that comes into his <hi>Jolterhead.</hi>
               </q> —But perhaps he may look upon me as an Enemy, and not regard the Council, nor wholeſome Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, I have beſtow'd upon him. Let me therefore recommend to his <hi>worthy Patron,</hi> if he has any Regard for <hi>his own</hi> Credit, to take his "blundering <hi>Squire</hi>" aſide, and lecture him as the renowned <hi>Don Quixote</hi> did his <hi>Squire</hi> on a ſimilar Occaſion. <q>Tell me, ſaid the <hi>Knight,</hi> thou modern <hi>Buffoon,</hi> and ancient <hi>Blockhead!</hi> Was it thy Province to <hi>diſhonour</hi> and <hi>affront</hi> a Perſon ſo <hi>worthy of Reverence and Reſpect.</hi> For the Love of God, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſet a Guard upon thy <hi>Tongue,</hi> and behave ſo as that the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:010014_0018_0F7B9881AF2ED798"/>
People may not diſcover by the <hi>Thread,</hi> the <hi>coarſe Country Web</hi> of which thou art woven: Conſider, <hi>Sinner as thou art,</hi> that the <hi>Maſter</hi> is reſpected <hi>in Proportion</hi> to the <hi>Diſcretion</hi> and <hi>Good-Breeding</hi> of his <hi>Servants;</hi> and <hi>this</hi> is <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>great Advantages</hi> which Noblemen have over People of inferior Rank: Doſt thou not conſider, thou <hi>Plague to thyſelf</hi> and <hi>Vexation to me!</hi> that if they perceive <hi>Thee</hi> to be a <hi>baſe bred Clown</hi> or <hi>blundering Fool,</hi> they will take <hi>me</hi> for ſome <hi>cheating Impoſtor</hi> or <hi>Knight of the Poſt:</hi> No, no, <hi>Sancho,</hi> ſhun and avoid thoſe Inconveniencies; for, he who ſets up for a <hi>Merry-Andrew,</hi> falls at the firſt Stumble into a <hi>diſgraced Buffoon:</hi> Bridle thy <hi>Tongue,</hi> therefore, <hi>conſider</hi> and <hi>ruminate</hi> well before the Words iſſue from thy Mouth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AND now, tremendous Sir! having thus exhorted your <hi>Squire,</hi> be pleaſed to accept of a little cordial Admonition for yourſelf: Part of which ſhall be another Extract from the Hiſtory of <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> a Work I am vaſtly pleaſed to ſee quoted by your <hi>Squire,</hi> as it gives me an Opportunity (as I profeſs <hi>Imitation</hi>) of quoting it likewiſe. It is indeed a favourite Book with me, and I don't care how often in the Courſe of our Diſputes I may be referred to a Work of ſuch infinite Wit and Humour. It contains beſides a vaſt Fund of ſerious Inſtruction, and I heartily adviſe you to endeavour to deſerve the Character which <hi>Sancho</hi> has given of that renowned <hi>Knight;</hi> My <q>Maſter (ſays he) has Nothing at all <hi>miſchevious</hi> about him; on the contrary is <hi>as dull as a Beetle,</hi> and knows not what it is to <hi>harm</hi> Man, Woman, or Child, or to <hi>harbour the leaſt Malice,</hi> but <hi>ſeeks to do good unto all Mankind:</hi> One of the Articles ſtipulated between us was that I might <hi>talk</hi> as much as I pleaſed, <hi>provided</hi> it was not <hi>Scandal</hi> againſt my Neighbour.</q> —Perhaps, Sir, you may think there will be no great Obſtacle to your acquiring the <hi>Beetle</hi> Part of the Character, as Nature has already been ſo very aſſiſtant, and therefore conclude, that it is not worth your while to attempt it, as no <hi>Merit</hi> would reſult to you ſhould you

ſucceed in a Point of ſo little Difficulty: But then you ſhould likewiſe conſider, that in attempting to deſerve the other Parts of the Character, you will then have <hi>Nature</hi> to <hi>combat with;</hi> and, conſequently, ſhould Succeſs attend your Endeavours, you will <hi>merit</hi> and <hi>obtain</hi> the Reward of a <hi>good Conſcience!</hi> —and the <hi>ſincere Applauſe</hi> of your <hi>Fellow-Citizens!</hi> Rewards (however <hi>light</hi> they may appear in your preſent Eſtimation) that would afford you more true heart-feeling Satisfaction, could you but once acquire them, than any you ever yet experienced! — or ever had any Idea of!</p>
            <p>IT is, however, but equitable I ſhould mention, that <hi>Sancho</hi> has groſsly miſrepreſented his Maſter with regard to his <hi>Underſtanding;</hi> and indeed <hi>Squires</hi> are very apt to talk diſreſpectfully of their <hi>Knights</hi> behind their Backs, as is well known to be the Practice of the One you at preſent employ. The <hi>Don</hi> was really a Man of <hi>fine Senſe</hi> and <hi>ſtrict Honour,</hi> and, could you but imitate him in theſe Reſpects, you would find that whatever Follies and Extravagancies you might at Times commit, would only excite <hi>Laughter,</hi> or <hi>Pity,</hi> inſtead of that <hi>Ridicule</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> you now ſuffer.</p>
