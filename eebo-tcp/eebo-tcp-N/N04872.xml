            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER TO Mr. JEDIDIAH MILLS.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is commonly obſerved, (and perhaps juſtly) that young Authors are impatient to hear, what Opinion the World entertains of their firſt Performance. I hope therefore, that you will take it in good Part, that I let you know what Eſteem I have of your firſt Piece, intitled, <hi>A Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Goſpel-Truth,</hi> &amp;c. — Perhaps you might have been better pleas'd, if the Doctor to whom you directed it, had undertaken this Work himſelf. And the only Apology that I can make for his ſeeming Neglect, is this; that as St. <hi>Paul</hi> directed the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. vi. 4. when they had any Controverſy about temporal Affairs, <hi>to ſet them to judge and determine them who were leaſt eſteemed in the Church,</hi> becauſe it was an Office too mean for thoſe of the higheſt Form: ſo it is our Method in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to appoint Men of the ſmalleſt Talents to repulſe the feebleſt Aſſaults, while thoſe of the Doctor's Abilities are better employ'd. — However, though I can't afford you that Honour, which a Reply from the Doctor would have done you; yet this I dare engage, that no Man can treat you with greater Integrity and Openneſs of Heart than I ſhall do. And to begin, without Flattery I can aſſure you, that I eſteem your Performance as to the Subſtance of it to be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unanſwerable; and that you have demonſtrated the main Propoſition you undertook to prove beyond all Poſſibility of a Contradiction. And I don't think, that ever any Body to the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006093_0004_102783E6DF968C40"/>End of Time will be found ſo unreaſonable, as to attempt to diſprove it; and that becauſe no Man yet ſince the Creation ever denied it. For you tell us, that you <q>grant, there are conditional Promiſes in the Scriptures to Sinners.</q> P. 10. Now this is the utmoſt that thoſe whom you call <hi>Arminians</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to.</p>
            <p>But what you contend for, you ſay, is this, That <hi>there are no Promiſes of the Beſtowment of ſpecial Grace, made in the Scripture to unregenerate Sinners, on Condition of any Endeavours, Strivings, or Doings of theirs whatſoever.</hi> P. 10. Now, fair Diſputants who fear not the Light becauſe their Tenets are evil, always take Care, when they ſtate their Queſtion, to explain their Terms.— But you have left yours in the utmoſt Ambiguity: By which Means you began, continued, and ended the Diſpute in the Clouds. And though I have read over your Letter ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Times, with the utmoſt Attention I am capable of; yet I am really at a Loſs to know what you would have us believe in the Affair. For,</p>
            <p n="1">I. By ſpecial Grace the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> mean thoſe Operations of the Holy Spirit upon our Souls which will irreſiſtably and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruſtrably bring them to Heaven. Now if you uſe the Words <hi>ſpecial Grace</hi> in this Senſe (as no Doubt you do) then you mean, that GOD has no where promiſed to beſtow irreſiſtable Grace upon unconverted Men, whatever Pains they may take for it.</p>
            <p>And I dare be Surety for every <hi>Arminian</hi> in the Nation, that he will join with you. For they are ſo far from believing that GOD has promiſed ſpecial Grace in this Senſe to Sinners for any Endeavours of theirs, that they believe he has not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it all, either conditionally, or unconditionally, either to Saints or Sinners. But,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly,</hi> The Terms <hi>Special Grace</hi> do properly ſignify thoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Favours and Privileges which belong only to good Men; ſuch as the Pardon of Sin, the peculiar Guidance and Comforts of the Holy Ghoſt, and a Right to eternal Happineſs. Now if your Propoſition be underſtood in this Senſe, you muſt mean, that there are no Promiſes in the holy Bible, declaring that GOD will give Pardon and eternal Life, to wicked Men, while they remain ſuch, notwithſtanding any Endeavours of theirs which come ſhort of a ſincere Compliance with the Terms of Salvation. And I am perſuaded there is no Man living, but who will join with you in this. I am therefore humbly of the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006093_0005_102783EB6927FAF0"/>Opinion, that you had no more Occaſion to write ſo largely to prove it, than to ſpend Two Years in proving that Light is not Darkneſs. Indeed Brother, if inſtead of proving that GOD has not promiſed ſpecial, <hi>i.e.</hi> irreſiſtable Grace to the Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate for any Doings of theirs, you had proved that he has promiſed ſuch Grace at all; or that it is neceſſary to Converſion; or that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and preventing Grace rightly improved will never end in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace; this would have been to the Purpoſe; this would have been a <hi>Refutation</hi> of the Doctor's Errors, whom you pretend to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and a Confirmation of Mr. <hi>Cook's</hi> Sermon, which you profeſs to defend. But inſtead of this, you have feigned ſuch an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, as never exiſted but in your own Imagination; And this chimerical Antagoniſt you have manfully attack'd, irreſiſtably conquered, and moſt unmercifully triumph'd over and expos'd to Shame. You have taken much Pains to <hi>refute dangerous Errors,</hi> and anſwer weak Objections, which never had any being, before you dream'd of them; and I dare ſay would have lain in their Non-Entity to Eternity, had it not been for the creative Power of your Fancy.</p>
            <p>By an <hi>unregenerate</hi> Man, you mean, one who does not conſent to the Terms of Salvation. And by <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi> you mean, Salvation begun and ſecured, ſo that it cannot be loſt. Therefore to ſay, that an unregenerate Man has a Promiſe of ſpecial Grace for ſome Doings of his, while he remains unregenerate, is the ſame as to ſay, that a wicked Man has the Promiſe of Salvation, while he remains wicked, for ſome wicked Doings of his; or at leaſt, for ſome Endeavours of his, which have not the leaſt Degree of moral Goodneſs in them. It is the ſame, as to ſay, that a Man has GOD's Promiſe for Salvation, although he does not comply with the Condition of the Promiſe. That it was your great Deſign to diſprove this Error, not only your ſtating the Queſtion, but the whole Strain of your Reaſoning ſhews. — And can you, Sir, in earneſt believe, that the Doctor, or any Man living entertains ſuch an Opinion as this? For this is to believe, that both Parts of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction are true; that a Man may be regenerate, and unregenerate at the ſame Time and in the ſame Senſe; and that he may have a Covenant-Right to Salvation; and yet never conſent to the Terms of Salvation propounded in the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>You tell us in your Preface, that this is a <hi>Covenant of Man's own deviſing;</hi> and I heartily join with you, and give you the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006093_0006_102783ECFB419610"/>Honour of this <hi>new <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Covenant,</hi> for I profeſs, I believe no Man ever hit upon this new Device, but only Mr. <hi>Mills.</hi> And to be ſerious with you, with what Conſcience could you charge ſuch wretched Whims upon the Doctor? And pray with what Honeſty could you feign yourſelf ſo horribly affrighted at him, as to make that hideous Outcry P. 32, where you expreſs yourſelf thus: <hi>Here, Sir, being ſtruck with the utmoſt Surprize, I muſt beg leave to pauſe a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as not able ſuddenly to reſolve what is beſt to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> &amp;c. If one of the infernal Spirits had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to you, could you have expreſt your Amazement in ſtronger Terms? I may venture to appeal to all who know the Force of Language, whether the obvious Meaning of your Words be not this? the Doctor is ſuch a Prodigy for Hereſy or Villainy, that to read a few of his Lines is enough to ſtrike one's Soul with Amazement. Whatever you may think of it, Sir, this is but a very mean, tho' an effectual Method of ſlander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry to obſerve the like Inſtance of your Uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards the Doctor in Page 3<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. where you undertake to acquaint the World what was the Occaſion of the <hi>Doctor's</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this Subject, which according to you was this, there has lately been a wonderful Seaſon for the Converſion of Souls from Satan to Chriſt, and vaſt Numbers have in a ſhort Time experienced a bleſſed Change of their Hearts from Sin to Holineſs, by the Grace of GOD. This nettled the Doctor to ſee Religion flouriſh ſo wonderfully, he thought it was high Time to beſtir himſelf; and try to put a Stop to the Growth of Chriſt's Kingdom, as it is ſaid of the Devil, Rev. xii. 12. <hi>He had great Wrath becauſe he knew, that he had but a ſhort Time.</hi> I will appeal to any Perſon who can diſcover a Man's Meaning by his Words if this be not the genuine Senſe of that Page.</p>
            <p>And if your ſo much boaſted Converſions produce no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Fruits among your People, than this horrible Cenſoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their Miniſter, I'll venture to ſay of all ſuch as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid of <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Levi; O my Soul come not thou into their Secret, unto their Aſſembly mine Honour be not thou united. Curſed be their</hi> Uncharitableneſs <hi>for it is fierce, and their</hi> Cenſoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>for it is cruel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor had told you his Motive to write, but you pretend to know his Heart, better than he himſelf did. And you won't allow <hi>GOD alone to know the Hearts of the Children

            <p>Beſides, there was no manner of Occaſion for this virulent and ill-natur'd Stroke: For the late Confuſion in this Country, ſince Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Journey through it, called a <hi>wonderful Revival of Religion,</hi> has occaſioned ten Perſons coming over to our Side of the Queſtion, to one who has deſerted it for yours. But I'm afraid this cenſuring and judging Men's Hearts, is no new Practice with you: becauſe you are ſo very ready to drag it in Head and Shoulders, without the leaſt Occaſion. — Becauſe I intend not to be tedious. I ſhall ſay no more of your Cenſoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and only mention one Inſtance out of many of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtencies. You tell us, P. 10. that the Goſpel gives <hi>great and precious Encouragements</hi> to unconverted Men to <hi>endeavour, ſtrive, and do:</hi> and that theſe <hi>Encouragements</hi> riſe in Proportion to their Diligence and Painfulneſs in doing good Works; this is certainly your Meaning, or you have no Meaning at all. And yet you tell us P. 56. and in many other Places, that it is utterly impoſſible for theſe unconverted Sinners by the beſt Improvement of common Grace, to do one Work that has any moral Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it, or that GOD can approve of. This too is evidently your Meaning. Now, Brother, pray tell me for the ſake of common Senſe, how thoſe Works which have no moral Good in them; but are ſinful, diſapproved and abhorred by GOD, can be ſuppoſed to intitle the Doer of them to <hi>great and precious Encouragements</hi> from GOD? Nay, that the <hi>Encouragements</hi> ſhould <hi>riſe in Proportion,</hi> as the Sinner abounds in doing theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral and ſinful Deeds? This is a Paradox, which ſurpaſſes my Comprehenſion. — Your Brethren, who were the chief Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of the late glorious Work in this Land, of which you boaſt ſo much, were not of your Mind, when they told diſtreſſed People, that <hi>their Prayers and Cries for Mercy were as diſagreeable to GOD as the Howlings of the Devils. And that he who lives in all kinds of Wickedneſs, ſtands a better Chance for Salvation than he who complies with the whole of his Duty ſincerely.</hi> I have heard one of the moſt ſober and modeſt of theſe Reformers declare to his Hearers, <hi>that there were many good and honeſt Men among them, who know nothing of GOD and Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Theſe Men are
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006093_0008_102783F350A2AAC0"/>throughout of a Piece: but you can blow both hot and cold in ſuch a ſtrange Manner, that I profeſs I know not what your Faith really is. But this I am ſure of, that ſince you hold, that both the Works of the unconverted are very valuable and have <hi>great and precious Encouragements</hi> annext to them; and yet are ſo vile and contemptible that there is not any moral Goodneſs in the beſt of them, you are certainly miſtaken on one Side or the other: becauſe both Parts of a Contradiction can't be true.</p>
            <p>But to return, Though as you have laid down your chief Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, every one will agree in the Truth of it; yet when you have made ſome Progreſs in your Diſcourſe, you attempt to prove much more than is contained in your firſt Aſſertion: viz. That there is no Certainty from the holy Scripture, that GOD will enable the ſtriving Sinner to comply with the Terms of Salvation. For whereas our bleſſed Saviour ſays, Matth. xxv. 29. <hi>Unto every on that hath ſhall be given, and he ſhall have Abundance. By this Expreſſion,</hi> you ſay is <hi>meant the final Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Glory is the future World.</hi> P. 26. Hence you infer, that it is no Promiſe that a weary and heavy laden Sinner, ſtriving ever ſo earneſtly ſhall be enabled to come to Chriſt. — To which I anſwer, though it be the Deſign of the Parable of the Talents to repreſent the Manner of the final Judgment; yet it is corrupting the Word of GOD, to confine this Aphoriſm to that, and to ſay, that it does not import our receiving further Degree of Grace in this World, according to the Improvement we make of what we have received already. For it is a general Propoſition, and is fulfill'd in ten thouſand Inſtances beſides the final Judgment. Thus he who <hi>hath</hi> Reaſon, and improves it well, ſhall <hi>have more</hi> and ſhall grow in Underſtanding. He <hi>who hath</hi> a Memory, and uſes it well ſhall have it enlarged. What ever Talent a Man hath, if he improves it well, he ſhall have it inlarged and rewarded. So he who hath the common pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Grace of the Holy Spirit, and improves it by complying with GOD's Will as far as he is able, and who cannot do what he is able to do?) this Man has Chriſt's expreſs Declaration, that his Grace ſhall be increaſed into an <hi>Abundance.</hi> And if a Man <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ued with an Abundance of Grace cannot perform one <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Action,</hi> or do one ſingle Thing pleaſing to GOD, it muſt be a very ſtrange Sort of Grace indeed, not worth a having. — It is agreed on both Sides, that there is ſuch a Thing as common Grace, or the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>luences of the Holy Spirit upon all Men under the Goſpel, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ch only excepted as for their Obſtinacy are
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006093_0009_102783F65438D588"/>abandoned, having finally quench'd the Spirit.) And this Grace is given antecedently to any <hi>Seekings, Endeavours or Doings</hi> of ours. Now this Grace muſt be allowed to be a Talent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable; otherwiſe it is no Grace, or Favour. And if it be a Talent, he who improves it, is expreſly intitled by a Promiſe to <hi>Abundance</hi> of Grace. And he who has a Abundance of Grace, I humbly conceive, is in a State of Acceptance with GOD; and has what we mean by the Terms <hi>ſpecial Grace;</hi> though not irreſiſtible. Now to have Abundance of Grace, and yet be a wicked Man, is ſomething like the Thing called a <hi>Bull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, when our bleſſed Saviour ſays Matth. 7.7. <hi>aſk, and it ſhall be given you; ſeek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you; And GOD will give his Holy Spirit to them that aſk him.</hi> You will not allow this Promiſe, to belong to any, but ſuch as have already complied with the Terms of Salvation; No others however deſirous to pleaſe GOD, have any Right to it. And your Reaſon is, becauſe this aſking muſt be in <hi>unfeigned Faith,</hi> and none but converted Perſons have this Faith, P. 29. But, pray, how do you prove, that a Man who has not as yet ſincerely devoted himſelf to Chriſt, may not have this true Faith the next Moment, and be able to aſk aright; provided he will exert all that Strength which common and preventing Grace ſupplies him with? And if this be the Caſe, the Promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him. And that it is ſo, is very evident; for to ſay, that he who is now unconverted cannot by GOD's preventing Grace, while he aſks, ſeeks, and knocks in the beſt Manner (to him poſſible,) become a good Man, is to affirm, that Men who remain wicked continue ſuch, not through any Default of their own, but becauſe GOD will not give them ſufficient Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; which is to charge their Impenitency on GOD. For who can blame the Man that does the utmoſt that he can? And indeed, this is all that GOD requires of us, that we ſhould love and ſerve him with all our Strength. And verily, If a Man has no more than our common Grace, and improves it as well as he poſſibly can, I do not ſee why he ſhould not be as acceptable to GOD, who is no Reſpecter of Perſons, as if he had your ſpecial Grace. For he who has your <hi>ſpecial Grace</hi> can do no more than he can, which he that has common Grace is ſuppoſed to do. And <hi>when Chriſt ſays, aſk, and ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; ſeek, and ye ſhall find;</hi> it is a Command, and Promiſe to every one, good and bad, who hears the Goſpel. And it is your Preſumption to limit it, and confine it to godly Perſons.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006093_0010_102783F7D718F6C0"/>By which Device you make our gracious Redeemer ſpeak in this inſincere and diſſembling Manner. <hi>Aſk, and ye ſhall receive; ſeek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened to you; and GOD will give his Spirit to them that aſk.</hi> 
               <q>But while I utter theſe gracious Words, I have this mental Reſervation, provided you aſk in <hi>Faith unfeigned,</hi> which alas poor Wretches, you can no more do, than create a World. You imagine now my Hearers that I direct you, how to become good Men, and obtain eternal Life; but there is nothing farther from my real Intentions. I only put you upon doing Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities.</q> Now is it not a ſoul Imputation upon the holy Jeſus, in whoſe Mouth was no Guile, to ſuppoſe he would ſet Men to do Impoſſibilities, in order to obtain Salvation, under the Pretence of pointing out to them the right Way to eternal Life? No Man of common Honeſty would endure ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to be caſt upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>Again you tell us, P. 41. <hi>That the Suppoſition of any true moral Excellency and ſolid Goodneſs in the beſt poſſible Doings of the Unregenerate while ſuch, is but a meer Dream and vain Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This is your grand Argument, and runs through the whole, I ſhall therefore give it a ſhort, but full Anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If by this you mean, that all which a wicked Man does, while he refuſes to comply with the Terms of Salvation, will not intitle him to the ſpecial Favour of GOD; this is what no body denies, or needs to be taught. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. If by this you mean, that a Man who is not thoroughly good, never does what in any Degree is pleaſing to GOD, and morally good; you are miſtaken: For <hi>Ahab</hi> was a very wicked Man; yet ſome of his Actions had a Degree of moral Goodneſs in them; and were in ſome Meaſure pleaſing to God. 1 Kings xxi. 29. <hi>Seeſt thou how Ahab humbleth himſelf before me? Becauſe he humbleth himſelf before me, I will not bring the Evil in his Days: But in his Sons Days I will bring the Evil upon his Houſe.</hi> If <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Behaviour had had no moral Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it, GOD would not have taken ſuch Notice of it; nor have ſo rewarded it. The like is evident in <hi>Jehu,</hi> 2 Kings x. 30, 31. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Jehu, Becauſe thou haſt done well in executing that which was right in mine Eyes, and haſt done unto the Houſe of Ahab according to all that was in mine Heart, thy Children of the fourth Generation ſhall ſit upon the Throne of Iſrael. But Jehu took no heed to walk in the Law of the Lord GOD of Iſrael with all his Heart.</hi> If <hi>Jehu</hi>'s Conduct
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006093_0011_102783F963555D48"/>had not been in ſome Degree morally good and pleaſing to GOD, the <hi>Judge of all the Earth who will do right</hi> would not have requited it with ſuch a Reward. Chriſt ſaid to one, <hi>Thou art not far from the Kingdom of GOD.</hi> Now if no unconverted Man has any moral Goodneſs at all, then one is not nearer to the Kingdom of GOD than another; all being equally deſtitute of Goodneſs, and in the State of the Devils. It is therefore your Miſtake to ſay that all the beſt Endeavours of every one who hath not yet come up to the Terms of Salvation, have no moral Goodneſs in them. For as good Men are not in this Life perfectly good, and free from all moral Evil; ſo every wicked Man is not perfectly wicked and void of all moral Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that is, all wicked Men are not arrant Devils while in this Life. Well, but ſuppoſe, it were granted, that while we come ſhort of a ſincere Compliance with the Terms of Salvation, all we do is Sin; yet how does it follow, that we may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it, that if we do the beſt we can, GOD will help us to do ſome Thing that is not Sin? <hi>Without Faith we cannot pleaſe GOD:</hi> But how does it follow from thence, that if we ſtrive with all our Strength GOD's Spirit will not help us to a right Faith? Though we ſhould grant, that while Men remain wicked they do nothing but Sin, yet that is no Proof, that they can not do better; or that GOD is not ready to afford them that gracious Aſſiſtance by which they could <hi>ceaſe to do Evil and learn to do well.</hi> All GOD's Commands, Calls, and Invitations to Sinners to believe, repent, to turn and live, imply that GOD will afford them ſufficient Grace to do what he requires. For his Commands are Indications of his Will. And GOD cannot will that which is impoſſible: It being a Weakneſs that the Almighty cannot be ſubject to. And he who commands what he knows is impoſſible, does not deſire or intend to be obeyed, And who dare ſay, that when GOD by the Goſpel <hi>commands all Men every where to repent;</hi> that he does not will, or deſire, or intend to be obeyed? And if he does deſire to be obeyed, then he leaves none under an Impoſſibility to believe, and obey the Goſpel. And when GOD commands us to believe in Chriſt, it not only denotes, that we ſhould do ſo, but that we can believe. As when Chriſt commanded a dead Man to ariſe, and ſaid, <hi>Lazarus come forth;</hi> he at the ſame Time enabled him to obey, and come forth; orherwiſe he would not have laid ſuch a Command upon him; or given ſuch a Call. So when he commanded the Man who had a withered Hand, to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006093_0012_102783FFD3B787F8"/>ſtretch it out, it was equivalent to a Promiſe, that he ſhould be able to do ſo, provided he would try to obey. So GOD never commands Men to repent, and come to Chriſt, but he likewiſe puts it in their Power to do it. The Spirit accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies the Word, till Men by their obſtinacy have quenched it. And to ſay, that GOD commands Men to believe and repent and yet don't enable them to obey him, is to charge GOD with Folly and Cruelty. Folly, in that it ſuppoſes GOD Wills and deſires Impoſſibilities: and Cruelty, in that it ſuppoſes he requires that Service, which he gives no Strength to perform; like a Maſter who requires Work to be done by his Servant, but will afford him neither Maintenance nor Tools.</p>
            <p>Beſides, all baptiſed Perſons have a Covenant-Right to all the Aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt that is neceſſary in order to their obtaining Salvation. As Baptiſm is a Seal of the Covenant between the bleſſed Trinity and us; ſo when we are baptiſed into the Name of the Holy Ghoſt, he engages to be our Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifier, i. e. to do all that is neceſſary on his Part for our Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. If you deny that by Baptiſm we have a Covenant-Right to ſufficient Grace to ſanctify us, you thereby declare, that Baptiſm is an inſignificant Ceremony, a Sign without any Thing ſignified, a Seal without any Thing ſealed or engaged on the Part of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>If you ſay, tho' God does give us Power to believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, yet he does not give it as a Reward for any <hi>Strivings, Endeavours, or Doings of ears, while we are unregenerate.</hi> I reply, no Body imagines that he does ſo. We grant, that the Grace of GOD prevents us. GOD begins with us; not we with him. The Spirit moves us before ever we move in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The firſt Grace is beſtowed upon us before ever we aſk, ſeek, or knock. If GOD ſhould not give us Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we did ſomething pleaſing to him, or ſome morally good Action, to qualify us for Grace, or to merit Grace in the loweſt Senſe; we never ſhould receive any Grace at all. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your citing Texts, and Biſhop <hi>Hopkins,</hi> to prove this Point, was perfectly needleſs: And the Boaſting you mention about an Hundred Times, we readily acknowledge is excluded by Grace. And no Man can truly ſay, I ſought GOD be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had his Grace, and by my own Endeavours I gain'd a Right to the firſt Grace. This is ſo obvious a Truth, ſo conſtantly inculcated in our Liturgy as well as in the Holy Bible, that I never knew any Profeſſor of the Church of <hi>England</hi> doubt
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006093_0013_10278404679C9060"/>of it, and the Doctor himſelf aſſerts and inculcates it. For you therefore to repreſent it as tho' this was the Point in Conteſt, if it be not Slandering, yet it muſt be accounted an inexcuſable Blunder.</p>
            <p>Another Thing I would obſerve, you inſiſt upon is, that it is very <hi>wrong to pray for converting Grace under the Notion of its being a promiſed Favour.</hi> But in this I muſt differ from you, and can't help thinking, that to pray for it under the Notion of a promiſed Mercy is the only right Method. For when we aſk for converting Grace we ſhould pray for it <hi>with full Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Faith</hi> as knowing that what we aſk for is agreeable to the Will of GOD, becauſe as the Apoſtle tells us <hi>this is the Will of GOD even our Sanctification.</hi> But it is a ſinful Preſumption to aſk abſolutely for any Thing which GOD has not promiſed. And we muſt pray for nothing but what we can aſk in Faith. <hi>For whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin:</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi> ſays, <hi>Let him aſk in Faith nothing wavering, James</hi> i. 6. Now where there is no divine Promiſe, there can be no divine Faith. GOD's Word and Promiſe is the only ſolid Foundation of Faith and Hope. So that if there were no other Argument againſt your Hypotheſis, yet this alone is ſufficient to overthrow it.</p>
            <p>I'll now take Notice of the ill Conſequences which you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, flow from our Doctrine, which is that GOD affords all Men ſufficient Grace to become good Men. <hi>This,</hi> ſay you, <hi>is likely is bear down and keep under the Sinner's riſing Fears from Time to Time, to ſooth and huſh his accuſing Conſcience, and while in Heart really purſuing the World as his chief Good, yet to flatter him with the Hopes of his finally obtaining Heaven too; as having the Grace of GOD well ſecured to him by a conditional Promiſe, and brought hereby as it were within the Command of his own Endeavours and Improvements.</hi> — And this you call a <hi>Self-pleaſing Opinion,</hi> P. 62. To which I reply; If by the <hi>Grace of GOD's being brought as it were within the Command of our Endeavours and Improvements,</hi> you mean, that as we improve or neglect the Grace of GOD, ſo it is either increaſed, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from us, this is a moſt evident Truth. When Men <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Grace of GOD in vain, when they grieve and quench the Spirit and reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (as the Scripture expreſſes it) GOD's <hi>Spirit will not always ſtrive with them;</hi> but will withdraw his Influences, and leave them to Hardneſs of Heart. But on the other Hand, when Men concur with the bleſſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006093_0014_10278405E97FEAA8"/>of the Spirit <hi>he gives more Grace,</hi> James iv. 6. When they cheriſh the kind Motions of Grace, this bleſſed Gueſt pays their Souls more frequent Viſits, and operates more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully upon them, till <hi>they are changed into the Image of the Lord, from Glory to Glory, by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. iii. 18.</p>
            <p>But now, how this Scripture-Doctrine ſhould be likely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Sinners to delay Repentance, as you ſay, is paſt my Comprehenſion. We teach, that the longer a Sinner delays his Repentance, the leſs Reaſon there is to hope, that he will ever repent; for the more the Spirit will be grieved, and he <hi>hardened through the Deceitfulneſs of Sin;</hi> and after a while the bleſſed Comforter may finally abandon him, ſo that he ſhall never have any Inclination to repent. And tho' this ſhould not happen to be his Caſe, yet he is ſure of no Opportunity but the preſent to repent in; becauſe Life is uncertain, and <hi>we know not what a Day may bring forth.</hi> So that the delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinner may die before the Seaſon comes, in which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to repent, and then he is loſt forever. So that he who repents not to Day has no <hi>Command</hi> of either Grace or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to repent to Morrow. Where then lies the Danger of our Doctrine's <hi>ſoothing and huſhing Sinners Conſciences in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying Repentance?</hi> But your Doctrine has a real Tendency to this. For according to you Men muſt delay their Repentance whether they will, or no, till GOD's Time comes to give them Repentance; which indeed may never come. For you teach, that Converſion is the Work of GOD alone, an Effect of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power, as much as raiſing the Dead; and therefore does not depend upon any Thing we can do, any more than our Reſurrection when we are Dead. And as all dead Men muſt reſt in their Graves, till GOD's Time to raiſe them comes, ſo muſt the wicked patiently wait till GOD ſees fit to convert them. And if they Strive to be converted, yet all their Strivings, Endeavours, and Doings are nothing but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, offending GOD and making bad worſe. So that if it were poſſible for me to believe your Doctrine, and at the ſame Time to have one Spark of Reaſon remain in me, it would effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually <hi>huſh and ſooth my Conſcience in delaying my Repentance,</hi> till ſpecial Grace was granted, and that being irreſiſtible tho' it came but at the laſt Breath of a moſt wicked Life yet would it ſecure my Admiſſion into Heaven; and my antecedent Strivings would not haſten my Converſion one Moment, nor my Careleſneſs and Lazineſs in the leaſt Degree retard it—
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006093_0015_1027840789DEA068"/>Now let common Senſe determine which of theſe Hypotheſis does moſt encourage Sinners to delay Repentance.</p>
            <p>You tell us, that ours is a <hi>ſelf pleaſing Opinion.</hi> And I heartily agree with you: For it is agreeable to the moral Senſe of all Mankind, and their natural Notions of the Deity; but your's is an Affront to common Reaſon, repugnant to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Notions which Mankind have of GOD, and is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by every Man's Experience, who feels, and is conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to himſelf that GOD gives him Power to refuſe the Evil, and Chuſe the Good. And the Mind muſt be ſtrangely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd before it can receive your Scheme without great Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glings and Reluctance: Tho' Education and Cuſtom will make any Thing eaſy, however abhorrent to Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Another evil Fruit of our Doctrine in your Opinion is, that it <hi>cheriſhes Pride</hi> and <hi>ſinful Boaſting,</hi> whereas yours is <hi>a Soul-humbling Doctrine.</hi> But wherein I beſeech you lies the Pride and Arrogance of ſaying as we do, I am not ſufficient of myſelf ſo much as to think one good Tho't, but yet I have ſo honourable an Opinion of GOD's Mercy, that I make no Doubt but that his Grace will be ſufficient for me, ſo that I can do what he commands me to his Acceptance, and if I fail of Salvation, it will not be thro' any Defect of GOD's Grace towards me, but it will be purely owing to my not doing what he would have enabled me to do? Was it Pride in St. <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay, <hi>I can do all Things thro' Chriſt ſtrengthening me?</hi> Is it Arrogance to ſay, I am under no Neceſſity to be wicked, for <hi>GOD don't ſuffer me to be tempted above what I am able?</hi> It appears to me, a much more humbling Thought, when I have done wickedly in any Inſtance, to reflect that it was not for Want of divine Aſſiſtance, but for want of uſing it, that I am now plunged in Guilt. And if I had done my beſt Endeavour I might have been a Child of GOD; whereas now I am a Child of the Devil. This, I ſay, is a more aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Reflection than to ſay according to your Scheme, I am wicked becauſe GOD never put it in my Power to be any other than wicked; nor to do one morally good Deed: the ſovereign Will of GOD, and <hi>Adam's</hi> firſt Sin is the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating Cauſe of all my Sin. Which is the moſt abaſing Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that which charges our Impenitency and Wickedneſs upon GOD and our firſt Parents: or that which lays it at our own Door? This is a juſt ſtating of the Queſtion, If I can't poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly do any Thing but Sin, (as you teach) then I have no more Reaſon to be humbled and troubled in Conſcience for it,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006093_0016_102784098A08E8A0"/>than for any Diſtemper or natural Blemiſh in my Body. If I am born to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>Now as Dr. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> obſerves, <q>He that is once poſſeſſed with this Perſuaſion that all the Sins which he can poſſibly commit, were they as many as have been committed by all Mankind ſince the Beginning of the World, are not able to fruſtrate his Election, or ſeparate him from the Love and Favour of Almighty GOD, will be too apt to ſwell with phariſaical Pride, and deſpiſe all other Men as Heathens and Publicans, when ſuch poor Publicans as have their Minds humble and relying on GOD, will ſtand a-loof, not during to approach too near the divine Majeſty, but crying out with, <hi>GOD be merciful unto me a Sinner.</hi> For this we need produce no Proof, we find it in the ſupercilious Looks and haughty Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of thoſe who are ſo well aſſured of their own Election; who cannot ſo diſguiſe themſelves, as not to undervalue and deſpiſe all thoſe who are not of the ſame Party with them: A Race of Men whoſe Inſolence and Pride there is no avoiding.</q> And ſcarce a Pamphlet do they publiſh, without boaſting of the Piety of their Party, as if all true Piety was confined to them, and nothing but the Form belonged to us.</p>
            <p>Two or three Things more I ſhall take Notice of, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude. Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi> in the Sermon which you undertook to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, in proving that there are no Promiſes to the Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, advanced this Argument, viz. <hi>If GOD hate bound himſelf by his Promiſe to his Creatures, he is no more at perfect Liberty either to grant or withhold the promiſed Bleſſing, as may pleaſe him:</hi> Which Argument carries this Senſe, or none at all to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and when drawn out into proper Form ſtands thus:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:006093_0017_1026E7B616ED85A8"/>
               <hi>If GOD has bound himſelf by his Promiſe to his Creatures, he is no more at <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Liberty either to grant or with-hold the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Bleſſing as may pleaſe him. But GOD being abſolutely ſovereign, is at <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Liberty either to grant or with-hold his Bleſſing as pleaſeth him;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore God hath not bound himſelf to his Creatures by his Promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, ſays the Doctor, <q>Surely if this Argument proves any Thing, it proves that no Promiſe at all, to good or bad is conſiſtent with the divine Sovereignty; and then where is there any Place for any New Covenant, or indeed old either? And if the Caſe be ſo, away with the Bible ſure enough.</q> Which is as juſt a Remark as ever was made, and as well grounded. And yet for this you ſpend Page after Page in loading the Doctor with your Obloquies and Revilings, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with <hi>Untruths, Miſtakes, grand Miſtakes, Cenſoriouſneſs, Unchriſtian Reflections.</hi> Thus foul and abuſive Language ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the Place of ſolid Reaſoning.</p>
            <p>And then <hi>P.</hi> 15. you gravely ask, <hi>If theſe Words of Mr.</hi> Cooke's <hi>be not moſt evidently true?</hi> To which I anſwer, that as a Cypher ſtanding alone is no Number, ſo this Sentence when it ſtands ſingly and by it ſelf, is true and harmleſs, but as it ſtands in Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi>'s Sermon, and is uſed by him as a Medium, or Argument to prove, that there are no Promiſes to the Unregenerate, it is a moſt groſs and pernicious Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, and if admitted, as the Doctor obſerves, it will follow, there are no Promiſes of GOD to any Creature, becauſe they would be inconſiſtent with that Notion of Sovereignty which he was preaching up. And your not perceiving this muſt certainly be owing to ſome Defect either in your Head, or Heart, but in which, GOD, and I believe, your own Conſcience knows.</p>
            <p>Again, the Doctor had obſerved, <q>that nothing can ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually tend to tempt us to entertain hard Thoughts of GOD, and cut the Sinews of all Endeavours to do our Duty as even the moſt diſtant Surmize, that poſſibly all our Labour may be in vain, ſince for ought we know, we may be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely excluded from all Poſſibility of ſucceeding by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable Decree of Reprobation.</q> In remarking upon this, you make the beſt Show of Reaſoning of any Part of your Performance. For, ſay you, <hi>Doth not the Huſbandman plow in Hope without the leaſt Certainty of Succeſs?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that is becauſe the Huſbandman believes nothing of your Doctrine; but whatever idle Speculations of Fate and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006093_0018_102784129393B030"/>abſolute Predeſtination may ſwim in his Brain, yet in his hearty and predominant Belief he is an <hi>Arminian.</hi> For did the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman heartily believe, that it was abſolutely decreed, that he ſhould, or ſhould not have a Crop, and that without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his Plowing, as you pretend to believe, that Men are elected, or reprobated without Foreſight of their Faith or Works, and did he believe that Plowing and Sowing were the ſole Work of GOD alone, and done by an irreſiſtable Power, as you believe Converſion is; I care ſay, he would neither plow, ſow, nor reap, until Experience had taught him a more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Faith. But Men are not ſo eaſily cheated with falſe Schemes in their temporal, as in their ſpiritual Concerns; as Chriſt has obſerved, <hi>The Children of this World are wiſer in their Generation than the Children of Light.</hi> And the Doctor's Obſervation is very juſt, for what Madneſs is it to ſtrive to alter an abſolute Decree of Heaven, in the making of which there was no Regard to what we would or could do in Time?</p>
            <p>Let us now hear the Concluſion of the whole Matter. The Queſtion between us is this, <hi>whether there be any Certainty, that a Sinner, with the Aſſiſtance of common Grace, continuing to ſtrive as earnſtly and as regularly as he poſſibly can, will ever find Mercy at the Hands of GOD?</hi> You hold the Negative, and we the Affirmative. <hi>That Party</hi> (as you ſay who) <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> right Side of the Queſtion, have the true Goſpel;</hi> but they <hi>who are in the wrong Side of it, have only a Goſpel of Man's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing.</hi> To which I ſay, AMEN.</p>
            <p>Your Evidence when ſummed up, is this, the beſt that an unconverted Sinner can do while ſuch, has <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> true moral Goodneſs in it; therefore it is unreaſonable to ſupoſe that GOD ſhould aſcertain ſpecial Grace to the Performance of ſuch defective and ſinful Doings. To which we anſwer; this is nothing at all to the Purpoſe. For tho' it be granted—that while a Man does not give up himſelf ſincerely and intirely to GOD in Chriſt, he does no Duty to GOD's final Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; yet it does not from thence follow, that he cannot by GOD's preventing Grace ſo ſincerely watch and pray and ſtrive as thereby to be ſo far accepted as to become certainly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for further and effectually ſaving Grace. And though <hi>they who are in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe GOD,</hi> yet it does not from thence follow that they cannot by the Help of GOD's Grace come out of that wretched State, and then pleaſe him.</p>
            <p>The grand Sophiſm and Fallacy which runs through the whole of your Reaſoning is this, Unregenerate Men whilſt they
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006093_0019_102784171A1A3C58"/>remain ſuch can do nothing in a ſpecial Senſe pleaſing to GOD; therefore you conclude, that they can't by all the divine Grace afforded to them, come out of that State, and become ſincere Chriſtians. Which is a poor begging the Queſtion, and prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing as to the Point in Conteſt. You prove that wicked Men whilſt wicked, can do no good Works, whereas you ſhould prove, that wicked Men muſt remain wicked, and that all the Grace that GOD affords them while they are wicked is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to enable them to become ſincere. And for as much as you have not done this, though you have done much, yet have you done nothing to the Purpoſe. In a Word, thoſe Points which are in Conteſt, as whether Grace be irreſiſtable, whether ſufficient Grace be afforded to ſuch as never repent, whether GOD does all in our Converſion, theſe you take for granted: And a Point about which no Body doubts, you have prov'd moſt laboriouſly: this is the true Character of your Piece.</p>
            <p>As to your Diſcourſe of Original Sin, though I will not ſay as the Quaker did to <hi>Whitefield,</hi> that it is <hi>nothing but ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Non-ſenſe:</hi> yet I am ſure, I can't find the Senſe of a great Part of it. But it ſeems to be ſummed up in this Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Did GOD's Perfections <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> him to make Proviſion in our Caſe?</hi> P. 73. I ſuppoſe, you mean, was GOD obliged to ſend his Son into the World to redeem us, upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall? I anſwer, No. Had it not been for GOD's ſovereign Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his Threatning would have been put into Execution, <hi>In the Day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die:</hi> and then <hi>Adam</hi> would have had no Poſterity to ſuffer for his Sin. Your Diſcourſe therefore proceeds upon a Miſtake, viz. That if GOD had not ſeen fit to ſhew Mercy to Man after the Fall, yet our firſt Parents would have continued in this World, and have propagated their Kind; and we after Death ſhould have riſen to an immortal State in another World, i. e. to lie in the Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. Which Notion is not only without Foundation in holy Scripture, but is directly contrary to it. For the Death threatned to <hi>Adam</hi> was as GOD himſelf explained it <hi>to return to Duſt out of which he was taken,</hi> not to go to Hell.—Beſides, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture informs us, that had there been no Saviour provided, there would have been no Reſurrection. As <hi>by Man came Death, ſo by Man came the Reſurrection.</hi> And Chriſt ſays, <hi>I am the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and the Life.</hi> So that had not GOD provided a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy upon the Fall, we ſhould not have been liable to be damned for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, as the Devils were for their own. Which obſervation demoliſhes your Hypotheſis.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:006093_0020_102784189B6050E8"/>One thought more I would hint to you, and I have done, which is, that your great Labour in this Affair was perfectly needleſs: Becauſe you teach the ſame Doctrine that you write againſt. <q>You ſay, GOD has given great and precious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements for Sinners to Strive, and the more they Strive, the more Reaſon the Goſpel gives them, to hope for Salvation. Thus you begin: And in your Conluſion you tell us, it is your full Perſuaſion, that in the Day of Judgment, not one ſingle Soul will be found, who did his beſt Endeavour, and yet miſt of Salvation.</q> This is exactly our Opinion too. The worſt that we teach in this Affair is, that it is certain by GOD's Word, that no Sinner who does his beſt, ſhall miſs of Salvation, where then is the mighty Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which could juſtify you in accuſing us of holding <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Covenant, another Goſpel, of dangerous Errors, Hereſies, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagianiſm,</hi> and I know not what; When you yourſelf pretend to believe juſt the ſame Thing?—If you ſtill inſiſt upon it, that we do differ widely, becauſe we hold, that GOD has given a Promiſe to aſſiſt the weary and heavy laden Sinner in coming to Chriſt; while you believe he has only given <hi>great and precious Encouragements to do it,</hi> ſuch as never did, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will fail any who truſt to them; Still I ſay, here is no real Difference. For by theſe <hi>great Encouragements,</hi> you muſt mean GOD's having called and invited Sinners to accept of his Mercy, and commanded them to turn and live, &amp;c. And it is inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the Sincerity of our heavenly Father, to invite Men to accept of that which he never intends they ſhall have, or to command them to do, what he is not diſpoſed to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them to do. This I ſay, muſt be your Meaning. And this is all that we pretend to, ſo that in ſpight of all your Endeavours to differ and quarrel, you ſtill agree with us. And is it not unmanly and unchriſtian, to contend ſo fiercely, and clamor ſo loudly for a Word, and propagate a Spirit of Bitterneſs and Uncharitableneſs for only a Phraſe, when we are agreed in the Senſe? If you ſay, who began this ſilly Fray and Squabble about Words? I anſwer you with your Company, who made a Buſineſs thro' the Country to preach to ſerious People in the greateſt Diſtreſs to pleaſe GOD, and tell them, though they ſtrove and cried Day and Night for Mercy, yet there was but a <hi>meer Perhaps,</hi> and a meer MAY-BE for them. And when by this Craft you had driven a poor Soul into Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction then you boaſted, that you had got the Spirit to work in them; and inſulted over us, becauſe we had no ſuch
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006093_0021_1027841BACFC1530"/>
               <hi>Seals of our Miniſtry</hi> calling us <hi>Arminians, Phariſees,</hi> and <hi>almoſt</hi> an infinite Number of reproachful Epithets. And he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the moſt excellent Preacher who could hit upon the moſt extravagant and out of the Way Phraſe to reproach human Nature and Goſpel-Obedience with. I write no Calumny, but Facts to which there are Thouſands of Witneſſes. And yet if for this you don't call me a <hi>Blaſphemer,</hi> you have altered your Language.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding all this Load of Reproaches caſt upon us, yet whenever you are pleaſed to diſcourſe ſoberly, you make the Difference betwixt us and you, no greater than between <hi>great and precious Encouragements,</hi> which never did or will fail any, and Promiſes. And for my Part rather than contend for a Word, I will part with Promiſes, for ſuch <hi>great and precious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,</hi> if that will content you. For I am ſure, that a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of Honour, much more a GOD of Mercy and Truth, will no more fail or diſappoint a poor Beggar who truſts to his <hi>great Encouragements,</hi> than if he had had an expreſs Promiſe. The plain Truth is, that whatever Diſtance there is between you and us in this Point, there is the ſelf-ſame Diſtance and Diſagreement between you, and yourſelf. And if you ever are ſo happy as to agree with yourſelf, at the ſame Inſtant you will agree with us. But I never knew any one on your Side of the Queſtion, who did not pull down with one Hand, what he had built up with the other. This I confeſs is not peculiar to you, for I have heard that late eminent Writer Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> on your Side, affirm both in his Preaching and in private Converſation, That <hi>there is a Promiſe, or at leaſt equivalent to a Promiſe, that they who improve common Grace ſhall have ſpecial Grace.</hi> That theſe were his Words I can freely make Oath. And yet this ſame Gentleman has endeavoured to repreſent me as an Heretick, a Contradicter of Scripture, and all the Proteſtant Churches on Earth, for the ſame Doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But however you diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree among your ſelves, and even the ſame Man is at Variance with himſelf; and all the while ſure to be in the Right, yet there is one Thing you are all agreed in, and conſtant to, that is, to contradict, and reproach the Church of <hi>England:</hi> ſo <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> though at Enmity between themſelves, yet both agreed to ſet our bleſſed Saviour at Nought.</p>
            <p>Thus Sir, I have told you my Opinion of your Performance uprightly, and I think, without Reviling on the one Hand, or Flattery on the other. Treat me in the ſame frank and candid Manner; and it will be very agreeable to, Sir,</p>
