            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IN obedience to the order of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary <hi>15</hi>th, I have now the honor to incloſe you a <hi>REPORT</hi> on the ſubject of <hi>MEASURES, WEIGHTS,</hi> and <hi>COINS.</hi> The length of time which intervened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the date of the order and my arrival in this city, prevented my receiving it till the <hi>15</hi>th of April; and an illneſs which followed ſoon after, added, unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, ſome weeks to the delay; ſo that it was not till about the <hi>20</hi>th of May that I was able to finiſh the Report. A deſire to leſſen the number if its imperfections, induced me ſtill to withhold it awhile, till, on the <hi>15</hi>th of June, came to my hands, from Paris, a printed copy of a propoſition made by the Biſhop of <hi>AUTUN,</hi> to the National Aſſembly of France, on the ſubject of Weights and Meaſures; and three days afterwards I received through the channel of the public papers, the ſpeech of <hi>Sir JOHN RIGGS MILLER,</hi> of April <hi>13</hi>th, in the Britiſh Houſe of Commons, on the ſame ſubject. In the report which I had prepared, and was then about to give in, I had propoſed the latitude of <hi>38°,</hi> as that which ſhould fix our ſtandard, becauſe it was the medium latitude of the United States; but the propoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the National Aſſembly of France, to take that of <hi>45°</hi> as being a middle term between the Equator and both Poles, and a term which might conſequently unite the nations of both hemiſpheres, appeared to me ſo well choſen, and ſo juſt, that I did not heſitate a moment to prefer it to that of <hi>38°.</hi> It became neceſſary of courſe to reform all my calculations to that ſtandard; an operation which has been retarded by my other occupations.</p>
            <p>Theſe circumſtances will, I hope, apologize for the delay which has attended the execution of the order of the Houſe: And, perhaps, a diſpoſition on their part, to have due regard to the proceedings of other nations, engaged on the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, may induce them ſtill to defer deciding ultimately on it till their next ſeſſion. Should this be the caſe, and ſhould any new matter occur in the mean time, I ſhall think it my duty to communicate it to the Houſe, as ſupplemental to the preſent Report.</p>

            <head>The <hi>SECRETARY OF STATE,</hi> to whom was referred, by the <hi>HOUSE OF REPRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENTATIVES,</hi> to prepare and report a proper Plan or Plans for eſtabliſhing Uniformity in the <hi>CURRENCY, WEIGHTS</hi> and <hi>MEASURES</hi> of the United States, in obedience thereto, makes the following REPORT:</head>
            <p>TO obtain uniformity in Meaſures, Weights and Coins, it is neceſſary to find ſome meaſure of invariable length, with which, as a ſtandard, they may be compared.</p>
            <p>There exiſts not in nature as far as has been hitherto obſerved, a ſingle ſubject or ſpecies of ſubject, acceſſible to man, which preſents one conſtant and uniform dimenſion.</p>
            <p>The globe of the earth itſelf, indeed, might be conſidered as invariable in all its dimenſions, and that its circumference would furniſh an invariable meaſure; but no one of its circles, great or ſmall, is acceſſible to admeaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment through all its parts; and the various trials to meaſure definite portions of them, have been of ſuch various reſult, as to ſhew there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on that operation for certainty.</p>
            <p>MATTER then, by its mere extenſion, furniſhing nothing invariable, its MOTION is the only remaining reſource.</p>
            <p>The motion of the earth round its axis, though not abſolutely uniform and invariable, may be conſidered as ſuch for <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uman purpoſe. It is meaſured obviouſly, but unequally, by the departure of a given meridian from the ſun, and its return to it, conſtituting a ſolar day. Throwing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the inequalities of ſolar days, a mean interval, or day, has been found, and divided, by very general conſent, into 86,400 equal parts.</p>
            <p>A Pendulum, vibrating freely, in ſmall and equal area, may be ſo adjuſted in its length, as, by its vibrations, to make this diviſion of the earth's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into 86,400 equal parts, called ſeconds of mean time.</p>
            <p>Such a Pendulum then, becomes itſelf a meaſure of determinate length, to which all others may be referred, as to a ſtandard.</p>
            <p>But even the Pendulum is not without its uncertainties.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The difficulty of aſcertaining, in practice, its center of oſcillation, as depending on the form of the bob, and its diſtance from the point of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion; the effect of the weight of the ſuſpending wire towards diſplacing the center of oſcillation; that center being ſeated within the body of the bob, and therefore inacceſſible to the meaſure, are ſources of conſiderable uncertainty.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:022994_0005_0FBAD73675FAD900"/>2. Both theory and experience prove, that to preſerve its iſochroniſm, it muſt be ſhorter towards the equator, and longer towards the poles.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The height of the ſituation above the common level, as being an increment to the radius of the earth, diminiſhes the length of the Pendulum.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The pendulum being made of metal, as is beſt, it varies its length with the variations in the temperature of the atmoſphere.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To continue ſmall and equal vibrations, through a ſufficient length of time, and to count theſe vibrations, machinery and a power are neceſſary, which may exert a ſmall, but conſtant effort to renew the waſte of motion: And the difficulty is, ſo to apply theſe, as that they ſhall neither retard nor accelerate the vibrations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In order to avoid the uncertainties which reſpect the center of oſcilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it has been propoſed by Mr. Leſlie, an ingenious artiſt of Philadelphia, to ſubſtitute, for the pendulum, an uniform cylindrical rod, without a bob.</p>
            <p>Could the diameter of ſuch a rod be infinitely ſmall, the center of oſcilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be exactly at two thirds of the whole length, meaſured from the point of ſuſpenſion. Giving it a diameter which ſhall render it ſufficiently inflexible, the center will be diſplaced, indeed; but, in a ſecond rod not the (1.) 600,000th part of its length, and not the hundredth part as much as in a ſecond pendulum, with a ſpherical bob of proper diameter. This diſplacement is ſo infinitely minute then, that we may conſider the center of oſcillation, for all practical purpoſes, as reſiding at two thirds of the length, from the center of ſuſpenſion. The diſtance between theſe two cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters might be eaſily and accurately aſcertained in practice. But the whole rod is better for a ſtandard, than any portion of it, becauſe ſenſibly defined at both its extremities.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The uncertainty ariſing from the difference of length requiſite for the ſecond pendulum, or the ſecond rod, in different latitudes, may be avoided by fixing on ſome one latitude, to which our ſtandard ſhall refer. That of 38°, as being the middle latitude of the United States, might ſeem the moſt convenient, were we to conſider ourſelves alone; but connected with other nations by commerce and ſcience, it is better to fix on that parallel which bids faireſt to be adopted by them alſo. The 45th, as being the middle term between the equator and pole, has been heretofore propoſed in Europe; and the propoſition has been lately renewed there, under circumſtances which may very poſſibly give it ſome effect. This parallel is diſtinguiſhed with us alſo, as forming our principal northern boundary. Let the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of the 45th degree, then, give the ſtandard for our union, with the hope that it may become a line of union with the reſt of the world.</p>
            <p>The difference between the ſecond rod for 45° of latitude, and that for 31°, our other extreme, is to be examined.</p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>pendulum</hi> for 45° of latitude, according to Sir Iſaac Newton's computation, muſt be of (2.) 39.14912 inches Engliſh meaſure; and a <hi>rod,</hi> to vibrate in the ſame time, muſt be of the ſame length between the centers
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022994_0006_0FBAD738ABF9FEE0"/>
of ſuſpenſion and oſcillation, and conſequently its whole length 58.7 (or more exactly 58.72368) inches. This is longer than the rod which ſhall vibrate ſeconds in 31° of latitude, by about 1/670 part of its whole length; a difference ſo minute that it might be neglected, as inſenſible, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon purpoſes of life: But in caſes requiring perfect exactneſs, the ſecond rod, found by trial of its vibrations in any part of the United States, may be corrected by computation for the (3.) latitude of the place, and ſo brought exactly to the ſtandard of 45°.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By making the experiment in the level of the ocean, the difference will be avoided, which a higher poſition might occaſion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The expanſion and contraction of the rod with the change of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, is the fourth ſource of uncertainty before mentioned. According to the high authority ſo often quoted, an iron rod, of given length, may vary, between ſummer and winter, in temperate latitudes, and in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon expoſure of houſe clocks, from 1/1728 to 1/2592 of its whole length, which, in a rod of 58.7 inches, will be from about two to three hundredths of an inch. This may be avoided by adjuſting and preſerving the ſtandard in a cellar, or other place, the temperature of which never varies. Iron is named for this purpoſe, becauſe the leaſt expanſible of the metals.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The practical difficulty reſulting from the effect of the machinery and moving power, is very inconſiderable in the preſent ſtate of the arts; and, in their progreſs towards perfection, will become leſs and leſs. To eſtimate and obviate this, will be the artiſt's province. It is as nothing when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the ſources of inaccuracy hitherto attending meaſures.</p>
            <p>Before quitting the ſubject of the inconveniencies, ſome of which attend the pendulum alone, others both the pendulum and rod, it muſt be added that the rod would have an accidental, but very precious advantage over the pendulum in this country, in the event of our fixing the foot at the neareſt aliquot part of either; for the difference between the common foot and thoſe ſo to be deduced, would be three times greater in the caſe of the pendulum, than in that of the rod.</p>
            <p>Let the ſtandard of meaſure then be an uniform cylindrical rod of iron, of ſuch length, as, in latitude 45°, in the level of the ocean, and in a cellar, or other place, the temperature of which does not vary through the year, ſhall perform its vibrations, in ſmall and equal ares, in one ſecond of mean time.</p>
            <p>A ſtandard of invariable length being thus obtained, we may proceed to identify, by that, the Meaſures, Weights and Coins of the United States: But here a doubt preſents itſelf, as to the extent of the reformation meditated by the Houſe of Repreſentatives. The experiment made by Congreſs in the year one thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty-ſix, by declaring that there ſhould be one money of account and payment through the United States, and that its parts and multiples ſhould be in a decimal ratio, has obtained ſuch general approbation, both at home and abroad, that nothing ſeems wanting, but the actual coinage, to baniſh the diſcordant pounds, ſhillings, pence, and farthings of the different States, and ſo eſtabliſh in their ſtead,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022994_0007_0FBAD73A643B44C0"/>
the new denominations. Is it in contemplation with the Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives to extend a like improvement to our Meaſures and Weights, and to arrange them alſo in a decimal ratio? The facility which this would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce into the vulgar arithmetic, would, unqueſtionably, be ſoon and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly felt by the whole maſs of the people, who would thereby be enabled to compute for themſelves whatever they ſhould have occaſion to buy, to ſell, or m meaſure, which the preſent complicated and difficult ratios place beyond their computation, for the moſt part. Or, is it the opinion of the Repreſentatives that the difficulty of changing the eſtabliſhed habits of a whole nation oppoſes an inſuperable bar to this improvement? Under this uncertainty the Secretary of State thinks it his duty to ſubmit alternative plans, that the Houſe may, at their will, adopt either the one or the other, excluſively, or the one for the preſent, and the other for a future time, when the public mind may be ſuppoſed to have become familiarized to it.</p>

               <p>And firſt, on the ſuppoſition that the preſent Meaſures and Weights, are to be retained, but to be rendered uniform and invariable, by bringing them to the ſame invariable ſtandard.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſettlers of theſe States, having come chiefly from England, brought with them the Meaſures and Weights of that country.

We muſt reſort to that country for information of what they are, or ought to be.</p>
               <p>This reſts, principally, on the evidence of certain ſtandard Meaſures and Weights, which have been preſerved, of long time in different depoſits. But differences among theſe having been known to exiſt, the Houſe of Commons, in the years 1757 and 1758, appointed committees to inquire into the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſtandards of their weights and meaſures. Theſe committees, aſſiſted by able mathematicians and artiſts, examined and compared with each other the ſeveral ſtandard meaſures and weights, and made reports on them in the years 1758 and 1759. The circumſtances under which theſe reports were made, entitle them to be conſidered, as far as they go, as the beſt written teſtimony exiſting, of the ſtandard meaſures and weights of England; and as ſuch, they will be relied on in the progreſs of this report.</p>

                  <p>On this branch of their ſubject, the committee of 1757, 1758, ſays that the ſtandard meaſures of length at the receipt of the exchequer, are a yard, ſuppoſed to be of the time of H. 7. and a yard and ell ſuppoſed to have been made about the year 1601; that they are braſs rods very coarſely made,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022994_0008_0FBAD73D86272E18"/>
their diviſions not exact, and the rods bent: and that in the year 1742, ſome members of the Royal Society had been at great pains in taking an exact meaſure of theſe ſtandards, by very curious inſtruments, prepared by the ingenious Mr. Graham; that the Royal Society had had a braſs rod made purſuant to their experiments, which was made ſo accurately, and by perſons ſo ſkilful and exact, that it was thought not eaſy to obtain a more exact one; and the committee in fact found it to agree with the ſtandards at the exchequer, as near as it was poſſible. They furniſh no means, to perſons at a diſtance, of knowing what this ſtandard is. This, however, is ſupplied by the evidence of the ſecond pendulum, which, according to the authority before quoted, is, at London, 39.1682 Engliſh inches, and conſequently, the ſecond rod, there, is of 58.7523 of the ſame inches. When we ſhall have found, then, by actual trial, the ſecond rod for 45° by adding the difference of their computed length, to wit, 287/10000 of an inch, or rather 3/10 of a line (which in practice will endanger leſs error, than an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt at ſo minute a fraction as the ten thouſandth parts of an inch) we ſhall have the ſecond rod of London, or a true meaſure of 58 ¾ Engliſh inches.

                  <p>There are moreover, varieties on theſe varieties, from the barrel to the ton incluſive: for, if the barrel be of herrings, it muſt contain 28 gallons by the ſtatute 13.

Wincheſter buſhel, by the 11. H. 7. undefined; and the barrel of ale 32 gallons, and of beer 36 gallons, by the ſtatute 23. H. 8. c. 4.</p>
                  <p>The Secretary of State is not informed whether there have been any and what alterations of theſe meaſures, by the laws of the particular States.</p>
                  <p>It is propoſed to retain this ſeries of meaſures, but to fix the gallon to one determinate capacity, as the unit of meaſure, both wet and dry; for convenience is in ſavour of aboliſhing the diſtinction even between wet and dry meaſures.</p>
                  <p>The wine gallon, whether of 224 or 231 cubic inches, may be altogether diſregarded, as concerning, principally, the mercantile, and the wealthy, the leaſt numerous part of the ſociety, and the moſt capable of reducing one meaſure to another by calculation. This gallon is little uſed among the maſs of farmers, whoſe chief habits and intereſts are in the ſize of the corn buſhel.</p>
                  <p>Of the ſtandard meaſures before ſtated, two are principally diſtinguiſhed in authority and practice. The ſtatute buſhel of 2150 cubic inches, which gives a gallon of 268.75 cubic inches, and the ſtandard gallon of 1601, called the corn gallon of 271, or 272 cubic inches, which has introduced the mercantile buſhel of 2176 inches. The former of theſe is moſt uſed in ſome of the grain ſtates, the latter in others. The middle term of 270 cubic inches may be taken as a mutual compromiſe of convenience, and as offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this general advantage, that the buſhel being of 2160 cubic inches, is exactly a cubic foot and a quarter, and ſo facilitates the converſion of wet and dry meaſures into ſolid contents and tonnage, and ſimplifies the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of meaſures and weights, as will be ſhewn hereafter. It may be added in favour of this, as a medium meaſure, that eight of the ſtandard or ſtatute meaſures before enumerated, are below this term, and nine above it.</p>
                  <p>The meaſures to be made for uſe, being four-ſided, with rectangular ſides and bottom:

                  <p>Cylindrical meaſures have the advantage of ſuperior ſtrength: but ſquare ones have the greater advantage of enabling every one, who has a rule in his pocket, to verify their contents, by meaſuring them.

                  <p>So that the pound Troy contains 5760 grains, of which 7,000 are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to make the pound Avoirdupois; of courſe the weight of the pound Troy, is to that of the pound Avoirdupois, as 5760 to 7,000, or, as 144 to 175.</p>
                  <p>It is remarkable that this is exactly the proportion of the ancient liquid gallon of Guildhall of 224 cubic inches, to the corn gallon of 272; for 224 are to 272, as 144 to 175. (4.)</p>
                  <p>It is further remarkable ſtill, that this is alſo the exact proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſpecific weight of any meaſure of wheat, and of the ſame meaſure of water. For the ſtatute buſhel is of 64 pounds of wheat. Now as 144 to 175, ſo are 64<abbr>lb.</abbr> to 77.7<abbr>lb.</abbr> but 77.7<abbr>lb.</abbr> is known to be the weight of (5.) 2150.4 cubic inches of pure water; which is exactly the content of the Wincheſter buſhel, as declared by the ſtatute 13.14.

                  <p>We find then in a continued proportion 64 to 77.7 as 224 to 272, and as 144 to 175, that is to ſay, the ſpecific weight of a meaſure of wheat, to that of the ſame meaſure of water, as the cubic contents of the wet-gallon, to thoſe of the dry; and as the weight of a pound Troy to that of a pound Avoirdupois.</p>
                  <p>This ſeems to have been ſo combined as to render it indifferent whether a thing were dealt out by weight or meaſure, for the dry gallon of wheat, and the liquid one of wine were of the ſame weight; and the Avoirdupois pound of wheat, and the Troy pound of wine, were of the ſame meaſure. Water and the vinous liquors, which enter moſt into commerce, are ſo nearly of a weight, that the difference, in moderate quantities, would be neglected by both buyer and ſeller; ſome of the wines being a little heavier, and ſome a little lighter than water.</p>
                  <p>Another remarkable correſpondence, is, that between weights and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. For 1000 ounces avoirdupois of pure water, fill a cubic foot, with mathematical exactneſs.</p>
                  <p>What circumſtances of the times or purpoſes of barter, or commerce, called for this combination of weights and meaſures, with the ſubjects to be exchanged or purchaſed, are not now to be aſcertained. But a triple ſet of exact proportionals repreſenting weights, meaſures, and the things to be weighed and meaſured, and a relation ſo integral between weights and ſolid meaſures, muſt have been the reſult of deſign and ſcientific calculation, and not a mere coincidence of hazard. It proves that the dry, and wet meaſures, the heavy and light weights, muſt have been original parts of the ſyſtem they compoſe: Contrary to the opinion of the committee of 1757—1758, who thought that the avoirdupois weight was not an ancient weight of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, nor ever even a legal weight, but during a ſingle year of the reign of H. 8. and therefore, concluded, otherwiſe than will be here propoſed, to ſuppreſs it altogether. Their opinion was founded chiefly on the ſilence of the laws, as to this weight. But the harmony here developed in the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of weights and meaſures, of which the avoirdupois makes an eſſential member, corroborated by a general uſe, from very high antiquity, of that, or of a nearly ſimilar weight under another (6.) name, ſeem ſtronger proofs that this is a legal weight, than the mere ſilence of the written laws is of the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Be this as it may, it is in ſuch general uſe with us, that, on the principle of popular convenience, it's higher denominations, at leaſt, muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. It is by the avoirdupois pound and ounce that our citizens have been uſed to buy and ſell. But the ſmaller ſubdiviſions of drams and quarters, are not in uſe with them. On the other hand, they have been uſed to weigh their money and medicine with the penny-weights and grains troy-weight, and are not in the habit of uſing the pounds and ounces of that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. It would be for their convenience, then, to ſuppreſs the pound and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022994_0013_0FBAD7456A01A1B0"/>
ounce troy, and the dram and quarter avoirdupois; and to form into one ſeries the avoirdupois pound and ounce, and the troy penny-weight and grain. The avoirdupois ounce contains 18 penny-weight 5 ½ grains troy-weight. Divide it then into<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18 penny-weight, and the penny-weight, as heretofore, into 24 grains, and the new penny-weight will contain between a third and a quarter of a grain more than the preſent troy penny-weight; or, more accurately, it will be to that, as 875 to 864, a difference not to be noticed, either in money or medicine, below the denomination of an ounce.</p>
                  <p>But it will be neceſſary to refer theſe weights to a determinate maſs of ſome ſubſtance, the ſpecific gravity of which is invariable. Rain-water is ſuch a ſubſtance, and may be referred to every where, and through all time. It has been found by accurate experiments, that a cubic foot of rain-water weighs 1000 ounces Avoirdupois, ſtandard weights of the Exchequer. It is true that among theſe ſtandard weights, the committee reports ſmall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations; but this experiment muſt decide in favour of thoſe particular weights, between which and an integral maſs of water, ſo remarkable a coincidence has been found. To render this ſtandard more exact, the water ſhould be weighed always in the ſame temperature of air, as heat, by increaſing it's volume, leſſens it's ſpecific gravity. The cellar of uniform temperature, is beſt for this alſo.</p>
                  <p>Let it, then, be eſtabliſhed that an ounce is of the weight of a cube of rain-water, of one tenth of a foot, or rather, that it is the thouſandth part of the weight of a cubic foot of rain-water, weighed in the ſtandard tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature: that the ſeries of weights of the United States ſhall conſiſt of pounds, ounces, penny-weights, and grains; whereof

It is to preſerve the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of doing this, that this very minute alteration is propoſed.</p>
                  <p>We have this proportion then, 875 to 864 as 376.02985 grains troy to 371.30261, the expreſſion of the unit in the new grains.</p>

                  <p>If nothing more then, is propoſed than to render uniform and ſtable the ſyſtem we already poſſeſs, this may be effected on the plan herein detailed; the ſum of which is, 1.

That the quantity of pure ſilver in the money unit be expreſſed in parts of the weights ſo defined.</p>
                  <p>In the whole of this no change is propoſed, except an inſenſible one in the troy grain and penny-weight, and the very minute one in the money unit.</p>
