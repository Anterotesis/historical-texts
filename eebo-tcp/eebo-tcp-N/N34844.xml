            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I SHALL conclude our courſe of lectures, by delivering to you a few directions for the regulation of your future conduct and ſtudies, in the line of your profeſſion.</p>
            <p>I ſhall, <hi>firſt,</hi> ſuggeſt the moſt probable means of eſtabliſhing yourſelves in buſineſs, and of becoming acceptable to your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and reſpectable in life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> I ſhall mention a few thoughts which have occurred to me on the mode to be purſued, in the further proſecution of your ſtudies, and for the improvement of medicine.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Permit me, in the firſt place, to recommend to ſuch of you as intend to ſettle in the country, to eſtabliſh yourſelves as early as poſſible upon <hi>farms.</hi> My reaſons for this advice are as follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It will reconcile the country people to the liberality and dignity of your profeſſion, by ſhewing them that you aſſume no ſuperiority over them from your education, and that you intend to ſhare with them in thoſe toils, which were impoſed upon man in conſequence of the loſs of his innocence. This will prevent envy, and render you acceptable to your patients as men, as well as phyſicians.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By living on a farm you may ſerve your country by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting improvements in agriculture. Chemiſtry (which is now an important branch of a medical education) and agriculture are cloſely allied to each other. Hence ſome of the moſt uſeful books upon agriculture have been written by phyſicians. Witneſs the eſſays of Dr. Home of Edinburgh, and of Dr. Hunter of York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire in England.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The buſineſs of a farm will furniſh you with employment in the healthy ſeaſons of the year, and thereby deliver you from the taedium vitae, or what is worſe, from retreating to low or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per company. Perhaps one cauſe of the prevalence of dram or grog drinking, with which country practitioners are ſo generally charged, is owing to their having no regular or profitable buſineſs to employ them in the intervals of their attendance upon their patients.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:045581_0003_102047015E6F3E98"/>4. The reſources of a farm will create ſuch an independence as will enable you to practice with more dignity, and at the ſame time ſcreen you from the trouble of performing unneceſſary ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to your patients. It will change the nature of the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between you and them. While <hi>money</hi> is the only means of your ſubſiſtence, your patients will feel that they are the channels of your daily bread; but while your farm furniſhes you with the neceſſaries of life, your patients will feel more ſenſibly, that the obligation is on their ſide, for health and life.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The exigencies and wants of a farm, in <hi>ſtock</hi> and <hi>labor</hi> of all kinds, will enable you to obtain from your patients a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for your ſervices in thoſe articles. They all poſſeſs them, and men part with that of which money is only the ſign, much more readily than they do with money itſelf.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The reſources of a farm will prevent your cheriſhing, for a moment, an impious wiſh for the prevalence of ſickneſs in your neighbourhood. A healthy ſeaſon will enable you to add to the produce of your farm, while the rewards of an unhealthy ſeaſon will enable you to repair the inconvenience of your neceſſary ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from it. By theſe means your purſuits will be marked by that <hi>variety</hi> and <hi>integrity,</hi> in which true happineſs is ſaid to conſiſt.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Let your farms be ſmall, and let your <hi>principal</hi> attention be directed to graſs and horticulture. Theſe afford moſt amuſement, require only moderate labor, and will interfere leaſt with your duties to your profeſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Avoid ſingularities of every kind in your manners, dreſs, and general conduct. Sir Iſaac Newton, it is ſaid, could not be diſtinguiſhed in company, by any peculiarity, from a common well-bred gentleman. Singularity in any thing, is a ſubſtitute for ſuch great or uſeful qualities as command reſpect; and hence we find it chiefly in little minds. The profane and indelicate combination of extravagant ideas, improperly called wit, and the formal and pompous manner, whether accompanied by a wig, a cane, or a ring, ſhould all be avoided, as incompatible with the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of ſcience and the real dignity of phyſic. There is more than one way of playing the quack. It is not neceſſary, for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that a man ſhould advertiſe his ſkill, or his cures, or that he ſhould mount a phaeton and diſplay his dexterity in operating to an ignorant and gaping multitude. A phyſician acts the ſame part in a different way, who aſſumes the character of a madman or a brute in his manners, or who conceals his fallibility by an affected gravity and taciturnity in his intercourſe with his patients. Both characters, like the quack, impoſe upon the public. It is true,
<pb n="5"
                   facs="unknown:045581_0004_10204702F6C06B20"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
they deceive different ranks of people; but, we muſt remember that there are two kinds of vulgar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viz. the rich and the poor; and that the rich vulgar are often below the poor, in ignorance and credulity.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It has been objected to our profeſſion, that many eminent phyſicians have been unfriendly to chriſtianity. If this be true, I cannot help aſcribing it in part to that neglect of public worſhip with which the duties of our profeſſion are often incompatible; for it has been juſtly obſerved, that the neglect of this religious and ſocial duty, generally produces a relaxation, either in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or morals. Let this fact lead you, in ſetting out in buſineſs, to acquire ſuch habits of punctuality in viſiting your patients, as ſhall not interfere with acts of public homage to the Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Dr. Gregory has obſerved, that a cold heart is the moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent cauſe of deiſm. Where this occurs in a phyſician, it affords a preſumption that he is deficient in humanity. But I cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that infidelity is peculiar to our profeſſion. On the contrary, I believe chriſtianity places among its friends more men of exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive abilities and learning than any other ſecular employment. Stahl, Hoffman, Boerhaave, Sydenham, Haller and Fothergill were all chriſtians. Theſe enlightened phyſicians were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the ornaments of the ages in which they lived, and poſterity has juſtly ranked them among the greateſt benefactors of mankind.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Permit me to recommend to you a regard to all the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of your country. The education of a phyſician gives him a peculiar inſight into the principles of many uſeful arts, and the practice of phyſic favours his opportunities of doing good, by diffuſing knowledge of all kinds. It was in Rome, when medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine was practiſed only by ſlaves, that phyſicians were condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their profeſſion "mutam exercere artem." But in modern times, and in free governments, they ſhould diſclaim an ignoble ſilence upon public ſubjects. The hiſtory of the American revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution has reſcued phyſic from its former ſlaviſh rank in ſociety. For the honor of our profeſſion it ſhould be recorded, that ſome of the moſt intelligent and uſeful characters, both in the cabinet and the field during the late war, have been phyſicians. The il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Dr. Fothergill oppoſed faction and tyranny, and took the lead in all public improvements in his native country, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuffering thereby the leaſt diminution of that reputation, or buſineſs, in which, for forty years, he flouriſhed almoſt without a rival in the city of London.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Let me adviſe you, in your viſits to the ſick, <hi>never</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in a hurry, nor to talk of indifferent matters before you have
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:045581_0005_10204705733446C0"/>
made the neceſſary inquiries into the ſymptoms of your patient's diſeaſe.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Avoid making light of any caſe. "Reſpice finem" ſhould be the motto of every indiſpoſition. There is ſcarcely a diſorder ſo trifling, that has not, directly, or indirectly, proved an outlet to human life. This conſideration ſhould make you anxious and punctual in your attendance upon every acute diſeaſe, and keep you from riſking your reputation by an improper or haſty prognoſis.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Do not condemn, or oppoſe, unneceſſarily, the ſimple pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of your patients. Yield to them in matters of little conſequence, but maintain an inflexible authority over them in matters that are eſſential to life.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Preſerve, upon all occaſions, a compoſed or cheerful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance in the room of your patients, and inſpire as much hope of a recovery as you can, conſiſtent with truth, eſpecially in acute diſeaſes. The extent of the influence of the will over the human body, has not yet been fully aſcertained. I reject the futile pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of Mr. Meſmer to the cure of diſeaſes, by what he has abſurdly called animal magnetiſm. But I am willing to derive the ſame advantages from his deceptions, which the chemiſts have derived from the deluſions of the alchemiſts. The facts which he has eſtabliſhed, clearly prove the influence of the imagination and will upon diſeaſes. Let us avail ourſelves of the handle which theſe powers of the mind preſent to us, in the ſtrife between life and death. I have frequently preſcribed remedies of doubtful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy in the critical ſtage of acute diſeaſes, but never till I had worked up my patients into a confidence, bordering upon certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of their probable good effects. The ſucceſs of this meaſure has much oftener anſwered, than diſappointed my expectations; and while my patients have commended the vomit, the purge, or the bliſter which was preſcribed, I have been diſpoſed to attribute their recovery to the vigorous concurrence of the <hi>will</hi> in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the medicine. Does the will beget inſenſibility to cold, heat, hunger, and danger? Does it ſuſpend pain, and raiſe the body above feeling the pangs of Indian tortures? Let us not then be ſurpriſed that it ſhould enable the ſyſtem to reſolve a ſpaſm, to open an obſtruction, or to diſcharge an offending humor. I have only time to hint at this ſubject. Perhaps it would lead us, if we could trace it fully, to ſome very important diſcoveries in the cure of diſeaſes.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Permit me to adviſe you to attend to that principle in the human mind, which conſtitutes the aſſociation of ideas,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:045581_0006_1020470751222778"/>
in your intercourſe with your patients. A chamber, a chair, a curtain, or even a cup, all belong to the means of life or death, accordingly as they are aſſociated with cheerful or diſtreſſing ideas, in the mind of a patient. But this principle is of more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate application in thoſe chronic diſeaſes which affect the mind. Nothing can be accompliſhed here, till we produce a new aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of ideas. For this purpoſe, a change of place and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany are abſolutely neceſſary. But we muſt ſometimes proceed much further. I have heard of a gentleman in South-Carolina who cured his fits of low ſpirits by changing his clothes. The remedy was a rational one. It produced at once a new train of ideas, and thus removed the paroxyſm of his diſeaſe.</p>
            <p n="10">X. Make it a rule never to be angry at any thing a ſick man ſays or does to you. Sickneſs often adds to the natural irritability of the temper. We are, therefore, to bear the reproaches of our patients with meekneſs and ſilence. It is folly to reſent injuries at any time, but it is cowardice to reſent an injury from a ſick man; ſince, from his weakneſs and dependence upon us, he is unable to contend with us upon equal terms. You will find it difficult to attach your patients to you by the obligation of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or gratitude. You will ſometimes have the mortification of being deſerted by thoſe patients who owe moſt to your ſkill and humanity. This led Dr. Turner to adviſe phyſicians never to chuſe their friends from among their patients. But this advice can never be followed by a heart that has been taught to love true excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, where ever it finds it. I would rather adviſe you to give the benevolent feelings of your hearts full ſcope, and to forget the unkind returns they will often meet with, by giving to human nature—a tear.—</p>
            <p n="11">XI. Avoid giving a patient over in an acute diſeaſe. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to tell in ſuch caſes where life ends, and where death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins. Hundreds of patients have recovered, who have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced incurable, to the great diſgrace of our profeſſion. I know that the practice of predicting danger and death upon every occaſion, is ſometimes made uſe of by phyſicians, in order to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance the credit of their preſcriptions if their patients recover, and to ſecure a retreat from blame, if they ſhould die. But this mode of acting is mean and illiberal. It is not neceſſary that we ſhould decide with confidence at any time, upon the iſſue of a diſeaſe.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. I ſhall now give ſome directions with reſpect to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of charging for your ſervices to your patients.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:045581_0007_10204708DEAF3D68"/>When we conſider the expence of a medical education, and the ſacrifices a phyſician is obliged to make of eaſe, ſociety, and even health, to his profeſſion; and when we add to theſe, the conſtant and painful anxiety which is connected with the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant charge of the lives of our fellow-creatures, and above all, the ineſtimable value of that bleſſing which is the object of his ſervices, I hardly know how it is poſſible for a patient ſufficiently and juſtly to reward his phyſician. But when we conſider, on the other hand, that ſickneſs deprives men of the means of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring money; that it increaſes all the expences of living; and that high charges often drive patients from regular-bred phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to quacks; I ſay, when we attend to theſe conſiderations, we ſhould make our charges as moderate as poſſible, and conform them to the following ſtate of things.</p>
            <p>Avoid meaſuring your ſervices to your patients by ſcruples drachms, and ounces. It is an illiberal mode of charging. On the contrary, let the number and the <hi>time</hi> of your viſits, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of your patient's diſeaſe, and his rank in his family or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, determine the figures in your accounts. It is certainly juſt to charge more for curing an apoplexy, than an intermitting fever. It is equally juſt, to demand more for riſking your life by viſiting a patient in a contagious fever, than for curing a pleuriſy. You have a right likewiſe to be paid for your anxiety. Charge the ſame ſervices, therefore, higher to the maſter or miſtreſs of a family, or to an only ſon or daughter, who call forth all your feelings and induſtry, than to leſs important members of a family and of ſociety. If a rich man demands more frequent viſits than are neceſſary, and if he impoſes the reſtraints of keeping to hours by calling in other phyſicians to conſult with you upon every trifling occaſion, it will be juſt to make him pay accordingly for it. As this mode of charging is ſtrictly agreeable to reaſon and equity, it ſeldom fails of according with the reaſon and ſenſe of equity of our patients. Accounts made out upon theſe principles, are ſeldom complained of by them. I ſhall only remark further upon this ſubject, that the ſooner you ſend in your accounts after your patients recover, the better. It is the duty of a phyſician to inform his patient of the amount of his obligation to him at leaſt <hi>once</hi> a year. But there are times when a departure from this rule may be neceſſary. An unexpected misfortune in buſineſs, and a variety of other accidents, may deprive a patient of the money he had allotted to pay his phyſician. In this caſe, delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and humanity require, that he ſhould not know the amount of his debt to his phyſician, till time had bettered his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:045581_0008_1020470A97B90368"/>I ſhall only add, under this head, that the poor of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription ſhould be the objects of your peculiar care. Dr. Boer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haave uſed to ſay,
<q>they were his beſt patients, becauſe God was their paymaſter.</q>
The firſt phyſicians that I have known, have found the poor the ſteps by which they have aſcended to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and reputation. Diſeaſes among the lower claſs of people are generally ſimple, and exhibit to a phyſician the beſt caſes of all epidemics, which cannot fail of adding to his ability of curing the complicated diſeaſes of the rich and intemperate. There is an inſeparable connection between a man's duty and his intereſt. Whenever you are called, therefore, to viſit a poor pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, imagine you hear the voice of the good Samaritan ſounding in your ears,
<q>Take care of him, and I will repay thee.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I COME now to the ſecond part of this addreſs, which was to point out the beſt mode to be purſued, in the further proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your ſtudies, and the improvement of medicine.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Give me leave to recommend to you, to open all the dead bodies you can, without doing violence to the feelings of your patients, or the prejudices of the common people. Preſerve a regiſter of the weather, and of its influence upon the vegetable productions of the year. Above all, record the epidemics of every ſeaſon; their times of appearing, and diſappearing, and the connection of the weather with each of them. Such records, if publiſhed, will be uſeful to foreigners, and a treaſure to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity. Preſerve, likewiſe, an account of chronic caſes. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord the name, age and occupation of your patient; deſcribe his diſeaſe accurately, and the changes produced in it by your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies; mention the doſes of every medicine you adminiſter to him. It is impoſſible to tell how much improvement and facility in practice you will find from following theſe directions. It has been remarked, that phyſicians ſeldom remember more than the two or three laſt years of their practice. The records which have been mentioned, will ſupply this deficiency of memory, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that advanced ſtage of life when the advice of phyſicians is ſuppoſed to be moſt valuable.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Permit me to recommend to you further, the ſtudy of the anatomy (if I may be allowed the expreſſion) of the human mind, commonly called metaphyſics. The reciprocal influence of the body and mind upon each other, can only be aſcertained by an accurate knowledge of the faculties of the mind, and of their various modes of combination and action. It is the duty of phyſicians to aſſert their prerogative, and to reſcue the mental ſcience from the uſurpations of ſchoolmen and divines. It can
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:045581_0009_1020470F2F735E90"/>
only be perfected by the aid and diſcoveries of medicine. The authors I would recommend to you upon metaphyſics, are, Butler, Locke, Hartly, Reid, and Beattie. Theſe ingenious writers have cleared this ſublime ſcience of its technical rubbiſh, and rendered it both intelligible and uſeful.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Let me remind you, that improvement in medicine is not to be derived only from colleges and univerſities. Syſtems of phyſic are the productions of men of genius and learning; but thoſe facts which conſtitute real knowledge, are to be met with in every walk of life. Remember how many of our moſt uſeful remedies have been diſcovered by quacks. Do not be afraid, therefore, of converſing with them, and of profiting by their ignorance and temerity in the practice of phyſic. Medicine has its Phariſees, as well as religion. But the ſpirit of this ſect is as unfriendly to the advancement of medicine, as it is to chriſtian charity. By converſing with quacks, we may convey inſtruction to them, and thereby leſſen the miſchief they might otherwiſe do to ſociety. But further.—In the purſuit of medical knowledge, let me adviſe you to converſe with nurſes and old women. They will often ſuggeſt facts in the hiſtory and cure of diſeaſes which have eſcaped the moſt ſagacious obſervers of nature. Even ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes and Indians have ſometimes ſtumbled upon diſcoveries in medicine. Be not aſhamed to inquire into them. There is yet one more ſource of information in medicine which ſhould not be neglected, and that is, to converſe with perſons who have reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from indiſpoſitions without the aid of phyſicians. Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſtrength and exertions of nature in theſe caſes, and mark the plain and home-made remedy to which they aſcribe their recovery. I have found this to be a fruitful ſource of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and have been led to conclude, that if every man in a city, or a diſtrict, could be called upon to relate to perſons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to receive and publiſh his narrative, an exact account of the effects of thoſe remedies which accident or whim has ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, it would furniſh a very uſeful book in medicine. To preſerve the facts thus obtained, let me adviſe you to record them in a book to be kept for that purpoſe: it may be called a <hi>quack recipe-book.</hi> There is one more advantage that will probably attend the inquiries that have been mentioned; you may diſcover diſeaſes, or ſymptoms of diſeaſes, or even laws of the animal oeconomy, which have no place in our ſyſtems of noſology, or in our theories of phyſic.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Let me recommend to your particular attention, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digenous medicines of our country. Cultivate or prepare as many of them as poſſible, and endeavour to enlarge the materia medica, by exploring the untrodden fields and foreſts of the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:045581_0010_10204711087150E0"/>
United States. The ipecacuana, the Seneka and Virginia ſnake roots, the Carolina pink-root, the ſpice-wood, the ſaſſafras, the butter-nut, the thoroughwort, the poke, and the ſtrammonium, are but a ſmall part of the medical productions of America. I have no doubt but there are many hundred other plants which now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale invaluable medical virtues in the deſert air. Examine, likewiſe, the mineral waters, which are ſo various in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnation, and ſo common in all parts of our country. Let not the properties of the inſects of America eſcape your inveſtigation. We have already diſcovered among ſome of them, a fly equal in its bliſtering qualities to the famous fly of Spain. Who knows but it may be reſerved for America to furniſh the world, from her productions, with cures for ſome of thoſe diſeaſes which now elude the power of medicine? Who knows but what, at the foot of the Allegany mountain there blooms a flower that is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible cure for the epilepſy? Perhaps on the Monongahela, or the Potowmac, there may grow a root that ſhall ſupply, by its tonic powers, the invigorating effects of the ſavage or military life in the cure of conſumptions. Human miſery of every kind is evidently on the decline. Happineſs, like truth, is an unit. While the world, from the progreſs of intellectual, moral and political truth, is becoming a more ſafe and agreeable abode for man, the votaries of medicine ſhould not be idle. All the doors and windows of the temple of nature have been thrown open by the convulſions of the late American revolution. This is the time, therefore, to preſs upon her altars. We have already drawn from them diſcoveries in morals, philoſophy, and government; all of which have human happineſs for their objects. Let us preſerve the unity of truth and happineſs, by drawing from the ſame ſource, in the preſent critical moment, a knowledge of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes to thoſe diſeaſes which are ſuppoſed to be incurable.</p>
            <p>I have now, Gentlemen, only to thank you for the attention with which you have honoured the courſe of lectures which has been delivered to you, and to aſſure you, that I ſhall be happy in rendering you all the ſervices that lie in my power, in any way you are pleaſed to command me. Accept of my beſt wiſhes for your happineſs, and may the bleſſings of hundreds and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands that were ready to periſh, be your portion in life, your comfort in death, and your reward in the world to come.</p>
