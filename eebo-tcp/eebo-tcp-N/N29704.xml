            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wherefore <hi>Heaven</hi> is called <hi>the Promise</hi>: Heb. 10.36. <hi>That you may inherit the Promise.</hi> They that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit Heaven, inherit the Promise.

This <hi>Solomon</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in the Prayer which he made at the Dedication of the Temple; 1 King. 8.23, 24. <hi>Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee; who keepest Covenant &amp; Mercy with thy Servants that walk before thee with all their heart; who hast kept with thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> David <hi>my Father that thou promisedst him; thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand.</hi> And all that God promised concerning the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> he made good: Ver. 56. <hi>Blessed be the Lord, that has given rest to his People</hi> Israel, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all that he promised; there has not failed one word of all his good promise.</hi> We may then be assured, that whereas God has promised to give his Saints an everlasting Rest in the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> he will not fail to do it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Jesus Christ has purchased this Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance</hi> for his Saints They have a right unto it, not only by vertue of a <hi>Promise</hi>; but of a blessed <hi>Purchase.</hi> It is a <hi>Purchased Possession,</hi> Eph. 1.14<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Christ has bought his People with a valuable price: 1 Cor. 7.23.

                  <hi>You are bought with a Price.</hi> And when he bought them, he bought heaven for them too. The heavenly Inheritance is infinitely more Valuable than any earthly Inheritance; nevertheless, Christ has given as much for the purchasing of it as it is worth; Namely, his own precious Life &amp; Blood. Believers are bought, &amp; Heaven is bought for them; <hi>not with silver &amp; gold, but with the precious Blood of Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.19. Silver and Gold will purchase an Earthly Inheritance; but the Heavenly Inheritance is infinitely more Valuable than all the Silver and Gold in the world: But the precious Blood of Christ is of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue sufficient to Purchase it. No meer Man or Creature, did ever Merit any thing at the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nds of God; much less so great a Good as the Glory of heaven: But Christ has done it with the price of his infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meritorious Blood. Believers may from the consideration of the infinite Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of that Blood, have an humble holy Confidence, of their entring into heaven: Heb. 10.19. <hi>Having boldness to enter into the Holiest by the Blood of Jesus.</hi> It is not
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:039533_0009_10142B4FBB7027F0"/>
to be imagined, that Christ has Died in Vain. The Apostle says, <hi>If Righteousness came by the Law, then Christ is Dead in Vain,</hi> Gal. 1.21. So if Believers should not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the heavenly Inheritance, then Christ has Died and shed his precious Blood in Vain.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Heaven is come down into the Souls of those who are indeed Saints of God.</hi> Where there is real Sanctity, heaven is come into the Soul: Heb. 3.1. <hi>Holy Brethren, parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Heavenly Calling.</hi> Men are apt to think, that the happiness of heaven does consist in a perfect freedom from all affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Evils, and in blessed Delights; and so it does in part, but <hi>more in Holiness.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in holiness is the glory of heaven. Tis said, <hi>We are Chosen that we should be Holy,</hi> Eph. 1.4. We are Chosen that we should be happy; to be holy is to be happy. A sanctified man has an <hi>Heaven-born soul</hi>: He is born <hi>from above</hi>; that is from <hi>Heaven.</hi> True saving Grace is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life and Glory in the beginnings of it. It is called <hi>the first fruits,</hi> Rom. 8.23. The first fruits were but an handful; yet a
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:039533_0010_10142B515FD70FE0"/>
pledge of a plentiful crop. So is Grace in the soul, of an harvest of Glory. Hence also, Grace is called <hi>the Earnest of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,</hi> Eph. 1.14. When men are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing an Inheritance, if they give an <hi>Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Peny,</hi> that assures the Inheritance to them. Thus when the holy Spirit begins a work of Grace in the soul of the Believer, that assures him, that the heavenly Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance shall be given to him.</p>

Children are not always <hi>Heirs</hi>; but A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted Children are. Believers if they are (as they are) God's Adopted <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then Heirs; Heirs of God, and Joynt-Heirs with Christ,</hi> Rom. 8.17.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>If it were not for this Heavenly Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Believers would be the most Misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men in the world.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.19. <hi>If in this Life only we have Hope in Christ, we are of all men the most miserable.</hi> For often it is so; that Ungodly men Prosper in the world: They have a brave time of it here; Riches, and Honours, and Earthly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, more than heart could wish. When at the same time, the Saints and Servants of God are Exposed to all manner of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series; and this it may be too for their Godliness. <hi>For thy sake we are Killed all the Day long!</hi> Therefore we may be assured that they shall be Happy in another world for ever; and that will more than compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sate for all their Afflictions in this world. We may from such Providences conclude, that most certainly that there is both an Heaven and an Hell. Since Wicked men have their <hi>Good things in their Life time</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:039533_0011_10142B5450624E30"/>
here, we may be assured that there is a Life to come in which they shall receive Evil. It was well replied by a Christian Emperor, when some informed him that an Old Noble man above Ninety Years was newly Dead; and that he had been one of the Wickedest men that ever lived, and yet never met with any considerable Affliction throughout the whole course of his Life; then (said the Emperor) we may conclude that Divines tell us the Truth, when they say that there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World besides this wherein we now Live. Wicked <hi>Dives</hi> Lived at heart-ease, faring Deliciously every day; but when Dead, and his Soul gone into Eternity, he Cries out, <hi>I am in a place of Torment.</hi> So when we see Holy men, and it may be such as have done great Service for God, under sore Afflictions and Temptations, we may rest satisfied, that there is an Heaven in which they shall be Comforted. It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Light of Natural Reason, to imagine that Vertuous and Godly men shall be more Miserable than the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edst of men. Yet so it must be, if there

There are Three Expressions in the Text before us, by which the Happiness of Saints in the Heavenly World is denoted.</p>

Eccl. 1.2. Some of the richest men in this world, have been the most miserable men when they have gone out of the world.

to the Earth, which make it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable to Earthly men: There are hidden <hi>Treasures</hi> in it, with which God fills the Bellies of some men, who have their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Life.

The <hi>Souls</hi> in heaven swim in holy Pleasures, and they are <hi>Perpetual,</hi> like a River that keeps running from age to age. There are Honours to be enjoyed on the Earth; but not Everlasting Honours. Death will soon put an end to all worldly Grandieur. But Heavenly Glory will last to Eternity, as hereafter we shall shew. This Earth it self is but like a Stage, which is set up but for a while, and then it must be pulled down. The <hi>Scheme,</hi> the <hi>Fashion of this
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:039533_0016_10142B5FC08CB388"/>
world passeth away,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.31. After it has continued a few Thousands of Years, it must be taken down; nay, burnt up. All the Rich and Glorious Cities on the Earth must be destroyed, but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is a City which shall stand to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. It is a City that has <hi>Foundations.</hi> All the Houses on the Earth shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed with Fire at the latter day: 2 Pet. 3.10. <hi>The Elements shall melt with fervent heat; the Earth also &amp; the works which are therein shall be burnt up.</hi> But Heaven is an Eternal House. These things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that there is no comparison between Earthly and Heavenly happiness.</p>
               <p>Let us compare the Sufferings of God's Children, whilst they are on the Earth, with the Glory which they shall have in Heaven: Rom. 8.18. <hi>I reckon that the sufferings of this present time, are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us.</hi> That Glory does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably Out-ballance all their Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Put their present Afflictions into One Scale, and their future Glory into the Other Scale, and the weight of Glory
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:039533_0017_10142B61AA7A4868"/>
Out-weighs Wonderfully. The weight of Glory does exceed by far and far, the heaviest Affliction that ever any Saint of God was subject unto in this world; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him to have been as grievously Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted as <hi>Job</hi> was, who Complains that if his Grief were throughly weighed, and his Calamity laid in the balances together, it would be <hi>Heavier than the sand of the Sea.</hi> All these Afflictions are as light as a Feather, compared with the <hi>Weight of Glory in Heaven.</hi> Sometimes One Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will Weigh down all the Good and Comfort of this World. If a man is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a Tormenting Disease, he would willingly part with all his Estate, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from that Misery: But the Glory of Heaven Out-balances all. There is no more comparison between them, than there is between a few Sands &amp; a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If we consider whose <hi>Inheritance</hi> this is, we must conclude that it is a Rich and Glorious One. It is <hi>Gods Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance:</hi> The Riches of the Glory of <hi>His</hi> Inheritance. It is said to be <hi>His,</hi>

Because He is the Bestower of it: Tis his glorious Gift; Psal. 84.11. <hi>He giveth Glory.</hi> If he gives Glory, He will give like himself. It is reported concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great King, that when he bestowed an Extraordinary Bounty, the Receiver said the Gift was <hi>too great</hi>; he had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served so much: That Liberal King repli'd, <hi>If it is too much for you to receive, it is not too much for me to give.</hi> The greatest <hi>Riches of Glory</hi> is not <hi>too great</hi> for God to give: He has infinite Riches: Enough to make Millions of needy Creatures exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rich: <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.19. <hi>God shall supply all your need, according to his Riches in Glory.</hi> He has not Only Glory , but Riches of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: He can make Thousands of Millions of poor Creatures Vastly rich. Can we think, that the <hi>Great</hi> GOD will bestow a <hi>Small Patrimony</hi> on his Children? Most certainly, the Adopted Children of God will be the Richest Heirs in the world. Believers are <hi>Heirs of God, and Joynt-heirs with Christ,</hi> Rom. 8.17. Parents bestow Inheritances or Portions on their Children, according to what Estate they have: They
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:039533_0018_10142B66A5C22EF8"/>
that are Vastly Rich, will give Portions accordingly. What a Rich and Glorious Inheritance then will the Infinite GOD bestow on every Child of his?</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) This Inheritance is said to be <hi>His,</hi> because it is his Propriety and Possession. That cannot but be a Rich and Glorious Inheritance, which is God's own Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: This is true concerning that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven which his Saints shall Inherit. An Acute and Worthy Divine Observes, that <hi>David</hi> does by this, prove that they who Fear the Lord are the happiest men in the world; Psal. 115.15, 16. <hi>You are bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of the Lord, which made Heaven and Earth: The Heaven, even the Heavens are the Lords; but the Earth hath he given to the Children of men.</hi> As for the Earth, he gives that to the Sons of men: Let them take it says the Lord, I give it to them; it shall be their Inheritance. But that is not an Inheritance good enough for GOD. No: The Heaven of Heavens is <hi>His:</hi> Therefore how happy must his Saints be, when he will take them up to that Heaven which he has reserved for himself?</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:039533_0018_10142B66A5C22EF8"/>5. If we consider the Properties of this happiness, which the Saints of God shall enjoy in the heavenly World, we shall see that it is wonderfully great.</p>
               <p>For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) It will Continue for ever &amp; ever. This is implied when it is called an <hi>Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</hi> Saints in heaven are not like <hi>Tenants</hi> at will; but they are <hi>Heirs.</hi> When an Inheritance is made over to a man, it useth to be <hi>to him and to his heirs for ever.</hi> The Inheritance of heaven is by the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Deed that possibly can be, made over to Christ and to his Heirs for ever; Rom. 8.17. <hi>Joint-heirs with Christ.</hi> Other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances are but Temporal: This is an <hi>Eternal Inheritance,</hi> Heb. 9.15. Other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances may Corrupt; but this is an <hi>Inheritance Incorruptible,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4. In this World men may have their Riches taken from them, by One means or other; but <hi>Heavenly Treasures</hi> can never be lost. An Eminent Christian when he was at a Feast, would sometimes say; <hi>Here is good Company, and so there is in Heaven; here is a Feast, &amp; so there is in Heaven:
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:039533_0019_10142B6954ABEE60"/>
but here is</hi> Taking away; <hi>whenas there is none of that in Heaven.</hi> They that chuse Heaven for their Portion, shall not have it taken from them. <hi>David</hi> was much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Mercy of God, in that he had not only given him a Kingdom; but had promised that it should be Established in his Family for a Long time to come. <hi>This</hi> (said he) <hi>was a small thing in thy sight.</hi> Did he think, the bestowing of a Kingdom on him was a small thing? No: It was a great thing: But the continuance of it in his Family for a long time, made it a much greater Mercy. Saints in Heaven enjoy a Kingdom, <hi>not for a long time only</hi>; but beyond all time throughout eternal ages. <hi>An entrance is ministred to them abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord &amp; Saviour Jesus Christ,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.11. If a man should enjoy the Blessedness of the Heavenly World, if it were but for One Day, that would be a greater happiness than for him to enjoy all the Consolations which earth can afford for Thousands of Years; but what then is it to enjoy that Blessedness throughout the never ending Days of Eternity?</p>

                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:039533_0019_10142B6954ABEE60"/>(2.) Another property of this Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, is, that it admits of no Interruption, no Intermission. It is a Spring Tide that has no Ebb; a Summer that has no Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; a Day that has no Night following it; <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.25. The Gates shall not at all be shut, <hi>for there shall be no Night there.</hi> There have been Saints on earth, who have sometimes had a great Intimacy of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God; and then they have thought how Happy should they be, if it might be always thus: Oh! it was good to be here. But, alas! This Heaven upon Earth was soon interrupted. Soul Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing Joy, has been as that Ancient said; <hi>Rara hota et brevis mora:</hi> A rare hour and of short stay. Old <hi>Bernards</hi> Companion being filled with Joy, said; <hi>He hoped he should never be Sad more as long as he Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</hi> His Joy was soon gone, and then he <hi>feared he should never have Comfort any more; but be Disconsolate all his Days.</hi> But Saints in Heaven have Joy without any intermission: <hi>Pleasures for evermore.</hi> The Consolation of Heaven is an <hi>Everlasting Consolation.</hi> The Tree of Life is said to
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:039533_0020_101416EFB89A7A80"/>
yield its Fruit every <hi>Month</hi>; intimating the uninterruptedness of the Delights of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Another property of this Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, is, that it is not subject to any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Tis called <hi>an Inheritance that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not away</hi>; and <hi>a Crown of Glory that Fadeth not.</hi> Things in this World which have a singular Beauty and Glory in them, quickly Fade and Wither. Tis said of the Lily, that <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his glory was not arrayed like unto it: But it soon wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Heavens Glory does not so. Here men are taken with a pleasant Object for a while; but when they are used to it; they <hi>Loose</hi> their Esteem of it. In heaven nothing Withers; nothing grows Old and Stale.

Indeed all True Believers are <hi>Equally Justified</hi>; because the Righteousness of CHRIST is imputed <hi>to</hi> the <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Believer</hi> as well as <hi>to the Strongest</hi>: but they are <hi>not</hi> all <hi>Equally Sanctified.</hi> Some are far <hi>more Holy</hi> and <hi>Mortified</hi> Christians than Others are. Now if GOD bestows a greater measure of Grace <hi>on some</hi> of his Servants in this <hi>World,</hi> there is reason to believe that they shall have a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <hi>of Glory</hi> in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are <hi>Some</hi> who have done far greater Service <hi>for God,</hi> and have <hi>been more</hi> Active <hi>Instruments</hi> in Glorifying his <hi>Name than Others</hi> have. <hi>Paul</hi> could say, <hi>I have Laboured more abundantly than they all,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. Will not that <hi>more</hi> abundant <hi>Labour,</hi> have a <hi>more</hi> abundant
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:039533_0021_10142B6E82613508"/>
                  <hi>Reward</hi>? Has not Christ Promised that it shall? Rev. 22.12. <hi>Behold I come, and my Reward is with me; to give every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as his Work shall be</hi>: Both accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Quality</hi> of his Works, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Quantity</hi> of them. It is therefore said, that <hi>he which soweth sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, shall reap sparingly: and he which soweth bountifully, shall reap bountifully,</hi> 2 Cor. 9 6. There are some who have greater <hi>Talents</hi> committed to them than others Ever had; and they have faithfully improved them to the Honour of the God and Giver of them: He will then honour them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. One has two Talents, another has five: One is made Ruler over five Cities, another over ten. The holy Prophets did Eminent Service for God, in bearing a Faithful Testimony against the Sins of the time: Wherefore a greater Reward will in the Day of <hi>Retribution</hi> be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed to them than to other Servants of the Lord. The <hi>Reward of a Prophet</hi> is distinguished from the Reward of one who is only a <hi>Righteous man,</hi> Mat. 10.41. Some have been Instruments of Converting ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:039533_0022_10142B70B2CA2AB0"/>
Sinners; and so of Saving many Souls from Death. There is a singular degree of Glory reserved for such in the heavenly World: Dan. 12.3. <hi>They that turn many to Righteousness, shall shine as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi> The Apostle said to the <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonians,</hi> that they would be <hi>his Crown &amp; his Glory</hi> at the Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Their having been the Seals of his Ministry, would add Glory to his Crown at the Last Day, and in Heaven for ever, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.19, 20. Can we think, that every Saint shall have as great a Crown of Glory as <hi>Paul</hi> shall in that Day?</p>
               <p n="3">3 Some Saints have been greater Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers for Christ than others have. If we Suffer with him, we shall Reign with him. And when we Reign with him, the greater our Sufferings have been for his sake, the greater will our Crown then be. An Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror once gave a Chain of Gold as big as those Chains of Iron which a faithful Servant of his, had been laid in, when Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned for Fidelity to his Interest. But what will Christ then give to those who
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:039533_0022_10142B70B2CA2AB0"/>
have Suffered Persecutions &amp; Reproaches for their Fidelity to his Interest? Blessed are they, for <hi>Great shall be their Reward in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 5.13, 14 The belief of this, was One thing which made Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the Primitive Times, very desirous to Dy for the Name of Christ. They were perswaded that <hi>Martyrs</hi> would have <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olae</hi>; peculiar Crowns of Glory given to them. They in a peculiar manner glorify God. It was said of <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>by his Death he should Glorify God,</hi> Joh. 21.19. He died a Martyr: Was Crucified the same day that <hi>Paul</hi> was Beheaded, as the Martyrologists inform us. If they Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify God and Christ above Others, will not a singular Crown of Glory be given to them?</p>

The Glory of the Saints will then be as Visible as the Sun in the Firmament, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.43.

               <p>This should put us upon <hi>Examining</hi> our Title to this Glorious Inheritance.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Are we <hi>Saints</hi>? The Riches of the Glory of his Inheritance <hi>in the Saints,</hi> says the Text. Except we are Saints, we are not fit for this Inheritance, nor does it belong to us: Col. 1.12. <hi>Giving thanks to the Father, who has made us meet to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> If it were possible for an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man to get to <hi>Heaven,</hi> he would
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:039533_0024_10142B77B5254920"/>
not find it a place <hi>Meet</hi> for him. It is a most Holy place. What should an Unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sinner do there? He would find nothing there of that which his sinful Soul does most of all delight in. He would find no Company there suitable for him. <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> do not Love the Company of <hi>Saints:</hi> They cannot say as <hi>David</hi> does, <hi>All my Delight is with the Saints on Earth.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times if an Holy man comes into the <hi>room</hi> where there is a <hi>Company</hi> of Vain persons, they will withdraw presently: The very Presence of an holy man Damps them, and spoils their Mirth. What then would they do in Heaven, where there are none but Saints; and such too as are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sanctified? Say then, Are we Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? If truly so, then Heaven is Our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance: Act. 20.32. <hi>To give you an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance among all them that are Sanctified.</hi> Are our Hearts Holy? Do our Hearts within us desire much Holiness, rather than much of the things of this World? If GOD should put it to our <hi>Choice,</hi> would our hearts chuse rather to be Holy than to be Rich and Great in the World? That's
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:039533_0025_10142B7A3A3E7238"/>
a sign that we are bound for Heaven, and that our Souls shall be there when we leave this World: Psal. 24 3,4. <hi>Who shall ascend into the Hill of the Lord? And who shall stand in his Holy place? He that has clean Hands, and a pure Heart!</hi> Do we Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to perfect <hi>Holiness</hi> in the Fear of God, and to purify our selves as He is pure? Then may we hope that we have a right to this Inheritance, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. What are our Lives and Conversations, are they holy and heavenly? Do we drive an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Trade continually: Phil. 3.20. <hi>Our Conversation is in heaven.</hi> Our Trading is there, says the Apostle. Every Saint of God has the Priviledge of Trading there: He sends Ventures to heaven, and has rich Returns. To be much in Prayer and Praises, is to drive an Heavenly Trade.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Is Christ ours?

            <p>THE Design of the Apostle in the Context before us, is, to Excite Believers unto Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: This is urged from the Consideration of those great Priviledges which they are the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of.

Obedience and Holiness. Believers under the New Testament are Priviledged above those of the Old Testament: They are under a more Gracious dispensation. The Gospel state of the Church is far more Excellent &amp; Desirable than the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal state was. That which remains is far more Glorious: Therefore a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of holiness is required and expected from those who are concerned in it. This, with the preceding and following Verse contains the Priviledges which Believers receive by the Gospel. We have therein a description of <hi>the true Catholick Church.</hi> The Catholick Church comprehending all God's Elect and Called Ones, is distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into two Parts; Viz. That which is <hi>Militant,</hi> and that which is <hi>Triumphant.</hi> The Apostle speaks of Both.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He asserts that Believers are <hi>come to Mount Sion; the City of the Living God, the Heavenly Jerusalem.</hi> By <hi>Sion,</hi> we are not to understand the Literal <hi>Sion</hi>; but the <hi>Church of God,</hi> of which <hi>Sion</hi> was a Figure. As for the Literal <hi>Sion,</hi> it had two heads; On One of which the Temple was Built,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:039533_0028_10142B82491F57A8"/>

            <p n="5">5. Believers are come to the <hi>Spirits of Just Men made Perfect.</hi> They are the words before us to insist on. Believers on Earth are come to the Saints in Heaven, in respect of Faith, and Hope, and Love. They are incorporated into the same Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: They are united by the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Saints on Earth are partakers of the same Holy Spirit, which possesseth Saints in Heaven, altho' not in the like degree and measure. And they are as sure to be with them in the heavenly World, in a little time as if they were there already. Yea, in respect of Christ their Head they are there. By <hi>the Spirits</hi> of Just men, their <hi>never Dying Souls</hi> are meant. Every man does consist of two essential Parts, a Soul and a Body: The first man that ever was made did so: And all other men do so. <hi>The Soul</hi> is often in the Scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Spirit</hi>: Especially the Soul in a state of separation from the Body: For
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:039533_0031_10142B88DF2CD1D8"/>
when the Soul is Unbodied, it is a pure <hi>Spirit,</hi> like the <hi>Angels</hi> who are called <hi>Spirits.</hi> The <hi>Perfection</hi> here spoken of, is only a Perfection of the Soul. Just men are not wholly Perfected before the Last Day. Their Bodies are not Perfected until the Resurrection; but their Souls are Perfected as soon as they leave their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and go to the Heavenly World.</p>
            <p>The DOCTRINE to be insisted on, is;
<q>That there is a Blessed Perfection which the Souls of Just Men attain unto, when their Bodies are Dead.</q>

                  <hi>True Believers on Jesus Christ are Just Men.</hi> There are but two sorts of men in the World; the <hi>Just,</hi> and the <hi>Unjust:</hi> So does the Scripture distinguish, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.15 The whole World is divided into these two.

Gal. 2.16. <hi>Knowing that a man is not justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Works of the Law, but by Faith in Jesus Christ; that we might be justified by the Faith of Christ, &amp; not by the Works of the Law: for by the Works of the Law, shall no Flesh living be justified.</hi> Wherefore no Soul of man had ever been among the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Company of Angels, or in the Heavenly Jerusalem, if it had not been for

their own.

               <p n="3">(3.) Just men while their Spirits abide in Flesh, meet with many Afflictions from the holy Providence of God. In Love &amp; Faithfulness He Orders Afflictions for them: Prov. 3.12. <hi>For whom the Lord Loveth, he Correcteth, ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> as a Father the Son, in whom he Delighteth.</hi> They many times meet with sad Disappointments, which prove a sore Affliction to them. But when once their souls are in Heaven, they will meet with no Disappointments there; unless it be, that they will find Heaven to be a far happier place than Ever they could imagine. Here they meet with Losses which afflicts them: It may be with Losses in their Estates; as <hi>Job</hi> a <hi>just man,</hi> lost all: A Vastly Rich man, and suddenly as Poor as <hi>Job.</hi> But when once they are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they shall have a better and greater Estate, than ever any man in this world had; and never loose any part of it: Heb<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:039533_0040_10142BA2E98F1578"/>
10.34 <hi>You took joyfully the spoiling of your Goods, knowing in your selves, that ye have in Heaven a better &amp; an enduring Substance.</hi> In this world, they are Afflicted with the Loss of Friends, of near and dear Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; it may be of Children, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proves a very bitter heart-piercing Affliction. <hi>In</hi> Rama <hi>was there a Voice heard, Lamentation, and Weeping, &amp; great Mourning;</hi> Rachel <hi>Weeping for her Children, and would not be Comforted, because they are not,</hi> Mat. 2.18. In Heaven there are none of these Losses. There Friends never part. In this world, they are sometimes Afflicted with Bodily Infirmities and Pains: But in the Heavenly World there shall be no more Death, nor Crying, <hi>neither shall there be any more Pain,</hi> Rev. 21.4. In this world the Lord's Servants may be subject unto Divine Desertions: GOD hides his Face from them, and that proves a Soul-wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Affliction. <hi>Heman</hi> complains, that his soul was full of trouble; that the Lord had cast off his soul, and hid his Face from him; and that he suffered the Terrors of God almost to Distraction. The Church
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:039533_0040_10142BA2E98F1578"/>
complains, that the Comforter which should relieve her Soul, was far from her. There are none of these Complaints in Heaven. The blessed Souls there, have the Face of GOD always shining upon them. Then and there the truth of that Scripture will be seen; Isa. 54.8. <hi>In a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Wrath I hid my Face from thee, for a Moment; but with Everlasting Kindness will I have Mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</hi> Thus shall the Righteous be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally Delivered out of all their Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But the Spirits of Just men when separated from their Bodies, enjoy a far more <hi>Perfect Happiness</hi> than this, of being Delivered from all Afflictive Evils.</p>
               <p>For,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They are Perfectly freed from Sin.</hi> Rom. 6.7. <hi>For he that is Dead, is freed from Sin.</hi> The Believer whose Heart is Sanctified &amp; Sin Mortified in him, is now <hi>freed from Sin</hi> as to the <hi>Dominion</hi> of it; but when his Body is Dead, he is perfectly freed from Sin as to the <hi>Being</hi> of it: unto which the Apostle in those words has respect: When once their Souls are in Heaven, before the

Throne of God there, they are Sinless &amp; Faultless: Rev. 14.5. <hi>They are without Fault before the Throne of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) They are perfectly delivered from Original Sin, That which the Scripture calls the <hi>Sin that dwells in us</hi>; under which holy men Mourn as long as they continue in this world: Rom. 7.24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, Who shall deliver me from the Body of this Death?</hi> One of the Ancients fitly compares indwelling sin to Ivy in the Wall of an House. Others have as fitly compared it to the Leprosy in the House of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> which must be pulled down before it could be perfectly cleansed and cleared of that woful Evil, <hi>Lev.</hi> 13.45. A man becomes a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creature, as soon as there is an Union between his soul and his body; and the <hi>just man</hi> ceaseth to be a sinner, when that Union is dissolved. When he giveth up the ghost, indwelling sin giveth up the ghost with him. The habit of sin is wholly Eradicated out of his soul. The disposi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>tion to sin is then perfectly abolished: Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

root and seed of sin has no more an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence in his soul. There is no more in him any inclination to that which is Evil, or any indisposition to that which is Good.</p>
               <p>Hence,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) There is a perfect blessed freedom from all Actual Sin. When once the Just mans Soul is in Heaven, he shall never sin more, in Word Thought or Deed; never have one Vain Thought in his mind, nor speak one Unprofitable Word throughout the Days of Eternity. The Just mans spirit when separated from his body, is in a place where there never was any Sin: For there never was any Sin in Heaven, which is therefore called an <hi>Inheritance Undefiled.</hi> If sin had been committed there, it would have defiled Heaven, as it did Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise. And there never shall be sin there. <hi>There shall in no wise enter into it any thing that Defileth,</hi> Rev. 21 27. On Earth there is not a man wholly free from sin: Eccl. 7.20. <hi>There is not a just man on Earth, that doeth good, &amp; sinneth not.</hi> But in Heaven there are Just men who never sin: and none
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:039533_0042_10142BA7360ADAA8"/>
but such are there. In Heaven they are in the immediate presence of GOD, and are always sensible that they are so; and therefore they sin not. When their Souls are <hi>absent from the Body,</hi> they are <hi>present with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.8. The Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ receives their Souls, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents them to God. Wherefore Dying <hi>Stephen</hi> said, <hi>Lord Jesus receive my spirit,</hi> Act. 7.59. Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> speaks of an holy man, who when Dying Express'd himself after this manner, <hi>Notwithstanding I am assur'd that God Loves me, and will receive my Soul; nevertheless, I should be afraid to appear before so Glorious a Presence, did I not know that Christ is in Heaven to present me to Him.</hi> Therefore the Souls of Just men when <hi>Separated</hi> from their Bodies are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less: For Christ will present them as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sin to his Father: Jude 24 <hi>He is able to present you faultless before the presence of his Glory.</hi> Moreover, there is in the hearts of some holy men, an earnest desire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of this, and to go to the Heavenly world, for this Reason Especially; that they may be perfectly freed from Sin. The
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:039533_0042_10142BA7360ADAA8"/>
holy Spirit of GOD has wrought this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in their hearts. He would not put such longings into their souls, if he did not intend to give them their desire. Some may be ready to say, <hi>But how is it possible that a Soul which has so much sin in it, should be made perfectly pure from sin in a moment of time</hi>? To this that answer may be given, which the Angel gave to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>; when she was astonished at the wonderful thing God would do for her, and said, <hi>How can this be</hi>? The Angel said, <hi>To God nothing is unpossible.</hi> GOD is able to cause such a wonderful Change in the Soul to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished in One Day, in One Moment. GOD who Converts a Soul from a state of sin in a moment; who turns a Sinner into a Saint in a moment, as he has often done, can make a <hi>Sinful</hi> Soul to become a <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> Soul in a moment. And the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of what shall be done to the Saints, whom Christ shall find alive on the Earth when he shall come to Judge the World at the Last Day, may Confirm our Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this also. Their Bodies &amp; their Souls too will be wonderfully Changed in
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:039533_0043_10142BAA7B1C6688"/>
a moment. Just before the Last Trumpet shall sound, they will have <hi>Souls</hi> &amp; <hi>Bodies</hi> subject to Sin: but as soon as the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet is heard sounding, they are made Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in a moment. <hi>Behold, I shew you a Mystery; We shall not all Sleep, but we shall all be Changed, in a moment, in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an eye, at the last Trump, (for the Trumpet shall sound, and the Dead shall be raised Incorruptible, &amp; we shall be Changed,)</hi> 1 Cor. 15.51, 52. And thus it was with <hi>Enoch,</hi> &amp; <hi>Elijah,</hi> when they were Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated: Before their Translation they were subject to sin; but in a moment perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly freed from sin. Why then should it not be so with the Souls of Just men, when they are Translated from Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? But this shall be further Confirmed and Cleared in the next <hi>Proposition.</hi>
               </p>

the Body, that Ignorance &amp; Darkness Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth away.

What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Wounds are given to the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Fall, are perfectly Cured in Heaven.

finished, <hi>Philippians</hi> 1.6. The habit of Grace which was wrought in the Soul by Regeneration, does not Dy with the Body; but goes with the Soul to Heaven &amp; into Eternity. Grace is a Seed of God which remains; an Anointing which abides in the soul. Death is so far from divesting the soul of its Graces, as that it perfects in a moment what was defective in them. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in Grace is the desire of every Godly man in this world; but the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of none. Tis Heavens attainment. Believers whilst in this world, are partly spiritual and partly carnal; partly holy &amp; partly sinful: There is flesh and spirit in a continual Combat: But in Heaven all is spiritual, all is holy. The Will of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd soul is perfectly Conformed to the will of God. <hi>Thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven;</hi> So we are to Pray, and the Expression does imply, that among the Saints in Heaven, there is a perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Will of GOD.

<pb n="83" facs="unknown:039533_0046_10142BB1B25A4A10"/>
regular in them: Glorify'd souls desire nothing, delight in nothing but what they should desire and delight in. There is no disorder in their Affections; they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver out of frame, as too often they are in this world. But Especially, that chief Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Love is <hi>Perfectly</hi> Sanctify'd: There is no defect in it; 1 Joh. 4.18. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Love casts out Fear.</hi> Tis so in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The spirits of Just men there, are made perfect in Love. There is no Fear there, but all is Love. Glorify'd souls are always in a flame of Love to God &amp; to Jesus Christ. In Heaven that great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is fulfill'd, &amp; that perfectly. The great Commandment is, <hi>Thou shalt Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</hi> In Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven they do so. And as their Love to God, so their Love to one another is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. In Heaven there is Light, and there is Love in the perfection of both. In this world, the best and most holy Servants of Christ, in some lesser points differ in their Judgments, and sometimes in their Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions too. <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas,</hi> altho' A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,

                  </gap>is said of those holy Souls, those <hi>Spirits of Just men,</hi> that <hi>white Robes were given to every one of them.</hi> Ver. 11. White Robes are an Ensign of Glory. The glorious Angels of Heaven, would sometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in <hi>white Robes</hi>; and the Spirits of Just men made perfect are like Angels; and therefore they must be represented as having <hi>white Robes</hi> on them. Moreover, the words allude to the Priests their being admitted into the Temple, who when they were first bro't into the inner Court, had white Robes put upon them. Thus the Souls of Just men when they first enter into the Heavenly Sanctuary, have <hi>white Robes</hi> given to them; they are immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cloathed with Glory.

are the Dead which Dy in the Lord, from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist has caused the Professors of the true Gospel, to be put to Cruel Deaths: Burning is such a Death. There is a Law in <hi>Antichrists Kingdom,</hi> that Hereticks (which is the Name they give to the Professors of the true Religion) shall be Burnt to Death. Now to encourage the Martyrs, the Spirit says, <hi>Blessed are the Dead which Dy in the Lord.</hi> You may suffer a painful Death, yet be of good Comfort, as soon as ever you are Dead you shall be Blessed. Says the Spirit, when a Righteous man Dies, his Soul is among the Spirits of Just men made perfect in Heaven, hefore his Body is laid in the Grave. Isa. 57.1, 2. <hi>The Righteous is taken away from the Evil to come; he shall enter into Peace, they shall rest in their Beds, i. e.</hi> in their Graves. It is in respect of their Souls that they <hi>enter into Peace</hi>; which imports their being in bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Tranquility, and this as soon as ever they are taken away out of this world, before their Bodies are laid to rest &amp; sleep in the Grave. Let us consider a little a
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:039533_0049_10142BBA70ADB738"/>
Promise which God made to <hi>Abraham</hi>; Gen. 15.15. <hi>Thou shalt go to thy Fathers in Peace; thou shalt be buried in a good Old Age.</hi> That word <hi>Going</hi> to Fathers, is Emphatical; and has respect to the <hi>Soul.</hi> It is true, that that Expression of <hi>Sleeping</hi> with Fathers, is sometimes used in the Scripture to denote no more than <hi>Dying</hi>; it has respect to the <hi>Body,</hi> whose Death is a Sleep: But that great Divine, whom we have diverse times taken notice of, has Judiciously Observed, that <hi>Going</hi> to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers implies more, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Soul goes to that World where Fathers are gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. When <hi>Abraham</hi> Dy'd, in respect of his Soul he went to <hi>Abel,</hi> and to <hi>Noah,</hi> &amp; to <hi>Shem,</hi> and to other of his Fore-fathers, who were gone into the Heavenly World before him, where the Spirits of those Just men were made Perfect. Before his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial could be accomplished, his Soul was gone and got among the immortal Spirits of his Fathers. Let us observe further what is said of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 25.8, 9. Where we see that Promise made to him fulfilled; <hi>Abraham gave up the Ghost, and
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:039533_0050_10142BECA7555218"/>
Died in a good Old Age; and was gathered to his People, and his Sons Buried him.</hi> As soon as he <hi>gave up the Ghost,</hi> that is resigned his Spirit unto God, he was <hi>gathered to his People.</hi> That Expression implies, that there were a Company gone before him, and <hi>Gathered</hi> together; and that <hi>Abraham</hi> instantly at his Death was Gathered with them. <hi>Gathering</hi> implies <hi>Sorting:</hi> As long as they are in this world, <hi>Good</hi> &amp; <hi>Bad</hi> are mixed together; not Only in the same <hi>Countrey,</hi> but the <hi>Wheat</hi> and the <hi>Tares</hi> grow together in the same <hi>Field</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>: But at Death all the <hi>Good</hi> are <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered</hi> into the Heavenly <hi>Garner,</hi> Mat. 3.12. And there they are kept safe by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; not so much as One Ungodly Soul with them. Observe three particulars in what is said of <hi>Abraham</hi> (1.) That he gave up the Ghost. (2) That he was Gathered to his People. (3.) That he was Buried. The two first were before the last. The like is said of <hi>Jacob;</hi> Gen. 49 33. <hi>He yielded up the Ghost,</hi> and <hi>was Gathered to his People.</hi> This was some time before his Burial. If it be asked,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:039533_0050_10142BECA7555218"/>
                  <hi>By whom are the Spirits of Just men Gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their People</hi>? Answ. It is by the holy Angels of Heaven. As at the Last Day, they shall <hi>Gather</hi> all the Elect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and bring them to Christ; Mat. 24.31. <hi>He shall send his Angels, and they shall gather together his Elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</hi> So the Angels Gather the Souls of Just men, and bring them to Christ in Heaven. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are always near unto them; but Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in their Dying hours. Their <hi>Souls</hi> must pass thro' their <hi>Enemies Countrey.</hi> The Air is the <hi>Devils Territory.</hi> The Lord will send a Convoy <hi>of Angels</hi> to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct their departing Souls; they will fly with them to the <hi>Regions</hi> of Bliss and Glory. When <hi>Elijah</hi> was translated, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were sent to fetch him to Heaven, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.11. So it is when the Souls of Just men are Translated from <hi>Earth</hi> to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Famous Mr. <hi>Holland's</hi> last words were, <hi>Thou fiery Chariot that camest Down to fetch</hi> Elijah, <hi>carry me to my happy Hold.</hi> This honour have all the Saints: Yea, the meanest of them. When <hi>Lazarus</hi> Dy'd,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:039533_0051_101416F60C32AA58"/>
                  <hi>he was carried by the Angels into Abrahams bosom,</hi> Luk. 16.22. <hi>Lazarus</hi> a poor man, yet in what State is he Conducted to Heaven? Angels were sent to fetch him thither. Thus we see, that the immortal Spirits of Just men are <hi>Immediately</hi> Blessed when separated from their Bodies. The Martyrs of JESUS have Dy'd in the Faith of this Truth; and have Rejoyced in the Meditation of it. The Martyr <hi>Bradford</hi> said to his Fellow-Martyr, <hi>Be of good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Brother; for we shall have a merry Supper with the Lord this Night.</hi> Mr. <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ehart</hi> a Famous Martyr in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few hours before his Death, said, <hi>Some have Reported that I believ'd, that the Souls of men Sleep with their Bodies; I am far from being of that Opinion: I certainly know, that I shall be with Christ this very Night.</hi> Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> when he came within two Miles of <hi>Hadley,</hi> where he was to be Martyr'd, <hi>Now</hi> (said he) <hi>I lack but two Miles, and I am at my Father's House.</hi> Mr. <hi>Sanders,</hi> Kissing the Stake said, <hi>Welcome the Cross of Christ; Welcome Everlasting Life.</hi> Dr. <hi>Juels</hi> Dying

               <p>We proceed to some APPLICATION of the DOCTRINE. There are several <hi>Inferences</hi> from the Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>th which has been Explain'd and Confirm'd.</p>
               <p>Inf. I. <hi>Christians ought not to Mourn Immoderately, for the Death of their Godly Friends.</hi> The Consideration of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Happiness, should Moderate our Griefs. When their Bodies are Dead; if they Dy in the Lord, their Spirits, their Souls are safe and happy. A man who has an Entire Love for another, will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at his Friends gain; altho' he should himself lose something by it. It is a Loss to us, when any of our Precious Praying Friends are taken from us by Death: But they are happy Gainers, &amp; that Meditation should quiet us. <hi>For me to Dy is Gain,</hi> said the Apostle. Should we not Rejoyce at our Friends Gain? Especially if they have gained a great Good; if they have gained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> Crown, and a Crown of Life too? This Consideration Christ set before his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,

to Comfort and Compose their spirits, which were much Troubl'd and Dejected at the thoughts of his Leaving them; Joh. 14.28. <hi>If you Loved me, ye would Rejoyce, because I go to the Father.</hi> So if our Friends and dear Relations who are gone from us, are gone to the Father and to Christ, at that we should Rejoyce. The Death of Children is a sore Affliction, and if they Dy in their Sins, without any signs of Repentance, that aggravates the Bitterness. This made <hi>David</hi> take on so, when <hi>Absalom</hi> was Dead: He was much mov'd, and went into his Chamber and Wept; and thus he said, <hi>O my Son</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salom, <hi>my Son, my Son</hi> Absalom: <hi>would GOD I had Dy'd for thee, O</hi> Absalom <hi>my Son, my Son,</hi> 2 Sam. 18.33. Q D. If I had Dy'd, I had gone to Heaven; but now thou art Dead in thy Sin and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion against GOD, and against thy Father; I have no hope but thou art gone to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Torments. But when there is good ground to believe, that they are gone to the Heavenly World, that marvellously alleviates the Affliction. As we see al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

in <hi>David</hi>; when his Infant Child dy'd, he said, <hi>I shall go to him; but he shall not return to me</hi>: I shall go to him into the <hi>Grave,</hi> and to him in <hi>Heaven</hi> too. And truly there is reason to <hi>believe</hi> this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all Children of Godly Parents dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Infancy: For GOD has taken them into His Covenant; that Covenant is a Covenant of Life; they have not Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated the Covenant; therefore we may hope that GOD has given them Eternal Life in <hi>Heaven,</hi> where they attain unto that <hi>Perfection,</hi> which in this world is not attainable. Do's not our Saviour say, that <hi>of such is the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>? Mat. 19.14. Therefore should <hi>Parents</hi> with a quiet spirit, submit unto such Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Divine Providence.</p>
               <p>Inf. II. <hi>The Joys of Heaven are Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful.</hi> As the <hi>Happiness of Souls there is Wonderfully Great,</hi> so their <hi>Joy must needs be so too.</hi> In One happy Day of their Death, they are <hi>Delivered</hi> from all <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows</hi> and from all <hi>Sin</hi> at Once; and this must <hi>needs</hi> cause an <hi>inexpressible Joy.</hi> What

Joy was there among the Children of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> when they saw themselves at <hi>Once for ever Saved</hi> from the <hi>Egyptians?</hi> They Sang for Joy. But what Songs of Joy do we think there are in <hi>Heaven,</hi> among <hi>the Spirits of Just men made Perfect</hi>? What Joyful <hi>Hallelujahs,</hi> when they know that they shall <hi>never Sorrow,</hi> nor <hi>Sin,</hi> nor be <hi>Tempted</hi> any more? In <hi>Heaven</hi> they have that <hi>Assurance.</hi> In this <hi>World,</hi> there are many <hi>true Believers,</hi> who have not <hi>Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> Nay, it is possible, that they may go out of the World under <hi>Doubts &amp; Fears</hi>: But as soon as they are among <hi>the Spirits of Just men made Perfect,</hi> they have <hi>Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for ever.</hi> This must <hi>needs cause Joy, &amp; Exceeding Joy.</hi> Jude 24. <hi>Presented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Presence of His Glory with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Joy.</hi> Some <hi>Believers</hi> in this Life, have had <hi>Prelibations</hi> of Heaven; some Blessed <hi>Foretasts</hi> of it.

Nay, more than that must be said the <hi>Joy</hi> there is greater than the capacious Soul of a faithful Servant of God is able to contain. Math. 25.21. <hi>Well done, thou good &amp; faithful Servant, enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord</hi> In this World, Joy enters into the Soul, but in Heaven the Soul enters into Joy.

great in respect of the continuance of them. <hi>Pleasures for evermore,</hi> Psal. 16.11. They are not like Earthly Joys which are but a flash, and over in a Moment: but the Joys of heaven are <hi>as the Days of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> they will continue as long as there shall be any heaven: They are lasting, yea everlasting Joys.

of holy Angels, but to a company of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. It was a dismal word which the Devil spoke to <hi>Saul,</hi> when he said to him, <hi>To morrow thou shalt be with me,</hi> 1 Sam. 28.19. The Sinner that dies to day, <hi>to morrow</hi> his Soul will be with Devils: his soul does not go to be with the spirits of Just men made perfect; but to the souls of those Wicked men, who have died and gone to Hell before him. When a wicked man dies, his soul goes to be with the soul of <hi>Cain,</hi> and of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and of <hi>Judas</hi>; with other Sons of Perdition. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted soul is carried to a woful Prison. It is said of the Sinners of the Old Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly world, that their <hi>Spirits,</hi> their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls are in <hi>Prison,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.19. Those horrid Giants which Lived before the Flood, their souls are in Hell; and when Ungodly men dy, their souls go to remain with them until the Great Day of Judgment. Prov. 21.16. <hi>The man that wanders out of the way of Understanding, shall remain in the Congregation of the Dead.</hi> In the Original it is, the Congregation of <hi>Rephaim, viz.</hi> of the Giants, who were
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:039533_0055_10142BC548EB5728"/>
Drown'd and Damn'd, when their Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was Overflown with a Flood. These are represented in the Scripture as being in Misery, and sighing because of their Misery. Those words in <hi>Job</hi> 26.5. which are translated, <hi>Dead things are form'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the water:</hi> A Learn'd and Great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positor reads, <hi>The Giants Sigh under the water</hi>; denoting the Misery of those wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, who Lived before and were De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd by the Flood; and so of all other sinners after their Bodies are Dead. The design of the Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> &amp; <hi>Lazarus,</hi> is to declare the Misery which Dead and Damn'd sinners are in before the Day of Judgment. While <hi>Dives</hi> lay Buried, he was in a place of Torment; and whilest his Brethren were yet Living on the Earth, and had the means of Grace vouchsafed to them; <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> to instruct them; which after the Day of Judgment they have not. Its true, that then they shall be in greater Misery than at present they are; when their Bodies as well as their Souls shall be in flaming Torment. Nevertheless, they are now in grievous
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:039533_0056_10142BC7E15D6990"/>
Misery. Despair is a Miserable thing: <hi>Francis Spira</hi> when he felt the horrors of it, thought it was worse than hell. The woful souls in hell, despair of ever seeing any Good: They know they shall never see any Earthly good more. Job 27.8. <hi>What is the hope of the Hypocrite, tho' he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?</hi> And which is an infinitely greater Misery, they Despair of ever obtaining the Pardon of their Sins, or the Salvation of their Souls. They know that their Day of Grace is past; and the thought of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Sentence which will be passed upon them at the great Day of Judgment, fills them with unspeakable Anguish and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. It is with them as with those who have Sinned Unpardonably: There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no more Sacrifice for sins; but a certain fearful looking for of Judgment, and of fiery Indignation which shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Adversaries.</p>
               <p>Inf. IV. <hi>Oh! That every One of us might make sure of this One thing, that when we Dy and leave this World, our immortal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:039533_0056_10142BC7E15D6990"/>
may go to be with the Spirits of Just men made Perfect.</hi> Christ has said, <hi>There is One thing Needful,</hi> Luk. 10.42. For us to make sure that we shall go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when we Dy, is that than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is or can be more Needful. We have Mortal Bodies; and Death for ought we know, may come upon us Suddenly. And every One of us has an Immortal Soul: Should not then every One of us be often thinking, If I should Dy this Night, what would become of my Soul? Is that safe for Eternity?</p>
               <p>Therefore make sure that we are now among Just men: That we are true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers on Christ, that so His Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness may be imputed to us for our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; That Death may <hi>find us in Him.</hi> And that we Live Righteous and Holy Lives, without which it will be a Vain thing for us to pretend unto having Faith. That Faith which is not attended with Works of New Obedience, is no Faith. Alas! Many men are like <hi>Balaam</hi>; he said, <hi>Let me Dy the Death of the Righteous, and let my</hi> [Afterwards] <hi>be like his.</hi> He
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:039533_0057_10142BCAC1276130"/>
knew that Righteous men will be Happy <hi>after this Life</hi>; that when their Bodies Dy, their Souls go to Heaven: Such a Death he was willing to have had; but took no care to Live the Life of the Righteous. If we are <hi>Perfect</hi> whilest in this world in respect of Sincerity, and an Entire Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Commandments of God, we shall be <hi>Perfect</hi> in Happiness, when we must be here no longer. Then when our Bodies rest in the Grave, our Souls will enter into Peace. For this we have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Promise, and with that I Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, Psal. 37.37. <hi>Mark the Perfect Man, and behold the Upright; for the End of that Man is Peace.</hi>

GOD should not be <hi>Mercenary:</hi> Men ought to serve Him, altho' they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no Reward for it. Whence <hi>Zadok,</hi> and those which were his Followers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded there would be no future Reward: Consequently no future World, or Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the Dead. Some of these came to our Lord JESUS CHRIST with an Objection<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> which they thought was an unanswerable Argument against the Resurrection of the Dead. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that there was a Woman Married to Seven Husbands successively: If there shall be a Resurrection, whose Wife of the Seven shall she then be? Christ gives them to understand, that they Reasoned like Ignorant men; and their want of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was the cause of their great Error. Another Evangelist asserts, that he said to them, <hi>Ye do Err, not knowing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor the Power of God,</hi> Mat. 22.29. The Scriptures affirm a Resurrection of the Dead. The Ancient <hi>Sadduces</hi> owned no part of the Scripture to be a Foundation for Faith, besides the Five Books of <hi>Moses.</hi> Therefore Christ Confuted them out of
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:039533_0058_10142BCDFA3C9990"/>
One of those Books, for which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the greatest Veneration. Nor were they duely apprehensive of what the Scripture declares concerning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power of GOD. Had they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered that as they ought to have done, they would not have tho't it impossible, nor would it have seem'd incredible to them, that He should Raise the Dead. Further to Convince them of their Error, Christ informs them, that they Argued from a false Principle: For their Objection supposeth, that in the <hi>Resurrection World</hi> there will be Marrying and giving in Marriage. Which is a very false Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, &amp; a gross Error. For altho' in this world, Marriage among mortal Men is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the continuance of Mankind: In that World in which men shall be immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliz'd, there will be no more Marriage than there is among the Angels of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Holy Angels</hi> are in the Scripture call'd the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> in respect of Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: They resemble the immortal GOD, more than any Other Creatures do. So are the Children of the Resurrection, call'd

the Children of God. They shall Live a Celestial Life, like the Angels; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble God as they do. And after the Day of Judgment, they shall be God's <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks:</hi> They shall Live with Him in the same House for ever; as Children dwell with their Father in their Fathers House.</p>

This is a truth which has been but little believed: Very few comparatively have given credit to it. For it is not known by the Light of Nature; Only by Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.

The Resurrection is asserted in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old Testament. Therefore the <hi>Jewish Church</hi> believed it: Their Faith of the Resurrection was built in special on that Scripture, Dan. 12.2. <hi>Many of them that sleep in the Dust of the Earth shall awake, some to everlasting Life, and some to Shame and everlasting Contempt.</hi> Sometimes in the Scripture, (and indeed very often) <hi>All</hi> denotes <hi>Many</hi>; and sometimes <hi>Many</hi> is put for <hi>All:</hi> So tis in the Scripture mention'd. In the first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made to Fallen man, the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Dead is Comprehended, viz. <hi>That the Seed of the Woman shall bruise the Serpents Head,</hi> Gen. 3.15.

great Plot contriv'd in the Head of the Old Serpent, was to bring an Eternal Death, both of Body and Soul upon all Mankind: The bruising of the Serpents Head intimates, that Christ has disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Plot, and deliver'd his Elect from that Death which Sin has brought upon them.

There have been some pretenders to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Resurrection of the Body; but not of <hi>the same Numerical Body,</hi> which was put into the Grave. So said the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees</hi> many Ages since: So say the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> at this day. So that this has been an Old Error lately revived. As long ago as <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time; there were some such among Professed Christians, whom he justly calls, <hi>Partiarios Sententiae Saducaeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>; Half Sadduces, or <hi>Sharers with the Sadduces,</hi> in their Opinion of denying the Resurrection.

It strikes at a Fundamental Article in our Christian Religion. I shall therefore fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther insist on the Truth before us, and mention several things for our Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Establishment in the Faith of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

<pb n="121" facs="unknown:039533_0065_10142BE2B96FACA0"/>
but in our <hi>English</hi> Bibles they run thus, <hi>I know that my Redeemer lives, and that he shall stand at the latter Day on the Earth; and though after my skin Worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for my self, &amp; mine eyes shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, &amp; not another, tho' my reins be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed within me,</hi> Job 19.25, 26, 27. He did not think, that after the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection he should have an <hi>Aerial Body</hi>; but that he should have <hi>Flesh,</hi> &amp; that he should have <hi>Bodily Eyes,</hi> the same that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death; and that with them, he should <hi>see GOD his Redeemer</hi>; namely our Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who is GOD as well as Man; and because he is a Man He may be seen with Bodily Eyes. One reason why Believers shall have Bodily Eyes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to them at the Latter day, is, that so they may behold the Glory of the <hi>God-man</hi> JESUS CHRIST. <hi>Job</hi> more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over says, <hi>I, my self,</hi> and <hi>not another.</hi> How can words be more Exprest?

as plainly and demonstratively, as if he had pointed with his Finger and said, <hi>This very Body.</hi> Again, he says to the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,</hi> Christ shall Change <hi>our Vile Body, that it may be Fashioned like unto His Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Body,</hi> Phil. 3.21.

And altho' since his Ascension, his Body is become more Glorious than the Sun in the Firmament: When he appeared to <hi>Saul,</hi> it was with a <hi>Light above the brightness of the Sun,</hi> Act. 26.13. Yet nevertheless, it remains a body still. That very Body which was Once hanging on the Cross at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> is now at the Right Hand of GOD in Heaven. From Heaven he declares, as in Rev. 1.18. <hi>I am He that Liveth &amp; was Dead; and behold I am Alive for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> The same Body which was Dead is now Alive, and may be seen with bodily Eyes: For so did the Martyr <hi>Stephen</hi> see him, Act. 7.55, 56. <hi>He Looked up stead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly into Heaven, &amp; saw the Glory of God, &amp; Jesus standing at the Right Hand of God.</hi> There appeared a wonderful Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and at the Right Hand of that Glory, he saw the Man JESUS standing; he said, <hi>I see the Heavens Opened, &amp; the Son of Man standing at the Right Hand of God.</hi>

That Humane Nature, which the Eternal Son of GOD has assumed, will never be laid aside: He is a Man still.

Can we think, that the Body which has joyned with the Soul in Sinning against God, shall escape Punishment; and another Body that never Sinned, suffer the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of Eternal Fire? How does that stand with Justice? And as for the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant of Christ, his Body has joyned with his Soul in serving the Lord; and therefore that very Body shall be a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Glory. That Head which has been contriving to promote the Glory of GOD, that Tongue which has been speaking for Him, those Hands which have been at work for Him, those Feet which have been going about to do good, shall be

               <p n="4">4. The Bodies as well as the Souls of Believers are Redeemed by Christ, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Him, and Sanctified by his Spirit dwelling in them. Therefore they are the bodies, and not Others instead of them, which shall be Raised up to Eternal Life at the Last Day. That very body which the believing soul now lives in, and shall dye and be put into the grave, has been Redeemed with the Blood of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. Can we imagine, that the body which Christ has Purchased with his Blood, shall never Rise out of the Grave; but that his soul after the Resurrection shall dwell in another body, which Christ never dy'd for the Redemption of it? That body which belongs to Christ as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Mystical Body, which is Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him shall Rise to Glory. This is to be affirm'd of the mortal body, which the believing soul now abides in. 1 Cor. 6.15. <hi>Know ye not that your Bodies are the members of Christ?</hi> Christ has by his Spirit taken Possession, not Only of the
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:039533_0068_10142BE8006691D0"/>
believers soul, but of his body also: which is the reason of its being raised up to an Everlasting Life: Rom. 8.11. <hi>If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the Dead, Dwell in You: He that raised Christ from the Dead, shall also Quicken your mortal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, by his Spirit which Dwells in you.</hi> That body in which the Holy Spirit dwells, is the body that shall dy, and that shall be made alive again. The body of the true Believer is a subject of Sanctification; and therefore that very body shall be a subject of Glorification. He has given himself, soul and body to God in Jesus Christ, and has served God with both; therefore both shall Live Eternally: Rom. 12.1. <hi>Present your Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto GOD, which is your reasonable Service.</hi>

                  <hi>Wonderful will be the Happiness of the Children of GOD in the Resurrection World.</hi> It has been shewed, that the Happiness of the Saints of GOD in another World will be Wonderfully Great; and that their <hi>Souls</hi> do attain unto a Blessed Perfection in <hi>the Heavenly Paradise,</hi> when in a state of Separation from their Bodies: We now proceed to shew, that there will be a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Addition to their Happiness and Glory, in the Resurrection World. For

then their Immortal Spirits shall not loose any thing of that Perfection, which they had in a Separate State: but their bodies will have a Glory, which in this World they had not.</p>
               <p>In Order to the Clearing and Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Truth before us, several things may be mentioned as Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Children of GOD shall <hi>in that World,</hi> in diverse respects attain unto An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Perfection. The Text before us says, <hi>They shall be Equal to the Angels</hi>: Which another Evangelist Expresseth by saying, They shall be <hi>as the Angels of GOD in Heaven</hi>: i. e. Very like unto them. Which is not to be so understood, as if they should in all respects be as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are. We may not suppose, that the Humane Nature shall be turned into the Angelical Nature. <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> are of different Natures. It is said of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>lso himself likewise took part of the same,</hi> Heb. 2.14. Angels have not Flesh and

Blood. Nor did Christ take on him the Angelical Nature, <hi>verse</hi> 16. Angels have not bodies as Christ had, and still has, and ever will have, a body which (as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was said) may be seen with bodily eyes. Mark 14.62. <hi>You shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of Power, and coming in the Clouds of Heaven.</hi> Then the Eyes of every man in the World shall see him. Rev. 1.7. <hi>Behold, he cometh with Clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they also that pierced him.</hi> But the Angelical Nature is invisible to bodily eyes. And therefore when tis said, That the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Resurrection shall be <hi>as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> we may not think that they will loose their Humane Nature, and be turned into Angels. <hi>Angels</hi> are in respect of their Nature, <hi>Spirits</hi>: Psal. 104.4. <hi>He has made his Angels Spirits</hi>: but men shall not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

difference. If it is a Spirit it is not a Body; if it is a Body it is not a Spirit. When therefore Christ appeared to his Disciples, after his Resurrection; and they were terrified supposing they had seen a <hi>Spirit</hi>; to convince them of their Error he said to them, <hi>A Spirit has not Flesh and Bones as you see me have,</hi> Luk. 24.39.

               <p>More particularly,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Angels excel in Wisdom &amp; Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. It is said concerning the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Time when the Day of Judgment shall begin, <hi>Of that Hour knows no man, no not the Angels of heaven,</hi> Mat. 24.36. impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that Angels have a great measure of Knowledge. Davids great Wisdom was set forth by saying, He was <hi>wise according to the Wisdom of an Angel of God, to know all things that are on the Earth,</hi> 2 Sam. 14.20. The Children of the Resurrection shall be adorned with Angelical Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. If their Souls attain unto a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Perfection in Knowledge whilest in their Separate State, (as from another Scripture has been declared) that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge will not be diminished by a re-union with the Body, in the Resurrection World<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> What an imperfect Knowledge has a Child compared with the Knowledge of a Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man?

                  <pb n="133" facs="unknown:039533_0071_10142BF0DCBC3B50"/>
the Children of God have whilest in <hi>this World,</hi> and that which they shall have in <hi>that World.</hi> Hence the Apostle speaks as in 1 Cor. 13.11. <hi>When I was a Child, I spake as a Child, I understood as a Child, I thought as a Child, but when I became a Man I put away Childish things.</hi> Our Knowledge now is weak and childish, but then it will be manly and perfect.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Angels of heaven are called <hi>Holy Angels,</hi> Math. 25.31. They are the <hi>Holy Ones</hi> the Prophet speaks of, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4 17. They are perfectly pure from Sin. When they appeared to men, their Raiment has been <hi>White,</hi> an Emblem of their <hi>Purity</hi> as well as their <hi>Glory.</hi> But thus shall it be with the Children of God, in the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection World. They shall have no more Sin in them, than the Angels of heaven have. Then will the Spouse of Christ be <hi>all fair, and no spot in her,</hi> Cant. 4 7. <hi>It will be a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemish,</hi> Eph. 5.27. We are taught to Pray, <hi>Thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.</hi> So it shall be in the Resurrection

World. Saints on Earth will then do the Will of God, with a perfection Equal to that of Angels in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">[2.] The Children of the Resurrection cannot dye. So it is said in the Text be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us: <hi>Neither can they dye any more.</hi> It is on this account especially that they are said to be <hi>Equal with the Angels,</hi> viz. In respect of a <hi>blessed Immortality.</hi> It is to be affirmed of Angels, not only that they <hi>shall not,</hi> but that they <hi>cannot</hi> dye. It is said of the Immortal Souls of men that they cannot be killed; much more may it be said of Angels, they cannot be killed. God who made them is able to <hi>Annihilate</hi> them, but they cannot dye: they cannot be resolved into pre-existent Principles, because they were not made out of such. In this World there is not a man but what shall dye: <hi>What man is he that liveth and shall not see death?</hi> But in the Resurrection World there is not one that shall dye. They who were Mortal in <hi>this World,</hi> become Immortal in <hi>that World.</hi> There it is that <hi>Mortality is swallowed up of Life,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.4. So are the Children of the Resurrection,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:039533_0072_10142BF3EDBE20F8"/>
                  <hi>as the Angels of heaven.</hi> Some may say, but is it not said of the blessed God, That <hi>He only</hi> has Immortality, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Ans.</hi> It is most true, that <hi>He only</hi> has Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality <hi>Originally.</hi> He only has Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality <hi>from Himself</hi>: but Angels have <hi>Immortality</hi> by the <hi>Gift of God.</hi> They are not subject to any decay of Nature as Mortal Creatures are. Notwithstanding they have lived more than five Thousand years, they are as strong and vigorous as ever they were, without any the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay. So shall it be with the Children of the Resurrection. There they <hi>Eat of the Tree of Life,</hi> the meaning of which, is, that the <hi>Gift of Immortality</hi> is conferred on them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7. But of this further under the next <hi>Demonstration</hi> of the <hi>Proposition</hi> before us; Which is,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Resurrection body will be adorned with very glorious Properties, in respect whereof wonderful will be the Happiness of the Children of God, in the Resurrection World. The Apostle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Four Properties of the Resurrection Body, which we shall a little insist on, and enquire into.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="136" facs="unknown:039533_0073_10142BF68E365DE0"/>(1.) Incorruption: 1 Cor. 15.42. <hi>It is sown in Corruption, it is raised in Incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The Apostle comes over with it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, in Ver. 53. <hi>This Corruptible must put on Incorruption.</hi> The <hi>Immortality</hi> of the Resurrection body, is implied in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption</hi> of it. Since Sin has entred into the world, there is nothing more subject to Mortality, than the frail Bodies of men. They no sooner begin to Live, but they begin to Dy: They are subject to Death by a thousand Casualties; also by inward Diseases. There are the seeds of all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases in the body, which prove Mortal to it. Besides, Nature does in time decay. If there were no other Disease to hasten Death, Old Age is a Disease which will infallibly bring to the Grave at last; and there it becomes <hi>Corruption</hi> it self. Job 17.14. <hi>I have said to Corruption, thou art my Father; to the Worm thou art my Mother &amp; my Sister.</hi> They and I shall dwell in the same House together, as Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Brothers and Sisters use to do. The Grave is that House. But the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection body is subject to no Death: It
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:039533_0073_10142BF68E365DE0"/>
will be an <hi>heavenly body.</hi> Then the souls of Believers will be Cloathed upon, and dwell in <hi>their House which is from heaven.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.1. <hi>They have born the image of the Earthly; but they shall bear the image of the Heavenly,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.49. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection Body will abide like <hi>the Days of heaven,</hi> without being subject to any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay. There have been some few in the world, whose bodies had been Dead, but were restored to Life again: So it was with <hi>Lazarus</hi>; and some few Others men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Scripture, both in the Old and in the New Testament. These Dy'd again. It shall not be so with the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God in the Resurrection at the Last Day. They shall have a <hi>better Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> than those had, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. When they awake out of the dust where their bodies have been sleeping, it will be <hi>to Everlasting Life,</hi> Dan. 12.2. As our Saviour CHRIST, when He rose from the Dead, was no more subject to death: Rom. 6 9. <hi>Christ being raised from the Dead, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="138" facs="unknown:039533_0074_10142BF878DC4A28"/>
Children of God, when they are Once the Children of the Resurrection. But more than this is impli'd in the <hi>Incorruptibility</hi> of the Body. If <hi>Adam</hi> had not Sinn'd, he shou'd have been Immortal; he shou'd never have Died; which was implied in the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in case he did Eat of the Forbidden Tree; <hi>In the Day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely Dye,</hi> Gen. 2.17. We might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally infer, that if he did continue in his Obedience, he should surely Live and not Dy: Yet we cannot say, that he should have been <hi>Incorruptible.</hi> When tis said the Resurrection Body will be Incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that intends its not being subject to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Alteration. <hi>Adam</hi>'s body before Sin entred into the world, was naturally sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Alteration: It was naturally sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to an expense of Spirits, and might have been killed with Hunger, and would have been so, if Food had not been mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to him. The <hi>Tree of Life</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for him, which had (I doubt not) a Natural Vertue in it for the prolonga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life. Therefore his Body was not made <hi>Incorruptible.</hi> It was subject to
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:039533_0074_10142BF878DC4A28"/>
Passion. A great blow would have hurt it. Fire would have consumed it. But the Resurrection Body will be <hi>Impassible</hi>: No Natural thing can hurt it. That which hapned to the three Princes who were cast into <hi>Nebuchadnezzars burning fiery Furnace, upon whose Bodies the Fire had no Power,</hi> was a Miraculous Providence; but the Resurrection Bodies of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, will not be subject to suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by Fire any more than their Souls shall. In this the Raised Bodies of Saints and Sinners will differ. And Believers shall be far more happy than <hi>Adam</hi> was. It could not be said of <hi>Adam, he cannot Dye.</hi> He was sensible that he might possibly Dy. Nor did the Serpent say to our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that there was no <hi>Possibility</hi>; only that there was no <hi>Certainty</hi> of their Dying upon their Eating the forbidden Fruit. He said, Gen. 3.4. <hi>You shall not surely Dy.</hi> But the <hi>Resurrection Body</hi> of the Believer, is so Immortaliz'd as that there is not a Possibility of its Dying any more, which is meant by the <hi>Incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of it. Thus are the Children of
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:039533_0075_10142BFA3521F1A8"/>
the Resurrection, <hi>Equal to the Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Another Property of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection Body, is the <hi>Glory</hi> wherewith it shall be Adorned: 1 Cor. 15.43. <hi>It is sown in Dishonour, it is raised in Glory.</hi> Two things may be implied in that Glory: One of which is the Admirable <hi>Beauty</hi> of the Resurrection Body. <hi>Adam</hi> in his first Creation was a very Beautiful Person; without doubt far Exceeding <hi>Absalom</hi> in Beauty, of whom it is said, <hi>That in all</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>there was none so much to be Praised as</hi> Absalom <hi>for his Beauty; from the sole of his Foot even to the crown of his Head, there was no blemish in him,</hi> 2 Sam. 14.25. Some who are the Children of God, in this world have great Deformities in their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. And the most Beautiful Bodies, soon after they are Dead become Deformed; therefore are said to be <hi>sown in Dishonour</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> When the Body is <hi>Sown,</hi> when it is put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ground, it soon becomes a deformed unlovely <hi>Carcass:</hi> But when Raised from Death, the Beauty of it will be Perfect<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> because of the Comeliness which God wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> then put upon it. Again, This <hi>Glory</hi> in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>tends
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:039533_0075_10142BFA3521F1A8"/>
                  <hi>Brightness</hi> as well as Beauty; A <hi>shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Splendor.</hi> This is Emphatically cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Glory. Ver. 41. <hi>There is One Glory of the Sun, and another Glory of the Moon, and another Glory of the Stars; for One Star Differs from another Star in Glory.</hi> The Sun Out-shines the Moon; the Moon Out-shines the Planets. These are <hi>two great Lights,</hi> Gen. 1.16. The Moon Out-shines the other Planets, which are <hi>Stars of Light,</hi> Psal, 148.3. Planets shine with a greater Light than fixed Stars. Some of these shine with a greater Light than Others. Hence are they said to differ in <hi>Glory.</hi> And so will it be with the Children of God, in the Resurrection world. Whil'st in this world, their Souls are in a dark Lanthorn: The Earthly Body is a dark Lanthorn; but it will not be so after the Resurrection. That <hi>Celestial Body</hi> will shine Gloriously. When our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> was Transfigured in the holy Mount, and <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; <hi>Elias</hi> appeared in Glory, tis said, <hi>His Face did shine as the Sun, and his Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was white as the Light.</hi> This was but a Glympse of that Glory which CHRIST
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:039533_0076_10142BFE4D6634D0"/>
and his Saints shall appear in at the Last Day. When <hi>Moses</hi> had been Conversing with GOD in the Mount, his Face shone with such Brightness, that the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were not able to Look upon him for <hi>the Glory of his Countenance,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.7. Much more will it be so, when the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of GOD shall Ever be with the LORD. It is said of <hi>Stephen,</hi> that when he was convented before the Council, <hi>they saw his Face as it had been the Face of an Angel</hi>; importing that it did shine with rays of Light, as the Face of an appearing Angel used to do, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.15. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.3. How much more will the Faces of GOD's Children shine in the Resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion World; when they shall be as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God in Heaven? The Scripture says, that <hi>they shall shine as the brightness of the Firmament, and as the Stars for ever &amp; ever,</hi> Dan. 12.3. Nay, more; They shall <hi>shine as the Sun.</hi> This is a great Truth, and men cannot Easily believe it: Wherefore CHRIST affirms it with great Solemnity; Mat. 13.43. <hi>Then shall the Righteous shine forth as the Sun, in the
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:039533_0076_10142BFE4D6634D0"/>
Kingdom of their Father. Who has Ears to hear, Let him hear</hi>; Importing that this is so wonderful a Truth, as that <hi>Men</hi> will hardly give Credit to it. There is no Creature seen by us, that shines with so great a Glory as <hi>the Sun</hi> does.

Meat and Drink agree with the Natural body, and that body is for them: but it is otherwise with the Spiritual body. It is said, <hi>Meat is for the belly, and the belly for Meats, but God shall destroy both it and them,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.13. <hi>The belly,</hi> i. e. the Stomach craves for Meat, and God has made &amp; appointed Meats suitable for the Natural Appetites of the body, but the Resurrection body is not for Meats, nor Meat for it. The <hi>Spiritual body</hi> will have no need, nor desire of Meat or Drink. It shall never hunger or thirst. One of our English Martyrs, a faithful Minister (his Name was <hi>Robert Samuel</hi>) after the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> (bloody <hi>Bonner</hi>) caused him to be cast into Prison, he there suffered much by hunger and thirst; The night before his Death, an Angel appeared to him in his sleep, saying, Be of good comfort <hi>Samuel,</hi> for after this day thou shalt never suffer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Children of the Resurrection shall stand in no more need of Meat and Drink or Sleep, than the Angels of Heaven do. In that respect they shall be <hi>Equal to the Angels.</hi> They shall Live a Spiritual and Angelical Life. The body shall then be no Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Soul as now it is. In this state of Infirmity, <hi>the Spirit is willing, but the Flesh is weak,</hi> Math. 26.41. It will not be so after the Resurrection. The <hi>Spiritual body</hi> will be gloriously possessed and acted by the Almighty Spirit of God, who raised it from the dead. Thus shall the Resurrection body be a Spiritual body<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> And because it is so, it will be able (which now it cannot) to <hi>ascend</hi> as well as descend

So shall the raised Saints be <hi>as the Angels of Heaven,</hi> who can as easily ascend as descend. There is a Scripture which not only the old Jewish Interpreters, but Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Christian Expositors, conceive, has respect to what the Children of God will be able to do after the Resurrection; It is that, Isa. 40.31. <hi>They shall mount up with wings as Eagles.</hi> And because their <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> shall be <hi>Spiritual,</hi> they will be able to move with wonderful <hi>Agility</hi> &amp; <hi>Celerity.</hi> They shall in that respect also, be <hi>as the Angels of Heaven.</hi> An Angel goes from one place to another with the greatest swiftness. It is said of the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> that he did <hi>fly swiftly,</hi> Dan. 9.21. As Lightning in a Moment of Time flies from one side of Heaven to the other. Such like is the motion of Angels: Heb. 1.7. <hi>He makes his Angels Spirits, his Ministers a flame of fire.</hi> We read of <hi>Asahel,</hi> that he was <hi>light of foot as a wild roe,</hi> 2 Sam. 2.18. The <hi>Spiritual bodies</hi> of the Children of the Resurrection, will be able to go from place to place with an incomparably swifter motion, than any Creature on the

Earth can do. The raised bodies of Gods Children will some of them be ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Miles distant from the place where Christ shall Erect his Throne at the Day of Judgmenr, yet shall they be with him in a Moment. Say not, But <hi>how is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for a Corporeal Substance to move with such Celerity?</hi> Is not the Light a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Substance? Yet it comes down from the Sun and from the Stars (no man can say how many Millions of Miles,) in a few Minutes of an hour. The old Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers suppose that the Sun goes above a Million of Miles in the space of an hour. The raised Saints shall (as has been shewed) out shine the Sun in glory, and then (sayes our Judicious Mr. <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>None besides the Children of God shall have a blessed Resurrection.</hi> The Text before us speaks of their Resurrection on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. All and only such shall be <hi>as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of Heaven.</hi> The Jewish Writers (some of them) have a fond and heretical Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that <hi>only Israelites shall have a Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of their bodies.</hi> It is true, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> but such as are <hi>Israelites indeed in whom there is no guile</hi> shall have an happy Resurrection. Although all the dead shall come out of their Graves, the evil as well as the good, the unjust as well as the just; Not only they whose Souls are in Heaven, but they whose Souls are in Hell shall have their bodies restored to Life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at the day of Judgment. The Sea <hi>shall give up the dead which are in it, and death,</hi> that is the Grave shall give up the dead which are in it, and <hi>Hell shall deliver up the dead in it,</hi> the Souls which are there shall Live in their Bodies again; Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, the Resurrection of the Wicked is as no Resurrection at all. Theirs is called the <hi>Resurrection of Damnation,</hi> Joh.
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:039533_0083_10142C11588ABED0"/>
5.29. The Souls in Hell wish that their bodies might never Live again. Like as men who are in a sad Prison, had rather be always there and to endure their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Misery, than to be fetched out from thence only to be Condemn'd to a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Death and Executed. So it is the case here. The Souls of men who have dyed in their Sins are in a Prison, and so are their bodies too, the Grave is their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. At the universal Resurrection they must be bro't out of Prison Body &amp; Soul, to have a Sentence of Eternal death passed upon them, to be Doomed unto Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting fire: so that their Resurrection will be worse than none at all. The <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God</hi> are properly <hi>the Children of the Resurrection.</hi> They only shall have a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection unto Life</hi>; others unto <hi>the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Death.</hi> The Scripture speaks Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically of the <hi>Resurrection of the Just,</hi> Luk. 14.14. The <hi>unjust</hi> shall not receive an <hi>happy reward.</hi> The Resurrection of Believers on Christ, proceeds from such Causes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>

                  <pb n="157" facs="unknown:039533_0083_10142C11588ABED0"/>1. It is because of the Covenant which they are in with God, that they are made partakers of an happy Resurrection. As for Unbelievers, although some of them pretending to Christianity may be Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in Covenant with God, they are not Internally and Really so, and therefore their Resurrection cannot be by vertue of that Covenant which they never had a Real Interest in: but Believers have. By this Argument Christ proved against the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> that there will be a Resurrection, as we see in the Verse following our Text before us, <hi>That the dead are raised Moses shewed in the bush, when he called the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, for he is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living.</hi> Those holy Patriarchs were Dead and in their Graves when God said to <hi>Moses, I am their God,</hi> I am in Covenant with them. That which is in Covenant with GOD shall Live Eternally, therefore so shall the bodies of his Children, which implies their Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. For the <hi>Covenant</hi> is made with the <hi>Person</hi> consisting of Body &amp; Soul, and
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:039533_0084_10142C1335F0C6E0"/>
not with the Soul only altho' principally. Hence the bodies of Believers and not their Souls only are the Subjects of the Seals of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> So concerning <hi>Baptism</hi> the first Seal of the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the body is the Subject of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. Believers have their body wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with pure Water. The Lord sayes to the true Believer, as sure as thou hast been Baptized, so certain is it that thy body shall have a blessed Resurrection. He has therein Communion with Christ in respect of the benefits both of his Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4. He shall as sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be raised up at the Last Day to Eternal Life as Christ is risen. Moreover, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers do with their bodies <hi>Sacramentally,</hi> as well as with their Souls by <hi>Faith,</hi> feed upon Christ Exhibited in the <hi>Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> That body which does with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Soul Eat the <hi>Flesh</hi> and drink the <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ, shall have a Resurrection to Everlasting Life. Joh. 6.54. <hi>Whoso eats my flesh and drinks my blood has Eterna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

proceed from Gods Covenant with him. The Resurrection of the body to Eternal Life, is a special Promise contained in the Covenant, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.25.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Resurrection of Believers is Purchased for them by the <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ. We cannot say so of Unbelievers dying in their Sins. It is by the Death of Christ that we are Redeemed from the Curse of the Law, of which the death of the body is some part. Christ by shedding his <hi>blood</hi> did Merit his Own Resurrection. He was <hi>brought back again from the dead through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant,</hi> Heb. 13.20. The same is to be affirmed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as we see in that Scripture to which the Text to the Hebrews has a respect, <hi>viz.</hi> Zech. 9.11, 12. <hi>By the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant I have sent forth thy Prisoners out of the pit. Turn ye Prisoners of hope.</hi> The <hi>Grave</hi> is a <hi>Prison,</hi> but the <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ has caused the Prison door to be opened, the bodies of Belivers which <hi>Rest</hi> there in <hi>Hope</hi> shall come out of that pit. All that Redemption which Believers shall be the Subject of, is M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Christ. Rev. 5.9. <hi>Thou hast Redeemed us by thy Blood.</hi> The <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the body is part of that Redemption. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaks of the <hi>Redemption of the Body,</hi> Rom 8.23. The <hi>Bodies</hi> as well as the Souls of Believers are said to be <hi>bought,</hi> 1 Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>. 6 20 It is the <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ and nothing else that has bought them</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is by vertue of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ that Believers obtain a blessed <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</hi> Thus does the Apostle argue. 1 Cor. 15.12, 13. <hi>If Christ be Preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no Resurrection? If there be no Resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen.</hi> As sure as Christ is risen, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers on him shall rise. For he rose as a <hi>Publick Person</hi> Representing all the Elect of God. Verse 21, 22. <hi>Since by man came death, by Man came also the Resurrection of the Dead, for as in Adam all dy, so in Christ all shall be made alive.</hi> There are two roots from which Death and Life proceed, <hi>viz.</hi> Adam &amp; Christ. The first Adam, by reason of his being a Publick Person Representing all Mankind, has been
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:039533_0085_10142C15E7574618"/>
a root of death to all his Children. Christ <hi>the second Adam,</hi> Representing all the Children of God, has been a root of Life to them all. Because He Rose from the dead and Liveth for ever more, they shall do so too. This also may be denoted by that Expression of Christs being <hi>the first born from the Dead,</hi> Col 1.18. Under the Law, a Ransom was to be Paid for the First born, and then the rest of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were free, because the first born was a Publick Person, Representing all the Children of the Family. Thus, if Christ is Redeemed from the Power of the Grave, then so are all the Children of God in him. When Christ opened the Womb of the Grave and came forth, then all Believers were freed by vertue of the Ransom which HE had paid. Hence also, the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Christ is mentioned as a <hi>first fruits. Christ is risen from the Dead, and became the first fruits of them that slept,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.20. The first Fruits were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated, and by vertue of that Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>anctified. Thus inasmuch as Christ is
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:039533_0086_10142C17986291A8"/>
Risen, all the dead Bodies of the Children of God, which are as so many grains of Corn sowen in the Ground, are consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and virtually Risen with Christ. And this also is peculiar to Believers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is by vertue of their Union with Christ, that Believers obtain a blessed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. As for Unbelievers they are not United to Christ, and therefore have not a Resurrection unto Life. He that has not the Son, has not Life. Christ and all true Believers, are One <hi>Mystical Body.</hi> The blessed Head of that Body has been victorious over Death, and triumph'd over the Grave. Therefore so shall all the Members which belong to that Head Because of that intimate Union which is between Christ and Believers, some Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which speak of the Resurrection, are to be understood both of Christ and of his Church. Thus, Hos. 6.2. <hi>After two Days he will Revive us, in the third Day he will Raise us up, and we shall Live in his sight.</hi> The Words allude to the Resurrection o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> Christ, yet are applied to the Church which is Risen with Christ their Head
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:039533_0086_10142C17986291A8"/>
Because Christ was Raised from the dead, Believers shall Live in his sight for ever. And thus also may we understand that Scripture; Isa. 26.19. <hi>Thy Dead body shall Live, together with my Dead body shall they arise. Awake and Sing, ye that sleep in the Dust.</hi> Christ says to the Believer, Thy dead body did Rise with Mine. When my dead Body rose out of the Grave, thine did so too. The Resurrection of my dead Body, was a pledge &amp; certain fore-runner of the Resurrection of thy dead Body.</p>
               <p>From the <hi>Doctrine</hi> thus Confirmed, we may <hi>Infer</hi> several things for our Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Righteousness.</p>
               <p>Inf. I. <hi>All the Children of GOD are Infinitely beholden to the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> They are beholden to Him for the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of their Bodies. The Apostles <hi>Preached through Jesus the Resurrection from the Dead,</hi> Act. 4.2. We had never had an happy Resurrection if it had not been <hi>through Jesus.</hi> And therefore not One that shall dy in a Christless Estate will
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:039533_0087_10142C1927889EE8"/>
have such a Resurrection. Christ has made Believers to be happier than Ever Adam in Paradise was. For the present they are under a better Covenant. The Covenant of Grace is better than the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, and Established upon better Promises. It is through Jesus Christ, that we are concerned in that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42.6. There are heavenly blessings, and such a glorious Perfection of Happiness Promised to Believers on Christ, as we cannot say Adam had a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of. That Heaven which is Promised to Believers, does incomparably Excel the Earthly Paradise which belonged to Adam, and in which he should have Lived happily with a Confluence of Earthly blessings, if he had not Sinned. And for the present, Believers appear before God in a more glorious Righteousness than Adam had before his fall. He had only a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of his Own, which was not the Righteousness of One that is God; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Righteousness of God is upon all that believe,</hi> Rom. 3.22. The Righteousness of Christ is imputed to them, and that is
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:039533_0087_10142C1927889EE8"/>
the Righteousness of God. And when Believers shall become the Children of the Resurrection, they will be far more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than ever Adam was. He was made <hi>Lower than the Angels,</hi> and not <hi>Equal</hi> to them in his first and best Estate. But as for Believers, Christ has advanced them to an Equality with Angels in more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects than one, as we have shewed. Oh<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> how are we beholden to Christ? Nay, in respect of him they are dignified above Angels. For <hi>He took not on him the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Angels,</hi> but the Nature of Man He has assumed. The Believer is nearer akin to the Son of God, than any Angel in heaven is.</p>
               <p>Inf. II. <hi>There is a respect due to the Dead Bodies of Gods Children.</hi> Since they shall be Raised out of their Graves to such Glory as has been shewed, there is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a respect due to them. Altho' we may not worship their <hi>Reliques</hi> as Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Papists do, Nevertheless, it is a great iniquity to cast contempt upon them. Precious in the sight of the Lord is the
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:039533_0088_10142C1BF57230A0"/>
Death of his Saints. When their dead Bodies are turned to dust, it is <hi>Precious Dust.</hi> That Body which is United to Christ, and has been Redeemed by his <hi>Blood,</hi> Death does not separate from his Love. They then who manifest their contempt and hatred of such holy Bodies, have not the Love of Christ nor his Spirit in them. A decent Burial is a respect due to the Bodies of Dead Saints. To deny it to those who are the Children of God, is great Impiety; or not to suffer them to have that honourable Interment which is due to their Station. It is noted as a great wickedness in <hi>Jehojakim,</hi> that he would not permit the Prophet <hi>Urijah</hi> to be so honourably Buried as was proper and sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for a Prophet of God, but he <hi>Cast his Dead Body into the Graves of the common People.</hi> And it is Observable, that the Providence of God met with him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliated his impiety upon him.

Such like Barbarity would the Heathen some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times use towards the Servants of the Lord, of which the Psalmist complains, Psal. 79.2, 3. <hi>The Dead Bodies of thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have they given to be Meat unto the fowls of the Heaven, the flesh of thy Saints unto the beasts of the Earth: And there was none to bury them.</hi> And Papists have been as inhumane as ever were Pagans. It was Prophesied concerning them, that they would kill the faithful Witnesses of Christ, and <hi>not suffer their Dead Bodies to be put in Graves,</hi> Rev. 11.9. That Prophesy has been fulfilled as in other Places, so in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when Popery reigned there. By the Popes decree, the bones of <hi>Wickliff</hi> (that famous Witness against the Idolatry of those times) Forty years after he was Dead and Buried, were dug out of his Grave and Burnt to ashes, and those ashes thrown into a River. The Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. was a Person of more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity and humanity than the Pope, for

when some urged him to cause <hi>Luther</hi> to be exhumated, he utterly refused it.

There are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God who are Afflicted with Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Weaknesses and Infirmities; and it may be for a Long time.

There will be no Bodily Infirmities to complain of in the Resurrection World. This also affords Comfort to the Children of God, against the Fear of Death. God said to <hi>Jacob, Be not afraid to go Down into</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, <hi>I will surely bring thee up again,</hi> Gen. 46.3, 4. So He says to the Believer, Be not afraid to go down into the Grave, I will surely bring thee up again; and in the mean time, <hi>Thou shalt see Joseph,</hi> thy Soul shall be with <hi>IESUS.</hi> Therefore should they go into the Grave, not only Willingly but Chearfully.

So Godly Parents will know their Children, and Children their Parents: Many a Father will then Bless GOD for giving him such Children; and Children for giving them such Parents. And many a Godly Mother, when she shall see her Children again at the Resurrection, will Bless GOD for making her the happy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of bringing Children into the world, which shall help to People Heaven with Inhabitants.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Let us make Sure that our Souls be Risen out of a State of SIN. Are our Souls Quickned, which Once were Dead in Trespasses and Sins? If our Souls have Experienced a <hi>Spiritual Resurrection,</hi> our Bodies shall have a Blessed Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the Last Day. Is there a Spiritual Life infused into our Souls? Is there a work of Saving Grace begun there? Have we truly Repented of all our Sins? Then they shall not Ly down with us in the Grave, and Rise up with us to Condemn us at the Great Day. Is there none in this Assembly, but what can say as in the Presence of GOD, I know not of any One

Sin I have been guilty of, but I have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed it, Repented of it; and through Christ my Peace is made with God? Are we true Believers on CHRIST? All and only such are Regenerate. Then there is a blessed Scripture for us to Meditate on, and take Comfort from: It is that, Joh. 11.25, 26. <hi>Jes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>s said, I am the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection and the Life; he that Believeth on me, though he were Dead, yet shall he Live. And whosoever Liveth, and Believeth on me, shall never Die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The way for us to Obtain a Blessed Resurrection of our Bodies, is to be always doing Good, and serving GOD whil'st we are in the Body. <hi>I have hope</hi> (says the Apostle) <hi>that there shall be a Resurrection of the Dead.</hi> And then he adds, <hi>Herein do I Exercise my self, to have always a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science Void of Offence toward God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward men,</hi> Act. 24.15, 16. When serious thoughts of the Resurrection, shall make a man diligent in Serving GOD, and in Endeavours to be Useful unto Men, that's
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:039533_0097_10142C340AA47CC0"/>
a sign of his being One that shall have a Blessed Resurrection. Then shall we receive a Reward according to what we have <hi>Done whilest in the Body.</hi> Works of Piety towards GOD, will then be Rewarded. Mat. 6.6. <hi>When thou Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, enter into thy Closet, and when thou hast shut thy Door, Pray to thy Father which is in Secret, and thy Father which Seeth in Secret, shall Reward thee Openly.</hi> And when will Prayer and other Works of Piety, be Rewarded Openly? In the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection World, they shall be Rewarded Openly before the whole World. The like is to be said concerning Acts of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards Men, they shall be <hi>Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed at the Resurrection of the Just,</hi> Luk. 14.14. And therefore the more Good we have done in the World, the greater will the Recompence of Reward then be; the Thought whereof should Encourage us to be very Laborious in Serving the LORD. Wherefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, after he had Discoursed Largely concerning the Resurrection of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

of GOD, makes this Conclusion; <hi>Be ye always Abounding in the Work of the Lord, for as much as ye know, that your Labour is not in Vain in the Lord,</hi> 1 Corinth. 15.58.

            <p>THE Apostle in the Third Verse of the Chapter, gives Thanks to God for these <hi>Colossians.</hi> In this Verse he mentions the Reasons why he did so. It was on the account of that Grace which was wrought in them, by the
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:039533_0099_10142C389910DEC0"/>
Preaching of the Gospel. There are two particular Graces instanced in.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Grace of Faith; described from the Object of it, Viz. CHRIST: <hi>Your Faith in Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Grace of Love; which is also described from the more peculiar Object of it, Viz. <hi>Saints</hi>; and all such. <hi>The Love which you have to all the Saints.</hi>

            <p>The words before us, are Expressive of that which was the <hi>moving Cause,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing these Believers to the Exercise of those Graces: The consideration of that Blessedness which they <hi>Hoped</hi> to Enjoy in another World, had this Effect upon them. <hi>Hope</hi> is here (as in other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) put for the Good Hoped for; which is Perfect Blessedness. Nothing less than that is the Object of the Believers <hi>Hope.</hi> And it is a Sure, Well-grounded <hi>Hope</hi>: They shall surely Obtain the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness they Hope for.

It is an Hope of his Own making: <hi>He kindles a Fire, and walks in the light of his Fire, and in the sparks which himself has kindled,</hi> Isa. 50.11. Hence his hope is compared to a <hi>Spiders web,</hi> Job 8.14. The Spider spins his web out of his own bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els: So does the Hypocrite his hope. But the Believers hope is of a Divine O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal: It is an hope of God's Begetting, of his Creating. <hi>He has begotten us unto a lively hope,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3. It is therefore a sure and a good hope; an hope that will end in the fruition of the good hoped for.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Believers Hope is built on CHRIST. 1 Tim. 1.1. <hi>The Lord Jesus Christ is our hope.</hi> He has been the hope of his People in all Ages of the world: Jer. 14.8. <hi>O the Hope of Israel, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour thereof.</hi> Who is that hope of <hi>Israel</hi>? It is Christ the Promised Messiah, who was to come into the world to be the Saviour of it. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> said to the Jews, <hi>For the hope of Israel I am bound with this Chain,</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="unknown:039533_0103_10142C3B32C60818"/>
Act. 28.20. It was for his Preaching Christ, that a Chain was upon him. Now Christ is a sure and safe Foundation for us to build our hope upon: Isa. 26.4. <hi>Trust ye in the Lord for ever; for in the Lord Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah is Everlasting Strength.</hi> He is called <hi>Tzur Gnolamim,</hi> the Rock of Ages. The <hi>house</hi> of the <hi>Believers hope is</hi> Founded <hi>on this Rock of Ages,</hi> therefore it shall not fail nor fall, but stand to <hi>Eternity.</hi> It is said <hi>of the wise builder,</hi> That <hi>he built his house upon a Rock, and the Rain descended, &amp; the Floods came, &amp; the winds blew &amp; beat upon the house, and it fell not, for it was founded upon a Rock,</hi> Mat. 7.24, 25. The true Believer is the wise Builder: Christ is the Rock on which his house, his hope is built and stands for ever. All the Powers of Darkness can never shake it. More particularly;</p>

Eternal Life. It comes to us not as due Wages, as Death is, but as the Free Gift of God: Rom. 6.23. <hi>The wages of Sin is Death, but the gift of God is Eternal Life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi> It was a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously Proud &amp; Insolent Speech of a Popish Jesuit, That if God would give him Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Gratis,</hi> he would not Accept of it on those terms; he would do something to deserve it at the hands of God. Our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and sinful Obedience (and the best that we do or can do is so) cannot be Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious of any thing but Death. Only the Obedience of Jesus Christ the Son of God, is Meritorious: Rev. 5.12. <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was slain.</hi> For his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is perfect, and without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. <hi>He has fulfilled all Righteousness,</hi> Mat. 3.15. There was no Precept of the Law of God whatsoever, that was a Duty incumbent on the <hi>Man Christ Jesus</hi> to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil it, but he has done it; and not failed in the manner of Performance. Now the Righteousness of this Obedience of Christ, is imputed to the true Believer on his Name. <hi>The Righteousness of God which is
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:039533_0104_10142C3CEE59FF50"/>
by Faith in Jesus Christ is upon all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> Rom. 3.22. That's the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of One who is God as well as Man, and therefore Infinitely Meritorious. Tis the only Righteousness which God will accept of in order to the Justification and Salvation of a Sinner; and it is Faith that does Entitle a man to this Righteousness, and make him able to say truly, <hi>This Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Righteousness is mine.</hi> God would make <hi>his Law Honourable &amp; Glorious</hi>: Therefore it must be Fulfilled, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Obeyed. This no man since <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, being involved in the Guilt of his sin, could ever do. Nevertheless, <hi>Believers</hi> in respect of their <hi>Surety,</hi> have done it. Sin has wounded and weakned men so, that they cannot obtain Righteousness &amp; Salvation by the Law; but then God has sent his Son, <hi>That the Righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us,</hi> Rom. 8.3, 4. Christ's Fulfilling of the Law is imputed to us, if we truly believe on his Name. God graciously accepts of what our Surety has done for us, as if we our selves had done the same. Moreover, in order to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:039533_0104_10142C3CEE59FF50"/>
of Divine Justice, it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that the Penalty of the Law should be endured. This also has Christ our Blessed <hi>Surety,</hi> been willing for our sakes to submit unto, that he might obtain our Reconcilation to GOD, and our being accepted as Righteous; 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>For he has made him to be Sin for us.</hi> It was by the holy Imputation of God that he was <hi>made so.</hi> Our Sins were imputed to Him, &amp; thence he was made a Sin-offering in our stead: <hi>That we might be made the Righteousness of God in him;</hi> That the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness which God will accept of might be imputed to us. This said <hi>Justin</hi> (one of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> in the Primitive times) <hi>was a sweet Exchange.</hi> And a later <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> said, <hi>Behold a Wonderful Exchange; Christ has my Sins, and I have his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi> This then is that which the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers hope of blessedness in Heaven is built upon: It is on the Merit of Christ's Blood; on the Obedience of his Passion, as well as on the Obedience of his Life. He has carried the Merit of his Blood to heaven with him. <hi>By his own Blood he entred

into the holy place, having obtained Eternal Redemption for us,</hi> Heb. 9.12. But there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore believers hope (as well may they hope) that they shall enter into heaven also. They may have, and should have an humble Confidence of it. Heb. 10.19. <hi>Having boldness to enter into the holiest of all, by the Blood of Jesus.</hi> What can keep out of heaven, but only Sin? The sins of Believers are all satisfied for. The Blood of Christ has made a full Atonement for them; and taken away the Guilt &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation due for them. This indeed no other blood could do. The blood of all the Sacrifices under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could not Purge the Conscience, or take away the Guilt of Sin. The Law made nothing Perfect, but <hi>the bringing in of a better Hope</hi> has done it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19. The Priesthood of Christ, the Sacrifice which he has offered, giveth unto Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a better ground of hope than the Law did. Because of the bringing in of this Hope, not only the Mercy of God, but his Justice also, concur and conspire in the Salvation of his People: Psal. 85.10.

                  <hi>Rome,</hi> have been accounted the greatest Cities that ever the Sun saw. Yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them were above Fifty Miles in Compass. Wherefore this Description of the heavenly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> does intimate unto us, that Heaven is of wonderful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. The Spaciousness of it, is incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Unbelieving World. All other Places and all Creatures are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within the Circumference of it. The Glorious GOD is an <hi>Immense</hi> Being, and therefore cannot be Contained within the Limits of Place: <hi>The heaven of heavens cannot Contain him,</hi> 1 King. 8.27. But the whole Creation is Circumscrib'd with the Heaven of Heavens. The Height of it is wonderful: It is the Top of the Creation. Nothing is above it. <hi>Glory be to God in the Highest,</hi> Luk. 2.14. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of heavens is the highest part of the Creation of God. <hi>That heaven for height is Unsearchable,</hi> Prov. 25.3. I know, Astronomers have their Conjectures about it; and they are but Conjectures. The Old Astronomers have maintained, that it is above Eighty Millions of Miles, from the

Earth to the Starry Heaven. Late A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomers, suppose it to be many times more, than that amounts unto. Not only Mathematicians, but some Divines have affirmed; That if a man should Travel an hundred Miles every Day, he would not in the space of Four Thousand Years, reach the Stars; and that the Third Heaven is above the Stars, as much as that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Earth. We know from the Scripture, that the <hi>Empyrean Heaven</hi> is Vastly above the highest Stars, but how much higher no man can say. And it is Presumption in those men, who go about to Determine it. Hence <hi>Eliphaz</hi> said to <hi>Job, Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the Stars how high they are,</hi> Job 22.12. Thou seest (says he) that the Stars are a Marvellous height, but that Heaven which is God's Habitation, is above the highest Stars: Yea, it is far above them.

the heaven of heavens is of a much Vaster Extent. Well might our Lord say to the Disciples, <hi>In my Father's house there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Mansions.</hi> There is Room enough in that heaven for Thousands of Millions of Saints and Angels to Delight themselves for ever. Yet all this heaven as Vast as it is, will God give for an Inheritance to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. It was said to <hi>Abraham, Lift up thine Eyes, and Look</hi> Northward, <hi>and</hi> South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>and</hi> Eastward, <hi>and</hi> Westward; <hi>all the Land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy Seed after thee,</hi> Gen. 13.14, 15. Thus does the Lord say of the Spiritual Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> true Believers on Jesus Christ, Let them with an Eye of Faith take a View of the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> let them Consider how Good and how Great it is, I will give it all to them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> (1.) A Blessed <hi>Purity</hi> is to be Affirmed of that Heaven in which the
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:039533_0115_10142C5D87EC1380"/>
Believers hope is laid up. It is true that as to the Matter of it, it is a Pure Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. The Purest Gold, the Richest Gems are not to Compare with it; nor is any Earthly thing: But it is a Place of the Greatest Purity on an higher Account, than that of the Matter out of which it does Consist. For it was never Defiled with any Sin; and is therefore called <hi>an Inheritance Undefiled,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4 It is an <hi>holy heaven.</hi> Psal. 20.6. <hi>He will hear from his</hi> holy <hi>heaven; with the saving strength of his right hand.</hi> How should there be Sin there, when there is such a Glorious Presence of God in it? There never was, there never shall be any Sin there. <hi>There shall in no wise enter into it any thing that Defiles,</hi> Rev. 21.27. Then I am sure that Sin cannot enter into it, for that is the defilingest thing that ever was. This Earth was a far more desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble place before Sin entred into it, and brought a Blemish and a Curse upon it, than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For there they will find that Purity which their Souls breathe after. The <hi>holy of holies</hi> in the Temple, was a Type of the <hi>heaven of heavens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Another Property of this heaven is, the <hi>Constancy</hi> of its Nature. It was not made out of Pre-existent Principles, as all things that shall Perish and be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Change were. It was made out of Nothing, as soon as ever the Work of Creation began, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. It was made before the Starry heaven, and before the Earth, which was Created the day before the Sun Moon and Stars were made. For Angels are the Inhabitants of it; and they shouted when they saw God lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Earth, <hi>Job</hi> 38.6, 7. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the same that it was the first Day that the World began, without any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and will do so to all Eternity. It is therefore called an Inheritance which is <hi>Incorruptible,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. In this world, all things are subject to Change: Here is not our Rest. It is not a Place to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in: But heaven is; Heb. 13.14. <hi>Here we have no continuing City, but we seek one
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:039533_0116_10142C5F16CE5D18"/>
to come.</hi> Our Days on Earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding. But in heaven there are <hi>Mansions,</hi> which are <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting habitations,</hi> Luk. 16.9. It is the greatest Folly in the world, for men to think that their houses on Earth shall be continued for Ever; and their dwelling places to all Generations: But Heaven is an eternal house: 2 Cor. 5.1. <hi>We have a building of God, not made with hands, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the heavens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Another Property of this heaven is, a wonderful <hi>Splendor.</hi> A marvellous Clarity and Brightness beyond what is in the most Resplendent Gems. It is called <hi>a Throne of Sapphire-stone,</hi> which shines with a great Brightness, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.26. The Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> had a wonderful Vision: the Son of God appeared to them in an Humane shape: <hi>They saw the God of</hi> Israel, <hi>and there was under his Feet as it were</hi> a <hi>Paved work of Sapphire-stone: and as it were the body of heaven in its c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

not for its heat, but for its light. Hence also resembl'd to a <hi>Jasper</hi> Stone, Rev. 21.11. Writers say of the <hi>Jasper,</hi> that the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it never ceaseth; the Clouds do not darken it, nor does it leave shining when the Sun shines; nor does the splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of it hurt the Eyes; but the more men look on it, the more it pleaseth them. One of our own Divines says truly, <hi>All the Lustre and shining Beauty of Diamonds and Precious Stones, if they could be united into one Object, are not to be compared with this.</hi> The Sun &amp; Stars may be look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which is perfect is come, and that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect is done away.</hi> And then after the Day of Judgment, not only some of the Elect of God, but all of them shall be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in heaven. The Great <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Righteous,</hi> the General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and Church of the First-born will be there, maintaining a Blessed and Sinless Communion, and declaring the great things which God has done for them. There is very little spoken in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, concerning the Providences of God towards the Long-liv'd <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> who Liv'd before the Flood. Without doubt, they had marvellous Experiences of the Goodness of God, and his wonderful Works towards them. It is the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Eminent Divine, that the Story of those things is reserved for Heaven; and there they will have time enough to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare them; and to Praise the Lord in the Great Congregation. And it is hence E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that the Saints in Heaven shall Know one another: Otherwise there would be little comfort in their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They who are Strangers to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:039533_0119_101416F9F3940E48"/>
cannot have an intimacy of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; as in Heaven the Saints shall have. Such as knew them in this world, and have got to heaven before them, will be glad to see them come thither after them; and will give them a Joyful <hi>Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; and in a special manner if they were their <hi>Benefactors</hi> on Earth. Wherefore CHRIST Exhorting his Disciples unto acts of Charity to the poor Servants of God, says, <hi>When you fail, i. e.</hi> when you dy, and cease to be in this world, and all things here shall fail and be of no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to you, <hi>they shall receive you</hi> into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting habitations, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.9. They unto whom you have been Charitable, will receive you with great Joy. As if a man gone into a Far Countrey, shall see his Friend who has been Kind to him come thither after him, he <hi>Receives him</hi> with Joy. Heaven is a Far Countrey: Our Friends to whom we have been Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial, who are arriv'd there before us, will be glad to <hi>Receive us</hi> into their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion there. Especially such as unto whom GOD has made us Spiritual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors.
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:039533_0119_101416F9F3940E48"/>
When a Faithful Minister of Christ shall come to heaven, the Souls there who have been Converted or Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his Ministry, will greatly Rejoyce to see him. I have shew'd from another Scripture, that the Servants of God shall Know one another in the Resurrection World: Yea, such as were not known to them in this world; Nay, Ungodly men shall then know those holy Servants of God who dy'd and went to heaven long before they themselves had a being, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.28. We way from thence Argue, that much more shall Saints in Heaven know one another; yea, such as were in heaven many Ages before them. When our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was Transfigured in the holy Mount, in the presence of three of his Disciples, (which Transfiguration was a little Emblem and Figure of Heaven) there appeared <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> talking with him; and <hi>Peter</hi> knew who they were, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.3, 4. How did he know those who had been in Heaven many Ages? It is a Vanity to say (as some have done) that <hi>Peter</hi> knew them, because he had seen
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:039533_0120_10142C688B9CA030"/>
their Pictures; for the <hi>Jews</hi> did not allow of, nor had they any such Pictures among them. But there was a Divine Irradiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on his Mind, causing him to know who they were. Much more will it be so in Heaven. Then shall we know which of the Saints there is <hi>Moses,</hi> and which is <hi>Joshua,</hi> and which is <hi>Samuel,</hi> and which is <hi>David</hi>; and so of all the rest. The tho't of this was a great Comfort to <hi>Bullinger</hi> when he was on his Death-bed: <hi>I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (says he) <hi>to be with the holy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, and Prophets, and Apostles, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs who are gone to Heaven before me.</hi> It is Reported, that the Night before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Dy'd, some proposed that Question to him, <hi>Whether Saints in heaven shall know one another?</hi> He Answered, that surely it shall be so: For which he gave this (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other) Reasons, <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise knew who <hi>Eve</hi> was, as soon as ever he saw her. Much more will it be so in the Heavenly Paradise.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In Heaven there is an innumerable Company of Angels, with whom we shall there have a Blessed Communion. There
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:039533_0120_10142C688B9CA030"/>
is Joy in Heaven, Joy among the Angels of God over a sinner that Repents, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.10. Then certainly the Angels Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, when they see a Soul come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to joyn with them in Glorifying God there. It is true, that whilest we are in this World, we have a Communion with Angels, more than we know or think of; for it is secret and invisible. As long as we abide in a state of Mortality, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of an Angel is awful and terrible to us. An Angel appear'd to <hi>Samson</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: She knew him not to be an Angel, if she had, she would have been more terrify'd; but she said to her Husband, <hi>A man of God came to me, and his Countenance was like the Countenance of an Angel of God, very terrible,</hi> Judg. 13.6. But in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven we shall be Equal to the <hi>Angels,</hi> as immortal as they are; and therefore ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of holding a Familiar Communion and Conversation with them. The Lord said to the Prophet, <hi>If thou wilt walk in my Ways, I will give thee places to walk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong these that stand by,</hi> Zech. 3.7. Who were they that stood by? They were
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:039533_0121_10142C6CD7813A28"/>
holy Angels. There are blessed Walks in heaven. They that walk in the ways of the Lord here on Earth, shall one Day walk with Angels in those <hi>Celestial walks.</hi> There shall we be as Familiar with holy Angels, as <hi>Fellow-servants</hi> can be with one another. When <hi>John</hi> fell at the Feet of an Angel to Worship him, he Charg'd him, Do it not; <hi>I am thy Fellow-servant</hi>: For Fellow-servants to Worship one another, is most Unreasonable, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10. Now this is a great happiness. Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> (he that suffer'd Martyrdom in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> Days) Blessed God for sending him to Prison, because there (said he) <hi>I became acquainted with that Angel of God, Mr.</hi> John Bradford. A Very Holy Man, is an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel Incarnate.</hi> If it is an happiness to have Communion with an Angelical Man, tho' in a Prison, what is it to Converse with Angels, who have not (nor ever had) any Sin in them; and this Conversation not in a Prison, but in the Heavenly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise? There they will inform us, what Services they have done for the Church of God, by the Direction of our Lord
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:039533_0121_10142C6CD7813A28"/>
Jesus Christ; who is their Lord as well as ours: And what Kind Offices they have done for us, which now we know nothing of; so shall we Joyn with Angels, and they with us in <hi>Eternal Hallelujahs,</hi> to GOD and to JESUS CHRIST. Then shall we see that Scripture Blessedly Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, Rev. 5.13. <hi>Every Creature in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, heard I, saying, Blessing, Honour, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Power be unto him that sitteth on the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Saints in Heaven shall have a Blessed Communion with One, who is better than any Saint on Earth or Angel in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that is with JESUS CHRIST. It was a blessed word which Christ spake to the Disciples, Joh. 14.2, 3. <hi>There are many Mansions in my Father's House; I go to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a Place for you,; and if I go and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a Place for you, I will come again and receive you to my self, that where I am, there you may be also.</hi> When He has them with him in his Father's House, there will be a Ravishing Communion between them. The Apostles were singularly happy, in
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:039533_0122_10142C7192BC47A8"/>
that they were admitted to a Free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation with Christ, when in his state of Humiliation here on Earth. It was said to them, <hi>Blessed are your Eyes, for they see that which many Prophets &amp; Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous men have desired to see, but have not seen them,</hi> Mat. 13.16, 17. But how great is their Blessedness, who see Christ in Glory; and Converse with him there? Notwithstanding he is Exalted far above all Angels and Men, He Condescends to Entertain a Communion with his Saints in Heaven as his Brethren. When <hi>Joseph</hi> was in all his Glory, he Comforted his Brethren, and spoke Kindly to them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.21. Christ will speak nothing to his Saints in Heaven, but what shall be Kind and Comfortable. When he was Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured, there appeared Glorify'd men <hi>talking with him,</hi> Luk. 9.30. What Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications there are and shall be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ and the Glorified, We know not; nor shall we until we are among them. But we know, that they have a Blessed Fellowship with the Son of God in Heaven; and that a very great part o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="235" facs="unknown:039533_0122_10142C7192BC47A8"/>
their Happiness does consist in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. It is Heaven to be with Christ. The happiness of heaven is thus Expressed by our Saviour himself; Joh. 17.24. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will that they whom thou hast Given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my Glory.</hi> The Humane Nature of Christ, in which dwells the Fulness of the Godhead Bodily, is as full of God as it is possible for a Creature to be. There is more of God to be seen in that Man, than in all the Creatures in Heaven or Earth. <hi>The Man Christ Jesus,</hi> is the most Glorious Object that Eyes can behold. It is Christ's being there, that makes Heaven to be Heaven indeed. Believers who Dy'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Testament were in a blessed Estate, Nevertheless, when the Man Christ Jesus Ascended to <hi>Heaven,</hi> his coming there was a great Addition to their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. His Presence filled heaven with a New Glory, beyond what Glorify'd Souls had seen before that Day. It is Christ's being there, that makes heaven to be so desirable. The Apostle therefore said, <hi>I desire to depart, and to be with Christ,</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="unknown:039533_0123_10142C733491FE18"/>
Phil. 1.23. He does not say, I desire to depart that I may be in Heaven; but that I may be with Christ. To be with Christ is better than to be in Heaven without Him.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>The Perfection of Blessedness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in Seeing</hi> GOD. It is so Expressed in the Scripture, Heb. 12.14. <hi>Follow Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, without which no man shall see the Lord.</hi> All the Blessedness of Heaven is denoted by that, of <hi>Seeing the Lord.</hi> The Glorify'd have a clear and immediate Sight of GOD. They do not see him through the Glass of his Word &amp; Works as is in this World they do; but have an Open, Clear, Full Sight of him; 1 Cor. 13.12. <hi>Now we see through a Glass Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but then Face to Face: Now I know in part, but then shall I know even as I am known.</hi> Here we have but a Dark and Very Imperfect Knowledge of God. Both the Object and our Eyes are covered with Darkness; but in heaven that Darkness is Removed, so that we see clearly; as two men who are near together &amp; behold one
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:039533_0123_10142C733491FE18"/>
another Face to Face. In this Life, our sight of God is by Faith: <hi>We Walk by Faith, and not by Sight</hi>; But in heaven there is an immediate Vision and Fruition of him. Not that in heaven God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is seen with Bodily Eyes. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature cannot be seen: He is the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible God,</hi> whom no man has seen nor can see, as to a Corporeal Vision. But <hi>Mental Knowledge</hi> is in the Scripture Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by <hi>Vision.</hi> It is an Intellectual Vision of GOD which Saints in Glory are Blessed with: He is <hi>seen with the Eye of the Understanding.</hi> Not that the Blessed have a <hi>Comprehensive Vision</hi> or <hi>Knowledge</hi> of GOD. No Creature can Comprehend the Incomprehensible Being of GOD. Finite has no proportion to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite. Therefore no Finite Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can have a Perfect Knowledge of the Infinite Being: Job 11.7. <hi>Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty to Perfection</hi>? No Creature can ever do it. Nevertheless, there is an <hi>Intellectual Knowledge</hi> of God, in which the <hi>Essence</hi> of Happiness does consist:
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:039533_0124_10142C75A6A278F0"/>
This all the Blessed have. <hi>Blessed are the Pure in Heart, for they shall see God,</hi> Mat. 5 8. As to the Degree and Measure of this Vision, it is according to the Pleasure of God, who will doubtless Vouchsafe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Manifestations of himself to some Saints in <hi>Heaven</hi> than to Others, (as he does on <hi>Earth</hi>) according to the Soveraign Good Pleasure of his Will. But such a <hi>Vision of God</hi> all the Glorify'd shall have, as will make them happy. And nothing short of that can make the Rational Creature hap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

attended with that <hi>Happiness.</hi> An <hi>Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of Sinning</hi> in the Man Christ Jesus, proceeds from the Personal Union of the Humane Nature with the Divine.

III. <hi>Believers on Christ should be Very willing to Dy and leave this World, so they may Enjoy that Hope which is laid up for them in Heaven.</hi> When ever God calls them to it, they should Dy willingly. Indeed, there are but few men who Leave this World willingly. Their Souls are Forc'd out of their Body's, full sore against their wills. Tis with them as it was said of the Enemies of <hi>David, Their Souls are slung out, as out of the middle of a Sling,</hi> 1 Sam. 25.29. Or, as it was said of the Rich Fool, <hi>Thy Soul shall be Required of thee,</hi> Luk. 12.20. Death comes upon them like an unwelcome Bailiff, and drags their Souls out of their Bodies. It may not be so with Believers on Christ: They should Dy with a Good will. 2 Cor. 5.8. <hi>We are willing to be absent from the Body.</hi> For certainly <hi>Death,</hi> how ever it has been their Enemy, is now their Good Friend: The Day of their Death will be a better Day to them, than the Day of their Birth. Why then should they be afraid or unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to bid it welcome? There are holy Men spoken of in the Scripture, who were
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:039533_0131_10142C85EACE5FC0"/>
Very willing to Dy, and go out of this sorrowful sinful World. <hi>Abraham</hi> was so He was <hi>full of Days</hi> , Gen. 25.8. Said to be so, not only in that he Liv'd to a good Old Age, but he was weary of the World: he had had <hi>his Full</hi> of it; and was desirous to be gone to a Better; that is to an Heavenly Countrey. <hi>Jacob</hi> was willing to Dy: he said to <hi>Joseph, Now let me Dy,</hi> Gen. 46.30. The like we see in <hi>Simeon</hi>; he said, <hi>Lord, Now lettest thou thy Servant Depart in Peace,</hi> Luk. 2.29. The Apostle <hi>Paul Desired to depart &amp; to be with Christ,</hi> Phil. 1.23.

                  </gap> Examples, (besides those in the Scripture) of Good Men unto whom Death has been very welcome. He that Reads the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Martyrs, will see how willing they were to Dy, that so they might go to Christ. They were afraid of nothing so much, as lest their Persecutors would let them Escape, and not take their Lives from them, when they offered themselves to Death for the Name of Christ: They Rather Erred in too much Forwardness, than in too much Backwardness to part
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:039533_0131_10142C85EACE5FC0"/>
with their Lives, which they did <hi>not Love unto the Death</hi>Â· I could tell you of many holy Servants of Christ in these Latter Ages, who notwithstanding they were <hi>Contented to Live, Desired rather to Dy:</hi> When Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> had been dangerously Sick, but the Physician told him, that now there was hopes of his Recovery; he Reply'd,
<q>You think by what you say to Comfort me: But you make my heart Sad. It is as if you should tell one that has been sore Weather-beaten at Sea, and hoped that he was come to the End of his Wearisome Voyage, that he must go back again.</q>
Mr. <hi>Edward Deering,</hi> said to his Friends, <hi>If I were put to my Choice, whether I would Dy or Live, if it may stand with the holy Will of God, I would a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times rather Chuse to Dy &amp; go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, than to Continue Longer in this Evil World.</hi> The Servants of God have at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the more Reason to be willing to Dy, for that the <hi>Days are Evil</hi>; and they are like to be worse. Tis true, that Happy Times are coming; but the way will be made for them, by Terrible things in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:039533_0132_10142C8A0DA7F0F0"/>
The World must be more Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, before the Good Times come. The Learned and Noble <hi>Monsieur du Plessis,</hi> not long before his Death, thus Expressed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>I have indeed Desired to Live, that I might see the Deliverance of the Church, but seeing no Amendment in the World; I see nothing that should invite me to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in it.</hi> Nay, Christians should not only be willing to Exchange Earth for Heaven, but they should Long for the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Day: 2 Pet. 3.12. <hi>Looking for, &amp; hasting to the Coming of the Day of God.</hi> When we think the Time Long until it comes, we hasten to it. For this Believers should Groan Earnestly, desiring to be Cloathed upon with their House which is from Heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. That Famous <hi>German</hi> Divine <hi>Bucholtzer,</hi> in his Old Age writing to a Friend, tells him, <hi>That he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired nothing in this World so much, as the Happy Hour of his Death.</hi>

Narrow is the Way which leads unto Life, and <hi>Few there be that find it;</hi> The Son of God Himself has so declared, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.14. It has ever been thus in all past Ages, that but few have gone to Heaven. The Old World before the Flood must needs be very full of People, because of the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gevity</hi> of those <hi>Patriarchs.</hi> If <hi>Jacob</hi> after the Flood had Lived four hundred years, he must have seen some Millions of his Posterity: but the first Patriarchs Lived some of them almost a thousand years; whence we conclude, that many Millions of Souls perished in that Universal deluge;

but how few Godly Souls were there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them? The Apostle calls them, <hi>The World of the Ungodly,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.5. When the Children of Israel came out of Egypt, they were Six hundred thousand fit for War: yet but two of them entred into Canaan. One of the Ancients observes, that as the Land of Canaan was a Type of Heaven, so that those two were a Type of the Small Number of Persons that shall enter into the Kingdom of HeavenÂ· Is it not said in the Prophet, <hi>I will take you One of a City, and Two of a Family,</hi> or Tribe, Jer. 3.14.

               <p>Consider, 4. <hi>Many are deceived with False Hopes, until it is too late for them to mend their Error.</hi> Their Souls drop into Hell, with a Confident but Groundless Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of going to Heaven. Thus it was with the Scribes and Pharisees: They thought they should go to Heaven. They <hi>Trusted to themselves that they were Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> Luk. 18.9. They knew that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous men shall go to Heaven when they dye, and they supposed themselves to be such: yet Christ told them, That they could not escape the Damnation of Hell, <hi>Math.</hi> 23.33. And he said to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Math. 5.20. <hi>Except your Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness shall exceed the Righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Alas!

a field which grow until they dye. We should therefore be diligent in improving Means of Grace in order unto growth<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> The Word of God is appointed as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, not only to begin a work of Grace but to increase it. 1 Pet. 2.2. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the sincere Milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby.</hi> And the Lord does often proportion measures of Grace, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mens diligence in attending to his Word. Tis said, <hi>Take heed how you hear; for to him that has, shall be given.</hi> Luk. 8.18. They that have the Grace to make a due improvement of their hearing the Word, shall have more Grace given to them. The <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is instituted, not to begin but to strengthen the work of Grace where it is begun. And when Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers draw nigh unto God in that holy Ordinance, with due Preparation for it, they will surely grow in Grace thereby. For in that Ordinance in a special manner, they <hi>Behold as in a glass the Glory of the Lord, and are changed into the same image from Glory to Glory,</hi> i. e. from one degree of Grace unto another, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us be Fruitful in Good Works.</hi> Growing in Grace, &amp; Abounding in Good Works is making hast to Heaven. When men remove from one Place to another, they use to send their Goods before them. It has been well observed by a Pious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, that when Jacob returned to his own Country, he sent his droves before him, and he followed after. Thus should we send droves of Duties &amp; Good Works both of Piety and Charity to go before us to the heavenly Country, which if we are true Believers on Christ, is our own Country, and we shall e're long follow. By this we lay up for our selves Treasure in Heaven. Let us then do all the Good we can whilest we are on the Earth. And there will be a double blessed consequent of it, One is that we shall be the sooner in Heaven. For if we make hast in doing Good Works, the sooner shall we come to the End of our Works, and then we shall be in Heaven, whither our Works as to
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:039533_0141_10142CA02FA65188"/>
the blessed reward of them will follow us. Blessed are the Dead which dye in the Lord, they cease from their Labours and their Works follow them. Our Saviour Christ said to God, <hi>I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do: and now, O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, glorify me with thy self,</hi> Joh. 17, 4, 5. So when the Believer has finished his work, he shall be glorifyed in Heaven, and if he abounds therein, he will soon have finished it. And then another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent is, that the greater will the Glory be when we shall come there. For Christ has said, That He will give to every Man according as his Work shall be. By a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in Good Works, we Obtain a Bill of Exchange for <hi>Heaven,</hi> which will be accepted by the Faithful and Glorious Pay Master. 1 Tim. 6.18, 19. <hi>Be rich in good Works, laying up in Store for themselves a Good Foundation,</hi> (a sure Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is a good foundation) <hi>against the time to come, that they may lay hold on Eternal Life.</hi>

So it has been oft-times, not only with Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men; but with Saints of God, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Ones too. Yea, some of them have with an humble Submission to the Will of God, Desired and Prayed for such a Death. To be sure, there is no Rule in the Scripture to Pray against it; as some do. It is surely a great Favour of God, to have a Quick and an Easie Passage into his Heavenly Kingdom. Our Care and Endeavour should then be, that if the Lord should Call for us Suddenly, we may be Ready to go at the first Call: That when he shall send the Messenger of Death for us, we may be Ready to go at the <hi>first Knock:</hi> Luk. 12.35, 36. <hi>Let your Loi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>s be Girded about</hi>; so it is with men that are ready to go: <hi>And you your selves like unto men that Wait for their Lord<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that when he Comes and Knocks<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> they may

Open to him immediately.</hi> It's a sad thing when Death comes Suddenly, for a man to think, There is such a thing, and such a thing, which if I had thought I should have Died, I would have done; but it has been neglected, and now I am uncapable of performing it. It is therefore a Duty and good Prudence, for a man always to have a Testamentary Disposal of his Worldly Estate in Readiness by him; lest a Sudden Death should make him Dye Intestate; which it may be he would be loth to do. The Prophet said to <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah, Set thine House in Order</hi>: i. e. Make thy Will; <hi>for thou shalt Dye,</hi> Isa. 38.1. The neglect of this Duty has been an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, which many Good men have been found Faulty in; and which has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned a great deal of Trouble and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion in their Families, when they have been gone out of the World. But especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and above all; our Care should be to set our Souls in Order; that nothing is left Undone in matters wherein our Souls are Concerned: That if Death should come Suddenly, there may not be a Cry

as with some it has been, <hi>My Time is done, but my Work is not done, nor well begun nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Let us be able to say, My Peace is made with God, I am in Christ; I know not of any one Sin that ever I was guilty of in my Life, but I have Unfeignedly Repented of it. Then welcome Death, welcome Heaven.</p>
               <p>Therefore,</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>If we would be in a Readiness for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, our Care should be to Walk Closely with GOD.</hi> Let us beware of Blotting our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences for Heaven, by giving way to Temptation <hi>at any Time</hi>: Luk. 21.34. <hi>Take heed to your selves,</hi> lest at any Time, <hi>your Hearts be Overcharged with Surfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Drunkenness, and Cares of this Life.</hi> A Christian should <hi>Live every Day as if it were his Last Day:</hi> The meaning of which is not, that he should do just those things, &amp; none other than what he would do, if he knew he should Dy the next Day: But he should be as Careful not to Mispend his Time, and not to Commit any Sin against God; or Delay the Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

if he were this Day to give his Account to God, what he has done, and how he spent his Days on Earth. We should Live in a continual Expectation of our being called out of This, into the Eternal World. So did <hi>Job; All the Days of my Appointed Time, will I wait until my Change shall come.</hi> We shall soon be gone out of this Evil World; we know not how soon: The sooner the better, if so be the Will of GOD. In the mean time, we should Live Watching, and Waiting, and Praying, and Seeking, and Hoping: <hi>For here have we no Continuing City; but we Seek One to Come.</hi> Our Souls within us should say, <hi>Come Lord Jesus, Come Quickly.</hi> Come and Receive us to thy Self; that where thou art we may be also, in the Mansions which thou hast Prepared for us, in thy Father's House. <hi>Amen,</hi> LORD JESUS, <hi>Even so be it, Come Quickly.</hi>
