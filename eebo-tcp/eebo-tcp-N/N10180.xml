            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I FRANCIS BURDETT PERSONEL, was born in Ireland, tenderly raiſed by careful and induſtrious parents, who took all care imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of me in my education. Tho' eight years ſchooling were laid out upon me, I did not improve it, ſo as to anſwer the deſign of my parents, they find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I had not ſo much learning as they expected I might have had in that time, bound me an apprentice, according to my own deſire, to a good trade: When maſter of my trade I went to England; but on my voyage thither, put into Wales, went from thence to Briſtol, in England, tarried there ſome time, and went from thence to Shepton-Mallet, in Somerſetſhire, where I alſo abode a conſiderable while, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by all who knew me for my ſober deportment. My mother hearing where I was, continually impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned me, by letters, to come home; which I accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly did. My father being now dead, I began to be very careful about worldly affairs, and was remarkably ſober; yet, my mother being a paſſionate woman, could never be content with me; do what I could, I might have done it better. She often ſaid to others, that being an only child, ſhe loved me beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; yet it grieved me that ſhe was of ſuch a tomper. I now became acquainted with a young man, who knew her temper, and deſired me to go with him to a frolic; which I accordingly did: He eſpied a
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012936_0003_0F903F430CB6AB50"/>
young woman walking along, whom he knew; he ſpake to her, and deſired her to go with us to take a glaſs of liquor, which ſhe did, and was in company with us, till it was ſo late, that I dreaded to go home. She was the firſt lewd woman I was ever in company with: But ſin and Satan ſtrove ſo much with me, that I left my mother's houſe to be at liberty. While from under her eye, I was guilty of pleaſing the ſinful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites of the fleſh many times; ſhe hearing of me, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reſted, till ſhe got me home again. I then lived with her ſix or eight months; but ſoon growing weary of her continual admonitions, was reſolved to get out of her reach: Accordingly, came to Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, where I ſtaid eighteen months; I then returned to Ireland, was very much diſtreſſed when I got home, and was reſolved never to leave home again. I came to my mother in a poor and miſerable condition; but ſhe received me tenderly, and kept me concealed, leſt the neighbours ſhould ſee me before ſhe had provided cloathing for me. I then lived with her one year very comfortably; but, ſhe fearing that I would leave her again, adviſed me to marry: I was glad of this propoſal, and ſaid, if ſhe was willing, I would ſeek me a wife as ſoon as poſſible; ſhe anſwered, ſhe had one already provided, of an honeſt family, who had ſeven ſiſters already married to creditable men, and that none of the family ever had the leaſt blemiſh in their characters; ſhe ſaid, that the one ſhe had provided for <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, was the youngeſt, and I might get a handſome dowry with her: I aſked her name; when I heard who ſhe was, I ſaid I muſt have ſome time to think of it, (not that ever I deſigned to have her) but was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to put my mother in a paſſion: She ſaid, I might have time to make love to her, but have her I muſt, or never be a penny the better at her death. Thinking the young woman not handſome enough, nor ſin eying her in the leaſt, knowing myſelf to be but young, I reſolved not to have her, let what would <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> My mother was at me day after day to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012936_0004_0F903F43DF9B85B0"/>
have her, but to no purpoſe. Being rid of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity by the young woman's being married to another; through diſobedience I came off to Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca a ſecond time, and have never ſince returned. I lived in Baltimore county, in Maryland, for eighteen months, as a ſervant, and ſerved but ſo much of four years due for my paſſage. Being now in want of clothes, as thoſe I brought from home were wore out, and thoſe I had of my maſter but indifferent, though far better than what other ſervants got for common. At length, I took a thought to run away, and accordingly did in a fooliſh manner; one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after breakfaſt, my maſter came home, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me what was to be done; I worked a little after his departure, then took my ax with me, went about a mile through the woods, and ſeated myſelf on the top of a hill till night, it being then the ſpring of the year, though the trees were not yet green. I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled that night but ſlowly, my ſhoes being bad and the roads very deep, as it had rained. I got within a mile of Baltimore by day-light, and then, for fear of being diſcovered, went and laid me down in the woods; but, having only a ſhirt, jacket, and a pair of trowſers upon me, and it raining very much, I could not ſleep, being cold, wet and hungry. I now repented of my running away, and would have returned home, had I not recollected that I had heard my maſter ſay, he would treat a runaway that returned, worſe than one that uſed his endeavour to get off; therefore, I would not go home, nor tell that I was a runaway, but wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be taken up; and, with an expectation of being taken, came on the high road at mid-day, and went into Baltimore Town. As nobody queſtioned me, I enquired for a certain tavern, where I had heard my maſter ſay he uſed to put up at; coming there, I mentioned my maſter's name, and ſaid, that he deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to get a dinner there; the landlord aſked me if my maſter had given me a note. I ſaid, no: Then ſaid he, I cannot let you have dinner. I wiſhed to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012936_0005_0F903F448207C680"/>
be taken up, yet would not inform him I was a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away.</p>
            <p>I then walked through the town, and came to a road that leads to Annapolis, I reached the river by ſun-ſet, where I waited till two Gentlemen came who wanted to get over; they aſked me to whom I belong? I ſaid to Squire Carroll of Annopolis, which was falſe; but he living in Annapolis, and I wanting to get there if poſſible: They examined me no farther, knowing that whom I called my maſter had ſeveral farms, and his ſervants continually going from one to another: I travelled with this lie in my mouth till I came to Annapolis; it was evening when I came to town, and I had neither money, friends, nor clothes, I walked about hoping ſomebody would take me up, but nobody noticed me. Going to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's houſe, I laid me down under the ſtoop, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſome one from within would examine me, but there came none. The next morning I walked out of town very feeble and hungry not having eat for a long time. I then wandered I know not where, ſteering partly by the ſun, travelled by day on the high road, caring not much whether I was then taken up or no, but was reſolved to keep going whilſt I was able. I met ſeveral people, and ſaluted them, and ſo paſſed on: At length, I ſaw a Gentleman on horſeback coming towards me, which daunted me, fearing he was in purſuit of me, I ſaluted him, paſſed on, and ſometime after met his brother, who queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned me: I told him I was juſt free, and my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſuch a villain, that he would not give me my freedom dues, and that I came to Annapolis, in ſearch of a friend, to acquaint him how my maſter ſerved me. But unhappily, I told him, my friend had left town before I came, and having no money I left town, with an intent to get work in the country; he replied his brother wanted a workman but could get none this while paſt, therefore, deſired me to call at his brother's houſe, told me his name, and gave
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012936_0006_0F903F46F93C09E0"/>
proper directions, and deſired me to tarry there till his brother came home, where I went, and ſpoke to the Gentlewoman, who ordered me a dinner, which was very welcome to me juſt then: When the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman came home, I engaged with him for four months under the name of James Alkins, having been with him a week or two, pleaſing him, being handy at any ſort of plantation work, he let me have neceſſary apparel; with him I lived till after harveſt, but he not letting me have my earnings, leſt I ſhould leave him before my time was expired, and I fearing my maſter would hear of me, borrowed a coat, hat, and other neceſſaries ſuitable, under a pretence of viſiting a friend, and went off, being provided with a paſs I had written myſelf, and ſigned a Magiſtrate's name to it, changing my name to Patt Percy; having now ſome money, I delayed not till I got into Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia; and, being well dreſſed, could write a paſſible hand, and underſtood ſome figures, I ſet up for a Schoolmaſter, accordingly I got a ſchool, where I taught for ſome time, was very well regarded by my neighbours, ſome gave me credit for one thing and ſome for another. I lived very happy, as I thought, juſt then, and could go out on a evening after ſchool and ſerve the devil with delight. I continued this practice for ſome time, till I went to hear the Baptiſts called by ſome New Lights. I went more out of curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity then any thing elſe, having heard much of them: The firſt ſermon I heard pricked my heart. I went to hear them often, wreſtled againſt ſin in a meaſure, and would not commit ſuch as appeared baſe in the world, and as few others as poſſible.</p>
            <p>I had a deſire to leave off all fin; but depended on the broken ſtaff of my own ſtrength, therefore could not do it: I obtained the name of being a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious young man by ſome, who knew not what it was; and I myſelf was deceived, thinking I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted when only convicted, and wanted to join the church, but was not accepted, upon which the young
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012936_0007_0F903F480CE19B80"/>
men derided me: yet I continued to hear preaeching, and, to appearance, had I ſtaid there, ſhould have been brought to the knowledge of God through Chriſt: But two men, who ſuſpected me to be a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away, ſaying they would take me up, occaſioned my leaving this place, being unwilling to return to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryland to my maſter. I went to a widow, whom I was bound in oath to be married unto, borrowed a mare, bridle and ſaddle of her, under a pretence to go to town for ſome things; from whence I went, calling myſelf Francis Perſonel, <hi>alias</hi> Burdett Perſonel, and never returned. About an hundred miles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from I ſold the mare, bridle and ſaddle, and travelled to Pittſburg, nigh which I tarried ſometime.</p>
            <p>Thus you may ſee I have been a hypocrite, and what ſin have I not committed, except the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt? And, I may thank God for reſtraining me by his grace from that, for my heart was bad enough.</p>

               <note n="*" place="bottom">For ſome tranſactions prior to this time, not in his MS. ſee a note, marked (<hi>a</hi>) at the end.</note> After I came to New-York, I took a wife; and notwithſtanding I knew ſhe had followed a looſe way of life, I loved her. In ſhort the next morning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had been married and beded to her, I conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her going to her old habitation, till ſhe could pay ſome debts which ſhe ſaid ſhe owed, and for which otherwiſe I would be ſued, but ſhe could pay them very ſoon: She was not long there before I took her away, as I could not bear to think of her follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that courſe any longer. I did not let her want whilſt I was able to work, and could get it to do; but, unfortunately, I had not been long married before I was taken ſo ill, as to be unable to work; and, as we ſaw no other way, rather than be beholden to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we lived with, we concluded unanimouſly, that we muſt either pariſh, or ſhe take to her old courſe; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, ſhe proſtituted her body as uſual. The firſt night ſhe went on this occaſion, ſhe returned ſomewhat
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012936_0008_0F903F4855635F50"/>
cheerful, and ſaid ſhe had met with a young woman that lent her ſome money, and declared ſhe had no converſation with any man that night. I anſwered, it was no matter if ſhe had, I would never tell her of it. Next night ſhe went and brought home ſome caſh, which ſhe ſaid was lent her in like manner. Sometime after I was ill, ſhe went out every night ſhe could, to which I ſtill encouraged her, even ſo much as to go with her ſome nights part of the way, and would paſs the evening at ſome neighbour's houſe till nine or ten o'clock, then meet her at the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and come home, as though we had been to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all the time we were out. This abominable practice we followed until the 16th of May, when I went to her father's, not expecting to return that night, neither did ſhe expect me, according to her own confeſſion, otherwiſe ſhe would not have ſtaid out ſo late. Upon my coming home that night, I ſat down contentedly, knowing what ſhe was after. I waited for her till after nine o'clook, and ſhe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, I propoſed to go to bed; and my landlady ſaid ſhe would lock the doors. As I was unwilling ſhe ſhould he ſhut out all night, I ſaid to my landlady, if ſhe would ſit up fifteen minutes, I would go and ſee if I could find her; but if I did not return in that ſpace ſhe might ſhut the doors and go to bed. I went in queſt of her, and came to the houſe where ſhe was, and notwithſtanding that ſhe was there, as I learnt by hearing her laugh, ſhe was denied to be there; and, as I was going out of the houſe, through the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I heard her ſpeak in a room, the door being ſhut; going to the room widow, I heard two Gentlemen ſpeak, but knew not who they were at that time: Mr. Gl—r came out of the room and returned in about fifteen minutes, after which they ſhortly came out, as I was ſtanding near the room window. I expected that the Gentlemen would depart from her, and then intended to go home with her; but the Gentlemen took her one by the one arm, and the other by the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012936_0009_0F903F4904894140"/>
other arm, and ſo went away. It is not eaſy for me to relate how I felt. As I had given her liberty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time to act in ſuch a manner, according to the proverb, <hi>What the eye don't ſee the heart don't grieve at</hi> yet, I confeſs, I had no right to meddle with the Gentlemen; but the devil whom I faithfully ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that time, drew near and tempted me to get a weapon, making me believe if I could ſtrike one or both of them and take away my wife it would appear in the eyes of ſome of my neighbours that I was an honeſt man, and innocent of her doings; with this reſolution I went into the houſe where they had been, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other weapon, unfortunately took the wooden bar of the door, and having purſued and overtaken them, made a blow which ſtruck Mr. Robert W—to on his head, and by it he fell to the ground. My wife ran off: Upon recovering the weapon to defend my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Mr. Gl—r encloſed me, letting the bar fall to the ground. I fought with my hands After a ſhort combat; Mr. Gl—r begged his life; I ſaid it was granted: Whereupon he aſked me, why I had had ſtruck Mr. Wh—te? For being in company with my wife, in a bad houſe at an unſeaſonable hour, ſaid I: Upon my honour ſaid he, I had no connection with her, nor have I reaſon to believe that Mr. Wh—te had? I replied, if they were innocent I was ſorry that I ſtruck them. In the fray I loſt my hat, and ſo did Mr. Gl—r his. While ſeeking for them, I conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as Mr. Wh—te did not ſtir, that he might be dangerouſly wounded; therefore, finding Mr. Gl—r's hat and my own, and ſeeing ſome people approach, I made immediately off with them both. I was at home ſome time before my wife came, and told my landlady what happened, in order to make her believe that I was innocent of what my wife followed. I went to bed that might, and after riſing in the morning, took Mr. Gl—r's hat, and give it to a neighbour to keep, where I ſuppoſe it remains<note n="*" place="bottom">The account of his purſuit and apprehenſion, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in not (<hi>b</hi>) at the end, is not in his MS.</note>.</p>

Herein God is glorified for putting a ſtop to the ſinful courſe that my wife and I followed, (as it was altogether abominable in his ſight, who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity) by detecting, apprehending and executing of me; for though I did not intend to kill Mr. White, when I ſtruck him; yet, as it proved the cauſe of his death, I confeſs I am guilty of the murder of him, inaſmuch as I had given my wife the liberty before-mentioned. Some people have ſaid, that it was a made up thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my wife and me; but it is falſe, neither do I blame her in the leaſt, as I am the ſinful wretch, and really guilty, and none elſe: Why then ſhould I ſtrive to conceal that from the world, which is well known unto God?</p>
            <p>Thus you may read how great a ſinner I have been. I have provoked God times without number, procured his wrath daily, ſerved the Devil faithfully, deſerved nothing, had I my deſerts, but everlaſting damnation; ſeveral other heinous, ſoul damning ſins have I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, which are not here mentioned; and yet, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſerving the Devil ſo long, having been guilty of ſo many crimes of the deepeſt dye, yet God was pleaſed to draw me from the mouth of the pit, to pluck me out of everlaſting burnings, and to receive me even at the eleventh hour, and to give me the knowledge of himſelf in and through Jeſus Chriſt. Oh! the riches of the free grace of God to ſuch a ſinful wretch as I am, as I ſhall endeavour to make appear as well as I am able, being aſſiſted by the grace of God. The laſt day of July I received ſentence of death; I knowing that I was then out of Chriſt, prayed for a long day for repentance, and ſix weeks were granted me. Certainly, if I had been put to death at that time, I ſhould have been a loſt ſoul, for my conſcience was a hell to me, and witneſſed againſt me: I then ſaw hell open, as it were, to receive me, and could then ſee no way of eſcape, for I was almoſt in deſpair, and was in dread that the holy Spirit of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012936_0011_0F903F4A89494608"/>
God was withdrawn from me, never more to return. The condition I was then in I am unable to expreſs. I came to priſon, was put in the condemned room, where I ſat very melancholy, and expected ſome of the Clergy to come and ſee me. I ſent for a Divine of the Church of England, but he did not come juſt then. I then ſent for Mr. Pilmore, a Methodiſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, but he did not come that day, which made me almoſt think that I was forſaken of God and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters too. I was adviſed to ſend for Mr. L—le—d, a Methodiſt; I accordingly did: He came, with two others, and adviſed me much; I declared that I was a great ſinner, and that I had tranſgreſſed God's holy laws, deſpiſed his counſels, and grieved his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and was not worthy to take his holy name into my polluted lips: He counſelled me not to deſpair, and made mention of ſeveral great ſinners whom the Lord had made monuments of his mercy, which are record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the holy Scriptures. He came three or four times, adviſed me much, prayed and ſung whenever he came, and I muſt ſay, the Lord was pleaſed to make him an inſtrument in his hands, of ſome good to me. Perhaps, the reader will be glad to know how I was delivered from the fear of hell: It was done in ſo ſhort a time, that I can ſcarce tell; this I know, I prayed earneſtly to God, after I was awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and alarmed, that he would be pleaſed to pluck me as a brand from the burning: The Lord ſhewed me the danger I was in, the follies and madneſs of my paſt life, in living ſo many years without God in the world, he was pleaſed to ſhew me that I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curſe of a broken law, and that if I departed this life, without an intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, that I muſt be eternally loſt; therefore, ſeeing Chriſt the Saviour, and none elſe, I prayed him to be merciful to me for his own Name's ſake, plead his own moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes, which he hath left on record, deſired him to ſave me, elſe I pariſh, importuning him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly until he was pleaſed to hear me and grant my
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012936_0012_0F903F4B53DAF648"/>
requeſts. The firſt mark or inſtance I had of it, was this, my troubled conſcience was at eaſe, my ſlaviſh fears were taken away; I now no more dreaded hell; Chriſt Jeſus was altogether lovely to me: I could ſee that my ſins crucifyed him, which grieved me: My impriſonment, my death, and the puniſhment due to ſin did not move me; now nothing troubled me, but the thought of having offended ſo good a God ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as I had done. The Lord was pleaſed to give me ſo much of his divine preſence, that I was ſo lifted up, that I thought it was all well, imagining that I was quite out of danger, I almoſt forgot how nigh I was to everlaſting damnation; but the Lord being willing to let me ſee and know that of myſelf I was nothing, permitted Satan to tempt me, I being a poor weak creature when left to myſelf, and not calling on the Lord to aſſiſt me, was ſoon overcome; after Satan got that advantage of me, I was caſt down ſo low that he made me believe all my former peace was a delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; I was between hope and deſpair, was in dread to pray, leſt it ſhould be an abomination to the Lord; at this time Mr. L—le—d came into the room, and was inſtrumental in leading me to prayer.</p>

               <head>TO THE PUBLIC.</head>
               <p>GOOD people and bad: But, Why did I ſay good? There is none good, no not one. Whatever you are, whither rich or poor, learned or not, that read this, be aſſured that you muſt taſte death as well as I, and in a ſhort ſpace of time. Your delicate bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies muſt be meat for worms, muſt lay rotting in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption as well as mine. You are all certain of death, but uncertain when you muſt die; and there is nothing more ſure, than that you muſt appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgment-ſeat of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to give an account of the deeds done in the body. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore, that all this is true, there are three things which ſhould make a ſinner, out of Chriſt trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: The firſt is, When the ſoul is to depart from his body. The ſecond, When it is to appear before God to receive judgment: And the third, When ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is pronounced. Oh! how terrible then will death be to a ſinner. O dreadful moment, which cuts the thread of time, and begins the web of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. It is not the moſt terrible conſequence of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012936_0014_0F903F4F681E91A0"/>
death, to leave this world; but it is, to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our actions unto the Creator of the world, eſpecially in ſuch a time, when you cannot look for mercy. The thoughts of appearing before a holy God, made even Job tremble, who was ſo juſt, that the Almighty himſelf rejoiced in having ſuch a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. If Job trembled, then, methinks, ſinners out of Chriſt, have greater cauſe to tremble; for, if they depart out of this life in an unconverted ſtate, how will it amaze them, to behold the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf alive; not a dead image, nor in that ſtate of humiliation when he ſuffered on the croſs; but upon a throne of majeſty, and ſeat of juſtice: Not in a time of mercy, but in the hour of vengeance: Not naked, tho' with pierced hands, but armed againſt ſinners with the ſword of juſtice, when he will come to judge and revenge the injuries which they have done him: God is as righteous in his juſtice, as in his mercy; and, as he hath allotted a time for mercy, ſo he will for juſtice. O ſinners, think of theſe great truths, and conſider the things that belong to your everlaſting peace, before it is too late. Remember, O ſinners, that you were born into this world under the wrath of God, by reaſon of the original tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion committed by your forefather Adam, and ſee that every ſin which thou committeſt, deſerves nothing but God's wrath and everlaſting damnation. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſome think that they are already Chriſtians, and converted to God, becauſe they have been baptized in their infancy, and brought up in ſuch a church: But, my friend, whoever thou art, that harbours this opinion, without being born anew of the Spirit of God, you are as yet miſtaken; for that was the very thought that I built my profeſſion upon for many years, to my grief, and if I had departed this life in that ſtate, I ſhould have been infallibly loſt: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as I am a dying man, I tell you with love to your ſouls, as Jeſus Chriſt himſelf ſaid and confirmed it with an oath, ſaying, <q>Verily, verily, Except a
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012936_0015_0F903F508D58A810"/>
man be burn again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</q> Thou drunkard, thou bold blaſphemer, thou thief, thou whoremaſter, thou Sabbath breaker, thou adulterer, thou fornicator, thou extortioner, thou unjuſt dealer, thou liar, and thou daughters of hell, that are bond ſlaves, both you and your gueſts, to the Devil; you, I ſay, that take delight in proſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your bodies as common whores, rather than work for an honeſt living; do any, or either of you, here mentioned, think that you are Chriſtians, or that if death was to cut you off this day, that you would be received into the heavenly Jeruſalem, where no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing can enter. O! ſays the fooliſh ſinner, death is not ſo near me, I am yet young and hearty, but when I arrive at ſuch an age, then will I repent: If I were to become ſerious in my young days, I ſhould loſe all the pleaſures of this life. O! be it known to you, that if this is the language of your heart, you are deluded by your maſter, the Devil, whoſe you are, and whom you ſerve, whilſt carnally minded. Long was I deluded by him in the ſame manner, until he made me commit the crime for which I juſtly die; and, if the Lord was not pleaſed to make me a monument of his mercy and free grace, I ſhould ſuffer in hell to all eternity. O ſinners! con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how my ſins brought be to this end; and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my words, your ſins, if not repented of, will bring you to eternal torments. Conſider, you are ever dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing while in the body, ſtill drawing nigher the grave; therefore, you ſhould be always ready. O young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! do ye ſeek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near, for the Lord has made a gracious promiſe unto you; he has ſaid in his word, that they that ſeek him early, ſhall find him let old hardened ſinners go on to ſerve the Devil, if they are ſo minded; but, you young ſinners, ſeek ye the Lord in your youthful days, and you ſhall find thim, and you old hardened ſinners, whoſe heads are gray, whoſe looks of hair may be called the bloſſoms of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012936_0016_0F903F51587F5108"/>
the grave; methinks you have been ſlaves to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil long enough, if you could but know it; beg of the Lord, therefore, to ſhew you what you are by nature and by practice. Here is encouragement for all ſinners, old and young, be their ſins ever ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, ever ſo heinous, or of ever ſo deep a dye, yet the blood of Chriſt Jeſus is able and all-ſufficient to cleanſe from all ſin and iniquity; and ſeeing that the Lord is gracious unto me at the eleventh hour, in a priſon room, to me that has been in vileſt of wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; methinks, every ſinner ought to come and try the Lord, Oh! the goodneſs of God, the riches of free grace in and through Jeſus Chriſt. Now, if you ſeek the Lord, you'll certainly find him; his promiſes are ſuch, that the heavens and the earth ſhall paſs away, but one jot or title of his word ſhall not fail. If you neglect it, and obey not the ſound of the Goſpel, now in your day, be it known unto you, that you muſt obey the ſound of the trump of God at the laſt day, when the angel of the Lord ſhall ſound it, and cry aloud, Ariſe ye dead and come to judgment; then, O ſinners, ye muſt come whether you will or no: as you die judgment will find you; as the tree fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſo it doth lie: If death ſweep you off this day, in your ſins, where do you think you will find your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; certainly in torments, never to ceaſe. O then flee from the wrath to come unto the city of refuge, unto a crucified Jeſus, unto the Lamb of God, who takes away the ſins of the world of believers; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs your ſins unto him, for he alone is able to cleanſe you from them by his atoning blood, and is ever rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lly and willing to do it, if you ſhould think yourſelves unworthy by reaſon of your many offences; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me, the chief of ſinners, that as the Lord was gracious to me, ſo will he be to you, if you diligently ſeek him. Is not the blood of Chriſt ſufficient to cleanſe from all ſins? and, is not God able and willing to ſave all that come unto him in and through Jeſus Chriſt? But, if you that are filthy remain filthy ſtill,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012936_0017_0F903F5213F74848"/>
till death comes unawares, and cuts you off. Alas! for your poor ſouls, it were better for you never to have been born. The day of judgment will be an awful, ſhocking, dreadful day to you; when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will come in the clouds of heaven, in power and great glory, with his holy angels, in flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire, to take vengeance on them who know not God, and have not obeyed the Goſpel. Who will be able to bear everlaſting burnings? How will it grieve you, when you ſee them that were greater ſinners than you, placed at the right hand of the Judge, waiting for a crown of immortal glory, and you yourſelves at the left hand, waiting for the word, Depart! ye curſed! into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his angels! O terrible ſentence! depart! alas dread Sovereign, whereto? Into hell! into everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing torments! where the God of heaven will pour forth his wrath on the damned ſouls to all eternity! Oh ſinners! of all ranks and conditions tremble! And ye harlots of the city of New-York, and you inn-keepers, that entertain ſuch in your houſes; and you married or young men that are ſo led by the Devil, tremble, for you are all in danger of dropping into hell every moment, and certainly will if death overtakes you before you have got an intereſt in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, then if you intend to eſcape the wrath to come; if you ſeek or deſire the ſalvation of your own ſouls, fly from ſin, ſhun every appearance of evil; ſhun gaming, drinking, lying; ſhun bad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of all ſorts; keep holy the Sabbath of the Lord, attend to hear the word of God preached with an earneſt deſire to benefit thereby, forſaking all your former ſins and iniquities, and praying to the Lord conſtantly, and then no doubt the Lord will bleſs a word from one or another of his miniſtering ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to your hard hearts, to the breaking of them in pieces. The word of God is like unto a hammer, ſharper, then a two-edged ſword when it comes with power, and if the Lord is pleaſed to bleſs a word
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012936_0018_0F903F52C525EAB8"/>
unto you, then will you ſee the danger you are in; and if God ſo begins that work, the Lord Jeſus will certainiy give you repentance, and will take away the heart of ſtone, and give you a heart of fleſh. Then thus much being done by the grace of God, your mind, your will, and the powers of your ſoul will be changed by the Spirit of God from darkneſs unto light, and from the power of Satan unto the everliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and true God; your feet, formerly ſo nimble to run into deſtruction, will now be employed in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the houſe of God, and attending on his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; your eyes that luſted after all manner of vanities, will be now fixed on the words of ſalvation, the teſtimony of his will, the ſacred Scriptures. Chriſt Jeſus whom you ſo long rebelled againſt, will be now more precious to you then ten thouſand worlds. This is ſomething of regeneration or of the new birth, which Chriſt ſpake of, and is what I wiſh you may attain to for Chriſt's ſake, that your precious, everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and never dying ſouls may be found worthy of the promiſes of Chriſt, and of the glory, and thoſe joys which no tongue can expreſs, and which are laid up for all who truely love and ſerve the Lord; and the glory thereof ſhall be to God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt, for ever and ever.

               <head>OF MY EXPERIENCE.</head>
               <p>WHEN I was condemned, I ſaw myſelf out of Chriſt. I ſaw that I was under the curſe of a broken law, that I was a child of hell, a bond ſlave to the Devil for many years, which threw me almoſt into deſpair. Knowing that God was juſt, and that my ſins had overtaken me. My neglecting the calls of mercy ſo often in my paſt life, made me think that the Lord would not hear me now. The day after I was condemned, I had but little hopes; my paſt life being in my view, was a great ſhock to me. The 2d day of Auguſt, my burden was great, and my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled conſcience was a hell to me. But, happily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a week was expired, the fear of hell was taken away from me, and my troubled conſcience was at reſt. I ſaw that the blood of Chriſt was fully ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to cleanſe from all ſin and iniquity. When the Miniſters of Chriſt came to ſee me, I did not let them know that I enjoyed this peace, for, I was in dread leaſt I ſhould be deceived. After I enjoyed this peace two or three days, then I made it known, and was ſo lifted up with inward frames and feelings, that I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt forgot what God had done for me, in plucking me like unto a brand out of the burning: Then I thought that I was paſt all danger; but God was pleaſed to let me ſee that I was nothing of myſelf, in the following manner: Satan tempted me to ſin, and I not being on my guard, was overcome: Satan re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained near me a long while, and overcame me a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, then he wanted to make me deſpair: He conquered me ſo far, that he made me believe, all my former peace was a deluſion; then I was in dread to go to prayer, leſt it ſhould be an abomination to the Lord. I was in great diſtreſs for ſome time, until I was told of the goodneſs of God in different manners, which, when I had heard, I burſt into tears; then was I ſlain. After that, I could draw nigh to God in

Prayer, in an humble manner, but had many wreſtlings with Satan, yet the Lord helped me to reſiſt. I then <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> that I could not be ſaved without a Saviour. I knew and believed, that Chriſt Jeſus was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Meſſiah, the Anointed of God, and I truſted on him, his blood and righteouſneſs, and on none elſe. The Lord ſhewed me, that I had nothing in me that could commend me to God, therefore I continually pleaded the promiſes of Chriſt, until he was pleaſed to give me faith, that I could ſay he ſuffered for me. I always gained ground by the inſtructions of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; yet was tempted by Satan, after all this, to unbelief; but the Lord gave me to know it was a temptation, and helped me to overcome. I ſaw that I was given much to ſpiritual pride at times, which made me pray God to humble me. The week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my death, I was ſo lifted up at times, and to that degree, that the approaching death ſeemed a comfort to me; yet, at one time I could find my faith ſtronger than at another. I could ſay, that Chriſt Jeſus raiſed me from death to life. Nay, I was twice dead; dead in ſin, and dead by the laws of man, agreeable to the juſtice of God. Before I was brought to life ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by God, in and through Jeſus Chriſt; and as I am ſhortly to die a ſhameful death, which I brought upon myſelf, by reaſon of living ſo long without God in the world; yet I would die this death, in the confuſion I am now in, rather than live in this world, to be carnally minded, as uſual. I die now to live eternally. Glory be to God for his free gift, beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on me a vile ſinner. I die, though moſt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the title, one of the Iſrael of God, and an heir of glory.</p>
