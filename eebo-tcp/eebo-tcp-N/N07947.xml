            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AMONG the various Treatiſes that have been publiſhed for the Improvement and Aſſiſtance of Chriſtians of different Claſſes, I have often lamented the want of ſome truly evangelical Manuel to put into the Hands of the Lambs of the Flock; who, as they are the Purchaſe of EMANUEL's Blood, and as their tender Minds ſtand in the greateſt need of Cultivation, are certainly entituled to all the Helps we can furniſh them with — As one (and I eſteem it an eſſential) Part of my Duty, requires me to ſpend ſome Time, every Week, with Children of different Ages and Capacities; I have had great Opportunities of obſerving in what Manner, and by what Methods, divine Truths may be conveyed to their Minds ſo as to give them ſome Concern about their eternal State: The Reader will pleaſe to obſerve that I ſpeak here of human Methods only, which it is our Duty to uſe looking to the Fountain of Life for a Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>I am convinced from my own Obſervation, that thoſe Methods under GOD, are the moſt likely to anſwer the ſalutary Purpoſes above mentioned, which aim not only at informing and ſettling the Judgment of young Perſons, but alſo at affecting their Hearts, and infuſing into them a Deſire of experiencing thoſe Comforts, their Judgment is informed true Religion will produce. In this main Point, viz. The affecting the Hearts of Children, all the Pieces calculated for their Inſtruction, I have hitherto met with, are very defective. The many Catechitical Tracts

publiſhed by Divines of our own Church, however uſeful to thoſe of riper Years, and maturer Judgments, are but very few of them ſuited to the Capacities of Children; which all who have the Care of Youth muſt obſerve, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwiſe inſtructed than by <hi>Precept upon Precept, and Line upon Line, here a little and there a little.</hi> The few that are profeſſedly wrote for the Edification of Young Ones, if they ſucceed in the firſt Part, viz. in ſtoring the Mind with a Set of Principles, are very deficient in the latter, viz. in affecting their Hearts. For, however <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He ſeems to find his Way to their tender Paſſions in the moſt pathetic Manner, and plays round their Hearts, as though deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to leave the Purſuit till they are united to the Redeemer, of whom he ſpeaks. He writes not for Criticks, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>You are told how Jeſus Chriſt loved the Children of Men, and pitied poor Sinners, and became their Saviour; and what Pains and Sorrows our dear Saviour went through, to ſave his dear Children from Hell, and to bring them to Heaven.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>O Methinks, you long to know. You are eager to hear what Jeſus Chriſt did, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010142_0008_0F7D1C4C65F02C68"/>
what Way he takes to ſave and make happy his dear Children.</p>
               <p>You know I told you before, that we are all, of us become ſo unlike God, by Reaſon of Sin, that we are unfit to go to God and Heaven. Well then, Jeſus Chriſt came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Earth, to fetch us from the Earth to Heaven.</p>
               <p>O, what Love is this! as we read in God's Book, 2 Epiſt. Cor. chap. 8. ver. 9. of <hi>the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who, tho' he was rich, yet for your Sake became poor, that ye through his Poverty might be made rich.</hi> How poor did Jeſus become? Why he that was Lord of all became a poor deſpiſed out-caſt Babe. He took our Nature upon him, and was born into this World.</p>
               <p>O he looked down from the Heaven of his Glory; he ſaw how Sin and Wickedneſs had ruined the dear Children of Men, and his loving Heart was ſet upon them, and he would come to ſave them; therefore he was born into this World, under all the Meanneſs, Poverty &amp; Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace which our Sins had deſerved. His Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were poor and mean: His Birth, inſtead of a Palace was a Stable: For a Cradle, a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, where Oxen fed, was the Place where the Lord of Life and Glory was firſt laid. O what Love, what Humility is this!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:010142_0008_0F7D1C4C65F02C68"/>Now all this is to ſhew us what ſhame is due to Sin. Think of this dear little Children. See the Shame of Sin. See how low our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſtoop'd, how poor he became. Have you any Reaſon to be proud, and to love, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the great and grand Things of this World? O learn of your Saviour to deſpiſe them.</p>
               <p>Well, thus our dear Lord appeared in the Fleſh, in our Nature, in our Stead. Thus he became a Child for the Sake of dear little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that he might be their dear Brother and loving Saviour.</p>
               <p>For your Sakes your Saviour begins his Life with Poverty and Diſgrace; and as he grows up, his Sorrows and Sufferings increaſe with his Years. He had very few Friends that loved him. A great many Enemies that hated him. Few, very few, believed on him: He always went about doing Good: And yet he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuffering Evil from the Children of Men.</p>
               <p>He indeed was a Man of Sorrows, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Griefs, all his Life for your Sakes: All that he bore, all that he ſuffered, was in Love to his dear Children. His Life was a Life of Holineſs and Love; and yet wicked Men agreed to take away his dear Life, to ſpill his precious Blood, and to murder this dear Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of ours.</p>
               <p>O you may read how he is preparing for the Hour, the diſmal Hour of his Death and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010142_0009_0F7D1C4D8DB64100"/>
in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> chap. 22. ver. 44. ſee him in the Garden of <hi>Gethſemane,</hi> there in great Pain and Sorrow, he prayed to his Father; and what think you, my dear Children, was the Cauſe of all his Diſtreſs? O he feels the Load, he bears the Weight of all his dear Children's Sins upon him. He had no Sin of his own; but he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook our Cauſe, and all our Sins were laid upon his dear and innocent Head.</p>
               <p>O this makes him groan, this makes him pray in the greateſt Agony; they cauſed him to ſweat and groan, and bleed; yea to ſweat Drops, great Drops of precious Blood out of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Veins.</p>
               <p>O dear little Children, think of this; conſider what your loving Saviour once ſuffered for your Sins, for your Sakes, for your Souls; and this was on a dark Winter's Night, when the Air was ſharp, froſty and cold.</p>
               <p>O what great pains muſt your Sins put your dear Saviour to, to make him thus ſweat, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> a grievous Agony of Sorrow and Grief doth he feel! O how well did our Saviour love little Children.</p>
               <p>But this is not all; no ſooner were his Pray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers ended, but greater Sorrows, and more grie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vous Pains are coming upon him; tho' he had gone up and down for near thirty Years, doin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Good, and was always loving &amp; tender-hearted to all that came unto him: Yet O how barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly is he uſed? for a great Multitude of rude, wicked Men come with Lanthorns and Staves, to take him.</p>
               <p>O the dear, innocent Lamb! How is he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up to the Anger and Fury of Men, who like Lions and Bears, drag him away to the Governor of the City, and they tied thoſe dear Hands behind him, which had been ſo often put forth to give Sight to the Blind, to cure the Sick, to give Life to the Dead, and had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced little Children, when he bleſſed them, and alſo been very often lifted up in Prayer to his Father, for his Enemies.</p>
               <p>Thus bound he ſtood before his Judge ſilent, tho' they laid many Things to his Charge, of which he was innocent, he ſaid nothing; O, no: He knew he appeared in our Stead; we were guilty, and for our Sins he ſuffered.</p>
               <p>But his Sufferings are not at an End yet; O no: Our Sins were laid upon him; for them he muſt bleed; for them he is willing to ſhed every Drop of his precious Blood. We were ſold, all of us, my dear little Children, as Slaves to Sin and Satan; and nothing but Blood, the Blood of Jeſus, the Blood of God, could buy our Liberty.</p>
               <p>Chriſt freely gave himſelf for us: he hath bought us with his own Blood, and redeemed
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010142_0010_0F7D1C4DEC189AD0"/>
us from being Enemies to God, and Slaves to Wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>O then ſee, mark the Account, which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of our dear Saviour after he was condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to die.</p>
               <p>His cruel Enemies led him away, and they ſcourged him with Cords, till they cut deep Gaſhes on his naked Body.</p>
               <p>Then they made a Crown of Thorns, which were ſharp pointed like a Sword. This they put on his dear ſacred Head, and ſmote upon it, till they forced the Points into the Temples of his Head; and the Blood trickled down his innocent Face.</p>
               <p>Thus he was wounded from Head to Foot. And why was this done? but on Account of our ſad State and miſerable Condition, as God's Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſets it forth, chap. 1. ver. 6. our whole Head is ſick, our whole Heart is faint; from the Sole of the Foot, even unto the Head, there is no ſound Part in us; but we are all fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l of Wounds and Bruiſes &amp; putrifying Sores.</p>
               <p>So our dear Jeſus was wounded from Head to Foot; that by his S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ripes and Blood, we might be healed of all the Sickneſſes of our Souls.</p>
               <p>Thus the Blood trickled down from every Part of his innocent Body; and yet this doth not ſatisfy the cruel Rage of his Enemies; for they ſpit upon him, they mocked him, and made Game of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:010142_0010_0F7D1C4DEC189AD0"/>O how eaſy could our dear Saviour have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them dead, and frowned them into Hell in a Moment; but no, we ſee he is patient &amp; meek; he opens not his Mouth, neither doth he cry nor complain.</p>
               <p>O what Love, what Patience is this! never was the like ſeen before! But yet more &amp; more of his Love for Sinners is to be ſeen, and more of his Sufferings is ſtill to come.</p>
               <p>Die he muſt. He is condemned: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they drag him away. They lay his heavy Croſs upon his naked, wounded Body, which he carries till he is faint and tired. All about him were his Enemies laughing, and mocking him, until he comes in Sight of mount Calvary. Thither he goes up, and his Croſs being laid on the Ground, they ſtretch out his dear Arms wide. Thro' the Palms of his holy, tender Hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thro' his ſacred Feet, they drive large Nails, and ſo faſten him to the Croſs; and then lifted it up from the Ground. Thus the dear Lord Jeſus hangs on the accurſed Tree.</p>
               <p>Is not this enough to make your dear little Hearts ake, and cauſe you to weep and cry, to think of his Pains and Agonies? And yet, O how cruel and hard hearted are Men! They ſee him and they wag their Heads. They look on him thus, in the greateſt Pain; and they had no Pity, no Mercy on him; but they ſtill mocked, ſtill laughed at him. O the Racks

               <p>O how glad was he when the Lord's Day came that ſhe might go and pray with God's People, and hear God's Miniſters preach about Jeſus Chriſt, and his Love to poor Sinners!
