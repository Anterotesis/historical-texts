            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN times of public calamity, it is the duty of a good citizen <hi>to consider.</hi> If his opportunities or advantages, for knowledge and reflection, are greater than those of mankind in general, his whole duty will remain undischarged, while he confines his thoughts to the compass of his own mind. But if <hi>danger</hi> is added to the <hi>calamity</hi> of the times, he who shall communicate his sentiments on public affairs with decency and <hi>frankness,</hi> merits attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and indulgence, if he may not aspire to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and praise.</p>
            <p>Whoever attends to the tenor and design of the late act of the British Parliament for the BLOCKADE OF this HARBOUR, and duly considers the extensive confusion and distress this measure must inevitably produce; whoever shall reflect upon the justice; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and humanity of legislators, who could delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately give their sanction to such a proceedure—must be satisfied, that the man, who shall OPENLY <hi>dare to expose their conduct,</hi> hazards fatal consequences.—Legislators, who could condemn a whole town un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, nay uncited to answer; who could involve thousands in ruin and misery, without suggestion of any crime <hi>by them</hi> committed; and who could so construct their law, as that enormous pains and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013561_0005_0F90FEFA1FA0C570"/>
would <hi>inevitably</hi> ensue, NOTWITHSTAND<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING THE MOST PERFECT OBEDIENCE TO IT'S IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JUNCTIONS; I say, that legislators, thus <hi>formed as</hi> MEN, thus principled as STATESMEN, would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly imagine the attainder and death of a private individual, for his public animadversions, a less extraordinary act of power. <note n="*" place="bottom">Since this treatise was advertised in the public papers, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the press, the author hath received, from the British Coffee-House, an anonymous Let<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:013561_0006_0F90FEFAE42B4318"/>He who shall go about to treat of important and <hi>perilous</hi> concerns, and conceals himself behind the curtain of a feigned signature, gives an advantage to his adversaries; who will not fail to stigmatize his thoughts, as the notions of an unknown writer, afraid or ashamed to avow his sentiments; and hence they are deemed unworthy of notice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation. Therefore I give to the world both my sentiments and name upon the present occasion, and shall hear with patience him, who will decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refute what is advanced, and shall submit with temper to that correction and chastisement which my errors deserve.</p>
            <p>The act now under consideration opens with a recital, that <q>dangerous <hi>commotions and insurrections</hi> have been fomented and raised in Boston—by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ill-affected persons, to the subversion of his Majesty's Government, and to the utter destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the public peace, and good order of the said town; in which commotions and insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections certain valuable cargoes of Teas, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the property of the East-India Company,</hi> and on board certain vessels lying within the bay or harbour of Boston, were seized and destroyed: and in the present condition of said town and harbour, the commerce of his Majesty's subjects cannot be safely carried on there, nor the customs payable to his Majesty be duly collected.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Two questions naturally arise out of this pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: The first, whether <hi>the facts</hi> set forth are <hi>true;</hi> and Secondly, whether <hi>upon a supposition of their truth,</hi> they are a sufficient foundation for the subsequent parts of the statute, or will warrant the disabilities, forfeitures, pains and penalties, enacted and inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the subject?—Both inquiries seem intimately to concern the honour and justice of the British le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislature.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013561_0007_0F90FEFBCD75C918"/>
And however unimportant the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Americans may now appear to that august body—yet surely the judgment of Europe and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ages is not unworthy their high consideration. Removed from the eye of royalty, the piety of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign may cease to pity miseries it doth not behold; remote from the cries of public justice and the efforts of popular despair, Lords and Commons may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unaffected, for a season, with American con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions; yet justice and humanity must soon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite those operations in America and Europe, which hereafter will move even the senate of Britain. True knowledge and real virtue perhaps was never more diffused than on this northern continent; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined humanity ('tis boasted) was never more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant than in Europe at this day:—Can it be supposed, that this virtue will be discordant and inactive; that this knowledge will omit to unfold public wrongs, or that such humanity will cease to interpose?</p>
            <p>That commotions were in Boston; that East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>India tea was destroyed, are facts not controverted. But that such commotions were natural to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; that they were such as <hi>statesmen</hi> must have <hi>foreseen</hi> and A FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY, who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw, would prevent, rather than punish, is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true. The sentiments of all Americans relative to the Tea act are no secret, their fervor in the COMMON CAUSE equally known; and their probable intemperance in consequence of the arrival of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia teas, it required no profound skill in men and politics to predict. Nay the British papers were full, and the senate echoed, with the predictions similar to those which are now fulfilled. It was not difficult for <hi>Englishmen in Britain</hi> to tell how
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013561_0008_0F90FEFD0BD1E100"/>
               <hi>Englishmen in America</hi> would conduct on such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. What shall we then say? Shall we impute to those, who are dignified as "the wisest and most august" the barbarous projection—deliberately to ensnare, that they might superlatively punish? The calm deliberation of premeditated malice seems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more characteristick of a <hi>private</hi> bosom, than a <hi>public body.</hi> But Governor Hutchinson (the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative of his Majesty in this Province) when treating upon an act of <hi>the Massachusetts Government imposing</hi> a tax or <hi>duty</hi> upon goods of the inhabitants of <hi>other colonies,</hi> hath assured us, that <q>in all ages and countries, by <hi>bodies</hi> and <hi>communities of men</hi> such deeds have been done as most of the individuals of which such communities consisted, acting se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately, would have been <hi>ashamed of.</hi>

            <p>But to return. Are popular commotions pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Boston? Hath not every maritime town in England been repeatedly affected by them? Are they not incident to every commercial and popular city?—whence, then, is it, that BOSTON is devoted to such unexampled treatment? But it may be said, Boston, <hi>as a town,</hi> hath aided, abeted, and participated in these tumults. Where is the evidence of it? I presume the King, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Great-Britain had none; for they do not <hi>suggest it:</hi> I presume they did not believe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have not <hi>intimated it.</hi> And had they
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013561_0010_0F90FF0108D565F8"/>
been furnished with such evidence, had they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the fact, surely it is an imputation unworthy of their dignity, to say, that they would not have given <hi>that matter</hi> in <hi>the preamble</hi> of the statute, as the ground of their extraordinary proceedure. <hi>But the records of Boston, and known facts prove that the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants discountenanced</hi> and <hi>disavowed all riot</hi> and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I am thus warranted in saying, that the <hi>mere occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences</hi> expressed in the act, is that matter which the British legislature have judged worthy the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallelled penal severities. Whether <hi>this judgment</hi> be <hi>right,</hi> is a subject interesting to a citizen of the town to enquire; it is a subject on which <hi>a man</hi> will speak feelingly; on which AN ENGLISHMAN <hi>will</hi> speak <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>openly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Previous to further observations, it may be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to say, that the town of Boston had as <hi>a town cautiously</hi> and <hi>wisely</hi> conducted, not only without tumult, but with studied regard to established law. This the rolls of the town verify, and a hundred witnesses can confirm.</p>
            <p>At the last town-meeting relative to the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>India tea and it's consignees, it was largely debated, whether it should be an instruction to the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, who were appointed to wait on those Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>to insist</hi> on their <hi>preremptory</hi> answer;—Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>they would send back the Tea:</hi> and after long debate on the question, it passed by a very large majority in the <hi>negative.</hi> And the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est enemy of the country cannot point out any one step of <hi>the Town of Boston,</hi> in the progress of this matter, that was tumultuous, disorderly and against law. This also is an additional reason, why we must conclude that the <hi>mere temporary events which
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013561_0011_0F90FF0287178188"/>
took place in Boston,</hi> without any <hi>illegal</hi> proceedure of the town, in the matter of the tea, is in the judgment of the British senate an adequate foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the last act received from that powerful body.</p>
            <p>The first enacting clause of the statute now in view, annihilates all commercial transactions within two certain points of the harbour of Boston, upon pain of the FORFEITURE of <q>goods, wares and merchandize, and of boat, lighter, ship, vessel, or other bottom;—and of the guns, ammunition, tackle, furniture and stores, in or belonging to the same:</q> 
               <q>and of any barge, hoy, lighter, wherry, or boat into which any goods &amp;c. are laden,</q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The next paragraph, <q>in case any wharfinger, &amp;c. or any of their servants shall take up or land, or knowingly <hi>suffer</hi> to be taken up or landed, or shall ship off, or <hi>suffer</hi> to be water-born, at or from any of their said wharves, &amp;c. goods &amp;c.</q> enacts a FORFEITURE and LOSS of such <q>
                  <hi>goods</hi> &amp;c. and TREBLE the value thereof, to be computed, at the <hi>highest</hi> price of such sort of goods, &amp;c. toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the vessels and boats, and all the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, cattle, and carriages, whatsoever made use of in the shipping, unshipping, landing, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, carriage, or conveyance of any of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said goods.</q> &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next clause provides, <q>that if any ship &amp;<hi>c.</hi> shall be moored or lie at anchor, or be seen hover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within said bay, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> or within one league from the said bay, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> it shall and may be lawful for any Admiral, or <hi>commissioned</hi> officer of his Majesty's fleet or ships of war, or for ANY OFFI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CER

            </p>
            <p>Let us here pause for a moment;—let us give time for one single reflection; let us give space for one pulse of the veins—one emotion of the heart. And who can think, but those exalted characters and that generous prince, stiled THE FATHER OF all HIS PEOPLE—who united to this terrible act had many reflections, many feelings of humanity, while they were solemnly consigning thousands—if not millions—to ruin, misery and desperation?</p>
            <p>The persons in whom this authority is vested, are not confined to the ports or harbours <hi>on this continent:</hi> the vessel and cargo may be ordered to what harbour, port or station of the whole world, <hi>the officer</hi> pleases—if he appoint a <hi>continental</hi> station, 'tis grace and favour;—and what may be the price of that purchase, who can tell! what scope for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and ill-will; for pride and haughtiness; for avarice and power to wanton and insult, till the one is satiated and the other wearied!</p>
            <p>Who are the persons to whom such unbounded, such enormous power is entrusted? Power is
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013561_0013_0F90FF03EDC39768"/>
known to be intoxicating in it's nature, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to it's extent, is ever prone to wantoness: power and authority, says Plutarch, awaken every passion, and discover every <hi>latent</hi> vice:—what a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent temptation is here placed to insnare the most virtuous? But if there be one depraved passion in the bosom, as power gives scope and opportunity, how soon will it be called forth into licentious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise? Shall I be thought going too far; shall I trespass upon the bounds of truth and decency, if I say, that SOME of his Majesty's <hi>commissioned</hi> officers, in his fleet, or ships of war; SOME officers of his <hi>cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms</hi> are <hi>not altogether</hi> worthy of such high confidence and trust? Are there not <hi>inferior commissioned officers</hi> in the King's ships; are there not <hi>many</hi> of the LOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER officers of the customs, who have neither strength of understanding or integrity of heart to weild such a mighty power? Nay, may not I add, that SOME FEW (into whose hands peradventure the estate of <hi>a good</hi> subject and <hi>opulent</hi> merchant may chance to fall) are destitute of all sense, <hi>mental</hi> and <hi>humane?</hi> While contemplating this subject,—while the mind is active, and heart warm—how apt are we to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, that the illustrious Houses, who gave their sanction to this astonishing law, are dignified as learned and venerable;—and the Prince that gave his <hi>fiat,</hi> denominated—"THE WISEST AND BEST OF KINGS"?</p>
            <p>Deelining an entrance upon matters heretofore discussed by abler heads, I have omitted all obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation on the <hi>right</hi> and <hi>policy</hi> of the claims and laws of Great-Britain over the colonies; upon the same principle, I waive entering that copious field which is presented, by that part of the present act, which provides for the recovery of all forfeitures and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013561_0014_0F90FF04A2677EC0"/>
jurisdiction hath been matter of very great grievance, heart-burnings and complaint; whose judges hold their commissions <hi>by the tenure of will and pleasure;</hi> and whose large salaries are a most powerful incentive to the desire of—<hi>well-pleasing</hi> ALL <hi>on whom they depend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another passage in this statute makes <hi>utterly void</hi> ALL CONTRACTS, <q>for consigning, shipping, or carrying any goods, &amp;c. <hi>to</hi> or <hi>from</hi> the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Boston, <hi>which</hi> HAVE BEEN <hi>made</hi> or entered into, or which shall be made or entered into, so long as the act continues in force, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to any ship which shall arrive at said town or harbour after the first day of June.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Jurisprudents and the sages of the law for cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies have taught, that <hi>retrospective</hi> or <hi>post facto</hi> sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, were not only militant with the principles of found morals, but those also of political wisdom. But the Parliament, who by the bold figure of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lawers, are stiled <hi>omnipotent,</hi> here <hi>enforces</hi> a different doctrine. The english colonist, replete with loyalty to his sovereign; the descendant from Britain, animated by love for a mother-country, represses the excursions of his understanding and passions: but the subject or native of another state will feel no such restraint. <hi>He</hi> has <hi>contracted</hi> to send his merchandize to this port, expects his returns in the commodities of the country—in compliance with his obligations, his treasures are moving with hazard upon the ocean, with hopes warm for gain. The ship (in which peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he hath risqued his life as well as fortune) after many a toil and jeopardy, reaches the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> port. But how are his hopes baffled—how will be
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013561_0015_0F90FF0665EC2CF8"/>
rage and exclaim? vast hath been his expences to prepare for his adventure, and equally great his expectations from the Boston merchant. What guilt hath he contracted, what crime hath <hi>he</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that <hi>he also</hi> should be involved in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous consequences of this unexampled statute? Bouyed up for a moment, perhaps, with a vain expectation, that he may have a remedy on his <hi>contract against the merchant here;</hi>—how will this supposed foreigner sink with a ten-fold despondency, how will <hi>be</hi> rise again with adequate indignation, when he discovers all remedy gone;—his contract declared <hi>by the law, "utterly void,</hi> to ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES WHATSOEVER?"—Here again, love for a <hi>parent-</hi>country, love for a <hi>parent-</hi>king checks the current of reason, and restrains the career of passion.</p>
            <p>Having taken this view, before we proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is natural once more to ask, whence arose this extraordinary stride of legislation; what is it, that <hi>the town</hi> of Boston hath done? what new and unheard of crime have the inhabitants committed to justify enacting of such disabilities, forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, pains and penalties? punishments that descend <hi>indiscriminately on all</hi> ought to have the sanction of <hi>unerring wisdom, and almighty power,</hi> or it will be questioned, if not opposed:—The present ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance falls <hi>indiscriminately</hi> on the <hi>acknowledged inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> as well as the <hi>supposed guilty.</hi> Surely the evil is of a very malignant and terrible nature that can require such an extraordinary remedy. Admit for a moment, that the inhabitants of Boston were charged as high criminals; the highest criminals are not punishable, till arraigned before disinterested
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013561_0016_0F90FF06E11A6168"/>
judges, heard in defence, and found guilty of the charge. But so far from all this, a whole people are accused, prosecuted by they know not <hi>whom;</hi> tried they know not <hi>when;</hi> proved guilty they know not <hi>how;</hi> and sentenced in a mode, which for number of calamities, extent and duration of severity, exceeds the annals of past ages, and we presume, in pity to mankind, will not mark any future AEra in the story of the world.</p>
            <p>What will be the <hi>real</hi> consequences of this asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing measure, and what those <hi>intended and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by</hi> the <hi>planners</hi> of it are very <hi>different</hi> considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. A MACHIAVEL may plan, and his schemes prove abortive; and ALVA may be sent to execute, and his army be defeated. The circle of the arts and sciences, like the ball of empire, hath held a <hi>western</hi> course. From Chaldea and Egypt to Greece and Rome, soon after in Italy, and thence to the <hi>western</hi> provinces of Europe. Chaldea and Egypt had their Magi, their law-givers and heroes, when Greece and Rome swarmed with petty feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datories and barbarians; Greece and Rome flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in literature, when Gaul, Germany, and Britain were uncivilized, rude and ignorant. Wife and sagacious politicians have not been able to stay the rotation of this revolving <hi>scientific</hi> circle, any more than mighty potentates to repel the velocity of the flying ball of empire:—<hi>superior to human pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> like blazing stars, they hold their destined course, and play their corruscations as they run their race.</p>
            <p>The expectations of those who were the fautors of the present measures, must have been to bring down superlative distress, discord, confusion, despair, and perdition upon a multitude. How then
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013561_0017_0F90FF079F7738B8"/>
will our amazement increase, when we shall hear that the hard fate of this multitude <hi>cannot be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> Let the inhabitants comply with the requisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the statute, let them be implicitly obedient to it's injunctions:—what is the evil they will escape? what is the boon they may hope to attain? hope and fear are said to be the hinges of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Legislators have therefore considered it as sound policy, never to drive the subject into acts of despair, by causing punishments to appear as <hi>inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi> on the <hi>first promulgation</hi> of a law. When a legislative body ordaineth <hi>penalties to take</hi> place in cases of performance or non-performance of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular matters, they surely will take due care, that <hi>sufficient notice</hi> is given of <hi>their public will</hi> and <hi>suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time to comply</hi> with their mandates; so that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience may not only proceed from principles of regard to the law-makers, but motives of personal safety to the subject himself. This seems not more consonant to political wisdom, than to nature and equity.—But let us now suppose, that upon the first intimations of the present law, Boston had been as prone to obey the edict of a British Court, as the Turk to comply with the mandate of the Divan; let us imagine them as servile, as fawning as a court dependant to a minister of state;—nay, if there be any thing in nature, yet more humble and more base, let Boston (in idea for a short mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) be that humble, servile base and fawning something: What doth it all avail? The first time the inhabitants of this town had any intimation, of the will of the British Parliament, was on the tenth of may, and the act is to take place on the first of June; and thence to continue in <hi>full force,</hi> until it shall sufficiently <q>
                  <hi>appear to his Majesty that
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013561_0018_0F90FF0870CEDF80"/>
full satisfaction</hi> hath been made <hi>by</hi> or on behalf of <hi>the inhabitants of the said town of Boston to the united company of merchants of England trading to the East-Indies, for the damage sustained by the said company</hi> by the destruction of their goods sent to the said town of Boston, on board certain ships or vessels as aforesaid; AND UNTIL IT SHALL BE CERTIFIED TO HIS MAJESTY <hi>in council</hi> BY THE GOVERNOR, or LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, <hi>of the said province, that reasonable satisfaction hath been made to the officers of his Majesty's revenue and</hi> OTHERS, WHO SUFFER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED BY THE RIOTS AND INSURRECTIONS ABOVE MENTIONED, in the months of November and December in the year 1773, and in the month of January in the year 1774.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Satisfaction could not be made to the East-India company, <hi>if all Boston had the</hi> WILL and POWER to do it, till the town had time and opportunity to call a meeting, assemble, consult and determine upon the measure: great bodies are not calculated for speedy decision, any more than velocity of motion. The resolution formed; time must be given for dispatches to England, application to the East-India company, an adjustment with them upon the nice point of "full satisfaction":—that accomplished; time must be given for making the matter "<hi>sufficiently</hi> appear to his Majesty."—Let any one consider but for a moment, what a length of time must inevitably elapse before all this can be accomplished: nay, may it not well be question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, considering the parties and all persons concern'd and the circumstances of this affair, whether such accomplishment be <hi>practicable?</hi> But is this all that is to be done and effected <hi>before relief can be given to

If we say that the Governor, or Lieutenant Governor, is the <hi>implied</hi> judge of this matter: How is the question to be brought before him, how tried, and how adjusted? These also are points not settled in a moment: Long indeed would be the period before the subject in Boston will be capable to ascertain and make such satisfaction, as that <hi>the person here pointed out,</hi> would make his certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that it was plenary and <hi>reasonable.</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Bernard lately filled the chair of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while Mr. Hutchinson was second in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: Governor Hutchinson now fills the chair, and the office of Lieutenant Governor is vacant. How long would it be before the inhabitants of Boston would acquiesce in the decision of either of these gentlemen? How little probability is there, considering the sentiments, the past and present conduct of these gentlemen, that they would speedily give the required certificate?—If it hath been found difficult to touch the tender feelings of the <hi>American</hi> and <hi>Native, how long</hi> would it take to excite generous sentiments in the <hi>Briton</hi> and <hi>Stranger?</hi>

The prerequisites to the restoration of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic felicity are here not only improbable, but when considered altogether and in the present crisis of public affairs are they not impracticable? But yet worse, being accomplished, it could in no way prevent the misery and calamities of this British edict. The space given for the subject to stay this torrent of evils is so <hi>short,</hi> that it is <hi>impossible</hi> for him, exerting <hi>his</hi> utmost energies, to prevent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overwhelmed.

            <p>The civilian and statesman, the moralist and sage had heretofore delivered those maxims of truth and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013561_0021_0F90FF0DF6A69DA8"/>
those rules of government, which wise legislators have ever observed, and the bulk of mankind yet honour and revere.—To know the laws of the land <hi>already in force,</hi> previous to the publication of a new code, or in the technical phraseology of a common lawyer "to know how the law stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we make a new statute", hath been considered as an indispensable accomplishment of a good le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislator. But that illustrious Parliament, whose power is distinguished, with the appellation of "om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent", seem not to have exercised this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant knowledge;—tho' we do not hence rashly infer, that they are destitute of information, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all who are vested with <hi>omnipotence of power</hi> are ever inspired with <hi>proportionate</hi> wisdom.</p>
            <p>It must again be noticed, that no relief is to be had, "untill full satisfaction hath been made BY or ON <hi>behalf</hi> of the inhabitants of said town of Boston". Now to suppose that any in England or Europe would make satisfaction "<hi>on behalf</hi>" of said Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants was unnatural, if not absurd; but what is more to the point, it was certainly <hi>unparliamentary.</hi> The remaining alternative is that satisfaction must be made <hi>by Boston.</hi>

            <p>Every person knows, that towns in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince cannot raise or appropriate any monies, but by the express provisions and direct authority of law: it is a matter of equal notoriety that all town assessments of money are expressly confined, by the 4 Wm. &amp; Mar. c 13. to the <q>maintenance and support of the ministry, schools, the poor, and defraying of other <hi>necessary</hi> TOWN CHARGES.</q> A law which received the royal approbation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a century agone.</p>

               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:013561_0022_0F90FF0E5EA60220"/>Will any now say, that the monies appointed to be paid to the East-India house come within the words of "<hi>necessary town charges"?</hi> When did the town contract the debt, or how are they subject to the payment of it? Had the Parliament seen sit to enact, that monies requisite to satisfy the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia merchants, should be so <hi>considered;</hi> two questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (not of quick decision) might then have arisen; the one touching the validity and obligatory force of the statute; the other, whether it would then come within the intent and design of the Province law. For past doubt, our Provincial legislators had no such charge (as the one here supposed) in view, when they made the law of Wm. &amp; Mary; and in this way therefore the matter could not be brought within it's provision. Parliament must then make a <hi>new</hi> act <hi>to enable and impower Boston</hi> to pay the India company, <hi>before the town can comply</hi> with the terms of relief of their trade. In the mean while, what is to be the situation of Boston and the inhabitants of the globe with whom they have such extensive connections?—But, it is very apparent, that the Parliament have not as yet enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the payment of this satisfaction as a <hi>town charge.</hi> They have only placed it in the option of the town to make that payment, or submit to the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. That payment, we affirm, <hi>they cannot pay, without breach of the law of the land.</hi>—New and unheard of therefore is the state of this people. They must sustain the severest afflictions, they must stand the issue of distracting remedies—or—violate one of the most known and practiced laws of the land!—Let us search the history of the world;—let us inspect the records of a Spanish inquisition;

            <p>To complain of the enormities of power, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulate with over-grown oppressors, hath in all ages been denominated sedition and faction; and to turn upon tyrants, treason and rebellion. But tyrants are rebels against the first laws of Heaven and Society:—to oppose their ravages is an instinct of nature—the inspiration of GOD in the heart of man. In the noble resistance which mankind make to exorbitant ambition and power, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways feel that divine <hi>afflatus,</hi> which, paramount every thing human, causes them to consider the LORD OF HOSTS as their leader, and his angels as fellow-soldiers:—trumpets are to them joyful founds, and the ensigns of war, the banners of GOD;—their wounds are bound up in the oil of a good cause, and their blood flows into the veins of a Saviour; sudden death is to them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent martyrdom, and funeral obsequies resurrections to eternal honour and glory:—their widows and babes, being received into the arms of a compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate GOD, and their names enrolled among

            <p>There are other parts of the act now before us, which merit notice: particularly that, relative to the prosecution of suits in the ordinary courts of law, "for any thing done in pursuance of the act"; by which the defendant is enable <q>to plead the general issue, and give the act, and the general matter, in evidence</q>: whereupon it follows, that "if it <hi>shall appear</hi> so to have been done, the jury SHALL find for the defendant"; who, by an after clause, is to "recover <hi>treble</hi> costs". From this passage some have been lead to conclude, that <hi>the appearance</hi> of this matter was to be <hi>to the Judge;</hi> and that if it had <hi>that appearance to him,</hi> and he should direct the jury accordingly; <hi>however it might appear to the jury,</hi> they <hi>must</hi> follow <hi>the directions of the Judge,</hi> and acquit the defendant. But this is a construction, which as the words do not <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> carry that meaning, I will not permit myself to suppose the design of the law. However the late donations of large salaries by the crown, to the justices of our superior Courts, who are nominated by the Governor, and hold their commission, <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante bene placito,</hi> have not a little contributed to the preceeding apprehension.</p>
            <p>Another passage makes provision for <q>assigning and appointing such and so many open places, quays and wharfs, within the said harbour, creeks, havens and islands, for the landing, discharging, lading and shipping of goods, as his Majesty, his heirs or successors, shall judge necessary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient</q>;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013561_0025_0F90FF10A037DD20"/>
and also for <q>appointing such and so many officers of the customs therein, as his Majesty shall think sit; after which it shall be lawful for any person or persons to lade or put off from, or to discharge and land upon, such wharfs, quays, and places, so appointed within the said harbour, AND NONE OTHER, any goods, wares and merchandize whatsoever.</q> By which the property of many <hi>private</hi> individuals is to be rendered useless, and worse than useless; as the <hi>possession</hi> of a thing, aggravates the misfortune of those who are deprived of a capacity to enjoy. But if the property of <hi>some few</hi> is to be rendered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth, so that of <hi>many others</hi> is to be openly invaded:—But why should we dwell upon <hi>private</hi> wrongs, while those of <hi>the multitude</hi> call for all our attention?</p>
            <p>If any should now say—we are a commercial people—commercial plans can <hi>only</hi> save us. If any think that the ideas of the merchant are at this day to give spring to our nerves and vigour to our actions; if any say, that <hi>empire</hi> in this age of the world, is only <hi>founded</hi> in commerce:—let him show me the people emancipated from oppression by commercial principles and measures: let him point me, that unexplored land, where <hi>trade</hi> and <hi>slavery</hi> flourish together. Till then, I must hold a different creed; and believe—that tho' commercial views may not be altogether unprofitable; that tho' commercial plans <hi>may</hi> do <hi>much, they never can do</hi> ALL.

            <p>The proper object of society and civil instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is the advancement of "<hi>the greatest happiness of the greatest number".</hi> The people (as a body, being never <hi>interested</hi> to injure themselves and uniformly desirous of the general wellfare) have ever made this <hi>collective felicity</hi> the object of their wishes and pursuit.

            <p>The policy and refinements of men cloathed with authority often deceive those who are subject to it's controul; and thus a people are often induced to waive their rights, and relinquish the barriers of their safety. The fraud, however, must at last be discovered, and the nation will resume their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent liberties, if there be no force sufficient to screen the usurper and defend his domination. <hi>The sword</hi> alone is sufficient to subdue that spirit which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells rulers to their duty, and tyrants to their senses.

            <p>A large army and revenue are not easily and at once forced upon a free people.

So great has been the credulity of the British Court, from the beginning, or such hath been the activity of false brethren, that no tale inimical to the Northern Colonies, however false or absurd, but what hath found credit with administration, and operated to the prejudice of the Country.

period to the present. The crimes of the guilty are to them the cords of association, and dread of punishment, the indissoluble bond of union.

            <p>What insidious arts, and what deteitable practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have been used to deceive, disunite and enslave the good people of this Continent? The mystical appellations of loyalty and allegiance, the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble names of government and good order, and the sacred ones of piety and public virtue have been alternately prostituted to that abominable purpose. All the windings and guises, subterfuges and doublings, of which the human soul is susceptible, have been displayed on the occasion. But secrets which were thought impenetrable are no longer hid; characters deeply disguised are openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed: the discovery of gross impostors hath gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

mint and cummin hath, often, been pretended by those who were infidels at bottom; and it is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that <hi>attachment to the dignity of Government, and the King's service,</hi> hath often flowed from the mouths of men who harboured the darkest ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations against <hi>the true end of the former,</hi> and were destitute of every right principle of loyalty <hi>to the latter.</hi> Hence then, care and circumspection are necessary branches of political duty.

               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 vol. Lords Prot. p. 141. Anno 1736.</note> so much more caution and resistance are required against the over-bearing of rulers, than the extravagance of the people.</p>
            <p>To give no more authority to any order of state and to place no greater public confidence in any man, than is necessary for the general wellfare, may be considered by the people as an important point of policy. But though craft and hypocrisy are prevalent, yet piety and virtue have a real existence: duplicity and political imposture abound, yet bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence and public spirit are not altogether banished the world. As wolves will appear in sheep's-cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so superlative knaves and parricides will assume the vesture of the man of virtue and patriotism.</p>
            <p>These things are permitted BY PROVIDENCE, no doubt, for wise and good reasons. Man was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated a rational, and was designed for an active be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. His faculties of intelligence and force were given him for use. When the wolf, therefore, is found devouring the flock, no hierarchy forbids a seisure of the victim for sacrifice; so also, when
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:013561_0082_0F90FF472635A590"/>
dignified impostors are caught destroying those, whom their arts deceived and their stations destined them to protect,—the sabre of justice flashes right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness at the stroke of execution.</p>
            <p>Yet be not amused, my Countrymen!—the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of bondage, and the reestablishment of freedom are not of easy acquisition. The worst passions of the human heart, and the most subtle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the human mind are leagued against you; and principalities and power have acceded to the combination. Trials and conflicts you must, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, endure;—hazards and jeopardies—of life and fortune—will attend the struggle.
