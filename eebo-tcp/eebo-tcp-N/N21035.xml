            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>by lingering ſickneſs, or by ſudden accident; wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at home amongſt our friends, or abroad in diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant lands, where none but ſtrangers ſhall hear our dying groans. If the LORD be with us: if "the GOD of Jacob be our help," all will be well; we may ſafely cloſe our eyes on all mortal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and leave the world in peace.</p>
            <p>We are convened this day, my brethren, on a very ſingular occaſion. Singular, at leaſt, in the preſent age of the world. The life of MAN is placed at "three ſcore years and ten." But we are met to commemorate the goodneſs of GOD to his <hi>aged ſervant,</hi> here preſent, whoſe life has been protracted to the uncommon period of a HUNDRED YEARS this day. With wonder and with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, we hail ſuch an unuſual ANNIVERSARY. "Our FATHERS, where are they?" Gone to the world of immortality. But how few of them had arrived at this advanced age, before they quitted the ſtage of mortality!</p>
            <p>It is the deſign of the preſent diſcourſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going into a particular conſideration of the connexion in which the words ſtand with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, to take them as a diſtinct ſentence, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very important truth, and to endeavour ſome improving reflections from them, ſuited to this occaſion, and to the circumſtances of the <hi>aged</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, preſent; and likewiſe to deduce ſuch remarks, as may, by the bleſſing of GOD, be of general uſe and benefit to all.</p>
            <p>There are TWO principal ideas held up to view, in the paſſage before us, to which your attention is invited.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The firſt is, the <hi>frailty</hi> and <hi>mortality</hi> of man.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:027630_0004_0FD5C58893946F98"/>II. The ſecond, that there are certain caſes and circumſtances in human life, in which it may juſtly be ſaid, "<hi>There is but a ſtep between us and death.</hi>"</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are naturally led to contemplate the <hi>frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>mortality</hi> of man. The term DEATH, in our text, is full of awful import. <hi>Here</hi> is the end, not of our exiſtence: Happy, comparatively hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for the wicked, the finally impenitent ſinner, if it were ſo! But the end of all worldly joys and woes. <hi>Here</hi> is the entrance on a new, an untried ſtate of exiſtence, which will never end. What a ſubject this for ſerious reflection and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! A ſubject equally intereſting to the parent and the child, to the aged and the youth. Why then ſhould "the living who know they muſt die, put far away that <hi>evil day?</hi>" A day, which they cannot, by all their efforts, ward off, nor by all their tears of anxiety and diſtreſs, avoid. An event, which will not be bribed, by all the riches of the world, to a moment's delay. For "who," or by what price, can a man "redeem his broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or give to GOD a ranſom," that ſhall reprieve him from death?</p>
            <p>When we take a view of the amazing havoc and deſtruction which that relentleſs enemy <hi>Death</hi> has made in our world, what a diſtreſsful reflection does it afford! It ſpares no age, ſex or character. The prince on the throne and the beggar in his cottage, are alike ſubject to his awful power. The father and the ſon, the tender mother and the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs babe, muſt each feel his fatal ſhaft, and bow to death. Nay, this king of terrors ſhews no more favour to the virtuous than to the profligate.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:027630_0005_0FD5556C20CF8D28"/>
The righteous and the wicked, the ſaint and the ſinner, muſt equally fall before him, and ſubmit to his dreadful ſceptre. For "it is appointed to all," all without diſtinction, "once to die." Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, my friends, if <hi>but once!</hi> For we are informed in the ſacred word, of a "<hi>ſecond</hi> death." A death, far more terrible than that of the body. It means the death of the ſoul; which term, in the language of ſcripture, is figuratively uſed to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy its eternal ſeparation from GOD, and from all happineſs; to a ſtate of endleſs darkneſs and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery. But bleſſed be GOD, the ſame divine word does alſo inform us, that <hi>this</hi> death may be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For it is written, "Bleſſed and holy are they that have part in the firſt reſurrection, for on ſuch the <hi>ſecond death</hi> hath no power." Who are theſe privileged ones? it will be natural to inquire. Who, theſe happy ſouls, on whom that dreadful calamity ſhall never fall? The ſacred word deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes them, as the holy "followers of the Lamb." None but the friends and followers of JESUS, who have choſen him with all their hearts, for their Saviour and their King, will be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this glorious privilege of eternal exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the <hi>ſecond</hi> death. For them, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath "aboliſhed death," and will enable them to triumph over it as a conquered enemy, in the lively hope of a bleſſed immortality. But, from the <hi>firſt</hi> death, there is no eſcape. "There is no diſcharge in that war." This is an enemy which has, ever ſince the apoſtacy of man, been going on from conquering to conquer; and will finally ſubdue the whole of our fallen race.</p>
            <p>What a melancholy picture is preſented to our
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:027630_0006_0FD5556D9C4F3140"/>
minds, if we only take a view of the awful ravage and deſolation this enemy is making at the <hi>preſent day,</hi> among the contending armies in <hi>Europe;</hi> where the horrid "noiſe of war and garments rolled in blood" are the conſtant theme; the daily objects before their eyes! Oh! how doth humanity ſhudder at the thought of whole hecatombs of human lives immolated at the ſhrine of ambition and the accurſed luſt of empire! Or ſacrificed to glut the vengeance of deſpotic tyrants, or to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the wild, the unhappy ravings of a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary enthuſiaſm! In either view it muſt be, to ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery feeling mind, a diſtreſſing reflection! Painful beyond expreſſion, that there ſhould be ſuch a thoughtleſs, ſuch an impious waſte of human blood, as if it were of no more value, than that of beaſts of ſlaughter! Oh! what a tremendous reckoning muſt the aggreſſors, the criminal authors of ſuch deſtruction and miſery, have hereafter! and what an awful account muſt they give up, in the great day of dread deciſion! in that day, when thrones and ſceptres ſhall no longer protect the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from juſtice, nor lawleſs power ſhield the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer from the vengeance of a righteous GOD!</p>
            <p>But while we contemplate with horror, theſe ſcenes of deſtruction, in fields of battle; we are ready to inquire, is it <hi>there</hi> only, that the enemy death is making deſolation? Alas! no. He comes, with reſiſtleſs force, into the peaceful hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itations of domeſtic ſecurity and friendſhip; and often ſpreads a melancholy gloom over whole families. A tender huſband, an affectionate wife, is ſnatched from the embraces of the ſorrowful partner. The hapleſs child is left a ſolitary
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027630_0007_0FD5556F56C6A0A0"/>
orphan, bereft of the guide of its youth. And how often does the tender parent mourn the untimely death of his offspring, cut down in the morning of life! But ſuch is the will of heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; who ſaith, "Be ſtill and know that I am GOD." He hath righteouſly ordained that the reign of death ſhould be univerſal, and all muſt, ſooner or later, fall before it. The time when, the place where, or the means by which this event will take place, are exceedingly various; all, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ordered by the wiſe diſpoſing providence of GOD, and as wiſely kept a ſecret from mortals, reſerved in the breaſt of infinite wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Yet it is an event to which mankind are liable, every moment. Which leads us to the SECOND thing propoſed, viz.</p>
            <p>That there are certain circumſtances in human life, and in which it may be truly ſaid, "there is but a <hi>ſtep</hi> between us death." The inquiry here, naturally is, <hi>when</hi> do theſe caſes occur and what are thoſe circumſtances, and who the perſons, of whom it can be affirmed with truth, that they are within "a ſtep" of death? In anſwer, the following things are obſerved.</p>
            <p>FIRST, The aſſertion is ſtrictly true, in a ſenſe, of ALL our dying race. They walk every day, by the brink of the grave, by the very gates of the eternal world. It is but a <hi>breath</hi> that ſeparates us from the inviſible ſtate. "For what is our life but a <hi>vapour,</hi> that appeareth for a little time and then vaniſheth away." Surely "man at his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity." "He giveth up the Ghoſt, and where is he?"</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, The truth in our text, may, with
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:027630_0008_0FD5C589F25010E0"/>
ſpecial propriety, be applied to that claſs of men, "who go down to the ſea in ſhips, who do buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in great waters." Our SEAFARING BRETH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REN are an order of citizens, important indeed to ſociety, and whoſe <hi>calling</hi> is both lawful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. But every one knows it is alſo an haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardous one. Do they wiſely reflect on the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that ſurround them? Are they ſenſible on what precarious ground they ſtand every moment while purſuing their buſineſs on the mighty billows? That "there is but a ſtep," a <hi>plank,</hi> "between them and death." How important, how ſerious is the reflection! What a ſolemn argument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of the neceſſity of religion, of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to GOD, and of actual readineſs for death; that if it ſhould be ſudden, it may not come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, nor meet them with ſurpriſe; which leads us to obſerve,</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, How many SUDDEN ACCIDENTS, in the daily courſe of life, verify the words of our text, and are an awakening proof that "there is but a <hi>ſtep</hi> between us and death." An <hi>apoplexy,</hi> a <hi>fall,</hi> a <hi>blow,</hi> a <hi>wound,</hi> and ſometimes a ſudden burſt of <hi>violent paſſion,</hi> have, in an inſtant ſnapped aſunder the brittle thread of life, and ſwiftly hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the ſoul into the eternal world. Such events are by no means uncommon. How frequently do we read and hear of them? How often too, do mankind experience narrow, even <hi>hairbreadth</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes from inſtant death? when, to appearance, a miracle alone could have preſerved them. That ſuch caſes do not more frequently prove fatal, and that our lives are not taken away by innumerable accidents, to which we are daily expoſed, is to be
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:027630_0009_0FD55572F37B4E58"/>
aſcribed to nothing but the immediate, conſtant interpoſition of GOD, whoſe powerful and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful hand upholds us, each moment of life. I doubt not, that while I am now ſpeaking, there are numbers here preſent, who can teſtify, from their own experience, to the truth of theſe obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, who, this moment, recollect the day, the place, the circumſtance, in which they narrowly eſcaped being inſtantly deprived of life, and ſent quickly into eternity. But the LORD was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, and has ſpared you yet a little longer. Let it not be, to fill up a greater meaſure of ſin; but, O! may your gratitude to GOD be as ſignal, as was your deliverance!</p>
            <p>FOURTHLY, A SICK BED has often witneſſed the truth of our text, that "there is but a ſtep between us and death." Can none of us affirm this alſo, from our own experience? Have we not been, by a violent <hi>fever,</hi> by excruciating <hi>pain,</hi> or, by more <hi>ſlow diſcaſe,</hi> reduced to the very verge of life; our friends weeping around us, hourly expecting to ſee us breathe our laſt; phyſicians are of no avail, the diſorder baffles their utmoſt ſkill, all hopes of recovery ſeemed to be gone, and in our own apprehenſion, if we had our ſenſes, all the proſpect was, vaſt, boundleſs, amazing eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! When, all on a ſudden, by an unexpected and unaccountable turn of the diſeaſe, we were, as if by the immediate voice of GOD, called back again to life, ſnatched as from the borders of the pit, ranſomed from the grave, and at a moment, when it might, with truth be ſaid, "There was but a <hi>ſtep</hi> between us and death."</p>
            <p>Once more, <hi>fifthly;</hi> with peculiar propriety,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027630_0010_0FD555746282E660"/>
may the expreſſion in the text be applied to thoſe who are far advanced in OLD AGE. We know, indeed, that no age in life is exempt from the ſtroke of death. The youth who is now ſporting in all the pleaſures and gaieties of juvenile years, may be in his grave, before the <hi>man</hi> whom we here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, bowed under the weight of years. It is not unuſual that the faireſt blooms are ſooneſt cropt, by the cold hand of relentleſs death. But when a perſon has arrived at his <hi>threeſcore and ten,</hi> there ſeems to be a moral certainty of a ſpeedy diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His hoary hairs and enfeebled limbs daily admoniſh him that it is but "a <hi>ſtep</hi>" that divides him from the congregation of the dead, from "the houſe appointed for all the living." Every hour tells him, the ſands in his glaſs are juſt run out, that his "days are numbered, and almoſt finiſhed." O how proper, how important, that thoſe who have arrived at <hi>old age,</hi> ſhould ſet looſe from this world and all the enjoyments, cares, frowns and flatteries of it, view themſelves as at the door of the grave, live in daily expectation of the ſummons that will call them into the world of ſpirits; and give all diligence that they be found in readineſs for their laſt remove.</p>
            <p>Having briefly ſuggeſted ſome obſervations from the paſſage before us, in a doctrinal way, I poceed to the</p>
            <div type="improvement">
               <head>IMPROVEMENT.</head>
               <p>A variety of uſeful remarks might be drawn from this intereſting ſubject. I ſhall confine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and aſk your attention only to a few of them, at this time.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:027630_0011_0FD55575DFE2FAA8"/>1ſt, It naturally leads us, in the firſt place, to a <hi>humbling</hi> reflection on the weak, miſerable ſtate of man, in conſequence of his guilty apoſtacy from GOD. Here is the baneful ſource of all our woe. To this fountain, we may trace all thoſe bitter ſtreams of ſorrow, pain, miſery and death, which ſpread ſuch a dark and gloomy ſhade over this fallen world. From this ſource, have proceeded thoſe rivers of blood which have deluged the earth; by wars, perſecutions, oppreſſions, tyrannies, by anarchy, fanaticiſm and ſuperſtition; which, at different periods of time, have ſo much diſgraced humanity and diſtreſſed the world. From the ſame cauſe have ariſen all thoſe bitter animoſities, feuds and diſſentions which have diſturbed the happineſs of ſocieties, diſcord and variance in families, hatred and ſtrife among individuals; in a word, all the unnumbered calamities that have befallen mankind from generation to generation, down to this day. They have all taken their riſe from man's ſinful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from his GOD. Nor do the evils terminate here. They are not confined to the preſent life. Thoſe endleſs miſeries in the future world, which await the wicked, and the finally impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, are but the juſt fruit and "wages of ſin." But while we contemplate the diſmal effects of ſin, both in this and the coming world, what cauſe have we,</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, To adore the infinite wiſdom and goodneſs of GOD, that there is a foundation laid in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel for <hi>hope</hi> even in <hi>death.</hi> That the conſideration of the <hi>certainly</hi> of death, does not, neceſſarily land the mind in the region of <hi>hopeleſs</hi> deſpondency. Bleſſed be GOD, that although we <hi>muſt</hi> die, yet
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:027630_0012_0FD5C586EA9D1E60"/>
we <hi>may</hi> live again, and live a new, a better life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the grave: a life of glorious immortality and joy; where ſorrow and death ſhall reign no more for ever. For theſe hopes and this happineſs, we are entirely and excluſively indebted to the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt. This has brought "life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to light." Here we find that "JESUS is the reſurrection and the life;" and that he that "believeth in HIM, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live."</p>
               <p>It is, indeed, a ſolemn thing to exchange worlds, to go from time into eternity. The way through death is a <hi>dark valley,</hi> but JESUS can enlighten this paſſage. He has once, himſelf, paſſed through it. For he was dead, and behold he is alive, and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forevermore, Amen; and hath the keys of hell and of death." It is through this <hi>door</hi> of death that he has appointed all his friends ſhall follow him to glory. He will not therefore, "leave or forſake them," when they ſhall come to it. He has, by travelling through the dark valley himſelf, ſweetened the paſſage for all his children, who come after him. So that many of them have cheerfully ventured into it, leaning upon the promiſe of their GOD and Saviour, and from ſweet experience, have been ready to adopt thoſe comfortable lines,
<q>
                     <l>"JESUS can make a dying bed,</l>
                     <l>Feel ſoft as downy pillows are,</l>
                     <l>While on his breaſt I lean my head,</l>
                     <l>And breathe my life out ſweetly there."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Have you never, my brethren, within your own obſervation, had occaſion to witneſs this truth; in the triumphant departure of ſome, who, in their <hi>laſt hours</hi> have enjoyed unſpeakable ſerenity of mind, if not tranſported with the lively hope of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:027630_0013_0FD5557A29ED3720"/>
glory? Although, <hi>perhaps,</hi> a little before, or during their ſickneſs, they were in great darkneſs and fear, reſpecting their ſtate. They wept, they trembled at the awful proſpect before them. Yet, through the goodneſs of a faithful GOD, before they left the world, the clouds diſperſed, the everlaſting moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains appeared; the tear of diſtreſs was wiped from their eyes, by the gentle hand of their compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Saviour, and the ſting of the dreaded mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, was rendered pointleſs and eaſy, by the balmy ſupports of the goſpel, and the ſweet "conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of CHRIST," in their expiring moments. Are theſe the bleſſed effects of a hope founded on the <hi>goſpel?</hi> O! with what ardour of gratitude ſhould we join the Apoſtle, and ſay, "Thanks be to GOD for this unſpeakable gift."</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, The ſubject teaches us that death, or mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>dying</hi> is, by no means the principal thing we have to fear in that ſolemn hour. There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing infinitely more dreadful than death, which is SIN. It is <hi>this,</hi> and this only, that clothes death with its principal horrors.</p>
               <p>There is, indeed, ſomething terrible and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to nature, in the thoughts of dying. Nature ſhrinks from the diſſolution, dreads the painful ſtroke which ſeparates the ſoul from the body, and all its tender earthly connexions. But the apoſtle tells us, "the <hi>ſting</hi> of death is SIN." It is <hi>this</hi> that arms it with terror. When <hi>this</hi> is taken away by the pardoning mercy of GOD, through the precious blood of Jeſus, death is ſtripped of its gloom, and becomes the friendly meſſenger, ſent by the bleſſed Saviour, to call his children home to thoſe "manſions in his Father's houſe, which
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027630_0014_0FD523A852121558"/>
he went, as their forerunner, to prepare for them." They meet him therefore with courage; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a tranſport of joy, ſaying, "O death where is thy ſting! Thanks be to GOD who giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me the victory, through our Lord JESUS CHRIST." Which leads me to remark,</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. The ſubject points out the <hi>only</hi> ſafe ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of <hi>hope</hi> in death, viz. JESUS CHRIST. This, this is the "chief corner ſtone," on which you and I, my hearers, muſt reſt our hope, if ever we expect to meet death with comfort and ſafety. "Other foundation can no man lay." The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict will be inexpreſſibly terrible, without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt, without the almighty ſupport of his love and power. Every other foundation will aſſuredly fail. Where elſe would you look for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port? Shall you place confidence in your having been educated in a chriſtian country, and brought up under the light of the goſpel? Or will you build your hopes on your good intentions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, on your prayers, tears and religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances? Or dare you venture your all for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, on your having made a profeſſion of relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and attended the ordinances of the goſpel? In a word, will you truſt to your works of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or your deeds of charity? Theſe props are too weak to ſupport a dying man, or give com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to a ſoul juſt launching into eternity, and about to appear before a holy God. Be aſſured, that if you have no better foundation than <hi>theſe,</hi> your "expectation will periſh;" theſe will all ſink from under you, and prove as mere "refuges of lies," which will be ſwept all away by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of death, and will leave you hopeleſs, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and undone forever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:027630_0015_0FD5557CA280EA90"/>But if on the other hand, your hope reſts on this "Rock of ages" JESUS CHRIST alone, if your confidence is built on the ground of that everlaſting righteouſneſs which he has wrought out, that complete atonement he hath made for ſin; "nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life nor <hi>death</hi> can ſeparate you from the love" and eternal enjoyment "of God;" nor can "the gates of hell prevail againſt you."</p>
               <p>THE GREAT CONCERN, therefore, the all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant inquiry, my hearers, is, have <hi>we,</hi> or have we not, built our HOPE on <hi>this</hi> foundation? The ſubject before us, as well as the occaſion, render ſuch an examination peculiarly ſuitable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, not to one more than to another; but to <hi>all,</hi> of whatever age, claſs, or condition, of life. Are we not all mortal? Do we know the day of our death, or the length of time that infinite wiſdom has allotted us for our probation here? Are we certain that the term has not nearly expired? And are we ſecure one hour, or moment, from the arreſt of death?</p>
               <p>It has been obſerved, and juſtly, that the words of our text are truly, applicable to every one; that "There is but a <hi>ſtep</hi> between us and death." That "our life is but a <hi>vapour,</hi>" and who can tell when, or how ſuddenly, that vapour ſhall be driven away? Without doubt, it will be much ſooner, with many, than they now expect.</p>
               <p>Are any of you, now in the <hi>prime</hi> of life; in the vigour of <hi>youth?</hi> Will <hi>this</hi> prove a ſecurity againſt the ſtroke of death? Look to yonder, <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotha,</hi> and ſee the graves of many a <hi>lovely youth,</hi> ſnatched from their fond parents in the morning of life; youths, who as little thought of dying as you do this day, until the fatal ſummons came.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:027630_0016_0FD5557E1EFA30E8"/>Are others of you in the <hi>meridian</hi> of life, involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the cares of a family, and buſily engaged in worldy ſchemes and purſuits? And are <hi>you</hi> ſure that your ſun will not ſet before the evening of old age, or that your preſent engagements ſhall not be interrupted by an unexpected call into the eternal world? Are you ſure that the awful words pronounced by the prophet to <hi>Hannaniah,</hi> will not be verified in you, "This year thou ſhalt die!" What frequent admonitions have we, by the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and daily calls of one and another from us by death, to "prepare to meet our GOD," "leſt coming ſuddenly, he find us ſleeping."</p>
               <p>Let the ſolemn queſtion then, be brought home to our boſoms. Am I prepared for that <hi>ſtep</hi> which will uſher my immortal ſpirit into the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate preſence of my maker, GOD? Have I, at preſent, <hi>any</hi> hope at all, on which I make depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? If ſo, is my hope any thing better than "the ſpider's web," or the "hope of the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, which will periſh when GOD takes away my ſoul." On what ground am I building for eternity? Is it on the <hi>ſandy</hi> foundation of mere <hi>morality,</hi> or my own good works? Is it on an empty <hi>profeſſion</hi> of godlineſs? Or upon ſome favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite <hi>name,</hi> party, denomination or diſtinction among men? Is it upon tranſient <hi>affections,</hi> ſudden <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes,</hi> or <hi>flaſhes of joy,</hi> like thoſe of the "ſtony ground hearers?" Are <hi>theſe</hi> the foundation on which I am building my eternal hopes? Or, is it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that firm, that immoveable ROCK, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus?</hi> Have I ever deeply felt my periſhing need of this foundation? my utter depravity, guilt and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs; the righteouſneſs of that law that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027630_0017_0FD5C58CF70A60B8"/>
the tranſgreſſor of it to eternal puniſhment, for every inſtance of violation? Gal. iii. 10. Have I been convinced of the entire inſufficiency of all "works of rigteouſneſs which I have done," or can do to make the leaſt atonement for my ſins, or procure my pardon and acceptance with a holy and juſt GOD? And being divinely enlightened, have, I "fled for refuge" to the perfect and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious atonement of CHRIST, as "the only hope ſet before me?" Have I ſeen the ſafety, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of this foundation, ſo as cordially to truſt in it for my whole ſalvation; that I can humbly ſay, in the language of the prophet, "in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength?"</p>
               <p>And is my hope of that kind, that it "<hi>purifies</hi> me, even as HE is pure?" Am I become, indeed, a "New creature?" Have "old things paſſed away?" If I have experienced a change of <hi>heart,</hi> is it manifeſted by a change of <hi>life?</hi> by a ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous care to "deny all ungodlineſs and every worldly luſt, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in the world?" THESE are the ſcriptural marks of a real chriſtian. If <hi>theſe</hi> are found in us, my brethren, WE are chriſtians: And have juſt ground of "rejoicing in the hope of the glory of GOD." And death, how ſoon or ſuddenly ſoever it may come, can do us no harm: we ſhall fall aſleep in Jeſus.</p>
               <p>But if not, in the name of GOD, it is high time to awake and look to our ſtanding. For it is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, on "ſlippery places;" and "there is but a STEP between us and death." And if "our feet ſhould ſlide," while in the preſent condition, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an inſupportable load of guilt, the weight will
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:027630_0018_0FD55582D1A793B8"/>
inevitably plunge us into a ſtate of remedileſs woe, of endleſs ruin. On the other hand, how joyful, how glorious is the proſpect which a good hope in Chriſt preſents to the dying chriſtian! Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully may he look forward to the departing hour, and with ſweet ſerenity adopt the ſacred triumph of the apoſtle, "I am more than a conqueror through him that hath loved me."</p>
               <p n="5">5thly. But I now cloſe the diſcourſe, by a more particular application of the ſubject to that aged, <hi>very aged</hi> perſon, on whoſe account we are convened this day; and at whoſe requeſt I ſtand here on this occaſion.</p>
               <p>How great, <hi>venerable Father!</hi> how diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the goodneſs of that merciful GOD, who has upheld you through all the viciſſitudes of a long life, and has lengthened out your days to this remarkable period! What millions of inhabitants have been ſwept off from the earth, ſince you came upon the ſtage of life! and how few COE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VALS have you in our world! With what wonder and gratitude have you cauſe to look back upon the varied ſcene of life you have paſſed through, and upon the revolutions and changes you have ſeen, ſince the days of youth! Changes in the <hi>nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural</hi> world; changes, ſurprizing changes in the <hi>political,</hi> and in the <hi>moral</hi> world. To us, Sir, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to our riſing youth, the race of life you have run, appears very long indeed. But not ſo to you, as you have told me, but a mere <hi>ſpan.</hi> Upon a retroſpective view of it, methinks you are ready to ſay, with the aged patriarch, when the curious queſtion was put to him by Pharaoh, "How old art thou?" In reply, "<hi>Few</hi> and evil
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:027630_0019_0FD55584F9D35C28"/>
have the days of the years of my life been." You cannot, however, add, as in the next words, that "you have not attained to the years of the life of your <hi>fathers,</hi> in the days of their pilgrimage;" for you have exceeded them <hi>all,</hi> and almoſt all upon the preſent ſtage of action.</p>
               <p>A rare ſight! my brethren, our eyes behold, this day! A fellow citizen, who has ſurvived a <hi>century!</hi> Born when <hi>New-England</hi> was in its childhood; when <hi>America</hi> was, comparatively, a wilderneſs; but about SEVENTY YEARS after the landing of our <hi>forefathers</hi> in PLYMOUTH, the place of his birth. May the unuſual ſight ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly affect our minds, and excite ſerious and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reflections on the wonderful power, goodneſs, patience and tender mercy of GOD to his creatures!</p>
               <p>And while you, AGED FATHER, with good old JACOB, acknowledge, with a grateful heart, "the GOD that hath fed you all your life long," may you not, with peculiar propriety, now, at the cloſe of a long life, adopt the words of DAVID in the text, and ſay, "There is but a <hi>ſtep</hi> between me and death!" an important ſtep indeed. You will naturally, on this occaſion (as far as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled powers of your mind, which are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily impaired by age, will permit) be led to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the great, the intereſting change that lies juſt before you; and the awful importance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found in actual readineſs for it. You have "heard and learned" from the goſpel, what that foundation is, on which alone, you, and we all, can with ſafety build our hopes, and die in peace. And that "other foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt." The all-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:027630_0020_0FD55587ACA50420"/>
atonement made, and the everlaſting righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs brought in by HIM, is that Rock, on which you may, with infinite ſecurity and ſatisfaction depend, when you ſhall be called to take that <hi>laſt ſtep</hi> which will introduce your unbodied ſpirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a world of untried and immortal exiſtence. On <hi>this</hi> ground, never did one fail, or come ſhort of heaven. On <hi>this</hi> foundation then, fix, immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fix your faith and hope. Then, may you, with patience and ſerenity of ſoul, "all the days of your appointed time wait, till your change comes," when, with a gentle ſtroke, the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger death ſhall give you a peaceful diſmiſſion from earth to "a brighter world on high." And in the mean time, may you, the few intervening days that heaven may allot you, between this and the parting hour, be enabled to adopt the words of "Paul the <hi>aged,</hi>" and ſay "I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand, henceforth is laid up for me, a crown of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which the Lord, the righteous Judge will give me in that day, and not to me only, but to all them alſo that love his appearing."</p>
               <p>FINALLY, brethren and friends, all, who have met here this day and on this occaſion, the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar event which has called us together, is adapted to excite very uſeful and improving reflections in the minds of both old and young. It is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable we ſhall ever meet again on a <hi>ſimilar,</hi> and perhaps never, all of us, on <hi>any</hi> occaſion. This, be it as it may, is of very ſmall importance, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with one of infinitely greater moment. Nor is it material at what age or period of life, we quit mortality, whether in youth, in manhood, or at
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:027630_0021_0FD5C5A38D198FB8"/>
the age of a <hi>hundred</hi> years. The only important point is, that our peace be made with God, by virtue of a real, a vital union with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Without <hi>this,</hi> all our hopes are vain, and will end in fearful diſappointment, at the hour of death. For it is written, "the ſinner, though an hundred years old, ſhall be accurſed." But "precious in the ſight of the Lord, is the <hi>death</hi> of his ſaints," and "mark the perfect man, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the upright, for the <hi>end</hi> of that man is peace." To the ſoul united to Jeſus, death will prove the welcome harbinger of endleſs joys.</p>
               <p>Be it therefore, our great, our only concern, to ſecure this bleſſedneſs. To this end, let us hearken to, and comply with the calls of the goſpel, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the fleeting moments of life to the glory of GOD, and in "ſerving our generation according to his will;" and then, when life ſhall cloſe, we ſhall be gathered to our <hi>fathers</hi> in peace. Our bodies ſhall lie down in that manſion of ſilent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, "where the wicked ceaſe from troubling;" and our ſouls, through the merits of our divine Redeemer, ſhall be received to that eternal "Reſt that remaineth for the people of GOD."</p>
